0,TheLittleSongbird,'Groundhog Day' with a slasher/mystery twist,6,2 November 2017,"Saw 'Happy Death Day' as somebody who was fascinated by the concept, found the advertising interesting and good enough to warrant a view and who appreciates horror when done well. Seeing it just before Halloween as part of my Halloween celebrations, will admit to not being as bowled over by the film as would have liked but enjoying it a good deal.As surprisingly interesting as the advertising was (and there has been some dreadful advertising this year, a notable recent example being the completely mis-marketed 'Geostorm'), it is also misleading. One would expect a truly frightening film judging from the trailers, but actually 'Happy Death Day' happened to be much more than what was indicated and wasn't what one would call terrifying or sleep-with-the-light-on-for-a-week. The good news is that 'Happy Death Day' actually makes the most of its concept, refreshing having seen films recently that had concepts that they didn't do anywhere near enough with. The not so good news is that as enjoyable as it was it did feel like something was missing.It is easy to see why lots of people will like, and have liked 'Happy Death Day'. It is just as easy to see why it will be, and has been, a let-down for others. My opinion has shades of both, leaning towards the former. 'Happy Death Day' may be somewhat standard (while the concept is a pretty unique one, some of the story elements aren't), superficial (other than the lead character, the characters are developed very flimsily) and some parts don't make as much sense as they could and feel unfinished.Was expecting more from the killer twist reveal, which is not as clever and surprising as one would like and the whole ending felt rather silly and rushed to me (the killer's motive also came over as really trivial for an elaborate set-up). A little slow to begin with too, it's once the concept kicks in when 'Happy Death Day' properly comes to life and maintains that energy for the rest of the film.For all those faults though, 'Happy Death Day' is also refreshingly self-aware, almost very much aware of its standard-ness and superficiality and acknowledges it, and manages to be lots of fun, creepy-suspenseful and surprisingly thought-provoking. Gruesomely funny sums it up very well.'Happy Death Day' is a long way from amateurish visually, the photography is stylish rather than slapdash, the editing has suitably unnerving moments and the lighting is atmospheric. Christopher Landon never lets it get too heavy while not diluting the fun or scares, and the at times haunting and at others times funky soundtrack adds a lot.When it comes to the script, 'Happy Death Day' is full of knowing humour and never removes its tongue from its cheek, instead keeping it firmly intact throughout which proved to come off really well. It also really makes one think. The story execution is not perfect, but it's never dull and has some neat twists and turns that stops it from being predictable and repetitive.Jessica Rothe should become a bigger star after her excellent lead turn here, she has been acting a few years before this but this is the first time where she really held my attention and allowed me to take proper notice of her. Israel Broussard is also very believable and the two have great chemistry together. The acting on the whole is solid but essentially it's all about Rothe and she is one of the main reasons why 'Happy Death Day' is worth a viewing.Overall, a long way from perfect but quite enjoyable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Happy Death Day
1,Leofwine_draca,Groundhog Day in slasher form,5,9 October 2019,"HAPPY DEATH DAY is yet another modern-day slasher film, a difficult beast when the genre has been effectively dead in the water ever since SCREAM came out back in 1996. This one adopts a sci-fi twist by basically copying GROUNDHOG DAY left, right and centre, from the lead's reliving of the same day over and over again down to her realisation that she needs to atone for her despicable behaviour. I found that it suffers in two ways: once from the predictability of the premise (and I do love GROUNDHOG DAY) and second from making the lead just too unlikeable. However, it's not all bad. The direction is brisk and efficient and some of the supporting performances are well judged; the humour also tends to work better than the horror, although not always. The double-twist ending doesn't really satisfy, however.",Happy Death Day
2,SnoopyStyle,surprisingly good,7,24 March 2018,"Self-obsessed sorority girl Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) wakes up in a strange dorm room. She had spent the drunken night with Carter. She does the walk of shame home. Her roommate Lori gives her a birthday cupcake. She's having an affair with the married Dr. Gregory Butler. As night falls, she is killed by a masked perpetrator. She wakes up once again in the dorm room and it's a deadly Groundhog Day.It's a terrific little high-concept horror. Jessica Rothe is great. Everything is great until the second to last repeat day. Once she discovers the serial killer, the next day should be nothing but gearing up to take down the killer. Instead, she goes around fixing everything which is unnecessary. She should go buy a gun or at least pepper spray. I kept waiting for her to go to the hospital during that one bad day. It does have a nice twist and the movie isn't torpedoed by that one day. This movie is a fun little surprise.",Happy Death Day
3,Prismark10,"Live, die, repeat",5,15 July 2018,"To be fair to Happy Death Day. It does acknowledge its debt to Groundhog Day however the concept of the film is not without its problems and it does run out of steam part way through. The film realises this by coming up with a splinter plot and a twist by which times it gets rather convoluted.The film begins with Tree (Jessica Rothe) waking up in the dormitory room of nice and plai student Carter (Israel Broussard.) Tree does not know him and she only met him the night before which involved drinking and presumably some sex. Tree does not remember much about what happened the night before and Tree quickly rushes out of his room.It is her birthday, there is a surprise party planned by her sorority, she is having an affair with a married lecturer and she is murdered by a masked man later that night only to wake up again in Carter's room.The scenario keeps repeating itself so Tree needs to figure out who is trying to kill her but she also resolves to become a better person rather than be one of the selfish means girls she hangs about with.As she tries to unmask the killer there is an escaped serial killer subplot. Tree misses many opportunities to just run the masked killer over. In fact Tree would had been better off to go get a Magnum 45 and blow the killer's head clean off when they showed up. It would had been a short movie though.The film does try to be smart with its plot. It is a nice mixture of horror, thriller and comedy but it just runs out of gas. Each time Tree wakes up and leaves the dormitory the same events take place outside even if she rushes out of Carter's room or stays in to talk with him. That certainly is timey-wimey gone wrong.",Happy Death Day
4,claudio_carvalho,Surprisingly Good,7,1 November 2018,"On the day of her birthday, the college student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) awakes in the male dormitory on the bed of Carter Davis (Israel Broussard). She learns that she was totally wasted in the previous night and she leaves Carter to meet her snobish Kappa friends. Then she despises Carter that brings her bracelet that was forgotten in his room; ignores the calls of her father that wants to have lunch with her; visits the office of her professor Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken), who is married and is having an affair with her; and despises her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine) that gives a cupcake to her. During the night, Tree goes to a party at the Sigma house but is murdered by a hooded masked man while crossing a tunnel. Out of the blue, Tree wakes up on her birthday day on the bed of Carter and relives the day, when she tries to find who might be the killer.""Happy Death Day"" is a surprisingly good film, with the combination of horror, romantic comedy, mystery and thriller genres. The most important is the humor and Jessica Rothe´s performance is great in the role of the cynical Tree Gelbman. There are jokes also with ""Groundhog Day"" and teenage slashers and campus movies that work very well. Her list of suspects is hilarious and the dark humor of the alternate ending is a plus of the DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Te Dá Parabéns"" (""The Death Gives Happy Birthday"")",Happy Death Day
5,kosmasp,Once more with (a) feeling,7,13 May 2020,"The basic premise is simple yet it is quite fascinating that the concept of doing a horror movie with the Groundhog day idea was not done before successfully. It really offers itself up. And while this is quite simple and basic, it is well done and fun to watch.To reach a broader audience this is still held ""back"" a little bit (so nudity or excessive blood/violence), but still enough or maybe even too much for some I reckon. It made money so the logical thing of course happened with a sequel (in 2019 which I haven't watched yet). If you don't mind the cliches and the flaws in general, this will be entertaining enough and suspensful enough for you",Happy Death Day
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Definitely way better then I had expected.,7,23 September 2019,"Jessica Rothe shines through in this tongue in cheek horror. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, the characters, means of death, and outlandish humour move it into the horror comedy genre.I loved the reference to Groundhog Day at the end of the film, I would imagine there was some sort of in joke there, and of course any film that involves the loop storyline will have reference to the great Bill Murray film.There were some great twists and turns, the best one coming at the end. This was very enjoyable. 7/10",Happy Death Day
7,jboothmillard,Happy Death Day,6,30 October 2017,"It was a fantastic coincidence this film came out close to when I was celebrating my 30th birthday, the trailer for this scary movie looked great, a cross between Groundhog Day and Scream, ""Groundhog Slay"" if you like, from Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Whiplash, Get Out), so I was really looking forward to it. Basically Teresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (La La Land's Jessica Rothe) wakes up on her birthday, Monday 18th September, in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis (Israel Broussard) following a heavy night of drinking. Tree leaves and spends the day being self-centered, dismissive and condescending to her fellow classmates and previous hook-ups, ignores calls from her father, throws away a cupcake made by her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine, Matthew's daughter), and is having an affair with her professor Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken). That night, Tree is heading to her ""surprise"" birthday party, when she is lured into a tunnel, there she is murdered by a hooded figure wearing a baby mask, the campus mascot. Tree wakes up in the morning, in the same dorm as before, and the previous day's events repeat, unnerved Tree relives the same day again, but avoids the tunnel. Instead she returns to the sorority house for her party, Tree enjoys herself and quickly hooks up with her classmate Nick Sims (Blaine Kern III), but the masked killer is there, he murders Nick, then kills her. Tree is terrified to find herself repeating events all over again, she is trapped in a time loop, she avoids her death this time by barricading herself in her room, but she is murdered again when the killer, Babyface, was hiding in the bathroom. During the next loop, Tree tells her story to Carter, he suggests she take advantage of the loop, make a list of all the suspects to figure out who is trying to kill her, she spends the next few loops following suspected students, all of which end up with her murdered as she stalks the wrong person each time. Tree also takes advantage of her situation and enjoys the reactions of everyone seeing her walk around the campus completely naked. On the next loop, Tree passes out following her previous death, being bludgeoned by a baseball bat, she is taken to hospital where she finds she has retained damaged from her other murders. Then she finds herself chased by the killer again through the hospital, until she escapes in Butler's car, while driving at high speed she is pulled over by a police officer, she volunteers to be arrested to avoid being killed, however Babyface shows up and blows her up with leaking gas and a match. Waking up in Carter's bedroom again, Tree convinces him of the predicament knowing a number of events before they happen, going to a restaurant, she admits she doesn't like who she's become, including being distant from her father, since the death of her mother three years ago, they shared the same birthday. Tree sees the local news broadcast report, that serial killer Joseph Tombs (Rob Mello) is being held in the hospital, she concludes he is the masked killer. Tree races to the hospital to warn of Tombs' escape, the killer breaks free and nearly kills her, Carter follows and ends up killed by Tombs, Tree is chased into the bell tower, realising Carter will remain dead if she doesn't restart the loop, she hangs her from the tower. During the next loop, Tree spends her time righting the various wrongs she has caused, ending her affair with Dr. Butler, and meeting her father David (Jason Bayle) to resolve their situation. That night, Tree prepares to stop Tombs, he has the upper hand, but uses the knowledge of a blackout to disarm him and shoot him to death, she relieved to finally be free, and celebrates her birthday in her room, eating Lori's cupcake. However, the next morning, Tree is horrified to be waking up on her birthday again, killing Tombs did not stop the time loop, she is distraught and returns to her room to run away. Lori is there to offer her the cupcake again, Tree realises she died in her sleep, she never consumed the cupcake before, she realises Lori is the real Babyface, the cupcake is poisoned, and had access to Tombs with her job in the hospital. Lori confesses that she was jealous of Dr. Butler having an interest in Tree, the two fight, Tree manages to stuff the cupcake into Lori's mouth, before kicking her out of the window, she falls to her death. Tree and Carter reflect on the day's events back at the restaurant, he offer her his room for the night, and comments that her situation is the movie Groundhog Day. Tree wakes up the next morning, she believes she is in another loop when the first few events repeat, but then Carter tells her it is Tuesday 19th September, he pranked her, she is mad for a moment, but then they relax and kiss. Also starring Rachel Matthews as Danielle Bouseman, Phi Vu as Ryan Phan, Laura Clifton as Stephanie Butler and Ramsey Anderson as Keith Lumbly. Rothe is well cast as the college student who has so many flaws that there are plenty of people who would want to kill her, the time loop format has been done before in various genres, thrillers like Source Code and sci-fi like Edge of Tomorrow, this is one of the first in the scary movie category. It is not really that scary, it has the odd small jump and creepy element, but it is very witty, satirical with the campus setting, and making obvious jokes about its own slasher movie format, it is just an enjoyable popcorn movie and crowd pleaser, perfect if celebrating your birthday as well, a fun horror. Good!",Happy Death Day
8,Woodyanders,Reliving your last day until you get it right,8,28 November 2018,"Self-absorbed college student Tree (a delightfully tart and spirited performance by the fetching Jessica Rothe) finds herself trapped in a nightmarish continual cycle in which she reexperiences the day she was murdered over and over again until she figures out the identity of her killer.Director Christopher Landon keeps the involving and tricky story moving along at a brisk pace as well as expertly builds plenty of tension, maintains an engagingly breezy and sardonic tone throughout, and stages the shock set pieces with skill and flair. Scott Lobdell's clever script offers lots of neat variations on the time loop premise, further spices things up with amusing touches of inspired sharp humor, and even provides a surprisingly touching transitional arc for Tree in which she eventually learns to become a better and more considerate person.Moreover, it's acted with zest by a game and capable cast, with especially praiseworthy contributions from Israel Broussard as bumbling nice guy Carter, Ruby Modine as sweet roommate Lori, Charles Aitken as hunky professor Gregory Butler, and Rachel Matthews as the snarky Danielle. Rothe's winningly brash persona keeps this movie humming and makes Tree an easy character to both root for and care about. Bear McCreary's robust score hits the rousing spot. Toby Oliver's glossy widescreen cinematography gives this picture an impressive slick look. A super fun and satisfying winner.",Happy Death Day
9,Tweekums,"Horror, comedy and mystery in a twist on 'Groundhog Day'",8,22 September 2020,"College girl Tree Gelbman is about to have the worst birthday of her life... repeatedly. She wakes up in the bed of a boy she doesn't know. As her day progresses and she interacts with various people it becomes clear that she isn't a particularly nice person. When night falls she heads to a party and gets murdered by a person in a mask. She isn't dead though; she wakes up once again in the boy's bed, this time she knows his name is Carter. She is about to relive the same say over and over; the way she dies may change but she always ends up being killed. She figures that if she is to make it to the next day she will have to identify the killer before it is too late. In the process she learns some truths about herself.I wasn't expecting too much of this film but ended up pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be a cross between 'Groundhog Day' and a slasher but it was better than that. It is far less gory than I expected and it doesn't dwell on how Tree dies each time. Instead it develops her character nicely as the day of her death repeats. There are moments of tension and some good scares as well as more laughs than I expected. The way she goes about uncovering her killer gives the story a decent mystery which is likely to keep the viewer guessing till the final reveal. Jessica Rothe did a fine job as Tree. Making her character believable despite the impossible situation. The rest of the cast was solid playing the various horror/college comedy stereotypes nicely, often with a slight twist. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans wanting more humour than gore.",Happy Death Day
10,BA_Harrison,Hope you have a killer birthday!,8,4 November 2017,"If you get a strong sense of déjà vu watching Happy Death Day, that's because it takes the basic premise of Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day and adds a whole heap of familiar slasher clichés. But whilst undeniably derivative, the film still manages to be huge fun. At first one wonders whether it will succeed in offering anything beyond its high-concept mash-up premise, but as things progress it becomes clear that we're in safe hands, writer Scott Lobdell delivering a clever and witty script with director Christopher Landon confidently handling the action so that repetition never seems boring.Replacing Murray's obnoxious weatherman is attractive but self-obsessed sorority bitch Tree (Jessica Rothe) whose birthday brings an unexpected surprise—death!—a psycho in a mask attacking her as she makes her way to a party. To Tree's horror, she is forced to relive the day again and again until she can work out the identity of her murderer and prevent herself from being killed. As in Groundhog Day, Tree is able to change the course of her repeated day with the knowledge she has gleaned, and ultimately becomes a much nicer person in the process. In the Andie MacDowell role is Israel Broussard as nice guy Carter Davis, who tries to help Tree with her terrible predicament.Equal parts wry comedy and PG friendly horror, Happy Death Day isn't about to scare your socks off, but thanks to fine performances from a solid cast, some imaginative plot twists, and a snappy pace, it's still hugely entertaining stuff that should appeal to horror and non-horror fans alike.",Happy Death Day
11,moonspinner55,Derivative half-comic slasher flick proves you can't go wrong when you steal from the best,7,23 October 2017,"Jessica Rothe is amusingly pithy and savvy playing a selfish college beauty, a spoiled sorority sister who rules the school until she is stabbed and killed on her way to a surprise birthday party by a masked lunatic. But fate plays this campus cutie an unusual hand once she discovers she's living her birthday over and over again, each time attempting to cheat death but always running into her attacker. Screenwriter Scott Lobdell isn't trying to sneak a slasher variant of ""Groundhog Day"" passed us--he's upfront about the similarities, even exalts in them, while toying with all the possibilities such a scenario can offer. It takes Rothe three tries to fully comprehend what's happening to her; once she formulates a plan (creating a suspect list), Lobdell mixes things up, so that the movie rarely feels repetitive. Our heroine, snarky to start, follows Bill Murray's example and becomes a better person on her twisted journey (reestablishing contact with her father, apologizing to her roommate, even causing her own demise on one occasion to prevent the cute nerd from the boys' dorm from losing his life). Director Christopher B. Landon deserves credit for delivering a modern-day thriller with lots of action but no gore and no nudity. If it isn't quite a family-friendly slasher flick, it certainly is a squirrelly, sassy one, with some big laughs counterbalancing the suspense. Good show! *** from ****",Happy Death Day
12,paul_haakonsen,"Wake up, relive the same day, die, repeat...",6,23 December 2018,"While ""Happy Death Day"" hardly was a groundbreaking movie, it certainly turned out to be more entertaining than I had initially anticipated it to be.The storyline is fairly straight forward; a college girl is stuck in a loop of reliving her birthday over and over and finding herself killed come evening of every day. Yeah, very much similar to ""Groundhog Day"", except for the dying horribly in a new way every day.It wasn't as much the dying repeatedly that made the movie interesting, but the way that each day progressed in an exact same way, but with little variation added each and every day. And the fact that the audience is kept fairly in the dark about what is really happening. I hadn't predicted the outcome of the movie, so it was a nice surprise to me when it was revealed what was actually going on. Especially since there weren't really any hints leading you to that conclusion.I also liked the way that the director slowly build up the storyline and added small fragments to the storyline with each passing day. I like the fact that the audience have to guess to the outcome of the storyline, because that meant the movie wasn't predictable.The acting in the movie was good, especially taking into consideration the genre of the movie. Not that I am generalizing or anything here, it is just that these late teen movies have a tendency of following the same formula. Which I was glad to see that ""Happy Death Day"" didn't abide to.All in all, ""Happy Death Day"" is an enjoyable movie and entertaining at the same time. However, this is not the type of movie that can sustain more than a single viewing, because all the excitement and thrills dissipates once you've seen the movie the first time and know the plot. So chances of anyone seeing this movie more than once is slim to none.",Happy Death Day
13,Quinoa1984,"entertaining, a breakthrough performance for Rothe, not without flaws",6,27 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is the first slasher movie I can think of that we've had in theaters for a while (I don't know if I can count Hush, since that was a two-hander for the most part and was Netflix), or... no, I think I can think of a few others if I try, but the problem is much of the horror movie product put out by Hollywood is PG-13. There are some exceptions, but for the most part it's ghost story stuff and Jump-Scare Central. The pleasant thing about Death Day is that it's more concerned with the characters, and it gets those right - or, at least, it gives us a likable heroine who has an arc - and while the movie had its flaws, it does as well as it can as far as being a (somewhat bloodless) PG-13 slasher in a time when any slasher at all is hard to come by. It may have over-stayed its welcome as a genre, but any kind of movie done well is welcome for my eyes and ears.The key thing with this movie is that it takes its concept: Groundhog's Day in a modern college setting, with the Bill Murray a bitch-ish sorority girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) who has a sour relationship with her father and most everyone around her, and who happen to know the worst-kept secret around that it's her birthday, all leading up to her being killed by a guy in a creepy big-baby-man mask. She wakes up in the same hungover state she woke up in the day before, and it's the same day again... why is this happening? What's the cause? Wisely, the filmmakers don't explain it - what would work here that could be plausible (Edge of Tomorrow found a way, but that involved giant aliens with day-looping blood or something) - and instead it becomes about her journey in discovering herself and that, as the saying goes, we can change one day at a time.It's a high concept movie, the kind that Hollywood (for better and/or worse) made more of in years gone by, and it's anchored by a fun, entertaining and dramatic turn by Rothe; she can do anything that's thrown at her, and she makes the funny lines and reactions click (including, here and there, an accent or two) and when she has to get intense she carries that as well. When it comes time to reveal the killer, it almost seems too obvious, or too much like a Bob out of Twin Peaks thing, and yet... it works precisely because of that, like the filmmakers said, 'Well, it's not really about the killer, it's about Tree (damn that's a silly name, but I digress), and how she, eventually, goes from doing things each time she wakes up in her rebooted state that don't work to learning from her mistakes and trying (a little late in the game, but better late than never) to become a better person), that counts.It's actually a good message to give to younger audiences, who obviously are the main draw for this even more than horror buffs who have been around the block with slashers (again, compared to some of the stuff from the 80's this is very tame - I'd almost call it like an MTV movie when all's said and done, though for what it's worth I mean that as a compliment, I guess), that being a decent person in this time, 2017 especially, is important. The problem with the movie is perhaps more on my end, but I'm not so sure: as the movie goes along, I start to find some logic gaps, or more precisely things that Tree does that I didn't buy that, someone who clearly has some intelligence about her, wouldn't do sooner. By the time, for example, she thinks to have a weapon or two to defend herself, or decide to, I dunno, try to run away, it's very late in the story (honestly, I know there's a supernatural component to this all, however vague that is, but the fact that she doesn't at least try to haul ass out of town seems incredible to me).But I could dismiss most of the flaws in parts of the logic or little moments that didn't work because of how efficient the filmmaking is; the writing moves us along at a quick clip with the pieces of the storytelling being things we can latch on to (nothing is *too* frivolous, if that makes sense), and the direction is slick enough and often creative in its low budget, that I was along for this girl's journey as she uses her multiple lives this way and that. What bothered me the most was the ""twist"" that comes up in the final reel; I understand why they felt to throw that in there, but I didn't buy it and it comes at a point where the movie feels like it's over. Ironically, I wish there had been a little more running time put to showing her finding herself in her repeat-times, or a little more discovery of her being s***ty to people (she kind of realizes it at the 2/3rd's mark, it works but not as well as if it had come just a few scenes earlier). But it's this twist that... I dunno, it screams of being a studio note.But this is a slickly made and entertaining picture for the masses, and it takes a concept that's not over-done but is familiar for those who've seen it (and, however you think this touch works or not, they mention Groundhog's Day, albeit at the *very end* of the movie, almost like a Loony Tunes wink at us all) and gives it some fresh life. It's not amazing, but it's not anywhere near an embarrassment. It's sometimes fine, other times better than fine, and it earns its theatrical release.",Happy Death Day
14,BandSAboutMovies,"Sadly, we aren't living in 1981...",5,28 February 2018,"You may say that horror is on the rise, with It being the highest grossing genre film ever and Get Out being considered for major awards. But give us the 70's and 80's, when you had a murder's row of slashers and horror flicks to choose from every week at the movies or drive-in, instead one or two to pick from.Written by comic book scribe Scott Lobdell and directed by Christopher B. Landon (Disturbia, that's not even a word), the elevator speech for this film is pretty simple: it's Groundhog Day meets Halloween. Yes, every single day, Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbma wakes up and is horribly killed, only for the same day to start all over again. And again.Tree makes the heroine's journey from self-centered mean girl to action-ready final girl across the span of around two week's worth of being brutally murdered. The twist that a serial killer is involved suddenly grounds the film where previously it seemed like it was shooting for the giallo, where everyone and anyone could be the killer. That's where Becca checked out.Me? I liked it. I didn't like the end of the film allusion to Groundhog Day, with Tree admitting that she'd never seen it. It seemed like such a Scream way to get around the biggest issue this film has - it's only original because it's a mash-up of previously made movies. There's also a scene set exactly like Sixteen Candles, but this is where I realize that I'm old and that this film's target audience has probably never seen a John Hughes movie.Happy Death Day was in development for a decade, starting as Half to Death with Megan Fox attached. Director Landon even did a rewrite way back when, so when the film's producer remembered that at a meeting, she brought up the unfilmed script. Thanks to his work on the Paranormal Activity series, Blumhouse was quick to greenlight the film.The baby mask was designed by Tony Gardner, the same guy who made the Ghostface mask for Scream. There was a chance that it almost was a pig mask, but the evil baby killer face that keeps showing up in the film is pretty unsettling.There's talk of a sequel, which probably wouldn't have happened if the film ended the way it was originally intended to. In that version, we'd follow Tree to the hospital after meeting up with the real killer and she's murdered in the hospital by a nurse - who ends up being Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie, in revenge for the affair that she is having with her husband. What a downer, right?Here's the weirdest part of the movie. There's another film called Before I Fall that has the exact same plot, where a girl has to live the same day over and over again, trying to make things better but still dying. That'd be fine if the trailer for that film wasn't on the DVD for Happy Death Day! Talk about weird placement. Hey - our film may only seem original until you see a trailer for a film that you may be confused into thinking is the same film you're currently watching.Maybe my steady diet of Sergio Martino and Joe D'Amoto movies has made me crazy, because I expect more weirdness in every film I watch. That said, this is a mainstream Hollywood film made for teens and tweens, so perhaps I should have tempered my expectations. It's good, but it never makes you jump, it never really makes you think (pther than the gigantic plot hole that if each death starts adding up, even after the happy ending isn't going to be so happy, but that's just ignored) and it passes by rather quickly.",Happy Death Day
15,Coventry,Dead Girl on Campus,6,4 December 2019,"The idea behind ""Happy Death Day"" isn't new. Duh, everybody knows that! But wait, actually, I'm not talking about the obvious link with ""Groundhog Day"". Practically every reviewer around here already referred to the Bill Murray classic, and even the film itself mentions it as an obvious influence. What I mean is that more or less the same plot concept has already been used in the horror genre as well. In 2006, at the Brussels Fantastic Film Festival, I saw a neat little movie called ""Gruesome"" (also known as ""Salvage"") and the plot is identical to ""Happy Death Day"". That film ended up in total indie-obscurity, whereas ""Happy Death Day"" became a tremendous big hit. Too bad, because ""Gruesome"" is a fun and competent, albeit insignificant little horror gem. And ""Happy Death Day"" is just that, too!I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this light-headed, tongue-in-cheek and spirited horror comedy. Director Christopher Landon (""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"") knows exactly what type of ambiance a tale such as this requires. The film luckily doesn't take itself seriously, and in that case, I also mercifully forgive the copious errors in logic & continuity, as well as the lack of excessive gore & bloodshed due to the dreadful PG-13 rating. Tree - short for Theresa, apparently - is a college student of the most obnoxious and loathsome sort. In fact, her entire sorority behaves like the girls in the hilarious series ""Scream Queens"". Tree thinks she's better than everyone else, humiliates her fellow students, sleeps around with professors, and is generally unpleasant to be around. She gradually changes, however, when she's unwillingly forced to relive her last day (simultaneously her birthday) over and over again because it always ends with getting butchered at the hands of a mean killer with a baby mask. Why a baby mask? Because it's the mascot of the local campus football team, and the masks are sold in every shop on every corner of the street, so literally everybody can be the killer. I must admit I really loved the performance of lead actress Jessica Roth. She carries the film seemingly without effort, her transformation from a cold-hearted shrew into a likable heroine almost comes naturally, and she has good chemistry with her male co-star Israel Broussard. ""Happy Death Day"" is a slasher, and I still think that slashers must contain extreme violence, and therefore cannot be rated PG-13. Hence, I can't bring myself to give a rating higher than 6/10, but it was a fun little movie and I will definitely watch the sequel(s).",Happy Death Day
16,Hey_Sweden,You say it's your birthday...,7,1 March 2019,"Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is a stuck-up, self-absorbed sorority girl who's having one Hell of a very bad birthday - over and over and over again. It always ends with her being slaughtered by a masked maniac. Frustrated beyond belief, she tries various means of breaking the cycle, sometimes with the help of a nice-guy frat boy named Carter (Israel Broussard).""Happy Death Day"" is a reasonably clever attempt to blend the ""Groundhog Day"" premise with a conventional modern slasher; it's no great shakes, but it held this viewers' attention thanks to tip-top pacing and a genuinely high excitement level. Plus, part of the whole point of the story (concocted by Scott Lobdell) is the Tree character arc: she starts out as pretty unlikeable, and soon starts regaining her humanity, eventually realizing that each day presents more opportunities for her to be a better person (the films' main message).Given that the rating is PG-13, some viewers will be let down by a lack of nudity and excessive gore, but the film doesn't really need these elements to work. It benefits from a very capable performance by sexy lead Rothe, who becomes completely irresistible when she channels her inner badass and attempts to take the fight to the person whom she believes to be her nemesis.The performances by the largely no-name cast are engaging: Ruby Modine as Lori, the roommate, Charles Aitken as the married professor / lover, Rachel Matthews as the snooty Danielle, Rob Mello as a criminal named Tombs, etc.All in all, a respectable effort, well directed by Christopher Landon (the son of Michael Landon), that has already spawned one sequel (with a number of the same characters / cast returning).Still, this viewer felt that actually name-checking ""Groundhog Day"" at the end really wasn't necessary; most of us get the joke.Seven out of 10.",Happy Death Day

It is her birthday and, as the day unfolds, we discover that Tree is not a very nice person. So we are quite pleased when, towards the end of the day, she is slaughtered by a knife-wielding maniac. Then she wakes up and it's her birthday again. She thinks this is some sort of weird bad dream. Until she gets slaughtered again, in different circumstances. Third time round, she freaks out. But as she continues to die on a daily basis, she gradually begins to put pieces together.Yes, you're right: it's Groundhog Day - they even specifically reference the Bill Murray classic. And it's a stroke of genius to transfer that idea into a teen slasher format, together with a dose of Butterfly Effect. This film is nicely written by comics writer Scott Lobdell. The story is good, the dialogue is fresh and fun, and Tree is a very well thought out character.And Jessica Rothe plays her very nicely, bringing out her self-centredness right from the start, but not making her so very obnoxious that we don't sympathise with her predicament as she gradually starts to change. It's an accomplished performance of a fairly complex character, and it must have been a joy for her to get such a part,I see quite a lot of college slasher-type movies in the course of satisfying my movie habit.

Finding Vincenzo Natali's Haunter (2013-also reviewed) (which has the same ""hook"",but a darker tone) to be superb,I was excited to spot a film on the big screen with a similar set- up,which led to me joining in the Death Day.View on the film:Setting the timer,the screenplay by X-Men Comic-Book writer Scott Lobdell spends the opening 15 minutes cheekily ribbing the clichés of the Slasher genre,via Davis being the well-meaning pretty boy,Tree being the popular,mean ""it girl"", and Tree's entire clique being based around showing the nerds who really is too cool for school.Catching Tree in a time loop,Lobdell gives the shiny Slash shocks sharp, underlying psychological terror, as each time she is murdered,leads to Tree getting increasingly raw fears that she will never escape the loop. Along with slicing up over a dozen, weapons- grade ""Final Girl"" battles, Lobdell takes an excellent stab at Horror-Comedy, that shines in each attempt Tree makes to survive the day,from Tree walking round the campus care-free and naked,to the headache Tree gets of having to re-live a deadly morning routine.Perfectly stepping in time with Lobdell, director Christopher Landon & cinematographer Toby Oliver turn the Slasher Knife with an irresistible Pop-Rock atmosphere,of whip-pans around the campus,and neon lights over the killings that creates a party mood.Backed by a jumpy score from Bear McCreary and a great mask designed by ""Ghostface"" creator Tony Gardner, Landon gets into the Slasher groove with ultra-stylised tracking shots following Tree and the psycho,and overlapping slo-mo eyeing the wear and tear Tree experiences in the loop. The only one aware of what is happening, Jessica Rothe gives an excellent performance as Tree,whose sarcastic dry-wit Rothe hits with a real relish,that transforms into a tough, thoughtful confidence,as Tree wishes her killer a happy death day.",Happy Death Day

One of the films' finest qualities is the utterly original and impressive storyline at the heart of the film. Even though it can essentially be boiled down into being a horror-based version of another mainstream film, the concept is still unique and creates a lot to really enjoy with this one. The freshness of this type of spin on the typical slasher material makes for quite a fine charge by essentially turning the genre on its side with the final girl being killed every time and keeping the film revolved around that struggle for the duration of it's running time. That leads into the films' most striking point where this one keeps relying on unique and inventive methods to keep doling out the same treatment over and over again in different scenarios and locations for its' horror scenes. After initially encountering the killer in the walkway out on campus to then being taken out during the birthday celebration in the sorority house which has a series of striking visuals with the strobe lighting taking place throughout the scene and then ushering in the series of extremely fun and engaging montage pieces of her going around investigating the different suspects before being attacked which is insanely fun while moving this along nicely. The fact that this one manages to tie it into her trying to stay on top of the repetition and investigations into what's happening creates a nice sense of surprise with how the killer will emerge and take her out as the differences in the day's activities mean that the surprise comes from how it changes around to have them pop up despite all the changes. Once it delves into the need for her to engage in behavioral changes to ensure there's no more repeating of her situation, this creates a strong and impressive emotional resonance for the final act which is a fun brawl around the hospital which end this one on a high note. While these here are what make this one fun, it does have a few minor flaws. This is strictly based on the killers' motivation, which is inherently lame and doesn't make any sense at all. As well, the fact that there's never any mention as to why the repetition keeps occurring at all since this point is completely glossed over and never brought up at all. These minor issues keep this one down slightly.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",Happy Death Day

When a masked killer suddenly takes her life in a brutal attack, she once again wakes up in Carter's bed unharmed. Now, she must relive the same day over and over until she figures out who murdered her.Happy Death Day is a refreshing spin on the horror genre. Granted, it's not going to win any awards for originality, but for the sheer element of fun the narrative holds, you'll be hard pressed to find a horror that will make you laugh and squirm at the same time.It doesn't hide the fact that the film is referencing Groundhog Day within an inch of its life, or that it depends a lot on the first Scream film, especially during one of the many kills, which only adds to the charm of the film.For veterans of the genre, the identity of the killer is really easy to spot from the first act, as the red herrings are so blaringly obvious, it makes the film all the more hilarious for doing so. The baby face killer 'screams' of Ghostface from said film, but the lack,of the killers voice makes the character just that little more sinister.As expected, the film gives Tree a lot of life lessons, and some of the sequences where she repeats her day are laugh out loud funny, and frustrating at the same time.The only thing that lets the film down a little is the inclusion of a serial killer in the hospital, only because its glaringly obvious it's just to distract the viewer.But all in all, it's a refreshing spin on a much trampled on genre, horror films are three a penny these days, so it's a pleasure to see something that doesn't go down the quiet..........quiet..........quiet...........Bang!! route for cheap thrills.Destined to become a cult classic in years to come.",Happy Death Day

A fresh movie premise of a female college student who is murdered and must relive the same day over and over again until she solves the murder. Problem is the protagonist aka Tree Gelbman is evil; the list of enemies is way too many! What makes Happy Death day way too cool is the details. The college life and characters are so accurate. There is the snotty female rival, the activist, the nice guy etc that everyone knew in college. I love the sarcasm of the snotty sorority gal. The movie is so so un- P C which creates a guilty pleasure. There are a few cool slasher horror movie moments which pay homage to Friday 13th and Scream. Then there are a few plot devices which keeps the audience guessing. A few scenes which throws the audience into a loop, and then Happy Death Day has a horror plot twist game changer which is just classic aka memorable. 9 out of 10 stars.",Happy Death Day

Because you watch the same day over and over again, but with some mild changes, the story could becoming boring, but it actually didn't really. The actors were okay with their performances, nothing great but not bad either concidering that I didn't know any of them. There are for sure tons of movies in this genre that are below average.

It was directed by Christopher B. Landon (who also helmed the 2015 zombie horror flick 'SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE'), and it was written by Scott Lobdell. The film stars Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Rachel Matthews and Ruby Modine. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a huge hit at the Box Office as well. I absolutely loved it! Tree Gelbman (Rothe) is a very popular student at her school, who's having an affair with a married teacher and likes to party and drink a lot. She wakes up in the dorm room of a much less popular student than her, named Carter Davis (Broussard). Tree then rushes out of his room, embarrassed by what she's done, and goes about her day, which happens to be her birthday. Later that night she's murdered by a masked killer, and the next day she wakes up the previous morning, having to repeat the same day again. Tree discovers that she'll have to keep doing this, until she can learn the identity of her killer and stop them.There's been so many movies now that take a different spin on the 'GROUNDHOG DAY' storyline (like the equally excellent 'BEFORE I FALL', from earlier this year), that it seems like it should be it's own film genre by now!. This movie manages to do it in a pretty fresh and somewhat creative way though, and it's a hell of a lot of fun. Especially if you love horror flicks (like I do). Rothe is great in the lead, and Lobdell seems to be an awesomely talented director at this film genre. I can't wait to see what he does next, and I definitely recommend this movie as a Halloween treat!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",Happy Death Day

It's not especially scary, but it does have a little suspense here and there.

She wakes up in the same unfamiliar dorm room, makes the same walk across campus, has the same conversations and interactions, and is inevitably murdered. To get on with the rest of her life, Tree will have to unmask her killer before she dies yet again.This is another of those movies that I sincerely doubt was intended for people in my demographic. But it works for me. I enjoy Happy Death Day more and more with each viewing. I've now seen it three times and my rating keeps going up. What makes it special? I find the writing incredibly witty and clever. Time loop movies and television shows have been done to death, but this one feels fresh to me. I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers didn't shy away from the inevitable comparisons with Groundhog Day. Instead, they were actually smart enough to include it in the movie. And I love the blend of horror and comedy. The combination is not always easy to get right and few movies excel at it the way Happy Death Day does.In addition to the writing, Happy Death Day is blessed with a top-notch cast. Jessica Rothe is a real standout. She (and everyone involved in the film) does an excellent job presenting her character's transformation and growth throughout the film. She goes from the typical sorority b%#@h you can find in most any slasher to a well-rounded young woman with a real heart. It's all nicely done. Rothe is joined by Israel Broussard as Carter Davis - pretty much a doofus, but all-around good guy. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where their relationship is headed.Finally, I called Happy Death Day a horror / comedy. And while that's true, the movie's really more of a rom-com now that I think about it. Sure, there are a few creepy moments and some real laugh-out-loud bits, but it's more about Tree and Carter's relationship than anything else. And a cuter couple you won't find (did I really just use the word ""cuter"").8/10",Happy Death Day

she must be really dumb because i thought of two simple solutions. if the idea is to make it through the day without dying, just get in your car and drive to another state. they tried to shoe it in at the end, she said she's going as far away as possible right before she figured out her room mate is the killer. the other way is so simple. get a gun or some sort of weapon, wait for the killer to come after you and kill him.i will give it credit for one of the funniest jokes/pranks i've seen. when she wakes up at the end he is dressed in the same clothes and calls her to make her think she's reliving the same day again. priceless. and the twist was kinda decent. goosebumps started a tiny bit, but couldn't get to ownage level.",Happy Death Day

Where most pictures of the kind would try to scare or shock, this sets its sights solely on trying to entertain, using the language and influences of both its primary styles to provide a roller-coaster ride that has a good amount of edge but also knows when to pull back and have some fun. The result is a piece which isn't scary and isn't funny but is certainly enjoyable throughout, even if the ultimate 'whodunnit' reveals are a little disappointing and the machinations of the plot never quite come full circle (to the point that a few holes start to emerge).

34,ThomasDrufke,Today is the First Day of the Rest of Your Life,8,15 October 2017,"We've had a nice little resurgence of great horror films the last few years, and Happy Death Day is no different. It's really not all that scary of a film, only presenting a few jump scares here and there. It succeeds far more as a Jessica Rothe driving force of charm, wit, and charisma.Having a bit part in La La Land, Jessica Rothe gets her first starring role as Tree Gelbman, a college student who awakens in an unknown dorm room on her birthday and finds herself reliving the same day over and over again as an unknown masked person stalks and murders her each night. As I said this isn't a film that will keep you up at night, instead, it works with its (semi) unique story structure and rapid pace. Yes, this film feels a whole lot like Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, heck, it even mentions the inspiration at one point. But there's something to be said for a horror film to have such a fun tone and lead. Seriously, this film lives and dies with how good Jessica Rothe is.Luckily, there's a few twists and turns along the way to keep the film from falling into typical horror clichés (which is does inevitably do every now and then). However, as long as the film is entertaining and presents a serviceable script with likable performances, that's enough to keep me in the theater. Granted, the script and some supporting performances are admittedly bland. I always feel like young actors have a tough time pulling off realistic students, high school or college. The script is smart as a whole, but some individual lines are something I would expect from a really low-budget horror film, not something that would come from Blumhouse Productions.What I will say about Happy Death Day is that it's one of the few horror films that I think is pretty easy to re-watch. Nothing nightmarish attached, a very enjoyable turn from Rothe, and a well structured mystery- thriller. It's weird to say, but the horror genre is really starting to grow on me.7.8/10",Happy Death Day
35,Cineanalyst,"""You Know What Your Little Scenario Reminds Me Of?""",7,18 February 2021,"That's right, woodchuck-chuckers, it's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993)! Also, live, die, repeat, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) and other entries before and since in the emerging time-loop genre. Not much new is done with this iteration, ""Happy Death Day,"" except to mix it with older, more-established genres. In this case, the slasher film and, to a lesser extent, a whodunnit murder mystery. The mystery is relatively poorly executed and none too interesting, but the construction works well enough as a violent horror flick. There's the usual, Michael Myers ripped-off masked madman, and the protagonist is the typical victim of a sexually-promiscuous sorority girl. Not quite the video game similarities of ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" or the mirrored psychologizing of ""Russian Doll,"" the shaggy-dog slacker ethos of ""Palm Springs"" (2020), let alone the cinematically-reflexive philosophical and religious musings offered by ""Groundhog Day.""As in all them, though, we get the romantic coupling. In this case, it's not well fleshed out--mostly serving merely for the repeated ""walk of shame."" The boy is poorly developed. Is he a nerd trope? A ""Scream"" (1996) type side-character who helps negotiate the protagonist's and, thus, our understanding of the situation? Or just a vestigial non-entity there because the filmmakers think every movie needs romance? (Having since seen the sequel, I think it's the latter.) The aforementioned three movies all do better to make their coupling integral to their scenarios, and ""Russian Doll"" actually avoids the cliché.Criticisms aside, I do enjoy even a half-baked time-travel plot, and it works well enough as coupled with the slasher genre. Much of the appeal of these movies, after all, is in the excess of the gore, both in the victimizing from the masked killer (who, as in the original ""Halloween"" (1978) represents the unseen film's spectator) and the victim's revenge against that unknown figure. Within and in its entirety, it's a formula repeated again and again with slight variations, with the spectator all the while being allowed to switch sides and get off scot-free.",Happy Death Day

It also happens to be her birthday, and they throw her a surprise party, except that she never arrives because, well, she is murdered on the way there - and wakes back up in the dorm room.It is sort of one of those mystery films where she is trying to figure out who the murderer is so that she can break out of the loop, and there does happen to be a few twists in it as well. In fact, one of the good things about this film is that there are multiple people dressing up as this rather creepy university mascot (that happens to be a one toothed baby) so you don't know who the murder is and, well, who just happens to be a person that has dressed up.It was billed as a comedy/slasher flick, but I can't necessarily say that it was hugely funny. Still, it was different, and one of the interesting things about this film is that everytime the loop happens, Tree gets weaker, which sort of ups the ante somewhat (which is certainly different from Groundhog Day, though I'm not sure how long he actually spent in that loop, though we do know how many days Tree was trapped - 11 days).It was good, and I must admit that I quite liked the twists as well. I also liked how the experience actually makes Tree a better person. The big reveal was a little odd though, but I won't actually say what it happens to be, namely because it is a bit of a spoiler (though if you watch the trailer for the sequel they sort of spill everything anyway). Yeah, I liked this film, it was different, and surprisingly entertaining as well.",Happy Death Day

I liked the 10 first minutes till the miss found a music box in a tunnel.how exciting i thought,but then the looping started ,same subject over and over till i guess this went on for 7 times or whatever.Then i thought that this must be the end(it definitely should have been)but it lasted even further 15 minutes and 2 more loops into a very disappointing end.looping movies are difficult to make and looping horror movies are a supertight narrow genre to succeed in, and i think this film lacked fantasy and intelligence to wake interrest. this script has no originality at all.take a look back to the 80's and learn.....we shall all praise the headactress's nice appearance and patience on the screen,and also the editing and cinematography of this film,which makes a recovery of the total score at 3 stars",Happy Death Day

I enjoyed the subtle humor thrown into this horror, as well, almost making it a horror comedy (but not entirely). Tree Gelbman - well played by Jessica Rothe - is not a very nice person, so its no wonder someone might want her dead. The film offers interesting character development and evolves into a 'who done it' murder mystery. The acting from the entire cast was very good.Director Landon successfully made this look like a bigger budget film than its small $4.8 million budget. I had a lot of fun with this and will no doubt be watching this a few more times still. Well done!",Happy Death Day
45,cruise01,Happy Death Day is plenty of fun to be had for a slasher flick.,7,15 October 2017,"Living the day. Getting murdered. And repeating the same day all over again. This how goes for Happy Death Day which is a fun slasher film that borrows the same concept from Groundhog Day film. Where the main character lives their day and gets murdered by a mysterious person in a pig mask. And repeat the day all over again. The thought of the concept may seem like it can get boring very fast with its repetition. Happy Death Day does not take itself seriously which there is no complaints about that. Since it was a fun slasher film and the director knows the direction that is aiming for. Tree (Jessica Rothe) wakes up in a dorm room after a wild night of partying. She wakes up next to Carter (Israel Broussard) which she assumed she slept with him. She goes on about her day. Trying to avoid her ex boyfriend. Ignoring her father calls after a difficult past which she has trouble moving on from. She is bored with her frat house which is judgmental to everyone's single move and choices. And it is also her birthday. As she was walking to a party at night. A killer wearing the campus mascot of a pig, chases and kills her. Then, she wakes up to the beginning of the day again. Noticing that everything is repeating itself. Every time she is getting killed. She is also getting weaker from those deaths. She will have to do whatever she can to solve her own murder by finding out who is behind the mask and what their motive is. Happy Death Day is a fun movie. Seeing Tree come back alive and trying to redo a scenario over and over is fun to see. See how she tries to figure out who the killer is entertaining. Sure, there is cheesy moments were she goes all out in night gear and night vision on trying to track down everyone on her suspicious list of people. Even, moments were she does not care and takes advantage of the whole situation when she knows she can do anything cause the day will end with her death and it will all be repeated. Jessica Rothe did good with her role. There was a bit of a character development with the movie. The movie begins with Tree waking up from a crazy party. She is not a nice person. She is rude. She sleeps around. Even with her college professor. Somewhat a dead beat towards her roommates. But the movie does have a bit of a self discovery learning curve for her. It may try to be an emotional curve, were she is realizing how wrong of a person she was. The movie does have a couple of twists that somewhat worked in the film. The concept of Tree repeating the day over and over again after being killed has been done in other films like Groundhog Day, Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow, etc. Those films have reasoning for the characters to be stuck in that time loop. One thing that disappoints with Happy Death Day is there is no reasoning behind Tree repeating the same day. Besides Tree referring the situation as déjà vu. It would have been neat if it took the supernatural approach with the character stuck in the loop. But it leaves you open for the concept with no explanation. Overall, Happy Death Day is a fairly okay slasher film. Its like Sixteen candles meets scream. It's a lot of fun. An okay plot that uses the Groundhog Day concept. But once the twist is revealed, it feels like the fun stops and the surprises leaves you with nothing to talk about. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend the film if you need a quick slasher horror movie fix if you want to see something fun.",Happy Death Day
46,zkonedog,Leans Into The Cliches To Appeal To Younger Audiences,5,19 June 2018,"There are some movies that try to create a sense of realism within them. There are other movies that lean into character/situational cliches to play for comedy or hijinks. Simply put, ""Happy Death Day"" squarely falls into the latter category. As such, your enjoyment of this film will likely come down to how much you can suspend disbelief at the over-the-top characters to dig into a plot that can actually be intriguing.For a basic plot summary, ""Happy Death Day"" focuses on the story of Tree (Jessica Rothe), a college student who wakes up one morning (her birthday, of all days) in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard) after an apparent hook-up. Tree then goes about her ""normal"" routine, only to be stalked that night (on the way to a party) by a mysterious masked figure. When this figure stabs her and death looks certain...she once again wakes up in Carter's room. It is again her birthday, the date is the same, and the day repeats itself almost exactly the same. As such, the rest of the film entails Tree's struggle first to figure out what the heck is happening, and then finding ways to remedy it.In terms of plot, there are indeed some interesting things happening in ""Happy Death Day"". It is very reminiscent of ""Groundhog Day"" (even outright admitting that fact at one point!) and has a number of fake-outs that shake things up and keep it from being too predictable.Unfortunately (at least for viewers like myself), that plot intrigue is really just a front for a film made for teens heading to the multiplex on a Friday or Saturday night. As I mentioned in the opener, most of the characters are so over-the-top as to be cringe-worthy (at least for more ""seasoned"" film fans), an approach that will not phase younger viewers nearly as much. I watched the movie with a sibling 13 years my junior, and she loved it!I know that ""Happy Death Day"" was probably never meant to be anything more than it is, so that's why I won't drop it down under a middling 5/10 stars. At the same time, the trailers for the film are a bit misleading, as they connote a film that looks like a serious thriller with a time-loop component. You just have to know going in that this isn't exactly the case, as ""serious"" is far from the adjective I would use to ever describe the film.",Happy Death Day
47,Floated2,Interesting concept,8,9 November 2018,"Happy Death Day was seemingly a great success for Blumhouse productions. The film is quite what to expect by the trailers and overall plot synopsis. It is considered a slasher horror film but can also be somewhat described as a sci-fi romantic comedy in a sense.The cast is great as this may be a star turning into performance for lead Jessica Rothe. At the beginning we can see as she may be somewhat unlikable but as the film progresses, she develops into a strong character in which we root for.Filled with several clever twist and overall a film better than it should have been. The sequel is coming out next year in 2019 and perhaps if is a bigger success, we may see a third. Overall Happy Death Day is a great ride from start to finish and well done.",Happy Death Day
48,eddie_baggins,A forgettable mix of comedy and horror,4,4 June 2018,"A horror/comedy shaped in the Groundhog Day repetitive nature of storytelling that worked so well for the Bill Murray classic and the more recent Tom Cruise sci-fi/actioner Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day should be a real guilty pleasure but this low-budget Blum House production isn't the happy experience it promises to be.The concept is certainly there in Christopher Landon's film as Jessica Rothe's college student Tree Gelbman finds herself reliving a birthday turned death day as she finds herself murdered on repeat by a mysterious masked figure, only to find herself waking up to the same day over and over but Happy Death Day's desire to be a Scream like horror that moulds scares with self-aware comedy ends up anchoring the film down in the middle ground that holds it back from thriving in either space.Landon's feature finds itself lacking in any real suspense or scares as Tree try's to combat her masked attacker in various ways or uncover the identity of the assailant who inflicts this repetitive pain upon her, which is a shame, as you can see how Happy Death Day would've benefited greatly had we as an audience felt the terror of Tree's plight as she looks to overcome the scenario and live to see a new day.In regards to the comedy side of things, Happy Death Day does get extra points for not taking itself too seriously, even at one stage directly referencing its similarities to Groundhog Day, but the film doesn't produce any real hearty laughs, instead a few small-scale chuckles which aren't enough to bring the film up another level in light of the scare factor being near non-existent.With the genre mash-up disappointing, the film could've been saved by a genuinely surprising or revelatory big reveal of its masked baddie but sadly upon the revelation of who is stalking Tree to a repetitive death experience, Happy Death Day disappoints in this department also.Final Say - Happy Death Day isn't a hard film to watch and has a neat enough concept but this forgettable film frustrates with its inability to master either its horror elements or its more self-referencing comedic ticks, meaning that this is a day you'd wished you skipped.2 non-sanctioned breakfasts out of 5",Happy Death Day

50,TheMovieDiorama,"Happy Death Day is serviceable as a comedy/horror crossover, but feels all too familiar.",6,27 February 2018,"Even with the concept of replaying the same day injected into the horror genre, I couldn't help but slide into my seat thinking ""oh damn this is predictable"". Essentially a young girl (who happens to be the most unlikeable teenager in the universe) is murdered. However, she relives the same day over and over again where her death resets the day. With unlimited lives, she must attempt to find her killer so that she can escape this time loop. Whilst this never ending time loop is never truly explained, and really just feels forced as a gimmick, take the film with a pinch of salt and you'll enjoy it. A combination of 'Groundhog Day' and 'Scream', it feels more like a comedy than a horror/slasher. So if you are hoping to be on the edge of your seat...you'll be disappointed. Fancy having a laugh? Then you'll love this. We all know I'm emotionless, so for the film to evoke laughter from me is an achievement. Jessica Rothe was flat out excellent, carrying the entire story on her shoulders. Her dialogue execution was on point and her comedic timing was sublime. The supporting cast...not so much. It's all focussed on Rothe and it works. The antagonistic serial killer is your average horror movie mask-wearing maniac. The reveal was underwhelming but a small little twist at the end makes it more memorable. Replaying the same scenes repeatedly with slight differences is always a love/hate affair. I love the small details that change each time, however watching the same scene over and over again may not always be engaging. Having said that, I was compelled for the most part. Oh, and one small line of dialogue that jests about deaf people and sign language did somewhat have me in stitches...does that make me a bad person? Overall, Happy Death Day is enjoyable as a comedic slasher flick albeit flawed in concept and occasionally underwhelming.",Happy Death Day

52,matthewssilverhammer,Six-Feet-Under-Ground-Hog Day,7,20 October 2017,"Happy Death Day comes from Blumhouse Productions, the studio made famous for the resurgence of horror in theaters (Get Out, The Purge, Insidious). However, this is the lightest of light thrills. Sure, it would fit in the slasher movie bin, but with its bubble gum aesthetics and goofy comedy, it's really more Freaky Friday than Friday the 13th. And in that sense, it's mildly charmingif not bright enough to be great. For starters, the premise is pretty stupid, and the execution of that premise isn't much better. A brash and awful sorority girl is forced to relive the same birthday over and over, each one ending in her own murder by a masked killer. Imagine Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow, but in the teen-screams genre and with a lot less complexity. In fact, most of its ""originality"" just comes in its blanket theft from other properties and throwing them all together: the youth world of Mean Girls; the comedy of ""Scream Queens""; the protagonist from ""The Good Place""; the scares from The Purge. It's not bad, just familiar, like we're reliving this recognizable movie just as the character relives her day. Once our girl starts trying to solve the whodunit-mystery, things get more assured and fun, as we find it easier to root for her and her insistence on not dying each day ad infinitum. Even though the deaths and scares are wanting, the other elements work, especially the humor and (gasp!) the heart. It's harmless and forgettable October fare, made more for people who hate horror than me. In other words, my wife will love it.",Happy Death Day

As the movie opens, she wakes up not knowing where she is (a guy's dorm room). Her phone tells her it's Monday. September 18, her birthday no less. The guy is Carter, with whom Tree partied the night before. Theresa takes the walk of shame back to her sorority house, where her sorority sisters are curious about the mystery guy she fell for. Later that evening, when Tree is going to another party, she is followed by a creepy baby-masked guy, who eventually stabs and kills her. Immediately, Tree wakes up and it's again Monday, September 18, 9:01 am. What is going on here? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest horror movie of director Christopher Landon, who previously also directed ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"", among others. Here Landon, working from a script by Scott Lobdell, essentially revisits ""Groundhog Day"" for the horror genre. Set on the beautiful (fictional) campus of Bayfield University, Tree has an even worse day than Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, as she knows that each day will end in death. Why is this happening to her? How can she make it stop? And who is the killer? These are the questions we want answered, and keep us guessing. The movie's got a nice rhythm to it, and there are some funny moments too. In the movie's very first seconds, the Universal musical theme starts, and restarts, and restarts again, a clever ode and sing of things to come. The movie is helped immensely by the likable Jessica Rothe, here in a leading (and break-out) role as Tree. She leads a cast of mostly no-names, and that suits this film perfectly fine. At a certain point, Tree lands in the hospital, and the doctor examining her concludes ""Technically you should be dead"", ha! Considering this movie's production budget was less than $5 million, a mere peanuts in Hollywood these days, this movie is bound to be successful no matter what.""Happy Death Day"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely (although not quite a sell-out). There is a good reason this movie is rated PG-13 It is MILES away from the all-out horror-porn that you find in the ""Saw"" franchise (which is rebooting later this month with ""JigSaw"") and similar over the top movies. ""Death Happy Valley"" is clever, sometimes scary, other times funny, always fast-paced, and before you know it the hour and a half has come and gone just like that. I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Happy Death Day

In one deja vu, she walked out in her birthday suit causing a lot of dropping jaws. Then she would make restitution for her past behavior. Most of it is when she lost her mother.

Only problem is a freak electrical problem seem to give her the ability to relive her birthday over and over again, which means getting killed over and over again until she can figure out who hates her that much to do something violent about it.It's a good movie simply for the fact that it's a bad one. The very fact that they point out that the film is the exact same plot as Groundhog Day (and the Netflix movie Naked with Marlon Wayans and the Tom Cruse movie Edge of Tomorrow which really reminds me of this flick), gives it the good excuse to be campy. Happy Death Day goes for the complete fun factor, completely focus on the homage to horror films rather just being one.Overall, it's entertaining.

58,jtindahouse,Smart horror with depth and levels,10,16 October 2017,"I'm starting to see a trend develop in modern horror movies (the good ones at least) and I really like it. Film makers are beginning to realise that for horror to work there has to be some different levels to the film. 90 minutes of watching people get killed isn't going to be able to cut it anymore. You have to be able to make the audience laugh, think and even move them emotionally. If you can do that then your film will be a success. Earlier this year 'Get Out' pulled it off and now 'Happy Death Day' has nailed it too.When the opening logos featured a joke (literally in the first few seconds of the film) I thought I may have misread the tone of the film in the trailers. Turns out I had, but in a good way. It wasn't an indication that the film was to be a laugh-fest, simply that it had that layer to it. And the thing about the layers that the film possesses it that every one of them works. Whatever it tries to pull off it manages.The twists and turns and how crafty it is about concealing them truly blew me away. At least three times I thought to myself such and such element would be better if they'd done so and so, only to later find out they did indeed have that up their sleeve the whole time. The film is incredibly smart.I can't say enough good things about this film. The trailers won't give a fair indication to people of what this film is truly capable of, and so sadly I fear many who would love it will not get around to seeing it. If you get the chance though please do see it. It's a fantastic film and you won't be disappointed.",Happy Death Day

Like the Scream films has a lot of twists, just when you think you know how it's gonna end, it then pulls out more surprises you just don't see coming.

The character seems to tick all the boxes of the typically ""badass"" heroine: she's callous, promiscuous, selfish, promiscuous, ruthless, promiscuous, and lazy. When we see she's studying medicine, we wonder how she got in; some questions are answered when we see that she is, predictably, having sex with her professor.Wow, what a bad ass!However, as Tree's ordeal unfolds, we realise we were not necessarily supposed to like this character at the outset. She was shallow and cruel, but her struggle reveals hidden depths to the character that makes you question your assumptions about such people.The movie is unfortunately not scary, which I guess is inevitable, considering the premise removes suspense from the situation - the whole point is that the character always ends up back where she was.

As others have stated this is Groundhog Day meets Scream. The idea behind this is fun but after the umpteenth time the novelty does start to wear a bit thin. What's more no explanation to this time loop is ever given. HDD is at least as much a romantic comedy as it is a horror movie. In fact die hard slasher fans will probably find this pretty tame, although the mask worn by the killer is very creepy. On the other hand those wanting a scary film but without the nastiness should find this very watchable. The production values are good, it is a well made film. Jessica Rothe plays the lead and her character is the backbone of this movie, my only criticism being that a 30 year old actress playing a part that is meant to be much younger isn't very convincing.
Overall a good fun movie with a few scares but I think many of these reviews are over generous. Doubtful I'd watch it again. Unless it's with a chick on a date!",Happy Death Day

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. First of all, it was good-I was expecting your average teen horror film. Second, it had a good story with surprising twists and that is probably because the writer of the movie is Scott Lobdell. If you are a comic fan, specifically of the X-Men, then you probably know the name. If not, he wrote on some movies too, such as X-Men:Days of Future Past & Man of the House. It's directed by Christopher Landon, who also directed the Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse & Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones. Jessica plays a not very nice college girl that gets stuck in a Groundhog Day scenario. It's her birthday and she gets killed by the end of the day. She then wakes up and relives the day, again and again. Her killer wears a school mascot mask that is kind of creepy-it looks like a baby's face-and each death is different, since Jessica tries different things to no avail-she still ends up dead. Israel is the first person Jessica sees when she wakes up-she wakes up after a party in his dorm room. Ruby is her college roommate-she is the first person to wish her a happy birthday. Rob is in the local hospital, where Ruby works as a nurse trainee...but I better not say too much about his occupation. It's better if you don't know too much ahead of time. There is lots of humor, too. I liked it when a character mentions the movie Groundhogs Day and Bill Murray to Jessica and she says she doesn't know either one. There is also a lesson to be learned by Jessica-if she learns it, will the Deja Vu loop of death finally end? Look for the opening credits where the Universal logo is circling the earth because it repeats over & over several times.

68,kluseba,One of the most entertaining horror movies ever made,10,24 November 2017,"Happy Death Day tells the story of the condescending, dismissive and self-centred student Theresa who gets killed by a masked assailant on her birthday. However, she doesn't die and wakes up in the morning of the same day. Theresa quickly realizes that she must uncover her assailant's identity to survive her birthday and therefore break the curse of experiencing her own death over and over again. Along with a male acquaintance she spent the night with, she starts investigating her potential enemies, their motives and alibis. While doing so, Theresa realizes how her own flaws have let to this tragic situation and she attempts to become a better person.Happy Death Day is one of best horror movies in recent memory. Instead of focusing on gore and special effects, the film works with a desperate, gloomy and mysterious atmosphere and a few efficient jump scares. However, the film has much more going for it. It focuses on a stunning character development as a superficial, rude and egocentric teenage girl slowly becomes a profound, joyful and empathetic young woman. This film can be considered a coming-of-age drama and it's one of the best of its kind. As if those elements weren't enough, Happy Death Day also tells us an interesting love story that becomes more and more profound as the film progresses. It also deals with family and friendship issues in a dramatic way. To lighten things up, the movie also includes humorous parts which mostly consist of absurd situation comedy and a few quirky dialogues. However, this movie succeeds where films and franchises like Evil Dead and Scream have failed before: the humorous elements never take away from the sinister moments as Happy Death Day feels perfectly balanced. The movie is genuinely entertaining from start to finish and once it's over, you simply feel like watching this roller coaster ride again and embrace this movie's unique atmosphere. Some critics and viewers have slammed the movie for having a plot that borrows heavily from the concept of Groundhog Day. This is true but Happy Death Day is executed with so much energy and originality that it simply doesn't matter. Even if you are familiar with the concept, this film will still keep you guessing from start to finish. You probably won't see this movie's outcome coming either.In the end, Happy Death Day is among the very best movies of the year and massively exceeded my expectations. If you like clever horror and coming-of-age movies, you can't get around this film. Happy Death Day is best enjoyed around Halloween with your friends.",Happy Death Day
69,davispittman,Fun popcorn movie,8,16 November 2017,"Happy Death Day (2017) is technically a horror movie, but it's really not that scary. It's a fun movie that many people will enjoy, even those who hate horror movies. I feel like the advertising for this movie lead many people, myself included, that it would just be one more very forgettable horror movie that is uninspired and boring. But that really is not what Happy Death Day is. The movie has a plot like Groundhog Day, but with a teenage murder mystery angle thrown in. Yes, the plot involving a person repeating the same day over and over has been done many times and in many different forms, but I really didn't think the plot was tired or really unoriginal. It throws in a couple twists and turns just when the audience thinks everything is all figured out. Everything's not always completely as it seems. And the cast does a great job with their performances. The main stars really impressed me. They handled their characters very well. The two main stars had really lovely chemistry too, that made everything more enjoyable. That's another word to describe the movie overall, enjoyable. This really is one to watch when you want something pretty light too. If you're looking for some good ol escapism, this is a good pick. 8/10 for happy death day.",Happy Death Day

She rushes out, and as she walks across campus several details are emphasized. She goes to her dorm where her roommate has a birthday cupcake for her, which she rejects. She runs to class. Turns out she's the married teacher's mistress. She's got a sorority meeting later. Then a surprise birthday celebration at the sorority house. She complains bitterly because she doesn't want her birthday celebrated. Sure, what college girl doesn't want to celebrate her birthday with her friends? Those in the movies. On her way to a party at night she's stalked by some guy in the university's mascot mask--a baby face. Eventually he kills her. And she wakes up again in the guy's dorm and the day repeats itself. After a couple of these cycles, she starts remembering the previous cycles more and more and realizes that she can't die. She reluctantly befriends the guy with whom she spent the night and he suggests that she actually try and find out who's killing her, since she seems to have an indefinite amount of time. She agrees and tries to avoid people or situations that led to her death previously but to no avail, she always ends up killed anyway. Finally, she has a Nitzschean epiphany and realizes all the wrongs she's done, all the people she's mistreated and in one of the cycles of the eternal recurrence of the same actually changes and decides to become a force for good. She ends up dead anyway. But by accident she discovers the identity of the killer and tries to confront him before he kills her. But then there's a twist.Happy Death Day is yet another sorry PG-13 horror movie with a dislikeable, annoying, and insolent young female lead where horror is reduced to a minimum and sexual references abound. IMBDb tells us that we have to witness 11 times the same day more or less, a completely dull and unremarkable day. This movie could have worked as an R-rated slasher, with plenty of nudity and violence. Instead as a sanitized yet politically correct PG-13 movie with an obnoxious lead character, a weak cast, and a pointless day that repeats itself, this movie has very little going for it. Rachel Matthews shines in the role of the girl running the sorority. Other than that, there's little worth seeing here.",Happy Death Day
73,peterp-450-298716,Just a mediocre horror suitable for a teen girl halloween-night,5,9 February 2018,"""I'm totally having deja vu right now.
Oh, I have it all the time.
It's supposed to mean like someone's thinking about you while they're masturbating.
I have it at least five times a day.""You can't really say ""Happy death day"" is original. You'll immediately think of films as ""Groundhog day"" and recently ""Before I fall"" when watching this time loop/slasher movie. The same principle with one crucial difference. The person trapped in an apparently infinite time loop is being murdered each time by an unknown person wearing an idiotic mask. Are you expecting a humorous ""Friday the 13th"" flick? You'll be pretty disappointed at the end of the film. It's never as exciting as the infamous slasherfilms from the 80's. And you can't call it funny either. Besides the clumsy attempt at the end when a link is made with Bill Murray and the mother of all ""time loop"" films. Unfortunately my final conclusion was already made. I'm still wondering what the fuzz was all about.""Happy death day"" was kind of a success in the US. Probably because of the release date (on Friday the 13th) and the overall design. A university campus with Tree (Jessica Rothe) as the central figure, who wakes up every morning in the room of Carter (Israel Broussard) after she got brutally killed the night before. I'm assuming she's sort of a ""Miss Popularity"" based on her arrogant attitude. Time and again she experiences the same daily routine. First awaking bewildered. Then returning to the dorm in a daze. Absently attending class. Paying a surprise visit to the attractive teacher (you never guess why). Going to a party that same evening. And subsequently, to round of the day, she's being successfully murdered. A simple storyline which is easy to follow and gradually turns into a kind of whodunit story.So, this movie is suitable for pubescent teenage girls who are balancing between childish teen films and the more serious stuff. ""Happy death day"" provides a short-lived relaxation without too many creepy elements, so that members of this age group aren't overwhelmed by outright fear. On the other hand, there's a bit of that sugary and airy mood, teen girls can identify themselves with. Tree is such a girl figure others might look up to and who they would love to have as best friend. A fairly snobbish type with also a rebellious side. Her walking around naked is a shining example of that. And last but not least, one can safely eat a maxi-pack of popcorn or a full load of nachos during this film, because you won't see really nauseating or bloody scenes. Pros enough to lure a complete teen audience into the cinema.The funniest (and most predictable) part of this film is of course the moment when the victim can predict future incidents as a true Nostradamus. The one who's witnessing this, stares at it in slack-Jawed amazement. The makers succeeded in giving it an original twist. After every rebirth, Tree suffers more and more from sustained injuries. But apart from that, this is just a mediocre film. A kind of a Columbus case which needs to be solved after several time loops. It was not easy to point out the ultimate perpetrator. To be honest, I thought that was rather far-fetched. Really a film to watch with a few friends on a Halloween night. No more, no less.",Happy Death Day
74,aidanratesmovies,Better than I had anticipated- and yet not as good as it could have been,8,30 January 2021,"It's very entertaining on all fronts, and the actors do a good job of making it feel that way, as well as up and coming horror director Christopher Landon- however it certainly lacks the smarts and wit it has on other fronts in the writing department. Jessica Rothe provides a fun leading performance in this odd horror twist. The film largely plays out as if the film Scream and Groundhog Day had a baby- and it embraces that fact to the fullest. I enjoy Christopher Landon's direction throughout the film, it gives the energy it needed, and I honestly couldn't see the film being helmed by anyone else. However, the writing also impacts the film quite a bit. Between its generic opening, and predictable moments aside- the final twist just isn't as satisfying as the film makes it out to be. In fact, it can feel frustrating, as if writer Scott Lobdell wrote himself into a ditch. In the end, Happy Death Day was far better than I expected it to be, but it still could use some improvement on terms of how to write a more compelling, less generic, and more convincing storyline.

Seeing her growl or rage in frustration one moment only to slap on a huge smile the next is wonderfully entertaining. It's definitely the kind of performance that makes me want to see her in more roles.Aside from that, it's just a fun ride overall.

80,rgkarim,Groundhog Day Meets Massacre,7,12 October 2017,"Halloween weekends are certainly a bag of tricks and treats themselves. A variety of genres try to compete for the number one spot on the box office, and horror movies continue to try to prove their worth. My weekend reviews start with another film in the slasher collection that looks interesting to say the least. Like all horror films, the truth behind the vague trailers can take a number of forms and levels of quality, so I wasn't sure what I would get on this viewing. What is the verdict? As always read on to find out!LIKES:Surprisingly Deep Character: Most slasher films fail in terms of a gripping character to follow the journey with, in order to provide fodder for our demented killer. Surprisingly, Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) has depth hidden within her superficial looks and sorority attitude. Seeing her character evolve over the film changed my attitudes towards her, especially as her sorrows began to emerge onto the field. And even more impressive is how balanced her multiple aspects were balanced into the story, to maintain the development that was so nicely done. Censored: There are those slasher movies that go over the top to maximize the vomit inducing kills and dismemberments. Happy Death Day, fortunately, is not one of those movies. For a movie about repeating the same day over with a ""deadly"" conclusion, it keeps things rather clean and to the point, avoiding the mind scarring scenes that will be famous on YouTube. The PG-13 rating should assure you that this is a rather mild horror and won't leave you sleepless like some other films can. The Mystery: If you have seen the trailers, you have probably been allured/intrigued as to who is behind that freaky baby like mask. That aspect carries on into the film as you try to piece the puzzle together and solve the Scooby Doo like case. It was the adventure of seeking those answers that kept me invested in the movie, searching for any slight hint to give away the surprise. Keep your eyes open, your minds active, and your thoughts running and you'll get it within 25 minutes, but otherwise enjoy the ride the director created. It's fun: Movies that involve repeating the same day over and over again gets stale fast, because of cheap editing tricks to make the scene seem fresh. Fortunately, Death Day keeps things fun and fairly fresh in the 1.5 hour run time. This movie has plenty of chuckles thrown into the mix, many poking fun at the horror movie genre. Tree's dialogue itself has that aggressive, sorority girl element to it, filled with passive-aggressive compliments and sarcasm that are well-timed. Throw in some well-developed secondary comedy from secondary characters, and the fun just keeps on rolling with each passing day. DISLIKES:Not Scary: My friend and I both agreed that this movie lacked any real bite in terms of the scare factor. Oh sure, a creepy, knife wielding, baby face mascot wearing killer would have anyone afraid to walk a dark corridor in the real world. With the silver screen barrier though, the movie's horror element doesn't do much to build suspense or make you shrivel in your seats. Aside from a few jump scare moments, the comedy aspect of the movie will take over more than the scare component. Sorry you fear feeding fans, no dice on this one. Little Over the Top: Ridiculous factors are all in good fun when they are timed well and not overdone. Happy Death Day sometimes lost its regulation with the overly ridiculous moments, leading to these eye-rolling proportions that were just eating up time. Some of the death scenes themselves fall in this category, alongside a few repeat sequences of Tree's journey across the quad. The running jokes themselves also get a little stale, especially when it comes to the rival sorority sister who was directed to be a little too aggressive my taste to take seriously. Oh well, got to love those superficial characters that are meant for comedy alone right. Some unfinished story elements: While I'm surprised with how much of a story this movie had, no matter how cliché it was, there were still some underdeveloped aspects to the tale. One was a few of Tree's character development arcs, that started to blossom, only to die out like her character does. A few of these could have further expanded her character, bringing in other characters to help draw it out and adding that dynamic element I like to see. In addition, a few other plot elements were squeezed into the film in a rushed manner, sometimes feeling out of place until they were able to draw it back in with a well-placed plot element. Had the scares been betterthis element would sting less, but the story element is a big part and could have used some fine tuning. The VERDICT:Happy Death Day is one of the more fun slasher films I have seen in a long time. It's a movie that will appeal to many with its fun pace, decent comedy, intriguing mystery, and character that keeps you invested in their life. While this was much better than my expectations, the movie still suffers some from imbalanced comedy gestures, unfinished story elements, and most importantly lack of scares. Therefore, go in there expecting a drama/comedy with a slasher twist and you've got the right approach to this movie. Yet, if you are looking for the next psycho thriller hold your horses for a Redbox rent to capitalize on your investment. My scores:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",Happy Death Day
81,invisibleunicornninja,"Not a perfect movie, but I had fun.",7,13 March 2018,"Plot - The longer you watch this movie, the more things you will notice make no sense. Don't worry though, pretty much everything is explained nicely in the finale. Except how the main character kept reliving the same day over and over, but to be fair, they never explained that in Groundhog Day either and any explanation for that would be pretty stupid. The Scare Factor - I think that this was supposed to be a horror movie, but its not scary at all. The blood effects may be good, but the acting is not. I was laughing so hard I think I annoyed some of the other movie theater patrons (I saw this in theaters). This film is what you might refer to as an ""unintentional comedy"" as whenever its trying to be scary or dramatic, its actually funny. The Characters - Most of the characters are dumb and underdeveloped. The main character is extremely unlikable, but that just makes it funnier. A lot of the characters are obnoxious American teenage girls, and the bad acting just makes them so much more believable and obnoxious. Some of the stupidity can get very infuriating after a while though. Sights and Sounds - The soundtrack isn't fantastic, but its decent. The sound design is overall ok. This movie has a pretty cheap vibe to it, but effort was made to make this movie look good. If you pay attention, some of the editing and the effects are pretty well done. Its not perfect, but there was clearly effort put into the presentation of this low-budget movie. Overall this movie isn't the greatest thing ever, but its fun. This movie is funny, and entertainment is to be had here. My number score mainly reflects how much fun I had watching it and not the overall quality of this movie.

82,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Happy Death Day,5,9 November 2017,"A snobby, college babe named Tree (played fiercely by Jessica Rothe) relives the same day over and over again by getting murdered via a fellow student. Tree's mission then becomes to find her killer and at the same time, try to be a better, overall person in the process. That's the rub of Happy Death Day, my latest review. So OK, I gotta hand it to ""Day"". Despite having a tiny budget, unknown actors, and being minuscule in scope, this film has grossed over $78 million worldwide. That's pretty impressive. Yeah you probably won't deem it unforgettable the moment you leave the theater (I know I didn't). However, there are worse ways to spend five to ten bucks on a cold, November afternoon (or are there?).Now if you've read the reviews, caught the opening Universal Pictures logo repeating itself, or have already seen Happy Death Day all the way through, you'll know that it apes 1993's Groundhog Day (obviousness reeks havoc as Bill Murray's name is attached in a wink wink ending). You can also throw in Edge of Tomorrow, facets of a 90's teen comedy, and Wes Craven's Scream for ""Day's"" manifest inspiration.All in all, ""Day"" is nifty, campy, and devoid of being too grave. It's also restrained as a so-so horror film (hence the PG-13 rating). With minimal gore, side characters that range from dopey to spiteful, a bland gimmick of die/repeat, and some slight humor, Happy Death Day never feels scary or amusing enough (that honor would go to John Carpenter's Halloween).Sure there's a whodunit element that keeps you guessing and director Christopher B. Landon profusely adds layers to his plot. Nevertheless, I can't quite go with a recommendation. Landon never times his scenes with Tree's 9-plus lives to make complete sense. His troupers around her find their marks but not every ""Groundhog Day"" effect feels totally in sync. Oh and I almost forgot, the editing in ""Day"" is swift and painless yet you don't know why Tree is going through the skewed, time continuum in the first place. Bewildered was my first and foremost thought.Typically, low budget scare fests find a way to be successful financially. With Happy Death Day, I get why fright fans salivated for an October release but I don't understand all the monetary love here. Rating: 2 stars.",Happy Death Day

84,vengeance20,Solid Horror!,8,20 October 2017,"Seen a trailer for this one while going to a screen of 47 Meters Down! At first, the trailer looked like a stupid comedy film, but as soon as the horror elements started & the Blum House production came up with from the makers that brought you The Purge, Paranormal Activity, etc! Etc! I sat up immediately & paid attention! Usually when you see the Blum House logo & the films they've made, you know these films are usually pretty ace! This was one of those films which you never saw coming, like I looked up a list of upcoming horror films for this year (Horror Buff Alert!) & never even saw this one on that list! It was also around the time where I thought, oh well I've seen all the horrors for this year & then... BAM! This one appears! Ace!So the film utilises the sparingly used Groundhog Day formula for the concept of this Horror film which follows a young sorority girl, Teresa, who is rude, selfish & a complete arse to everyone she comes into contact with. On the day of her birthday, an unknown killer murders her, resting the day all over again! It then occurs to her that everything she notices happened before & it's then when it happens a second & third time, she realises someone is out to kill her, but she has an unlimited supply of lives to try & find out who her killer is & why this person wants to kill her!The story-line was pretty good! I knew what the set-up was going to be like when watching the trailer, but had yet to see the full length things to see exactly what happens through-out the film when & where & how she discovers the killers true identity! The kills in the film were average, not amazing. But they were average! I felt this film lacked in the gore factor quite a bit. It could've been more on the bloody side of things in order for it to be more slasher like! In fact, I'd say this would've been more a mystery & thriller film alone, had it not been for the mask & other horrors elements!The ending I never saw coming! One reviewer said it was obvious, yeah right! It was so un-obvious! I never seen it coming & found it to be quite a surprise although the part before it had me questioning if that was it! You'll know what I mean when you go watch it...!The overall film as a whole was pretty epic & I did enjoy it! It reminded me of Scream in a lot of places! Though it lacked the blood, it was still a pretty solid horror film with some great themes going on! Not to mention the Groundhog Day formula with a horror theme laced into it! It was perfect!Overall, a solid Horror Film! 8/10",Happy Death Day
85,bkrauser-81-311064,Third Best Film About Reliving Your Day Again and Again,7,11 October 2017,"Isn't it weird that we've gotten two different teengirl versions of the Groundhog Day (1993) format in the same year? It's a little weird right? Granted there's a slight difference between the two. One centers on a selfish, white, blonde antihero whose conceited worldview is put into question when blood spilled over the course of the day forces them into an unexplained never-ending time-loop. The other is about a selfish, white, blonde antihero whose conceited worldview is put into question when blood spilled over the course of the day forces them into an unexplained never-ending time-loopin college. That and the blood spilled is her own which actually makes Happy Death Day a tad more fun than Before I Fall (2017).Happy Death Day follows college student and proto-walking disaster Tree Gelbman (Rothe), as she tries to avoid the fact that Monday the 18th is her birthday. After managing to p**s off the lion's share of campus including an ex, a professor's wife, most of her sorority sisters and her father, Tree is unceremoniously dispatched by a masked murderer while in transit to a party. In a twist of fate, Tree has the chance to relive her final day again and again in order to solve her own murder.As with any movie of this stripe that isn't written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin, Happy Death Day writes itself into a corner and begins to fall apart by the last act. What's worse is because the film is jamming its lofty premise in the lurid, sensationalist mode of a slasher movie (or about as sensationalist as a PG-13 can be), the reveals are all but guaranteed to be anticlimactic.That said, if you forgive the narrative clumsiness you can still walk away thinking this movie is a lot of fun. As our resident Mean Girl Jessica Rothe is perfect fodder for all the comically staged deaths that stop just short of turning the film into an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon. As the stakes get raised so too does her status from a screaming first-girl-dead to a semi-resourceful last-girl-standing. Granted her instincts are more High School Drama club than ""I'd like to thank the Academy,"" but for a movie like this it just works.As far as Blumhouse Productions go, Happy Death Day has more in common with Darwin Awards (2006) than this year's Get Out (2017). There are a lot of bad decisions both amongst the characters and throughout the plot. But the one truly great decision this film made: to be a comedy, makes it all worthwhile. Check it out if for no other reason than to see the third best film about a character reliving the same day over and over.

87,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Happy Death Day""- A clever horror-comedy that makes the most of its time-loop gimmick!",8,10 September 2020,"Wow, there has certainly been a deluge of time-loop stories lately, hasn't there? From quickly forgotten films like ""Before I Fall,"" to quirky mainstream comedies like ""Palm Springs,"" to popular television series like ""Russian Doll,"" audiences can't seem to get enough of these types of projects. And possibly the best of the trend is 2017's delightfully twisted and wonderfully hammy horror-comedy ""Happy Death Day!""Jessica Rothe stars as ""Tree,"" a troubled and sometimes selfish sorority girl who gets her kicks from things like ignoring others and having illicit affairs with her college professors. But things quickly change when she is murdered one night by a masked assailant... only to wake up and relive the same day over again... and then die yet again at the hands of the masked figure. With the help of a charming fellow student named Carter (Israel Broussard), Tree is able to surmise that she is stuck inside of a time-loop, destined to relive the day again and again until she can solve the mystery of her own murder and keep herself alive. And along the way, she'll also learn to confront her inner demons and maybe become a better person for it.Directed by Christopher Landon from a script by Scott Lobdell, ""Happy Death Day"" works extremely well thanks to the wonderful cast, a good blend of humor and thrills that make the most out of the time-loop gimmick, and some top-notch character development. It's a resounding success all around, and is arguably one of the best horror-comedies in recent memory.I absolutely adore the cast. Rothe, a relative newcomer, knocks it out of the park as our lead. I've only seen her once or twice in the past, but she absolutely commands the film. She gives Tree a good sense of depth, and is also just as entertaining as you could want her to be. Absolutely fabulous performance. Broussard is endlessly likable as Tree's main ally in the film, and potential romantic interest Carter. He helps ground the movie, and is a lot of fun in his part. I also absolutely loved Rachel Matthews as the school's resident queen-bee mean-girl Danielle. It's a small part, but Matthews makes quite the impression. And of course there's a small turn from Ruby Modine as Tree's long-suffering roommate Lori. She's quite good in the film and has some juicy scenes to sink her teeth into.The film's execution is also top-notch stuff. Lobdell's script skillfully mixes classic slasher-film scares with a keen sense of humor, creating a pretty ideal blend that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats while also piling on the laughs. The script also makes the most of the time-loop narrative in clever and subversive ways. There are so many fun little moments showing Tree's journey, and her just... having fun with the fact she keeps reliving the same day over and over again. And director Landon's execution of the material is pitch perfect. I've been a fan of Landon for a while now thanks to his other projects, and he's just the right fit. His sense of pacing and composition is fantastic, and he's able to execute the laughs and the thrills to perfection. In a lot of ways, he very pleasantly reminded me of early Sam Raimi in how he handles the material. And that's a very good thing.And then there's the character development, which is really the beating heart of the film. In a lot of ways, Tree's growth is more important than the story. And it is just perfect. The film does a remarkably good job at establishing Tree as a very flawed and often unlikable person at the start... but then cleverly begins to dole out little bits of information suggesting it's not really her fault, and that she has a lot of pain beneath the surface. And the story goes on, Tree eventually begins to reevaluate her life in pretty fantastic ways. It may be a bit simplistic at times, but I really appreciate it when a movie is able to take us on a journey like this. Especially a horror film, which don't always have the best track records when it comes to character development.If I absolutely had to point out any weaknesses to the film, I would say that the story perhaps takes a little too long to get going. The first few days in the time-loop can kinda drag a bit. A little tightening to ""trim the fat"" would have been appreciated. I also do think some of the twists and turns are a little... ""convenient."" But then again, the film is so much fun, I can forgive that for the most part.I absolutely adore ""Happy Death Day."" It takes a simple premise-- ""What if 'Groundhog Day' was a slasher movie?""-- and spins it into pure gold. It's arguably the best ""time loop"" story in recent memory, and it's just a blast-and-a-half to watch. I'm giving it a very good 8 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing.... again and again.",Happy Death Day

I'm starting to love it and it's becoming one of my favorites. It's like Groundhog Day, Back to the Future, and Scream all rolled into one. I've watched it about three times in the past week to get ready for the sequel. I'm very captivated by Tree's situation and seeing her evolve from snobby sorority girl, to trying to be a better person through her ordeal.Jessica Rothe stars as Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman. After a night of drinking and partying, she wakes up in Carter's dorm room on the morning of her Birthday. She quickly ditches him and goes on with her day. That night, she is stalked and killed by a stranger in a baby mask (Babyface)She wakes back up in Carter's room, only to realize it's the exact same day again. She experiences deja vu. That night, she is stalked and killed again by Babyface.She wakes back up in Carter's room again (You get the picture) She and Carter make a plan to find the killer and break the loop so she doesn't have to repeat the same day over and over and keep dying every single time.

These films are usually entertaining for all the wrong reasons and 'Happy Death Day' is no different.I'm a bit confused as to what this film is actually supposed to be. Are we supposed to take it seriously as a horror/thriller, or should we treat it as a spoof and rip-off of 'Groundhog Day'? If it is intended to be a spoof, then maybe it isn't as bad as I first thought. But even so, it does feel incredibly cheap, trashy and low-budget and its widespread popularity is a mystery to me.'Happy Death Day' is clearly appealing to some people, but not to me.

This is obviously by design, and necessary for this type of movie.
What would be the point of watching Ground Hog Day if Bill Murray was an absolute delight from scene one?The gore and horror elements are quite light making this a very easy watch.

100,rockman182,Happy Death Day (2017),7,16 October 2017,"The trailer for this film accompanied by 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"" looked  incredibly dumb, but that didn't mean that the film wasn't going to be  a stupid good time. These types of repetition of a certain day films  are somewhat popular with recent incarnations being completely  forgettable. Groundhog Day gets it right, and I was curious to see a  college slasher drama try to take a different spin on the idea.  The film is about Tree Gelbman, a typical short fused sorority girl who  loves to party and get drunk and her trials against a day that keeps  repeating. On her birthday she is murdered and the day keeps resetting  until she can figure out who her killer is. The daily death takes a  toll on her body and she gets physically weaker each time. its a tough  task having to try to figure things out when everything around her  resets and the killer and his/her motivations remain unknown.  Jessica Rothe was just perfect for this role. She's an attractive lead  who played the college girl role to a tee. Her character grows by the  end of the film and you start to feel a better connection with her as  she becomes a different human being when her constant death teaches her  about her own life. Other than that, there aren't really many fleshed  out or identifiable characters, which is fine. This is a cheap thriller  and should be treated a such, doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  The repetition surprisingly doesn't overstay its welcome and keeps  itself fun. This film is barely a horror because its so stupid and the  film knows it. Its more of a comedy with killing than anything else.  Which is perfectly fine. The killer reveal is kind of obvious despite  the writers trying to twist you away from it. Overall, you won't have  much of an impression from this picture but it makes for a good time in  the cinema.  6.5/10",Happy Death Day
101,RforFilm,Happy Death Day feels like a great movie that was edited by cowards. Wish for a directors cut for your birthday,6,17 October 2017,"Groundhog Day had an arrogant man trapped in a small town on the same day until he learned to appreciate those around him. Edge of Tomorrow had Tom Cruise repeating an alien invasion until he could figure a way to win it. Today's movie has someone repeating not just their birthday, but the day that they are killed by a psychopath. I've mentioned before that on paper, time loop stories are a great way to get to know the person suffering the consequence of reliving the day. On camera, the trick is harder as the story has to remain consistent without being too repetitive. The idea of someone having to repeat their birthday is an interesting one, considering that the older one gets, the less they care about the day that celebrates that. It may be a morose notion, but it's about the college age in which people would rather draw attention on the celebration rather then the number factor. I myself celebrated my thirtieth by taking a vacation and having dinner with the family. The movie not only gives us a character who could care less that she has a birthday, but an extra layer that I wont give away. So Happy Death Day may have a little extra for the time loop story. A snobbish college girl Theresa (played by Jessica Rothe) wakes up in the dorm room of fellow student Carter (played by Israel Broussard). Though he tries to make small talk, she leaves to go back to her sorority. She spends the day being rude and pretentious to everyone including her roommate Lori. She's also the other girl in an affair with her professor and even ignores her fathers invitation to a birthday lunch. On her way to a party, she is stalked by a hooded figure wearing her school's mascot image as a mask. She is killedbut wakes up the same morningin the same dorm room of Carter.She initially dismisses the previous night as a dream and goes on her day againonly to get killed. When she realizes she's repeating the same day over and over, she's suggested to use that time to follow potential suspects. Each day ends in death and summons her back to the beginning, but the twist is that with each day, she is growing weaker from the injuries. So despite the safety of the time loop, there seems to be a clock that is getting closer to midnight as Theresa is trying to solve her murder.The whole time loop formula has been done before, but I like how Happy Death Day has used it in a horror context. Did it generate a scary movie? Well I'd say that while it's shot in a suspenseful tone, it doesn't generate that many scares. I'd argue that the tone is not even full horror, but I'll get to that in a moment. But going back to it's use on the time loop, I think they did it well. I also like that they establish that her body is still vulnerable to damage from the murders, otherwise it would seem like there were no consequence. I'll say that I really enjoyed Jessica Rothe in the lead. For someone who initially has to start the film in an unlikable manner, she carries the story and really makes you want to see her redeem herself. What the marketing seems to hide is that Happy Death Day is a part comedy. While I'm no sure why the trailers didn't want to spoil that notion, but I laughed more then I thought I was going. Because the film is still trying to be scary, it does suffer from inconsistency. I think it would have made sense to try and be a little more funny, something in the vein of Evil Dead or Drag Me to Hell. That would at least justify the PG-13 rating that is hindering this story of it's full potential. Those hoping for a lot of blood are not going to see it. I'll also bet that the film war originally produced with an R rating, only to get cut down to try and get in a teenage audience. Come on! Teenagers are already aware of these kinds of college dangers. They would have been fine with an R rating.I'll give this six red birthday candles out of ten. Happy Death Day feels like a great movie that was edited by cowards who thought they knew what was best. I doubt ill see this again as it is, but I'll be on the lookout for a directors cut. Maybe that'll add back in that extra violence and jokes that are apparently too much for the studio",Happy Death Day
102,swilliky,A comedic horror that fails to be funny or scary,3,18 October 2017,"Taking a popular trope and splashing it onto a teenage thrasher doesn't do much for this dull horror release. The strangely named Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is a shallow sorority girl who goes through her day selfishly blowing off others and insulting everyone she knows until she is murdered. She wakes up to find that she is repeating the same day over again but this takes a little longer than it should, especially since they advertised this film a lot and audiences are here for the conceit. She's murdered again and freaks out as she wakes up in the same position. No matter what she tries, she keeps getting murdered by a mysterious figure who wears the baby mascot mask. The murders are not very clever but the killer is very determined to take out Tree.Tree keeps waking up in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard), a guy she drunkenly went home with last night though he did not have sex with her. As she goes through repeated trauma, he turns from a total strange into a trusted ally that she asks for advice. He is skeptical each time the day resets but entertains the scenario and gives her advice of using her many lives to investigate who wants to kill her. She investigates the people who might hate her like the sorority leader Danielle (Rachel Matthews) but she rules them out right before she gets murder. The inevitable montage of repeated death plays out as she reduces the suspects. She was having an affair with her doctor professor Gregory Butler (Charles Atiken) but eliminates his wife Stephanie (Laura Clifton) as her murderer.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Happy Death Day

Who else is known for spending $3 to $5 million on a movie and getting back ten to twenty times the amount? He definitely has a magic touch. I WANT to be Jason Blum!That said, could I bring myself to fund a movie like ""Happy Death Day""? I'd hate to admit it, but if I knew I'd make $50M for my $5M investment, I guess I would. This flick was probably written by a college freshman for an audience aimed directly at his peers. The acting was so-so, the story made no sense, I've never seen a hospital so empty, all the characters were cliches, and did I say the story made no sense?Why'd I watch it knowing what I was getting myself into? Blumhouse has been a winner in my book. There stories are fairly basic - beginning, middle and end with a few twists thrown in for good measure. In other words, you know going in that it won't be a complete waste of time and it wouldn't dethrone ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" from any Top Ten movie lists.

Every time she wakes we see that she has suffered some injury relevant to the murder, and these accumulate over the passing days. Her urgent need is to slowly piece together the evidence in the course of each repeating day until she can determine who the killer is. Every morning her frustration grows but at least she slowly progresses towards knowing who the killer is. Every morning we see her realise that reliving the same day gives her the opportunity to slowly learn how to be a better person.

It's this type of self-awareness and humor that makes the film enjoyable to watch.

112,CANpatbuck3664,"Carried by a Breakout Lead Performance, Happy Death Day Utilizes a Familiar Premise to Deliver Lots of Fun",9,14 October 2017,"Every negative review for this movie is going to point out that this movie is built around a concept that we've seen before. Our protagonist is forced to live through the same day again and again. Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow (both excellent movies) made this idea popular and for some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that this isn't brand new gimmick. I don't have a problem if movies borrow from other movies, they just need to do it effectively and put a fresh spin on it. Happy Death Day certainly accomplishes that. At the beginning, the journey hits the first couple of familiar notes but when Tree starts to realize what's happening, that's when the movie shifts gears. They aren't afraid to play with Tree's tragic end day after day and the movie functions for whole periods as a straight comedy. Luckily, this movie is really funny when it wants to be. The writers know enough to play with certain genre clichés and there's a surprising amount of tongue-in-cheek humour here. The marketing for this is a little misleading, it makes this movie look like a traditional slasher movie when it really ends up being a mishmash of comedy, mystery and horrorOther than the living the same day plot point, Happy Death Day centres around the mystery of who Tree's killer is. The movie throws a bunch of obvious red herrings at you right off the bat and I was glad they took it a less obvious direction. I don't think they overplay their hand either, there are a couple of hints here and there but I think you'd have to be pretty perceptive to guess the twists and turns that Day's plot takes. If I had one complaint, there was a point where they looked like they were heading towards a very sentimental resolution that could have been corny. Its a case of me wanting that for these characters. They bypass that though and keep going and while I understand the decision, I might have preferred that wrap-up instead.Another turnoff for certain audience members might be Tree's personality as a character. She's a real b!#@% when we first meet her and I'm not exaggerating. The first time she meets her killer, I wasn't feeling sorry for her. But even when she's at her worst, she still has a certain charisma that you want to keep rooting for her. Writing characters that aren't perfect and are selfish that you want to follow is an art that so many horror movies get wrong. I liked how Tree grows (no pun intended) and by the end I really wanted her to find a happy ending somehow.I don't often get to really discover actors and actresses. Most of the movies I watch are pretty mainstream and by the time someone becomes a lead, you've probably heard about them from somewhere. I wasn't familiar with Jessica Rothe at all but she anchored this movie as Tree. This is a stand up and take notice kind of performance, she's multi-faceted in handling both the drama and the comedy in this movie. I hope this movie is just a stepping stone to bigger things for her and I think the last time I walked away from a movie so impressed with an actress I didn't know was Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street. Israel Broussard is easy to like as Carter, he's easy going enough that his character's relationship with Tree builds up organically. Rachel Matthews is funny as Danielle Bouseman, she's playing a very stereotypical character (stuck up sorority rich girl) but she nails it. Ruby Modine is sweet as Lori and Charles Aitken is appropriately slimy as Gregory Butler,I couldn't believe how charmed I was by this movie. I didn't plan on going to see this, it was a very spur of the moment thing and walking out of the theatre I was blown away. Happy Death Day isn't the best movie I've seen this year but its the biggest movie-going surprise of the year for me. It features a great turn from an up and coming actress, a good mystery, some well placed meta humour and a willingness to play within its central conceit. The marketing for this movie doesn't show how creative and fun it is and I would urge you to give this a shot. We've come off the summer blockbusters and we're still too early for the awards contenders so if you're looking for something to check out, Happy Death Day is an extremely fun hour and a half at the movies. Also, make sure to show up on time, there's a gag pulled with the opening credits that hints at what's to come.",Happy Death Day
113,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,4 February 2019,"The stage curtains open ...This movie is billed as a slasher film, and although it does have elements associated to a slasher horror movie, this plays out more like a black comedy. ""Happy Death Day"" turned out to be a nice surprise. Of the newer horror-esque movies that were released in the last few years, this one was my favorite.We watch as Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (played by Jessica Rothe) gets to experience the day of her birthday over and over again in an effort to discover who is killing her. She always starts out her day waking up in the same room, experiencing the same things and eventually is murdered - only to wake up the next morning in an apparent loop to live the day over again. Much like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"" (which is another favorite of mine), she is able to remember the events of the previous re-lived day and decides to try and end the loop by discovering who her killer is in the hopes that she can actually make it to the next day.I've only ever seen Jessica Rothe in two movies. This one and ""Forever My Girl"" and she has quickly become a favorite of mine. In fact, I am even considering watching ""La La Land"", a type of film I wouldn't normally watch, simply because she is in it. ""Happy Death Day"" moves along at a good pace, keeping you engaged and interested. The comedy is spot on with some genuinely funny moments. This is a slasher film, so of course, some of the acting is over-the-top but completely fits the story.This one is a recommend. Funny, smart, engaging, a solid addition to anyone's movie collection.

I would not watch if you expected a horror film as it's more of a thriller/gore than anything else.Few negatives: the acting from a couple of the smaller characters was quite wooden. And it slightly bothers me how there's no actual reason why this particular girl was chosen to be able to keep waking up again to find out who her killer was. I know it's not the main purpose of the movie I just like all things explained.But, overall it's a nice, easy watch, likeable main characters and a pretty good plot that involves a couple of twists and turns. 7/10 would recommend.",Happy Death Day

120,PyroSikTh,"Just a Good, Fun Time at the Movies",7,18 August 2020,"I did not like Groundhog Day. I know, sacrilegious of me as a movie fan. I found it overlong and after a while the timeloop concept got boring. In fact I tend to dislike time-loop concepts as a rule of thumb. Doesn't matter if it's a movie, a TV show, or a single episode, they all just mould into the same story in different skin. But every now and then someone comes up with a new idea to shake it up. I was quite keen for Palm Springs, but whoever owns Hulu these days decided not to release it internationally. So while I'm left here twiddling my thumbs wondering whether that'll ever leave the American continent, I instead decided to watch another time loop movie that's been sitting on the watchlist for a while, with the interesting twist of being a slasher flick!Happy Death Day follows Tree on her birthday as she wakes up in a stranger's dorm room, hungover, avoids her father's calls, and is murdered on her way to a surprise party by a killer in a baby mask. Time loop time! She wakes up back in that dorm room with her hangover. Happy Death Day goes through all the same tropes as every other time loop movie, including the initial confusion, the realisation of what's going on, a montage of her enjoying her consequence-free freedom, having to explain to friends her situation over and over again because they keep forgetting, and desperately trying to avoid her fate by leaving or trying to outsmart the killer. Of course eventually she's persuaded into trying to discover who her killer is thinking this will set her free from her time loop, and that takes up the majority of the movie's runtime.Tree is like every time loop protagonist at the beginning of their stories; selfish, narcissistic, and a complete a**hole. But, as with every time loop story, she becomes aware of her actions and how horrible a person she really is, and becomes better and more caring by the end. Thankfully Jessica Rothe is so effortlessly charming and lovable that it becomes very quick for us to become endeared by Tree. We never particularly see her progression from b*tch so genuinely nice person, but we do see a whole new side to her open up as the loops go on, and it's at least clear from the offset that she is nowhere near the biggest b*tch of the movie. This all makes her final confrontations with everyone in her lives; the sincere apologies, the petty revenges, the genuine care for her friends, all the more impactful. While the scene with her opening up and apologising to her father wasn't going to win anyone any awards, it was hard not to moved by it even just a little bit. And she's no damsel in distress either, taking matters into her owns hands and showing smarts and competence as well. Token horror female bimbo she is not.As previously hinted at, Jessica Rothe is a revelation. She didn't particularly blow me away on the grand stage of acting, and she maybe lacked a little subtlety in her emotions, but she managed to carry the movie effortlessly, and was a far cry from the soap opera quality of acting I was sort of expecting. She has buckets of charm that made it really easy to root for Tree, and important quality for a protagonist, and her emotional range, while not subtle, was definitely worthy of praise. Just the stark differences in her smiles spoke volumes not only of her performance here, but also of how far she's capable of going if given the right opportunities. While her fake smile, her genuine happy smile, and her smile through tears are all functionally the same, each of them were instantly recognisable as to their intent. Almost every one was infectious.Something else that really surprised me about this movie was how downright entertaining it was. Sure, it was maybe a little light on the horror without any kind of gore at all, and the scariest moments were all the most cliche horror can get, but the amount of humour in this movie caught me off guard. This is definitely more of a horror comedy than just a time loop horror movie. And again, a lot of that comes down to Rothe, her expressions, and her quippy improvisations.It's not a work of art, nor does it particularly break any new ground. While being a time loop slasher flick is new, it falls into the exact same pitfalls as both genres at once. The murderer often appears out of nowhere without plausible explanation, and there are so many leaps in logic they're not even worth counting (in all her loops, not once does it occur to her to try and take her murderer's mask off). But this isn't a movie that wants you to think too much. It wants you to switch off and get taken for a ride. There's twists and turns that only work if you don't spend the whole movie actually chasing the answer.I had a fun time watching Happy Death Day and I'm definitely intrigued in watching the sequel, especially considering it follows the same cast of characters. I'm sure it can be enjoyed picking every little detail apart and pointing out every inconsistency (something I definitely did every now and then while watching), but it's just meant to be a good, fun time at the movies. And at that it absolutely succeeds. Tension, laughter, surprises, and maybe a little bit of a tug on your heartstrings, driven by an obviously talented actress carrying the whole movie on her shoulders as if it was nothing. I give Happy Death Day an enjoyable 7/10.",Happy Death Day

124,ethanbresnett,Far from perfect but incredibly fun,8,31 March 2021,"Happy Death Day is one of those films that punches well above its weight, and is far greater than the sum of its parts.It blends comedy, horror (pretty light touch horror in truth), teen drama, and does so brilliantly in my opinion.They use the groundhog day repetition of the events to great effect, drawing out lots of comedic potential, but also using this to develop and explore the central character of Tree in interesting ways. There's some great dramatic and emotional moments and I found myself getting very invested with the character.If you are a horror fan I'd maybe temper your expectations a bit going into this film. There are a few moments of genuine suspense and a couple of jump scares, but I'd say the film leans away from horror and more towards the comedy side for the most part. I enjoyed that they went down this route, as since we know she is going to die each time there's only so much horror they can really inject.Overall a really fun film. It perhaps lacked decent supporting characters and was a bit cliche in parts, with occasionally clunky dialogue, but none of this stopped me having a great time with this film.A really enjoyable movie!",Happy Death Day

That's kind of dumb but also great - at least the movie is self-aware that it's ripping off another film.Secodly, I liked that there is They Live poster on a wall. And it even shows many times. This is the best part in the movie.Those are the good aspects. Everything else is bad. The plot is tedious and boring to follow, and it's unimaginative and copying GD riciculously. Especially the part where the main character starts to apologize and trying to be a better person. That works in GD but it makes no sense in this story and feels pretentious. This is a horror film about a murderer. Or is it? There's hardly any horror feel. Most of all it's just a teen drama with a creepy topic. And the mask the killer is wearing, that's so annoying to look at.I don't know if They Live poster deserves an extra star but that's maybe a bit strech because overall this is a movie that I found pretty much nothing good in it.",Happy Death Day

Of course, that was a bit of blatant misdirection. It had me thinking, ""What was the killer's motivation for, apparently, explicitly targetting Tree?"" The answer, of course, is that the true killer did have some sort of motive, though I'm not convinced it was strong enough. (I may be confused, but I understood there to have been two actual killers, spread across the various re-runs of Tree's Death Day.)Despite that twist at the end, this just didn't offer enough to make it worth watching. It was an interesting idea, but the script didn't provide any real depth to the characters or situations. I remember The Butterfly Effect (2004) being a much more thoughtful and enjoyable imagining of ""do overs"" and their consequences.",Happy Death Day

The catch? She must relive this same fate ever day until she can stop the seemingly omnipotent and omnipresent killer.Going into this film, I expected a low rent slasher with a silly premise that I could write of a garbage. Well it certainly wasn't that. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's a very fun Halloween movie. Don't go into it expecting the next big thing in terms of horror, go in expecting a fun comedy with horror elements and I think that you'll enjoy this movie very much.What can I say that I liked about this movie, specifically? Well the tone was excellent. At the start, very few of the jokes hit for me so I got a little bit worried. But as the film progressed, it became a genuinely good comedy. I tend to like Horror-Comedies because I don't like the feeling of being scared, and thus a joke or two helps calm me down. The way they blend the two genres in this movie is almost effortless. It definitely leans a little more onto the comedy aspect than horror, which will definitely turn off those who EXPECTED this to be a horror movie. It's maybe a 1/4 horror movie, 3/4 comedy? The creepy and jumpy moments worked, but they were infrequent. With the exception of ONE, jump scares were also non existent in this movie. Thank the lord God for that! But to be fair, the one that they DO use was pretty effective and worked well. So as a whole, the tone for this movie was pretty darn excellent.Another aspect of this movie that absolutely deserves praise, is Jessica Rothe's performance as a Tree. Sorry, the character's name is Tree; the character is unfortunately not a tree. She is, actually, far from it. Most horror movies just substitute in a stereotype of a character and expect that to work but this movie doesn't. She's the pretty girl but she's also the deluded, sociopath. Seriously! At the start of this movie, the character Tree is about as likable as the plant one. But Rothe portrayed this character undeniably well. Even in the latter half of the movie, she portrays the character exceptionally well and really sells the character's growth.Another actor who appears in this movie was Israel Broussard. Broussard also gives an excellent performance as Carter. Not only that, but I also REALLY buy the romance between Tree and Carter. It doesn't feel forced in the slightest and that is rare for a movie nowadays. It usually feels wrong when two characters get together in a movie because I just cannot see it happening in real life. But thankfully, I did buy their relationship, and found it to be a very fun and goofy one to watch. Alas, I do definitely have some flaws with this movie. The final 15 minutes and the grand reveal were my two main issues. I won't spoil either of course, so you can still enjoy this film. But personally, I found the final 15 minutes of this movie to be COMPLETELY unnecessary. So much so that I was getting ready to leave at the climax of the scene before that because I thought the film was over. But no. They drag it on an extra 15 minutes and reveal what I predicted to happen. Which was my second issue. I predicted the ending BUT only because I was paying REALLY close attention to a scene and, while it may have bee accidental, they reveal the ending by use of a prop. This may be just me being smart and interpreting it a weird way, or it may have been intentional, in which case then well done to those who were in charge of that. It was a very clever way to reveal it, and the people I saw this film with didn't catch on and I had to tell them about it afterwards. Despite that, I did figure it out so I can't really credit the reveal as being that good.Something that personally didn't bother me but will bother other people, is the fact that this is not a horror movie by definition. It has elements of horror movies, yes. But it is still technically a comedy movie, which is NOT what the trailers suggested at all. So I can completely understand if horror fans felt mislead, therefore I do think that they should've either completely changed the marketing campaign OR included a LOT more horror elements and creepy scenes. But aside from those flaws, I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. It isn't going to win any awards but I can see it gaining a cult following. It was certainly fun and entertaining and I will definitely recommend you go and see it. I'll rate 'Happy Death Day' 6 'Creepy Masks' out of 10!",Happy Death Day

I figured if I went in with the mindset that this would be just ok, I would enjoy it more. And I was right. I didn't like it enough to the point where I'm going to buy it on Bluray, but I'm glad I saw it. This shows why Jason Blum is one of the great modern day horror producers. This succeeded where ""Wish Upon"" failed. The main character starts out unlikable but gets better as the story goes on. ""Wish Upon"" didn't do that. The main character in that one stayed unlikable throughout the entire film. This had a good mystery element to it that kept me guessing. There's tons of suspects for who could be the killer, and they each have different motives. I kept changing my suspicions of who the killer was every 5 minutes. This had a good twist that I didn't see coming, and won't dare spoil, because it's just too well concealed. Another thing I need to praise is it didn't overdo it on the jumpscares or gore. All the deaths were off screen, and done tastefully. And it didn't rely on jumpscares, so much as ""There's something lurking in the shadows."" This is much more effective at bringing suspense. I wouldn't say go see it in the theaters, but it's worth a rent. Definetly worth checking out.

139,movieman6-413-929510,A horror slasher in a Groundhog Day style,5,13 February 2019,"Happy Death Day is a new horror mystery film directed by Christopher Landon, the director of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones and Scout Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.
The film is about the student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe). When she wakes up on her birthday in the bed of her fellow student Carter Davis (Israel Broussard) she tries to get through her day in her normal student way, but when she is followed in the evening and killed by someone with a baby mask, she revives she's her day again.
When the same thing happens again the next day, she learns that she is stuck in a timepiece and she is doomed to repeat this day until she can expose her killer and learn how to prevent her death.
This horror film is soon made by using a timepiece as a movie like Groundhog Day, but then in a horror jacket. Films with a time magnifier can be fun, but this is the third movie this year that uses a time magnifier in the story, after Before I fall and 2:22. If you've already seen one or both of these films this year, the use of another time magnifier in another movie can happen repeatedly. Luckily they know how to keep this film interesting for the public by using a masked killer. This way you as a viewer can try to guess who the perpetrator is. It is unfortunate that the perpetrator can easily be identified if you keep paying attention during the film. This way you can be ahead of the film and lose interest when they are behind the wrong suspect. If in the end the reason of the killer is made known, this reason can also be disappointing. The reason may seem somewhat faint and weak for some.
The film also becomes more comical rather than scary at one point. For example, the film for people who go to the cinema for a horror movie may be a bit disappointing. Furthermore, the film is more fun for a young teenagers of just over sixteen, because for older viewers the film in terms of horror a bit disappointing, because in the end it is more fun to laugh than the movie is really scary.
The cast of the film does consist of a group of beginning actors. Fortunately, most of them know how to communicate credibly that they are in a time-saver by repeating certain scenes in a credible way. Jessica Rothe does a good job as the lead actress in the film. It's nice to see how she adjusts her character during the film, to find out more about the identity of the killer.",Happy Death Day

141,WalkdenEntertainment,What If Groundhog Day Was A Horror Film...,6,10 January 2019,"A teenage girl, Tree (Jessica Rothe), wakes up in bed with a horrible hangover and can't remember the night before. Nor can she remember the man's name who is in the same room as her...Today is no normal day. Today is Tree's birthday and soon she will realise that this is her final day alive. With an unknown killer lurking around her college campus, Tree is murdered by the end of her day only to awaken the next morning right back where her Day started. Tree is forced to relive the day of her death over and over again, dying in a different way each time.Can she solve her own murder? Or perhaps make an improvement on her day by being a better person or finally deal with personal matters?While watching Happy Death Day it was challenging not to connect it to other films that were very similar. For example, Tree's character reminded me so much of the character actress ""Rachel Adams"" played in Mean Girls and Hot Chicks. Tree's character at the start of the film is a fun and cruel character. She is rude and insults anyone in her way. Plus, she toys with multiple male partners which also makes the list of possible killers rather large. As for the day repeating, itself well... we should all know what film that reminds me of. The consistent mystery and added horror element tries to make this film differ from others like it.While Happy Death Day did manage to add new elements to the film, it still falls into the traps of common jump scares and horror cliches. Sometimes these just don't work and take far too long to play out, taking up too much screen time. How the killer is discovered, or, should I say, how the film reveals the killer, is also not very believable. No matter where Tree ends up in her day, so does our mystery killer. What are the odds?Sure we have twists, turns and a killer is finally revealed, but for me, the outcome was a predictable one. As the film progresses, certain characters are never investigated and such strong hints are given to the audiences it almost feels like we are spoon feed. It can feel rather annoying when the audience knows who the killer is, but we still have to watch the lead character get continuously annoyed and frustrated each time she dies or realises she just wasted time following a wrong lead.Overall, while Happy Death Day brings elements from other movies, it does manage to bring new added elements such as adding the Horror genre to its story. The film's tone does feel more aimed at a ""teenage"" audience, but nevertheless, there's still some brainless popcorn fun to be had even if you do figure out the killer before our lead character does....6.1/10

145,darkreignn,A fun horror-comedy that doesn't skimp on character,7,17 November 2020,"The first time I saw this film was all the way back in 2017 - the good old days. I remember watching the trailer and preparing myself for something that seemed truly frightening; when I was at the theatre watching the film, however, it subverted my expectations in the best way. The other day I decided to give this movie a rewatch, and I found it even more enjoyable the second time around.""Happy Death Day"" is a horror comedy that focuses heavily on the comedy. Following a college student named Tree, played by the marvelous Jessica Rothe, ""Happy Death Day"" tells the all too familiar story about a masked killer who stalks his unsuspecting prey and stabs them to death. The catch? When Tree dies, she wakes up and experiences the same day all over again. Yes, it is exactly like Groundhog Day, but that's what makes this movie so much fun. More of an homage than a complete ripoff, this movie takes the premise and completely makes it its own.As I mentioned, this movies sense of humor is what makes it so endearing. By choosing to make this movie so lighthearted, you can really have fun with its concept and grow to love each character that it presents to you. And speaking of characters, ""Happy Death Day"" doesn't skimp on character development. Each of its main characters, and even some of its side characters, are so fully fleshed out that you'll pause the movie to make sure you're watching a Blumhouse production. The overall quality of the film is higher than you'd expect from a silly teen slasher flick, and you'll really start to care for Tree and the other characters she comes across. Furthermore, the strong character development really lends itself well to beautiful romance and touching scenes of drama and emotion that are all too rare in these types of movies.For you horror fans, the violence is here, but obviously neutered because of the PG-13 rating. However, there's still plenty of blood, stabbings, and creative offings that you've come to expect from a horror film. In my opinion, however, the lack of gore enhanced this movie and played along well with the overall lighthearted and fun tone the film took.""Happy Death Day"" is a movie you'll watch if you want to have fun. From its sweet character moments to its creative premise and laugh out loud set pieces, I guarantee you that a smile will be plastered on your face from beginning to end.",Happy Death Day
146,Aly200,Surprisingly Fun and Entertaining,7,18 January 2018,"Okay the premise sounds silly and a cheap mash-up of movies that have been done, but this silly movie actually has a fun factor that makes you enjoy watching this romp.Jessica Rothe plays college student Theresa 'Tree' Gelbman, a self-centered young woman who mistreats her roommate (Ruby Modine), sleeps around with her professor and any boy on campus and ignores her loving father when she is murdered on her birthday by a masked assailant. When she discovers that she is stuck in a time loop till her murderer is unmasked, Tree must enlist help from a fellow student, Carter, and find out who would do her ill. The cast of characters are a unique bunch of players. Rothe's Tree starts as a bratty, slutty and obnoxious lead whose death you kind of cheer for at the start. As the film progresses, Tree's sins soon force her to confront her past and unburden her loathsome behavior towards others. With each new chance to solve her death, Tree's persona slowly starts to change into a nicer human being than the girl we met at the start. Rothe even has great chemistry with her costars particularly Israel Broussard as Carter and Ruby Modine as Tree's roommate Lori. Israel Broussard as Carter is not the typical horror/teen movie love interest as Tree and Carter aren't even an item or getting along at the film's start. The chemistry between Carter and Tree builds as the film progresses since Carter is the sole person that Tree can trust within the narrative as she tries to solve her murder. The pair do eventually get together at the end, but the relationship is constructed pretty well. Then there's Ruby Modine as Lori, the studious and quiet roommate who Tree mistreats and mocks when she gets the chance. Tree even tosses a cupcake Lori makes for her and secretly ridiculing her lack of a boyfriend with the other sorority sisters. While Lori has limited screen-time, Modine makes the most of what time she does have as Lori tries to help Tree relax despite her unbelievable predicament. But even Lori may not be able to be trusted in the endless time loops.'Happy Death Day' has been predictably called ""Scream Meets Groundhog Day"" which is true, but there is a uniqueness to the concept. The movie has some traditional slasher elements with its masked killer and then the 'Groundhog Day' concept with the time loops. Yet the onscreen violence is not explicit like most slasher flicks as we never actually see Tree get killed (except for two sequences which are still fairly bloodless). The filmmakers even use good editing techniques to cut down some of the repetitive moments leading to Tree's eventual deaths. The film gets quite predictable plenty of the time because of the endless time loops, but there is always a new little twist thrown into the mix. When Tree makes her suspect list, the story gets a chance to explore the minor characters who could be Tree's killer and also why she doesn't get along with them. Each loop also gives Tree a chance to get her act together and improve her behavior which actually does happen when Tree begins to see her feelings for Carter, apologizes to Lori and makes peace with her estranged father. Even the killer's true identity is a surprise as it is the person who would seem obvious when you think about it, but just watch to see how our heroine could've missed the clue.",Happy Death Day

Happy Death Day reminded me of every single time-loop movies I watched like: Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, and Naked from Marlon Wayans. But this is a different kind of film that I would enjoy watching.",Happy Death Day

From the trailer, we know that this movie will be so interesting & we just watch it. I don't know what to say anymore, it's so good! Imagine a light sorority teen movie+slasher+g-day and it will be a total carnival. It's so fun you wish it never gonna end.

149,MonsterVision99,Pretty mediocre,5,6 November 2017,"Yet another teenage horror comedy, this one its much more lacking in the horror department than I was expecting it to be, it has a few decent suspenseful scenes and some slightly funny moments but its mostly just uninteresting, predictable, dull and obnoxious.This feels like a made for TV Lifetime movie that went to theaters, its kind of like ""Scream"" in many aspects they are both annoying, they are both dumb, and they are both rather decent when it comes to the actual horror scenes. The main lead is a brat, really unlikable, even when she gets done with her character arc she remains somewhat irritating, Bill Murray could get away with saying douchy lines and still being likable, he was known for that, we rooted for him in ""Groundhog Day"" because we wanted him to be a better person and to be happy, the girl in this movie is decent at delivering the lines but you never feel like she could be a nice person.While the comedy in movies like this its often hit or miss, I will say its mostly miss here by having characters say predictable lines or being exasperating just for the sake of it.The director is Christopher B. Landon, who wrote many ""Paranormal Activity"" movies and directed ""The Marked Ones"" after that he went into teenage horror comedies with ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"", looks like he couldn't make a decent horror movie so he decided to ""make fun of them"" with these awkward juvenile movies like ""Happy Death Day.""",Happy Death Day
150,FelipeCarrillo,"""Scary Movie"", ""Scream"" and Groundhog Day adopt a wicked baby mask",6,3 December 2017,"On this base idea is set up Blumhouse Productions' latest big hit, Jason Blum's production company has been crowned as the only studio to make a huge profit at the box office with low-budget medium-high quality films. Being its 13th flick with a respectable worldwide grossing, ""Happy Death Day"" must be considered, besides an extra proof of Blumhouse vigor and vitality, as a breath of fresh air for commercial slasher cinema, one to which, little to little, they bury it the stake further inside.The main disadvantage with the script doesn't lie in the combination of genres, otherwise, that's one of the most remarkable features of the film, the drawback is the way to tie up some loose ends, because, in fact, they are closed to so much pressure that coherence threads are abruptly detached. As a thriller, mystery whodunit, the interest of audience will be placed in the resolution of the homicide, consequently, if you want to carry the genre proudly, should manipulate the perceptions of each spectator in order to cast doubt before the more insignificant detail, here, although interesting bets are proposed in the course of the third act, the truth about who's behind the creepy mask is not a great thing at all. Inserting, unjustifiably, the subplot about a lurking criminal as a rough backdrop, inserting boring overcoming of family quarrels, inserting the stereotyped comings and goings in this kind of stories, the feature film ends up being a mildly lost opportunity, it could have formulated more surprising suspects and more intelligent endings for the unknowns, a little help: Carter. Another point, which cannot be part of the category of flaws due to the origin of its dubious purpose, concerns the absence of a clarification about temporal loops. As soon as they lay all the cards on the table, nothing more expect to conclude the game, give a coherent explication about day- restarting plot, however, there are no grounds for it, neither explicit nor implicit, simply, the idea is left up in the air, so that moviegoers produce their own clarifications, as always, a double-edged sword. Fortunately, the film keeps enough vigor, dynamic and strength in montage sets, performances and narrative circumstances that make it more than energetic, fascinating and entertaining the rebirth of our protagonist anti-heroine.As writer sets on the one side of the triumphant Blumhouse balance equation, on the other side, the director acts as a counterbalance. Although Christopher Landon's name seems Lilliputian compared with film-savvies as James Wan, M. Night Shyamalan, Oren Peli, Jordan Peele, Joel Edgerton, Scott Derrickson or Damien Chazelle; his most recent pic would be the first great milestone in his ascending career, even though he has a long, long way to enroll in the major leagues. Landon provides newness and daring for a film that could easily have fallen into muddy plots of aimless comedy, dysfunctional horror or soporific thriller; here, the filmmaker reveals his contemporary thinking by transmitting young-focused company MTV's ""Teen Mom"" on Tree's TV instead of any Hitchcock's or Coppola's classics; here, Landon places a female Bill Murray imprisoned in a college campus; drastic swaps that benefit the feel-good that radiates the ending of the film. Evaluating the work of the director through the final result, one could say that the man behind ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" has just gained a great improvement in terms of filmmaking and control is concerned, Every filmmaker who demonstrates a professional advancement deserves a heated ovation, however, taking into consideration Landon's labor, half of the continent must stand up and applaud him, congratulations, a future colleague.Uni and Blumhouse manage to deliver an entertaining contemporary story with honors, they can produce a five-star action thriller, abduction suspense one or murder-solving one, simply, shows off the aces up its sleeve and leap them, without clemency, on the face of the spectator. The particular montage, the nice pictures and the excellent score team up in a moderately phenomenal way, although, visually, they are restricted by the number of scenarios shown in the first twenty minutes, however, the lack of possibilities encourages productivity and originality that end up in magnificent films, in this case, it's testified through interesting camera movements, amazing angles, and very old-school approaches; the saying: creativity is the only weapon emerging from low-budget and narrative constraints is very true. The soundtrack deserves special mention, it seems to mock 80's horror flick, its stridency and apparent jocularity are mixed with the same functionality as the images, its melodies recall ""Scream"", and even, there are explicit scenes which lead to our memory, without any remedy, to Wes Craven's film; great job Bear McCreary, no doubt, the best aspect of the film.Christopher Landon's ""Happy Death Day"" positions itself on the throne of the horror and youthful-humored satire of the year, not merely because of its picturesque premise, but because of the appropriate levels of execution and narrative approach it presents. Although never taking itself too seriously, it serves as a fortifying incentive for the association between studios, verifying that they are on the right way, a path brimming with originality and magnetism that would not be defaced by low-budgets. Sadly, the film is left behind compared to its contenders, experimenting a sense of emptiness at the end of the showtime, shows that, at least narratively, has been a partially lost opportunity. Undoubtedly, Landon's film had the perfect tools to become huge, but with the result, it only got to be big. Let us blow out our candle of desires and we pray together for longevity and vitality of this alliance.",Happy Death Day
151,lorcan-61881,Halloween Review #23: Modern horrors picking up from found footage and crappy actors,9,24 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is the new horror film directed by Christopher Landon,who directed Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones as well as Scouts Guide To Zombie Apocalypse,two movies that got very poor reviews,that I really enjoyed,Scouts Guide is a hilarious one of the best comedy's ever as well as The Marked Ones being my third favorite in the PA series after three and one. When I heard about Happy Death Day coming to my cinema,I wasn't really excited in fact,even my sister who barely watches any movies didn't want to go see this,and she liked Ouija..ya,really. But,when I heard all the good reviews,I decided to watch it for you guys..and myself,just in case I really liked it. So when I watched the first half of the film,I was definitely hooked and then..Happy Death Day,somehow,became one of my favorite horror films ever! Look,I know Happy Death Day is nor original due to Groundhog Day and Before I Fall,but the way they did it was brilliant. The film has no dry lines and no bad writing,I can't find anything wrong with the film,it actually felt like the Scream series,like so much,there was also like a million endings and I was excited to see what would happen next. The acting in the film was also very good from some teens. Christopher Landon is a great director in horror to me,and I hope he keeps directing great films like these first three,although,some may disagree,which I can understand. Happy Death Day though..wow!",Happy Death Day
152,namob-43673,Relax and enjoy it for what it is,7,18 October 2019,"First of; this is not a good movie. It is a bit generic, a bit wobbly in sense that the movie does not really know what it want to be, it is very easy to spot plot holes, and the story is not always on point. The cinematography give you a feeling this is a B-movie and I am not sure how much thought process actually was put into making this.With this said however, this is pretty fun!I know I said above that the movie is a bit generic, and it is, but it also offers a few surprises and it is, at least within the horror-thriller-slasher-""comedy"" genre, pretty refreshing. Jessica Rothe is really great as the lead actress and although a few of the extras and side-characters do not do the greatest job (I blame the director) most of them offer a great performance. Best of all however, despite all the negatives you can find and despite what I have mention the movie is what it is and it does not take itself too seriously which make it a fun watch.If you watch this movie expecting a new The Shining or something of course you will be disappointed. If you however relax and enjoy it for what it is - sort of a middle-ground between ordinary slasher movies and spoof movies - then you will be happy you watched it. This is fun and a good way to spend some time.The score... well, as a movie I would hesitate to give this more than 5/10, but within its genre and as a fun unpretentious version of horror movies I will give this a 7/10. I highly recommend. Have fun!",Happy Death Day

154,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Happy Death Day!Happy Death Day!Happy Death...wait....,7,3 October 2018,"Even though the concept of time loop is not original (the film even tongue in cheek references Groundhog Day) I felt it was refreshing and original in this context. For the most part, I liked the film. Its not always straight horror. At its core its also a film about self discovery (much in the same way Groundhog Day was) and also maybe a little bit of a romantic comedy. Again, I like that it feels different from a lot of horror films out there. I also thought it worked as a decent mystery as you're trying to figure out the killer alongside Tree. That being said there was some things that didnt work for me/didnt make sense. At least in 2 of these timeloops, death is on her hands (I wont say in what context or with who) but we never see the police get involved. We see her later that day/evening with her love interest and everything seems hunky-dory. Realistically she would be arrested or at least being questioned by police. It just took me right out. Also I dont know why she didnt just get in a car and drive off somewhere a lot sooner. She always seemed to stay on campus. I get that it was probably due to the production budget, but from a story standpoint if you're trying to survive the night why wouldnt you just get in a car and drive somewhere random where nobody knows you're there. Don't talk to anyone about leaving....just go? I don't know. But I liked the cast and it was an interesting concept. The deaths are fun too and aren't too gory so if you're watching with someone who's not too big on horror, they might be ok with this.",Happy Death Day
155,Jared_Andrews,"It's Fantastic Fun for an Hour, Then it all Unravels",6,21 October 2017,"It's Groundhog Day, but with murder. What a wonderful premise.The main character, Tree (short for Teresa, she doesn't come from a hippie family with a brother named Root) wakes up with a massive hangover and a foggy recollection of the previous evening. She stumbles out of the dorm of some guy she doesn't remember from last night and heads back to her Sorority house before carrying on with a typical day in her life. We see very quickly that Tree does not treat people very well. Every passing interaction ends with her making the other person feel worse.That night she walks to what she doesn't yet realize is her surprise birthday party. On the way, she is startled by someone wearing a school mascot mask, which is a baby (no, seriously; the school's nickname is the babies). This baby mask wearing stranger gruesomely kills Tree.Then BOOM she wakes up in the same dorm to live the same day all over again because this movie is the birthday murder version of Groundhog Day. On this second time through her day, we watch a little more closely. We see every person as a suspect, every detail as a clue.Eventually she tells the dorm room guy, who is named Carter, about her whole day repetition murder nightmare. He suggests that she use her unlimited lives to figure out who her killer is, which she does with limited to zero success in sometimes hilarious and sometimes terrifying ways.At this point, we're about an hour into the movie and it is fantastic. It's sharp, moves at a brisk pace, and delivers an ideal balance of scares and laughs. Then everything begins to unravel.The plot endures an infuriating twist. All the interactions and details of her day now seem like a waste of time. I begin to wonder if any of what I watched was actually evidence that could lead us to the killer. What first appeared as the work of a master craftsperson now seems to be haphazard and meaningless filler between Tree's morning wakeup and nightly death.The ending attempts to clean up the mess, but the damage has been done. I'm left with a rather interesting question—how much can I like a movie that entertained me endlessly for first 2/3, but aggressively disappointed me in the final third? My answer: not very much. Like I said, the damage had been done. This wreckage could not be salvaged.On a lighter note, Jessica Rothe shines as Tree. She's believable in all facets, which is much more than can be said about the rest of the movie. Despite the misfire in execution of the final 30 minutes, I still love the premise. I would jump at the chance to see another Groundhog Day style movie.Ultimately, my grave mistake was thinking. If you see this movie, which I think I would actually lightly recommend, don't think about it too much and don't try to figure out who is Tree's killer. Just watch, scream, laugh and repeat.",Happy Death Day

159,RhapsodyReviews,Smart Comedic Horror Film.,7,30 September 2019,"Review:
'Happy Death Day' is an American black-comedy-slasher film directed by Christopher Landon. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie; I went in not expecting much and ending up having a great time. I loved the dark sense of humor this movie had; Christopher Landon really isn't a well-known director. He did Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse which I personally love, and I think this movie was a very well-done movie for what it was. I thought he did a great job working in humor with this movie and taking the 'Groundhog Day' experience, which has been over done in movies and made it feel fresh again.
It follows a college student (Jessica Rothe) who is murdered on her birthday and begins reliving the day repeatedly, at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death.
Now, nobody in this movie other than the main lead did a whole lot for me, but that's who you have your focus on. I loved Jessica Rothe in this movie. She is easily one of the best lead girls in a slasher flick, next to Neve Campbell (Scream). They make her very human and quite unlikeable, at the beginning, which felt very real for me. She grows and becomes a solid character through the movie and it's a nice arc for her character. It just felt realistic.
This does have horror movie tropes as a lot of horror films do. It makes up for it when the humor and originality it brings, and it brings them both. It starts out strong throwing us right into the story with intense scenes and suspenseful imaging. By the time the second act comes around you kind of get disappointed because it almost turns into a different kind of movie. It goes from a fun slasher flick to trying to big a jump scare horror. It comes back to what it started to be in the final act, which is good, but I wish it stuck to its guns and kept that feeling the whole way through.
Overall, this movie had a good plot that keeps you entertained throughout. You will watch this movie for Jessica Rothe, that is for sure. She was a powerhouse and threw herself into this character. I'm very excited to see the second one, and highly recommend this one.

This is an enjoyable Romantic Horror with more than a passing reference to GROUNDHOG DAY - and the occasional reminiscing of the 15 year old Shaun of the dead . Plus a bit of Scream , scary movie and a number of other slasher movies . Jessica Roshe was brilliant in the starring role , you believe in her character , her charm was endearing and despite the 10 years between her character and actual age she played the combination of innocent romantic with a touch a modern feisty independent female in control of her own destiny . The only poor point was how the inevitable twist was handled - that could have been slightly better but definitely worth seeing . Pad.A 7/10",Happy Death Day
161,Mivas_Greece,An interesting mix of timeloops (eg Groundhog day) and splatter (eg scream) in a highly entertaining movie! Ideal to watch with friends!,7,5 September 2021,"Youth movie / thriller / splatter with humorous element. The protagonist wakes up on her birthday after a hangover and by the end of the day, she is murdered. Then she wakes up again in the morning the same day as if she just saw a nightmare, only to repeat that nightmare in every detail until she is killed again and the day restarts. Only she remembers the day, everyone else is living the events for the first time. The only way to break the timeloop is to survive her assassination attempt or find out and stop her killer. The idea of a time loop is not new, in fact the film refers to Groundhog Day (1993), but clearly we have seen several more in the genre such as Batterfly Effect, Edge of Tomorrow, Palm Springs etc, but it is always interesting to watch. This particular film is mostly for young ages with several influences from Scream, but also doses of humor. It is not a serious film, but a fairly light film and its goal is clearly not to focus on thriller elements, but rather on mixing with humor to enhance the element of entertainment. It has enough bad language, so it is definitely not for the whole family, but to spend time with friends. For the purpose it came out it goes quite well in general, if it was more serious it would be even better.",Happy Death Day
162,KoolCatReviews,Ground hog day with a killer difference,5,4 April 2020,A some what intresting premise for a movie has a few tricks and twists. It's not scary it's more just fun. Not a slasher or thriller more of a who's done it. With the audience being asked to put ideas together. The main killer design is poor and has been done before to better effect. Some ideas within the movie are intresting. The actors do an okay job with story holding it together well.,Happy Death Day
163,FKDZ,Allround great watch.,7,9 October 2020,"Going into this movie I was expecting a bit more horror / slasher vibes but honestly this movie has very little of that, I'd argue zero horror. It's basically groundhog day but there's a killer instead that solves the loop. That said its engaging and in general just fun.Honestly this movie is really solid in general, the performances are really good, if anything this movie does well it's the actors and their writing. The lead actress is fantastic with how she develops overtime and it's fun to see her range over the entire run of the movie. The side characters are in general really funny and/or likeable.The directing is also pretty good here, with some awesome shots and creative elements like the baseball bat to bed scene. That said it felt lacking in creating true suspense. Multiple times this movie tries to build suspense because the killer is around but it's very predictable and somewhat overplayed. Also the movie did slow down a bit during the second loop in which not much happens. After that it picks up again.Now I think the most important part of this movie is how it ends, especially with these ''break the loop'' kinda movies it's important because the movie is constantly building up to that. So the ending kind of reveals this really is just a slasher but with some cheeky references, like a loop where she is making amends and being super positive like groundhog day, but it doesn't end up working. Her nurse roommate was the real killer and killing her was the solution, and that's that. So the loop being based not on her interpersonal development like groundhog day but just based because her roommate is out to kill her for stealing her crush is kinda meh.Now if I'd had to describe this movie it'd be a thriller comedy. The kills are not gory at all, there's just very little blood in general and all the kills are very much clean and simple. So for someone who sees this with a horror tag.. I disagree.Now the time loop is used okay-ish, groundhog day still stands above but here it really is used as a element, and not the core.That said it's a really fun movie with very enjoyable performances so definitely not something I regret watching. 7/10",Happy Death Day

We get to watch the main character get butchered a whole bunch of times in a bunch of different ways by a masked psycho all while trying to solve the mystery of whom is doing it. It's perfect really. The film definitely has its fun with this too, and has a game performance from the lead actress Jessica Rothe.Unfortunately it's a bit of a neutered affair, what with the PG-13 rating and fairly rote storytelling mechanics. Death scenes are less Final Destination levels of fun - where the surprise is how she will die while trying to avoid death - and more stalk and slash and quick cut away from any good gore. The plot has a twist, and it's not bad, but there were a lot of areas where the film could have become even twistier. It also could have laid off the moralizing about becoming a better woman stuff a bit - this is slasher Groundhog Day, not actually the real thing. We already have that.",Happy Death Day

In this regard Happy Death Day resembles Groundhog Day, but the mystery of masked killers with knives and jump scares resembles every slasher movie you've ever seen (minus the cliché of gory blood).The bottom line is that this movie is scary enough not to be ridiculous but funny enough to laugh at how the character deals with reliving the same day over and over again.

The twist that the main character's roommate was trying to kill her was quite predictable.Jessica Rothe gives a great performance as the main protagonist Tree Gelbman. Her performance is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this movie. The humour sprinkled throughout the movie was fitting and not at all contrived.To conclude, this was quite a generic and bland movie that was of course enjoyable, but it could have been much better.",Happy Death Day
173,hjalsayegh,Really good,9,31 October 2017,"I thought this was just a cheap slasher movie version of groundhog day. Oddly enough it was. Girl wakes up in a dorm room goes about her day then gets murdered before the day ends just to repeat the day again and again with her murder hiding they're identity behind a mask. Here is the surprise though. This movie is actually good! The girl is the stereotypical bitchy (or witchy if they've censored the movie like they did over here) cheerleader. Pretty much every single person in her life has a reason to want her dead. This works as you go through the list of suspects (sometimes hilariously) and don't feel bad seeing her die over and over. It more then earns the big reveal in the end and I found it to be a fun light hearted popcorn movie for Halloween. This movie got one extra point for being bold enough to actually straight up say ""hey, you know what your story reminds me off? Groundhog day, that movie with Bill Murray."" right at the end before the closing credits.",Happy Death Day
174,bushtony,Happy enough...,7,31 October 2017,"Although the core narrative is not original by any stretch, there are good reasons for liking this lightweight foray into the slasher genre. There are some original elements incorporated into the hoary old Groundhog Day chestnut – just enough dusting and polishing to make you forgive the pillaging. It doesn't aim for the same conceptual depth of, say, Timecrimes (2007), Triangle (2009), The Butterfly Effect (2004) or Edge of Tomorrow (2014) but it does manage to incorporate a nifty murder mystery thread into the time-loop motif and the execution feels a deal fresher than it probably should. Bratty, morally challenged and egocentric frat girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) finds herself living her birthday over and over again, each day ending with her murder at the hands of a masked stalker. All she has to do is find out the identity of her killer and avoid being killed in order to break the cycle. The film is not hard core or extreme in any sense that might apply to the bulk of modern slasher flicks. There are no real scares, there is no excess of blood and guts, no explicit violence, no torture porn or gratuitous sexual activity or nudity. So what does it have going for it? It's engaging, mildly funny in places and generally quite likable. Jessica Rothe is winningly cute in the lead. And not in a painfully forced or superficial way. Her gradual transition from selfish and self-absorbed sorority bitch to a more enlightened and humane persona is skilfully handled. You start out thinking she pretty much deserves her fate and then end up rooting for her to succeed. Rothe plays it just right and you can't help liking her. She is one of the most rounded and sympathetic female leads in a slasher movie since Jamie Lee Curtis in Carpenter's original Halloween (1978). In fairness, most of the cast deliver in terms of injecting some level of believability and personality into their rather clichéd stock characters. HDD deserves credit for some stylish camera-work and editing – both of which are tight, smart and in some places strikingly unusual. The key emphasis is on taking a well-worn concept, playing around with it and having fun. And that's what you've got here, a fun genre piece that doesn't take itself seriously and entertains for the running time. Unlike Scream it doesn't lose itself in self-reverential satire and admiration for it's own cleverness in ragging on genre tropes, and is all the better for it. It doesn't do anything ground-breaking or jolting, won't set the world on fire, and anyone expecting a visceral thrill-ride is more than likely to feel short-changed. But, I found it enjoyable enough, even though I'm far removed – very far removed – from its target audience. And I must add that I was wrong-footed by the ending, fully expecting the stock horror movie twist which isn't really a twist anymore – the one where you think everything's OK but suddenly evil triumphs. The twist this time around was a bit different to what I'd resigned myself to. And Groundhog Day does get a belated name check. So all in all, not bad, just about happy enough.",Happy Death Day
175,justinwfirestone,More fun than you might think,7,12 October 2017,"Happy Death Day answers the hard-hitting questions Groundhog Day was too afraid to ask. What if you were trapped in a diurnal murder- fest? Why not name a college the Bayfield Babies? What is up with Teen Mom?Director Christopher Landon, perhaps mostly known for being the screenwriter of Disturbia, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3, Paranormal Activity 4, and Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, has achieved something strange with Happy Death Day. It rehashes the gimmick of Groundhog Day as an introspective commentary on snobbery, apathy, vanity, and almost sympathy. It also throws in a psychological whodunit with only a couple of unsatisfying twists, some decent laughs, and surprisingly good acting from a star- bedazzled-less cast of B- and C-listers, all of whom have a sense of self-awareness that this is not a great movie, but at least they had fun along the way.I kept wondering, though, why not buy a gun? Why not leave town? Why not spend all night on the floor of a casino, where you will be surrounded by amped-up gamblers making murder more unlikely?If you were stuck on a deserted island and had to watch only one movie, every day for eternity, would you prefer Groundhog Day or Happy Death Day?

Every instance of her murder brings with it new thrills and new revelation and every time you feel as if you will end up dying with her. Its length is merely 97 minutes but it engages you so much as a viewer that you end up getting the feeling of having watched a four-hour long film.There must be flaws in this film, I doubt not, but I'll be amazed if people managed to find faults in a film that runs at such a relentless pace. I was so awestruck by it that I couldn't.It brings its lessons too. It makes her realise the fault in her actions (such as the affair with a married man), the sacrificial love of Carter who trusted and helped her each time she asked of him, her harsh stance towards her father and all in all makes her realise the value of life and being grateful - although just when you thought so, it still doesn't solve her problem, and in that lies the beauty of this film.Not to mention its biggest quality though, which is the way the thrills are wrapped in comedy.

186,trnjamesbond,Pathetic Horror Version Of Groundhog Day,1,28 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is one of the worst horror films of 2017. The cast is highly irritating, and just forgettable. Tree Gelbman yes you read that right, the main character is named Tree, played by Jessica Rothe. Her character is nothing that I even care for, just an ignorant girl from a rich family acting like she is better than anyone around her, her sorority sisters are just as pathetic. So here we sit watching some over privileged character walk through the steps of a ""Groundhog Day"" style film, living her death over and over again, which was portrayed in the trailer. Scott Lobdell was the writer for this terrible film, and in my opinion highly plagiarized from Groundhog Day, except this hack of a writer will not be sued because the story was tweaked enough and he turned it into a horror slasher style film, instead of a comedy. If people want to pay money to see such drivel then by all means, go right ahead. There is no likable character, I wanted them all to die, and there is no point to see this film unless it's something to fall asleep to. That's it folks move along now nothing to see here. 6.7 is a fake rating made by this fake website and fake people. This is a big old zero people. Avoid at all costs.",Happy Death Day

188,GavWaskett,"Phil Connors: Well, what if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today.",8,13 September 2020,"This was a random watch on Film 4 the other night which led to us seeking out the second film. A really intelligent, well-written, twisty turny, funny horror film, acted out by a whole set of really likeable actresses and actors who play their parts superbly.It's described as Groundhog Day meets Scream and I think that fits it perfectly but then add in a bit of Back to the Future and Event Horizon and you've got it.Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman is a bit of a cow, sleeping with her married professor, annoying her roommate, being part of a sorority that is run by your typical b@tches, ignoring her Dad's call on her birthday, waking up in a poor classmates room - Carter - hungover and not caring about him, she's your typical American College student baddy - the type of character you know is going to die horribly in a horror movie and so on the night of her birthday, she gets murdered by a figure wearing a babies mask(indecently the mask of the school mascot).All very standard fair so far, but then Tree wakes up in Carter's room at the same time, with the same music playing and he is leaning under his desk, just as he was the day before, oh yeah and it's her birthday again!Thus follows a very funny and at times very jumpy trip through Tree's many lives as he tries to work out who is killing her over and over again and at the same time learns about bit about how to be a decent person. There are numerous twists and these atypically aren't signposted and often come as a complete surprise.I'm really hoping that there's a third film, this is a story that deserves to be continued and these young actors deserve great careers.

I noted 'spoiler' in the caption out of an abundance of caution, but my 'spoiler' is simply to note that there is surprisingly little overt violence in the movie - the heroine always blacks out at the moment before her death. What does happen, however, is the GroundHog Day formula, which is not so much about the repetitive days, as the transformation of the character - in this case, from a petulant, spoiled sorority girl into a decent, rather likable human being. She discovers her true love (the audience likes him from scene one), sees through the vapidity of her sorority sisters, and re-establishes a connection with her widower father. Not bad.Add to that a few plot twists that are logical and not all that predictable, and you have a fun two hours in the theatre. Not all that common these days.",Happy Death Day

193,eparazak,"In general, it is a very mixed bag",6,16 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is a movie about a university student who, on her birthday, manages to get killed by an unknown masked person. After the experience, she wakes up and realizes that she is reliving said day. While she is repeating this process, she decides to begin tracking down the person who is repeatedly slaughtering her.Now going into this movie I didn't really expect that much. A horror movie such as this one simply looked like one where jumpscares would be very common. To an extent, I was right; there were a lot of jumpscares in this film and only a couple were effective. The first one, for instance was effective because you couldn't see it coming, but they stopped being effective directly afterwards because I had an idea where the plot was going to go with every repeated day. In a way, the movie fails at being a horror due to its predictability. This movie also has some major plot holes that I would discuss, but that would dive into spoiler territory.As for the stuff that I enjoyed in the film, it does get entertaining sometimes and many of the jokes were pretty funny. The relationships between the main character, the love interest and the dad eventually began to grow on me. If there's one thing that the movie somewhat succeeds in as a horror, it's the fact that it does deal with some of the repercussions of fear and what it can do to one's body and that's kind of scary when you think about it.Overall I really did enjoy this movie when it felt more like a dramedy. However, when it turns back into a horror film, for the most part Happy Death Day turns into an ineffective horror movie that is intended on using predictable jumpscares as a means to scare people, leaving that aspect of the films very weak.6/10",Happy Death Day

Don't get me wrong ""Happy Death Day"" was a rather enjoyable film, you just can't help but think how uninspired Hollywood are becoming churning out yet another teen slasher and another reliving the same day over and over again film/plot. But for what it's worth this film actually worked, and the suspense was always there with the allure of who the baby-masked killer was and if she stops her murder from taking place, will it end the cycle of waking up on the same day over and over again, on her birthday no less. One of the high notes of ""Happy Death Day"" for me was the ending, or should I say the false ending, all is not as it seems and indeed there's more to the tale, where the false ending was predictable and poor, the real ending was a genuinely nice surprise, giving a tired old formula an extra lease of life, shall we say? The whole premise screamed modern day and young adult, and that's absolutely fine considering that that's the target audience; as well as the main subject of the film, the film also acted as a catalyst for showing the world a brief glimpse into modern college life.The acting was okay, nothing brilliant but certainly not poor, basically the standard you expect from a younger cast of actors..., but did they look sincere or could you tell that they were acting? Thing is a lot of younger talent these days always look a little wooden, so don't let that put you off.

199,RetroRick,"deja review? No, fresh and finely executed.",9,27 January 2018,"Given its current rating - 6.5 at the time of writing - , it's identity as a college slasher flick, and notwithstanding the genre transplant, it's fundamentally derivative nature in its reworking of groundhog day, I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did.I can think of at least one other film based loosely based on ground hog day (I'm sure there have been many since even that I believe was based on the Ouspensky story ""a strange day in the life of Ivan Osokin"", and of course has even older origins in the myth of Sisyphus / cyclical ideas of history / psychological theories of arrested development etc. The film I'm thinking of, the name of which escapes me, but came out only a few years back, was written as a horror rather than a who-dunnit as I recall, but the one thing I do recall about it was after a while I began really did start to feel as existentially depressed as the nature of the experience might itself might predict. In other words, as the story itself suggests, the relief from monotony, repetition and ultimately deja vu, depends on the freshness of execution, deftness, and not just the idea, or splicing of ideas in this case, itself. Happy Death Day, despite the corny title, actually executes its ideas quite brilliantly, and there was never a time I was actually bored or felt as though the scenes in the film were literally repeating.I've given it a generous rating because I genuinely found myself concerned about the character - Jessica Roth's Tree, and - unlike some other reviews I'm afraid, failing to predict where the film would go. There are some predictable elements, like the Bill Murray like character progression, but these complement the story, and oddly serve to lull the viewer into a false sense of security.I won't go overboard. This isn't the best mystery, or who-dunnit, you've seen. The solution seemed pretty good to me, but clearly not everyone felt that way, but in the end it works really well, and in my view largely manages to transcend its genre. B++",Happy Death Day

Surely that isn't part of a normal college backdrop.Why is the protagonist surprised to find herself late for the class? She checks her watch when she wakes up, and she knows it's after 9am. Why would she be surprised to find it is 9:20 a few minutes later?Why do dozens of people come to her surprise party? Is she really that popular? She acts like a outsider and describes herself as a ""bad person"". It's hard to believe that she has that many friends.Why is her lecturer apparently teaching chemistry, yet also acts as a college doctor and apparently runs x-rays and other scans on the protagonist?These and other flaws in the backdrop make it hard to believe Tree is living in a regular world. These flaws are quite jarring and tend to derail the (very ambitious) concept of the recurring day.Despite the flaws this is still a super fun movie.The lead is in every scene and does an amazing job.

It starts of quite seriously and looks like it is taking the direction of a typical on college campus slasher. After a while it takes a nice turn and becomes much lighter and that is when some of the comedy elements kick in. It also had a few twists which was a nice surprise. You are not going to avoid any clichés by watching it since it has them all, good looking bitchy sorority girls, a handsome college professor with an English accent and a good-hearted shy kid.One thing I could not get out of my mind while watching it is how similar to Before I Fall it is.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this actually was. The two main characters Tree and Carter had perfect chemistry on-screen and Tree was unlike the typical sorority girl in horror movies (or any sorority movie for that matter) which was a great addition to it's already great story line. I actually had hope that her character would solve it and make it out alive - saying she was badass is an understatement!The movie does great at keeping you drawn in and constantly rethinking of who the killer might be with all the curveballs thrown in there. When the true killer was revealed, it was definitely unexpected and not hinted at once during the entire movie - that I caught onto anyways.This movie is a great mix of slasher-horror, mystery and comedy all in one and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great, fun movie.

There is no reason to delve deeply into the analyzation of this film because many of the ideas have been done many times.But the only reason I gave it a 6 is because the cheesiness and campiness of the middle part of the movie where it almost changed moods immediately and turned me off a bit and the ending left a sour taste in my mouth a little bit.

She will undoubtedly get plenty of work after this star-making moment in her filmography. Her performance happily reminds me there are tons of hungry actors out there--just give them a chance to shine, in any genre, and they will. Here's why I ended up giving it ten out of ten stars: I love comedies, and have been struggling to find good ones to support in the multiplexes lately. When this turned out to be one of the funniest films I'd seen in ages, one that had me laughing out loud often, especially when I was expecting a mostly horror- oriented film, I have to give it high praise. Comedy is tough, and this film succeeds completely in balancing the horror and comedy elements. Just one example: there is a roughly ten-minute scene near the climax that had me laughing out loud continuously, and I couldn't be more grateful. A warning about the trailer for the film I had seen prior to the film's opening--it was so awful, making the film look so much like a quick, unimaginative money-grab for the horror genre crowd, that I almost skipped the film based solely on the trailer.

It just might be.And here's yet another variation of it: HAPPY DEATH DAY.It isn't awful, as carbon copies go, but it takes major cajones to rip off an entire plotline (and even individual scenes, for God's sakes!) so brazenly. But these folks did it.And to those who insist, ""Everything's been done before!"" ... nope, sorry, that just isn't true. That's just something uncreative people say to themselves to justify their stealing. And to prove my point, show me an example of GROUNDHOG DAY that was done before GROUNDHOG DAY. Good luck.This movie does have a good surprise ending, though - one that was set up fairly cleverly at the beginning, and throughout the film. So credit where it's due.But the first 90 minutes or so are GROUNDHOG DAY.",Happy Death Day

212,Chiller7,This all depends on Jessica Rothe and she is quite good,10,9 December 2017,"This is a self-aware comedy-thriller that has fun with its time-repeating premise, slasher-thriller tropes, and exaggerated college-life stereotypes. And it even has a surprising amount of heart, with its story of a bad girl gradually learning to be good and appreciating the right people.Jessica Rothe is in every scene of this movie from beginning to end, so this movie's quality and entertainment value depend entirely on her and her performance. Thankfully, she's quite good at it. Here, she gets to showcase a whole range of acting ability, showing us she can do comedy, show off fear/terror, act like an unlikable biotch (to use the movie's own terminology) and then make us like her again, and even evoke sympathy in dramatic emotional scenes. I've been unfamiliar with her until now, but I'd say don't be surprised if we start seeing her name in more high profile stuff after this.As for the plot, it mostly handles it pretty cleverly. Aside from the most obvious logical hole that the movie ignores (why doesn't she just leave town?), our main character mostly handles her situation in a logical and clever way in all the different things she tries from day to day and she never does anything too stupid. The movie has a lot of fun with this, making sure she has many wildly different experiences each time the day repeats.I do have to complain about one thing that the movie does with its time-repeating premise that seems to be oblivious to its own rules. Our main character is seen making a list with names of possible suspects and one by one, she marks out the names when she finds out they aren't the murderer. But this happens over multiple days, so why is the same list from previous days still carrying over to subsequent days? Unless she's rewriting the same list with the same names and marking them out every day, that doesn't make sense.I walked in expecting a trashy movie, with gratuitous sex/nudity and gory violence. But it turned out to be a lot tamer, teenager-friendly, in those aspects. That's my mistake, because I didn't even check the rating to realize that this was merely rated PG-13, not R-rated. I wonder if the movie could have benefited from an R-rating. The violence for instance featured very limited blood for so many stabbings. The worst things that happen happen off screen. I'm sure the tension would have been greater and fear more for the characters if we got to see some horrifying murder scenes, instead of just seeing screaming and then cutting away right before the bad stuff happen, which is how this movie handles it. But then again, the overall tone of the movie is more fun comedy than horror, so I guess you can also argue they did it the right way.",Happy Death Day
213,pedroquintaoo,Almost was a refresh in the slasher sub-genre,6,12 October 2017,"Since Happy Death Day was announced, seemed to be a mix between Scream (1996) and Groundhog Day (1993), a story about a sorority girl getting killed and needing to repeat her day again, again and again was a really nice concept. However my expectations went low when the movie was rated PG-13. I mean how is possible to do a good slasher without blood and violence?This movie has a good plot, the characters are really nice, I was interested in all of them and trying to guess who was the killer since the movie started. Sometimes tries to break the usual horror movie clichés and that's amazing. There are a lot of funny moments (some jokes are a little naughty for a PG-13 film, but still great). In my opinion the biggest problem is the lack of violence because some death scenes would be so amazing and funnier if the producers decided to add some blood and gore (like some Final Destination's deaths), however the worst problem is when Happy Death Day tries too hard to be different and surprise the viewer with some revelations that don't make sense.SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT That's one of the worst plot twists I've seen in a horror movie. Near of the 3rd act, Tree Gelbman figures out the killer is a random serial killer that just likes to kill young girls, it doesn't make sense, because how it's possible that guy know some secrets about the protagonist? Then we figure out the real killer is just an annoying girl from the sorority, she used the serial killer to put an ending in Tree's life. When the main character asks why she's doing this the villain just gives an explanation like ""you have an affair with the guy that I love"". For me that was awful and really confusing in someway.I would prefer a plot twist where we had 2 killers working together, Tree figuring out his identity, surviving and thinking that wouldn't die and repeat the same day again, but she's surprised by another killer and figures out there are 2 killers and not just one. They could be just 2 ""friends"" of her giving the explanation they hated her in due of the bad things she used to do to everybody. ENDING OF THE SPOILERS - ENDING OF THE SPOILERS - ENDING OF THE SPOILERSHappy Death Day tries to be different and it's in someway, however is also a victim of its own mistakes as the PG- 13 rating and the confused and weak plot twist.

I think the funnest part of the film was evaluating who had on dentures or not. AND it seemed like there were quite a few stars who had had them. obviously these party animals enamel had been damaged and we were left as an audience to guess how the happy ending might end up. don't get me wrong, there are some twists within the film.incompetent hospital staff etcetera. jokes? no no..not many. babes? no no..and the brunette ? well, she seemed to be about 150 pounds and maybe 5 ft 6inches tall....overall it kinda had a HEATHERS like vibe to it....but whether or not the boy the girl repeatedly ends up starting her day over again with is actually that one guy in Dunkirk remains to be investigated....youde have to look up the cast of both films to see if they match up.",Happy Death Day

She tries to go to a party that night where she is killed by a masked assailant; afterward, she wakes up again in the shy kid's room with only a vague recollection of what happened. As time goes on, and she dies again and again, she comes to one realization -- she must find out who her killer is to break the loop.The best parts of this movie come from where she believes she must become a ""better person"" to break the loop. Other than that, I'm not giving away WHO the killer truly is, but it will make sense when you find out.This movie was much better than what I had thought from the trailers...definitely worth a DVD rental.",Happy Death Day

I would have given this movie a 5 if it was just another generic brainless slasher film that I got dragged into seeing, but I rated it lower because I had to. This movie tried so hard to be clever, funny, edgy, and all the things that a horror movie really shouldn't be unless it's making fun of other horror movies (Cabin in the Woods).

After that she wakes up and relieves the same day over and over again, just like in ""Groundhog Day"", which of course was referenced in the movie, in a disappointing way to me with the main character not knowing what movie that was. 
The director left very subtle clues on who the killer might be and someone with an eye for horror/mystery films might catch on pretty early in the game.Some parts were funny, some parts were goofy and let's face it, it's pretty hard to make a good teen horror movie these days. 
The ending seems a bit carried away on how it was approached, missing small details, but if it's a comedic approach the movie was going for then it's fine.""Happy Death Day"" is a great addition to the slasher genre and to the time loop genre, being one of the best horrors of that year.",Happy Death Day

221,mistela67,Surprisingly Good,7,23 November 2017,"I've seen many, many slasher/thriller movies, and I thought this was going to be your standard fair. Although it was, sort of, the quality of this movie was much better than what I'm used to.First, writing and directing was top notch. Most slashers have very predictable story lines, and the directing is average to subpar. This movie had a very nice storyline. It wasn't original, but it did offer an interesting twist on a known plot line. The movie even makes a late reference to Ground Hog Day (from which the plot was based). But the way they used that plot to incorporate the slasher theme was intriguing. No, they don't explain why what happens keeps happening, and I think they missed a great opportunity there. But still, it's a well-written script with some very funny parts, and quality directing and editing that drives an entertaining vision.Second, the acting. The lead actress carries this movie. She was able to go from being a true bitch, to a true victim, to very funny, to really sweet. Even a bit intimidating at points. To be able to carry this off, as an actor, shows a great deal of training and natural ability for the art of acting. I hope this actress is rewarded with more movies because she's a talent.Third, the pace of the movie is on target. Not too slow, not too fast. Good editing is an often under-appreciated talent for the general movie goer. I can say that this movie works because of how it is put together. Even the twist at the end fooled me, and these sort of slasher movies NEVER fool me. Good job.I do recommend this movie. It will make you laugh at times, and it's refreshing that the violence and gore isn't overdone. But more than anything else, I recommend this movie because it's very entertaining, has good writing, directing, and a very good performance by the lead actress.7/10",Happy Death Day
222,thirtyfivestories,Narcissism is a Death Warrant,2,16 October 2017,"A poisonous sorority has inundated Bayford University with bitter rivals. A calorie cutting agenda cuts the crop of wishful debutantes, while 3 a.m. pledge inductions bloat testosterone and deplete respect. A mire of social cannibalism, the school common reeks of misappropriated ambitions.Tree, a sisterhood loyal, wakes in a pseudo-nerd's dorm room from a painfully obvious and contradicting ring tone. The three letter word illuminating from her screen elicits audible disdain. The seeds of selfishness are planted as she bosses around the servant boy who never deserved to care for her.Karma should never be laughed at, but here it is a tone-deaf joke. Tree has ample opportunities to correct her putrid elitism, but even death needs a few semesters' worth of lectures to make a dent in her obnoxious personality. With protagonist that even the most condescending individual would despise, the narrative throws all stakes in a fiery garbage bin where its victimizing one liners should have rested.When a film's universe is intrinsically tethered to time, it becomes inexcusable to disregard time frames entirely. The viewer becomes punished when they dive into the intricacies of the events that the film subjugates upon the audience repeatedly. No matter how long Tree stalls in waking moments, or how swiftly she jets out of the stranger's door, a timer starts when it is most convenient for the pitiful visual gags to wear themselves out.A heavy handed score mixed with the most ""paper due at midnight"" twist push this narrative into new depths of apathetic storytelling.

231,anthonymichaelbangert,Groundhog's Day and Scream,8,22 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is a modern slasher film directed by Christopher Landon. The movie follows Tree (Jessica Rothe), a young sorority girl with a ridiculous name, on her birthday. She is a bitch to everyone she sees. Before the end of the night, she is murdered by a person in a baby mask. Then she wakes up on her birthday again. Tree must learn who her killer is as she keeps living the same day, before her chances run out. To start with the obvious: yes, this film is very much like Groundhog's day in its premise. It is a person who is stuck in a time loop which they are trying to find their way out of. However, the film knows what it is, and doesn't try to hide from it. This leads to some tongue-in-cheek humor and a certain self-awareness not unlike the Scream films. Still, the story is fun and leads to some creative plot points mixed with clichéd ones. There are a few unexpected twists, and the mystery is fun to try to figure out, even if it does fall apart a bit when revealed. The acting is fine enough, though Rothe's performance did have a moment that actually blew me away a little bit. The action is also well shot and well directed. Landon shows he has a certain level of skill in his direction, and I'd like to see what he does with an actually well put together script. In all, Happy Death Day is a fine, enjoyable slasher film. It is not in any way scary. It borderlines on comedy. However, it delivers an entertaining 90 minutes, and I'd suggest checking it out if you ever catch it on TV. 76/100",Happy Death Day

Whoever saw Groundhog Day and Scary Movie would automatically relate to this movie when watching the trailer. In the end it is really a little bit of both with some director's touch. The guy running while trying to stab people is really sloppy and the mask could be something else but it is what it is. Groundhog Day similarity is a lot especially when it comes to the message that you should be a better person. I have the feeling that some not so intellectual movies can tell you a good history, a real good one. People usually refutes that as they know the message passed along is real and some of them could really the course of their lives by building a more collaborative society. But I think most of our society never change: it is made up of cliché characters like: the popular people, the losers, the nerds, papas and mamma's and so on. What I see in everyday life is really a bunch of people looking at small screens. People avoiding interacting with other human beings and on that...this movie could send a not so dumb message at all to you.

Primarily the incoherency comes from its style of writing and scenery with characters and subplots. Although some creativity is presented, there's never enough explored or justified to enhance the messy experience.However, despite some major setbacks, there's some elements that could be appealing in terms of comedy, drama, romance, and horror. Unfortunately, for some viewers, these and other elements may either appear incomplete, irrational, or outright unsatisfying. There's many characters but few are given enough time to perform to their fullest to benefit their existence including unexpected outcomes for questionable consequences.Many opportunities and ideas, with the great performances, are missed many times to the extent that gradually alters the experience. For some, these could be easily ignored and accepted for their worth. But for others, these are weirdly written and directed concepts that deserved a greater vision in better care.

Sure, the Groundhog Day plot seems to be becoming a cliché nowadays (with movies like Before I Fall), and it was most likely going to be a jump-scare-infested film, since it came from Blumhouse, but I actually had interests in seeing this film, so I went and saw this with a friend.I thought the movie was okay, but nothing special. I liked the premise, I liked how the girl went from this unlikable bitch to an actual caring person as the film went on, and I liked how she gradually learned from the error of her ways. I also liked the design of the mask and how so many people had it in their possession, which only makes it harder to guess who the killer is.But no film is without its flaws.In some parts, it seemed like they were trying to go somewhere, like when the girl is spying on the people who she thinks might be out to kill her, but that was quickly dropped. The scene where she takes out that criminal was pretty good, but it then came off as pointless once the twist came. Oh, and speaking of that, while I did admire the twist and how they chose an unsuspecting person, the heroine jumped to the conclusion WAY too fast. Like, she just assumes all these things and it ends up being right. Like, you need to build up stuff like that. You can't just rush it.Overall, this movie was okay. It didn't rely too heavily on jump-scares, so I applaud them for that. Give it a watch if you want.",Happy Death Day

More recently the idea has been done very well with Edge of Tomorrow (my favorite Tom Cruise movie of all time). When describing any film that does the same day over and over it's basically Groundhog's Day but in a certain genre. Happy Death Day was described as Groundhog's Day as a slasher film.I was kind of interested in it but I had a huge problem with one element of the film. I didn't like that it was a PG-13 slasher film. The slasher film genre was born out of R-Rated features. Pyscho, Halloween, Friday The 13th are all R-Rated horror films. (Psycho is more a mystery thriller but it has many elements that would be used in future films) But after seeing the film I'm okay with a PG-13 slasher when it's done well.Happy Death Day follows a college student Tree (Jessica Rothe) as she wakes up on her birthday. She's mostly the typical pretty girl sorority snob that does she wants. The night of her birthday she's murdered by a killer wearing the babyface mask of the school's mascot. The next day Tree wakes up on her birthday thinking she had deja vu. But really she's reliving her birthday over and over again until she can break the loop by unmasking the person who is trying to kill her.Much like Groundhog's Day when Bill Murray's character just start killing himself to try to see if he can get out of the day, Tree dies in some slasher ways but also some creative ways. The PG-13 rating doesn't hinder the film. Although I would have loved to see it get a bit more violent. I'm sure the film wouldn't have made as much at the box office if it was R. The film is first and foremost Rothe's film. She handles the lead duties and the ""final girl"" duties so well. At first, you really can't stand her but through the film, she starts to grow on you. Her character is written well of enough by the end you are rooting for her like you should in a horror movie.There's also more to her character than meets the eye. That information only comes out when needed and is scattered out well over the course of the film. I think without her charm the film would have fallen flat. The film also builds some good tense moments. We know what the killer wears but he can strike anywhere. We are just not sure where and when. There are a few jumps scares that could have been used more effectively. The mostly gets the tension well.Not only is the film tense at times, but it's also pretty funny. I wouldn't say it is a horror comedy but it knows what type of film it is and doesn't shy away from being a bit whacky. There are quite a few moments when I was laughing out loud. When Tree gets fed up with the day she just goes all out like someone should when they have to relive the day they died over and over again. It takes a toll on the mind because no one will believe them. Israel Broussard (To All the Boys I've Loved Before) shows up as the love interest who at times does try to give Tree advice about who to figure out who is killing her.Happy Death Day was much better than I had ever expected. It's at times funny, fun slasher film that takes a subgenre used somewhat often and runs with it. I hope this starts to make the rounds in the cult horror groups because I think it makes a great statement for being a fun cult film. Jessica Rothe is a very good lead and I'd love to see her get more strong leading roles. Director Christopher Landon (Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse) with writer Scott Lobdell (Uncanny X-Men) have made a really fun easily accessible but also a nerdy horror film that satires but also embraces the cliches. I'm very excited for the sequel Happy Death Day 2U I just don't know how they are going to explain it storywise. But I can't wait to find out.",Happy Death Day
248,halfxbreed23,Take the mask off,3,15 February 2021,"I'm giving this movie a 3 because I'm ashamed to say I paid for a 1 star film.This movie is beyond dumb, horrible protagonist (both personality and plot wise) who is literally named ""Tree"" (most likely because she is dumb as one). Sidenote: just because you suffer trauma doesn't give you an excuse to be a see-you-next-tuesday nor does it make every belittling act forgivable. Watch if you want to lose brain cells. Watch if you want to waste your life. Watch if the idea of sucking a fart through a straw is your idea of a good time. This is not a horror movie at all, it is pure inanity with a wanna-be Shyamalan twist. Don't... just don't.You've been warned :(",Happy Death Day

250,xristoff93,A joke of a horror movie....FOR REAL!!,5,1 November 2017,"Some friends invited me for a horror mystery thriller movie, so all fine by me.But then, the film started.... This was no horror film. Most of the movie felt like American Pie having the naked scenes replaced with some serial killer slaying again and again the same person without any obvious reason(or any reason whatsoever as I realized in the end).Anyway, the actors were not memorable. Their acting skills were okay. I guess they would seem as something more to a teenager and this is why I am amazed by the number of good reviews this film got. The plot moves along in a totally predictable manner. We see repeatedly the same day of a rich sorority girl waking up in the room of some guy who was kind enough to pick up her pieces after she got wasted the night before. Then she goes on her day and gets killed in slightly different manner every night. Then wakes up at the guys dorm again and everything starts happening again until she finally realizes that she is trapped in a triangle-like situation. The theme is one we know all too well,so nothing much to expect there(so much for the thriller and mystery). The protagonist tries to explore some ways of solving the ""mystery"" but drops them all really fast so we see pretty much more of the same with tiny variations,while she tries to act all scared and panicked. Each morning finds her more screamy than the one before and the in- the-mean-time- reactions make things a bit funny or cringy. Certainly not scary or thrilling.The main problem with this movie is that it tries to pass itself as some horror,mystery film while it's a comedy- crime/light mystery, if it has to be called something. It's a total joke of a horror movie. And it would be amusing if it was advertised as such. You cringe,you laugh but you certainly don't feel any threat at any point. And that's understandable since you have little time to learn anything about any of the characters. What do we know? She dates and sleeps around,not surprising for a sorority girl. She gets scared when they try to kill her, but that's a normal reaction for any human being. After reliving the same thing over and over she decides to stop repeating her actions and explore other possibilities, so nothing really interesting here either.In the end we had a movie with much more laughter than the amount justified for a horror film,no plot,not a deep mystery,in contrast to what we expected and no interesting characters. But we still managed to have some fun with this thrash dialogue film. Not really worth seeing.",Happy Death Day
251,rolandjordaan2,Happy Death Day - Spoiler Free Review,7,14 September 2018,"This movie was actually a breath of fresh air in what has otherwise been a rather dire streak of bad horror movies lately. The concept may be quite simple and not exactly something we've never seen before, yet some pretty decent acting, great character development, some real tear-jerker moments (yes you read that right) and a plot that moves swiftly and never overstays its welcome, possibly makes this the best and just overall most enjoyable horror movie I have seen all year. Perfect movie to take a date to who you want scared enough to hold your hand, yet not so scared that she'll have trouble sleeping that night.",Happy Death Day
252,erikacunanan29,I enjoyed watching this a lot.,8,12 July 2018,MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.comI honestly thought at first that I wouldn't enjoy this. I don't really like senseless deaths of characters in a movie but this one was really fun to watch. You would feel bad for Tree and you would grow to care for her. I love how things turned out and how she discovered the truth. I really liked the twist they added. Carter was a wonderful person and I found Jessica Rothe really pretty.PS: The baby mask was really scary.,Happy Death Day

254,Braindead09,Worth a repeat watch...Worth a repeat watch...Worth a repeat watch,8,21 October 2017,"When the Universal logo goes into a Groundhog Day/Edge of Tomorrow roll, its not hard to guess the plot of this film, especially when the loathsome leading character meets her demise within the first ten minutes, and then rewakes takes the audience onn her investigative journey as she gets to live the next 18 hours again.This results in a myriad of different days and scenarios reaching the same conclusion. No point in telling anyone how it ends, just go along with this amusing Christopher Landon film and you will enjoy it as much as his last screen outing the really good 'scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse'. The comedy horror genre has got itself a good talent long may his reign continue.The cast are good, the running gags work, the only disappointment is the lack of gore. The soundtrack selection offered my ear a load of tracks that I had not heard before, mind you I'm not the target audience for the soundtrack downloads.Worth a watch, just try to find a screening time where the phone obsessed and plastic wrap scrunching morons are not in attendance",Happy Death Day

261,mt-95256,"Certainly much more comedy than horror. A few scares here with a lot of laughs there, but with lots of fun throughout with a charismatic, lovable lead.",7,11 November 2017,"TL;DRFully and shamelessly embraces similarity to Groundhog Day and uses that to its advantage, developing its own tone and personality - Disappointing in terms of horror – could have been stronger if they'd blended comedy and horror more - Very funny - A good twist towards the end - A very likable lead whose character believably develops more than you'd expect from a film like this——————————————————There comes a point in Groundhog Day where Bill Murray's Phil tires of his never-ending, repetitive day and starts deliberately trying to kill himself. Happy Death Day, on the other hand, while maintaining the same premise, sees the protagonist not running towards death, but running away from death again and again and again – each time she gets killed resulting in her day restarting. Though initially seeming like an interesting blend of comedy and horror, the horror is much more lite than expected, but the entertaining film is saved by the well-done comedy and the eventually very likable lead – definitely more than I was expecting (always a good thing for horror movies!)It sounds like much more of a horror/thriller than it really is. It could have been an excellent achievement, perfectly blending the horror/thriller and comedy genres; instead though the focus is much more on comedy than any kind of scares or suspense. Still, this doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. There are plenty of examples of films blending horror and comedy (Scream, the easiest example), but it's a shame that there wasn't enough emphasis on horror for it to be included in lists among greats like Scream. Instead the promotion sold it more as a horror film, inevitably disappointing the more avid horror fans. There are enough scary movie clichés and a couple of jump scares peppered throughout to satisfy most, though it's far from being able to call itself a true horror. Yet maybe you'd get away with labelling its secondary genre as 'thriller;' it's here that this film has an edge on Groundhog Day (I know, sacrilegious comment!). Happy Death Day matches Groundhog Day with comedy, but surpasses it by including a more unique whodunit plot. It's hugely enjoyable watching Tree go through her suspects and theories, ticking off her list as well as your own. Plus the twist at the end (one you absolutely do not see coming) makes it all worth it too.This isn't to say though that Happy Death Day is perfect; awards are hardly going to come by their way and there are plenty of examples of overly clichéd and cheesy lines but they're well aware of this and they play it as a strength. Director Christopher Landon is absolutely self-aware and uses all manner of horror genre clichés and cheesy lines to add to the personality, keeping it fun, quirky and, most importantly, very enjoyable. This is best seen right at the very end where one character actually compares it all to Groundhog Day, which Tree, comically, hasn't seen and isn't even aware of. It's a wonderful satire of Hollywood, tired of ideas and just copying what's come before, repackaging it and feigning ignorance, pretending it's totally original. They certainly didn't mention it for a similar film with a repetitive day, Edge of Tomorrow.A lot of how much we enjoy it though isn't just the writing, but down to the cast, specifically the leading-lady. The supporting cast are all good, particularly bitchy sorority sister Rachel Matthews and sweet and innocent male love interest Israel Broussard. But the one who really excels here is Jessica Rothe, absolutely deserving of a leading role since her only really high profile role so far has been as Emma Stone's flatmate in La La Land (she played Alexis by the way – something only hardcore fans of the musical would even have a chance of knowing). Happy Death Day is much more a showcase for her talents, showing she can do more than just sing and dance, but can carry a horror-comedy almost totally single-handedly, showing particular attention to character growth and development (something often overlooked in many films nowadays). Her character is the polar opposite to Bill Murray's counterpart in Groundhog Day; yes, he's miserable a lot of the time, but still very likable. For the first part of Happy Death Day, however, Tree is utterly unlikeable; a rude, irredeemable character we dislike despite her looks; but this opinion quickly changes once the film finds its feet and gets going. Each bad quality she seems to have slowly and believable changes as she understands her situation and tries to change it, becoming self-aware. In a Dickensian manner (a la A Christmas Carol) we quickly fall for Tree and like her very much as she changes to a very charming, quirky and lovable lead character. Props to the writing from Scott Lobdell too, but this is totally down to Rothe who makes the film the joy it is.It's impossible to take this film too seriously and to ignore comparisons to Groundhog Day; but you might as well because this is a still a different enough film to not feel like a repetitive rehash (ironically). It's a shame that it doesn't live up to it's horror promotion and shies away from its premise of marrying humour and horror since this could have really strengthened the film and made it more memorable. Nevertheless, this doesn't at all hamper any enjoyment of Happy Death Day because it's a very fun one; a bit of horror here, a lot of laughs there, lots of fun throughout with a charismatic, lovable lead. Halloween has never been happier.",Happy Death Day

Fairly entertaining, although felt sort've boring at some parts. The 'Groundhog Day' concept is pretty much unique in the horror genre, but the storyline really wasn't. It followed a fairly typical series of events and the twists weren't all that shocking. Also, the feel of the movie was odd, cuz sometimes it felt like a black comedy, other times it felt cheap and then it didn't even feel like a horror at all in some points. But overall, it's not bad. Even got jumpscared a few times (don't worry, overall wasn't too scary. It's scarier than 'It' though, so if you're looking for more horror, watch this instead). Would recommend.",Happy Death Day

265,kellyq12,Silly Fun Thrills,8,25 April 2018,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I thought it would be a mindless 90 minutes (and it kind of was) but I found it to be highly entertaining. It's the classic ""Groundhog Day"" setup of a woman who keeps waking up to the same day over and over. It's not a great day though in that it always ends with her murder. She has to figure out who's trying to kill her with each new chance/day. Concepts like this can get really repetitive, but the filmmakers managed to blow past the repetitive stuff and keep each day fresh and new. There was plenty of humor and the pacing was good. This movie is classified as ""horror"" but it's not particularly scary. Yes, it has some thrills and jumps, but it's PG-13 campy fun rather than creepy, edgy, have-to-look-away type of horror. If you're in the mood for a silly thriller with some humor and a classic mean girl character who grows and sees the fault in her ways, this one is very well done!",Happy Death Day

They just don't make them like this anymore. The characters were quirky, accessible and really well developed, specifically the protagonist. I've never heard of the actress who plays the primary role, but she has earned her stripes as a bonafide scream queen. Speaking of Scream, Wes Craven's great 90's saga, Happy Death Day takes me back to the greats of high concept, well thought out stories that don't have to be dumbed-down with gratuitous, hypersexualized, gory content for audiences. They're self aware, not afraid to poke fun at themselves, and invigorating to a genre that has been missing this type of cinematic adventure. Happy Death Day takes the viewer on a brilliant ride. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll enjoy it without feeling like you just watched a snuff film.",Happy Death Day

Hope I don't relive this day again,5,26 October 2017,"This movie is a 15 certificate in the UK and I have little to no idea why it was rated this, it is tame! It appears this was far more intended to be a comedy and not a very good one at that. I didn't hate the movie, but I was also looking forward to it finishing. I read that this movie was going to have more graphic deaths and a different ending, both of these would have helped the movie from being what it currently is, a below-average teen comedy. At the end of the day it is not a terrible movie, but also doesn't deserve its over-inflated score on here at the moment, I thought my 5 out of 10 was generous! Stick with the old Scream and Final Destination movies, you'll have a much better time.",Happy Death Day

Rothe is adorable and perfect in this role and matches up well with the love interest. The Groundhog Day premise centered around her murder is pulled off well with just enough humor so you know they aren't taking themselves too seriously. Solid writing, solid jokes and a good pay off in the end.The Bad: I had to stretch to find this because I did enjoy this movie, if there is a bad then I would say some of the situations where the villain appears are a bit forced in a ""there no way that could happen"" kind of way. But thats typical in a movie like this.The Ugly: Semi popular movie spawns ok but not as adorable sequel.",Happy Death Day

272,evrivali,A descent horror comedy,8,28 October 2017,"I went to see Happy Death day at the movie theater without knowing what I should expect since it got mixed reviews. What I saw left me completely satisfied and I am going to tell you why it was totally worth watching and not a waste of time and money as some might say! Yes the movie's main plot is someone who relives the same day over and over something that has already been covered in movies like 'The Groundhog Day' and 'Before I Fall'. someone might say the movie is not original because it steals its main plot from a classic and 'better' movie but this is wrong. 'Groundhog Day' and 'Happy Death' day do not belong in the same genre and they are completely distinct with only a few things in common which don't prevent the movie from being entertaining. Plus one great thing about this movie is the characters and I am not talking only about Tree. The way that the characters are developed throughout the whole movie is brilliant. At first you think that you are going to hate the protagonist and you will be glad every time that she is killed but man this is not true at all. You end up to love characters that under different circumstances you would hate and hate others that you would usually love. Also for those who say that Tree is stupid and not lovable: That's the whole point in movies that the main idea is that someone relives the same day! It takes a bad character and makes it good because living this experience makes him/her realize who they have been this whole time and who they truly want to be. Bill Murray was not a likable protagonist but I haven't seen anyone complaining about it because..... he was played by Bill Murray I guess. Although the movie has a few of clichés and some plot wholes here and there, it has a very well constructed plot that makes you question every single character, you don't know who the killer might be since as we mentioned before Tree is mean to everyone so you would think that most of the people would have at least a reason to kill her. Last thing: The movie has the perfect balance of horror and comedy. It has some very good scares but also some very good jokes which don't ruin the scary moments and have you laughing as like you are watching a comedy or at least me. To sum up I believe that 'Happy Death Day' is a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy because it's smart funny and scary (horror movie lovers I am going to be honest you are not going to leave the theater scared but there are some heart stopping jumbscares and creepy moments that are going to give you a good horror experience). Don't mind the mean reviews. Go to the cinema and see for yourself if it was good and for me you are not going to regret it. It is not a masterpiece but a movie doesn't have to be a masterpiece to be entertaining and this is the case with this one!",Happy Death Day
273,AbyGayle-23652,Very enjoyable,6,3 November 2019,I LOVED this ground hog day / slasher type movie. It's lots of fun and doesn't take itself seriously at all. Why anyone would choose to watch a film called Happy Death Day and then go on and complain I have no idea. Enjoy!,Happy Death Day
274,MickandRorty,"Even if it was an original premise, it would still be bad....",1,14 October 2017,"To me, the movie does not work. In the theatrical trailer, you see every one of her ""deaths"". And, since it is a PG13, what you see in the trailer is about as much detail as they show in the movie.Really not much point to this film other than trying to play the whodunnit game. Obviously, once revealed, your mind immediately addresses all of the problems with this resolution. Not for me. Didn't work. Trailer revealing everything did not help the experience either.And before you think, ""Why does he even watch the trailer if he doesn't want it spoiled?""

It will keep you guessing and anticipating to see what would happen next, which very few films have successfully pulled off.Similar to the classic movie 'Scream', there are plot twists that will keep you watching and wondering as the story unravels till the end. The main actress (Jessica Rothe) did an excellent job carrying the film as well.I thought the movie was originally rated ""R"" and I was expecting a teen slasher with a bunch of gore, but for a ""PG-13"" film, this was not bad at all.

276,ahsawesa,A Really Fun Ride,7,1 November 2017,"I had a blast with this film and i absolutely loved itYes I know this concept has been done before; Groundhog Day, Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow and etc BUT this film adds a new spin on the ""same day repeats until the mystery is solved"" concept by taking it and merging it with a slasher film premiseNow this kind of film could easily go downhill if wrongly executed but Happy Death Day does a decent job of handling this conceptIt has fun with it and pokes fun at it The film is also a bit self aware of the clichés and tropes of the slasher genre so it's understandable when something a bit dumb happensIt wastes no time and you can easily breeze through the entire film without feeling any fatigue because every twist and turn in the film keeps it fresh and entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat, it's also of the right run time, just 1 hour 35 something minutes which felt right for this film It's very well shot too surprisingly, I don't think I've seen any of Chris Landon(the director of this film)'s work before but he impressed me with this filmThere is a lot of humor which adds to the film because the film doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't take a very dark route even though it is still a horror film It also has some cool scares and suspenseful moments, not too scary but that's fine by me because of the rest of the film kept me engagedI have to mention the lead actress because my review would not be complete without mentioning her, Jessica Roth did a fantastic job as the lead girl in this film, her performance was so charismatic and its apparent that she enjoyed this role a lot because she delivered a better performance than i expected, A break out star performance and i hope to see her in more films now And not just the performance, her character development in the film was simple but handled well, and combined with her performance, it made her character and her performance very likableThe mystery of the film is engaging although once it is revealed, you might criticize some parts of it but overall the film worked so little problems can be overlookedThe soundtrack is cool too, i looked for some of the songs after the film ended and i got hooked It may not be a classic or a genre defining film but if you just want to forget your problems and have a fun time with maybe an easy to watch film, pick this up, Would be even better if you watch it in a group with maybe your friends, it'll be a good experience because Happy Death Day is very enjoyable",Happy Death Day
277,meganmarie-19902,Groundhog Day Meets Sorority Sisters,6,19 November 2018,"When I saw a trailer for this film, I sighed ""oh not another one"". I was expecting a cliché sorority sister style slasher which is well past their sell-by date. However, I was totally wrong and pleasantly surprised. The film has been described as ""Groundhog Day meets scream"" and that is exactly what Blumhouse has given us. Tree Gelbum is a spoiled and beautiful sorority sister who wakes up in the dorm room of fellow student, Carter. Embarrassed, she goes about her day by avoiding her father's calls, having a secret affair with her lecturer, hanging out with the stuck up Kappa sisters and trying to ignore Carter. As nighttime hits, Tree is ready to leave for a party until shes brutally murdered by a masked attacker. Surprised, tree wakes up and relives the same day again starting in Carter's bed and now she has to find out who might be her killer.
I am not sure whether this film is meant to have a humor aspect but it paid off, I say it is more a dark comedy than full-on horror but regardless its worth a watch and worth a hell of a lot more than the criticism it gets given.",Happy Death Day

The killer literally said, you're also a dumb b.... if I could kill every dumb person...I think the writers got lazy right around motive because technically, they could have taken it to the extremes with motive because we didn't really know the killer that well so we would have believed anything. Tree was a rotten, bratty cuss too, so anything was possible. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.",Happy Death Day

This movie turns out to be a completely and original story. The protagonist is killed and for some reason has to relive the day of her death over and over. The developments in each of the iteration make the plot advance and has a little touch of ""Mean Girls"" during it. Not gonna spoil anything, but this movie delivers exactly what it wants to deliver. Doesn't take too seriously which makes it more engaging for the viewer. A nice revival touch to a genre that got old in the 90's. Totally worth watching",Happy Death Day

283,imdb-936-837144,"A Worthy Encore to ""Groundhog Day"". Déjà Vu All Over Again.",9,16 October 2017,"Bayfield U. co-ed Theresa (Tree) Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is having a bad day in Louisiana. She's living her birthday over and over again à la ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murry played a Pittsburgh weather­man whose holiday gig repeated itself every day—only hers has a more tragic ending. She shares the same birth­day with her deceased mom; they used to celebrate it together. We wonder if anyone else shares her Monday the 18th celebration.The U.S. Constitution was signed on Sept. 17, 1787. Since in 2017 the 17th is on a Sunday, Constitution Day is celebrated on the 18th. At least we'd be comparing apples to apples, two designated holidays. But what has Constitution Day got to do with Groundhog Day?In John Trotwood Moore's circa 1897 story, ""First Monday in Tennessee"", he relates ""the origin of First Monday in April, a day now entirely devoted to the display of livestock, was a kind of feast day in the temple of Ground-Hogium, celebrated in honor of the termination of the Ground-Hog's potent prophecy."" People rode their horses to town after the six weeks of extended winter was over. ""The custom was gradually changed from Ground-Hog worship to horse swapping."" He relates the festivities: ""the pikes are fairly alive with folks, peoples, horses, jacks and nigg'rs.  that is the order in which they stand socially in Tennessee.  when 'all hands' have reached the classic town of Columbia, for instance, their first duty is to repair to the nearest bar for a drink.  When a portly gentle­­man of the first class walks in, his face shining behind a silver grey mustache,  the best in the house is set up. He's folks. But when one of the other class walks in, the bar­keeper peeps over the counter to observe his foot­gear. If he has on shoes and stockings, the bar­keeper knows his purse will stand Lincoln County's Medium; if he has on shoes but no stockings, apple brandy from the county of Warren  is set out; but if, in looking over the counter, the bar­keeper's eyes meet the sprawling flabbiness of two po'white feet, bust-head at five cents a glass is what he wants. In no case is any question asked except, 'How are you shod, partner?'""In ""Death Day"" Tree wakes up to put on her best evening dress high heels, sans stockings. She goes to a good school but the students are hardly academics, being given over to partying and hookups: strictly middle class. Her daddy, though, is shown doing some fine dining at a fancy restaurant, where a colored waitress serves the tables. Tree's sorority had a prejudice against ""chocolate milk."" Tree's mom had an endearing ""horse laugh."" Tree did a ""Lady Godiva"" number sans horse. Those were social liabilities. And at least one jack­ass in the dorm deserved a swat on the ass. Discriminations are rife in this place, which Martin Luther King Jr., who now has his own MLK Day immediately preceding Ground­hog Day, would have been dead set against.Schools receiving federal funds are mandated to teach about the Constitution on Constitution Day. Here there's a girl soliciting signatures against man-made global warming; she's taken as seriously as the water sprinklers, false car alarm, and stand-till-you-drop stunt, which all follow natural cycles. The homo­sexual who tries to go straight is not helped either. These are nonstarters here.If we want traction, we need to consider a Mormon sermon set down in Owen Wister's 1895 short story, ""A Pilgrim on the Gila"": ""Don't empty your swill in the door-yard, but feed it to your hogs.  Rotten meat, rotten corn, spoiled milk, the truck that the thought­less folks throw away, should be used. Their usefulness has not ceased because they're rotten.  nothing is meant to be wasted in this world.  Waste it by the threshold it becomes deadly, and a curse."" The food tray spilled by the dining sorority was not cleaned up right away, and Tree tosses her uneaten cupcake in her dorm room's open trash can. Festering food can be deadly. ""That sagacious patriarch told his flock the things of week-day wisdom down to their level, the cleanly things next to godliness."" To complete the cleanliness with godliness dyad, there's also a lesson against committing adultery, sleeping with one's professor to skate with good grades.These were the two things the Christian community held against MLK: he marched without a parade permit, spewing trash that the city was not prepared to clean up, and he was a well-known womanizer. But by the time Constitution Day rolls around, MLK Day is already forgotten. Relating it to Goundhog Day makes it still relevant.Article IV, Section 2, ¶ 3 of the US Constitution mandates the return of escaped slaves to their owner even from free states if need be. This was obviated by the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery. However, ratification required ¾ of the states' approval, and some southern states were occupied until they consented, making that approval non-voluntary. If MLK could be considered still subject to slavery—he was, after all, highly worried—, then his birthday replacing halves of both Llincoln's & Washington's would place him in the position of: (Prov. 30: 21-22) ""the earth is disquieted,  and cannot bear: for a servant when he reigneth."" Having the days out of whack would qualify for this disruption. Q.E.D.When Tree's friend Carter (Israel Broussard) turns to help her, we see her in good hands, Carter having been the last president before Reagan instituted MLK Day.I loved ""Groundhog Day"", having seen it 13 times on the big screen. I saw ""Happy Death Day"" on Friday the 13th, in House 13 of the multiplex. The number 13 was not wasted on this movie. The acting was all adequate to the plot. It incorporated the best of ""Groundhog Day"" while not being entirely redundant. It has my hearty recommendation.",Happy Death Day
284,Tkbn3812,"Very enjoyable thriller-horror-comedy-romance-satire film (yeah, it's all of those)",9,24 December 2017,"Happy Death Day takes the classic Groundhog Day time-loop concept and gives it a rather unique spin. The basic premise is that there's this girl, Theresa (though everyone calls her Tree), who is brutally murdered on her birthday. However, after she is murdered she wakes up back in bed, where she started that morning. This keeps happening; she wakes up, she goes through her day, she gets murdered...and she wakes up again. It's an even more terrifying take on Groundhog Day; until Tree figures out who her murderer is and stops them, she will keep dying and reliving her day.Happy Death Day has brilliant acting, especially from its lead Jessica Rothe. I thought her performance of Tree was very gripping, mainly since it flows so well from her carefree, sassy attitude into a woman gripped with raw fear and terror, before constantly alternating between the two personalities (and more). 
That's one of the things to note about Happy Death Day; it tries to be a lot of things. There's romance, there's horror, there's mystery, there's comedy and there's even some satire of college girls in a Mean Girls style (I just read all this off Wiki and I agree with the point raised.) I also agree with the Wiki page calling it 'laudatory'; the choice to do this is handled very well, and even though the film is primarily horror all these sub-genres are shoehorned in rather nicely.The three primary genres of the film are definitely comedy, mystery and horror. The horror that Tree faces every time she is murdered is coupled brilliantly with the mystery, as she tries to find her murderer. Both of these blend very well with the humour, due to Tree's level of sass throughout the movie. I think this combination of genres is very clever, especially when done right like in this movie, and kudos to the writer and director for making this blend work so well.The time-loop film concept is a rather lucrative one in any movie, and when it's played with well you can get classic gems like Groundhog Day (in fact, it's mentioned in the film and, ironically, Tree hasn't watched it). I haven't personally watched Groundhog Day but I have watched Edge Of Tomorrow, which is basically the Tom Cruise hard-core action version of Groundhog Day. While I enjoyed Happy Death Day, it doesn't always handle the time-loop section of the film with as much 'rawness' as those films. More time is dedicated in EOT and GD to the whole fear of time looping, but I suppose Tree's fear is focused more on the thought of getting murdered rather than the actual time loop itself.I highly recommend this film for horror-mystery lovers. The film isn't hard-core horror, mainly since it's juggling many different sub-plots, but it's definitely an enjoyable watch nonetheless.",Happy Death Day

286,aloysius_predato,Hallmark Channel Horror,1,11 October 2017,"The first thing you need to do is ignore any positive review of this film. There is no doubt in my mind that most if not all of these were written by persons connected with the film in some way. This movie is utterly AWFUL! Now, I cannot deny that Christopher Landon and Scott Lobdell are meekly innovative in unraveling this tale, but this is not enough to save the film. Sure, Happy Death Day will be able to score numerous jumps on people who don't watch horror movies for a living, but how hard is that. Sorry, I'm not trying to be condescending to anyone. I pride myself on my stolid nature, and I have little in the way of a life. I assume that you do, and it is my hope in writing this that I may prevent your wasting time and money in the name of Happy Death Day. You see, I'm much like many of you. I slave day in and day out beneath the yoke of mundane tasks simply so that I can continue to do so. When the week ends, I need the escape that the cinema often provides. When the escape is inadequate, I take it personally. In the case of Happy Death Day, I found myself wanting to escape the very showing of the film itself. Sure, I could have left, counted my loss and been a better man for it, but I persisted. Why? I did it for you. In theory, I wasted my time so you will not. Please, do not render my sacrifice vain. If you must see something, theaters usually boast many options. I guarantee that Happy Death Day is the worst option that exists at the present time, at least in my town. Happy Death Day is peppered with characters that do naught but remind me of people I hated in college, or, at least, ½ dimensional cardboard cutouts of those people. Jessica Rothe's protagonist, Tree, is thoroughly unlikeable from beginning to end, even after she undergoes her Hallmark-esque epiphany. I hope I didn't spoil the obvious. In any case, Rothe's performance is utterly forgettable, and, in my opinion, Landon could probably have replaced her with any mildly attractive barista in the region and achieved the same result if not better. Not only did I want to strangle Tree every time she opened her mouth, but I also wanted to strangle myself for buying the seat. Perhaps you wonder why I did not go into specifics. There really are no specifics, it's just bad, there was nothing good. It's a roller coaster ride, but not a good one; it was like one of those traveling midway coasters that give you whiplash and have you fearing for your life. I was waiting for Scooby, Shaggy and the gang to pull up in the Mystery Machine and help Tree discover who's killing her. THAT would have made for a better film. Plus, if you are intent on seeing it, who am I to spoil it. Lastly, when did a female's bare upper back begin to qualify as partial nudity? Did I miss something? I guess, technically, they're not lying, bare skin is nude skin, but, for those of you who might have been hoping for something more pulse inducing, there's nothing for you on this front either.",Happy Death Day
287,Skaigear,"Absolutely implausible, bonkers and silly, but does its job pretty darn well",7,25 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is a horror slasher movie directed by Christopher B. Landon. What if you have multiple lives and the chance to solve your own murder mystery? College sorority girl, Tree wakes up in a stranger's bed after a night of hard partying. She has a headache, does not know where she is, leaves dorm room, goes about her day encountering numerous people whom she interacts with, and then at night she is murdered by a masked killer. But there is no light at the end of the tunnel however, instead the very next moment Tree wakes up in the same stranger's bed to relive the same day over again. This concept has been done before, the last notable one being Edge of Tomorrow, but this time instead of aliens, we get a slasher. I find the movie in general to be very enjoyable. It was surprisingly fun and effective, with the right balance of humor, scares and character development.The best thing about the movie besides the awesome concept is definitely how funny and light-hearted it was. Most of the humor stems from Tree knowing exactly what is going to happen each cycle, much to bewilderment of her surrounding characters. The concept, even though it is not new, is refreshing to see it being applied to a teen horror film. It is fascinating to witness Tree experiencing the same thing over and over again but with all previous knowledge intact and seeing how she learns and grows as a person. In the beginning she is mean and terrible and just the biggest jerk to everyone, but by the end of the film, she more than softens up. Jessica Rothe as Tree was multi- faceted; she was sassy, funny, courageous and sympathetic in her portrayal.The mystery of the killer's identity is another part of the fun. The film introduces a bunch of characters in the first loop, many whom are red herrings for the audience to suspect. In the end I failed to guess who the killer was since the film deployed multiple misdirection to make sure the secret is preserved. All the characters are very entertaining and it felt like I was an active participant in the uncovering of the mystery. One character I particularly liked was Carter, the schoolmate of whose room Tree wakes up in. Their romance was something I could easily cling on thus by default, the heart of the film.While the killer reveal was surprising, the more I thought about it the more it does not really make sense. The killer would have had ample chances to kill Tree thus his/her master plan just seemed very unnecessary by the end. The PG-13 rating also did the movie no justice as it felt like a handcuff of what they could have displayed. Horror films, especially slashers should be given the liberty of showing maximum violence, and in that respect Happy Death was a little bit on the dry side. Although the buildups were suspenseful and the jump scares effective, with one catching me pretty good, the movie was not terribly scary.Overall Happy Death Day is a pretty enjoyable horror flick with an interesting concept and a very good performance from the lead actress. I was not bored for even a second because of how fun it was. Yes, it is absolutely implausible, bonkers and silly, but if you are looking for some cheap thrills and a reason to crack a smile, Happy Death Day does its job pretty darn well.",Happy Death Day

Someone doesn't agree with all of this and kills her. How boring and generic, right? But then the real movie begins, and it's a BLAST. Think of Groundhog Day meets Edge of Tomorrow meets I Know What You Did Last Summer, with just the right amount of horror, mystery and comedy, all mixed up in a clever and tense script where there's no place for the lame, useless vulgarities you'd expect from a movie about hot teenagers. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of cleavage and beautiful girls but they only serve the plot, not the viewer's libido. And it shows: I usually manage to figure out the identity of the killer midway through the movie but this time I failed. Hard. Twice.

I know they want to make us believe that the killer could be anybody but come on. Also she can drink herself into coma but Save me Lord from the milkshakes and carbs. I just watched the whole thing and nothing special. Basically Groundhog Day meets Ghost but its neither a love story or to be a ghost haunting her killer.

293,ana57709,Being a brat will get you killed.. multiple times.,6,31 October 2017,"The trailer for ""Happy Death Day"" doesn't do the actual movie justice, something we see the other way around more often. I have to admit that partially because of this I was skeptical about it, only to be pleasantly surprised by the time the credits rolled. Don't get me wrong, in no way is this film supposed to be taken too seriously, yet I am glad that one is not forced to completely lower their standards to enjoy it. Jessica Rothe's performance is great, even in the beginning of the movie where she is pretty much a total douche bag to everyone she somehow manages to come of quite charming and charismatic. And that's the thing about Happy Death Day; it's not necessarily a cinematic masterpiece, yet it has some kind of easy breezy charm to it which makes you curious. The writers make the audience play a guessing game, more specifically ""who killed me?"" by (quite cleverly) introducing all suspects on the first day. Then it's up to the audience to decide who is most likely, or better yet unlikely the killer. The answer was neither shocking nor predictable, that's the only thing that left me unimpressed. Instead of having that ""omg no way"" moment you will probably be more like ""huh? wait? it was them?"". The reveal of the killer to be confusing is a flaw that cannot be overlooked, because it is what the entire movie has led up to.But other than that Happy Death Day was an entertaining watch, I would especially love to see more from Jessica Rothe. In a way the story line feels like a homage to the oh-so lovable classics it has drawn inspiration from. I guess that's reason enough to go and check it out. Be sure not to go into it too critically tough, it's hard to take a movie serious when the ones poking most fun at it (in an innocent way) are the creators themselves.",Happy Death Day

The movie is entertaining in some ways, mostly from the premise itself, but it is executed poorly.

It is implied that the loop will not end until she survives.Now, this film is not a masterpiece and it doesn't try to be one. The script is kept simple, but it is effective.

315,sossevarvo,"Pretty fun for a while, before devolving into sickening sentimentality",5,11 October 2017,"I wasn't looking forward to this film particularly. The whole ""Groundhog Day"" gimmick seems to have already exhausted most of its potential, and the premise of this ""horror Groundhog Day"" was hardly inspiring, especially considering Blumhouse's growing credibility as a genuine producer of great horror after Get Out and Split storming the box office. This is why I was surprised to have enjoyed Happy Death Day for a good while... until it totally falls on its face. Fresh face Jessica Rothe is solid, managing to be charismatic and repellent in equal measure. The satire of college life, while in unmistakably broad, is funny for a good while, as are the repeated vignettes that greet Tree (10 points to Hollywood for that name) along her torturous cyclical ""death day."" It's all very fast and entertaining, with a handful of genuinely funny moments (mostly due to game performances from an ensemble clearly having good fun). Even the scares are decently done, with ample tension and genuinely unpredictable moments. The problem is when the movie tries to hit you with its message. There are early signs the movie is dumbing it down (a few times extraneous flashbacks are employed to remind the audience of plot details they may have forgotten) and the bloodless, profanity-less (yes, ""fricken"" is uttered) PG-13 pander is not ideal. I understand the value of the under 17s in boosting the box office for a film like this, but the audience shouldn't so obviously be aware that a certain rating is trying to be achieved. Once the third act character arc hits its emotional peak, where Tree inevitably sees the error of her ways, the screenplay goes from fun and occasionally witty to lowest common denominator soap opera, with lines so heavy handed, complemented by a ridiculously oversentimental score punctuating each beat, that you can't help but feel the studio thinks you're stupid. A few admittedly implausible but nonetheless engaging twists towards the end help things a bit, but overall Happy Death Day while entertaining is severely undone by its willingness to dumb everything down. Everyone loved Get Out, Blumhouse, you don't need to assume your audience is stupid to enjoy a film!",Happy Death Day

Good old 90s recipe with twists.,7,29 October 2017,"What was so fun with the horror movies in the 90s was how they made people unlikable before giving us the joy of murdering them. The actress was incredible at being unbearable, I was excited to see her be killed... repeatedly.I was disappointed by the lack of gore, but then I appreciated it as a clever suspense. And it sure delivered. She powerfully expressed her psychological distress.It was very fun, movies that laugh at themselves are the best comedies. It was actually deep and inspiring too about personal maturity and social interactions.Seeing her relive the same day didn't feel repetitive, she doesn't just make different choices, her attitude becomes different too. I wasn't expecting much, but even when I do, I rarely get twists and endings this interesting. I'll gladly watch again!I'm happy that more movies are using the Groundhog Day idea.

There were a number of red herrings to keep the audience guessing and a few enjoyable plot twists. There was even realistic and pronounced character development -- something rarely seen and even more rarely done well in modern cinema. I laughed a lot more than I cringed, so I would probably classify this as more of a comedy than a horror movie.

I watch the alternate scene and I'm glad they cut the out in the theatrical cut with a better ending.

331,mfoda19,Enjoyable Movie,6,6 December 2017,"I like creative ideas when it comes to making movies. This movie really amazed me with its clever plot. A girl relives her murder over and over, and each time, she carefully tries to avoid the bad incidents that occurred. You see the scenes being repeated somehow, but each time there's something new happening. As if it's naturally instinctive for the human mind to try to alter the trials and tribulations of life. A way of survival to be exact. This movie is a light horror for me. It's not much scary, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. I recommend this one to you.",Happy Death Day

333,roscoe666,Neat little time-loop comedy thriller,9,30 January 2018,"Absolutely cracking, delightful, feel good, time-loop slasher-comedy, with good performances throughout and a good plot development. The lead actress especially puts in a really good performance, but overall, top marks to all concerned.By avoiding most of the issues with of other time-loop films (ie repetition), what emerges is a fresh take on the usual trope, with a concrete objective for the heroine, and a fresh perspective.If I had to criticise, I would say the conclusion was rather inevitable, but this in no way detracts from the overall impact. The production values belie it's mid-budget.To the reviewer who thought it was a rip off of Groundhog Day, bear in mind that that film, itself, was a rip-off of 12:01pm (the director and writer sued Columbia Pictures, the makers of Groundhog Day).Ultimately, strongly recommended, and this is from a jaded film-watcher, who has been reviewing films for over 30 years.",Happy Death Day
334,rkoch1,A lot of bad decisions will ruin a potentially good movie,2,20 November 2017,"**My review reveals the murderer:The main character was so blatantly stupid that it ruined this movie. I was enjoying it for the most part but there were things which just drove me crazy. The main thing that did it for me and made me feel like I just wasted 2 hours of my time was when the main character, Tree takes a knife to a police officer's throat and takes his gun, just to tell him that a prisoner is about to escape. She therefore goes into the medical bay with a gun and ends up shooting the patient/suspect without any subsequent charges or punishment. Also, it's obvious after the first few times of dying that she only needs to see the face of her murderer, but each time she gets close to him she does something stupid and runs away instead of trying to de-mask her assailant. I just thought this movie was bad for those reasons. It had the ""stupid blonde"" appeal to it which gets old in my honest opinion. It was obvious that the murderer was her roommate from the beginning because she was outrageously nice, they could have done a better job not making it so obvious. I did like the performance of her roommate, however. Also, the main character Tree was very self-absorbed and conceited, I didn't like her despite the character development she experienced through her subsequent lives. The movie wasn't AWFUL but it was hard for me to love. I would truthfully give it a 5/10 rating due to the stupid decisions of the main character, but I had to drop it a little lower because there's no way it deserves a near 7/10 as the community seems to believe. Remove the stupid decisions and make a smart protagonist we can respect, and the movie would have been a 7/10 easy, maybe even higher.It's basically like Triangle/Butterfly Effect/Edge of Tomorrow, although I don't think it deserves a better score than those movies.",Happy Death Day
335,sfwriter999,Bad execution of a good high concept,5,18 October 2017,"I'm a big fan of Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, and Triangle. I had high hopes for this as there's a formula for this genre of try again until you succeed movie. In Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, the main character is unlikable with character flaws and as the character explores his world and tries to figure out what he/she needs to do to get out of the time loop, they through learning experiences become a better person and get past their flaws. In Groundhog Day, a selfish person becomes charitable. In Edge of Tomorrow, a coward becomes brave. In Triangle, the victim becomes the stalker.In Happy Death Day, the selfish becomes caring.In the the other three mentioned movies, the lessons learned are over a long time and through experimentation. In Happy Death Day, the experimentation happens, but the break through comes too easily. In the earlier scene before the character turn, she is still mean. Afterwards, she's suddenly nice as if through a eureka moment. We don't see the change and she's suddenly nice.Too much time is spent on the first kills which take up too much screen time. The kills are not that innovative or funny. More time should have spent on her character development. At one point, I thought, why don't she just tear the mask off the killer? Then she'll know who it is even though she'll die.The non-supernatural killer also popped out of nowhere with no reason as to how the killer found her. At some point, I thought there was some supernatural agency, but there wasn't.The love story is a bit facile too. Just because the guy tried to save her life, she falls in love with him. A bit pat.Anyway, a good high concept idea that's executed poorly. This okay movie could have been much, much better.",Happy Death Day

But, they made a perfect package of murder-mystery-thriller, romance and a sweet little college drama with some great acting performances.It's intense throughout, not boring for a second. I admired the twist at the end which i could not predict at all. The main character endures a great deal of personality changes and see her for truly who she is. The only problem i had with it, at the beginning scene they tried to jumpscare the audience using SOUND, which is a bit cheesy for such a captivating movie. But it's only that one scene, so it's alright i guess.The romance between the two main characters really worked.I highly recommend this to every horror fans out there. It's not exactly gory.

343,nikcoppin,Deathly Amusing,8,22 June 2018,"Slasher-mystery-meets-Groundhog Day-meets-College Rom-Com-meets-Teen friends movie.I think that pretty much sums up this film.Yep, it's pretty ridiculous in it's concept, but I always say that as long as a movie knows what it is and it's well executed, then all is good.And as silly as this movie sounds, I found it to be a rather well-spent 90 minutes of my time.We start with our lead character 'Tree' waking up on her birthday in a fellow student boys dingey dorm room after a night of serious shenanigans and has to take her embarrassing walk of shame across the campus to the sorority house where she resides with other girls who she doesn't appear to like very much.And they don't really like her either it seems. Because our Tree is growing into a bit of a nasty brat. She is rather unpleasant to her housemates, her bit of fun from the night before and even her poor long-suffering old dad.But alas on her way to a surprise party that night, she finds herself the unfortunate victim of a knife attack to a mysterious person in a creepy baby mask only to wake up in Carter's dingey dorm again.What appears to be a bad dream and a bit of déja-vu soon becomes the far more sinister and annoying circumstance of having to endure this day time and time again until she can discover who the killer is and how to break the cycle. But of course, poor Tree is such a meany that it could literally be dozens of potential suspects.See, all sounds very stupid doesn't it?But Jessica Rothe as Tree is a nice combination of sexy, bitchy and funny as she sets about her task of cracking the code and putting an end to her nightmare.There are some nice little surprises and twists and turns along the way too. Just when you think it all amounts to a bit of a tepid underwhelming end, something else comes along. Jolly good stuff.And while it is still all unpretentious silliness and hardly a deep voyage of discovery and coming-of-age story, there's more than enough little messages with regard to how you should and shouldn't treat friends, family and even strangers.There will be no awards won here that's for sure, and maybe some bad reviews too, but I found this murder mystery, comedy, love, friends, thing, whatever very enjoyable indeed.",Happy Death Day

Most of the slasher movies that get released nowadays just follow the same old concept and are generally poor imitations of each other. Happy Death Day however was surprisingly different.The Groundhog Day meets Scream combination really managed to hold my attention. It was something different and fresh.It had all the traditional elements for a teen slasher movie, the mean girls, the nerdy kid you root for, the forbidden sex, the lesson to be a nice person and you won't get killed. Not forgetting the creepy masked killer who face you will stick in your mind and that you spend the whole movie trying to figure out who it is. Also, the scenes that make you jump out your skin.The movie adds comedy in to the mix which actually works well and doesn't take anything away from the scare factor. Another refreshing factor is that the movie doesn't rely on gore to scare the audience which is another rarity nowadays.I particularly like the way the movie blindsides you near the end, just when you think you have it all figured out it throws you a curve ball.The cast all appear to be up and coming. There are no big names to try and sell this movie which I actually like. However, this is probably why it has not been advertised as much as other films.I think this movie has been undersold.

It follows Tree Gelbman (jessica rothe) a spoilt and self absorbed sorority girl who is forced to relive the same day on repeat, which concludes in her being brutally murdered by a psycho in a spooky mask.If this sounds like Groundhog day with a slasher twist that essentially wraps it up in a nutshell. It even pays homage to the classic Bill Murray film with one or two easter eggs. Happy Death Day exceeds expectations, with comic relief thats actually funny, good character development and vindication of our main protaganist being its redeeming qualities. The story is relatively simple and predictable, it aint going to require too much critical thinking. But I think it achieves its purpose, it is an entertainment film, and I did find this movie thoroughly so.",Happy Death Day

370,kevinlemenager,Worst Birthday Ever,8,21 October 2017,"Happy Death Day is the first (and so far only) time I went to see a movie on a whim. More so, because I never go to see horror movies in theaters. Along with comedies, horror movies never felt like they were worth a theater going experience. So my going to see Happy Death Day wasn't based on it being a horror movie. It actually first caught my attention when I saw the TV spots for the movie. I took notice of the ""time loop"" storyline and that at least made me curious. Then I realized that October was going to be a mostly scarce month for movies. I had seen two movies by myself this year already, and they were both disappointments. I needed to see a movie that would redeem the year for me. Happy Death Day has a ""time loop,"" an attractive lead, and plus it was Friday the 13th, so I figured why not. It was a good idea, because Happy Death Day is a lot of fun. Tree (short for Theresa) is your typical selfish college girl who sleeps around and parties. She wakes up on her birthday and lives out her day until she is suddenly killed by a killer in a baby mask. The ""time loop"" plays out pretty much as you'd expect (a lot like Groundhog Day). With the main character first being confused, then having a break down, then doing whatever they want, and then finally improving their life. The horror element felt like it came in at just the right moments. Though the best thing about the movie is easily Jessica Rothe's performance. Her character is funny, smart, and eventually badass. I definitely wasn't expecting much from this movie. Happy Death Day was a very pleasant surprise.",Happy Death Day

373,Bonesnap,Suprisingly fun and entertaining!,8,22 January 2018,"Ten minutes in and I was rolling my eyes. It all seemed so predictable. It was clearly a mash-up between Scream & Mean Girls & Groundhog Day. Yawn! The main character Tree is so patently and predictably unlikeable she's literally horrible to every single person she speaks to until about 20 minutes into the film, so you just KNOW that regardless of plot there's going to be a redemption story because there's no way they could make it to the end of the movie with the main character carrying on like Queen Bitch of the Universe literally ALL THE TIME. So, it seemed a little bit predictable and I almost didn't bother watching it through.But. The character development is actually done quite well. The plot has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. And at times - despite my early cynicism - I found myself smiling and enjoying the feel good redemptive moments. The lead actor (Jessica Rothe) really gets to show her acting chops - unusually for 'this type of movie' there's lots of physical comedy and good-natured humor too. So, for me it was a surprise, it was great fun. They took what should have been a run-of-the-mill, B-grade, schlock-slasher-comedy and turned it into a well-executed, above-par, enjoyable gem of a film. Recommended!",Happy Death Day

375,Voklova,Hope you got your wish because you've just found a DEFINITE RECOMMEND for a movie,10,28 January 2020,"The film follows mean girl Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman whom on her birthday gets murdered by a killer in a baby mask. After realizing she is able to restart the same day over and over again, it's up to her to find out who is killing her in an attempt to survive Til the next day.I originally avoided this movie before as it looked like your generic slasher horror movie. But after watching it I regret judging it before actually looking at it closely. Although I literally just watched the movie, it clearly has made a positive first impression on me as a viewer. I mean there's so much to love about this film that it's surprising the use of the plot for ""Ground Hog Day"" hadn't been used in any horror movies before!Some things I really liked about the film was it's efficient pace, although the movie is standard in length, the fact it's able to keep viewers off their phones for the entirety of the film makes it feel like the movie is twice it's length. There were virtually no times in the film where it felt boring or slow, everything was well timed and sequenced that it really kept me glued to the screen which is made it almost impossible to look away. This technique is often difficult to master in films as it will basically determine if the audience is interested or not.Another thing that I really enjoyed was the fact the film really broke the final girl cliché, this is because the main protagonist Tree is anything but. If anything, Tree is more of the character that we'd just love to get her throat slit in the first few minutes because it's made pretty clear that she is no saint just based on the trailer alone, and her behaviour in the first portion of the film. But as we slowly come to know the backstory of the character, and everyone else in the film, the perspective of the protagonist ,and other additional characters, slowly shifts to the point where we feel sorry for judging to quickly. This eventually leads to the ""go go go"" effect in which viewers start cheering for the heroin they've all been waiting for. In fact, the decision to make the mean girl the main character actually benefited the film better because it helps the protagonist reflect on her life and appreciate all the little things that were taken for granted before.Another thing that should be worth noting is the use of false endings. Several times it felt like the film was gonna end, but as you keep watching, it's clear there's only one end result in order to end this unending cycle of deaths and that is only shown in the final act where all is revealed. This aspect of the film was quite interesting cause like a video game, each time the player (Tree) dies, whomever is playing can build off from whatever they learned before. This leaves the audience questioning what is going to happen next which is very effective as it basically helps the ending not be totally obvious.In terms of acting, much praise to cast because all the characters played their role with much precision which only helped create a unique atmosphere of different characters in the movie. Much praise to the lead actress Jessica Rothe as she really carried this film from start to finish and really made her character believable and enjoyable to watch as she goes through madness in finding out the truth. Good job!It should also be worth noting that the film does a good job of blending the two opposite genres of comedy and horror into this one film as it really helped the movie relate to the audience on an emotional level. Audiences will be laughing, gasping, tense up, cry a bit and say the famous ""ohhhhh"" by the time the film raps itself up in a nice bow. It was also refreshing to see a masked villain in the film as it really felt like there haven't been much masked killers in recent years for horror movies.With that said I really didn't see much flaw in the film because it was just that good! I enjoyed it from start to finish and I'm sure anyone else who've seen it will agree it's just that awesome of a film! Definitely will be one of my favourite movies and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh new horror movie!",Happy Death Day

However, it's all part of the set-up and they do this very well, you think you know but you don't.
There's little surprises all the way through and it all becomes a lot of fun without cringing over cheesy jokes or serious plot holes. It has the bare minimum of slash, a good dose of humour and even throws in a wacky romance which all add up to a bundle of fun.

I thought the killer was a little obvious, but it was a satisfying twist. tree was a great protagonist, and I'm a fan of the lead actress, knowing her from La La Land and her MTV show, Mary and Jane.

390,jcosully,A good and thoughtful PG-13 Horror Movie,8,24 October 2018,"I was pleasantly surprised by Happy Death Day. It had an interesting premise that wasn't undermined by its PG-13 rating restriction. The main element of this movies sucess was an great and possibly star making performance by Jessica Rothe. She portrays a mean girl with a sad backstory. This is usually a very cliche way to create characters, but she manages to make it unique. If she hadn't brought that factor to the movie, it could've been a lot, lot worse. The rest of the cast does a sufficient job, nothing amazing, but nothing that ruins the movie. Cliche people playing cliche roles. You have the rich, snotty and bratty girls, the nice guy, the creepy and suspicious roommate, the distant father and the handsome secret love interest. Some of these characters don't serve any purpose besides making the movie longer and making the main characters change more apparent. On another note, the plot is pretty interesting, but there are a couple spaces in the development in the characters and what is actually happening to Tree, and how it is happening. Maybe this will be explained in the sequel? I hope so. There wasn't too much gore in the movie, so if you're looking for a horror movie without blood, thus could be one of them. The kills are fine, but not really shown, because it wouldn't look realistic without blood, or the creators would have to add blood and change the rating to R. The movie itself isnt that scary, with a few jump scares. There are some scenes with good tension building, so at least that gives the film a slightly scary/creepy aspect. Finally, the ending isn't great. It doesn't answer that many questions, and is a bit unsatisfactory, as to who the killer is and how they did it. As or how the day keeps repeating itself, there is nothing to answer our connections. Again, hopefully they answer that question in the sequel.",Happy Death Day
391,batmanjokercatwoman,If Groundhog Day was a Comedy/Horror,10,21 October 2017,"The character of Tree starts off as this unlikeable character that represents the selfish but pretty blond girl whom you expect to be killed in slasher films. Which is exactly what happens to her, the only difference is she doesn't stay dead and when the day loops backs she's only one to remember the event. This sends Tree on a journey of highs and lows, at first she's in denial, then she's traumatised and then she starts to enjoy it. As she begins a murder mystery to hunt down who's going to kill her. Until all her previous deaths begin to take a toll on her physically and mentally, she realises she can't keep looping too many times. Through this we see her grow as a character and become the heroine we all route for.Newcomer Jessica Rothe delivers a great performance, with some great comedic timings as well as some really emotional moments. She also makes Tree's arc believable making it feel natural rather than forced, letting us follow her on her journey while buying into her complexities as a human-being before we get into her backstory. It follows the Groundhog Day formula well, with a few differences such each death having repercussions on her next loop, as well as a very clever twist as to when the loop will finally end. Each repeated day is well done, never feels too repetitive and each time she wakes up represented differently depending on her state of mind with different camera shots and sounds. The film also has the advantage of being a comedy/horror as it never takes itself too seriously and is always self-aware. Like the Scream franchise it's a slasher with a murder mystery plot as well as a satire on horror, along with that it fits well with other recent self- aware comedy/horrors like Cabin In The Woods, Tucker And Dale Vs Evil and The Final Girls.",Happy Death Day

That feeling didnt develop as i wanted, though my attention was still grabbed, my prediction of the killer was still wrong, though it was a back up of mine, and not one of those that would be impossible to guess, which i enjoy in slashers since usually its someone never mentioned or is made to be unimaginable as the killer. however it wasnt a super fresh take, nor did the scenes in the movie have much cohesion as far as feel and many things were left unexplained, like why the heck was the boy leaning under his desk every morning!?!?!? shes looking for suspicious people the whole movie yet never asks him what hes doing!?! either way, despite the many problems and issues i had with the film, it something i dont regret watching, it made me laugh and smile at parts even if it made me upset at others. if your a fan of slahers and the horror genre, i recommend it, if your overly critical and only want films you view as ""art"" then i certainly recommend you avoid this movie.",Happy Death Day

She wakes up one morning on her birthday in a stranger's dorm room hungover and confused. She continues on with her day condescending as ever to everyone around her as well as ignoring her father's call and disregarding her roommate's attempts to wish her a happy birthday throwing away the birthday cake she made for her. She also has an affair with one of her professors. That night as she heads off to a party a mysterious man wearing a mask of the campus mascot murders her. Suddenly she awakes the next morning in the same spot in the dorm room. At first she gets the impression that she is having déjà vu and dismisses the previous day but when the night arrived and the mysterious man in the mask appears again and murders her. When she awakes the next day she realizes that she is stuck in some sort of loop and needs to evade her murderer.Making it a horror film with a mysterious slasher chasing down our main character no matter how she attempts to evade him with an interesting twist at the end make for a fresh take on the concept, as well as the fact that each time that she dies the death takes a toll on her body and she gets weaker each time. The cast does a well job portraying their characters, especially the lead role and it is interesting and quite enjoyable to see her grow as a character during the movie especially since she was such an annoying character at the start.The repetition of day movies are often cliche and and repetitive themselves but surprisingly this movie was quite enjoyable.

I would say this is slightly more of a comedy than a horror but the slasher scenes do deliver. This is probably the most fun I've had in a horror movie since watching ""Cabin in the woods."" Which though they have totally different premises, the spark of creativity and spunk where present in both. As others have mentioned, I just don't feel like the trailers really serve this movie justice, but then again I suppose they didn't wanna give away too much.

410,99brendanallen,Happy Death Day,9,24 January 2019,"Warning: this review may contain spoilersHappy Death Day - based on Groundhog Day, they did a really good job on doing a parody of this movie, expect the fact on the main character being murdered. The main character didn't really want anyone to know it's her birthday, until the first time she gets killed. After the ""1st"" day, it turned into a comedy. (Small Spoiler) At the party on the second day, it was a surprise party for Tree, the main character, and again, she doesn't like to anyone know it's her birthday. That's when things kinda took a turn forward. From the first repeated day (aka day 2) and on, it was funny. Some of comedy were sexual jokes, but they were interpreted in a good way.What I liked about this movie is that not many movies are a Horror Comedy. I was expecting a lot more horror, but in this movie, there were a couple of jump-scares. Mostly, it was comedy. Now, I know you people think this movie is sucky based on how much a comedy it was. It isn't. You have to know Groundhog Day in order to sorta understand it.I went with two of my friends. Both of them never seen Groundhog Day. The movie was also a thinking movie, along with being horror and comedy. You have to think back to the time where certain things happened. Now, without getting into further detail, the ending was definitely a plot-twist. She thought she killed the person, but it was the same day as before.I didn't count, but I read in another review the cycle was 16 days before the day advanced. Not that bad compared to Groundhog Day, which was 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days. They sliced 8 years and 8 months.Overall, Happy Death Day was a good movie. I wished there were a lot more horror, but it definitely had the aspect of Groundhog Day. There was hardly any cursing, mainly name calling, which includes words you hear in teenage lives. But overall, well worth the money.",Happy Death Day
411,jessb41975,Very entertaining and clever with a FANTASTIC twist!,7,26 November 2017,"I really wasn't expecting much from this movie. I thought it would be just another cheesy horror movie that only I could love. I was way wrong and pleasantly surprised.Though it does contain some elements of a horror movie, such as our female lead being brutally murdered every night, I would possibly classify this as a mystery/thriller comedy. It was a fun movie with a fantastic twist ending. I'm pretty good at figuring out who the ""killer"" is in mysteries, but I NEVER saw this one coming, even inn a movie where EVERYONE was a suspect.There were many subtle nods at other movies throughout this one. The biggest, and not subtle at all, was the premise itself, which is basically a new take on ""Groundhog Day,"" and I was so happy that as the credits were starting to roll that one of the characters (REALLY trying NOT to leave spoilers) said to Ree that her situation was exactly like Groundhog Day. This is NOT a scary movie. It's funny, but NOT a comedy. There's a great sense of suspense throughout the film, which is well-acted by all, okay MOST, of the characters. So if you enjoy a movie that makes you constantly guess and re-guess whodunit, give HAPPY DEATH DAY a watch. Of nothing else, it's at least entertaining.

412,nicolopulcinelli,Worse than Before I Fall,6,19 November 2017,"I like this type of movies based on time loop. I watched all the most famous movies of this genre, like Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, Dejavu, Donnie Darko, Looper Tringle and Predestination. This summer I saw Before I Fall and I like it very much. Also Happy Death Day is not bad, but I think that Before I Fall is more intense and explains better the circularity of the time and the goal that the main character have to achieve at the end. Happy Death is a very funny movie, Jessica Rothe is very well immersed in the role, but the plot in some points is a little bit weak, for example in the part of the wanted fugitive in the hospital. In conclusion, I think that this film is good and entertaining for passing a evening but in the future I will not remember it as a masterpiece of the time loop genre.",Happy Death Day

In this Black Comedy slasher we watch sorority sister Tree Gelbman played by Jessica Rothe as she relives her birthday over and over as she continues to be hunted by a killer wearing a baby mask. Many films have done the reliving the day type movies, Groundhogs day arguably the best known but Rom-Com was not going to contain this premise. Action sci fi movie edge of tomorrow featuring Tom Cruise, also has this premise but my favorite so far is Happy Death Day. The movie is just fun, with unique and Throw back kills aplenty in this slasher. An actual character arch other than shy girl becomes badass finds its way in the playful slasher. I enjoyed the arch they choose and feel that Jessica Rothe portrait it very well through the movie. Bringing this premise into horror was a stroke of genius though this film is full of fun and hilarity it is actual quiet smart. The plot is just so smart and executed so well it hides behind this facade of a stupid comedy slasher but turns out to be a murder mystery that keeps you guessing till the end. This Film lets you know early on that it does not take itself seriously nor should you, It makes fun of the horror genre including itself and it's inspiration Groundhogs Day. This movie is a much watch especially for horror fans. I would even use this film as an introduction to the genre for those who are not fans.",Happy Death Day

However, it became painfully clear the director rode in on the coattails of Vaughn in freaky and he simply didn't have anyone to save him this time.Someone call Lady Gaga because these characters were shallow I don't think I felt a morsel for any single one of them except the roommate who kept getting dragged due to us inopportune entrance and her father and I'm thinking that had to do more with the fact at his age he actually entertained a film like this. Queue Regina George 2.0, our ""protagonist"" was simply a terrible person using the excuse of her mother's passing to treat other humanbeings like bargain hookers on the strip. I wanted to see her get killed from the very first scene.She lacks any general awareness or mental fortitude as she is killed over and over again somehow unable to reach her scrawny little arms high enough to, I don't know... remove the killers mask? It really becomes painful to sit through her doing one stupid thing after another, until finally she starts to narrow it down as she goes through a mile long list of suspects.... come on girl how many people have your name in their burn book?Regardless the banter here is weak, just half baked gen z dribble the director saw on Twitter, and his male characters are stereotyped to the point I don't know if this is a movie and a feminism campaign ad.By the end of this ""film"" if you can call it that, I didn't want her to die anymore I simply wanted someone to put me down like the family dog in a 1950s western.",Happy Death Day

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is definitely for the best. If anyone walks into a movie about a sorority girl living the same day over and over and being killed over and over and expects it to be some genre-defying horror perfection, that's on them. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie by any means. Jessica Rothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis are fantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make us root for them. Rothe's character wasn't the typical horror movie sorority girl, either. She was cunning and badass. She made us believe she could actually figure this mess out. If you don't change your mind on who the killer is at least twice throughout the film, you aren't paying attention.There are curveballs thrown left and right, which made my theater gasp and yell numerous times. You think the movie is about to end on at least two different occasions. The script is smart, there's horror, there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerous directions, while also making sure you have fun along the way. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite campy horror flicks out there. It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took some inspiration from. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again, it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance of clichés. With that, though, there are still a handful of clever moments I certainly was not expecting.",Happy Death Day

There also seem to be a lot of people who are inordinately upset about it sharing the ""reliving the same
 day"" idea with Groundhog Day and they give it 1 star because of that. What?I did not see the trailer (and having watched it after the movie, I'd say avoid it) so I knew very little other than it was about a girl who kept repeating the same day - a day which ends with her dying. I thought the lead actress was great. Good comic timing, a very expressive face, and definitely telegenic. It was also a really nice change to watch a ""teen"" movie that isn't non-stop swearing and crude humour. I wouldn't say this movie is necessarily ""sweet"", but it does have charm.

441,dooooominic,Happy Death Day Triumphs with its unoriginal originality,7,24 October 2017,"Happy Death Day (2017), directed by Christopher Landon who is famous for his Paranormal Activities franchise, has created its own genre and performs way over my low expectations regardless of its seemingly ""familiar"" plot from Groundhog Day (1993). The protagonist Tree, a sorority girl, has found herself stuck living in the same day over and over again ending with her being murdered every night by the same killer repeatedly. Tree thus goes on a personal adventure, in attempt to discover the true identity of the killer to hopefully one day prevent the murder to happen and thus get out of the loop. She thus began a journey of self-discovery and self- redemption with the help of her only friend through recognizing the consequences of her own actions in order to try and solve her own murder mystery. The film consequently created its own genre of horror rom-com, scary but yet heart-warming and funny at the same time. Some of Tree's ideas upon discovering she is living in the same day over and over again are silly if not laughable, since there will be no consequences the next day whatsoever due to her eventual seemingly inevitable death at night, until one point where her actions suddenly do matter and she has to make a life or death decision in order to survive and have future that she desires. Being a veteran horror movie director, Christopher Landon succeeds in showing off his skill of dropping settle hints right in front of the viewers alongside with a surprising twist in the end. Shots of settle hints are shown since the beginning of the movie, providing the audience an opportunity to try and solve the murder before the ultimate reveal of the killer's identity on screen. A typical college campus setting, anyone could be the suspect, thus Tree makes a list of possible suspects alongside with the audience who are creating their own lists, and debunks every single possibility until there is no more suspects and making the murderer almost as someone who possesses superpower, but yet with a sole purpose of killing Tree. But in the end, everything makes perfect sense. The film raises questions on causality and consequences, especially by setting the story on a college campus; it rings the bell for students with a warning that even tiny, everyday actions could have detrimental consequences, similar to the idea of The Butterfly Effect (2003) or just the theory of the butterfly effect itself. With a familiar theme and a nearly identical plot (if one could imagine Bill Murray being murdered by a groundhog repeatedly in Groundhog Day), the film still does not fail to impress the audience of its beautifully written, heartwarming story; Jessica Rothe's incredible performance of Tree could also crown her the title of a future scream queen. If you are looking for the perfect Halloween movie this year, Happy Death Day is a must watch for its unoriginal originality in its story line and genre, without too much blood and gore that is seen in almost every other horror movies of 2017.",Happy Death Day

As seen in the previews, Tree is reliving her birthday over and over, trying to figure out the man behind the mask. While the movie is a thriller, it was really the surprising pop ups that get you.

In the first ten minutes, it seems kinda cool, but after that the girl keeps dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up.. Also, it is pretty obvious who wants to kill her from the very beginning of the movie. It is so pointed out that she is being such a bitch to her roommate, that you can guess that it is her who wants to harm her. More over, at some points, the movie tries to hard to be funny. The only part that i smiled (not laughed), it was when her boyfriend pranked her in the end. I found the other parts really lame.

I'm rating it based on what I expected, and I was certainly impressed. This movie wasn't trying to be anything more than another murder movie, but what made me want to see it was the idea of taking Groundhog Day (which it fully admitted to ripping the idea from) and turning it into a slasher film. I was actually surprised it held back on gore and blood. I was fully expecting it to be all the tropes of gross-out killings, but it was instead focused more on character development and the story. I admit the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but again, it's a slasher movie. It's trying to win any academy awards here. In many ways I think it's parodying those one-dimensional characters of college trope characters and the ""last girl"" in horror movies because it goes all-in on establishing the main characters as somebody you're meant to hate at first. The ending genuinely took me in a direction I didn't anticipate, and then it took me back to what I was expecting, but did it in a way that I felt fresh.

She wakes up in some guy's dorm room, much to her dismay, only to realize she's reliving the day of her birthday and murder over and over again. Laughs, a few good scares, plot twists, and even a single tear (Yes, the acting is that good and Tree shows real growth) make this a fun escape in the magical world of the movies.

It is painfully delivered and possibly one of the weakest excuses for a plot twist I have ever seen.When evaluating this as a part of the horror genre... well... it doesn't belong to the genre even remotely. Any violence or gore is shyed away from each time the protagonist is killed because it instantly cuts to her waking up. I'm not saying blood and guts are necessary to a horror film (see It Follows) but I was at no point in this movie even remotely spooked in the slightest.In terms of redeeming qualities, I felt that the acting was adequate, given the poor script the actors were left to deal with. There were some details that I enjoyed about the film, for example the admittedly witty sticker on the door of the room the protagonist finds herself waking up in repeatedly. But aside from these minor things, this movie really doesn't deliver in any way. Poor.",Happy Death Day

The film is a mixture of Final Destination, Groundhog Day and Scream, just without the gore. Jessica Rothe's performance was outstanding and made her character likeable.

468,dabolafia,Just What the Sub-Genre Needs,8,27 April 2020,"For the most part, PG-13 horror movies are like non-alcoholic beer. Really, what's the point? By making them these flicks essentially gutless (pun intended), the producers are robbing aficionados of their guilty pleasures.But every so often, something like ""Happy Death Day"" comes along. It is the ultimate in high concept -- ""Groundhog Day"" with a murderous bent -- but is so smartly crafted, with at least two ""didn't see THAT coming"" twists... which is about two more than most of its ilk.It helps that the film is anchored by a terrific performance by Jessica Rothe as Tree, a stuck-up sorority girl who dies (by her estimation) 17 times before she finally puts together all the pieces of who wants her dead (and why).Saying that ""Happy Death Day"" far exceeded expectations would be damning it with faint praise, as the bar is set so monstrously low. But it gives the sub-genre of teen-friendly horror a massive goose, which it so desperately needs. A major high-five to writer Scott Lobdell for a whipsmart script, and to director Christopher Landon for making the most with of a modest budget and a no-name cast.If, like most of us, you've got some extra time on your hands while you're in quarantine (or otherwise avoiding the outdoors), I highly recommend it.",Happy Death Day

I just saw it on the cinema schedule and I decided to give it a try. For the first 30 minutes it kinda reminded me of Edge of Tomorrow(I haven't watched Groundhog Day). Then the movie started to look like a horror movie from '90s, which is nice if you ask me, because I was aching for something like I know what you did last summer, Scream or Final Destination(first one before the series turned into a bloodfest). Also, the cast fits perfectly with the roles and the characters. The ending was also a thumbs up, given the feeling the movie gives you. Overall, this was not a waste of time. It's far from being an excellent movie, don't look at it as a classic or something. You could call it a smiling face in the crowd, I guess that sums up pretty well this movie.",Happy Death Day
472,savagdog1,Fun horror/comedy. Perfect for Halloween,8,13 October 2017,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I admit I rolled my eyes and groaned that they were trotting out the circular time gimmick again. It was of course classic in Groundhog Day, but never seemed to click since then. I was dubious, but after seeing it with my own eyes, I can say I had a great time. I'm not sure if Blum House intended it to be funny, but it had a lot of humor in it, enough I would say to qualify it as a dark comedy. The cast was superb and while it didn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of murders/deaths, I didn't mind because the story was so well connected and it really had me guessing right up until the end. Another litmus test for the quality of this movie is that the audience was rather quiet during the presentation. I've been to enough of these films to know that when you get a young audience seated in the dark and the film is a snooze, they'll start to talk and whisper and just annoy the Hell out of you. This movie managed to hold the attention of the entire audience and in this day and age I must say, that is an achievement in and of itself. I wasn't prepared to enjoy Happy Death Day as much as I did, but even I can admit when I was wrong. It worked from start to finish. I wasn't aware that Scott Lobdell wrote the script, but when I saw his name in the credits, I realized another reason I enjoyed it. I am familiar with his writing in the comic book industry and he is one of the more notable scribes. It's good to see the skills transfer.",Happy Death Day

It also had wooden acting, inconsistencies galore and zero scare factor (the PG-13 rating was a dead giveaway as that's as bad sign in a horror movie). The lead actress looks like she could be on her way to some success...but just not in this. The most irritating part for me (not giving anything way due to trailer) is that no matter how long or short she 'lingers' on the repeated opening scenario...the next sequence of events are always in the same. That just wouldn't be the case IRL. Anyway. I wanted to like it as it had good premise, but it just didn't do it for me.",Happy Death Day

491,psychokinesis,"A funny idea, and a funny horror",5,12 September 2018,"I found this movie to be very light and funny. I almost wouldn't classify it as a horror. However, it wasn't too surprising. I guessed the killer nearly immediately yet the movie played on an on seemly trying to throw me off. I even almost thought I had it wrong once with a ""no way, really?"" moment. I was full the classic moments where one is going ""why?"" or ""don't go there!"" of a slasher movie which keeps it interesting. The main character is I suppose meant to be full of various selfish behaviors, but I almost liked the ""change my life"" version worse. One glaring flaw is that she never seems to guess the sex of her attacker despite repeated deaths. Don't expect to much depth from any of the characters, but hey it is a slasher and that is expected.While it was a pleasant slasher, I found no reason I would actually want to hang with the prime character, the sorority girl. Sorry, Jessica Rothe you simply wouldn't be my first choice of friend or date which perhaps is Scott Lobdell's fault. Even when she chooses to ""turn her life around"", I was still left thinking I wouldn't much care to hang with her. The only reason I am saying this is because despite the funny antics and the fun figure it out ""who dun it"" puzzle, Jessica (a.k.a. Tree) cause me not to care near as much about the overall plot. I would actually have found the movie even more entertaining if she failed and was finally killed off if it weren't for the fact that her killer seemed even less appealing.I would recommend watching this movie despite it's drawbacks, it is still quite hilarious.

I have recommended this movie highly - for the genre. It's a much better movie than I thought it would be, and I hope that there are more like this released.

This movie at first instance looks innovating and fresh, but the more forward it goes, the more bored you becomes. The plot looks kind of innovative, a groundhog day meets horror, but the groundhog day premise with different genre is done better with Edge of tomorrow. The comedy in this film is equally awful, and the scares aren't scary enough. It's like someone saw the cabin in the woods and made his own fan fiction with a more serious tone. The characters are blank and offers nothing new. Some of them are there for comic relief but they fail too. The only good thing about this movie is that its pacing is somewhat good, not too slow, not too fast, and also that the premise is not half bad.

But after watching it I came here and I saw the genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller. Seriously? The gerne is a mislead. It was a pathetic horror movie or a lame yet one-time watchable horror comedy, you can pick one. Some says here in the review section like ""expect the unexpected"" or ""Smart movie with depth"" et cetera, that's why I watched this movie. 
I have a good sense to tell who's the murderer, but smart movies can mislead me some times. It' s not a smart horror, I could smell the killer from miles away from the very beggining and I was begging all along ""please be wrong, please be wrong"", but I wasn't. I thaught we live in a century when directors and screenwriters already know how to mislead the audience. I am disappointed.My ""favorite"" scene was when the killer explained why he/ she wanted to kill the poor girl. The explanation was so LAME that I wanted to die instead of her. They ruined pretty much everything in this movie.

I do feel as if this plot could be better projected in a more 'serious' horror story however, it did work well in this context to.

519,jordanwhitten,"A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that will end only when she discovers her killer's identity.",6,29 October 2017,"Happy Death Day Review By Jordan WhittenPlot: A college student must relive the day of her murder over and over again, in a loop that will end only when she discovers her killer's identity.Although the concept and idea was a copy of Groundhog day, it turned out to be a thrilling, mysterious and intense film with loads of drama and action. However, does that make it a good movie? I guess we'll find out more in this review of Happy Death Day.The first thing I will say about this movie is that it is more funnier than scary. So if you're not a big fan of scary horror movies, there is literally nothing to be afraid of. You only encounter really 1 jump scare which is debatably scary, whether you are faint-hearted/timid person you would we quite frightened. The movie Happy Death Day featured the main character Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) and secondary main characters: Carter Davis (Israel Broussard), Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine), and Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken). Without a doubt the acting was great. Few errors were spotted throughout the whole motion picture. So no complaints there.Other than that, the film felt like it was dragging on forever and it was never going to end. Considering it kept showing the same scenes over and over again which gradually got boring. Just when you think Tree might live to the next day, she doesn't, and that could really get you on your nerves and it frustrated me at one point in the movie. However, at the end of the movie when Tree finally discovered who her murderer is, I felt so relieved. After all the build up it all turned out to be quite useful in the end. It made the audience feel ecstatic. The film really keeps you guessing who the murderer is, I think it is an excellent movie in the mystery genre. I urged to discover who the killer was, I think it was it was killing me more than it was killing tree.In conclusion, I personally think the movie is good, not great or amazing but just plain good. There were a couple faults I found in the movie, but there was also some really good things that happened in the film. It also shares some life lessons which is kinda neat. If you are going to see this motion picture, do not expect it to be a full on horror movie that will keep you on your feet. Although it does seem that away in the trailer, it's actually a really fun movie with Jessica Rothe saying a few funny jokes here and there. Happy Death Day is nothing that I expected it to be and I like that, hopefully you do too.Personal Rating: 6.4/10 Is it worth watching: YES",Happy Death Day
520,cwhi-47299,"While flawed, a great film with a surprising ending",9,11 October 2017,"I noticed a few of the reviews on here were posted without those users having actually watched the film.I was lucky enough to go to a preview of the film, and was not disappointed. Starting off pretty slow with unlikeable characters, the film picked up in the best way possible. Throws a few curve balls at you which is always fun. Acting was great across the board - lead did really well in her role. While not the scariest movie, it's definitely entertaining and will keep your adrenaline running.",Happy Death Day
521,dylandodd-68188,Amazing thriller for all ages,10,12 October 2017,Starts off great introducing the story and then BANG a killer comes along and starts the story. The amount of humour was perfect and this movie contained heaps of jump scares. Also the ways she planned to find her killer were good. Another great bit was all the tense moments in this movie that made you want to watch. The acting was so good from all the actors. And the twists at the end made it even better. My new horror favorite will be getting the mask for Halloween. I LOVED THIS MOVIE Aged 12,Happy Death Day
522,livaanson,Funny horror movie worth watching!,8,25 October 2017,"Went to movie theater with low expectations, but this movie surprised me! I would not classify this movie as Horror/Mystery/Thriller, but as a Comedy with horror elements - it was funny, i liked all characters and plot twists. I would definitely recommend watching it – film was executed very well and kept me entertained the whole time!",Happy Death Day
523,moreez,What a trash movie,1,12 August 2018,Jessica Rothe is one of the worst actresses i've ever seen in a movie. The movie itself is bad written and very silly.,Happy Death Day
524,wsimoes,Excellent movie!,10,15 October 2017,"Such a fun movie! More than just a slasher movie, it mixes horror, comedy, romance and sci-fi. It's a great surprise and an excellent revival for slaher movies. Jessica Rothe fits perfectly in the character of Tree. She shines on screen. Congratulations to Blumhouse, delivering another great film.",Happy Death Day
525,steelgeorgie,Happy Death Day,10,17 October 2017,"Happy Death Day, being of quite low budget, was the first movie I saw alone with my friends. It was really funny and had a mix of comedy, drama, and horror. The first death scene was the scariest and all the jump scares were expected but at the same time unexpected. It is a very thought out movie and cliché at times although the reveal of the killer is just mind blowing and twisted. There is not a minute in the movie where you don't rethink the killer is someone else.Jessica Rothe plays the character of Tree very well and you see her character change personality throughout the film. The idea of taking a baby face (the mask for the killer) creates a suspenseful and creepy atmosphere.I think there should be a sequel to this movie as it would make a killer story line and tie in very well with this one. Great movie and would definitely see it again.",Happy Death Day

Boring boring boring boring",Happy Death Day
527,aanndrewhayes,Best movie I've seen in a long time.,10,1 November 2017,"This movie has to be my favorite movie so far. The movie has a really great meaning to it, it's just like Groundhog Day and Scream in one movie. This movie is scary, I loved the feel of the sound effects and stuff. The jump scares were great. After the movie I went home and I could not get to sleep, I actually woke up and thought it was the same day.Overall the movie was the best movie I have ever seen yet.If I could only rate 11/10...........",Happy Death Day
528,isobelhedley,"Big plot twist, unpredictable",10,18 December 2017,"Was really looking forward to this movie but wasn't expecting much to be honest. I'm great for horror and thrillers although there aren't many great ones out there. This one is definitely one I'd recommend. It's scary and intense, really gets you thinking and involved with the story. I love the mystery part, it's also comedic at times which is a great contrast for the gore and violence and it works so well. The actors were fantastic especially the main character.",Happy Death Day
529,tenordblad-47404,Fun times to be had in this not-quite-horror horror movie.,9,12 June 2019,"This movie wasn't really that scary, but it was really cute and pretty funny with its dark comedy. The main actress in particular does a fantastic job.",Happy Death Day
530,tkta,Fun,10,5 August 2018,"This was funny , quirky all around entertaining. A great twist did not expect it .",Happy Death Day
531,ryanchristopher-41102,I didn't really enjoy it.,4,18 January 2018,"When I watched this movie I just felt like everything was too repetitive and that didn't really say why the cycle kept repeating itself. I felt like the story didn't have much structure and that they could have elaborated more on the focus of the story. Also, I feel like they spoonfed the audience way too much.",Happy Death Day

534,thegodlymc,OK SO LET'S MASHUP GROUNDHOG DAY AND FINAL DESTINATION,1,4 May 2018,"Waisted my time so much that I didn't bother to correct my spelling of the word waste. If that time loop occurred, one would not continuously stay in the mostly the same place and doing mostly the same things. Pack up and move to Kansas. She gets to the point where she just starts living how she wants since there literally is no tomorrow. Kind of understandable but knowing you will be killed daily will not allow you to ease your mind to that comfortability. Her farting in from of the guy just makes you roll your eyes until they're stuck. It's 2018. That hasn't been funny since 93'...........1893..................A.D.",Happy Death Day
535,hiboubabekha,love it,10,6 June 2018,"Like it, i had fun watching it alone , nice movie, i like the concept , the acting was amazing and the chemistry between the lead was amazing , nuce movie overall",Happy Death Day
536,donnielapoinde,I don't usually like horror but...,8,12 July 2018,"Every moment of this is fun as heck. Even though I figured out who the murderer was pretty early on, I was totally intrigued by all the little mysteries. And rather than get more boring with each repetition, the movie actually gets funnier and weirder the longer it goes on. The writers really thought through the logic of the premise and made it like a game or puzzle with - so important - a ticking clock. All the performances are so funny and feel at least a little like real college students. If you're looking for thrills that won't fudge you up, definitely give it a go. I loved it!!!",Happy Death Day
537,tjstumpmi,Poor written PC mystery,3,1 November 2019,"This is an overrated ""Ground Hog Day""... Minus the humor, acting, or plot. The nasty sorority girl will change to your BFF after self introspection of being murdered 16 times... This after school special was only missing rainbows and pink ponies. 8 out of 10 on the SJW score. Men are effeminate (the hunk is secretly gay). Global Warming, campus rape (your average male doesnt care its happening in his dorm), are all told from the one sided bigoted liberal point of view...The end has a nice twist and FINALLY a ""bit"" of humor... Thus the 3 out of 10. Good horror movie for school girls",Happy Death Day
