0,Leofwine_draca,Pointless Hollywood comedy,3,21 January 2018,"COLOSSAL is a lame Hollywood comedy that seems to be based around motion capture technology. The premise doesn't hold up for a second and attempts to establish it via childhood flashbacks are merely laughable; you rarely see film writing this bad. The perpetually confused-looking Anne Hathaway plays an obnoxious drunk who's friends with a number of other obnoxious drunks. One day she sees reports of a giant monster terrorising Seoul and realises that she is somehow connected. I love kaiju movies and watched this for the kaiju connection, but other than some admittedly good CGI effects work, this is a completely pointless film bogged down by the irritating protagonists.",Colossal
1,SnoopyStyle,fresh take on the monster movie,7,3 September 2017,"Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is unemployed and often drunk. Her boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) dumps her and kicks her out of his New York apartment. She moves back into her family home and reconnects with childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). She discovers that she is directly connected to a monster destroying Seoul. It's the result of a childhood incident with Oscar twenty five years ago.It's a fun and different take on the monster movie. Hathaway is good. I like Oscar's heel turn. I would rather not tell Joel and Garth about the secret. If it's kept only to Gloria and Oscar, the tension could be much higher. I don't see Joel going along with Oscar's turn. Joel's character could be combined with Tim to make this more of a love triangle. There are some questionable logic with the ending but logic can't be taken seriously in this movie. This has a fresh take and stays compelling despite some bumps along the way.",Colossal
2,claudio_carvalho,"Senseless Story, Awful Characters and Totally Overrated Film",3,6 June 2017,"In New York, the unemployed Gloria (Anne Hathaway) lives with her boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) and spends most of the days and nights drinking with her acquaintances. When Tim breaks with her, he asks Gloria to move away from his apartment and she returns to the empty house that belongs to her parents in her hometown. She meets her schoolmate from the elementary school Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) that offers a waitress position at his bar to her and Gloria befriends his friends Joel (Austin Stowell) and Garth (Tim Blake Nelson). When a giant monster attacks Seoul, in South Korea, the alcoholic Gloria realizes that she is connected to the monster that repeats her movements and she shows to Oscar, Joel and Garth. But soon Oscar finds that he is connected to a giant robot in Seoul and he uses his ability to control Gloria. Soon Gloria finds that Oscar is insane and hates her, and he will destroy Seoul and the inhabitants if Gloria does not do what he wants from her. ""Colossal"" is a totally overrated, mediocre and boring film, with a senseless story and awful characters. The plot gives the sensation that ""Godzilla"" is an art film so imbecile it is. Gloria is an alcoholic vulgar woman that drinks most of the time; Oscar is a wicked and weird character from the very beginning; Joel is a nitwit character and Garth is a cocaine addicted character and all of them spend their time drinking. Tim is an arrogant man. The silly explanation for the connection between Gloria and Oscar and the monster and the robot is ridiculous and maybe satisfies a ten year-old child. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Colossal
3,nogodnomasters,Want to hear an amazing story?,7,5 July 2017,"Gloria (Anne Hathaway) gets booted out of boyfriend's (Dan Stevens) apartment in NYC. She has a drinking problem that creates a monster that devours her soul. She returns to her small home town Mainhead (see Urban dictionary). She gets a job at a bar owned by her elementary school friend (Jason Sudeikis) and is able to continue her favorite past time. When Seoul is attacked by a monster, Gloria is able to strangely connect it to her... never explained, but surely has to do with pair particles, worm holes, and the butterfly effect.The film is build upon metaphors. Clearly Seoul was chosen to be a homonym. The story was fine, but it is not real horror or decent science fiction, it is more akin to fantasy-drama. In order to bring the story the whole tale home, the metaphor needed to be completely developed and not a half way effort. ( Note Wizard of Oz and Gilligan's Island are sloppy metaphors that worked, only because we forgot the metaphor.) Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity (Good for you Anne.)",Colossal
4,kosmasp,Mind over matter,8,12 February 2018,"From the crazy mind that brought us one of the best genre movies (Time Crimes), Nacho goes big or international if you want to call it that. After the Open Windows horror, he gives us the fantastical and a really good cast to boast and go with it too. I understand if some dismiss this as a one shot. A trick pony or whatever else you want to call it.You have to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. The movie is light and fun, but has some serious issues it also adresses. Even though one of the major points is very evident (especially to those who read about the story or saw the trailer), there are things to discover about the crazy mind/ideas Nacho throws our way. I for one am more than sold and even though I wasn't the biggest fan of Open Windows myself, I really loved this one",Colossal
5,jboothmillard,Colossal,6,18 June 2017,"I saw the trailer for this film not long before its release, I thought looked interesting, but I was debating whether or not to actually go and see it, but the critics positive reviews convinced me to do so. Basically Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is an unemployed writer who continually gets drunk, her errant behaviour causes her boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) to break up with her and kick her out of their apartment in New York City, forcing her to move back to her hometown. There Gloria is reunited with childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), who now runs his late father's bar, he brings her a television and other things for her unfurnished house, and she accepts his offer of a job in the bar. But working at the bar does not help Gloria's alcoholism, after each shift she joins Oscar and his friends Garth (Tim Blake Nelson) and Joel (Austin Stowell) hanging out and drinking until morning, Gloria spends the night sleeping in the nearby children's play area. At the same time, a giant reptilian kaiju appears in Seoul, South Korea, creating death and destruction, Gloria sees the footage of the monster on the news, and notices its movements are identical to her's. Gloria realises that when she walks in the playground at 8:05am, she causes the monster to manifest, she reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends, they watch the monster on live news making exactly the same movements as her. But the situation gets more complicated when Oscar steps into the playground, and a gigantic robot manifests in Seoul, Gloria ultimately makes amends for her actions, having caused unintentional chaos, she spells out an apology to be seen by the Seoul people, and she starts to avoid alcohol and the playground. But then Gloria finds out a drunken Oscar is using his avatar to taunt the South Koreans, Oscar is jealous, finding out that Gloria spent the night with Joel, he gets drunk again the next night, inebriated he insults his friends and demands Gloria have a drink, saying he will return to the playground if she doesn't. The next morning, a sobered Oscar apologises to Gloria, but it is clear he wants to continue his control over her, and it gets worse when Tim shows up to see Gloria, Oscar provokes them, setting off a firework in the bar, he explains that no matter how out of control he gets, he knows Gloria will remain under his thumb. A flashback reveals that Gloria and Oscar were struck by lightning in a freak accident, this occurred in the playground while playing with their kaiju and robot action figures, and Gloria realises Oscar acts violently and manipulates her, it is because he hates himself. Gloria intends to leave town with Tim, but Oscar makes good on his threat and returns to the play area, Gloria follows and demands he step out and stop any devastation he plans to cause, they have a brutal fight, which also plays out with their avatars in Seoul, he beats her to the ground, and much of Seoul has been wrecked. Gloria has an idea to stop the destruction, she calls Tim to tell her she can't join him, and takes a plane to South Korea, there at 8:05am, U.S. time, Oscar's robot avatar appears, but Gloria steps out, and her avatar instead appears in the playground. Gloria manages to clutch Oscar, and his avatar, he is aggressive demanding her to let him go, so she throws him off into the distance, causing the giant robot to go flying off and disappear for good, and the monster disappears from America, the curse is broken, relieved she steps into a bar, but lets out a long sigh being offered a drink. Also starring Hannah Cheramy as Young Gloria and Nathan Ellison as Young Oscar. Hathaway is likable as hard-drinking out-of-work party girl who can determine the actions of a Godzilla-like creature, Sudeikis certainly makes for an interesting character, this film is supposed to be funny, it does make you laugh in the right moments mixing the classic monster movie vibe with the 30-something self-discovery story, but there is also a surprising darkness to the movie, with dark demons coming out and creating not just physical monsters, it is a rather weird watch, sure to gain cult status, but a profound and worthwhile science-fiction black comedy. Good!",Colossal
6,ma-cortes,Spectacular Canada/Spain/United States/South Korea co-production well directed by Nacho Vigalondo,7,16 August 2021,"A monster invasion takes place at the known city Seoul in this Sci-Fi/comedy directed by Spanish director Nacho Vigalondo , including massive and gigantic monsters . It contains breathtaking and spectacular scenes with plenty of giant monsters destroying population and cities . Stars an out-of-work girl called Gloria (Anne Hathaway) who is getting kicked out of her flat by her fiancé (Dan Stevens). She is a nice as well as unsettling girl who is forced to leave her life in New York and move back to her hometown. As the picture deals with an amusing situation : what would happen if a monster invasion started while you are at the local home of your infancy and adolescence?. Then news reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, South Korea , and TV breaking news communicate : Please stay calm and remain in your homes .Gloria gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this far-off phenomenon . At the starts she thinks that has gone crazy , and soon after , things go wrong . As happenings to spin out of control, Gloria must solve why her seemingly insignificant life causes overwhelming effects all around the world .The picture relatively succeeds because of the thriller , humor , plot twists , as well as a twisted written script delving into the starring paranoia in such extreme situation . There is a science-fiction premise - in Kaiju monster movie style- have to dominate a story's narrative . Instead it can serve as an interesting backdrop that casts familiar characters in a new light and gives alternative motivations for what would be otherwise commonplace events . The Woody Allen of Science Fiction -as a critic wrote - brings us another amazing film titled ¨Colossal¨ made in a big budget , as the script by Nacho Vigalondo himself manages to be intelligent , intriguing but also a little bit tiring , at times . This is a roller-coaster ride with full of hilarious scenes , sour comedy , monsters , destruction , wreak havoc , chills and impressive scenes . Entertaining moments and frightening amusement when monsters show up causing extreme mayhem , confusion , fright and apocalypse . As World is plunged into chaos upon the appearance of giant monsters , while authorities send useless defence forces to destroy them . Fantastic design of the enormous creatures , being well and competently made by means of state-of-the-art special effects . The film contains a lot of visual effects shots , with over-the-top 3-D models of monsters . Following a similar vein in Nacho Vigalondo's Time crimes (2006) , and other recent film titled Extraterrestre (2011) , examines the fallout and chaos on the context of a weird invasion . The same kind of issues are told and the same rash decisions made to cover up the mystery , but the paranoia of our starring is so huge so that she has to determine why her existence gets such a colossal effect on the fate of the world. The final result is an offbeat dramedy that's captivating , in spite of not being all that fun or especially thought-provoking . The good thing about this film is that the director made it on a budget enough , having to do some great Korean sets , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . Casting is frankly well , giving fine performances as the attractive starring Anne Hathaway heightens every emotion and lends comedy to some situations where there'd be none . She's well accompanied by a good cast , such as : Jason Sudeikis , Austin Stowell , Tim Blake Nelson and Dan Stevens .Adding a thrilling and moving musical score by Bear McCreary . Equally , a colorful and appropriate cinematography by Eric Kress . This motion picture was tautly written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo in his second movie , his first was the international hit titled ¨Time crimes¨ with Karra Errejalde . Nacho is a good young filmmaker , a little prolific director because he is usually writer for television and shorts filmmaker , he has only realized four films including ¨Open windows¨ with Elijah Wood , Sasha Grey , ¨Extraterrestrial¨ with Michelle Jenner and segment films as ¨V/H/S Viral : segment Parallel Monsters"" and ¨The ABCs of Death¨ . This ¨Colossal¨ is without a doubt a weird , mysterious and comedy film to be liked for Science-Fiction and comedy fans , turning out to be one of the most original movies of the last years , though inferior its predecessor ¨Time crimes¨. Rating : 6.5/10. Acceptable and decent movie .",Colossal
7,BA_Harrison,Quirky.,5,21 May 2017,"Party girl Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is kicked out by her long-suffering boyfriend, and so returns to her home town where her parents own a vacant house; there she is reunited with old school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) who now owns a bar, which acts like a magnet to boozy Gloria. Meanwhile, in Seoul, South Korea, a massive monster appears and trashes the city. When Gloria recognises some of the monster's movements and mannerisms to be the same as her own, she realises that she is somehow in control of the creature.A fantasy/sci-fi parable about the destructive nature of alcoholism and the acceptance of responsibility, with random observations about the detached manner in which international disasters are viewed by the masses, Colossal is what might best be described as 'quirky'. Sometimes I like quirky, but in this instance it just didn't work for me, largely because I found the central characters so unlikable, reckless Gloria unworthy of our sympathy and Oscar a controlling psychotic with a serious case of self-loathing. When Gloria finally takes control of her life, preventing Oscar from more mindless destruction, it is done so with deadly force—and this is supposed to be a happy ending.5/10—different, but not particularly enjoyable.",Colossal
8,Theo Robertson,Surely The Director Can Do Better Than This ?,4,2 May 2017,"As soon as I saw the name Nacho Vigalondo I knew I had to catch this movie. The director wrote, directed and starred in 7.35 IN THE MORNING a short involving twisted desire, jet black comedy and one of the most memorable irritating catchy tunes it has been my pleasure to hear. 7.35 is one of these short films that leaves you gasping ""What a simple brilliant idea , I wish I'd thought of that"". Unsurprisingly Vigalondo went on to have a have a prolific and successful career. The downside is that his career is in Spanish language cinema and which means his material is rather difficult to get in Britain. Since COLOSSAL is English language featuring a bunch of Hollywood faces I quickly took the opportunity to see it , but having seen it I've got to ask is that it ? A few people have praised COLOSSAL for its quirky nature. It's true that it has that quirky , independent feel and I've no doubt Nacho is a quirky , delightfully bonkers guy in real life but as both cinema and coherent narrative COLOSSAL falls short. I suppose you can call it a mixed genre film with a plot line involving human drama on one hand and sci-fi/horror spectacular on the other but the two aspects never gell. There is an explanation of sorts connecting the two plot lines but not in any deep meaningful manner. Just because something is explained and tries to be absurdist you still have to develop the story in order to convince the audience and any sort of internal logic didn't convince me here. The human elements of the story are somewhat boring and you constantly feel like you're watching people viewing stuff on social media. In short it's a major disappointment from someone who made one of the greatest short films I've ever seen",Colossal
9,CinemaSerf,Well it's certainly a colossal something...,6,26 December 2020,"Usually when you see that Dan Stevens (he of the piercing eyes) is in something, you know to expect anything from quirky to downright surreal - and this story falls roughly between the two. I can't say I understood all of it - but essentially it's about bullying: physical and psychological, and uses some clever connectivity with Kaiju avatars to relate parts of the story with the remainder being carried out in a bar where the rather unpleasant Anne Hathaway (""Gloria"") is conducting a battle of wills with ""Oscar"" (Jason Sudeikis) having left the loveable Mr. Stevens after he got sick of her drunken sponging behaviour and dumped her. The characterisations are as flawed at the characters they represent and that doesn't help the cohesion of the story. It has a start (largely told via continuing flashbacks) - I got that; and an ending which delivers just desserts on those deserving; but the middle is a void. We jump from stage one to stage three of the plot with scant guidance on how? Hathaway and Stevens' personas change quite profoundly - but I didn't really know why, or how. Sudeikis' presents us with a degree of compelling obnoxiousness that would have driven his own mother away - but.... There are metaphors a plenty and on the whole the message from the story - which, incidentally, is about as romantic as the Great Escape - seems to illustrate the potential of inner strengths in the face of seemingly challenging, frequently violent, odds. I've seen it twice - a fair shot, methinks - and I would recommend you give it a go - but beware; it is nothing remotely like the trails...",Colossal
10,FlashCallahan,"She's the monster, I'm the robot.....,",5,8 May 2017,"Gloria is out-of-work who, after getting kicked out of her apartment by her boyfriend, is forced to leave her life in New York and move back to her hometown. When news reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, Gloria gradually comes to the realisation that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon. As events begin to spiral out of control, Gloria must determine why her seemingly insignificant existence has such a colossal effect on the fate of the world......It's the age old tale of a hometown girl who moves back to her humbling beginnings and her metaphorical demons become literal. The only thing is, they only come to fruition when she is in a certain place at a certain time.The trailers were very deceptive in advertising this as an all out comedy. In fact, the film is nothing more than a 'Mumblecore' film with some cut scenes of monsters fighting.Take away the monsters and this would be the same film, but the film would focus more on alcoholism and the effects of withdrawal when your intake goes far beyond that of the recommended daily units advised.So the majority of the film is the cast sitting in a closed bar, drinking and saying a lot of improvised dialogue. Hathaway and Sudiekis are good, but their past and the rationale for there behaviour is never fully explained, only hinted at.Dan Stevens pops up as the Ex-boyfriend, who throws her out and then starts calling her to make sure she is okay, another pointless sub-plot that never gets fully explained.I'm sure somewhere in the boring narrative, there is a warning about the dangers of excess, as there are a few times that Hathaway does suffer from short term memory, but that is explained rather flimsily as the times when she is elsewhere occupied.Maybe the monsters are a metaphor for Korsakoff dementia, but either way, it's very boring.Maybe a few beers would help it to be more entertaining?",Colossal
11,deloudelouvain,"I thought it was going to be good, but it's quite the opposite.",4,4 December 2017,"Well the least I can say is that I'm absolutely not impressed by this movie. The story is beyond ridiculous that you wonder how they came up with that. Not that I don't like some strange stories or so, on the contrary, but this one is really too stupid. And it's not even well executed. About the cast you would think that with Jason Sudeikis and Anne Hathaway you would have some kind of good acting but even that was too much to ask. The acting was just average, nothing that you will ever remember. But the biggest issue is just the story, that's a fact. If I were you I would never start watching Colossal because it will be a waste of your time. There are way better movies than this one.",Colossal
12,namashi_1,"Strange, Innovative & Interesting!",7,4 May 2017,"'Colossal' brings a genre defying turn to the world of Sci-Fi and blends it with comic touches. This Human/Monster movie is Strange, Innovative & Interesting! While it may not cater to all, considering its risky story-structure, but those who are ready to wait & enjoy the ride, are sure to be rewarded. 'Colossal' Synopsis: Gloria (A TERRIFIC Anne Hathaway) is an out-of-work party girl forced to leave her life in NY and move back home. When reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, she gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon.Director and Writer Nacho Vigalondo delivers a film on many themes, mainly on the actions we take & how they reflect our surroundings. The Sci-Fi & getting the Monster thing in, is a rather clever way to put up a message that's strong & timely. The Protagonist here, Gloria, is a wreck & can certainly be a better person, and she, oddly enough, realizes that when her Monster version shows up in Seoul. Nacho's Writing takes time to grab your attention, but once the Monster blasts up the Screen, you get glued to your seats & will likely not move thereafter. The twist in the narrative is interesting & the culmination, is simply superb. What's interesting here is how Human a story 'Colossal' is, even though its USP is its Monster. And that's where Nacho wins as a Writer & Director. He makes the human-conflict engrossing & the Monster angle, amusing & attention-grabbing. Nacho's Innovative Screenplay is definitely among the most daring ones we've come across this year & his Direction, too, is competent all through.Eric Kress's Cinematography is another Ace. The lens-man's work here is of superior quality. Ben Baudhuin & Luke Doolan's Editing is pretty crisp in parts. Some crispiness in its initial parts seem missing, though! Art & Costume Design are well-done. Graphics are top-notch.Performance-Wise: Anne Hathaway is a show-stopper. The Oscar-Winning Actress gets into the skin of Gloira & portrays her with realism. Her Performance is among the top merits of 'Colossal'. Supporting her in a rather dramatic turn, Jason Sudeikis is a pleasant surprise, in a role that has grey shades. Sudeikis proves here that he's more than your regular funny man & I hope Hollywood does him proud.On the whole, 'Colossal' is daringly original & undeniably engaging. Grab a huge tub of popcorn & enjoy the ride!",Colossal
13,blanbrn,A film of connection and memory it shows how fate comes full circle!,8,16 May 2017,"""Colossal"" is one of those movies that's a little different yet it does it's job about proving it's point and message to show how that life and things connect and come about all around the world. Anne Hathaway is Gloria a New York city party girl who's an alcoholic and after losing her job moves back home and meets childhood friend Oscar(Jason Sudeikis)and memories are brought back to the playground days of when both had imagination and good times with their toys one being a creature monster toy. Now oddly enough a creature like this toy is now real and attacking South Korea. And as each attack happens it's like Gloria and Oscar connect and can control the creature and it's happenings. Now talk about things and fate coming full circle! Finally Gloria finishes it off being the hero of the day as her memory and imagination help settle the score and she's free of Oscar! Overall good film of connection, and it proves how the past returns and it's a showcase how one can defeat a challenge and start a new life.",Colossal
14,lasttimeisaw,a strong feminist manifesto of a woman's own freestanding ritual of finding back her mojo,7,24 July 2017,"The fourth feature of Spanish genre-bucking filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo (whose debut film TIMECRIMES 2007 is a mind-boggling wheeze on time-loop), COLOSSAL is a shaggy-dog story which marries a woman's striving for temperance and getting her life back on track in the middle America with a kaiju's mysterious manifestation in the hub of Seoul, the telekinetic synchrony of their actions flouts any rationale but it is an ingenious premise to tickle audience's interest.Gloria (Hathaway), a jobless writer has a drinking problem, is unceremoniously dumped by her piqued boyfriend Tim (Stevens) and has to move back to her hometown. She touches base with her childhood friend Oscar (Sudeikis), who is congenial enough to offer her a job as a barista in the bar where he has inherited from his father, although it isn't a perfect option for a woman who tries to dry out, but a woman needs to survive, Gloria takes the offer. When a Brobdingnagian monster repeatedly materializes in Seoul at the exact same place and same time (8:05 a.m. in Gloria's time zone) and afterward vaporizes into the thin air, a personal tic triggers off Gloria's curiosity and following a simple experiment it certifies that the monster is actually her avatar: if she walks into a playground nearby exactly at that time, the monster will simultaneously appear in Seoul and whatever she does during that special spatio-temporal frame, the monster will follow suit, which means it can wreak disproportionate havoc to the city of Seoul. If that is the case, why not staving off from the magic playground at that particular time, everything will be easy-breezy. Nevertheless, the plot thickens when Oscar steps in, it turns out that a giant robot is his remote avatar, Gloria must thereby handle with care of their increasingly passive-aggressive relation especially after she spends a romantic evening with their common friend Joel (Stowell), because it seems that Oscar is enamored with her, or is he? What follows is a rather unexpected change of gear, the movie's light-hearted backbone and absurdity subsides when Oscar lets rip his domineering bearing over Gloria by threatening to rampage Seoul if she disobeys, and more upsettingly, there is no specific reason behind his transgression, it is not that he is driven by jealousy or a past grudge, it is just his complexion, a self-hater who takes insidious pleasure in making other's lives miserable, which essentially stems from his own unhappiness, stuck in a dead-water life in a small town. As a barkeeper, there is not much deal he can bargain, but now, possessed with the destructive superpower, he has the leverage to hector Gloria into subservience, and it is not difficult to detect its mordant connotations pertaining to today's reality (an egoist's bullying culture) and a slightly offensive sideswipe at small-town dweller's low self-esteem. How can Gloria defeat this man-demon in her own way without a third-party's involvement (its shoe-string budget doesn't allow it)? Vigalondo again proves his innovativeness (with a junket trip to Seoul as its rewarding divvy) in the genre storytelling, after a convenient memory recovery of what instigates their avatar's presence in Seoul in the first place, which happened 25 years ago when both Gloria and Oscar were school-kids (a cheap CGI of thunderclaps is a requisite for the scenario), Gloria outsmarts Oscar with a deus ex machina (which has no logic groundings but story-wise, an emboldening maneuver) and triumphantly humbles her indomitable nemesis. In toto, gingered up by two outstanding performances from Hathaway and Sudeikis, in particular the latter's gradual metamorphosis from a goody-goody to an obnoxious sadist, COLOSSAL shores up a strong feminist manifesto of a woman's own freestanding ritual of finding back her mojo, against its built-in limits in rounding out its yarn of incredulity.",Colossal
15,Hellmant,One of the most original and creative films I've seen in years!,9,2 August 2017,"'COLOSSAL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie sci-fi dark comedy about an alcoholic unemployed, newly single, writer (in America) that discovers she's unconsciously causing a monster to attack Seoul, South Korea. The movie was written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo; who's also performed both duties on the 2014 indie horror flick 'OPEN WINDOWS', as well as segments in the horror anthologies 'V/H/S VIRAL' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH'. The film stars Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, Austin Stowell and Tim Blake Nelson. It was made on a budget of just $15 million, and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be extremely weird, unpredictable and totally fascinating.Gloria (Hathaway) is an alcoholic unemployed writer, who lives with her boyfriend Tim (Stevens) in a New York City apartment. That is until Tim gets sick of her constantly getting drunk, and he decides to kick her out of his place. So Gloria moves back to her hometown, in middle America. Once there she runs into her old childhood friend Oscar (Sudeikis), who gives her a job at his bar waitressing. Gloria continues to get wasted after work, with Oscar and his friends (Stowell and Nelson). She then walks home through a playground every morning, at 805. She later discovers that her movements, while walking through the playground at this time, cause a giant kaiju monster to materialize (in Seoul, South Korea) and imitate her actions. This is causing lots of death and destruction there. Gloria struggles to learn how to deal with this, as well as all of her other problems.The movie is one of the most original and creative films I've seen in years! Anne Hathaway has likened it to 'BEING JOHN MALKOVICH'; and I think it's definitely just as crazy, weird and unpredictable. I had absolutely no idea where it was going, at any time, and I absolutely couldn't turn it off (even though I desperately needed some sleep). I've liked Vigalondo's other work, but this is definitely a step above. I can't say what I feel about the overall message of the movie, because I'm still trying to digest it and figure it out, but it's definitely a must see in my opinion.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8sMDCYeQGPU",Colossal
16,cherold,Fascinating and Surprising,8,11 August 2017,"When I heard about this movie, in which a woman realizes she is somehow connected to a giant monster decimating Seoul, I had to see it. It was just such a clever idea. But what makes this movie so terrific is how it goes beyond that clever gimmick to create something surprisingly real and convincing.The movie begins (rather slowly) as hard partying Gloria is kicked out of her boyfriend's apartment. She decides to go back to her hometown and live in her parent's vacant house. After a night of drinking with an old friend, she wakes up to learn a Godzilla-like monster has attacked Seoul. And she begins to realize that somehow, her life is connected to the attack.My first take was that this was a movie about Gloria's emotional destructiveness. It's an easy assumption to make, yet Gloria seems fairly nice and somewhat self-aware, which doesn't really fit.As the movie progresses, I realized that it was refusing to be boxed in that tightly. Colossal is about a number of different things, and rather than being a movie about Anne's destructiveness it is more about the nature of toxic relationships and the need to look at your life.That sounds pretty weighty, so I'll just throw in here that the movie is often quite funny, with a likable Anne Hathaway as the partier.I can understand how this movie would throw some people off. Even cross-genre films rarely are this crossed, and personal indie dramedies aren't a natural fit with monster movies. But it works beautifully.It should be said that those who expect some sort of persuasive explanation for this will be left wanting. The movie is closer in concept to a fairy tale than a sci-fi movie, and the attempt near the end to explain it all would probably work better if it involved a spell cast by an evil sorcerer. But I'm okay with that, because this isn't a sci-fi movie, this is small drama telling its story in a unique, original fashion. It's the sort of movie that stays with me in a way most movies don't. Now I need to see some more movies by this writer/director.",Colossal
17,Robert_duder,The film everybody wants that not many will like,7,23 August 2017,"For decades now I've been a movie fanatic. I will watch literally almost anything. My reviews will prove that. It's been awhile since I saw and Indie flick and I remember seeing trailers for this and thinking it looked interesting but also knowing what to expect being an indie film. I assumed it would be a little off the wall and bizarre and it is exactly that. But how often do we hear movie goers complain that Hollywood is not original and there are no good stories out there (ironically the film was sued for being too much like Godzilla) but the concept of the film is very unique. It transitions from comedy to drama to action/sci-fi throughout the film almost flawlessly. You could tune into this movie at any given time and not know what genre you were watching. The film could easily be dissected into a morality tale about emotions and self-confidence and life decisions. The script is not amazing and has some pacing issues but the film is saved from monotony but it's main two stars. The fact that the film ends up taking itself so seriously is a testament on how much they want you invested in it. I presume it was quite low budget but the special effects are strong despite a few moments of terrible looking fire. I'm also not sure I understand the underlying story of what happened to them when they were kids. But the movie is unique enough and well acted to entertain.If you were going to find someone to headline a potentially bizarre film you'd get one of the world's finest and they did that in Anne Hathaway. Few would doubt her acting chops but also her ability to be relatable and believable and show serious emotion. She is subtle and wonderful as down on her luck server Gloria who feels like she is in a rut. Hathaway gives this such a quirky little spin but ends up being the perfect heroine too. I was blown away by the performance of Jason Sudekis. He actually gives what I would think the Academy would consider an Oscar Worthy performance as the man who draws her into a deadly game of control and emotional abuse in some sense that manifests itself as a battle between two massive creatures in Korea. Sudekis is disturbing in some sense and he and Hathaway are great together. Austin Stowell, Tim Blake Nelson and Dan Stevens are okay as Sudekis' friends but they're solely unnecessary to be honest. They serve a purpose to show a dark side of Sudekis but outside of that they don't get a chance to give any sort of performance.Nacho Vigalondo has had some success in some extremely indie horror flicks that gained a cult following. I think I saw some parts of them. He also wrote Colossal and he definitely shows some talent. I think he has a lot of learn and the film could have used some experience and some fine tuning. All that being said if you like indie films and you really want to see something different. Colossal is that! I enjoyed it in all it's quirkiness. 7/10",Colossal

'Colossal (2017)' also takes a while to get going, but once it does it is consistently enjoyable and somewhat subversive, if a little unmemorable, especially once the more sinister machinations come into play - which are bolstered by an excellently menacing performance by Jason Sudeikis. 7/10",Colossal
19,bowmanblue,Strangely addictive,7,1 April 2018,"The term 'car-crash' normally means something that's really bad and yet you can't bring yourself to look away. I think it would be a little unfair to refer to 'Colossal' as a 'car-crash' of a film, because it's not bad at all, in fact, it's rather touching and uplifting, but I certainly couldn't stop myself from watching, even though I have to confess I'm not entirely sure of the point.Thinking about it, I do wonder how commercially successful it was because I can't really think of the target audience it was supposed to be aimed at. If you've seen any of the marketing material surrounding it, you may well have spotted the prominent monsters crashing through major world cities. In the light of the 'Pacific Rim' movies you may well be expecting an action blockbuster, but you would be well off the mark with that one. Also, prominently featured in the film's posters is its star Anne Hathaway smiling and looking a little bit kookie. This almost makes the film come across as a happy-go-lucky comedy, maybe with a romantic element contained within? Again, well wrong.In fact, it's almost hard to explain about the film's plot without giving too much away. Anne Hathaway plays a struggling alcoholic who gets caught up in a much larger matter (pun intended) regarding giant monsters crashing through a city on the other side of the world. How are these two situations connected? Well, you'll have to watch the film to find out.I will say that the film doesn't give a clear and cut explanation to everything it's presented the audience with, but it gives you enough to allow you to fill in the blanks yourself with (film) logic. What you get is actually a drama about an alcoholic struggling with her demons and those around her that wish to either help or hinder her. Yes, there are also giant monsters in there, too.As long as you expect drama first and sci-fi second, you should enjoy it. There's not much here in the way of humour or action, so certainly don't hold out for anything that remotely resembles 'Pacific Rim.' As I said, I don't know who the target audience for this is, only that I enjoyed it and found that I was definitely rooting for Anne Hathaway's character and found her a flawed, yet endearing hero.",Colossal
20,dromasca,ridiculously entertaining,7,19 May 2017,"Here is a very strange combination. Actually let me formulate this as a question. Can a team of film makers take a completely ridiculous 'kaiju' (Japanese monster) story, combine it with a sweet and teary romantic story, and make out of the combination of the two an entertaining movie? The answer is yes, the name of the film is Colossal, written and directed by the Spaniard director Nacho Vigalondo at his second film in the American studios.Monster stories are usually laughable. This one is so unbelievable that I will not spend any time analyzing it. The script takes no pain in making it otherwise, and no efforts were made either for creating special effects that would be any better than the ones in the classical Japanese or American movies of the genre from the 60s or 70s. There is a romantic story here, about an alcoholic messy girl (Anne Hathaway) returning twenty years or so later to her small, frozen in time childhood city, after breaking with her boyfriend in New York, meeting a former elementary school colleague, and trying to make sense of her life. And than, while she gets even messier and more drunk, strange things start to happen. None of these are bright and convincing, and yet the combination works.What is the secret? It may be in Anne Hathaway's acting, or maybe in her eyes, the biggest on big screens since Goldie Hawn. Her counterpart - Jason Sudeikis as the bar owner Oscar who ends in a very different place than where he starts - provides also a nice acting performance. It may be in the touch of humor that makes the unbelievable seem ... well ... reasonable? It may be in the fact that there is a touch of humanity and emotion that is being added to all the incredible events taking place on screen. It may be to the fact that the rules of the horror genre are never taken too much in serious and that they are so barely and rudely exposed that they invite the viewers to understand that this is just another story about monsters made of clothes or paper and cities made of wrapping boxes. It may be the combination of all these, or something else, but whatever it is, the film is very watchable, odd, and funny.",Colossal
21,ThomasDrufke,Anne Hathaway Controls a Kaiju. What More Could You Ask For?,8,25 April 2017,"I'll always give props to movies that are original and/or take refreshing approaches to a certain genre. Colossal bends the indie sci-fi genre on its head and gives us one of Anne Hathaway's best performances of her career. It's not for everyone, but 'Colossal' is one of the most interesting and unique films you'll see all year.What's really promising about a film like this is that actors like Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis signed up. This boasts particularly well for future indie films with similar ambitions. When films that deal with a drunk homeless woman controlling a Kaiju monster across the world do well critically, it definitely means good things for the film business. I guess the real test will be how the film fares at the box office.Hathaway plays Gloria, a drunk who finds herself back in her hometown after being kicked out of her boyfriend's home, only to realize she's somehow controlling a dangerous Kaiju in Seoul, South Korea. Quite the premise, huh? It's far from different or strange, this film is downright bizarre. In a good way, of course. The film shifts tones several times, deals with mass destruction of cities and plenty of casualties, and a main character with a serious alcohol addiction, but the film never strays away from its goofy premise. In other words, the film does an unusually good job of balancing drama and comedy. If I had to give this film a designation, I'd say it's a mixture of 'Rachel Getting Married' and 'Pacific Rim'.I would highly recommend going into this film knowing next to nothing. Don't watch any trailers, TV spots, or read any plot descriptions. Heck, if you're still reading this, stop and go see the film first. I know it's difficult in today's age of Hollywood to avoid everything, but I didn't watch or read anything and I was thrilled with the end result. This especially applies to where the film goes in the second act and on. I certainly did not expect the film to take the direction it did with a few characters and ultimately the ending.Just as a fan of sci-fi and original films alone, 'Colossal' is a triumph for film. Does it get a little bit too goofy and convoluted at times? Sure. But it's one heck of a ride I didn't expect to be taking. That's not exactly what I would say about most films these days.

22,A_Different_Drummer,Delightful 'Absurdist' Film -- Hathaway Soars,8,28 April 2017,"In my many of my prior reviews I have ""beaten the drum"" on one particular theme -- namely, that back in the days before CGI and the studios' ravenous hunger for new franchises to monetize indefinitely, films worked based on the ability of the director and the stars to ""connect"" with the audience.One word. Connection. But the implications can be astounding.Colossal, for example, reminded me of 1966's Georgy Girl, oddly also a story about a young girl whose Life needs a complete remake, and she more or less has to start over from scratch.Georgy Girl was a major hit in the 1960s -- without any sci-fi elements or SFX -- because, somewhere around the 5 minute mark, everyone in the theatre, even the guys, began to identify with the character. In other words, connection. Once you have connection, anything is possible.Recommended. Sit back. Think of times in your own life when all four wheels fell off the wagon. Enjoy it.And pay special attention to Hathaway's wonderful performance. For an A-list star who was weaned in the Disney studio, and held her own against Batman, she dons a hairdo that looks like it was done by a local vet ... and then proceeds to sell the role so effectively that, after a while, you honestly wonder if anyone else could have played the lead?",Colossal
23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,31 July 2017,"ColossalThe best thing about giant monsters is that they never attack landlocked cities.However, the damage done by the kaiju in this dramedy is affecting Middle America. Twenty-five years after a colossal reptile attacked Seoul, an alcoholic writer, Gloria (Anne Hathaway), heads back home to her small-town to detox. Unfortunately, her childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) owns a bar where he and his friends (Tim Blake Nelson, Austin Stowell) congregate.After a night off the wagon, Gloria wakes to news that the monster has returned to terrorize Korea. Later, she realizes its rampaging mirrors her every movement.Giant monster movie ethos mixed with the intimate character studies, depressing themes and subtle performances of an Independent film, this unique hybrid balances a bizarre line between dark humour and senseless destruction with aplomb, never favouring one strange narrative over the other.Incidentally, an alcoholic controlling a giant monster means more pee breaks.

During first half an hour I believed I'll give up any minute now. But somehow I found myself completely pulled in the story which caught me unprepared for what it brings. Forget about trailers and what you heard about genre and story and enter this adventure without any prejudice. It's the only way. Any expectation will only bring you disappointment while if you have none you are in for pleasant surprise. IMDb says action-comedy which is nonsense. Technically this is SF drama, essentially it's black-humorous allegory. Story is very original. It's told plain and simple and to audience, accustomed to popular complicated scenarios with plenty of surprises and twists, it may seem boring. But to me it was welcome refreshment and example how even with little can be shown a lot.

25,851222,Underrated,8,30 August 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.I found ""Colossal"" (2016) much more interesting, dark and deep then i thought i will be after reading a premise. This isn't your typical comedy staring Jason Sudeikis - it isn't funny movie, except if you are looking for some very dark comedy. Premise here looks like from a mind of Spike Jonze of Charlie Kaufman. Although it isn't as brilliant as those two might have made this movie - i loved the story overall and movie itself. Ovreall, ""Colossal"" is a kinda fresh take on a premise. There is a very dark humor down below, but i enjoyed it very much in a first place because of very solid writing, pacing (at running time 1 h 43 min this movie never dragged) and not by ""a numbers"" movie.

26,westsideschl,Your Demons,8,12 August 2017,"It's been a while since I've had to know my literary devices so I'll guess this script is fairly close to an allegory in which the demons (evils) in people are represented by our two monsters. Several self actuating demons are shown such as addiction, but the evil of advancing self over others (literally stepping all over others for self gratification) was the most salient to me. One of the first scenes in this film is when one of the adult characters in a flashback as a grade/middle school student tramples over the class project of another student. Their projects contain the elements (as action figures and city models) for the reality to follow. To further this connection is a Zeus (or some other classical deity) like thunderbolt that strikes that student (Gloria, e.g..Hathaway) in the head during her rage at seeing her project trampled thus bringing the demons to life. Lots of symbolism in this, at times, comedic tragedy so easy to lose focus on deeper meanings and to feel for the characters (by design). But, kudos for creative unusual storytelling once you figure it out",Colossal
27,tabuno,A Daringly Different Fantasy Drama,8,11 January 2019,"16 April 2017. Some of the audience has seen this side of Ann Hathaway before in Rachel Getting Married (2008). This fantasy drama with its misleading trailer depicting a comedy sci fi action movie takes some getting used to as the comedy only comes in little bits but with the best, memorable one second shot seen saved for the very end. This daring fusion of Asian monster movie and relational drama offers Ann Hathaway another performance allowing her to demonstrate her dramatic chops along with the more dour side of excessive alcohol consumption as a much more mysterious past.The characters in this movie are somewhat shallow, yet it is also this very authentic shallowness that makes for the realistic tinge that permeates this movie. The portrayals in this movie also allow the audience to understand how domestic violence, petty alcoholic arguments and emotional rejection can sometimes lead to literally gigantic consequences as presented in this movie. Not has strange and outlandish as Donnie Darko (2001), nevertheless, Colossal offers a more intimate clash between lovers or potential lovers, jealousy, rejection, and past traumas instead of journey into the darkness of one's own inner soul. In a way, Colossal could be compared to Rachel Weisz's character's sister in the horror classic Constantine (2005) had stuck around and both sisters were connected throughout the movie in a state of doppelganger relationship through the movie or a dramatic relational version of Peter O'Toole's horror movie Phantoms (1998). This movie oddly enough is a softer version of the subtle shudder horror shrouded Nomads (1986), a rarely cited cool reference.",Colossal
28,Reno-Rangan,A tale of two cities!,8,24 November 2017,"Did not expect it. It was a unique film. I love such films, because I'm bored of the same old action, romance, horror, thrillers. But it had loads of flaws. It was hard to get rid of them. Even I thought without those flaws, there's no tale to tell. In the end, entertainment matter and this film provided that without logics. So put aside your adult brain and enjoy it like a kid.I had not seen the teaser, trailer and never heard the storyline before trying it. I just went and sat, the initial parts were not that impressive. Because returning the hometown is a common cliché. Though once the story had taken a twist, the rest of the narration changed completely. Well, the story is about the two cities and each city split into a black comedy and a disastrous theme.An unemployed and alcoholic young woman returns hometown after break up with her boyfriend. Befriends an old friend, and starts anew life. Until she discovers that on the other side of the world, a giant monster wrecking up a city. Once again, she discovers that she had something to do with that. Following it, how her response reshapes the entire episode was told with a twist at the end.Anne Hathaway was simply good. But not to forget Jason Sudeikis' part too. Both of them controlled the narration. This is a film to have fun. Not to go after errs. A film with the giant monsters, but less graphics used. Very clever writing by the Spanish filmmaker known for some good titles. I think the film is a little underrated. Recommended for those who seek nothing but an entertainment.8/10",Colossal

While I agree, the film is quite different and has a very ""Sundance/film festival, anti-mainstream crowd"" appeal, Colossal is quite bizarre and not what was expecting. Having no expectations from the film and forgetting about the trailer, opinion was none extinct. The film is quite silly and not sure what it was intended of being. A comedy, a drama, a monster movie? Overall the film's plot is overall bizarre and didn't make much sense.The characters aren't too likable either. Anne Hathaway is usually appealing and easy to root for but in this film is either too over the top (although still engaging to watch). As for Jason Sudeikis, his character is introduced and is quite calm and normal, then suddenly towards the end part, goes berserk and starts off behavior.The ending is quite different and okay but overall the second half comes off as bizarre and not in a great way.

30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Unique premise and thoughtful message crumbles beneath nonsensical plot, character motivations",4,8 August 2017,"Part giant monster movie, part cliché indie about a defeated successful city-dweller returning to her small town, ""Colossal"" aims to be something quirky and innovative that will eventually settle down to say something real. Nacho Vigalondo (""Timecrimes"") knowingly creates a completely implausible story hoping that his thematic intentions and the charms of stars Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis will hold it all together. As admirable as his effort may be, the scattered, illogical story makes ""Colossal"" too difficult to follow and connect with to have a vested interest in the outcome.Nothing is wrong with a far-flung premise, even the notion of Hathaway's mentally unraveling character Gloria realizing that if she steps onto a specific playground in her old hometown at 8:05 a.m., she's causing a giant monster to materialize in Seoul, South Korea, and her movements control its actions. The way Vigalondo plays out that premise, however, has some downright confounding elements.Gloria's return home comes after her boyfriend (Dan Stevens) has kicked her out for disappearing acts that involve binge-drinking, and she reunites with an old friend, Oscar (Sudeikis) who runs a bar and helps get Gloria situated in her parents' vacant house. Once Gloria discovers her connection to the Seoul monster, she lets Oscar and his buddies in on the secret, which somehow leads to a slowly and sinisterly escalating conflict between them.In theory -- and in fairness to a good extent in practice too – there's a clever metaphor at work here about our ""colossal"" ****-ups and how these choices can have devastating impacts on those around us that we often fail to notice. In many respects, ""Colossal"" is a movie about how we choose to respond once we recognize the consequences of our destructive actions and Gloria and Oscar represent different responses.Some viewers will receive that message clear as a bell, but for the balance of audiences who look to connect with characters first before buying into a well-constructed metaphor, ""Colossal"" will be a title thrown back at this film attached to words like ""headache"" or ""waste of time."" The diagnosis can be attributed to Vigalondo's narrow focus on Gloria and Oscar's role in this high concept rather than nurturing and developing them as complete characters for their own sake.Gloria and Oscar aren't two-dimensional, but they lack any semblance of character motivation. They drunkenly stumble into this plot in every sense. Once Gloria makes the decision to go home, it's unclear whether she just wants to ride out the storm and hope her boyfriend will take her back, discover what she wants from life, treat this homecoming as a fresh start or a distraction – and then the monster discovery happens, diverting all her attention. Hathaway already has an unfairly maligned reputation as an unlikable actress, and she continues to take roles that do her no favors, though by the end she finds herself in the role of hero.The evolution of her relationship with Oscar makes even less sense. Vigalondo dangles a secret from their past in front of us to keep us in suspense, suggesting that this secret might illuminate the inexplicably strange and ever-stranger interactions between them, but nothing solves the problem of not understanding where either of them is coming from in the film's final act.""Colossal"" has that imaginative, almost ""Twilight Zone""-esque premise that many moviegoers, myself included, usually can't help but fall for, yet the motivation, conflict and methodology of this movie are in such disarray that it hampers the depth of its insights. All it needed was a few more key moments of common sense and clarity to allow its message to resonate. Instead, we receive that message in a direct, emotionless way. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

31,paul-allaer,And now for something different and original...,8,29 April 2017,"""Colossal"" (2016 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Gloria. As the movie opens, we see a little Korean girl looking for her lost doll in a park, only to be confronted by a giant monster. Then we go ""25 Years Later"" and we get to know Gloria, a wanna-be writer in New York who drinks too much and has boyfriend problems. Tim, the angry boyfriend, throws her out of his apartment, and with no other choices, Gloria moves upstate New York into her parents' home, Soon she reacquaints with former grade school friend Oscar. Meanwhile, a giant monster once again terrorizes Seoul. It isn't long before we realize there is a connection between Gloria and the monster... but how? At this point we are 15 min, into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from up-and-coming Spanish writer-director Nacho Vigalondo. Here he brings a lighthearted science fiction tale about an improbable connection between a woman and a giant monster halfway around the world. If you have seen the movie's trailer, you know exactly what to expect in the first 30 minutes, and the movie plays that out faithfully. The question is what comes after, and I have to see I was quite taken by surprise--in the best possible way (I'm biting my lips here--mustn't reveal more!). In the current age of movie franchises, sequels, prequels and whatever else, it is so rare to see something that is truly different and original, and ""Colossal"" surely delivers on that. Anne Hathaway gives an outstanding performance as Gloria (she also exec-produced), with great support from Jason Sudeikis as Oscar. As you are watching the movie, this feels like a ""big"" production, and for European norms it certainly is, but the reported $15 mill. production budget is of course just peanuts in Hollywood terms. It shows once again that you don't need $100 mill. to make an entertaining and original sci-fi movie.""Colossal"" premiered to immediate critical acclaim last Fall at the Toronto International Film Festival. The movie opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but TWO screens, a rarity. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (3 people, including myself), much to my surprise. Regardless, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish, and applaud its originality and wit. If you are in the mood for a sci-fi that is miles away from the umpteenth rehash of what you've seen before, by all means please check out ""Colossal"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

32,subxerogravity,Man! That was strange.,7,18 April 2017,"So strange it's hard to say weather it's good or bad, it's just weird.  Then again, it's a really good weird because you know, Giant monsters  are in it. You can never go wrong with the Kaiju as they are known in  Japan and not Korea where the Giant monsters end up in Colossal.  Anne Hathaway plays a woman who comes back home after being kicked in  the face not wrongly by life and reconnects with her old friend, played  by Jason Sudeikis, and while home she discovers the oddest thing. At  8:05am every day if she's standing in the park next to her old  elementary school a Giant monster will appear in Seoul Korea that she  is somehow linked to.  It's like being John Malkovich meets Godzilla or something.  Once again Jason Sudeikis is the money maker for me, proving that he's  got some real star power. It was a brilliant turn as a man whose life  got stuck and watching someone else like Anne Hathaway's character live  her's despite failing badly at it, leaves him with a bitterness that he  cannot hide for long. As Oscar, Sudeikis was just a very unique  character to watch on the screen.  Despite the plot about Giant Monsters hitting the far East, which  really put this movie out there, Colossal has going for it a very  grounded story about being away for something for so long that you  forgotten why you tried so hard to avoid it, then realizing exactly why  you did. It's a lesson on getting over the things that cause self abuse  and hold you down. A very loud and clear lesson done in the strangest  way possible.",Colossal

Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is an alcoholic, self-destructive writer who ends up returning to her small town home, where she starts hanging out with child-hood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). Soon after, a giant monster appears in Seoul that seems to mirror her behaviour when she is a specific point in a playground. She is initially amused, but when her drunken cavorting results in multiple deaths, realizes that there can be disastrous consequences to thoughtless behaviour. Unfortunately, Oscar also discovers that he too can generate a giant avatar, which he uses as leverage in his increasingly abusive relationship with Gloria. The film is an enjoyable, well-acted parable despite a number of plot holes, lapses in logic, and a cast of not particularly likable characters. Don't hold your breath for an explanation, none is offered beyond a cryptic flashback sequence that connects Oscar and Gloria with the time and place of the monster manifestations. Note: Toho threatened to sue based on early descriptions of the project that implied that Gloria's kaiju would be similar to Godzilla, however, there is little resemblance other than both creatures occasionally break into dance (see 1965's ""Invasion of The Astro Monster"" for an example of Godzilla's moves).",Colossal

He finally reaches his limit and tells her to get out-he needs a break. Anne goes back to her hometown and moves into her parents house-they are out of town for a while so she has the whole place to herself. That is when she runs into Jason, an old childhood friend, that offers her a job in his bar. Tim plays a local bar fly that is always hanging around the bar and giving advice. About this time is when Anne makes a connection with something she does-walks through a children's playground-and something happening clear across the world in Seoul, South Korea-a Godzilla-type monster terrorizes their city. The creature mimics her every move, as long as she is in the playground. When she steps out of the playground, the monster disappears. The only thing that could make it better would be if a giant robot would show up to fight the creature and.....Guess what? It does! It too is being controlled by a person-but not Anne. It is an interesting movie but I wish they would have explained a few things a little better. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

36,myriamlenys,original and daring,7,9 November 2019,"""Colossal"" is quite an original movie, straddling and subverting genres such as fantasy/science fiction, horror and psychological drama.It expertly mixes the sour, the sweet, the bitter and the spicy. While doing so, it tells a parable about one of the side-effects of addiction, to wit the danger that the addict might turn into a domestic abuser, become a magnet for domestic abusers, or both. The effects of all this destruction and/or self-destruction then feed and legitimize the addiction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle.Or perhaps ""Colossal"" tells a parable about a second subject too, to wit the inability (shown by many) to recognize the other as fully human, especially when that other speaks a different language and lives a few continents away. In the movie, the city of Seoul gets attacked by two giant intruders - I'm trying to avoid spoilers here - who destroy whole blocks. All over the world, bemused viewers react to the events. But not everybody reacts in the same way. Some people try to help, for instance by sending money ; others look upon the horror as some kind of computer game. Memes are created, drinking games are organized, fan clubs are formed, theories are swapped - and meanwhile the poor inhabitants fleeing in terror become but tiny dots on a television or computer screen. Because, you know, they're foreigners, they're not-us.This kind of attitude is as old as Babylon, but the rise of modern social and news media has only worsened the problem, by blurring the boundaries between fact and entertainment, catastrophe and spectacle.I found it an interesting movie, especially where it detailed some of the mechanisms involved in domestic abuse. (""I gave you a lot of stuff you didn't particularly need or want. And now you want to leave me ? You ungrateful vixen ! How can you break my heart after I furnished your house with second-hand stuff I inherited from an uncle I barely knew ?! You're spitting on Uncle Jack's grave !"") However, the movie also had its weaknesses. There were three or four minor characters who didn't bring much to the table, in terms of use, purpose or personality. Possibly these were meant as some kind of Greek chorus, but still, this annoyed me. And in my opinion the movie could easily have lost a quarter of an hour...",Colossal
37,TheOneThatYouWanted,Okayish. Turns into a different movie without notice.,7,29 April 2017,"Today we will be reviewing colossal. Which is sort of a giant monster film, it certainly has been marketed as one. You may remember this film from the drama that happened with it a few years back. When the director used images of Godzilla from Godzilla 2014, and used Godzilla's name multiple times in the synopsis of the film back when he was trying to sell it to studios. This is a hard film to review because it becomes a totally different movie about half way through. And the change in tone and mood is so sudden, that it totally throws you for a loop. Basically, the film is about a lady who moves back to her hometown after her alcoholism ruined her relationship. And soon after a giant monster appears in Korea and the lady comes to learn that she controls the monsters actions. And the film is more or less a lite hearted comedy with a little bit of drama. But right around the halfway mark it turns into a very serious drama with dark undertones, such as emotional and physical abuse. I'm not going to lie to you, I was put off by seeing a guy punch and hit a lady, especially after the movie is marketed as a comedy and starts out as such. The sudden turn to dark drama doesn't feel right because it seamlessly comes out of nowhere. But luckily the end of the film is actually pretty good. So yeah, the film isn't great but not bad. It isn't the kind of movie you have to see in theaters. The giant monster action is good but not a big part of the film. The monster is on screen for less than 5 minutes. There is also a giant robot, but it fights with the monster for less than 30 seconds in total. The idea behind the movie is a good one, but the overall execution does take a hit because of the unwarranted shift in theme and tone. Anyway, my final score for the film is a seven out of ten. The ending ultimately saves the film.",Colossal
38,justin-fencsak,Good but confusing,6,16 August 2017,"This independent monster movie is worth a rental and not a buy. This is because despite excellent casting by Anne Hathaway (who also executive produced this) and Jason Sudekis, and some cool CGI monster effects, the pacing of the movie is a bit slow and some people might have a hard time following the characters.

To say more about Colossal; to go over the themes and characterizations in earnest - heck, even to give you a synopsis would give you too much info. Just stop what you're doing, prime yourself for the uniquely absurd and enjoy the show.Okay fine, for the sake of cogency (and to fill up the margins) I will give you a little more. Colossal, spiritually is Kaiju movie a la Godzilla (1954) and King Kong (1933). Which is to say through much of the movie, there is a gigantic monster destroying Seoul, South Korea. Yet instead of focusing on the destruction and mayhem, the film concerns itself with two lonely alcoholics halfway across the globe, who are more connected to monster's sudden appearance than they both realize.Our primary protagonist is New York party girl and out-of-work writer Gloria (Hathaway), who's alcohol dependency has left her destitute and traveling back to her hometown to lick her wounds. While there, she reacquaints with Oscar (Sudeikis) an amiable towny who inherited his small town bar from his family way back when. Both feel stuck, both feel trapped and both see the monster in Seoul as an expression of their inner demons and maybe even a release.Now will you watch it? Now will you see this awkward mix of fantastical lunacy and indie movie sensibilities? Now will you take a few hours out of your day to check out what might be the most unique movie of the year? No? Would it help if I told you Anne Hathaway is pitch perfect as a multifaceted and deeply flawed heroine? I for one was never aboard the Hathaway Express. Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but the movies and the characters she gravitated towards always felt more like a marketing decision than a genuine desire to spread her wings. Here however, Hathaway's rueful pity party is immediately beguiling. Not in a sad-funny, quirky, Lost in Translation (2003) kind of way. No this movie has a whole other kind of vibe. The kind of unique, wanton, weirdly satisfying vibe that can only be sustained by a dude named Nacho behind the camera.The direction here can best be described as fierce and picturesque. Director Nacho Vigalondo clearly has an appreciation for a bright-light and boozy version of Midwest Americana. He has such a command of the look and feel in-fact, that when he knowingly breaks cinematic rules to further the story, every big reveal packs that much more of an emotional wallop. What we then end up with is a delicate balance of off-putting tones and surprising payoffs. Played by any other movie, one scene would be raucously funny instead of a cold snap of horror. One scene would be played off as romantic instead of goofy. The setup says ""sad,"" but the payoff says we're in for big laughs...and on, and on.Thus I leave you with that: a mind primed for something unique and interesting that jolts you with surprise after surreal surprise.",Colossal

Unusual roles for all the actors, performed well. Anne Hathaway held our attention.

42,pyrocitor,Nacho average monster movie (groan),10,19 May 2017,"Think of all the rules you normally assume about monster movies. Then get ready for Colossal to subvert, tweak, tease, and stomp all over them, in favour of something altogether unprecedented, as richly spun as it is utterly bonkers. One of the industry's few recent genuine surprises, Colossal lumbered in out of nowhere, its only publicity preamble being an (absurd) lawsuit from the producers of 2014's Godzilla over similarities (namely...both have giant monsters?). But there's nothing derivative about Nacho Vigalondo's viciously entertaining satire, which weaponizes kaiju tropes as trenchant, hilarious, and surprisingly dark social barbs, the end game being a rambunctiously fun yet grimly chilling commentary on the real monsters being - you guessed it - people.First off: there's an easy jab at Team Shyzilla in that, with roughly 10 minutes of monster mash, Colossal almost outperforms the budget-bloated mess that had the titular behemoth cameoing in his own movie. Still, Colossal is so much more than monster spectacle that, in sinking your teeth into its strange, idiosyncratic charms, you'll almost forget to get pumped for the Seoul-stomping mayhem. Vigalondo's subtly hilarious, razor-sharp script starts with a naturalistic, albeit familiar, portrait of a woman reeling from partying herself down to the cinders, with Hathaway capably riffing on her Rachel Getting Married burnout. But, just when it seems the stage is set for a schmaltzy indie rom-com about broken people healing (complete with genre darling Jason Sudekis on hand): in come news reports of a gigantic monster (which, during production, probably didn't intend to evoke Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy so strongly...thankfully Disney is no such lawsuit lemming), causing havoc rampaging through South Korea. And the rug is yanked, the whole game changed, and we're off on the most raucously oddball (anti)blockbuster of the year, complete with CGI that valiantly outshines its modest budget, and a playfully ominous score by superb 10 Cloverfield Lane composer Bear McCreary that perfectly sets the lurching monster vibe.But, one twist is not enough for Vigalondo. And just when we start to acclimatize to Colossal's wonderfully weird, cheerfully nonsense butterfly effect internal grammar, somehow finding a cohesive midpoint between goofiness and tragedy while leaving room for a few indelible monster movie images (apologetic Korean calligraphy, for one), Vigalondo yanks the rug out from us...again. Welcome to a third act tonal switch so unexpectedly distressing you unconsciously creep to the edge of your seat more from chills than thrills. It's here that Colossal shows its dwarfing, scaly hand: it's a film all about control - having it, losing it, and the abhorrent depths humans stoop to to reclaim it, at all costs. Suddenly, a film about gigantic Michael Bay-FX escapees transmogrifies into one of the most shamefully realistic, painfully tense human stories of the past several years, while sprinkling in micro-commentaries on consent, addiction, gender dissonance, overseas media violence and spectatorship, and self-esteem for good measure. If there a momentary wobble, it's Vigalondo's reliance on fairy-light flashbacks to frame character revelations, which flirts with daft cliché...until, naturally, their seeming sappiness is revealed to be all part of the plan, and key to a final big reveal as f*cked up as it is clever. And then, before you know it, we rumble into a climax more emotionally laden and bombastically, cathartically thrilling than most Hollywood fare boasting 10 times the budget can muster. If nothing else, you'll never look at a sandbox the same way again.If there's ever been an actor perfectly poised to navigate Colossal's bizarre blend of Hollywood and indie energies, it's Anne Hathaway. She anchors the film with a powerhouse performance, part acerbic silliness, part raw, dripping vulnerability, all grounded by a steadfast charisma too honest not to believe, in spite of the emotional and tonal roller coasters the film takes her on. Matching her, Jason Sudekis is a flooring revelation, proving himself to be a remarkable performer as capable of wells of immense, terrifying darkness as he is a quirky, affable, goofball, often within seconds of one another. Finally, Beauty and the Beast's Dan Stevens gives an impressively precise performance teetering the balance between charmingly sympathetic and didactic asshole, while veteran character actor Tim Blake Nelson is always readily on hand for a fiendishly funny non-sequitur, like Donny from The Big Lebowski, but with more encroaching puppy dog sadness.Somehow (somehow...!) so much more than the cataclysmically collision of its disparate parts, Colossal pairs the introspective whimsy of Gareth Edwards' Monsters with the stomping, metaphoric social drama of the original (read: good) Godzilla, spun through a cheeky p*ss-take of a cutesy indie movie, while still leaving more surprises - and not always pleasant ones - in store. It's a thoroughly unexpected genre-bending gem, as resonant as it is massively fun. And although its limited release and head scratching high concept will, sadly but inevitably, strip it of the widespread adulation it deserves, if you're wondering how Vigalondo's film will fare as a retroactive cult hit... well, let's just say you won't have to fish for an adjective for very long.-9.5/10",Colossal

So here is the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway ), some confused woman separating from his hubby ( or boy friend ?) and meets her old school days friend in his bar, where later she works as a waitress. Actually she and her friend both are monsters in somewhere ( in Seoul here) so they as act in their yard effects as get on in the Seoul too with same actions of monsters!. Like they step their foot in yard and monster step his foot in china. Wow! Seems a child story, mostly tell on sleeping time. And what is the end? See movie.
But presentation is very poor of such fantasy story. Gloria gets a room from his friend. Next scene she gets TV, in the next sofa and in another next all necessary equipments for home. Gifting items are going on such way. We are seeing these stupid things again and again. Story trails almost here and only taking charge at the climax.

While they seem somewhat civil with each other as Sudeikis helps Hathaway to start over again when her relationship breaks up, not everything is as it seems. Sudeikis's character harbors feelings of inadequacy and jealousy since they were children and eventually they manifest themselves through the creation of Godzilla- like monsters rampaging Seoul, Korea.

46,rockman182,Colossal (2017),6,26 May 2017,"If you haven't seen the trailer for this film and you go in blind, you'll be pretty shocked with what you see. The film is without a doubt pretty original and unique in its composition and its ability to mix genres and try to use its creativity to tell a story. While this works or not is a different story but I admire any type of creativity and risks in storytelling. Overall, I don't think the delivery of this film did what was needed for its intent and its shifting moods in comedy and darkness leaves the film feeling imbalanced.The film is about a recovering alcoholic, named Gloria (played by Anne Hathaway), who has a breakup and revisits her hometown. There she meets her old friend (played by Jason Sudeikis). Gloria starts realizing some weird occurrences in Seoul, South Korea. A giant Kaiju appears in Seoul and she soon realizes that that Kaiju is her. Whenever she steps into a playground her body and actions are enacted by a giant monster at the same time in Seoul. Oscar (Sudeikis) is a giant robot in Seoul whenever he steps into the playground and tries to cause destruction (not only in Korea but also in Gloria's life).Its hard to really explain what goes on in the film but its simply understood if you watch the film. As I mentioned earlier I liked how creative the film was although I think the trailer seemed to represent a much more comedic take while this film is quite dark and dramatic in its delivery. Its hard to really get into the fun of the idea because of the themes of manipulation and mental and physical abuse. The monster and robot in the film looked pretty cool though and I had a flashback of Pacific Rim while watching. Vigalondo definitely knew what he was going for but I'm not sure if it always works.Anne Hathaway or Sudeikis don't really have to put in a lot of effort for their performances but its still great stuff all around. I did like the explanation of why the monsters appear. i mean its still fantastical but at least it attempts to make some sense of an inexplicable occurrence. In the same way the ending also is a great way of dealing with the major conflict of the film. Overall, in rating I'll be generous to the film for its creativeness and explanation of origins of the monsters, however the film isn't always a blast and cannot always avoid feeling dreary.6.5/10",Colossal

The film is made on a small scale budget in relation to modern monster movies such as this Spring's new King Kong film, or even the reboot of the Godzilla franchise that came out a couple of years ago. Hollywood definitely does not generally know how to make these type of films anymore. I remember in my teens, staying up late on a Friday, or Saturday night and watching these schlock B movies that would be shown on television after most sane people would have gone to bed. You are probably aware of the kind. The ones with the monsters that look like giant plastic action figures that you would find in a ten year old boy's toy collection, or backdrops and buildings meant to resemble large cities such as Tokyo, or various other places which were destroyed by the monsters on question, and these were just cheap cardboard cutouts that were easily crushed and destroyed by these monsters and then probably taken out back into a giant recycling bin to do your part for the environment. These films were probably never intended to be great films, but in a way they were a fun part of my years growing up and I think to many others as well, especially if you lived in the 50's, or 60's and got to see these movies at the drive in, or even on late night television hosted by Vampira, or a variety of late night hosts. Colossal, is in a certain regard a monster film, but I am also happy to report that it is also so much more than that. The film's trailer unfortunately gives away too many of the key plot points, so I will avoid by divulging them any further. However, I will say that this is a film that many will look at and think that the filmmaker is either a genius, or out of his mind and I think a lot of people that walk out of the movie will not be quite sure what they have just witnessed, but trust me, this is all a very good thing. This is a film that uses the backdrop of giant monsters to tell a much more deep story involving such real issues including alcoholism, bullying and dealing with the different targets and stresses that set us off in life and how we are not always in command of our behaviour, or actions, even though we really should be and if not this could lead to major consequences not only for ourselves, but others also. The film took me a little while to get used to it's off the wall humour and collection of characters, but once I got in the right mindset, I was enjoying this film thoroughly and not only was I entertained by what I was watching, but it also made me think and gives one plenty of things to reflect upon after the film is over, which I don't think you would be able to say for your average Hollywood monster movie. This is a film which may seem silly, or like a bad rejected Hollywood script to some, but instead we have a great piece of entertainment here that also touches upon some very real and very human emotions and issues that I am so glad they brought up and incorporated into the script. I haven't seen her performance in Rachel Getting Married, but of the films I have seen with Anne Hathaway, I can safely say that this is my favourite and probably her best performance that I have seen thus far. A humorous performance at times certainly, but also a great portrait of someone who clearly has gone off the deep end and needs a major wake up call. I am happy to report that the small theatre in which I saw Colossal was packed and this is just further proof that if major theatre chains gave these films a chance they would certainly do well because there definitely is an audience for it. As it stands this is the first great film I have seen of 2017 and one of the most original in awhile which is a feat all by itself. Excellent job.",Colossal

51,dave-mcclain,"""Colossal"" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie.",6,23 April 2017,"Anne Hathaway has had a big career, with major moments and some huge film successes, but nothing in her career could rightly be called colossal. That is, until 2017. The sci-fi/fantasy action comedy ""Colossal"" (R, 1:50) qualifies in name, if not in reality. Hathaway's first feature film was the 2001 Disney hit ""The Princess Diaries"", which led to a couple more princess movies (""The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement"" and ""Ella Enchanted""). Hathaway soon transitioned to adult roles in movies like ""Havoc"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Love & Other Drugs"". Her talent made her an Academy darling, as she was nominated for an Oscar for 2008's ""Rachel Getting Married"", she co-hosted the 2011 Academy Awards (with James Franco) and then she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her acting and singing in 2012's ""Les Misérables"". Since then, she reprised her role as the voice of Jewel in ""Rio 2"", again played The White Queen in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" and starred in ""Interstellar"", ""The Intern"" and ""Colossal"".Hathaway plays Gloria, a confirmed party girl who can't hold a job and shows all the signs of being an alcoholic. She lives with her boyfriend, Tim (Dan Stevens, in one of his half-dozen or so 2017 films), who tires of her irresponsible ways and kicks her out. She has no choice but to move back to her small (unspecified) hometown and start living in her childhood home which is (for unspecified reasons) unfurnished and vacant. While hauling a newly purchased air mattress back to her parents' house, she runs into Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), a childhood friend who now runs his late father's minimally successful bar. Gloria starts hanging out with Oscar and his after-hours drinking buddies, Garth (Tim Blake Nelson) and Joel (Austin Stowell). Oscar soon offers Gloria a job as a waitress and starts bringing her some major creature comforts (furniture, a big-screen TV, etc.), obviously trying to get her interested in him romantically, even though she's still in contact with Tim and seems to have eyes for the handsome Joel.But it's only when a colossal, vaguely human-looking monster suddenly appears and wreaks Godzilla-style havoc on Seoul, South Korea that Gloria's life REALLY gets complicated. Watching news footage, she sees that this monster seems to have her scalp-scratching nervous tic. Then, she notices that this creature half-way around the world, makes the same gestures and movements that she makes when she happens to be in the playground area of a local park – and at exactly 8:05 a.m. local time (a time and place with which she only has a tenuous connection with roots in her childhood). After another all-night drinking session, Gloria brings Oscar, Joel and Garth to the playground, asks them to stream live news from Seoul and demonstrates her connection to the monster. Then, as she and her friends try to figure out what's really going on and what it means (and as she's racked with guilt over the destruction and loss of life in Seoul) another creature appears, one that seems to have issues with Gloria's monster.""Colossal"" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie. The premise that Spanish writer-director (and past Oscar nominee) Nacho Vigalondo gives us is gleefully fresh and loaded with potential. It even features subtle messages about addiction and toxic relationships. The problem is the details. Too much goes unexplained – and the reasons that are given for the story's strange and remarkable occurrences are thinly and illogically developed. It's enough to drive a reflective Movie Fan to distraction. And that's before we even discuss the unnecessarily off-putting developments regarding some of the characters. It's as if Vigalondo has set a fantastic table and then tried to do that trick of yanking the tablecloth out from under the dishes, only to break most of them. In other words, I loved the first half of this movie, hated much of the second half and only kind of liked the ending.For me, all that adds up to a mild recommendation, based on the movie's creative premise, Hathaway's typically excellent work and the entertainment value of about half of the film. (Sudeikis' superficial performance in what is admittedly a tough role to play doesn't do Vigalondo any favors.) I can't even evaluate the movie with a bad pun based on its title, because it's neither a colossal success nor a colossal failure. There's a great movie somewhere in there trying to break out, but it's held back by its own unfortunate and avoidable shortcomings. My advice? Watch up to the point that Gloria motions for Oscar to leave the playground. Then stop. That moment feels like an ending (to an enjoyable movie). But considering everything between the opening credits and the closing credits, the most that I can give this underachiever is a ""B"".",Colossal

53,bob-the-movie-man,A Marvel-ous Indie Movie,8,25 May 2017,"Well!! I've been really surprised (in a good way) by two films this year, and both have involved monsters (the first being ""A Monster Calls"" back in January).It's really difficult to categorise ""Colossal"" – IMDb classes it as a ""Comedy, Action, Drama"". Comedy? Yes, but it's a very dark comedy indeed. Action? Hmm, not really if you go to this expecting 'Godzilla 2' or some polished Marvel-style film (not that I was!) you will be sorely disappointed. Drama? This is probably the nearest match, since at its heart this is a clever study on the people and relationships at the heart of a bizarre Sci-Fi event.Anne Hathaway (""Les Miserables"") stars as Gloria, a borderline alcoholic-waster sponging off the good-natured but controlling Tim (Dan Stevens, ""Beauty and the Beast"") in his New York apartment. When Tim's patience finally runs out, Gloria returns to her hometown to an empty house and the attentions of a former school friend, bar owner Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), who clearly holds an unhealthy fascination with her. Borrowing an idea from ""A Monster Calls"", at a specific time in the US morning a huge monster appears from thin air in Seoul, South Korea, killing people and smashing buildings in a seemingly uncoordinated and random way. Bizarrely, this only happens when Gloria is standing at a particular spot in a particular kid's playground. Could the two events possibly be related?I always like to categorize films in my head as being ""like"" others, but this one's really difficult to pin down. It borrows its main premise from a famous scene in ""E.T."" (indeed one also involving alcohol) but the film's fantasy elements and dark undertones have more similarities in style to ""Jumanji"". Then again, there are elements of the Kaufman about it in that it is as weird in some places as ""Being John Malkovich"".The film stays on 'Whimsical Street' for the first half of the film, but then takes a sharp left turn into 'Dark Avenue' (and for ""dark"" read ""extremely black and sinister""). It then becomes a far more uncomfortable watch for the viewer. The metaphor of the monster for Gloria's growing addiction is clear, but emerging themes of control, jealousy, violent bullying and small-town social entrapment also emerge.Here the acting talents of Hathaway and Sudeikis really come to the fore: heavyweight Hollywood talent adding some significant 'oomph' to what is a fairly modest indie project. Hathaway is in kooky mode here, gurning to great comic effect, and this adds warmth to a not particularly likable character. And Sudeikis (more commonly seen in lighter and frothier comedies like ""We're the Millers"" and ""Horrible Bosses"") is a surprise in the role delivering some real acting grit.The writer and director is Spaniard Nacho Vigalondo. No, me neither. But he seems to have come from nowhere to deliver this high profile cinema release, and it would not be a surprise for me to see this nominated as an original screenplay come the awards season. His quirky style is refreshing. (Hell, delivering ANY novel new summer movie that is not part of a franchise or TV re-boot is refreshing!) The film's not perfect, and its disjointed style can be unsettling. While the lead characters are quite well defined, others are less so. Joel in particular, played by Austin Stowell (""Whiplash"", ""Bridge of Spies""), is such an irritating doormat of a character that you just want to thump him yelling ""Do Something you wimp"" to his face!I am normally the first to pick scientific holes in a story, but here the story is so ""out there"" that the details become irrelevant, and – like ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2"" – the film revels in its absurdity. (There is however a jumbo jet sized hole in the plot if you think about it!) But some of the moments of revelation (particularly one set in a wood) are brilliantly done and you are never quite sure where the film is going to go next. I was concerned that the ending would not live up to the promise of the film, but I was not disappointed. Like ""A Monster Calls"" the film will probably suffer at the box office by its marketing confusing the audience. People will assume it's possibly a ""monster movie"" or maybe a piece of comedy fluff (particularly with Sudeikis in the cast), but in reality it's neither of these. It won't be to everyone's tastes for sure, but in the bland desert of most movie releases, here is something interesting and novel and in my book definitely worthy of your movie dollar.

Yet the storyline is disjointed and lacks effective transitions. Gaps need to be filled in the writing/directing. Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis and Tim Blake Nelson are fun to watch, yet Nelson seems somewhat restrained. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",Colossal

56,Alexander_Blanchett,A new genre: Fantasy character drama,8,3 February 2018,"A very good and original film. It works on two levels. First it is a fantasy film but it is also a strong film about finding yourself and, finding your place in this world and facing your own past. The screenplay was excellent and one of the most inspired and original screenplays in a long time. I am surprised it did not get more attention. Its radical, its funny, its sad and full of little twists and excellent character development.
Anne Hathaway is giving a great lead performance. She nicely acts against her own image and gives her role Gloria a lot of life and plays her extemeley natural. Jason Sudekis was also good in a rare serious role. I loved how they went with his character and how it transformed throughout the whole film. 
The effects were excellent considering the low budget of the film. The soundtrack was good, the cinematography and editing worked very well and created an excellent atmosphere. I liked that it really took time to introduce and manage its characters. Good film, very underrated.",Colossal
57,apryla-58795,So THIS is the reason Jason Sudeikis's career ended,3,1 December 2019,"A Godzilla like monster shows up in Seoul Korea every morning at 8:05 am and causes death & destruction to the city and no one knows why.Meanwhile in NY City Gloria (Anne Hathaway) lives with Tim (Dan Stevens) and has lost her job. She stays at home sleeping during the day and then goes out drinking and partying all night. Tim is fed up with it and kicks her out. She goes back to her hometown to her parent's house which is deserted but the electricity still works. Didn't figure out where the parents are or why she never tried to get in contact with them.One day on her way back walking home from purchasing a blowup air mattress Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) drives past her in his truck. They both stop when it dawns on them that they know each other. They went to school together and when she grew up she left for NYC. He asks if he can give her a ride and she gets in the truck and he takes her to the bar that he's inherited from his dad. He's fixed it up and it looks really nice. They start talking and reminiscing. Oscar introduces her to two of his friends played by Austin Stowell and Tim Blake Nelson (who added zero to this film). Tim offers Gloria a job because he realizes she's down on her luck and could use the money. She starts ""working"" there (and by working I mean it basically involves all of them sitting around drinking during working hours and not doing much work) and Oscar starts bringing her stuff from his Uncle's house that the Uncle doesn't need anymore.One day Gloria's sister calls her and alerts her to this monster that has shown up in Seoul. Gloria goes online and can't believe what she's seeing. Soon she and the entire world are glued to their TV's and social media trying to figure out what is going on with this phenomenon.Gloria watches the latest video from Seoul one day and it hits her that the monster is making the same motions she is. She starts doing research and then conducts a test where she goes to a local playground and starts making motions with her arms. She then goes back and watches the video and verifies her observation that the monster is indeed making exactly the same motions as she. Gloria tells Oscar and his two friends and pretty soon they're caught up in it as well.Things seem to be going along ok with Gloria getting into a groove of working. Oscar attempts to get closer to her.One day Tim decides to come into town unexpectedly to get Gloria back and when Oscar finds out about this he lets off fireworks inside his bar essentially destroying a lot of it and causing a lot of damage. He then proceeds to show up at Gloria's house to make sure that she doesn't contact Tim and try to go back to New York. Gloria realizes that Oscar is just miserable with himself. She keeps seeing this recurring scene in her head of herself as a little girl. One day on her way walking to school with Oscar a strong gust of wind carries off her school project. Oscar quickly runs off to try to retrieve it but when he gets a hold of it he doesn't save it-instead he stomps on it destroying it. So he was never trying to be helpful as we are led to believe the whole time-he was mean as a kid and now as an adult he's got addictions and problems of his own.Gloria and Oscar get into a fight after she tells him that he is basically just angry that his life is going nowhere and eventually they end up at the playground. Oscar tells Gloria that if she doesn't stay in town he's going to come to the playground every morning and tear it up which will cause a bunch of destruction in Seoul. He beats her up and leaves her on the ground.Next she's on a plane to Seoul and she faces down the monster and throws him far away from Seoul. The monster was actually Oscar.At the very end Gloria walks into a bar and the bartender asks her if she has seen what's been going on and Gloria says yes and then she asks ""Do you want to hear a crazy story?"" The bartender says ""Yes. Do you want something to drink?"" Gloria rolls her eyes and huffs and then the screen cuts to black.The problem I had with this film is that all the advertisements made it out to be a comedy but this turned out to be anything but. It was a story about addiction and these monsters were just representative of Gloria and Tim and their inner demons. It became very dark and heavy towards the end and the acting wasn't that great. So many of the characters were completely unnecessary. I don't know what the filmmaker's goal was in mind when they made this but they went about it completely wrong and it just bombed.I had this in my queue for the longest time and now I know why I never clicked on it before today. I would not watch this as it's not funny-it's actually confusing and depressing. Avoid!",Colossal

59,SquigglyCrunch,An Engaging Character Study Advertised as a Dumb Comedy,8,25 August 2017,"Colossal follows a woman who discovers that she controls a giant monster attacking Seoul with her movements, and how she tries to learn to manage that responsibility.Upon seeing the trailers I dismissed this as a garbage comedy with a dumb concept, but upon seeing the movie it's something much more. For starters, the concept is handled in a way that I didn't at all expect. It handles it with a lot of seriousness. It takes a concept that could make for a mildly entertaining children's movie, and shows it how it would really play out. The characters who get involved are real people and when the monster comes into play there are real consequences. When it comes down to it, this is a movie about supernatural circumstances and how people would respond to those circumstances if they became reality. And as a result, the movie is very unique. It's a one-of-a-kind movie.Some of this uniqueness does come through as self-aware, out there comedy. Most of it works, but it's very unusual. Still, with a concept like this one, they don't really feel out of place. Looking back at those scenes they were really weird, but still fun. Most of it isn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it's good.As much as I did love this movie, there is a point towards the last act where one character has a fairly sudden mental switch and while it doesn't really distract from the flow of the film, it's hard to ignore it.Overall I loved Colossal. As a comedy it isn't that good, but as a movie it's great. I loved the direction the movie took, and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend watching it.",Colossal

63,coreyjdenford,Colossally funny,8,19 May 2017,"This review of Colossal is spoiler free**** (4/5)NATURALLY WHEN A distributor spawns a new monster, immediately the film will be filled with destruction, chaos - sirens blaring and people dying. It's rare that the monster is used for good deeds. Colossal comes as a novelty, its budget is rather small ($5 million), it's a comedy. Enter Spanish maverick Nacho Vigalondo, the 40-year-old writer-director who since his 2007 debut Timecrimes has come up in the world of film. This is more bizarre than his debut, yet at the same it's oddly heroic. Anne Hathaway's Gloria is the film's heroine, in a role that's closest to Rachel Getting Married she plays as a high-functioning alcoholic - party girl enjoying life in New York until she is kicked out by her ex-boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens in a slightly wasted role). She is forced to move to her home town, there she meets with her old friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) - they talk about old times. From there it gets weird, as in a giant monster mimicking the movements of human being weird. We've had mimicking robots in Real Steel, and we've had giant robots controlled by humans in Pacific Rim, but we've never had a monster controlled by a human. Here the monster, that looks like it came out of Pan's Labyrinth copies movements from Gloria, it's also here when it hits the funny bone with wicked speed - more notably when the monster is hit in the head or dancing maniacally. Enough of the detail - its best that this is shown with you knowing the less about it, because the less you know - the better it is. It's not a flood of laughs from the get-go it's progressive, but when a joke hits you it's blissfully relentless - it comes like a ton of bricks. Vigalondo's direction along with his hilarious screenplay is exceptional proving he has real fire in his eye by not only defying movie monster logic but with the way he handles his characters he gives them heft; whether it's the way Gloria deals with her alcoholic state, through hilariously pulling punches and to her horrible childhood - which due to an outstanding flashback shows the routes of the monster. The performances pull punches too - the two leads Hathaway and Sudeikis are magnetic together, working together to get to the routes of this monster. Seemingly, he's a nice guy at one point he helps get her back on track, then the next he's completely against her. Colossal isn't perfect there's a flaw - a moment when Tim is trying to reconnect with her that sadly over-stays its welcome. With a budget that'll make Kong's left bicep - this is cool, smart filmmaking with a plot that'll be talked about in times to come.VERDICT: Hathaway and Sudeikis are magnetic in a tonally bizarre yet, pleasingly funny, outrageously weird, utterly compelling and oddly heroic comedy which hits the right notes.",Colossal
64,jamiedarlow-37510,Love or hate film. And I really didn't like it,3,28 April 2020,"Gloria (Anne Hathaway) loves a party but over the years has become more and more dependant on alcohol to have a good time. After being kicked out by her boyfriend, she moves back to her hometown to try and settle down into a healthier lifestyle. After reuniting with an old school friend (Jason Sudeikis) and having a few more nights out, she discovers a connection between her and a massive Kaiju-esque monster that is running amok in Souel on the news! The premise is pretty wild and the trailers make it to be much funnier and quirkier than it actually is. In all fairness, part of its problem is that it is marketed as a sci-fi comedy and it doesn't really satisfy on either level. It's much more intense and uncomfortable than I was expecting and at times it feels like it's going to get interesting while it toys with metaphorical statements on the destructive nature of alcoholism and jealousy. Unfortunately those moments are short lived and the narrative is surprisingly boring by making hardly any sense at all and the character development is shocking. In particular, the villains incentive for being such a dick was never made clear and was just an infuriating side note on an already messy plot. On the plus side, the performances are great; Hathaway is fantastic as always and Sudeikis is really good with moments of being intensely scary. Sadly they don't have the story or script to back them up",Colossal
65,jwscott-home,Clearly most people reviewing have no idea what it's really about,8,27 June 2021,"It's about Alcoholism and every character played a role in in what is a typical alcoholic relationship, from the alcoholic to the friends who don't know what to do or how to help, to the ones who unwittingly help the alcoholic continue his drinking, to the family, to the destruction both physically and emotionally and of course the monster is who the alcoholic becomes. And they showed just how normal a practicing alcoholic could flip from Mr nice guy to seemingly a monster and back again during bouts of drinking. It's a perfect symbolism for all the dynamics that are a part of alcoholism. It even went deeper to show how you can't run away from it, there's always another group of likeminded alcoholics or users wherever they go and it's not going to change until you face your demon (killing the robot). All kinds of smaller symbolisms that are part of the disease. If you've ever been a part of an alcoholics life or the alcoholic itself, you'd find the movie spot on. However if you haven't then this movie probably won't make any sense to you.

She hears shocking news of giant creature threatening the capital of South Korea and comes to a realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon. Also starring: Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, Austin Stowell, Tim Blake Nelson. This is one of those few 'weird' cool movies that deserve to go big. Having premiered in Toronto film festival last September and ready to attack multiplexes now, Colossal"" offers fresh approach to monster and superhero movies, or maybe we should call it pastiche or something. It's a surehanded work by a guy who clearly knows and loves those genres, and feels confident about adding some stuff of his own. Solely written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, the Spanish filmmaker perhaps best known for time-travelling mindbender Los cronocrímenes"" (2007), it's an experience so unexpected that I am not even sure how much if liked it. Sure, I liked most of it while watching, and liked some of it even more after going over everything intellectually later. But sitting in cinema, I felt unsatisfied at times without being able to clearly say why. Perhaps I just don't buy how the story reaches its turning point and transforms one major character – although it makes much more sense in the end. Perhaps Colossal"" offers too many genres for its own good (monster movie, horror, drama, comedy, thriller, revenge, romance) and the potential impact of the whole result is weakened by this. Or perhaps it was just all too original for me and I would learn to appreciate it much more on the second go? But there's one thing that I am sure of: Colossal"" is bigger than sum of its parts and feels fresh even if it reminds bunch of other movies. Most of all, Shyamalan came to mind although Vigalondo is a better writer with a better sense fo making story compact and still giving the events and characters enough room to develop and breathe. If you only watch one 'weird' cool mainstream-friendly movie this year, you should still pick Get Out"", but Colossal"" is noteworthy too. It can thrill and surprise you, and the acting's pretty good also. Hathaway as the leading lady actually seems a bit hammy at times, which is probably expected of her character. The showstealer here is, surprisingly, Jason Sudeikis who feels like a supporting player for big part of the movie and then turns into something of a revelation. I have never been ready to appreciate Sudeikis as a worthwhile addition to all the mainstream movie actors today. He is known for a bunch of forgettable comedies such as Horrible Bosses"". At the same time, he has always felt strong enough performer and comedian in technical sense, good with lines, timing, and teamplay. Colossal"" gives him an unexpected chance to shine, and he doesn't waste a single second of spotlight. I can't speak much about why he's so great here without giving spoilers about the story. But this kind of strong presence is surely surprising and has instantly made Sudeikis hundred times more interesting as an actor than ever before. Here's hoping that Vigalondo has Tarantino-like powers to make actors cool. Based on Colossal"", I'd like to see Sudeikis turn into a star.",Colossal

Sadly there was something lacking in the execution. It just didn't feel put together correctly, like there was something in the story telling that was missing that would have made it more compelling.Anne Hathaway was cast a bit too far out of character. She just wasn't quite believable as the wastrel party girl. She couldn't quite pull off acting drunk. Her character's story is a classic redemption tale, with the monster twist.Jason Sudeikis plays her foil in the story. His character arc is very poorly handled. There wasn't enough setup, almost like a few scenes in the middle were cut. That being said, he played it pretty well, except it was hard to tell when he was supposed to be drunk.As I've mentioned both main characters being drunk, there is a lot of drinking in this movie. The central movie set being the bar run by Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) where Gloria (Anne Hathaway) starts working. This is after returning to a home her parent's left vacant, and after being kicked out by her boyfriend for being a party girl who can't get her life together. This is where I would caution that this isn't really an appropriate movie for children, despite the silly almost cartoon premise.The bottom line of a movie review is the recommendation of whether or not to see it.

78,RhapsodyReviews,Brilliant Take on a Monster Movie.,10,20 September 2019,"Review:
'Colossal' is a Canadian-Spanish black-comedy film written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo. This is one of the most original movies to come out of the 2010's. I love the way it captures mental illness in a way that can also tell unique and entertaining story.
The film centers around Gloria, an unemployed young writer (Anne Hathaway) who is unwittingly causing a giant monster to wreak havoc halfway across the world.
I was loving everybody in this movie, they hit all the notes they needed too at the right moments. I was shocked by the performance of Jason Sudeikis. I really didn't think he would be able to pull this character off the way he did. At the beginning of the film, he is playing what I would say it a good role for him, by the time the movie changes tones, so does his character and he pulls it off. Job well-done sir.
It's such a shame that original movies like this don't get noticed at the Box-Office. This movie only made $4.5 million worldwide. The concept of this movie is hard to appreciate and not everybody is going to understand the underlying message, I didn't at first watch. I watched it again and it's incredible. This is a hard review to write because I don't want to give anything about it away.
Overall, watch the movie. Plane and simple. I think everybody should watch this movie, more than once if needed.

79,hoytyhoyty,"Ah, morons and their negative reviews. NOT a colossal waste of time, in fact quite the opposite.",8,22 July 2017,"I mean, being realistic, they can't help being stupid. They were born that way. It's when you read negative review after negative review for a film like this that you remember, painfully, that many people actively voted for Donald Trump and Tony Abbott.It's sad, but it's just an evolutionary fact. Lots of the populace are very, very stupid.For the lucky rest of us, with brains bigger than a gnat's, we get to enjoy movies like this. Clever little genre-bending, daydream, thought experiments.I DID enjoy 'Colossal', and in fact I can only really level one criticism at it: Just after the start, during the setup, it becomes a little slow and it did bore me for a few minutes.I decided to give it more of a chance (it really gets rolling after that point, oh boy does it), but I can see why morons would have turned off. Heck, I can see why INTELLIGENT people might have turned off, since we have been bombarded with slow pseudo-art garbage pretending to be clever.That could explain a little more of the negativity; those who couldn't face another ""Mr. Nobody"" or ""Melancholia"" or ""El Incidente"" just walked away, saying ""no more, no more..."" And I can understand, fully. (The problem being, it left the morons who will watch anything to watch it through, and only THEN realise they didn't understand it.) But Colossal isn't one of those self-indulgence fests.It's tight, it resolves it's arc, and it PULLS IT OFF! It DELIVERS.The ridiculous premise sets it up as a fantasy, or what is sometimes called 'Slipstream' these days (stuff that bends reality weirdly, regardless of the story basis). That's a given. Then it proceeds to tell a gripping, dark, tense little tale around it (with an astounding ending).Anne Hathaway's physical beauty is wonderfully under-stated in this piece. Her hair is a fantastic cascade of sheer, wavy messiness and her clothes are random. She gets across a ""good time girl surviving issues"". Similarly all her acting colleagues' characters are represented as real-world, believable types; with BAGGAGE. Then they are forced to interact, and there come the surprises.Dark, nasty surprises.These producers bothered to actually hire a writer, folks.COLOSSAL is well worth your time.- -- ---",Colossal
80,danielharden,A decent film with one Colossal problem...,6,16 June 2017,"Original films are hard to come by nowadays. Everything is either based off a comic, novel or true story. So when an original concept comes along I automatically have a level of respect for the filmmakers while simultaneously crossing my fingers, wanting it to be good. Colossal is a truly unique movie that tells the story of Gloria, an alcoholic f*ck up who moves back to her hometown to clear up her act... Oh and at the same time there is a giant monster tearing through Seoul, South Korea at exactly 8:05 am in the morning that Gloria is somehow connected to through a children's playground. As I said this is a truly unique film that I have a lot of respect for, but really misses the mark in regards to character.This film is nuts. The story is original and really quite weird which lends itself to sequences that are also originally weird. The nature of the films story opens up doors to the director to construct some really well shot and original sequences such as the slo-mo stomp circle around Gloria. Writer/Director Nacho Vigalondo opens up some really creative doors for himself and he finds his way through some of them, however the film could have made better use of these open doors. Yes, there are original sequences to be had, but the film focuses too much on the protagonists alcoholism and real life rivalries, that the monster aspect becomes more of a dialogue topic than an attempt at original film making. I do understand however, that visual effects cost a lot of money, and the films visual effects are really good, very reminiscent of the classic Godzilla (Gojira), and thus I understand that budgeting may have been an issue, but it still doesn't change the fact that this film could have been handled and done much better.The acting in Colossal was pretty good. Anne Hathaway is decent in this film. A believably unlikable at times alcoholic with intensity in her emotions, she does a good job as the films lead. However, I thought Jason Sudeikis had the harder task and was far better in this film, making the absolute best out of a poorly written character. Sudeikis plays Oscar, a local who Gloria used to go to school with and now owns a bar. Sudeikis both makes you love him and then absolutely despise him in this role, and frankly he surprised me at how well he could pull off a full on psychopathic character. Although his character becomes more of a caricature once he goes full psychopath, Sudeikis' performance makes the best of this and is really quite disturbing to watch, so a lot of credit to Jason Sudeikis for turning lemons into lemonade on this one.As previously stated, the character of Oscar is terribly written. The character starts off as extremely likable, but then Vigalondo does a complete 180 degree shift in his character, which is so sudden it completely detaches you from the film. Oscar goes from sweet and lovable to full blown psychopath in a matter of minutes and it's extremely jarring. His character isn't developed at all and the attempts made during the film are extremely brief to the point of being pathetic. We are given one look at his apartment and a photo with his mums face scratched out and that is meant to explain why this man suddenly turned into a clinically insane psychopath all of a sudden.... I don't think so, seriously talk about eggshell thinness. I cannot get my head round this sudden shift in direction except for the sake of having a villain, but it simply was not needed and almost completely ruins the dynamic of the film.So what have we learnt? Don't drink alcohol because if you do you will be a f*ck up or at worse become a psychopath... Yep that about does it. But in all seriousness, Colossal is almost a complete screw up if it wasn't for strong lead performances and an okay attempt at creating original film making. I congratulate and respect the intentions of this filmmakers, even if the film doesn't live up to its full potential at all, but sadly I simply cannot forgive the drastic shift in Jason Sudeikis' character, that is simply a Colossal screw up.",Colossal
81,mbs,"Solidly engaging film may leave you with a couple of questions after its over, but Hathaway and Sudekis do terrific work",7,29 March 2017,"Attended a preview screening of this courtesy of a friend the other night with zero idea of what the movie was about so imagine to my surprise that it was a wry take on a Godzilla movie but with a seriously intriguing and rather perplexing narrative hook. If you're reading this right now, you're either deciding whether to see this, or you've already seen this and are looking for opinions on what other people thought. Without spoiling anything I'll just say that i thought the director (who also wrote the script) does an impressive job of keeping you into the story being told, and just slightly off track as to what's around the bend story wise. There were a couple times watching this where I thought i knew where the story was going to go, but ended up being somewhat off the mark. As the movie kept going I also started to wonder how the heck the director was going to bring this thing to a satisfying ending, and the answer to that question was with a fantastic climactic sequence that i very much liked watching unfold but didn't quite hit the mark in terms of satisfying to me, but somehow still felt quite right in keeping in tone with what we had been watching the whole time. So basically i'm just saying--its worth checking out but with some slight reservations about the story as it unfolded. (I personally thought the big reveal about the origins of the monster's appearance was a little too symbolic and mystical and out of the blue, but other people might like how its explained)All that said, the main concept of the movie i thought was pretty superb, and I thought Anne Hathaway in a kind of role we rarely if ever see her play was excellent and does a tremendous job in a very difficult role. If you don't like her, you'll end up hating the movie because she is a very large component of the movie. I thought even tho her character is aimless, she did a terrific job of keeping her likable throughout, even when you're kind of cringing at some of the decisions she makes on screen. Similarly, i thought the performance of Jason Sudekis was also surprisingly good. He starts out the film the way you normally see him in films, as the seemingly good hart-ed, wry, slightly bumbling slob, but as the story unfolds and he gradually starts to change those very qualities ever so subtly, it may not be til very late in the film or possibly thinking about it on the way home that you realize how strong a job he did as well playing opposite Hathaway. (Dan Stevens for the record has a very smallish part so if you're going to see this specifically for him, you might be disappointed) In closing i'll just say that if you already know the premise to the film and are wondering whether or not its for you, I'll just say that if you like slightly out there premises, you should check this out because overall despite again some narrative choices I might not have been too crazy about, i thought it was a very solidly engaging movie, and for what its worth, I didn't think it was too strange to appeal to people who think that this may be too far out there for their comfort zones/slightly more mainstream tastes.",Colossal
82,barbagvido,Why the hate? At least it's original!,8,1 October 2017,"Colossal is a movie starring Anne Hathaway as an alcoholic woman who is dumped by her boyfriend played by Dan Stevens and so she returns to her hometown intending to pull herself together and meets again with her childhood friend played by Jason Sudeikis who offers her a job at his bar. At the same time, the strange monster shows up and disappears every day in Seoul causing havoc.I was surprised by seeing all the negative reviews on this site because this is one unique movie. It's not perfect, but it's interesting, fun, well-acted and even kinda uplifting. The flaw is that some character motivations aren't very well explained and some things they do just feel kinda out of the blue and unearned, so they just come across as weird characters. And not much more than that. Aside from the lead, no one is really well-developed.But the movie is kinda charming. It has an original idea, I will not tell you how it goes together because I didn't know anything going into it. I didn't even see the trailers so I was left rather surprised by a twist around the middle (if not sooner). The performances are pretty good, Anne Hathaway in particular shines in this role. The pacing is fast enough even though it sometimes feels like it needed a few more scenes to explain the characters a bit better.Still, the movie is quite good and I especially loved its originality and uniqueness. You asked for original movies, what's the matter now? It's not perfect, but I still recommend it for its originality, good performances and uplifting story.",Colossal

86,RMurray847,This is one crazy film...so inventive and unpredictable.,7,8 January 2021,"This seems to be a good time for movies with misleading trailers. Just as IT COMES AT NIGHT is presented as a horror film (it's not, but because people expected that they hated the film), COLOSSAL bills itself as a comedy. I found parts of it to be darkly hilarious, but it is not a comedy. Again, I see reviews blasting the film for not being what the viewer was led to expect. (I could now insert a full lecture on how the public only seems to like movies that deliver precisely on the expectations they have for them...hence, our sequel happy society.)This movie really can't be categorized. A troubled Anne Hathaway returns to her hometown and sparks up a relationship with Jason Sudeikis, someone she knew from her younger days. Much of the film details their growing relationship...one that is heavily influenced by alcohol. Sudeikis SEEMS to be the nice guy who couldn't quite break away from his claustrophobic hometown, but has gotten by okay by running his own bar. Hathaway went out into the larger world, met a guy that loves her but she just can't quite get on the same page with, and has returned home to lick her psychic wounds.Meanwhile, across the globe in Korea, a Godzilla-like creature has begun to rampage through Seoul, wreaking great havoc during his sudden appearances out of thin air.Believe it or not, these stories are linked. I won't say anymore. I will simply say that the two stars are terrific in this EXTREMELY inventive film. It takes some crazy twists and turns both of plot and character. Folks like Tim Blake Nelson add solid support. You've never seen anything like it. It's like some kind of twisted, millennial fairy tale. The tone is alternately playful and portentous. Funny and uncomfortable. Down-to-earth but larger than life. The final 30 minutes or so are sheer insanity. I sat in my theater seat, happy as heck to be seeing a film I couldn't out-guess, couldn't predict and could take my eyes off.Why not 5 stars? Well, it feels a little stretched. The scenes of Hathaway & Sudeikis, even though well acted, are a bit repetitive. The town Hathaway is visiting seems to have no residents beyond the characters in the film. It's like the movie blew its budget for extras in Korea and had none left for the US! And occasionally, it just goes off the rails tonally. I'm okay with crazy shifts in tone...but when they appear accidental rather than purposeful, it's a problem. It doesn't happen often...but I guess what I'm saying is that the film is a highwire act, and sometimes the aerialist up there wobbles just a bit much.But I doubt we'll have a more off-the-wall film in 2017. I certainly recommend it...but please go in with no expectations as to what you're about to see, and I think you'll like it much more.",Colossal
87,donb-519-335075,Power corrupts . . . . absolute power . . . .,8,17 December 2017,"I'm surprised I liked this one as much as I did. I'm not a fan of today's 30's something ""comedies"" which are all about sex, drunkeness and vulgarity. Sure glad this one did not follow what is popular today.Instead we have an interesting film which teaches us a lot about people - especially those who overcompensate for their humdrum lives. Anne Hathaway is a underachieving, out of work writer who is living an unfulfilling life in NY. She leaves her boy friend and returns home to small time mid-West.At the same time a giant monster attacks Seoul, South Korea. She soons discovers her connection to the monster. Jason Sudeikis is a former boyhood friend who tries to help her out - at least initially.Now, this story is not about monsters (look to the wretched ""Transformers"" series for that). Nor it is about love - well sort of it is - aren't they all? It is a homage to the Japanese Godzilla movies of old - but only in the setting and plot device. It is essentially a story about power - and how it affects and changes people. For other studies on this subject, watch ""Breaking Bad"" the gold standard on the subject, or just study any of the 20th century Presidents. What took ""Breaking Bad"" several series to present, this film does in less than 2 hours.The meaning behind the story (power corrupting) is why I liked the film. If you are a literal person - stay away, you will not like this one. If you are one who cannot ""suspend your disbelief"" - don't bother. But if you like a film which has a challenging plot device and explores relationships and the uses of power, this one is for you.I despise fantasy and am luke-warm about sci-fi, but this one is a winner.

90,texshelters,Interesting and charming in places and too uneven in pacing and story.,7,30 April 2017,"Colossal is a small film with a huge topicThe trailers for ""Colossal"" are misleading. It features Anne Hathaway acting cute, dancing and posing as a monster. Yes, this is adorable, and Hathaway has the ""girl next store"" look to pull it off. But the film is much more than what we see in the previews. If I were to grade the three acts of the film, it would come out B, D, and B+. The beginning is clever and sets up the action well, but not perfectly. For example, Gloria (Anne Hathaway) mentions a few times how terrible she is. However, we never see her darker side. That would add a lot to the drama and the monster we see later. The conflict she has with men and Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) in particular would also be clearer if we knew a little more about Gloria's troubled past. The second act slows down and gets mired in the exposition. While it does reveal important elements of the story, it is inelegant and jarring. The plot points are there, the problem is that Sudeikis can't pull off the creepy reveal the way Jason Bateman did in ""The Gift."" While character issues are often the fault of the script, and the script is in no way guiltless here, I put the failure of the second act on the acting of Sudeikis. Act three fixes the problem as Sudeikis enters his comfort zone as an actor and is no longer asked to be nuanced. The ending saves the film from being another failed attempt at using allegory to create relevant cinema. As difficult as it is to pull off different sets and atmospheres and tone in one film, Colossal blends these elements well. A film that starts as a comedy of errors and then turns into a nightmare is hard to pull off and Colossal does this fairly adeptly. One problem I feel I have to mention is the music. Not everyone likes sappy love songs about broken hearted whiners. I recommend that people who use music in films be careful with the tone of the pieces so that they don't distract from the movie. These might be decent stand alone songs, but in the film, they come off as maudlin.

But of what, and for what purpose? Hathaway's Gloria is deeply flawed but, in line with today's political correctness/ expectations, she leads 3 men around by the nose, only having sex with the one of her choosing. Her character acts in a way which deserves a good slapping, the way you would do to someone who insists on walking off the sidewalk into oncoming traffic.Sudeikis' Oscar seems very helpful, but clearly he has had designs on Gloria all along and his true despicable self soon manifests. NOT - his sudden change of character seems contrived and makes him look as though he has some mental deficiency - perhaps a brain tumor.Boyfriend Tim has this piercing stare and cutting analysis of Gloria's behavioural flaws - but the poor boy is beholden to the girl and can't give her up, even though she keeps him hanging, sometimes for days. Austin, the guy who gets the girl - or rather she gets him - well, he's just sad, and behaves like a little boy throughout, an adult on an overdose of something.If you're like movies which make sense, look elsewhere - stick to ""Based on a true story"".

If you pay attention there are plenty of gags. Hathaway shines and all the rest. It's just NOT the film the trailers lead people to believe, and I really hate that. The trailers filled seats with people who were expecting to see some quirky romcom and instead they got 'Annie Darko' and wound up hating it. And this is a major pet peeve of mine. The same thing happened with ""White God"" This kind of advertising always backfires. The PR dpt just puts together any trailer they think will fill the seats on opening night, then it brings the wrong audience and hurts the film in the long run. Colossal should have been advertised like ""Motorama"" or ""The Dark Backwards""... or ""Eating Raul"". It's a dark edgy comedy and it's not supposed to be of the 'wacky wild hilarity' genre'. OK, it's not a life altering cinema, but it is far better than most of the critiques I've read. And one thing all those critiques had in common...? They all said it wasn't what they were expecting, or it couldn't figure out what it wanted to be. Wrong. The film was exactly what it was trying to be. The viewers just couldn't figure out what it was doing because they all thought it was trying to do something else.... primarily because of the way it was presented. Not that it's easy to describe.

But it certainly would benefit from a few changes.The whole reason for Gloria and Oscar's monster creation event was so trite and stupid. Here I was thinking some sort of life changing trauma occurred in that park. But the terribly unconvincing reason for them to have shared a psychotic break was the boy inexplicable decision to stomp on the girls' diorama, after rescuing it. Pathetic.The way Oscar suddenly became a jealous, stalking, woman-bashing psychopath was freaking ridiculous. It happens way too fast and with no explanation for his swift descent into an unreasonably violent, sarcastic, controlling mental-case. Felt like the producer ambled through the first half of the film and then realised they had to wrap it up quick.I'm not even going to dissect the films' 'message' as the concepts were handled so ineptly.Good idea though poorly scripted. The direction and CGI was great, and the humour and story was (only just) there, but the confusing bits that joined it together makes the ending ultimately unsatisfying.I like Anne Hathaway but in this role she sucks at playing a drunk.

97,keikoyoshikawa,Not A Kaiju Movie,4,1 November 2019,"This movie wasted a really good premise.I'm generally supportive of genre-bending or genre-mixing movies. They can be refreshing and interesting. If done well. Think of the ""Firefly"" series and movie, which mixed sci-fi and western. Sadly, ""Colossal"" misses the mark.To be fair, mixing anything with a Kaiju theme would be difficult to pull off. ""Colossal"" made this challenge even more impossible by focusing the story on characters and situations that in the end are inconsequential. In other words, there is no momentous reveal or resolution that is remotely interesting.Moreover, ""Colossal"" turns out to be not even a real Kaiju movie. It uses a giant monster as merely a prop what is basically a tale of millennial angst. This is a travesty to both genres. Worse, the actors are totally miscast and the plot so boring that it seems this was a movie conceived and made during a drunken bout of truth or dare.It is a real shame. For one, the otherwise talented actors are wasted. And so is the premise. Which begs the question: Can anything be well-made if using Kaiju as a backdrop?

It happens that movies don't do good, because people have expectations and the movie, although good, is something else entirely. Blade Runner for instance being a case in point.This movie got a lot of good reviews, but I think that you still either need to know what to expect or not expect anything at all and just sit, enjoy it, and take the story in. It's a story that gets quite sad at times, especially when it progresses, and it's very much about what the kicked out of her boyfriend's apartment now ex-girlfriend needs to do: figuring out what her life, what people, and what she herself is all about, and above all, just taking care of the mess her life has become.With a funny twist at the end also, we aren't exactly sure how life is going to progress, but we are sure what she managed to leave behind ... and it isn't what you'd expect it to be at the beginning of the movie, although it's most definitely in there somewhere.I thoroughly enjoyed it and felt pleasantly sad finishing it.

101,ivans536,Missing crucial character development,2,10 June 2019,"Although the premise seems interesting and the cast is both competent and lovable, this movie still ends up being a clunker.Firstly the script; while there are funny moments (not really jokes), it seems to be missing a crucial 15 minutes where the male character develops from a loving guy to a psycho. Or, if we are to believe he was a psycho all along, we still lack a couple of scenes of foreshadowing.Secondly, the premise. Although it seems interesting at first, it ends up being a crutch for the lazy writing to keep Hathaway in the town and is mostly thrown aside throughout the 2nd third of the movie instead of being utilised and explored more, ending as more of a gimmick than an actual premise. The same is done with 2 of the 5 speaking characters who seem to be thrown aside about halfway in, just disappearing except for a finale cameo.Thirdly, the acting. While the leads are both very competent actors, they are both incapable of playing drunks. We are told they are drunks but never really see them act in a drunk way, except for the male being more rude but all the while looking as polished a s ever. This is even worse with Hathaway's character who is always as dolled up and charming as if going in for a job interview, although we are supposed to buy she just woke up from being blackout drunk.And finally, the message. While the final.act seems to be about overcoming bullies and showing real strength, this doesn't seem to be the right movie to preach that message. Hathaway repeatedly bullies the male character and physically assaults him on multiple occasions while we are supposed to consider him the bad guy for replying verbally. Furthermore, he is only shown to be a perfect gentleman before this and definitely not worth the abuse he gets. Another similar situation is when after being slapped he still doesn't fire Hathaway but she then ends up feeling insulted when he asks her to do her job later on in the night.All in all, a pretty uneven mess, and one of the worst movies of 2016.",Colossal

Yeah sure, initially you're thinking ""another crappy Godzilla"" movie, but as they say ""never judge a book by its cover"". The movie is full of surprises, showcases some great acting (and I don't often say or write this), has a story that may touch a number of emotional strings for quite a number of people roaming around on this planet (covering topics like abuse, violence, alcohol, non- functional relationships, emotional blackmail etc.). Sometimes it made me wonder whether or not Colossal was trying to deal with too many issues at the same time (otherwise I would have rated it even higher). So, yes, this movie was most definitely worthwhile watching, and Godzilla, well... judge yourself, but I don't think it was playing any sorts of lead role in this movie, and that worked just fine for me.

But I thought ""Giant monsters and Robots even my daughter is kind of turned off about it."" Me? As a big fan of Kaiju (giant monsters defined as strange beasts - my favorite: Godzilla), I have to say, this is not your average Japanese rendition of mayhem, or the bs, of ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), and regardless of cheering up for Del Toro (We both were born ""Mexicanos""), it happens, that Nacho Vigalondo from Spain, beat Guillermo to the punch! ""Time Crimes"" (2007), also written and directed by Vigalondo wasn't all of what I expected, as ""confusing time travel movies"" I so much prefer the highly unknown ""Primer"" (2004). So I prepared myself for a possible disappointment while thinking ""the ending is going to be with kisses and hugs, and tears and joy , yeah, yeah,... another love story."" Seriously, I believed that ""Oscar"" (Jason Sudeikis) was just trying to teach ""Gloria"" (Anne Hathaway) a visual, hard tough lesson about life, and above all what alcohol was doing to her, so he could held her in his arms and up close and say: ""I am sorry Gloria all I did was for our own good, because I Love you"" .Most movies will cheer up (or not) anyone's evening, unless they are watching something like ""Leaving las Vegas"" (1995), or remind you of personal struggle with addictions, yes I applaud the effort of reminding the audience about excessive drinking in a less serious way.Definitely, there is something twistily funny, to the crappy lives of each and every one of the characters, making the story a little ""sad"" if you think too much into it. Above all, their broken relationships even with friends, as it shows in the scene where ""Garth"" (Tim Blake Nelson) walks out of the bar...still the actors and writers don't give you the space for mopping.""Colossal"" has some flaws, the CGI could have been better, but the people in charge did the right choice, getting the heavy weight on the story and the acting. And is one of those movies I long for, where I went wrong on guessing and predicting what was about to happen next, most of the time.After this, Anne Hathaway is convincing me that she can be a real actress.Final thoughts.Regardless of being brain washed on the premise that Hollywood movies must have happy endings (and being a man), still, I am some kind of romantic and for a moment I wanted that ""Joel"" and ""Gloria"" ending up together as benefit of both, no spoiler here! because for the first time in my life I walked out as soon as the screen went black and credits were about to roll (I needed to rush to a different place) truth to be told, the cynic in me prefers the bitter -sweet ending!.* I just remembered the opposite to ""Colossal"" that is: ""Blood Trap"" (2015) a trapping fortress and baby vampires? good premise in every way, worst visuals and epic failure! *But ""Colossal"" I will watch again as a ""valued entertainment"" and definitely I hope for a sequel.P.S The rating should be better than Pacific Rim, better story, while having less CGI and ""Monster/robots""",Colossal
105,NavyOrion,Quirky but enjoyable,7,5 June 2017,"Absolutely the best feminist empowerment sci-fi comedy drama giant monster movie you'll ever see. And, very likely the only one.Anne Hathaway gives a typically good performance, one that is matched by that of her costar Jason Sudeikis. Tim Blake is also good, though underutilized (he is driven away by Sudeikis' increasingly douche-bag character well before the final act.) Dan Stevens and Austin Stowell were merely props.One warning: Do not go to see this movie but then get indignant because ""it doesn't make sense!"" If you have to have all your sci-fi completely explained and believable (a test: does it still annoy you that all the Star Trek aliens are humanoid?) then this one will really irritate you. Get over it! You're missing the forest for the trees! Forget the ""how"" and concentrate on the ""what."" This is high-concept stuff: what would happen if a girl discovered that she was behind the sudden intermittent appearance of a giant monster in Seoul? ""Colossal"" competently answers that question. (To the extent that the concept was ""explained"" at all, I'll just say this: getting hit by lightning while angry over someone trashing your homework apparently has really interesting consequences.)It's a small story, but a good one, and well-executed. Kudos to the filmmakers, and to two fairly big stars (three if you count the wasted opportunity of Tim Blake) who were willing to take a chance on a movie that will never be a blockbuster, but was enjoyable nonetheless.",Colossal

It has that dream like fugue, where reality and the impossible collides in dreams. Quite frankly I don't know how to rate this. Did I like it? I haven't figured that out yet. Hathaway is good, and Jason Sudeikis is fantastic in this role. Maybe this is a reality play on how even regular people can affect the world. Your guess would be good as mine, even though you haven't seen it yet. Most of this movie meanders, and you cant get any sort of feel as to where its going. Possibly that's the intent of the producer, director and writer, so that it resembles real life as much as possible, juxtaposed with well, magic. But one thing is for sure. Putting monsters into your everyday life, has never been stranger. It has a great ending, that's as strange as the rest of the movie. I give it a 7 of 10. Its worth the watch. I think.",Colossal
109,scottingram,Colossal Film Review,8,26 May 2017,"The new sci-fi drama comedy monster mash up film Colossal starring Anne Hathaway, Dan Stevens, Jason Sudeikis, Tim Blake Nelson, Austin Stowell. In Colossal Gloria (American actress Anne Hathaway - The Dark Knight Rises, Interstellar) is an out-of-work party girl who finds herself in relationship trouble with her sensible boyfriend, Tim (English actor Dan Stevens - UK TV Series Downton Abbey, The Guest), and is forced to move back to her tiny hometown to get her life back on track. She reconnects with childhood friend Oscar (American actor Jason Sudeikis - We're The Millers, Horrible Bosses films), a good- natured bar owner with a coterie of drinking buddies Garth and Joel (American actor Tim Blake Nelson - Lincoln, Kill The Messenger as Garth and American actor Austin Stowell - Bridge Of Spies, Whiplash as Joel), and resumes her drinking lifestyle. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, a larger-than-life creature begins attacking Seoul, South Korea on a nightly basis, captivating spectators around the world. One night, Gloria is horrified to discover a connection between these catastrophic events and her own fractured psyche. Deconstructing the monster movie genre in wildly imaginative ways, Spanish writer-director Nacho Vigalondo (TIMECRIMES, EXTRATERRESTRIAL, OPEN WINDOWS) unleashes a fantastical tale that also triumphs as a wholly original and subversive romantic comedy. Amongst the other actors / actresses in Colossal include Canadian actress Hannah Cheramy as Young Gloria, Nathan Ellison as Young Oscar and Canadian actress Rukiya Bernard (The Unspoken, That Burning Feeling) as Maggie. Filming locations in Colossal include places around the world like New York, US State of Maine, New England, USA, Seoul the capital of South Korea, Asia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Overall Colossal is a good sci-fi drama comedy monster mash up film filled with a monster, a robot, some weird bizarre moments, some violence, fights, punch ups, people drinking and getting drunk, arguments, swearing, tongue and cheek stuff, some scary moments, some funny moments, friendship, flashbacks, flashing scenes and other things throughout the film. So I will give Colossal an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Colossal is worth seeing if you like films similar to this like Godzilla, Cloverfield, Chronicle, Project Almanac amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Colossal in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Colossal
110,rogier-86785,"Very, very good",8,6 October 2019,"Colossal uses all emotions available to show us how destructive we are to ourselves, whether it's by nature or through substance abuse. Thankfully it uses humor too too, plus of course the curious 'monster' connection which I will not spoil for you. Let's say it shouldn't work this well, but somehow it does.It's not a great film per sé but it's very smart in getting to its points across, landing it my eight points.

112,victoryismineblast,Hathaway shines in surprisingly dark Godzilla homage,7,2 May 2017,"Anne Hathaway shines in this sci-fi monster movie that successfully blends a mishmash of styles and sub-genres in a very effective way. Portraying out of work party girl Gloria, she is effectively kicked out of her posh digs by her boyfriend when he realizes he can no longer put up with her constant drunken antics, and finds she must move back home to an empty house in her hometown.There she is reunited with her childhood friend Oscar, aptly played by Jason Sudeikis. Broke and without friends, Gloria accepts a job at Oscar's bar. Oscar's intentions toward her, though, remain a mystery until it is revealed that a giant monster is stomping its way through Seoul, killing people and destroying buildings. Gloria finds she has a strong connection to this creature. Here is where some well done comedy is thrown into the mix and the film pays quiet homage to the Godzilla films of yore.The movie is well paced and never slows down for very long. Although flashbacks attempt to explain the reasons for what is going on, this isn't done very well and that is perhaps the only drawback to the film. One of Oscar's drinking buddies, Garth, portrayed by character actor Tim Blake Nelson, is particularly well written and acted and adds a nice humorous element.All in all this is a satisfying and entertaining movie that won't disappoint genre fans or the casual monster movie viewer. 7/10.",Colossal

Okay, was it something about the monsters that live inside us?No so much. Good, dependable actors, doing their best in service to a misbegotten idea. Who thought ""Hey, we can make a comedy about a relationship that turns abusive...and we get to punch Ann Hathaway a couple of times!""

114,javi-y-se-acabo,"A Colossal Anne Hathaway Carries Much Part of This Movie About Monsters, Alcohol and Consequences.",7,7 September 2017,"Well, this is my first movie of Nacho Vigalondo and I must admit that I really didn't know what to expect from it, because I had read that it was a movie about Anne Hathaway being drunk, and a monster somehow related with her and it all had to do with the consequences of our actions in life. Well this might be confusing but it tells us the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway) a girl who drinks a lot and who is forced to leave her home in New York, where she live with his boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens), and she tries to start over in the village where she grew up and where she has a childhood friend, Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). She slowly comes to the realization that a monster that has appeared in Seoul is somehow connected with her. The story is original at the least and it's very well introduced to us with the use of the news images and YouTube videos to connect the monster to Hathaway's character. But don't watch expecting something like Cloverfield with a monster destroying a city and so. It tells us the story of how Gloria reacts to this connection and what she does to manage that situation. The thing that really didn't worked for me was the explanation of this connection, that I won't spoil, and some aspects of the end of the movie, and that leaves you a bit confused at the end, but the movie overall is great.Anne Hathaway is fantastic in the role of Gloria and he carries the movie through its whole duration. She has a feeling of sadness and innocence at the same time that help you connect with her character very fast. Also Jason Sudeikis is great as the childhood friend of Gloria, Oscar. I won't spoil anything but his character gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on. The other actors don't do a lot, because they're secondary characters and they don't play a big part in the movie.The visuals of the monster and then of the robot are great and surprised me, because of the fact that is not a big budget movie, but they managed to create a frightening monster with not much money. Also the soundtrack is a mix of great songs with the score created by Bear McCreary that captures perfectly the feeling of darkness and mystery through some parts of the movie.I would highly recommend you the movie if you like to be surprised with almost unknown movies, and I suppose that also to the Nacho Vigalondo fans, because I think this movie has a similar feeling to his other movies. Also, watch it knowing the less you can, and you will enjoy it more.",Colossal

It proved to be an amazing film which grows on you if you give it chance. A bit like Birdman (if you liked that film you would like this one and probably if you hated it, this film is not for you) in scope with a surreal story but down to earth execution of it.
Admittedly the characters could have been written in a more sympathetic or at least more rounded but I never felt the film boring. This film is drama and comedy intertwined, with drama becoming more pronounced as the film nears its end. The story concerns the falling down of an alcoholic woman (Anne Hathaway) with her boyfriend and a childhood friend. But it also about our untold stories or our stories/deep experience others refuse to hear or do not pay attention to.

117,walkingwithprimeval,What's this rubbish?,3,13 December 2020,"Instead of making a fun, action-packed, summer monster movie, this bloke made some pretentious, artsy-fartsy, indie dramedy which warns about the dangers of alcoholism and being a totally uncharismatic lead character who the audience can't root for (or something along those vague lines, anyway). Honestly now, this movie is just plain old rubbish and doesn't make any sense, which would be fine and dandy if it was at least entertaining to watch... but it isn't! Which leaves me asking, ""What the heck was this guy trying to accomplish, here? What was his goal?"" I've tried rewatching it over and over again, but I can't seem to find any deeper meaning hidden away beneath it all.Colossal (2017) was marketed to the masses as a quirky creature feature and it's not even all that funny. A darkly comedic take on the kaiju genre isn't a bad idea in theory, with 2017's Kong: Skull Island successfully managing to amuse the viewer with its moments of dark comedy. But when put into practice with Colossal (2017), it didn't turn out so good. Really now, the only semi-humorous parts were whenever Jason Sudeikis was acting out as Anne Hathaway's mean boss. And I suppose the other redeemable thing this movie has going for it is the CGI which, considering it's fairly low-budget, was pretty well done.Call me a moron all you want for not ""understanding it"" or ""getting the point of it all"", but to me it's just a stupid movie. Now, if you want to see a well-thought-out, experimental giant monster film that's legitimately GREAT, then I'd gladly recommend Cloverfield from 2008 (WARNING: if you're prone to any motion sickness at all, then it's probably for the best if you don't bother with watching it). I'll tell you one thing, it's runtime is mercifully shorter than what Colossal's was.",Colossal
118,ReelLifeReviews,A solid original,7,22 April 2017,"Colossal - Surrounded by endless sequels and pointless remakes, Colossal stands tall as a truly unique film. A slow start and some stark tonal shifts not withstanding, this was a pleasant surprise.Anne Hathaway can be hit or miss for me, but she was excellent here. She plays a blackout-prone alcoholic that for some reason can conjure a giant monster that destroys parts of Korea. Remember when I said this was a unique film? She presents great range with her character, easily juggling between being quirky, powerful, funny, and completely vulnerable. Oscars might be pushing it, but I'd say she would be almost a lock for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy.That's the other thing; this movie was almost entirely advertised as a comedy. There are definitely comedic elements throughout, but it marches headstrong through some pretty heavy territory. There were times where I felt downright uncomfortable with actions taken by certain characters.Jason Sudeikis plays opposite of Anne Hathaway and really brings it with his performance. I haven't had a big sample size of his work, only catching him in bit parts or in a few sketches on SNL years ago, but I was impressed. His character arc seemed a little rushed, however. I didn't feel like he had a chance to portray a natural progression.As stated previously, this movie takes a while to find its footing. The first 20 minutes or so is just one long introduction of Hathaway's character that seemed far too drawn out. There is a side character that is basically just a fly on the wall and makes zero impact to the story as a whole. They are put in situations where any rational human being would do, or at the very least say, something to help, but it's like they aren't even present. There were two major moments in the film that were almost illogical due to their inaction.Stories like this deserve an audience. We clamor for originality at the theater, but when we're offered a title that isn't a popular IP or doesn't include a cinematic universe, the empty seats speak far louder. This isn't a perfect film, but it's definitely worth your time. Is it a little on the nose that it's a story about an alcoholic destroying the world around her? Sure. But it's all in the execution.",Colossal
119,trelerke-politics,Great allegory on how the US Empire obliviously flattens other places a half planet away,9,4 September 2017,"First, if Tim Blake Nelson is in the movie, it's probably AWESOME !!!! (Until proved otherwise) he even does a little comedy dance thingy that has plot relevance. He's kind of the Tom Wait's of actors, well, the younger version of Harry Dean Stanton being the Tom Waits of actorswhere were we, oh yeah, Colossal, right. It's probably the best urban/rural romance science fiction, political allegory movie of the year. (tee hee) Anne Hatheway plays a dissipated urban gen- x –er, off-tract, kicked out by the boyfriend, standard US rom-com setup, goes back to her upstate beginnings and then the movie veers off – A Godzilla like monster starts to destroy large parts of downtown Seoul, always appearing at the same time then disappearing, and it slowly starts to dawn on her that she is the monster, her blackouts and other random behavior playing out as large scale destruction of a city half a planet away. The plot thickens as the seemingly friendly ""stayed in the home town"" childhood friend turns out to be angry nuts and intertwined with the whole city killing monster trope. The origin story of the monsters is besides the point except that local angry nuts guy stomped on her city of Seoul primary school project, as science fiction/horror lightening strikes them both, thus Seoul is randomly brought into play (this scene explains the first scene of the movie, a Barbie doll helps embed US cultural influence, as a little fillip). And that's where the movie becomes amazing – we are now presented with the stark truth that the way in which Americans play out their little crazy lives here, our lifestyles, our political choices, our internally almost invisible yet externally super impactful empire, has massive effects across the planet. (The US uses 25 percent of the world's energy, it takes empire to do that). Some of the more humanizing plot points and final denouement are a bit off point, but this didn't bother me, that I was watching a well made allegory about US empire more than made up for such Hollywood pragmatics (the whole ""you f__king b_tch"" as he's being threatened by a two hundred foot monster, was way too convenient). Interestingly, there has been movies by Korean director, Bong Joon- Hu that deal with large scale human caused issues, pollution (The Host ), class (Snow Piercer) and factory farming (Okja), not sure this is related to Colossal, but it's at least an interesting coincidence. The fact that this movie got little distribution in the US is telling and to be expected, it's complex and incredibly critical of US power in the world.",Colossal

He always sacrifices characters towards his ideas and plots, and they end up chaotic and inhuman. These people make no sense: ""I just killed a million Koreans. Oops. What should I do? I know! I'll get drunk again and show my new friends how cool it is to mass murder.""""I'm going to have a hissy fit and kill a million Koreans just because it makes me feel big and because I want to control a girl.

Should I get my friends to hold him down? Demonstrate this phenomenon to the police and have him arrested? Maybe sit with him and convince him not to commit mass-murder? Nah, I'll go to Korea and kill him."" ""I had to dump her because she was intolerable when drunk. But now that she is even worse and slept with other people, I want her back.""

Unfortunately, while the premise holds multitudes of promises and possibilities - for some strange reason, or just a total lack of imagination beyond the initial concept, the director/writer chooses a tone too low-key, a path too uneven, and the entire movie simply loiters, fumbles and meanders along without any enticing characterisation nor identity to hold up its lofty titling.It is one of those movies which held such promise, but in the end cannot decide what it wants to be, and simply goes for a little of everything and ends up nothing very much, far far from the heights it could have been. While it tries to be different, what we eventually get is the reverse - bits of clichés from all sorts of genre - romcom, city girl in a small town, nice guy to dark guy, spoof, satire, black comedy, slapstick, fantasia, sci-fi, monsters & robots in the city, you name it ... none convincing nor properly developed, ending up with a pointless whimper in every category.Anne Hathaway does try to hold it together, but the meandering hesitant plot and script just don't allow the actress (and her fellow actors) to gain a firm footing to propel the characters and movie forward - which indeed just got stuck in jerky low gear throughout.Colossal waste of opportunity is what it finally is ... could have gone to very enticing places ... but it just didn't wanna have fun, didn't wanna get down to the groove, .... sput .... sput .... sputter .... end.",Colossal

Unfortunately, the interpersonal relationships and internal issues the characters face (obviously manifested in the monsters) are mostly used to facilitate unneeded plot points -While giving great performances, Hathaway's character in the film is a boring and clumsy character, who's motivations gain her next to no payoff (Looking at you, ending scene). Sudeikis on the other hand, plays an overly nice guy who's character changes come out of no where but leave him overacted (his rant in the bar comes to mind)-The side characters are a disaster, especially concerning that one scene about cocaine useGive it a watch if it pops up on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but there's definitely better film to watch in the near two hour run time",Colossal

It really is a underrated movie.It reminded me of 'Another Earth' another sci fi gem of taking a simple story and sprinkling a little sci fi on it.How they squeezed in some dark humour into this without turning it into a farce impressed me quite a bit. It didn't ruin it at all but added to the enjoyment of the story. Anne Hathaway can give you a little comic turn without losing the dramatic theme. There was a danger of taking itself too seriously as a Sci Fi film but avoided that well too. The Sci Fi element is just a way of expressing a good little emotional drama.Really well casted in the key roles. I won't look at Jason Sudeikis in the same light again. And Anne Hathaway did her filmography some good with accepting this role. I thought the boyfriend a bit weak but he is supplementary to the plot.I credit any film under 2 hours, so many movies nowadays pad for pad's sake thinking they need to give running time for value.

131,albertusjohannesmaria,I understand this movie,9,20 July 2017,"Colossal is a movie that I had to write something about, considered so many negative reviews here, which I think this movie doesn't deserve. On one side of the picture there is Anne and Jason who once were childhood sweethearts, on the other side, in South Korea, a gigantic monster and a robot, tower over Seoul. At some point during the story the synchronization between the two different entities becomes obvious, just as the fights between the opponents becomes tougher. All this time you hope they will make up in the end. In it's core Colossal is a very sad story. Disappointment over ourselves as well as disappointed over our closest persons. Life's misfortunes made us not exactly hero's and neihter does it to the ones we love. These things happen at personal level with Anne and Jason and they are also universal, and I think that is why the story was literally over the top synchronized in Seoul. Colossal avoids cliché's like they never avoid them in Hollywood. Some scenes have a European art house atmosphere, others scenes look like a romcom or a Hollywood blockbuster. Anne and Jason act wonderfully, really a delight to see them here, in a daring movie that isn't a crowd pleaser. This movie, directed by Spaniard Nacho Vigalondo, reminds me of the movies by South African director Neill Blomkamp, like District 9 and Chappie. They have something in common, mixing social issues with fantasy and science fiction.",Colossal
132,Metal_Robots,Better and very different to what the trailer portrays,6,20 May 2017,"Just watched Colossal, the Anne Hathaway film. A bizarre premise, using surrealist metaphors and suggestion (a bit like Being John Malkovich, Donnie Darko or Terry Gilliam's Tideland for instance) to make observations on real things like drug addiction, alcoholism and abusive relationships. Actually quite good if you liked the afore-mentioned comparisons.One thing i'd say is, it's not perfect but it's a lot darker (and better) than the trailer makes it out to be. It has black humour but it certainly is not the fun comedy that the trailer (and its ridiculously upbeat music which is nowhere in the film, thankfully!) makes it appear, and the ending is DEFINITELY not funny! I guess the studio was somewhat lazily and dishonestly trying to go for an angle that would sell it, as the strangeness of the film means the real point of it could not be easily conveyed in a short trailer.",Colossal

The final scene had me crying like a baby. Although it's branded as a comedy (and there are some funny scenes), it's simply about the way we are as human beings, the way we relate to one another, the way we carry ridiculous emotional baggage around with us and either transcend it or allow it to poison our souls to the point where some of us just can't be fixed, and it tells us all this in a refreshing, entertaining and memorable way.

This is what makes a film desired, the adjectives that the spectator feels flooding the heart and mind, immediately after the film is finished. We are in need of such originality and freshness, like that ""alternative"" form that this film is ""branded"" with. We need to feel a certain completion of our expectations and feel refreshed, renewed.Monsters? We have seen a lot of them, numerous to be exact.

136,anthony-burton4,Not a comedy!,8,18 January 2018,"I enjoyed this movie, but it's nothing like what I expected.The movie poster and the trailer are rather misleading really, because they suggest a light-hearted movie, which this certainly isn't. It has light hearted, funny moments, but in the main it covers some pretty serious issues connected with power and personal freedom.In particular, I liked the fact that all the characters are pretty real, although there is a little stereotyping going on at times. The main character reminds me of Thelma from Thelma and Louise - a rather ditsy character, with a controlling partner, who comes across initially as a bit hopeless, but shows good character in the end.This isn't a movie for kids - it covers some pretty dark topics including domestic abuse - it probably deals with them in the lightest way possible, but it's still quite powerful.In short, it's well worth taking the time to watch - it's NOT a monster movie!",Colossal

The story is amazing; it really keeps you on edge as events unfold, and the actors have all done a fantastic job. Love it when you can't guess what's gonna happen in every other scene. That said, there were a few things that didn't make sense to me; I didn't see how they contributed to the development of the story, but they were few and far between. All in all, this is exactly what I want a movie to be: A magical story that seemingly doesn't have any connections to real life, except when you think about it there's more to it than meets the eye.",Colossal

They call it an action/comedy, but the whole monster part is to act as an allegory of much serious issues, and to ease the digestion of such Adult Scary(TM) movie. If you ever struggled with either too much or too little control in your life, do yourself a favour and watch Colossal. It has much better pacing than I expected and steadily introduces us to its depths in multiple dimensions. Not extremely deep, as the fantastic theme doesn't let it go too far as to make the experience disturbing--and good, because I wouldn't even watch it otherwise. I have a feeling it was a very deliberate trick; the whole creation seems ridden with those, and I love it. It's hard to talk about it in a fitting way without spoilers, but I will try: it's a story about control, power, discipline and abuse. It begins with a complete absence of those and shifts to create a colossal imbalance, and then to resolve it through catharsis. Guilt evolves into responsibility, and as the main character's name would suggest, it is glorious.",Colossal
139,Songwriter_90210,Colossal Let Down,4,5 June 2017,"I need to confess a bias: I love Anne Hathaway. Her crazy, wide eyed, expression-filled face makes me happy, even when she's being less than totally interesting. Like she is in this movie. Admittedly, there's not much for her to do, because the movie, to me, lacks direction. I can tell there was an interesting concept initially, probably thought up during a hardcore pot smoking session, but it never made it to the screen. There are simply too many times that I found myself wondering why in the heck did the movie decide to take that turn? That's really good when the answers are available to discover through an interesting, unwinding plot, but really bad when there is really no justification for it at all. This movie leaves more questions than it answers, and I've been thinking about it for two days. And no, it's not the kind of thinking about it that means it was so good you can't stop thinking about it. No. It was the kind of preoccupation with something that becomes irritating and a nuisance. This movie was a waste of time for me. It is not substantive, did not showcase the actors well, had a poor and confusing story, and made no discernible point. If it tried to, it literally contradicted itself. You think it's going to be a cautionary tale. Nope! Then you think it might be a romance flick. Nope! A fish out of water comedy? Um... no. Oh, I know! It's a good old fashioned monster movie! NOPE! Not THAT!!Bottom line is it wanted to be so much, it never became anything. That's never any fun. I gave it a 6 for... you know what? I'm not going to give it a 6. It deserves a 4. Let me go change that... Sorry Anne. I love your silly, lovely face, but you just have to do better.",Colossal
140,martin-807-452270,3/5 Not bad. Nachos and beer in a pub.,6,31 May 2017,"****SPOILERS********SPOILERS********SPOILERS******* So today I went to see Colossal the the Odeon Covent garden which is a really great cinema as there is never anyone there and they always show the slightly more off the wall movies, the seats are however extraordinarily uncomfortable, and It kinda made me want to leave! To carry on with the food theme of my last few reviews this film was like meeting up with a long lost school friend for beer and nachos in a pub. You know the sort of thing: you are walking down the road minding your own business when someone catches your eye - you know you know them, but you can't place it so you stop and look proper and that's when they look at you, and it's too late to look away when you realise it's that bloke from school who was quite nice but a bit dull, and before you know it you're having a chat and he's saying we should have a beer, and before you can say ""yeah in another 20 years dick face"" you find yourself inexplicably saying, ""well I've got nothing going on tonight - fancy a beer? We can catch up on old times!?"" and the bastard says ""Hey that's great!"" and you suddenly find yourself in a pub you used to go to 20 years ago, but it's all been done up and it's not how it was, and the music is just a little too loud so you keep saying ""what?"" all the time. You chat for a bit and at first it's really exciting because he has got some information about a few people you wanted to know about, like the bloke you sat next to in Maths, and apparently he married a Canadian and now lives in Calgary, which you are never going to go to and you ask if the person you liked in the 5th form is still around and dick face says ""Oh yes they are doing really well - they are store manager of the Ladbrokes by the station,"" and that's great for them, but you know you are not going to pop in, and they were going to be a rock star and be on Top of The Pops and everything, but now you are struggling and you ask how Colin is and his Mum died and it's all a bit awkward so you order some nachos, as they are loads of fun and not too expensive and you can both pick at them until there is only the huge lump of re-formed cheese like some sort of hideous tumour cut out of a Chernobyl technician's gut. That's how this film was. Really exciting at the beginning, I thought - this film maker has a voice and Ann Hathaway has the most amazing hair, but then quite quickly the magic began to trickle away. Plot points were rammed home a few more times than were necessary and a whole subplot with a useless English boyfriend (who also had wonky teeth - is this too much of a Cliché' these days?) which was completely cuttable the film hits a bump in the road. And stays on this bumpy road for a good half hour before deciding that they should probably get on with it and finish the movie, which they do in an extraordinarily predictable manner. No surprises here. I can totally see how this film was written, the director and his long lost mate in the pub saying, ""wouldn't it be brilliant if this girl was like a huge Colossal monster in Korea!"" and they both fall about laughing and that's it. Lovely hair Ann has no real character arc to fulfil and at the end of the movie she is just back at square 1. It just seemed very odd. It was full of really great moments, and some lovely ideas, some of the dialogue was coo, but the total lack of chemistry between any of the four main characters led me to look at my watch several times and I was really hoping for some super clever reveal at the end or a sting in the tail, but there was none. Even the motivation for the nasty man to be nasty was a bit feeble and in the end I was ready for the end. It's not bad - but it's not brilliant, just like that evening in the pub with the slightly boring bloke from school. Ann is excellent and deserved to be given a slightly more encompassing role, yes she's an alcoholic we get that but she needs to be more than that IMHO. 3/5 Not bad.

141,HalBanksy,A waste of an interesting concept...,4,16 April 2018,"The premise is entertaining, and certainly original, but I feel there's a lack of a bigger picture here. What is the message and drive of this film? - Addiction? Loneliness? Insignificance? Maturity? I felt it was approaching these topics at times but never quite got there.Jason Sudeikis deserves specific mention. This is literally some of the strangest acting I have ever seen. I don't understand any of the motivations behind his character at all. Rarely funny, just bizarre and often creepy. This isn't a layered deep performance, just a confusing one.The tone is all over the place. One moment a giant monster is impersonating Pulp Fiction, the next a woman is being savagely beaten up.

The manipulative behaviors of the men around Gloria, blatantly obvious, with the worst hidden behind ""I love You facade's"". You couldn't help but feel for Gloria as she stumbled her way to finding the courage to make some kind of stand to entrapment. The sci-fi surface story was pretty well told, and the flashbacks kept you wondering ""How did this happen""? All the actors were spot on. Timing, and chemistry were riveting, (Loved Anne Hathaway in this!), and really start to drive nails into each other around the middle of the film.

150,emms75,Another example of what Vigalondo does best.,7,24 May 2017,"Colossal, written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, is refreshingly a million miles away from much of the dull Hollywood predictability that often keeps me away from my local multiplex. I have been a fan of quirky independent films forever, and having particularly enjoyed this writer/director's previous creations, including Los Cronocrimines (2007), and Extraterrestre (2011), I was tempted to swim to America to see it on its earlier US release date. Sadly I couldn't find my arm bands, so I had to wait until this morning. The basic synopsis doesn't sound too far off from some of the Hollywood sausage factory films that bore me rigid: Gloria is an out-of-work party girl forced to leave her life in New York City, and move back home. When reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, she gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon. - IMDbBut its Vigalondo's usual 'unusualness' that sets this film apart from mainstream mediocrity. The most significant quirk is a massive genre shift that initially left me feeling that the film was a 'nutribullet-ing' together of Cloverfield with The Girl on the Train. What initially appears to be a run-of-the-mill film about a semi- alcoholic woman being dumped by her boyfriend, without warning transforms into a full-on Kaiju monster movie. The story is delivered via a competent mix of humour, suspense and surprise – all carried by a script that is both crisp and much more authentic than many other current offerings. The film is not without a few niggles however. Although it is a relief to see a film so many miles away from Hollywood convention, at times I found myself frustrated that it seemed to have stalled a few yards short of an alternative destination. The pace was a little inconsistent - some parts had me completely hooked but in others my suspense was not about 'what' would happen next, but rather 'when'. Occasionally the part comedy / part serious genre mix left me feeling a bit uncertain. At some points I wasn't sure if the audience was supposed to laugh or be outraged. This uncertainty may have been the maker's intention, but I have to say it restricted my enjoyment of the film. On leaving the cinema I had several unanswered questions regarding the credibility of some of the characters' actions, which was a little frustrating. Despite these issues, the story on the whole was complete and provided a satisfying outcome. On balance my eager anticipation of this film was rewarded, and even with the glitches it was far more worthy of nearly two hours of my life and more enjoyable to talk about than anything else I have seen this year. I would gladly watch ten films like Colossal than any of the formulaic rehashes that were trailered before it started. Go see it! Emma x",Colossal

On arriving home she meets her old school 'friend' who now owns a bar - they get drunk, a lot, she works for him (in a bar great choice)... meanwhile in Seoul a giant monster is attacking and smashing the odd building and stomping on people.This she discovers is a direct link to her own actions - at 8:05am on a school playground...Whilst drunk (they are always drunk did I mention that) she tells her three main bar friends this....I cannot go on much longer.Now if you have a drink problem, an AA member or have been a bully in your past then you may relate to some of this.

156,soxlade,Curious fantasy drama is flawed but still worth a look,7,29 May 2017,"Colossal is a film from Spanish director Nacho Vigalondo. It stars Anne Hathaway as Gloria, a thirty-something wastrel who would much rather be out all night drinking with her friends than growing up, getting a job etc.When she is dumped by her boyfriend (Dan Stevens, channeling Hugh Grant) and kicked out of the flat they share, she returns to her hometown and the rental house her parents own where she almost immediately meets old school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) who not only has always had feelings for his old school friend, but also happens to own a bar and employs Gloria as a waitress.One drunken evening ends with Gloria spending the night on a playground bench, the same night a giant monster appears over Seoul wreaking havoc. Gloria slowly begins to realise that she may have something to do with this event, in fact the monster may actually be her...This is a strange film, let's be frank - you ain't going to see something like this again this, or any, year. It is like a Godzilla film seen through the prism of indie self-improvement films like Garden State. Or, if you prefer, something akin to Juno with a Kaiju.It is a film that is a little unsure of itself, despite the brilliant idea at its core. It is not a comedy, though it is fitfully amusing and the presence of Sudeikis, nor is it a 'growing up' movie, instead it is closer to a monster movie, but the monsters involved are not necessarily the obvious green stompy thing flattening Seoul, more the monsters that live within each and every one of us. However it never quite pulls all of its themes and plot threads together satisfactorily, perhaps it never could, and its tone is a little uneven in places. This is a film that does not go where you think the premise might take it. This is a surprisingly dark film, with unapologetic, unlikable characters that are obsessed with nihilistic, destructive emotions and struggle to repress and control them when really they wish to embrace them.Hathaway, as far away from her traditional elfin princess appearance as she's ever been, is effective as Gloria, though we never really warm to her. It is a measure of the actress's skill that we are clearly not meant to ever love and root for Gloria, but we do wish the best for her, we hope she makes the 'right' choices that would assist her goal to get her life under control even though we know, deep down, she's hopeless. Peering out from under an unflattering fringe, hair unkempt and unbrushed, black eye make-up and cracked lips she bears an uncanny resemblance to UK TV presenter Claudia Winkleman. Hers is a performance of charm, darkness, obsession, addiction and cruelty.The revelation is Sudeikis who initially delivers his standard, unimpressive, nice guy schtick- a performance he is very good at, it's just not hugely stand-out - but as the film, and Oscar, take a darker tone, Sudeikis subtly shifts gear, moving into menace and threat. It is an unstable performance, shifting suddenly and violently between nice guy and monster A man unhappy with his life, Oscar the bar owner is a thin veneer of respectability and decency wrapped around a cruel narcissistic bully. Sudeikis brilliantly shows the veneer cracking, splitting and revealing the monster that inhabits the man. It is a very impressive performance.The dark themes, twisted characters and bonkers premise was never going to be completed satisfactorily, and it isn't. The plot demands the mystery is resolved and the threat dealt with and the film does so, but not as neatly or imaginatively as you might hope. It proves impossible to reconcile the two parts of the story, monster in Seoul and monster in soul, in a way that serves both threads well. It is hard to root for Gloria as she finally steps up the the heroine role the monster in Seoul story thread demands, because we've seen she's really a bit of a hopeless selfish drunken stupid girl. Colossal is imaginative, flawed film blessed with exceptional performances from Stevens, Hathaway and especially Sudeikis. It is not a comedy, it is not a monster movie (though there are loads of loving homages in shots and music cues), it is not an indie redemption movie, it is all of those things together, and it is not a total success, but nor is it a total failure. It is a curiosity, and if you are cinematically curious, you should check it out.",Colossal

Sometimes you may have to pick it up and just throw it far away into the mountains. From the robot's perspective, it doesn't feel good to be thrown like that. But if you can be flexible enough to risk the fall then it is good to give that ride a go.It also talks about what alcohol does to people. How they regret what they have said and done while under its influence. And some men who wont regret anything at all.

As a writer and the director, he managed to make imaginations live and truly entertain crowds like me who often have a childhood imagination with robots and action figure,when we were kids, the day dream of boys with no physical boundaries what so ever to limit our fantasies.. Our thoughts was a living being on its own back then. And this man can make those childhood fantasy come true in Colossal. He knows what he is doing and have done it so good. The current special effects of the industry helped a lot in making ones dream a reality these days and age.

The casts are top notch, played so good into the whole essence of the movie. The casting director also deserves a thumbs up. The coloring and all cinema works were done so well too. I give it a nine.

It's not what you expect. At the beginning it plays with the tropes of the ""Big City girl that comes back to her small town and rediscovers the true values of the simple American life and find love with a good hearted local man"" - then there is the ""monster"" twist, and the twist that this is really not a rom-com. Very unique and original.",Colossal
165,steerpike_2002,"Compelling, original movie which is less than the sum of its parts",7,31 May 2017,"When I first saw the poster for ""Colossal"" I thought that it looked like a mid-90s family-friendly magic realism movie in the vein of ""Practical Magic"". When I learned the plot of the movie - down-and-out alcoholic learns that she is inadvertently controlling a giant monster attacking Seoul - and that Nacho Vigalondo, the director of the excellent ""Timecrimes"", was behind the helm, I knew I had to give it a watch.The movie is certainly many things. On the one hand, the realism plot-line with Anne Hathaway's Gloria moving back home and entangling herself with old acquaintance Oscar (played by Jason Sudeikis) takes itself very seriously and works very well as a story about the mistakes people make when they are struggling with addiction. On the other hand, we have the magic part with monsters in Seoul, which is arguably much more light-hearted (despite the indication of a heavy death-toll!). Do they work together? Just about, in my view.There will be some who argue that there isn't enough explanation tying these together, but I feel that Vigalondo is right not to fill the movie with dull exposition trying to make sense of what is, at heart, an absurd premise. Vigalondo spends much more time on the visual and spatial ties between the plot-lines, such as the use of the playground representing Seoul, a much more satisfying way to build credibility with the audience. Where it does fall short is in its symbolism. It felt to me that Vigalondo was attempting to represent Gloria's struggles with alcoholism through her interactions with the monster, but I never deduced a consistent code for how the relationships between the key characters translated between their realistic and magic forms. This was disappointing as without this, the film's purpose feels diminished to an interesting but ultimately frivolous story, all the more strange given its weighty subject matter.At times I got the impression that there were significant elements of the original story which were left on the cutting room floor, as there are one or two moments in the film relating to Oscar which seem important but are never developed further. I am left wondering whether some of the links that would allow the movie to form a more convincing whole will emerge in future cuts.Hathaway and Sudeikis play their parts very well. Some of their scenes could have come across as plain goofy if the audience was not invested in their characters but I never felt that they were in danger of this. I did think that Dan Stevens, of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""The Guest"" fame, was wasted as Gloria's ex-boyfriend, Tim.Overall, I did like ""Colossal"". It is undeniably original, but ultimately succeeded because it remained compelling throughout. I was invested in the outcome of the movie and the film was able to deliver surprisingly tense confrontations alongside its more light-hearted absurd moments. Had the film also managed to deliver a consistent symbolism to tie together its diverse elements it could have been a real triumph.",Colossal

 What I can never forgive though is messing up with the rules of the universe they created. For instance, how does Gloria manage to catch Oscar in the end, while she cannot see him? The whole story is fueled by ideas that won't patch up to make sense. I see what they were aiming at, but they didn't work hard enough to make it coherent. Or they thought people were dumb enough to settle for this. I know this is fantasy, but even in fairy tales you have to play by a set of rules and stick to it.

""Yeah we're friends again, just no more late night drinking"". Then Jason starts acting crazy again and blows up his bar and Anne stays by his side rather than leave. Then when Jason is about to go cause mayhem, rather than stopping him at the house, she runs over to the playground to battle him there, where they're jeopardizing thousands of lives. Why would she do that rather than trying to stop him before he got to the playground? And why was Jason's buddy, who clearly felt guilty about the whole thing, not trying to do anything to stop him? Anne's character keeps flipping back and forth between doing whatever Jason says and then attacking Jason to try and stop him.Nothing these people did made the slightest amount of sense.",Colossal
168,dune_3001,A great superhero origin story without being one,9,30 January 2018,"Colossal is a movie about people finding out they can control a giant monster and a giant robot in Seoul. It's also about making bad choices and trying to turn your life around, character growth, making amends and realizing everyone is not who they present themselves to the world. The lead actors are great in their respective roles. It was interesting to see Jason Sudeikis play against type; Anne Hathaway was also very good and pretty much carries the film.The movie is weird and jumps genres a lot. But that makes it great and unique. And also not for everyone. You either love it or hate it.A few logical gapes hold it back a little - for example how is Seoul not evacuated immediately and there are still people just casually chilling in malls and cafes at the exact times they know a robot may attack.

169,moofyieman,Controlling the monster.,8,12 August 2018,"This movie is a discovery. Sometimes there is such a movie that is not easy to digest and you must watch again or discuss with your friends. 
It started out like a simple rom com around the lovely Anne Hathaway and flat goofy character Jason Sudeikis. Jason is still living in the place where they both grew up and at first it seems like your normal girl gets back to her sleepy home town and falls in love etcetera.I must say I was losing a little bit of interest at that time but then the movie changed pace and it capativated me totally. Well done Nacho Vigalondo!
All characters grew in depth, Jason in particular. It is a movie about control actually. Control of yourself and others. Anne is out of control as her former boyfriend and herself say. She has no control over her alcohol use and behavior and Jason deals next to the same alcohol problem with serious anger and self issues. 
Such types as Jason has friends like the quiet and simple Austin Stowell and akward and always great playing Tim Blake Nelson with secrets all of his own.The bar he owns has a hidden back part which is not in use anymore and where he and his friends get drunk in. Anne opens this back part and all of this is of course a lovely metaphor for his life. There he changes drastically towards controlling everyone around him in a very abusing way. He is destroying the bar and himself with it. The swimmingpool scene with all those leaves is great by the way. 
Anne on the other hand is trying to take control back in her own hands and that control stuggle between all actors is very well done I think.People who just came for a comedy with monsters please go away. It is not about the monster in Korea, but in yourself. Everyone who understands and loves the underlying theme and character development, please watch movies with me!",Colossal

171,march306,Interesting variant of monster flick,7,18 May 2020,"What can this one be compared to?
It is not exactly a monster movie, like Jaws, The Meg, Godzilla, Piranha, The Host etc.
In fact, it more fits in the line of Anne's films, aside Serenity, Glamour Girls and Passengers, where she maybe tries to find uncommon scripts to push her image and acting towards new niches, which is Ok.
Serenity ist without question the more visual pleasant film, Passengers even more dark.
Colossal doesn't show characters that don't get what's going on over large portions of the action. It's a struggle between a kind of bully psychopath and a little girl, that wasn't solved then, and somehowgets revived later on, with monsters as a blown up manifestation of their malicious energy.
These monsters were not needed for the story itself, and maybe in other hands, another more symbolic or abstract manifestation would have done it.In contrast to Serenity, the story line and ending make much more sense. The twist factor is better than Passenger's. The effects/CGI are pretty good and the male bully develops convincingly.",Colossal

173,bottomsgaming,"Flawed, but Unique",6,2 December 2017,"Colossal is an interesting attempt at blending and subverting genres that on the surface appear to mix terribly. At once, it tries to be a rom-com, drama, thriller, with a pinch of monster movie for good measure. As bad (and interesting) as the idea might sound on paper, Nacho Vigalondo's film actually does a halfway decent job of pulling a competent flick out of the oven, even though it doesn't necessarily excel in any one area.Anne Hathaway plays Gloria, a woman who has to return to her hometown from New York city after a breakup. There, she reconnects with childhood friend Oscar, played by Jason Sudeikis, whom she has a cloudy history with. During this time, a gigantic monster begins terrorizing Seoul. Gloria quickly starts to believe (with fairly good reason) that she is connected to this monster, and as the movie goes on, we of course find out how and why. I always appreciate it when a director takes risks with a film. The first half-hour or so plays out like a rom-com (complete with hit- or-miss comedy) with a few allusions to the end product. Hathaway and Sudeikis are fine and comfortable in these roles, but don't really move the needle too much. This first half-hour is also how the trailers portrayed the film. I understand many people get upset when movies don't go exactly as advertised, but I welcome it. Drama, and eventually thriller, slowly start to creep forward as the comedy gets fewer and farther between. I'll avoid spoilers, but will say that Sudeikis impressed me when the performance needed to go a bit darker. We know that Anne Hathaway is good, and her performance here - even in the dramatic moments - is neither bad nor impressive, but par for the course. Sudeikis's character material here is fairly one-note, but he manages to pull the best and most interesting performance of the movie out of it. It's certainly not Oscar- caliber, but I found it to be a large step up from his average roles.The film is at its best when it briefly explores manipulation and abuse, and the effect it has on the people involved as well as the people around them. The movie doesn't fully commit to any themes or commentary here, which is fine, but I thought that these scenes came off particularly strong compared to the early comedic tones. The ending feels a bit rushed, in that it feels like the characters abandon any realistic logic remaining in order to get to the quickest possible conclusion. It's certainly not the worst instance of a character being motivated by the plot's needs more than their own, but it does stick out all the same.Overall, i feel like the movie was a worthy experiment. At the end, each facet of the film feels a little under-explored; the rom-com aspects were mediocre, the drama/thriller a little better but ultimately generic and underwhelming, the Kaiju aspect unique (for this sort of film) but tacked on. Despite all this, it does come together as a perfectly watchable film, with some interesting moments. I think it's at least worth checking out for fans of any of the touched-on genres.",Colossal
174,falbpe,"A modern fable about childhood traumas, alcohol and abuse",7,7 August 2017,"The bad reviews in this movie are not fair. Do not expect to find a Pacific Rim kind of action here. Colossal it is not a film about monsters or robots, not in a direct sense. It is more, a modern fable about childhood traumas, alcohol and abuse. It is not about monsters in Seoul, but about a monster in the Soul. We have a monster, the woman with a selfish behavior, and a robot, but this robot, is really the symbol of a guy without feelings, someone than lost one day the possibility of feel anything. It is a very tragic history, but in the context of a light comedy. The acting of Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis is very good; although their main characters do not act never like true drunken people; in the context of this movie, this seem fine. Because everything is in the end, symbolic. We can read a story of domestic violence, but at the same time, see two children that one day, suffered together a trauma. They return to the children playground where it all began, and here is when the monsters became real. But it is too, a tale about the indifference, and how very serious and disturbing things became normal when you are involved into a negative environment, in this case symbolized by the bar and the alcohol. I do not see flaws in this movie, but maybe try to be too much accessible, for a story with so dark background like this.",Colossal

Ten, fifteen and certainly twenty years ago, ""Colossal"" would have been a big hit in theaters. I am absolutely certain that this movie will eventually catch on and be at least a BIG cult hit.I think many who see ""Colossal"" will be very surprised. Not by Hathaway's performance. She is always a reliable actor but by the film itself. I am reluctant to call ""Colossal"" allegorical because that might scare away potential viewers but that is what it is at heart. It is also one of those films that can be enjoyed at one or multiple levels: you can enjoy it strictly as an action comedy film or as an action comedy with a an allegory about relationships, regret and yearning to be more than what you are. Or you could view it as a satire on action films. It's a lot of things but it's also intelligently and thoughtfully made. It amazes me that there are really only four main characters in the entire movie yet the great director Nacho Vigalondo makes the film feel fully populated. The main cast is excellent with Hathaway clearly outstanding but Jason Sudeikis is also really good. He's an actor who plays a character so well that you feel it is part of him. In the end, it's Nacho Vigalondo's direction that makes the tricky material work.

Be warned: any film that is described as 'quirky' is usually devoid of plot and merely a vehicle for intellectual masturbation. This film is very 'quirky'. First off, it never really starts: we waited for about an hour (and a short snooze for me) for something tangible to happen. It didn't. Note to the producers: something has to happen. If it doesn't, people will walk out (we did).Second note to the producers: someone needs to tell Anne Hathaway she can't act. OK, I'll do it: ""Anne, you can't act"". Anne Hathaway was four months pregnant when this was filmed - and she looks pregnant. Third note to the producers: Don't cast someone who is obviously pregnant as somebody who is not pregnant (people will wonder why she waddles).A movie's first hurdle is to entertain - if it fails to entertain it fails. This fails.The characters were uniformly unpleasant: there's no-one you care about.

197,smanteufel,"Not a Colossal waste of time, but not great either",6,2 July 2017,"In what could playfully be argued as indie cinemas answer to Pacific Rim, Nacho Vigalondo's most recent picture seems to have divided many over whether or not this film even means anything. I for one am a proponent of the film feeling that it represents real characters with real problems; whether that be Dan Steven's character (Tim) being a right ass, Austin Stowell's character (Joel) being a massive coward, or of course Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis's characters Gloria and Oscar respectively, struggling with alcohol; something I found particularly relatable or so my friends keep telling me (I don't see the problem). In any case, I found this character driven narrative to be both full of whimsy and validity, even if the explanation for the events that occur in the film are thinly veiled at best, it was Hathaway's exceptional performance that certainly helped me to look past this pretty rubbish story. Perhaps the most succinct way to explain this films narrative is that it is allegorical of our inner demons. The two main characters struggle with multiple psychological issues that at the beginning of the film seem at most, slightly embarrassing, with side effects including Gloria being unable to hold down a job, or fighting with her boyfriend, etc. But events later on in the film reveal that her drunken behaviour impacts more than just her own life, but is in fact killing hundreds in Seoul and yes, the metaphor is slightly over the top if you ask me, but its message is as clear as this movie is stupid, and that is, how our own personal problems can hurt others unbeknownst to us. All things considered, this isn't a bad film to wind down your week on a Sunday night, with Anne Hathaway delivering one of her better acting performances, more akin to her part in The Devil Wears Prada than more serious outings like Le Mis, but ultimately this film feels forgettable and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone other than the most die-hard of Hathaway or Sudeikis fans.",Colossal

The movie investigates the kinetic world, about the things we cannot explain. What would you do if you had abilities above the known? Surrender or try to change the outcome? Well. Take a journey into your own personality and see where it takes you. This movie somehow touches the things we have to do to set things right. Sometimes those decisions are not the easiest to make. What if, what you do, here and now, has an outcome somewhere else? What would it take for you to take those steps to find out? Well. This is a light sci-fi, set right here on Earth. It is a light film and I don't think it's scary, so it works for the allowed age groups just fine. It's a nice entertainment film, perfect for a night home.",Colossal

It's a pretty grim tale about a dysfunctional alcoholic woman and her controlling/abusive relationships with a little bit of sci-fi premise sprinkled on and no discernible comedy.
I guess whoever writes the blurbs for Netflix doesn't actually watch the films.
If you're looking to watch a train wreck of a woman be controlled and abused by men, with a bit of monster stuff, then have at it. If you're actually looking to watch a sci-fi comedy I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",Colossal
201,andrew-marks59,Surprisingly funny and ever so original! This was a colossal good time!,8,26 January 2017,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one when I sat down in my seat at the screening. I heard a couple things about it but I still wasn't hyped for the movie. To be honest, I thought it would just be another disappointing science fiction indie movie to add to the list, but I was wrong. The cast was great, amazing performances from Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, and Tim Blake Nelson. It might seem like an action packed sci fi film based on the premise, but it was more a story of this woman (Anne Hathaway) and her going back to her hometown realizing she is in some way related to the actions of a giant monster ravaging its way through Seoul, South Korea.The movie did have some refreshingly funny bits that took me by surprise as I thought this was more along the lines of the Godzilla remake from 2014 in tone. Speaking of Godzilla, this movie is definitely paying homage to him and other classic movie monsters. I don't want to give too many details away but I will touch on something that bothered me in this movie. Violence against women that seemed way out of place and took me out of the movie for a little bit. Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) hits Gloria (Anne Hathaway) multiple times in one particular scene towards the end, it was added to show that he was evil but it seemed like overkill to me. Something that redeemed the movie was that she did get revenge on him in a way rewarding to the audience.My Suggestion: See it! There is nothing quite like it and trust me, you'll have a great time watching it just as I did.Seen at TIFF 2016.",Colossal
202,mql21,Not a Kaiju film,7,3 May 2019,"The film has two interpretations, a literal and a metaphoric one. Sticking only to the literal reading is a mistake since the film loses all of its sense.The relationship between Oscar and Gloria represents this sort of toxic relationships where women are sick and want to leave but men won't allow it. That's literally what happens when Gloria wants to leave but Oscar tries to intimidate and threat her. Basically, if she leaves, he'll hurt people from Seoul. The film is a portrait of that kind of relationships where violence reigns at night and then it's all apologies and presents to make peace in the morning. At one point of the film, Oscar brings some furniture as an apology for the argument they had the previous night, which is a clear representation of that toxic behavior.The ending, represents the liberation of a woman who manages to finally leave the psychological abuser behind. Colossal is an excuse, in the noble sense of the word, to expose Vigalondo's feminist vision of life and human relationships.Nacho Vigalondo, as a joke, referred to the film as a new version of Godzilla and people took it too seriously, he even got sued for it.

The movie is a true parable and shows that the true ""monsters"" of our world aren't 100-foot-tall giants, but instead the deeply disturbed and sadistic individuals that walk among us who we may naively call 'friend', 'family' or 'love'. In the everyday, the events and steps of people's journeys through life are the gigantic-in-the-small-in-the-gigantic and this movie showcases that in a way I never thought possible.The script and execution were absolutely perfect summations with pinpoint accuracy as to the nature of true psychological and emotional pain, domestic abuse and personal morality. Anne Hathaway's character is messed up, sure, but she possesses moral integrity and heart that let her see the error of her ways, which is far more than can be said for the everyday, normalised, controlling and abject evil carried out by Jason Sudeikis' character. The movie is just fantastic and I can't state that enough. Please give it a chance.",Colossal

206,marco-grix,Charmingly offbeat,9,9 June 2017,"Quirky story with few plot holes, a well-portrayed main character, and non-silly humour. Having always been on the fence about Anne Hathaway, this movie definitely had a convertive effect on me. From the distance that is typical of real life, most would consider Gloria a failure -- but the intimacy of the movie experience reveals that she fails with so much charm. Hathaway's demeanor and facial expressions are priceless, so many chuckles in the first third/half, before things darken. I'd never noticed Jason Sudeikis before, he portrays eerie Oscar well. The rest of the cast is kinda meh, but never mind. Main complaint: The movements of a human do not directly translate into the movements of a colossus, the laws of physics rule that out.

211,aguilera1685,Not what I was expecting,8,8 November 2019,"Like many here, I expected something different than what was delivered. In this case, I was glad. Instead of a one-dimensional romantic comedy with a funky twist, I got a multi-dimensional, deep piece full of allegory and symbolism. I get not everyone will appreciate or understand it, but for those capable of connecting with a film on a level deeper than its superficial story or those who have dealt directly with these themes in their real lives, it's rewarding.As a child from a home of alcoholism, manipulation, and domestic abuse, I immediately recognized these themes. At the playground when Jason Sudekis' character threatens Anne's character that it'll be her fault if he hurts people because she leaves I was taken back to my father making the same type of threat. Destroying the bar? I'm taken back to when my dad would do something destructive as a means of using it as a pawn to manipulate immediately after. Anne's character has her problems with drinking and being a general mess, but the differing types of abuse at the hands of the men in her life aren't so obvious. It's refreshing for her to finally come to grips with her demons, see she's hurting people and make the decision to change; and again when she musters the strength to remove herself from the toxic relationships she's in.Yes, there are some points where it's a bit disjointed, and points where it doesn't seem to make sense, like when Jason pivots from someone seemingly nice to a complete monster - but that is EXACTLY how alcoholism and using people goes sometimes. People change at the drop of a hat. You're frustrated AF when that one friend doesn't seem to do anything and just stands by? That's exactly how it is with some friends when you're in an abusive relationship, they feel like their hands are tied but they can't bring themselves to act at the same time. Things that may seem out of place have an explanation somehow.Perfect? No. But way better than some give it credit for if you're willing to look deeper. Can't wait to give it another go!

Dont let this prevent you from watching it and is a very good, original movie that is likely to become a cult classic in years to come much like Donnie Darko did.
The story is odd to explain, its about monsters destroying South Koera, but those monsters are actually the 2 main characters in America through some kind of weird connection. 
That is only a small part to the actual film though as it mainly focuses on the relationships of our characters.
Its not a comedy but is amusing in points, the acting is superb from Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis, i particular think Jasons role as a controlling/over possessive boss/boyfriend i the stand out performance and probably his best to date, unfortunately will be missed by the awards due to the low key of the film.

I had some free time, so I decided to give it a watch.Unfortunately the Japanese title of the film made the premise almost too obvious, unlike the original title which was vaguely big, but small at the same time.Still, I didn't know what to expect.At first I thought it was a Korean movie. Then a Korean kaiju movie. Then suddenly it was an American soap drama. The first portion of the film sort of sent me all sorts of places, but it did kinda make me interested in seeing more.The film had big ideas. Huge ideas. Massive ideas... Okay I'll stop...Unfortunately, while it was interesting, the story had a lot of holes. The big question was eventually answered, which cleared out the head of the movie. But there was just so many small, a lot of small details that was missing.Granted, I don't always expect films to spoonfeed me all the details. Like some films can be very subtle with it's plot and messages, where the viewer has to have a keen eye to discover such details. However, even if this film was made to be like that; it's not that kind of movie. There was no real overarching message or purpose to the plot. Just a bunch of big ideas sewn together. Despite that I still enjoyed the film. It was a good watch.The main problem that I noticed was that the characters had no... purpose? There was hardly any development. They characters were, relatively, in a way, quite well made? The main and supporting cast had clear characters. And they all had personal issues within the film. But none of it is really looked into. The film shows all these small details about the characters, of which none are actually resolved or even answered. But due to the ''bigger'' problem, this seemed like a minor missing detail while actually watching the film. But there were indeed some points where you just question ''...but why?''.Some of the questions were answered in the end...? I think...? However, they didn't go further into the answer, which just created another question formed from the answer. Which left me scratching my head, because it just kinda glossed over what seemed like a pivotal point for the characters and the plot. It was these small, but unassumingly big points missing from the film, which made it look like a big puzzle with missing pieces. You can still see the overall image, but you are missing a lot of minute details.Despite all of this; I still enjoyed the film.

229,jms-915,A delightfully weird mixture of genres,8,22 May 2017,"Indie hit Colossal is a weird movie. It is all at once a monster movie, a romantic comedy, and a story of alcoholism. And for the most part, it pulls it off.Anne Hathaway plays an unemployed alcoholic who moves back to her childhood home after breaking up with her boyfriend. Upon arriving, a giant monster attacks Seoul, South Korea, and she gradually finds out that she is connected to this. Every time she sets foot onto a playground in her neighborhood, the monster appears and does whatever she does, on the other side of the world. Jason Sudeikis also stars as Hathaway's childhood friend.The monster is treated as a representation of Hathaway's problems. She is an alcoholic and spends a lot of time around men who treat her like dirt. This destructive behavior is shown as literally destructive, as the monster tramples the city.But the monster is rarely treated as the center of the movie. This is about Hathaway and her struggles. It is true that the monster is the driving force of the story, but very little of the rampages are shown. There may be points where it looks as if the movie is headed toward a big Pacific Rim style climax, but, to put it simply, it's not. But it is still an entertaining movie, nonetheless. Anne Hathaway's character is relate-able, and is played very well. The movie also has plenty of funny moments, even though it's rarely hilarious.I guess my main complaint with this movie would be Jason Sudeikis' character. I felt the motives for what many of the things he did in the second half of the movie were not very believable. The movie does not try to justify these actions, but it felt more like they were trying too hard to make him into the bad guy.Despite the weird concept, Colossal is a very entertaining comedy and monster movie.

This movie has amazing characters. They don't seem like heroes with super powers, but actual human beings dealing with real life issues and even pathetic enough for the audience to sympathize them. This movie is also amazing with its plot, far different from any other monster movies I've ever seen. Unlike a lot of monster movies these days, the story happens on the other side of the globe, in a quiet town. I'm not going to go deep into the story but I have to say, the story makes the audience feel trapped, and completely powerless regarding the development of the story.

In a world of super fast, wham!

What if you could control a monster? What would you do with it? You could take such a premise anywhere! Sadly, like the small minded characters in it, the film just runs in circles and goes no where. The trouble with the characters is that none of them are likable. Anne Hathaway pulls it off best with Gloria and at times is genuinely funny but alas she is working with poor material here and drunk Gloria is ultimately irritating. As for the rest. (ex)boyfriend Tim is dull, Joel is a one dimensional character who's only purpose is to get seduced by Gloria. Garth is good as the wacky character but given precious little to do. Oscar starts out nice but makes a sudden and bizarre transformation into evil Oscar half way through. The lines (and actions) they get to deliver are not only hackneyed but often lacking in any discernible reason.

The reviews are somehow mixed, but for me, it was a fresh air in the recent independent films, though a film with this stellar cast hardly could be called an independent one. It successfully binds real life topics, with magical realism and surprisingly succeeds in delivering an unforgettable synthesis, one which could be more beautifully felt, than strictly logically explained. The explanation is not hard to grasp, but the beauty of the concept as a film art piece is much more than the explanation of it. It is a poetic film with brilliant story structure and acting. The climax poetically reaches for and succeeds in evoking feelings which we all had, in times of great struggles, fighting with our demons and the demons of the others, which not always tend to destroy only themselves but reach towards our 'greener garden' as well. I recommend this film to every curious and creative soul out there.",Colossal

They tried to market this film as something far better than it really is. even though the original premise had some real potential, the awful character development (mainly Gloria and Oscar) managed to empty all that potential to a point that's almost nothing left.Gloria and Oscar are a pretty unlikable pair of human beings. They appear as hard-to- connect-with and with non-adequately presented trajectories, at least to the point one could really identify with and care about what happens or not to them, or merely understand more clearly why they are as they are.Gloria's character tries to gain some sympathy through the charisma of her actress, but instead of succeeding on this, she makes you think something like ""What's about this girl, anyway?""... And Oscar lacks a serious lot of depth, at least something to make more clearer why he starts to show from a certain point so many strange an widely incoherent attitudes with the character's own trajectory in the film until that point.What you see for a good part of the movie: two adult human beings with jerky attitudes (childish in most parts, in other just plain jerky) towards life, without knowing exactly why. That can be pretty annoying. Even with a (very, very, weak) explanation ahead in the story,it fails in stop the damage.What could be a far better movie ends as a cheap metaphor about the huge incapacity of a whole generation of adults in behave as well, clinging to an somewhat ridiculous immaturity. The final product, albeit well produced and with technical and direction in the right places, is something with a narrative depth as closer as a SNL sketch than a proper motion picture.In the end, it resumes itself as an whining generation movie of the sort ""I suffered bullying from a mean boy at school and now, 25 years after that, I'm a loser adult woman that cannot stand my life unless I drunk my sorry ass out in a daily basis.

My guess is that Hathaway's character, Gloria, is meant to be the protagonist, but in a weird sort of way, the movie demonstrates the reciprocal nature of abuse that Erin Pizzey noted when she opened the first shelter for abused women. Neither Gloria nor Oscar are good people, and there is no hero in this story, except maybe Gloria's ex-boyfriend, who tossed her out on her keister.

Slowly she starts to pick up on a connection between herself and a childhood friend. She also starts to see the toxic masculinity in the men she's around. It's a warning to both men and women of the damage that come from this behavior. How as women we don't want to see it, deny it, escape it thru alcohol and other self harm. (We become monsters)The violent acts by the male characters, aggression, overt sexual yet passive advances, even Anne participates in this until she can see it. There is stalking, and many other things, like inappropriate violence that you may recognize as symptoms of male traits gone terribly wrong. Luckily it all ends on a happy note, Anne reclaims her sight, realizes her own participation, and destroys the source of her dis empowerment.

This isn't a comedy, it's an abuse thriller with a couple possible jokes in it and a plot thinner than my patience for this movie. If you wanna hear the jokes then watch the trailer because every single joke is in the first act and once those things are gone the movie goes all ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" on ya and ceases to function. The makers of this film probably think that they are clever for this misdirection but it's not a misdirection, it's a complete change in genre. The worst part is even if I was expecting a dark movie all of its ""sinister"" beats fall flat and although Colossal may think itself as emotional and riveting in moments it just simply isn't. Colossal also tries to balance witty comedy, gritty real world elements, absurd ideas, and whimsical plot reasonings but in the end it topples on itself horrendously. Personally I have a relatively high-tolerance for dumb or passable movies but Colossal is neither; it's blissfully ignorant and inherently awful leaving me with an actual bad taste in my mouth that I washed out by watching some episodes of Parks and Rec.
So in the end, if you wanna a comedy; go watch something else. If you want a real-life drama; go watch something else. If you want a suspense thriller; go watch something else. Literally just don't watch this movie. It's luke-warm garbage and has no substance in the smallest of details.",Colossal

This can only be a sign of a total drought of quality in the film-making community at the moment, or maybe desperate festivals trying to stay relevant in the Netflix age? In truth, every character is two-dimensional, unpleasant and not engaging (utterly so). In trying to generate ""comedy"" the character- building is as deep as paper cut-outs, and later when the movie tries to turn into a ""thriller"" of some sort, it just crashes. Brutally. The ""action"" is stale and DEEPLY predictable and build-ups and resolutions are thrown in all over the place for no reason other than fleshing out a movie that is in reality just a single creative idea without any needful plot or story around it. Again, the only creative aspect of this whole thing is the basic premise itself. On the whole, completely forgettable (again, I suppose, except the core idea). For shame to make us suffer through almost 2 whole hours for an idea that maybe warranted a short episode of a TV-serial like ""The Twilight Zone"". I want my 2 hours back. Sorry.

256,iwakura-21901,"Watchable, but falling short",6,7 February 2019,"Giant monsters attacking Seoul, that sounds, at first glance, like the material B-movies are made of. Until you realize these monsters are actually a physical manifestation of 'the monster within', so to speak. Okay, you're willing to go there. However, the execution of this theme is rather flawed. When Gloria bumps into her old boyfriend Oscar, he seems quite likeable, and helps her out plenty. Then he suddenly becomes angry and bitter towards her: probably because Hathaway has just slept with his best friend, you think. Makes sense. That's where the movie starts tripping up on itself, though.There's a short flashback, with Oscar trampling on a maquette of sorts she made, when they were still children -- allegedly suggesting he had always been this spiteful, angry person. Not only does that clash with how we see him act initially, but, more importantly, because he has VERY good cause to be p*ssed-off with her, at that point. So, is he the jealous type then? The moment you're ready to go with that, Gloria herself debunks that, and spells out to him, that he's really just feeling the meaninglessness of his own existence, instead (with the veiled implication that this is why he wants to hurt people in Seoul). And yet, in reality, he's simply, overwhelmingly angry with her for having slept with his buddy, and really just IS the vindictive, jealous type.Okay, so Oscar's anger becomes manifest in a monster robot. But what about HER anger?! I mean, where does it come from? Because the flashback shows her getting angry at him getting angry, trashing her maquette? Huh? 'I got angry because you got angry' hardly makes for a fundamental 'monster within' theme, and is highly incidental, at best. I mean, his anger we can get easily; hers, however, is as good as absent. She's a complete mess, of course, but not the angry type.So, the movie wants to serve you an interesting, albeit unsual, theme, but fails to do so properly -- and on a rather fundamental level at that, really.Hathaway is brilliant, by the way.

In the end I felt like I just hate all the characters or at least I dislike them. I was expecting for an inner change, not just a heroic actions. The fight should've been connected with internal fight and life changing events. Taking the right path in life even after so many mistakes were done you finally realize that and you start working on yourself. But the heroic fight instead was just parallel to their lives and there was no change at all. She is an alcoholic selfish girl who can't decide what she wants from life, and ended like that, her ""boss"" was an envy dude who always hated where he stands and his status, and the ended in the same way. The quiet guy ended... as the quiet guy. The normal thinking boyfriend ended up as an attached boyfriend. Maybe that's the actual conclusion writers wanted to tell? I don't know. But seems like you don't end up with anything meaningful after watching it. Just entertainment.

264,TheFilmFanatic21,Colossaly Unmissable,8,20 May 2017,"It was Beauty killed the Beast.A recent surge in cinema has marked the return to popularity for the gargantuan movie monster. Godzilla has been rebooted by Monsters director Gareth Edwards, with Kong: Skull Island tying into the same movie universe full of massively unidentified terrestrial organism (MUTO) for short). Pacific Rim increases the love for film giants by including the massive mecha Jaegers to fight off the Kaiju threat, and the return and remake of the latest Power Rangers movie compounds the notion that our gigantic monsters are here to stay, blotting out the sun as they stride across the skyline.It is only expected at this point for the mockbusters to milk the popularity for all it's got, but they have been in the game for quite some time already, with more recent outings including Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark, which plays into the Kaiju versus Jaeger narrative, Big Ass Spider!, and Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus. The titles become more amusing with each new iteration, and it's safe to say that by this point, the mockbuster movie-makers know exactly what they are doing, playing into the same market that Roger Corman once and still does. Though this trend will no doubt continue its mutations, it is not unwelcoming for a film to play with the conventions and expectations of a popular genre, as Colossal cleverly does.Nacho Vigalondo returns after his first feature and native language horror Timecrimes and two segments in both horror anthologies The ABC's of Death and V/H/S: Viral, to name a few, so independent Canadian/Spanish black comedy Colossal comes as quite a surprising and welcome shock.Suffering alcoholism, Anne Hathaway's Gloria has destroyed her writing career and lost her lecturing British boyfriend to her errant behaviour and addiction. Although alcohol abuse is a prevalent theme throughout, the reasons for Gloria's dependence is never touched upon, and it doesn't need to be. Circumstances are not the point, here. It is the effect and not the cause Colossal is most concerned with.Darkly comic laughs are to be had as Hathaway and her gang of go-nowheres learn that she is somehow connected to a reptilian Kaiju that terrorizes Seoul at oddly specific times and evaporates thereafter. Hathaway puts in a great performance of the lovable alcoholic, never indulging too much in the exaggerated swaying and slurring audiences have come to expect from representations of the drunkard. Her jovial demeanor, in fact, gladly pulls the film back when it takes a sharp turn and touches up darker themes of physical and emotional violence, control and blackmail.Jason Sudeikis lends to Hathaway's performance, with a character arc that to's and fro's in such a way that is considerably confusing until some revelations about his character arrive towards the conclusion of the film. This alternation is a tad confusing on first viewing, we as an audience don't know whether we should love, detest, or pity until we ascertain what causes his unlikable disposition. The reason, however, is suitable and befitting of the independent black comedy label, and in retrospect the varying nature of Sudeikis as Oscar is imperative to the film.This brings the second theme of the film, alongside alcoholism, to the fore. Insignificance and feelings of being small rears its monstrous head also, contradicting the nature of the gigantic monster movie genre. Personal, metaphorical monsters are embodied by literal massive monsters, giving the Kaiju and Jaeger reason to exist outside of the more modern destruction-porn. Colossal thus plays with what we view as conventional to a genre, maturely and playfully adjusting our expectations of the monster movie.All monster-feet-indented roads lead to a satisfying bittersweet climax and an enjoyably ambiguous ending. With striking imagery, a soundtrack that screams independent and a clearly conscious choice to display the literal monsters as briefly as possible to let the personal inner-monsters and human drama breathe, Nacho Vigalondo's film shatters the mold set by our Kongs, Godzillas and Big Ass Spiders in a delightfully low-key fashion.strikingly unique and offering a surprising roller-coaster-ride of emotion, Colossal stands tall in playful yet dramatic defiance of the massive monster genre that seems to have once again found its rather large footing.7.5/10",Colossal

284,sunny-susi,"Uneven, clunky, and disappointing, despite great performances and an enjoyable first half",4,5 May 2017,"I enjoyed the first half quite a bit. In the first half you get to know Gloria, and though she's flawed and irresponsible, I found her charming and entertaining. Seeing Gloria's flaws and quirks was engaging and funny. She's a rather self absorbed insecure mess, but she is unapologetically herself. Her fumbled attempts to figure things out are engaging because she feels like a real person who makes mistakes and yet keeps going on undaunted. But then things get crazy. I thought the premise of Gloria being connected to a monster in Seoul was ridiculous. Gloria, a woman with a messy life in a small town in America thinks she's important and powerful enough to be a monster with catastrophic potential and then it turns out she's right. I think it's pretty insane and problematic that Gloria's self absorbed self aggrandizing notion turns out to be right. It's almost like the movie is promoting the self absorbed egocentric tendencies that are part of today's society. Then once Gloria discovers her connection to the monster, Oscar abruptly turns into an evil controlling asshole. I was totally thrown when he went from small town nice guy to jealous controlling maniac. There was no nuance to Oscar once he was revealed to be evil. Suddenly he starts to emotionally and physically abuse Gloria, he destroys his bar by setting off fireworks, he's revealed to be a creepy stalker who shows up at Gloria's, and he's an asshole to his friends. Oh, and he's hoarder (I find it problematic that there's an apparent connection made between a mental illness like hoarding and Oscar's unhinged controlling violent ways). He's just too one dimensionally evil to be believable or engaging. But my biggest issue with this movie is how it handles gender. This film is supposed to be a feminist movie, but I don't agree that it is. The film problematically present violence as female agency. Gloria never stands up or confronts the problematic way that Tim and Oscar treat her except with violence and self deprecation. At one point she agrees with Oscar that he should feel ashamed of his actions, but she never calls him out for anything specific. And the way she handles Tim's asshole behavior is just as halfhearted. All she does is not show up where she is supposed to meet him and then she says that she is really out of control (once she's in Seoul) so Tim can't handle her. By saying she is out of control she is basically saying that she is the reason that her and Tim's relationship can't work out, not the real reason which is that Tim is a condescending emotionally abusive jerk. And the only way she stands up to Oscar is by assaulting him. When she is the monster and she slaps Oscar the robot the film the glorifies this violence by women against men. What's up with the difference in the way violence from each of the genders is depicted? When she slaps and then punches Oscar it's triumphant and deserved but once it's the other way around the camera lingers on Gloria being hurt. Why is it okay that she hits Oscar but it's not okay that Oscar hits her? Gloria is totally helpless once Oscar violently hits her and she just passively lies on the ground once he's beat her up. The only way she can truly stand up to him is by becoming a super powerful monster. The film seems to be suggesting that women (as they are) are too weak to stand up to men and that the only recourse for women is extreme violence and even murder (aided by some outside source, in this case super monster powers, but in real life maybe some kind of weapon) to stop the men from abusing them. The only good avenue for resisting an abusive relationship is to run away as she does with Tim or to incapacitate or kill the abuser as she does with Oscar. To me both of these methods are passive and problematic. Gloria just makes the problems go away somehow, she never confronts the men about why their behavior is not okay. I don't know. I'm a feminist so I tend to be overly sensitive to problematic gender dynamics, so maybe I'm reading too much into Gloria's methods of resistance. My main point is that I don't think violence is a good way, and not even an acceptable way, to resist an abusive relationship as it seems to be in the movie.",Colossal

I'm not saying it was entirely bad, just to warn people that you probably won't get what you expected.—CONTAINS SPOILERS —I decided to watch this movie because I love Anne Hathaway and especially Jason Sudeikis, I love all of his comedies and I was expecting to find that funny character here, too. The fact that this movie really made me, not only despise him, but be actually afraid of him was a big letdown for me. By the middle of the movie I was really tense because Sudeikis's character really triggered a fear response on me. That being said, the acting is really great, since that was what was expected from the character, I just wasn't prepared for that. Hathaway is really great in the movie, too. I thought the story had lots of plot holes and many characters went from one personality to another really quickly and without explanation and I didn't quite understand the origin of the monsters, I saw what happened but I thought it was a weak reason to start it all.I did really love the idea of the ""nice guy"" brought by Sudeikis's character and that part was well-written and an interesting plot twist for me.I don't think this movie was bad, (I didn't think it was good, though) but I can say that I watched it with a completely different idea in mind and that really affected my general perception of it, so I'd give it 5.5/10.",Colossal

Finally he is sick of it and dumps her. But later on in the story his personality complete changes which makes no sense and makes him look desperate and needy.She moves back home where she apparently owns a giant house and has money lying around to buy her a new bed and also untold amount of alcohol despite having no job in the last year.She meets an old school buddy, he comes off as a nice guy at first and helps her out. He tells her about his mother and she doesn't remember that she died despite attending her funeral. He gives her a job because he obviously wants to sleep with her.They are both chronic alcoholics and she often blanks out.She f**ks some random guy that plays no actual relevance to the story later on and just disappears.There is a half crazy guy that is high on cocaine the entire movie and they play him off to be some sort of wise man at first.She kills hundreds of people and complains about the 'bad guy that she later on kills' for having a bit of fun despite not hurting anyone. Then she physically assaults him multiple times until he finally snaps.She later on tackles him to the ground, killing hundreds more.He suddenly turns from nice guy into a mass murdering psychopath who blows up his own restaurant that he spent his entire fortune and life renovating over some girl he has only know for a week after not seeing her for 20 some odd years.The story line, characters and dialogue were terrible but the actors were superb and so was the CGI for a low budget film such as this so I can't give it all bad reviews.I can deal with a few logic plot holes here and there, but the characters personalities completely ruined the movie for me and made it unenjoyable.Some people will absolutely love this movie, but not me...

The story is seen through a woman's journey of redemption from all that she was trying to escape from. The Movie is clouded but symbolistically through a Kaiju element that brings the story together. A realization to ones own of what needs to be done to begin to heal and be free to who they are...a way to get away from what they have been numbing themself from in the movie. It's a social commentary that needs to be addressed today in society. The Writer, Director and Cast were magnificent with this movie. Very under rated for it's time.",Colossal
321,rdedoes,Strong message,10,8 May 2017,"***Spoiler if you have not seen it.*****I think the movie is a monster movie on a superficial level but there is a deeper social message. Domestic abuse and alcoholism. A person who has low self-worth often get trapped in abusive situations and sometimes uses alcohol as a means of escape. It becomes a situation where they bounce between abusive relationships. The alcoholism aspect of the movie also adds to the message. They end up hurting people accidentally. The people being attacked by a giant monster is there every day, even they know it happens every day, is the same as family and friends of a person who has a substance abuse problem. I felt the whole movie was metaphorical. I might be stating the obvious.",Colossal

I'm just here to warn everyone that the movie the trailer portrays is not the movie that I watched. It was made out to be a quirky comedy, or at least that's the impression I got from the previews. The movie I saw was a dark flick about jealousy, abuse and alcoholism.I'll leave it at that. it wasn't a bad movie, just not at all what was portrayed in the trailer.

323,sergiopoe-161-934280,How much are we supposed to suspend disbelief?,6,21 May 2017,"I get that for movies based on superhero franchises or fantasies, we're supposed to suspend disbelief for some aspects at least. But this was supposed to be a monster movie (I guess), plain and simple. How do we go from that to Sudeikis's character basically threatening to kill thousands of people if Hathaway's character moves away? Does that sound like rational behavior? Are we really supposed to believe that one person would kill thousands of people without giving it a second thought? And for what, just to keep a love interest from moving away? I suppose some will find in that a great philosophical question into the nature of humanity, but not me. I found it thoroughly unbelievable.Also, the ""explanation"" for how that playground came to have its magical powers seems unnecessary. It's not like any explanation is going to be satisfactory. I sincerely doubt anyone said, after watching that scene, ""So that's why they can conjure monsters in Seoul. It all makes sense now!!"" I suppose it didn't suck a lot, but certainly don't go into this with super-high expectations, like I did after reading some glowing reviews.",Colossal
324,imdbjcb,"Not a monster film, but a clever one about control, jealousy & domestic violence",8,23 May 2017,"I hope that the title/summary I have used doesn't give too much away but it is important that you know what you are letting yourself in for when you see this light-hearted and quirky film, especially given some of the misleading reviews on here.This is not a monster movie or a sci-fi one, despite what the one-star reviewers will have you think (they didn't get it). It is a film about a woman who initially settles for men who are not her equal (spot the three types of sub-standard boyfriend material). Stuck in a relationship with a jealous boyf, Gloria ends up in the company of someone she grew up with and suffers again like she did twenty five years ago. As a good feminist movie we also see her having a fling with some eye-candy but only when she realises that she is better than all three of them does she sort out her life (and strike back – literally).The partying and drinking are simply reflections of the low self-esteem she has developed (don't read anything more into it; she's not flawed) and the monster (barely on-screen) is just a metaphor. (Clearly they don't teach people about metaphors anymore ... it's just a device, people!) While only one female actor is in the film it strikes a blow for equality and against controlling male partners. It does this in a clever and funny way; I'm sure that it will become a cult movie.You'll be sorely disappointed if you are after Godzilla, are unreconstructed and think women are property to be controlled or have little in the way of life experience. If you have a brain and some empathy then you will enjoy it, whether male or female. (I was reminded just how much there is to make me feel ashamed of my half of the population – those with the Y chromosome – there isn't a male role in the film to admire.)",Colossal

Like a person giving a $15K economy car a terrible review since it is not as nice as a $200K exotic car... Well, Duh?? That makes no sense and is a waste of everyone's time. If you hate most movies that much, why bother watching and reviewing? If you want to be a jerk like Simon Cowell I guess that is your choice. Just because you can be horribly negative does not make your review any more valid or special!Anyway, this was a pretty good movie. It actually had a decent story with good acting and a little CGI which was done very very well. Some Sci Fi movies are just all action and CGI whizzing around... Eye candy movies I call them. This movie had just enough fantastical parts to get my interest. This would have been a typical Twilight Zone episode back in the day. If you have a short attention span like my GF who can't stay awake through any movie unless she is playing candy crush on her phone, this movie is not for you.. If you have no imagination, this movie is not for you.. I'd say a 6.8 rating is very fair for this film.

The plot was bad and without spoiling much the whole ""backstory"" for why the events were happening were beyond stupid. Please don't waste your time with this, I wish I hadn't.

I just wasn't expecting to watch Hathaway's character be an alcoholic hitting rock bottom when she finds herself having to move back into her childhood home, now totally void of parents or furniture. She meets a childhood friend? bully? (Sudukis) hard to decipher history ,who also seems to have hit bottom heavy into alcohol as well. Anne's character and his seem to be fighting their inner demons through these Godzilla type monsters that fittingly appear on other side of world in Seoul Korea...interesting play on words here as the location seems to symbolize the destruction they do to their actual SOULS through these monsters in the city . Abuse escalates emotionally and physically with Hathaway up until the end fighting to escape an increasingly abusive Sudukis( FYI he does not play his usual comedic role so don't expect it, extremely dark) . ***Warning- this movie could definitely trigger a person suffering from emotional trauma from abusive relationships *** Not a terrible movie- just very heavy- maybe too heavy depending on what mood you are in.",Colossal

Ann Hathaway vs.. or something, a giant monster or just monster in general maybe perhaps?""
so i decided to track down a copy and watch it. i did not bother looking at trailers because most of what i have seen Ann in i have greatly enjoyed or generally liked.the opening was somewhat slow yet interesting, however the big reveal came without even the slightest recognition for the hinted big reveal. the writers or the directors made a bad move when they decided to have Ann's character experience blackouts and memory issues early on in the plot and then never really re visit them except when her nice guy friend would show up at her empty home with a van full of free furniture for her for previously un-revealed reasons. this leads the audience to think that they will eventually have a budding romance and ultimately end up together.
this of course gets flushed right down the toilet when Ann's character randomly decides to sleep with the seemingly mindless line less side character whos entire character lead me to think that he was not a person at all but instead a plot device used to serve as a means to an end which was ultimately her childhood friends 180 degree character trait reversal. i was right. beacuse it was obvious to me that all of her problems that arose from her friend discovering that he too holds the same secret power as her and decides to be evil with it, was entirely the result of her decision to betray his good/ romantic intentions and advances by deciding to take a ride on plot device boys disco stick, completely out of the blue.
had she not done this we could have had a much more interesting story but no we instead got some lazy writing, because you cant have giant monsters or giant robots without having them fight or cause general havoc for the sake of big flashy explosions and generalized stupidity.
in the end the ""sudden bad guy for no reason"" was revealed to simply be nothing more than an extremely jealous man child with deep seated issues revolving around personal betrayal.worth the price of the popcorn? yeah sure.
worth the price of buying it? yes because even if it was bad the actors and crew and everyone involved still deserves to get paid for their work especially the art department and the guys that rendered the monsters, which looked like they could have been in pacific rim. solid mad props to those guys, very well done.do i think it is a must have movie? if you are a die hard giant monster movie fan then sure, go for it. if not; then see if you have a friend you can borrow it from or rent/ stream it somewhere. for all its flaws it is still a good movie. not great, not oscar material, but still; good for a rainy evening in.",Colossal

The Acting in this movie is believable, at least on a standard ""movie acting"" level. The scenes where the characters are drunk don't always work, which is a shame, because those scenes are important to the movie. A lot of the problems people have with it are based on them not noticing that a lot of the changes one certain character goes through are obvious, especially after rewatching the movie, where you can see it clearly and them just not enjoying the movie, which is fair. It's not a movie, that everyone will enjoy. I enjoyed it for the characters, that start as your predictable protagonists, but end up having something, not new, but still refreshing enough to feel new when you watch it. I loved all the scenes with the creatures. Some metaphors and symbolism are obvious, if you paid attention and I really don't want to be this guy who, in defense of a movie, just says ""people didn't understand it"", but a lot of people seemed to miss important parts of the story, while I was reading some of the reviews, all I could think of was ""did they even watch this movie?"". I watched this movie twice and I liked both times.

350,dkurtz-56925,An Elevator Pitch Worth Thinking About,7,28 April 2020,"It is conceivable Nacho Vigalondo pitched this movie with the line, ""Imagine Godzilla, not as an angry lizard, but as the embodied rage of a little girl who destroys Seoul from the safety of a quaint little town."" Regardless of its execution, this idea has much potential.The sci-fi genre is unique in that it is always straddling two worlds. The first, is the obvious world of a radically distinct aesthetic operating on some strange properties, set in some far distant galaxy or some near envisioned future. The second world is the present context of the audience. With every strange principle and every misshapen alien, there are points of contact where the audience can find an opportunity to relate.In as much as Colossal fits within the sci-fi genre, it has setup a strange world that seems uncannily like our own. It has established a weird and inventive property of a world that can both strike one's own imagination and yet have incredible application for explaining the world we all live in.Somehow when Gloria and Oscar stomp, fight, or dance in a park in the United States, their exact actions are relayed to giant monsters in Seoul South Korea mimicking their every move and thus causing all kinds of confusion and destruction. While odd, in a fun sort of way, this property of Gloria and Oscar's world finds creative application to our own world.The film clearly draws a connection between the Monster of Seoul and the Demon in one's Soul, and yet it can go further. The monster conceit can poke our intuitions to judge the merits of certain moral acts. How closely can we rank self-inflicted abuse by alcohol with murder of innocent people? Both might be the cause of a disordered soul. We too can ask questions of our desensitized look towards calamity in the world. How often can monster-sized news appear more as entertainment than a call for sympathy and action?Other reviews do well in critiquing Colossal as a bit confused in its execution. The metaphors were unclear and the characters were poorly developed. The beauty of this film is that it introduces a novel idea that finds a handful of unique ways to potentially speak to our world. The interest of the movie can be boiled down to an elevator pitch, but such a novel idea is a rare find in movies and is thus a good movie.",Colossal
