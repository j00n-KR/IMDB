0,Leofwine_draca,It's pitiful,3,6 April 2016,"This 2013 CARRIE is actually the third adaptation of Stephen King's first published novel. I'd missed the previous and long forgotten version, but the De Palma original has long been a favourite of mine due to the exemplary direction which helps to lift it above the source material.Inevitably, this cookie cutter remake is entirely redundant and feels like weak sauce compared to the 1970s film. In some places the remake plays out shot-for-shot, while at other times the story has been needlessly updated to the modern age, i.e. the characters have smart phones. The only thing it has going for it is that it puts bits of the novel back in that De Palma took out, but he took them out for a reason and I think his film is the better for it. However, if you're looking for cheap CGI effects, which the original certainly did not have, then you might prefer this version.And how half-hearted this all feels. Chloe Grace Moretz has long been overrated as the 'next big thing', famous only for her roles in the KICK ASS movies and failing to prove her worth elsewhere. She's a victim of miscasting in this one, failing to do much with the role and feeling over the top in her mannerisms. The less said about Julianne Moore, who gives a weak imitation of Piper Laurie for her part, the better. The worst thing about this as a whole though is Kimberly Pierce's direction. It's insipid, making crucial set-pieces look silly (the whole repeating of the falling bucket makes this feel like one of Jackie Chan's death-defying stunts), and it comes as no surprise that as a director she has zero experience in the genre.",Carrie
1,SnoopyStyle,Chloë Grace Moretz not right for role,6,29 April 2014,"Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a shy introvert who was forced into regular high school after her mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) had always home schooled her. She's been brutalized over the years and was almost killed by her mother during her home birth. She has telekinetic powers that she slowly tries to master. When she has her first period, she is bullied by the all the girls. Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) posts video of the incident. Popular girl Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) regrets her part and tries to make up for it.Chloë tries so very hard to be that shy damaged girl that was played so well by Sissy Spacek in that iconic performance. She's doing what I call near-cry-acting. She is always on the verge of crying as she force herself to look down like a shy teen. It doesn't really fit her. IMO she would make a much better Sue. Although I understand the big star always gets the big title role. She just doesn't fit Carrie that well. Sissy Spacek has that fragile look that Chloë is missing. The only way she could play Carrie is if director Kimberly Peirce allow her to go much darker. I wonder what would happen if Carrie goes to the dark side.The addition of bigger effects and CGI is interesting but not always good. I like some of the action in the gym. The multiple dumping of the blood is unnecessary. The head through the windshield needs to be much better. Quite frankly, I wouldn't mind if the movie expanded the prom scenes even more.",Carrie
2,Prismark10,Carrie on,4,30 October 2018,This remake of Carrie lacks Brian de Palma's distinctive visual style. It also adds little that is new to the 1976 original.Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) has been raised by her over zealot religious mother Margaret (Julianne Moore.) She is socially awkward and has little idea how her body works such as menstruation.At high school the shy and reserved Carrie faces bullying when she has her first period. Carrie also realises that she has telekinetic powers and tries to harness her powers.One of the high school girl's wants to make amends for her bullying by getting her boyfriend to take Carrie out to the school prom. Another bully though plans to take revenge.Moretz lacks the awkwardness and weirdness of Sissy Spacek.,Carrie
3,claudio_carvalho,"Unnecessary, but not Bad Remake",6,16 January 2014,"The outcast teenager Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) is bullied by her mates at high-school. Her mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) is a pious and paranoid woman that sees sin everywhere and the need of self- inflict punishment. When Carrie has her first period, she does not understand what is happening to her and her mates humiliate her in the changing room. The spiteful Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) videotapes Carrie with her cell phone and posts in Internet. Their teacher Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) punishes the students and Chris challenges her and is suspended and consequently she can not go to the prom. Meanwhile Carrie discovers that she has telekinesis and leans how to control her ability. The popular Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) feels bad with her attitude towards Carrie and asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to invite Carrie to go with him to the prom to make up for what she did to Carrie. But Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) plot an evil prank with her friends to seek vengeance for Carrie with tragic consequences. ""Carrie"" is an unnecessary remake of the 1976 classic directed by Brian De Palma. Sissy Spacek is unforgettable in the role of Carrie, but Chloë Grace Moretz does not disappoint. The dramatic story of Carrie and her relationship with her insane mother is engaging especially because of Julianne Moore, who is one of my favorite actresses. The conclusion uses state of art special effects and it will satisfy the younger generations. In the end, I have to eat my words and agree that ""Carrie"" is not a bad remake. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Carrie, a Estranha"" (""Carrie, the Weird"")",Carrie
4,nogodnomasters,IT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE AND BETTER,5,3 September 2018,"If you have seen the original Carrie, this remake will bore you to tears. Sure, they added cyber bullying to the film, big deal. The acting was great, but so was the original. Did the ""Plug it up"" scene surprise anybody? Did anybody not know what was going to happen with the pig's blood? The fire? the automobile? the mom? And what about the ending? I recall watching the original Carrie in the theater. That surprise ending literally had people jumping out of their chairs. This one put me to sleep. It was like watching a film where someone told you everything that was going to happen.Why did they even bother?",Carrie
5,kosmasp,Tweaking,7,13 June 2014,"Some might remember this for it's viral marketing (putting a woman with powers into a café as a teaser to this was almost geniuses) or for the fact that it tried to recreate a classic horror movie. Whatever your point is or was coming into this, you will see a very solid horror movie that updated a classic and took it into the current time. There are themes explored here, that weren't touched upon in the original, which is a smooth move.Other than that Moretz delivers one strong lead performance. If you know the original or have read the description you will know where this is heading. It won't spoil too much or take too much away from it though, because it is well directed. It might be too neat in places, but overall this does have punches and it's not afraid to deliver them. Overall not as good as the classic, but way better than one could expect it to be",Carrie
6,gavin6942,A Fair Adaptation,7,27 October 2014,"A reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother (Julianne Moore), who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.This film is criticized pretty harshly by audiences, especially horror fans. And for the most part, these criticisms are unfair. One minor problem with the film is the use of CGI when it was not necessary. And the major problem was remaking a classic. As it is impossible to improve on a classic, any attempt will be met with strong resistance.But there are many strengths. First and foremost, Chloe Moretz, who is easily the best actress of her generation. Horror fans are lucky she has worked extensively in the genre, because her roles have brought much strength to otherwise average films. While perhaps not as awkward as Sissy Spacek, she handles the role well.There are some aspects that are closer to the novel, including the more violent and intense climax, and the pregnancy subplot. This version has a more sympathetic Sue and Tommy as well as a more self-confident Carrie. These are different takes on characters that make an important, nuanced difference and allows for different interpretations. The updating of technology adds a different angle, too. This is its own movie in many respects.Is the original better? Of course. It is a classic and directed by the legendary Brian DePalma. It probably should not have been tampered with (although it has been before). But if it had to be done, the people involved could have done much worse than this.",Carrie
7,jboothmillard,Carrie,5,15 December 2013,"The original 1976 Brian De Palma version starring Sissy Spacek and young John Travolta was of course the first Stephen King novel to become a film, and when I saw that they were remaking it with the young star of Kick-Ass I was definitely up for it, from director Kimberley Peirce (Boys Don't Cry). Basically deeply religious Margaret White (Julianne Moore) gives birth to a baby daughter, she initially intends to kill the child, but cannot bring herself to do it, so years later her daughter Carrie (Chloë Grace Moretz) has grown to be a shy, under confident teenager, nearing graduation graduation from Ewen High School in Maine. While showering she does not realising she is having her period for the first time and assumes she is dying, the other girls tease and laugh at her, bully Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) films it on her phone and uploads it to YouTube, and supportive teacher Miss Desjardin (Judy Greer) sends her home, but the girl fears her mother Margaret, with her deluded religious beliefs of sex and other ""sins"". All the girls who bullied Carrie are forced by Miss Desjardin to endure physical education boot camp style as detention punishment, and anyone that refuses will be suspended from school and lose their right to attend the prom, Chris is the only one to refuse and storm off, but she vows revenge on Carrie. Meanwhile Carrie is learning that she has powers, she researches in books from the library and finds out that she has the ability of telekinesis, where she can move things with her mind, and Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) feels guilty for joining in the teasing, so wants to make amends, asking her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to invite Carrie to prom with him. Carrie eventually accepts Tommy's invitation, and Margaret forbidding her from going forces her to use her powers to lock her in the closet until she returns home, and once at the prom the young girl is shy and nervous to do almost anything, Tommy is nice and kind while they dance and share a kiss. But Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan (Alex Russell) have planned revenge on Carrie, they have fixed the ballot vote to crown the prom king and queen for Carrie and Tommy to win, and earlier they gutted a pig and drained its blood, and a bucket of the blood hangs above the stage ready to dumped on Carrie. Sue, being texted by taunting Chris, rushes to stop something happening, Carrie and Tommy do indeed win and are crowned, the blood is dumped, the bucket kills Tommy hitting his head, and to add to the humiliation, the video of her bleeding in the shower rooms is shown on the large screens, and all in the audience are laughing. This is when Carrie goes insane with rage, and uses her telekinetic powers to wreak havoc, killing many of the students and teachers, fire and destruction in his path, Chris and Billy try to drive away but Carrie stops them, and trying to run her down she flips the car into a gas station, the car explodes killing them both, and Carrie simply walks slowly home. After washing the blood off in the bath, Margaret has broken out of the closet, she comforts her daughter, but then curses keeping her as a child, and stabs her in the back with a knife, so she defends herself with her powers, stabbing her with various sharp tools until she is dead, and feeling hysterical she makes it rain stones, crushing the house. In the end, Sue comes to talk to her, Carrie stops from killing her sensing that she is pregnant, and Sue watches as the house collapses and apparently kills the Whites, and some time later Sue visits the grave of Carrie, the headstone spray painted with the words ""Carrie White Burns in Hell!"", and after placing a single white rose and walking away, the headstone breaks in a force of Carrie's anger. Also starring Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen, The Terminal's Barry Shabaka Henley as Principal Morton, Zoë Belkin as Tina, Samantha Weinstein as Heather, Karissa Strain as Nicki and Katie Strain as Lizzy. Moretz is a very talented actress, you can't deny that, she is not as delicate or vulnerable and of course powerful as Spacek was, but she does alright, same with Moore, she is not sadistic, deranged and evil as Piper Laurie was, but also does alright. It is good that all the scenes that made the original film great remain, i.e. the menstruation with bullying, the killing of the pig, the spilling of the pig's blood and the over the top massacre finale, obviously being a modern update there are the odd additions which help make it a little different, this is nowhere near the outstanding quality of the original, but is an alright horror film. Worth watching!",Carrie
8,Tweekums,"A decent enough, if unnecessary, horror remake",7,13 September 2020,"Carrie White is somewhat a loner; raised by a fanatical mother who believes just about everything is sinful and bullied at school. She hasn't been told about what it means to become a woman so when she has her first period, in the shower after gym class, she is terrified. The other girls mock her and one, Christine ""Chris"" Hargensen, even films her on a phone. This lead to Chris being suspended and being banned from attending the upcoming prom; she determines to have her revenge on Carrie. As well as becoming a woman Carrie starts to develop telekinetic powers. Another girl, feeling guilty, asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom... when Chris puts her revenge into action Carrie's powers erupt in a deadly way.The original 1976 film is rightly considered a horror classic; even those who have never seen it, or read the book, are likely to know what happens at Carrie's prom... which slightly lessens the impact of the scene in this film. Trying to judge this film on its own is difficult but I'll try. It starts well with the characters being introduced and developed and no real violence before the infamous prom scene. Chloë Grace Moretz is the right age for the role and her acting is impressive; unfortunately she doesn't feel as vulnerable as Sissy Spacek did in the original. Julianne Moore is suitably disturbing as Carrie's overbearing mother and the rest of the cast are solid enough. The special effects are pretty good and there are some impressive shocks. Overall I don't think this remake was needed but it turned out better than I expected... certainly worth the 50p I paid for the DVD.",Carrie

10,BA_Harrison,Carrie On Regardless.,4,25 August 2014,"Raised by a domineering, bible-bashing mother Margaret (Julianne Moore), teenager Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) has grown up introverted, insecure and socially awkward, and the victim of bullying by her high-school peers; but after Carrie gets her first period, she discovers that she possesses supernatural powers that enable her to turn the tables on her tormentors.Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to cast Chloe Grace Moretz, one of the hottest young actresses of today (both in terms of looks and Hollywood status), as socially awkward, emotionally troubled telekinetic teen Carrie White? This remake was destined to fail as soon as that decision was made. It doesn't matter how lank they try to make her hair, what drab clothes they dress her in, or how much she hunches her shoulders, Moretz is simply way too attractive to play the part of Stephen King's tragic, reclusive outcast.Moore, looking weary and worn, is much better suited to her role of Carrie's overbearing religious nut of a mother, but still fails to bring anything new to the part so memorably played by Piper Laurie in Brian DePalma's excellent original. Ultimately, Carrie '13 is just one more ill-advised, instantly forgettable, and unnecessary Hollywood remake: almost identical to DePalma's classic in terms of structure and dialogue, but with little of that film's class or style.",Carrie
11,paul_haakonsen,"Good movie, but a very unnecessary re-make...",6,5 January 2014,"As nice as this movie is, I can't help sit here and think that this movie was utterly unnecessary. If you have seen the 1976 classic, then you might as well just skip this movie - unless you are fan of anyone on the cast list or want to see the special effects here.Now, fair is fair, and I will say that this movie is actually a nice enough re-shooting of ""Classic"", but hardly a movie that the Hollywood movie industry would have suffered horribly from, had the movie not been made. It is one of those times when movie makers should just leave the classics be and do other projects instead.Anyone familiar with horror movies should be familiar with 1976 classic, and if not, well then this 2013 and re-filming would be a good introduction to Stephen King's story - although, I think a book should be read at any time compared to just sitting down and watching a movie.The story, short and simple, is about Carrie White (played by Chloë Grace Moretz) who is ridiculed and bullied at school, because she is socially awkward and seen as an outsider. Having an overly zealous religious nutcase for a mother (played by Julianne Moore) doesn't help Carrie along with self-confidence either. Carrie slowly comes to learn that she is gifted with the gift (or curse?) of telekinesis. When asked to the prom by one of the popular boys, things seem too good to be true.This 2013 version is nicely made, and have some really nice acting talents on the cast list. And Chloë Grace Moretz really does a great job in portraying Carrie.If you have seen the 1976 movie, this 2013 version is fairly close to being a frame-by-frame duplicate of that classic. And as such, this movie wasn't really a necessary movie to come out of Hollywood. But for a newer audience, this up-to-date modernized version should be a blast.Good movie, good effects, good acting, but doesn't beat the original, not by a long shot.",Carrie
12,Coventry,"After the blood, come the boys. And the mass-murders!",6,19 April 2018,"I notice that I've become a lot more tolerant and open-minded regarding remakes of genuine horror classics! 10-15 years ago, around the time when remakes of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Fog"" were getting released, I was fanatically against the trend and even encouraged others to boycott all these titles. My perception gradually changed over the years. Of course I still think that Brian DePalma's original ""Carrie"" is a powerful genre landmark and that another remake is completely unnecessary, but if that's what it takes to attract new & younger audiences, then so be it. I even daresay the 2013 version is fairly enjoyable, mostly thanks to a very solid & plausible performance by Julianne Moore and a surprisingly big amount of bloody murders and explicit make-up effects. This 2013 remake is almost identical to the 1976 original, except that the script is updated with typical post-Millennium atrocities. When poor Carrie White hysterically panicked for getting her very first menstruation at school in 1976, she got laughed at and bullied by the other girls in the shower. In 2013, she gets laughed at and simultaneously filmed by a dozen of smartphones, so that afterwards she gets cyber-bullied yet again on the internet. As I said, ""Carrie"" is a reasonably good film and I'm trying to be mostly positive, but there are nevertheless a few unforgivable mistakes here. First and foremost, the casting of Chloë Grace-Moretz. She certainly isn't a bad actress, but she's far too attractive and trendy to depict the unique titular character. Regardless of what pitiable clothing she wears or how pale her skin looks, this natural born cute girl simply cannot pass for the timid, introvert and religiously oppressed ugly duckling Carrie White! I know I'm sounding like a dinosaur again, but Sissy Spacek was phenomenally well-cast in the original for her looks and charisma, whereas here it's the other way around. Secondly, and this perhaps largely the achievement of Sissy Spacek also, the 1976 Carrie somehow remained a ""human"" and a ""victim"" when she went on her murdering rampage after the pig-blood incident at the prom. 2013 Carrie seemingly transforms into a sort of mean and unstoppable killer-robot, devoid of any emotion whatsoever. But hey, Julianne Moore's performance is truly impressive and arguably even more better than the almighty Piper Laurie in DePalma's original. Her depiction of the insanely religious Margaret White is intense, disturbing and genuinely petrifying. Other strong points include Kimberly Peirce's surefooted direction and the bloody carnage Carrie leaves behind at her senior prom.",Carrie
13,michaelRokeefe,Horror classic for a new generation.,7,16 April 2014,"Kimberly Peirce directs this remake of CARRIE, based on Stephen King's novel. Carrie White(Chloe Grace Moretz)does not fit in with her classmates. She is overly shy and seems innocent of the world around her. The blame for Carrie's introverted personality is her mother Martha(Julianne Moore), fervently religious and over protective. When Carrie has her first period in the gym shower, she is shocked and scared that she is dying; not understanding the bodily function, due to her mother's lack of informing her. Girls in the gym class begin taunting her, following the lead of Chris Hargensen(Portia Doubleday). Being bullied by what seems to be the entire school, the meek teen discovers that she has minor telekinetic powers. Sue Snell(Gabriella Wilde)wants to make amends for her actions and asks her boyfriend(Ansel Elgort)to invite Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts against her mother's wishes, not knowing that devilish Chris makes plans to humiliate her at the prom in front of the whole school. When the prank is carried out; the once meek Carrie White unleashes her new found supernatural powers creating total havoc. Revenge is bloody and hellish.This remake is not as shocking as the original, in spite of being modernized with newer style special effects. Miss Moretz is very believable as Carrie, but does not hold a candle to Sissy Spacek in the original. Moore is down right creepy and the one to really be afraid of. With the bloody violence, sexual content and disturbing images, CARRIE is not for all audiences. I would rate a strong R. Also in the cast: Judy Greer, Katie Strain, Barry Shabacka Henley and Samantha Weinstein.",Carrie
14,Theo Robertson,Brings Nothing New To The World Of Horror,6,28 April 2015,"Here's my review of the original movie ""CARRIE is based on the eponymous book by Stephen King and is brought to the big screen from Brian De Palma . It is arguably the highlight of both mens' careers which is a shame because it was King's debut novel and an early contribution to cinema from De Palma . Many people have gone in to the plot in great detail so I won't bother , but does anyone agree that the supernatural elements of the plot are the weakest parts ? Put it like this Carrie White is becoming a woman , is bullied and humiliated by her class mates and lives at home with an unbalanced religious theocratic mother . If you've not got a hell of a lot of sympathy for her you're probably a corpse . If you've ever vaguely had the problems Carrie is suffering from then you will find this movie very depressingThat's not to say CARRIE is a bad film , it's not but it's a very uncomfortable watch and much of this is to do with the cast . Spacek , Laurie , Allen , Katt and Travolta all play their parts with absolute conviction , a fact that is reflected in two of the cast being Oscar nominated and how often do people receive Oscar nominations for being in a horror movie ? Still it's best to bare in mind that this is a horror film because if it was a straight laced drama involving teenage angst on the battlefield of adolescence I would have probably have switched it off before the end credits due to the distressing narrative . But CARRIE is a horror film and a bloody good one which gets eight out of ten from me"" I thought I'd just include down to the fact that if people going to remake classic movies while not really bothering to improve things the least the IMDb fans can do is dedicate as less time as possible to reviewing the remake It seems entirely pointless to remake films like CARRIE . Stephen King adaptations were a mainstay of horror films in the 1980s then after Frank Darabont made three highly regarded films using King source material the brand name of King quickly disappeared almost as if he'd never existed and I doubt if King is a widely read author by anyone under 30 these days As it stands this merely a workman like film . Kimberly Pierce is no Brian DePalma . The casting is merely adequate at best though to be fair Julianne Moore is impressive as Carrie's mother and the equal to Piper Laurie from the original . Unfortunately this is perhaps the only true positive . Pierce tries a bit too hard at embellishing scenes especially the classic Prom scene which comes off faintly ridiculous the way it plays out here compared to the original which was shocking and remains one of the greatest scenes from horror cinema . On top of that I got the feeling all the nasty bits were left on the cutting room floor . I'm guessing that if you've never seen the original you might enjoy it where female teen angst meets supernatural horror but the original remains the better and one of the best horror films ever made",Carrie
15,preppy-3,Well-done but lacking,5,3 November 2013,"Redo of the 1978 Brian DePalma movie. Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a put upon teenage girl who is harassed daily and has no friends. She also has the power to move things with her mind. Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde) feels sorry for attacking Carrie when she gets her period and gets her boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to ask her to the prom. Carrie goes but evil Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) has a disgusting surprise in store for her...and Carrie gets MAD! This is a well-done movie. The acting is mostly good, it moves quickly and has great special effects...but why was it done? It adds nothing new to the story and lacks fire (no pun intended). Aside from the prom scene nothing here was done any differently than the original movie. You know exactly what's coming next so there's no suspense or surprises. Also another big disappointment is Julianne Moore. She's a wonderful actress but walks through her role here. She can't hold a candle to Piper Laurie who was incredible in the original. Same with Mortez. She's good but you won't forget Sissy Spacek. All the teenagers in this one are all in their 20s...and look it. They're all good-looking (especially Elgort) but seem too old for their roles. Moretz was 15 when she did this so at least she's the right age. The only really good thing about this was Carrie attacking at the prom. It's bloody and violent and kick starts the movie--but that's not till the very end. So, sadly, this is another pointless redo. It's so well-done that I hate to knock it.",Carrie

A Virtual Scene for Scene, Line for Line Redo that is Flat and Uninspiring.Chloe Grace Montez as Carrie, Her of the Voluptuous Lips, is a Cutie by all Accounts and has some Acting Chops to Boot, but is Woefully Wasted here. The Original Brian De Palma Film from 1976 has Style, Atmosphere, and a then Newness about it that Hit, Stuck, and is a B-Movie Masterpiece with Very Little Lacking.Watching this After Seeing the Original can do Nothing but bring on Anger and Contempt. Everyone and Everything is Wanting and this should Sincerely be Avoided. After Seeing the De Palma Version You can Skip this Unless a Comparison is Necessary, but be Advised it does Nothing New of Note.Creates Nothing, is Nothing, Except a Weak and Unnecessary, Deficient and Dreadful Retry that is Nothing but a Rip-Off.

17,utgard14,Another cash grab remake that sucks,4,8 February 2014,"Why great films get remade is beyond me. You shouldn't remake a movie that got it right the first time, especially if you have nothing new to add and are just going to copy the original for the sake of a quick buck. But there's no sense complaining about this as Hollywood has been doing it for decades and it will never stop. Anyway, I went into this with some degree of cautious anticipation. Why? Well I assumed director Kimberly Peirce would bring a fresh approach and update the original in a way that would validate this remake. So much has happened since the original film came out. School shootings, the internet and social media, and everybody and their uncle ""taking a stand"" against bullying. The film doesn't reflect any of this except for video of Carrie being abused in the locker room being uploaded online, which was dealt with unrealistically. Instead, this is essentially a direct copy of the original film with some overblown special effects and a much weaker cast. A lot was made of this cast being more age-appropriate than in the original, where the teen parts were played by actors in their 20s. But this cast is largely terrible and seems at home in any number of cheap slasher flicks we've seen time and again. The worst offender in the cast is the one I was most looking forward to -- the star, Chloe Moretz. A talented child star, Moretz's recent roles are convincing me she will have a limited career. Her performance here is weak, even without comparing her to Sissy Spacek's brilliant work in the original Carrie. The prom climax sees her giving an especially ridiculous turn, all wide-eyed with silly hand gestures. If I was supposed to feel anything other than second-hand embarrassment for her then she failed totally as an actress. The often overrated Julianne Moore is not much better. Yes, her character is clichéd and dated and should have been updated for the modern day. But still, Moore plays the role like a comic book super villain. Just absurd. Not shockingly, this is a poor remake of a great film. Do yourself a favor and see the original.",Carrie
18,grantss,"Not as good as the original, despite almost copying it shot-for-shot",5,3 January 2015,"Not as good as the original, despite almost copying it shot-for- shot.The original Carrie, released in 1976, is a horror classic. It was original for its time and one of the movies that made horror more main stream. Not only this, it launched the careers of Brian De Palma, Stephen King, Sissy Spacek, Amy Irving and John Travolta.This remake is incredibly faithful to the original, to the point that it is almost scene-for-the scene the same. It has been modernized - set in 2013 rather than 1976 - and there are a few minor modifications with the action scenes - but it does not veer too far from the original.What director Kimberley Pierce does not reproduce, however, is De Palma's slow-building intensity. Carrie 2013 feels incredibly flat. There is no mystery, no slow-burning tension. Furthermore, the nice character-building and scene-setting of the original is replaced by a token attempt at it. It all just seems rather dull.Of course, this could be just because I've seen the original so know exactly what is going to happen. That's what you get for being so faithful to the original...",Carrie

Yet another example of not letting a classic alone with a needless remake : Stephen King's horror novel adapted (again) with anemic results with Moretz as the bullied high school teen whose sudden onset of telekinetic powers is unleashed when provoked for far too long on her tormentors. Nearly a beat-by-beat/sequence-by-sequence echo of the Brian DePalma classic original the retread here even employs that film's scribe (Lawrence D. Cohen who collaborated with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa) barely adds anything worthy or new to the 21st century take on the thriller and filmmaker Kimberly Peirce seems to drag her heels in what seems like a quick paycheck with little effort (and no scares; criminal for the genre) and casting CW plastic rejects who barely register unlike Amy Irving and Nancy Allen as the good/bad girls in the titular heroine's class. Moore is no Piper Laurie in that she buoys her religious nut mother more on physical torture than psychological and while Moretz acquits herself, Sissy Spacek elicited far more sympathy. Rent (or better yet purchase) the original.",Carrie
20,neil-476,Julianne Moore justifies the remake,7,6 December 2013,"Teenager Carrie White, sheltered by her religious fanatic Mother, is tormented by other girls when her periods start and she doesn't know what is happening. They might have thought twice had they known about the telekinetic powers which puberty has brought her along with menstruation.Remakes are an interesting batch of movies to consider, particularly what they bring to the table. Often a remake will be a matter of bring something technically new - remaking black and white in colour, for instance - or else to emphasise different elements of the story, or an alternate artistic interpretation.Carrie 2013 brings little new. It abandons De Palma's showboating in the editing suite (for the better, as far as I'm concerned: I didn't care for all the split screen), and adds a few minor bits of plot and backstory. And the cast is different. Chloe Moretz' Carrie is a little more recognisably human than Sissy Spacek's rather other-worldly take on the character. This is good in the early stages, but less effective in the climax. Portia Doubleday's Chris Hargensen is every bit as odious as Nancy Allen. Judy Greer's Miss Desjardin makes a bit more impact than her predecessor, but the portrayals of Sue Snell and Tommy Ross are workmanlike but otherwise forgettable.The revelation here is Julianne's Moore's Margaret White, who I liked a great deal more than Piper Laurie in the original. She is every bit the religious monomaniac that Laurie was, but she wears a layer of sympathy which Laurie never did (neither did King's written version). You actually feel for Moore's Margaret, trying to do her twisted best for the daughter she loves, even though she is sprung from the Devil's work.When a remake is as similar as this is to the original - and there is nothing much wrong with the original - then the question must surely be ""Why did they bother?"" The answer here is Julianne Moore's performance.",Carrie
21,anaconda-40658,Chloe is Good but She's No Sissy.,6,15 December 2015,"Carrie (2013): Dir: Kimberly Peirce / Cast: Chloe Grace Moretz, Julianne Moore, Gabriella Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Judy Greer: Worthwhile although inferior remake to the awesome Brian De Palma original. Carrie White is the school outcast under the ruling of her religious fanatic mother. When hit with menstruation she believes she is bleeding to death and her classmates answer by pelting her with tampons. Carrie soon discovers that she has telekinesis, which means that she can move objects by force of the mind. Kimberly Peirce follows the De Palma version faithfully but the ending is a disappointment opting from a great final scare in the original. Another problem is that the remake seems somewhat reciting. Chloe Grace Moretz is terrific during the famous prom sequence where pig's blood is dumped over her head when she wins prom queen. One problem is that she is too attractive to be an ugly duckling while Sissy Spacek used her body language to convey her emotion. Julianne Moore steals scenes as Carrie's religious self mutilating overbearing mother who tries to kill her daughter. Gabriella Wilde plays the remorseful Sue Snell who convinces her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. Portia Doubleday is winning as bully Chris Hargensen who leads the hate against Carrie. Judy Greer as the gym teacher is weak because she seems as though she is reciting Betty Buckley as oppose to playing a part. This version is well made visually but the original remains a far superior horror film with its themes of bullying and religious repression that all streams out at the tip of that bucket of blood.

22,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and impressive remake,9,7 October 2016,"Adjusting to high school, a tormented teen who grew up in a sheltered religious home-life finds that her attempts at fitting it are thwarted by a prank committed by her tormentors at prom and uses her long-repressed telekinetic powers to strike back at them.This here was quite the fine if somewhat unnecessary remake of the story yet again. Due to the storyline parameters, what really works here is the amount of fun work featured here about documenting the tormenting and bullying that she undergoes in here, even with the repetition of the overly familiar themes present in here. Again this really brings out the insanely-religious upbringing causing this one to really set that foundation into what's going between them at their house that shows how behind-the-times and sheltered by the fanatical beliefs espoused upon her. Even though it all comes from a supposed place of love, the fact that it makes her so unprepared for life in high school and such an easy target for the pranks and humiliation dished out against her because of that status, these scenes are where it really shines with the still-traumatizing scene in the shower where she gets her period in front of the class. Slightly updated with the inclusion of the video being updated to the internet rather than just the teasing and tormenting, it gives this one a great tell for the plot line about her being tormented and the infusions of sympathy toward her generate the proper plot- threads in the story that this one hits, and it all leads nicely into the film's biggest set-piece at the prom which is what really turns this one into a great deal of fun. Complete with the proper set-up in the light-hearted beginning where they enjoy the prom and finally the big change-over with the prank that marks the start of the fun as the way she tears through the crowd in retaliation for what happened is quite the blast as there's a lot of rather new and impressive means in which she strikes back as there's whipping them through the air, throwing things into them and striking up great ways of setting them on fire or electrocuting them as the havoc caused here is so much fun and grand it really strikes a fine chord here. Complete with the well-deserved revenge and how that transpires here, these here are what really make this one enjoyable and more than a worthy remake. What really tends to hold this one back is the fact that it is a remake and tends to play around with the same set-ups and outcomes as what happened before so it becomes quite obvious this is a remake. It's not really taking any new chances with the material and really seems to be going through the motions of what happened in the original story which really gives this one a rather familiar feel for the most part. Likewise, the ending is a little overdone with the lame stalking scene in the house that doesn't really match the rest of the film and sticks out due to that, but otherwise this one had a lot to like.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Carrie
23,FlashCallahan,More dirty pillows......,5,3 December 2013,"Out of all the big horror remakes to be released this year, this is easily the most accessible one of the bunch, and the most watchable.But it's still a perfunctory remake, basically made for people who are too lazy to seek out De Palmas masterpiece, because it's too old..Carrie White is a girl who is ridiculed by her peers, forced by her mother to follow religion, and all in all has a really depressing existence. Feeling bad about what happened, one of the girls convinces her beau to take Carrie to the prom, with bloody consequences....What one doesn't realise is that Carrie is one of the most depressing, and saddest horror movies made. The girl is doomed from the beginning. Everyone dislikes her, of feels sorry for her, her existence, according to her mother is a mistake, and just as though she feels special, she gets humiliated, kills almost everyone, and then gets killed by her mother.Watch the movie again (the original), and think about that narrative point.The cast are good, Moretz will be a huge star, and Moore is fantastic as Mrs White, but honestly, there was no need for this movie to be remade. Its pointless, but it's not tragically bad, just catering for the teen masses.Of the all the incarnations of Carrie, this is the weakest, because it doesn't offer anything new, just a few flashy visuals, and less people getting killed at the prom.",Carrie

Unfortunately, this ill-conceived almost word for word remake is not only not as well-acted but also seems to think less of it's audience by 'dumbing' it down exponentially) I, for one, would just rather re-watch the marvelous original adaptation any day of the week rather than suffer through this forgettable tripe.

25,phd_travel,Enjoyable despite Chloe and Julianne being too beautiful,7,8 January 2014,"I had misgivings because the original Carrie was so perfectly cast. Who could be as strange looking as Sissy Spacek? Who could look as fanatical as Piper Laurie? Julianne Moore even made to look haggard was still too beautiful to be the crazy mother. After she did that silly Psycho remake how could she do this? And Chloe Moretz is just too pretty - she's more the hot girl in school than the freak. Even though she acts awkward and shy.But despite this, it turned out to be quite enjoyable because the story is such a good one and it's perennially entertaining. The main plot elements are quite faithfully followed except a couple of feel good changes which I think are for the better. The violence is slightly more graphic but still not too violent. And in the end having attractive leads makes a show easier to watch so Julianne and Chloe's good looks don't actually spoil the horror. The supporting cast are quite well cast - they look more like teenagers than John Travolta and Amy Irving did. Liked Judy Greer in the Betty Buckley teacher role.",Carrie
26,Wuchakk,"Chloë is effective, but the telekinesis is so amped up it's almost a parody",5,18 June 2017,"Released in 2013 and directed by Kimberly Peirce from Stephen King's novel, ""Carrie"" stars Chloë Grace Moretz as the titular teen misfit whose hyper-legalistic mother is mentally disturbed and abusive (Julianne Moore). A compassionate teacher (Judy Greer) and two teens (Gabriella Wilde & Ansel Elgort) try to help Carrie while her nemesis (Portia Doubleday) organizes a cruel prank for the prom, where all hell breaks loose.In ways, this is a competent remake and I generally prefer Chloë in the eponymous roll, who's surprisingly up to the task, although Spacek was more effective in the harrowing prom sequence. Unfortunately, this version is less realistic and feels like it's in a rush. The 1976 film took the low-key, slow-build approach and it made the prom scene so potent and iconic. In this remake the psychokinesis elements are so amped up they (1.) ruin the build-up and (2.) are sometimes so overdone I busted out laughing, like the crucifixion scene. A horror story like this takes skill to pull off with a straight face and the '76 version fully succeeded and is even a work of art whereas this rendering is less aesthetically pleasing and sometimes verges on being a parody. Also, other than Chloë, the '76 film has better women.However, there are some things in this remake that are well executed and even superior, like (1.) how it is emphasized that the abusive mother's interpretation of the bible is seriously askew, (2.) that Tommy boldly supports Carrie and clearly enjoyed taking her to the prom, (3.) that this Carrie (the girl) is a stronger person than the way Spacek's character was written in the original and (4.) the dramatic parts are generally more compelling.Final Word: While this rendition is worth checking out for the positives noted above, overall it pales in comparison to the original and the excellent 1999 sequel, ""The Rage: Carrie 2."" The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Ontario, Canada.GRADE: C",Carrie
27,trashgang,pointless remake,6,1 November 2013,"Halloween night 2013, a night to go to the movies to watch some previews of new horror flicks. After the wonderful remake this year of classics like Evil Dead and Maniac it was time for Carrie. The old one did had his scary moments but attending a lot of teens in the cinema I was already concerned and after watching Carrie I was right. This wasn't that good after all.What annoyed me the most were two things, first of all the faults in editing. You know the shots cation reaction. There were so many mistakes to see in the expression of faces that I even thought that Carrie was involved doing those things but I guess they didn't had enough time to edit because at the end the mother has knifes and scissors in her body which are being removed by Carrie but suddenly when picking up the body of the mother they are back. But there is more, when Carrie is being stabbed in the back she falls down the stairs and when laying on the ground there's no blood or stabbing sign on her back, next shot she's bleeding. And I can go on and on, Carrie in the shower appearing to be naked having her periods when laying in the floor you can easily spot her underwear. Not a good sign all those mistakes. Secondly at one moment it was more about the prom night in stead of Carrie herself. To be honest, it had a teenage feeling and was clearly made for twelve year old to enter this flick (which shows at the theater).Was it all that bad, not at all, the most important moments from the classic were in the remake, Carrie having her periods, Carrie at the proms with the blood and the attack of the mother with knifes and scissors. But for a horror it was rather lame. I did like the acting presence of Julianne Moore (Margaret White), but Chloe surely didn't look like Sissy Spacek, back the Carrie had some creepiness over her, here when Carrie is doing her supernatural stuff it looked like some wizard from The Hobbit. It didn't work out and it was even a bit exaggerated sometimes on parts she moves things and people. The only enjoyable part was with the car at the end, the way they got injured and done in slo-mo did work but overall it lacked a bit of horror. A pointless remake that I will forget rather quickly.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Carrie

I can understand that you want to make a remake if the first movie had a good plot but for some reason the movie sucked, but this was certainly not the case. So I don't really get the point of making this movie. The first one was for sure much better and more believable. Carrie with Sissy Spacek was perfect. They made her look like the unpopular outcast and that worked really good in the first movie. But here with Chloë Grace Moretz this doesn't work. She's better looking then the majority of the whole town. Julianne Moore as Margaret White, the mother of Carrie, on the other hand was believable in her role. I thought she did the best job in this remake. Well anyways, the movie was not bad but I preferred the original.

Same plot Carrie(good work from Chloe Grace Moretz) is a shy teen girl who's not in the click and she can not escape the hands of her overprotective bible freak mom(Julianne Moore). At school the in girl crowd of cheerleaders and sexy girls torment her(wow the shower scene with blood and soap, plus I liked the eye candy of seeing the sexy wicked girls wearing those sexy colored bras, it was a mix of pink, red, blue, and multi colored bras!).

31,KineticSeoul,Not really satisfying,5,26 October 2013,"Now I haven't read the Stephen King novel this movie is based on, or the first ""Carrie"" movie. But this one just seemed like it needed more development because the whole thing seemed a bit rushed. It's a very predictable movie, even if you don't know certain things about this flick before watching. It just seemed kind of forced at times, and when it's over it's just not really satisfying. Chloë Grace Moretz is a good actress and there is a bright future for her in this industry. But the part where she snaps didn't really do it, because her eyes are just too innocent looking even when she tries to act like she is angry. Which takes away from Carrie White's fury at the end. She is good playing the naive school girl. It seems today, people cheer for students that fight against bullies and stand their ground. But in this case it just lacked the development to make the climax more impactful. Mainly, because Carrie's psychotic mother is the main bully in this and it just seemed like Carrie took those scars and inner emotions and took it out on the other students. Since the only incidents that stood out was the tampon scene in the beginning and the pig blood spilling scene in the end. Personally, I just left the theater with this ""um okay..."" feeling, but nothing really satisfying.5.6/10",Carrie
32,OllieSuave-007,"Average acting, but an impressive prom scene.",7,31 October 2014,"Based on Stephen King's novel and a film remake of the 1976 original, Chloë Grace Moretz stars as Carrie, a shy high school girl who is a subject of humiliation by her peers, and suffers from abuse by her religiously-fanatic mother, Margaret White (Julianne Moore). Carrie later discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the edge on prom night by a humiliating prank, making her unleash untold powers onto those who tormented her.While Angela Bettis gave the Carrie character a fragile, vulnerable and timid personality in the 2002 TV version of the film, Chloe's portrayal was shy, but not as fragile, outcasted and vulnerable like her other Carrie counterparts. Her appearance seemed to fit in with the other girls more and does appear quite attractive in the movie, even before the prom. Portia Doubleday played mean girl Chris Hargensen, going over time to portray her as a foul-mouthed, spoiled and heartless human being. Alex Russell gave a rough-looking portrayal of Billy Nolan; Ansel Elgort gave a somewhat touching performance as Tommy Ross, sticking up for Carrie in multiple occasions; and Judy Greer gave a dramatic, yet somewhat witty performance as Miss Desjarden. Julianne Moore gave a pretty crazy and witchy-looking portrayal of Margaret White, almost mirroring Piper Laurie in the original.The characters didn't have as much interaction and/or connection with Carrie as the characters did in the 2002 TV remake. Carrie doesn't cross paths with Sue Snell and Chris Hargensen as much as she did in the TV version, only crossing paths mostly in the beginning scenes. Some of the acting, I thought, was a little wooden at times and didn't have enough emotion, particularly Carrie's vulnerability. However, Portia did do a pretty convincing job as being the leader of Carrie's tormentors and Gabriella Wilde's Sue Snell character did show a lot of remorse, guilt and sympathy towards Carrie.In addition, the prom scene is spectacularly chaotic and contained a lot more carnage than in the original 1976 film. I also thought Carrie's revenge on her tormentors were much more explicit, forceful and determined in this movie.Overall, it's an exciting horror story and not a bad remake of the 1976 original.Grade B-",Carrie
33,Hellmant,One of my favorites of King's and perhaps one of his most important.,9,23 October 2013,"'CARRIE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) For the second time in two months 16-year-old actress Chloe Grace Moretz plays a gifted but troubled high school outcast who takes revenge on her bully classmates. She last played this part in the comic book superhero film 'KICK-ASS 2' (as a young superhero trying to adapt to high school life) and now plays a similar role again (as a shy overly sheltered religious girl with telekinetic powers, trying to adapt to high school life). Julianne Moore co-stars (as her mentally ill domineering mother) in this reimagining of Stephen King's classic horror book. It was adapted for the screen this time by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (from Lawrence D. Cohen's original script and King's novel) and directed by Kimberly Peirce (who also helmed the critically acclaimed drama films 'BOYS DON'T CRY', which was also about a troubled outcast, and 'STOP-LOSS'). It doesn't have a lot new to offer but it's still an impressively made adaptation that rivals the original in film quality.The story once again centers on Carrie White (Moretz), a high school senior who's treated as an outcast by her peers due to her extremely religious and secluded upbringing. Moore plays her mother, Margaret, who believes she conceived her in sin and home-schooled her until the law would no longer allow it. Due to her sheltered upbringing she's bullied at school, especially when she has her first period and doesn't understand it. A popular schoolmate (Gabriella Wilde) takes pity on her, after first picking on her as well, and asks her jock boyfriend (Ansel Elgort) to take her to prom. At the same time another classmate (Portia Doubleday) is plotting her revenge on Carrie for causing her suspension from school and exclusion from the popular dance. While Carrie is dealing with people and new strong feelings and emotions she also develops telekinetic abilities, that become dangerously strong.The film is more faithful to the book than Brian De Palma's classic 1976 version but it still feels awfully familiar. That didn't stop me from enjoying the heck out of it though. I think Moretz is a really good and likable actress and the rest of the cast is more than adequate in the film as well (there isn't a bad or mediocre performance in the whole movie; they all shine in my opinion). Peirce's directing is excellent as well and although she's not nearly as stylistically cool as De Palma she does bring a little more realism and needed subtlety to the story. Her version is also not nearly as exploitative as the 76 film (which included a long and creepy high school girl shower scene). The story has of course been told before but it's one of my favorites of King's and perhaps one of his most important. The outcast tale is one that never gets old and I think it's always extremely helpful. It's just a grade A production all around and if you're a fan of the book (or the 1976 movie) you'll probably enjoy it as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llO-AVcYkfI",Carrie
34,thesar-2,Don't Carrie On,2,25 March 2014,"I am not exactly sure why Carrie needs so many remakes, reboots and sequels.As a huge (pre-sober) Stephen King fan, I appreciate his visions and horror. Granted, of all the dozen or so books of his I've read, his first, Carrie, I have not yet read. I know the whole story behind both the fiction and true story of it being written. In this particular case of fiction, the true story out-shines his book.(Google it for the entire Carrie background, or better – buy and read the fantastic ""In Writing"" by Stephen King.)I digressinto another story of mine: Back between 1992-1994 when I attended college, my film professor chose the 1976 film as ""the most influential horror movie of the 1970s."" Many, including myself, disagreed.Some would say it would've surely been the 1973 cult, The Exorcist. I would say: 1978's Halloween. But, I would concede that the Sissy Spacek version of Carrie was fantastic and haunting. Especially if the ending hadn't been spoiled by multiples of horror documentaries since.Fast forwardto last year. 2013's Carrie stars two established actresses. Well, one to get even better, I believe: Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. But, they could not pull it off.First off, there was zero reason to remake this again. Second, they not only didn't bring anything new to the table, they actually took the film a few steps back with terrible CGI and bad acting. And third, with most remakes/reboots, just stick with the original. This is no exception to that third rule.I would highly recommend the original and that alone. PLEASE don't let this be your first experience into the world of Carrie.* * * Final thoughts: I'm not joking. Read In Writing by Stephen King. Granted, there's other ways to get the whole story of the making of the novel, Carrie, but In Writing explains it best and from his own words. And speaking of which, in a wordTabitha. Thank you!!!",Carrie
35,Robert_duder,A good and worthy remake of the Carrie franchise,7,17 January 2014,"I had some huge expectations for this because I was killing to see it in theatres and didn't get to so I had to wait and wait and finally got the chance to see it. I love anything Stephen King and I also adore Chloe Grace Moretz so this was a surefire hit in my book and for the most part it was! I'm the last person to be anti-remake. In fact some of the best films of the last ten years have been remakes or reboots. Carrie wasn't brilliant and they dropped the ball in a few areas but they also succeeded in going a little deeper than the original film did, giving us more background on a key character (Carrie's Mom) and adding the necessary modern day twist to the whole story. There are one or two scenes that are nearly carbon copied from the original film but why not? That film is legendary and nearly forty years old so I don't see an issue with modernizing and updating it. The special effects are decent and the only main issue I had with the film is they crossed that very fine line and some of the film towards the end feels campy and outdated. Even the facial expressions on Carrie during her epic rampage (and it is very epic) were nearly laughable and that's unfortunate being the most serious part of the film.Chloe Grace Moretz is one of the best young actresses out there right now period. She is mesmerizing and this was an interesting role for her. She certainly plays the tortured soul with budding telepathic powers very well. She has instant charisma on screen and she is fun to watch in the terrifying role. Someone I can't stand...Julianne Moore. She is easily in my top three worst actresses list. Fortunately the entire purpose of playing Mrs. White (Carrie's mother) is for you to hate her. Even I can say she nails this role. She is downright creepy and disturbing and her chemistry with Moretz is very good. Gabriella Wilde is first of all gorgeous and second of all does a decent job playing Sue Snell, the popular girl who has a change of heart. Her role isn't amazing but she plays it well enough. Portia Doubleday is also decent as the evil mastermind behind the Prom day disaster. I wouldn't say she is as strong as she could be in the role but she definitely does well. Ansel Elgort is quite good as Sue's boyfriend whom she encourages to take Carrie to Prom. He has a small role but its quite effective. Judy Greer is excellent as the teacher who tries desperately to help Carrie. I would have in fact liked to have seen more of Greer's character as she is the best of the supporting cast. Alex Russell as Billy Nolan (the character originated by John Travolta) is extremely underused and underdeveloped. I can't even really say one way or another how good his performance was because it was such a small role.It was an interesting decision to have a woman, Kimberly Peirce, direct this film. Not only that but she really has no experience in this genre however she is a very talented film maker with critical hits like Boys Don't Cry and Stop-Loss under her belt. This is sort of her first foray into mainstream films and she does it well. Its a gritty, dark, disturbing story with elements of morality rolled into there. Religious fanaticism, mental health and bullying all play a major part in the story that is Carrie. I even felt like this particular rendition of the story had a lot of implied back story (Was Carrie possessed? Was another entity doing her bidding or was she truly telepathic?) I believe there is enough evidence to have those questions. Despite being a little cheesy at times (which is almost inevitable given the story) this is well worth a watch for horror fans or King fans because its a worth rendition not to be missed. It won't be on any one's top ten list but it certainly entertained me! 7.5/10",Carrie
36,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Another low grade remake that makes you appreciate just how great the original was,2,1 September 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCarrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a socially alienated teenage girl who lives with her religiously obsessive mother Margeret (Julianne Moore) and is the butt of all her cruel classmates jokes. But Carrie has the gift of telekinesis, the ability to move things simply by applying her mind. On prom night, after being pushed too far for the last time, she will use it to exact her revenge.If it's a rule of thumb that sequels, remakes and adaptations are the key films to avoid if you want to make a good film, then this remake of an adaptation was surely doomed from the start. Like many classic, cult films that have stood the test of time over the decades, Kimberley Pierce has decided to update the 1976 version of Stephen King's debut horror novel to modern times, and so we have Carrie's tampon ordeal at the beginning of the film captured on phone, and uploaded to YouTube. Other than this novel touch, the film is a painfully scene for scene carbon copy of the original, only squeamishly amateur where it should have just been, squeamish. Glancing at Grace Moretz's natural beauty and poise, she just fits in too well with all the other beautiful, mean girls, making you wonder why she stands out so much, unlike Sissy Spacek who captured Carrie's unglamourous fragility to a tee.The original has the uncanny ability to still make me jump at the end after all these years with the hand out the grave bit, so the flippant grave cracking at the end of this is just the final slap in the face of what has already been up to this point been an embarrassingly sanitised, bland, soulless attempt to make a classic original appeal to the Facebook generation. It may show it's age a bit now, but the original would still undoubtedly still provide a far more scary, psychological experience. *",Carrie
37,bowmanblue,Haven't I seen this somewhere before?,7,28 January 2015,"The 1976 version of 'Carrie' is undoubtedly a classic – the tale of a troubled teenage girl who gets bullied and exacts her revenge via her telekinetic superpowers. And here we have the remake. Or 're-envisioning' as the film-makers would prefer we referred to it as. Remakes (for that's what I call them) always have a difficult time. Either they're nothing like the original and no one can understand why they've been called a 'remake' (besides the producers trying to cash in on the title), or they're exactly the same (albeit updated) and therefore nothing new.Carrie (2013) falls into the latter. If you've seen the 1976 version you really don't need to watch this. It's basically the same film (i.e. same story, same 'scare scenes' and same characters), but with modern hairstyles and references to Youtube etc.As with the original, everyone in the remake plays their parts well. As with the original the scares are effective. And, as with the original, it's a pretty decent film – the reason being it's exactly the same.I loved the original, so I suppose that means I love this one, too. However, although I enjoyed watching Carrie again (I don't need to mention which one as both versions are the same!), I doubt I'll watch the remake again as I already own the original on DVD so I'll stick to that one.Yes, the special effects have been beefed up in the 2013 remake and they work well, plus some scenes have been 'fleshed-out' to give them a more modern spin, but, apart from that, there's nothing new brought to the table.If you haven't seen the original and don't want to watch a horror film where people sport big seventies haircuts then go straight to the new version. Plus fans of Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz should get more out of it than most.If nothing else... this film proves that you really shouldn't mess (or throw tampons) at 'Hit Girl!'",Carrie
38,g-bodyl,You Will Know Her Name!,8,24 December 2014,"Carrie is the remake of the 1976 Brian De Palma version which was a film adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Now I have not seen the first film, but I have read the book. This film is a modern adaptation that stays relatively true to the book. There are many persistent themes ranging from religion to social isolation to the millennia-old theme of good versus evil. The first three-quarters of the film is a slow, effective build-up which leads to the final quarter of the film in which all hell breaks lose as we see a rapidly-growing body count.Kimberly Peirce's film is about a girl named Carrie who is abused by her mother, a religious nutcase. Carrie also has a gift of telekinesis, which her mother sees as a sign from Satan. One day at school, Carrie suffers from a breakdown and she is tormented while in the shower with the gym teacher as her saving grace. However a prank is planned for prom and it goes wrong, very wrong indeed.The acting is very good.....and intense. Chloe Grace Moretz may of not been my first choice for Carrie, but she is decent enough. Much prettier than I would have anticipated. Julianne Moore was fantastic as Margaret, Carrie's mother. Judy Greer also delivers an excellent performance as the gym teacher who provides Carrie a friend in need. Finally, Ansel Engort and Gabriella Wilde play genuinely caring characters in Tommy and Sue who wants to help Carrie.Overall, Carrie is an effective horror film. I cannot compare it to the original as I have not seen the original. On its own merits, the film is really good and creepy. The first sections of the film is a little slow at times, but the final section makes up for it as things get really intense. The movie is more of a coming of age story, but it uses the horror elements to tell that story. This movie makes use of one good theme and that is do not bully others. The powers of Carrie are symbolic to her internal feelings that bullying created, and it's not a good thing. This film is creepy and a good film on its own. I rate this film 8/10.",Carrie
39,lesleyharris30,"Mediocre Horror with Massive Build Up to a Disappoting Outcome,",5,3 January 2015,"Carrie is a mediocre movie with a promising storyline that could have been done better and a talented cast that deserved more than this.My main problem with this movie is that it is very slow for the first hour and ten minutes,but there is a constant atmosphere that it is building up to something huge and terrifying,and once that scene we were waiting for finally comes,it is very uneventful,the last twenty minutes or so are brutally filmed and almost appear like stop motion was used to make these characters be blown away by Carrie's power.I have not seen the original Carrie so I can't compare them,but I'm sure I speak for fans of the first as well when I say Chloe Grace Moretz was not a good casting choice,she was fine while we were watching Carrie being a shy and awkward girl,but once Carrie unleashes her dark side that's when Moretz starts to fall flat,she is suppose to be scary in this scene but even covered in blood,I can't take the sweet girl from Hugo very seriously as an iconic horror character.Julianne Moore's performance was outstanding and without a doubt the best part of the movie,she really was able to deliver the dark,creepy personality that was intended for this character,she didn't seem any bit shy or awkward about doing certain scenes,she just completely became her character and this film could have benefited with more of her.Carrie is not as horrifying as it could have been and the majority of it is simply boring,and I think you would be better off avoiding it.A shy and very awkward girl,who is rejected by school mates and sheltered from the real world by her mother,unleashes her true demons at her prom night after she is pushed too far.

40,cosmo_tiger,9 out of 10 times the remakes are awful. This is the 10th one. One of the best remakes to come out in a long time. I really liked it,8,11 January 2014,"""Carrie had some sort of power but she was just like me, like any of you. She had hopes, she had fears, but we pushed her and you can only push someone so far before they break."" Carrie White (Moretz) is an awkward outcast at her school and a daughter of an overbearing mother (Moore) at home. Carrie also has a special power that she tries to keep hidden but you can only hide your true self for so long. I have been saying for a long long time now that Hollywood is out of ideas. If it's not a comic book movie then it seems remakes of TV shows and old movies are all that is being made. Going in to this I wasn't that excited because 9 out of 10 times the remakes are awful. This one is the 10th one. It has been awhile since I have seen the original but I really did end up enjoying this one. Moretz I think is a perfect choice for this role but Spacek did play it creepier. Also much like the original the mother is the creepiest part of this movie, mainly because she could really exist. Although I haven't seen the original in awhile from what I remember they didn't really change too much of it for this one. Depending on how you feel that is either a good thing or a bad thing. For me I'd prefer staying true to the original rather then changing something just to change it. That said I would also prefer an original movie over all of it. Overall, one of the best remakes to come out in a long time. I liked it more then I expected. I give this a B+.",Carrie
41,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,4,17 January 2014,"Carrie Getting your period is a magical time in a girl's life because it means she can be excused from gym class once a month.However, the menstruating student in this horror movie would prefer a permanent absence.Tormented by her peers (Portia Doubleday, Gabriella Wilde) after getting her first period, Carrie (Chloe Moretz) later discovers the crimson curse also unleashed her latent powers of telekinesis.Despite her mother's (Julianne Moore) misgivings, Carrie attends the prom with a boyfriend (Ansel Elgort) of one of her bullies.When her mother's warning turns out to be true, Carrie uses her twisted mind to massacre the student body.Despite sanguinary scenes at the end and contemporary special effects, this adaptation of the Stephen King novel is sluggish and superfluous when compared to the 1976 version.Thankfully, the only power women derive from menstruation is the ability to continue advancing their career unimpeded by children.

42,Bored_Dragon,Better than the previous,8,3 October 2016,"""Carrie"" from 1976 has cult status, maybe because it was a new thing at the time and a huge name like King was put on the big screen by famous De Palma... This one remains under the radar. Not so popular, low ratings on movie sites... It is a remake of the previous one, almost from scene to scene. So, it is not a new adaptation of the same book, but the new movie made using the exact same script used for the original. And I never heard of this director while De Palma is De Palma. Still, for me, a remake, even though there is no H from horror, is quite better. Although I may be biased because of Chloë Grace Moretz.8/10",Carrie
43,ironhorse_iv,"I feel like I been dumped by pig blood by this movie. It wasn't horrible. Still, It's just wasn't good. I would rather take the original Carrie to the prom.",6,27 October 2013,"This movie did light the fire in me, but not in a good way. The logic of remaking this film, besides money motivation was trying to re-imaging the classic horror tale into a modern high school settling, but in my opinion, it's doesn't do a lot of re-imaging. The film is nearly shot by shot the same plot line as the original 1976 Carrie. Yes, they made the film more modern, still, the film feels so fake with a bland good looking model like high school crowd, lame Tim Tebow jokes and cheesy highly ineffective CGI. It reminds me of that pointless shot-for-shot remake of 1998's 'Psycho' awhile back. I was really hoping for something truly new and scary. I thought the film would give more insight of the Stephen King's 1974's novel with the same name that would make Stephen King, a bit happy with a more faithful adaption. Even, Stephen King himself didn't like the Brian DE Palma's adaptation too much, but he did like the film. The movie could had an interesting epistolary structure, using new reels clippings, documentary style filmmaking, interviews, and excerpts from books to tell how Carrie destroyed the town of Chamberlain, Maine while exacting revenge on her bullying classmates similar to the way Stephen King wrote Carrie. Instead, the film make Carrie look like an X-Men character creating earthquake cracks or a freaking Jedi forcing people back or forth with her powers. While, her powers got stronger, it was badly use and the time could have been made to explain more of Carrie's dark psychology. I would have thought this movie would focus a lot more on the emotion impact of the bullying being directed by Kimberly Peirce who is known for her directing a realistic portrayed of Brandon Teena in the 1999's film 'Boys don't cry'. Instead of great psychology thriller with a lot of depth that should conjures ugly reminders of school shootings, we get a pretty safe movie. Even the religion fanaticism tones from the first movie get cut down and replace by over mothering to broader the Christian audiences to watch the film. The prayer closet got less scary. When, King heard about this new adaptation, he suggested Lindsay Lohan for the main role. I have to say, thank god, they chose somebody else, but I was really hoping for somebody better. I'm not saying Chloe Grace Moretz did a horrible job as Carrie White but she was miscast. The shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far. Still, Chloe doesn't seems like a person that would be treated as an outcast. The original Carrie, Actress Sissy Spacek, not only act the part, but look at the part, she was truly awkward in real life. I'm sorry, but Chloe is too beautiful to taken serious as Carrie. Chloe's open facial expressions were just awful as it kinda tired the film for me. She clearly unable to convey the unsettling awkwardness, reclusiveness, and eventual haunting necessary for deadly telekinetic killer. I would rather see Emily Browning, Juno Temple or Elizabeth Olsen in the role, as they seem somewhat creepy. Julianne Moore was pretty OK as Margaret White, Carrie's religionists fanaticism mother; but she's no way near the great performance from Pipie Laurie in the original movie. Gabriella Wilde as Carrie's schoolmate Sue Snell seem out of place, half the time, I was just wondering what school did the go to, modeling school. Also, Judy Greer played the gym teacher Miss Desjardin was a bit too young for the role and way too into the business of teenagers to the point, she punishing the bullies for a minor scene in the locker room in the opening, that she seem a bit too crude. Honestly, the girls in the original shower scene, treat Carrie way worse than this film. This movie makes the shower scene look like over bright foggy PG-13 film. It doesn't get violent, crude, until ¾ the film. It was weird that this movie was rating R. Honestly, you can tell that the original Carrie was rated R with the first few shots, not because of the nudity, but how the girls mistreat Carrie when she had her first period. In this, the girls seem confused, and some even help her. I would say Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen is an improvement. Thank God, the actor Alex Russell didn't act like John Travolta as Billy Nolan. I didn't like how the movie didn't explain anything that they add such as the topic of Carrie explaining to her mother, that she is not the only one who harbors telekinetic abilities. Where did that come from? Another thing, I hate about this movie is how it was shot. Multiple shots of the pig blood coming down was too much. The out of place dressing montage was just bad. Awful slow motion car crash's deaths scenes. The senseless principal scene with Chris Hargensen's father suing the school. This movie wasn't that long 1 hr 40 minutes, it really could had been cut down to 90 minutes. A lot of the scenes felt like fillings with nothing new to add to the plot. Overall: this movie is way better than 1999's The Rage: Carrie 2 and the 2002's remake. Still, this is the personification of pointless movie remakes as it didn't outshine the original.",Carrie

45,Reno-Rangan,"Not a bad remake, I quite enjoyed it",7,22 February 2014,"I haven't seen the original version which was based on the novel by Stephen King, the famous horror story writer. Kinda simple and plain story, but very good. Better than modern gore movie on teen subject. Well remade movie from the director of 'Boys Don't Cry'.Recently I have not seen any good horror so this movie gave me what I was expecting from this genre, a watching satisfaction. I know many people did not like it, but my horror movie taste is vastly different from most of the movie buffs so I like it better than them.Julianne Moore and Chloe Moretz were good as usual. They had main roles in the story and a couple of others had a decent one. For Chloe it is a good progress, gives an opportunity to learn herself from different character from different genres.A little explanation was needed about the story before the first scene commence. It confuses a bit about daughter's psychic powers. It is no more 70s you know, people think very broadly in all the angles about what they see. The end was good, but like said, opening should have explained well. I think we can expect a sequel, maybe a prequel.This is not everyone's cup of a tea. Only a few people like me will like this movie and others give as usual logic explanation for following the critic's path.",Carrie
46,zkonedog,Carrie For A New Generation,8,4 March 2017,"Usually, when watching a remake of a great movie, I'm looking for something new that it adds to the story or characters. If it doesn't bring anything fresh or original to the table, then why step in again at all? ""Carrie"" is an exception to that rule, however, as instead of providing any substantially new material it essentially gives the story/character an update into modern cinema.For a basic plot summary, ""Carrie"" tells the story of young Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), a strange girl who lives with her religious fanatic mother Margaret (Julianne Moore). When Carrie is humiliated at school after unknowingly receiving her first ""curse of blood"" (menstrual period) in the women's locker room, she begins to develop inexplicable telekinetic powers. Drawing the ire of school ""mean girl"" Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) but gaining the friendship of Sue Snell (Gabrielle Wild), Carrie is asked to prom by Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) in what turns out to be the defining night of her life in more ways than one.Despite being little more than a straight remake of the original, I still thoroughly enjoyed the concept of the new ""Carrie"" because of how it brings the story into the modern cinematic cannon. This is one of the great coming-of-age stories ever told (adapted from the pen of Stephen King, his first widely successful written work), but getting the younger folk to see the original would be like pulling teeth. Show them the trailer for Sissy Spacek's ""Carrie"" and they will blow it off as a ""typical weird 70s movie"" (which of course it isn't at all, but...). So, while the Carrie story didn't ""need"" to be remade, per se, as the original was so good, it did ""need"" to be remade in order to refresh the story for generations to come.Of course, one cannot help but compare this 2014 version with the 1976 original, and in doing so there are arguments for/against both interpretations. For example, the ending to the original is much better and that film may actually have a little bit higher ""creepy"" factor due to the horrific Spacek facial reactions. On the flip side, I like how this new version casts actors much closer to their ""screen age"", giving the film a bit more of a ""believe-ability"" factor.One of the hallmarks of the original ""Carrie"" was always its incredible acting, and this version also continues that trend. Moretz is a great Carrie (albeit in a different sort of fashion than Spacek's manic portrayal), while Moore remarkably matches Piper Laurie's complicated turn as Margaret White, who may just be the most interesting character of either film. All the auxiliary players are also just fine, again just different from the ""household names playing teenagers way below their actual ages"" approach taken by the original.Overall, 2013's ""Carrie"" is a wonderfully spooky film that (in keeping with King's novel) is much more ""human/psychological drama"" than ""horror"". If pushed, I might have to give a slight nod to the original (but that is strictly because that 1976 movie was the first time I had ever been engulfed in the challenging, uncomfortable story that defines ""Carrie""). However, this remake does a great job of updated the story/characters to present it in a way better suited for today's generation. Had I been watching the narrative for the very first time with this movie, I think I would have had the same reactions I did upon my first viewing of the original. ""Carrie"" is a story that deserves to live on through the generations, and this film makes it possible for it to do so.",Carrie
47,filipemanuelneto,A remake that does not bring anything new but it's still entertaining.,4,24 September 2016,"We are facing a remake of a horror classic, 1976. I have not read the Stephen King's book in which both films were based, but I saw both movies and I recognize that this film is no more than an ""update"" of the story. One has copied the other, simple. The bad part is that this movie does not add anything new. The good part is renewing interest in the story itself, attracting a new generation which otherwise would hardly have access to the 1976 original film (nowadays, ancient movies are a rarity in theater or on television).Since the film copies most of its predecessor, the script is not new. The provision of the actors is reasonable. The main role was in charge of the young Chloë Grace Moretz, an actress who fulfilled his character without surprise or do something remarkable. Julianne Moore got the role of Carrie's mother, a woman blinded by religious fanaticism and fear of sin. The experienced actress did a great job and made this film a much more enjoyable experience. The prom scene is the climax, but leaves a lot of questions. In her anger, Carrie shows a great control of her skills but, at the same time, she appears to lose control of them, and the situation itself. This contradiction makes no sense. Visual, special and sound effects are several, but not very impressive. Which leaves us impressed is the situation itself.In short, this movie is a nice revisiting of an old success. It doesn't bring anything new, but it's still nice to see.",Carrie
48,leonblackwood,The Original Is Better! 4/10,4,14 June 2014,"Review: This movie is no way near the original. I think that it was the shock value of the first movie and the fact that there wasn't that much movies in that genre out at that time.. Personally I thought that the girl that played the lead, was a bad choice by the director. Julianne Moore, the lady that played her mother, would have made a much better Carrie because she suited that scary and weird type of role, extremely well. The ending extremely epic, but there wasn't the same intensity as the original. I think that it's because we know what's coming, right from the beginning, so all of the scenes leading up to the prom were irrelevant. Anyway, the movie is watchable, but they should have just left the original alone. Average!Round-Up: Chloe Moretz was wicked in the original Kick Ass and I liked her in the Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp, but I don't think that she really suited this role. I didn't really find her that scary to be playing the Sissy Spacek classic, and she's way too cute to be the outcast psycho at school. All of the other teenagers in the movie didn't really stand out that much because we have seen these type of roles many many times before, but for me, it really was Julianne Moore who stood out from the rest. The director has obviously set everything up for a sequel, but personally, I think that it need another reboot before they try and start a franchise, even though it doubled its money.Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $85millionI recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the original Carrie and who like loads of blood and gore. 4/10",Carrie
49,TheMovieDiorama,"Carrie opts for less blood, minimal religious fanaticism and zero scares.",4,10 July 2019,"Let me just whip out the old ""Rules on Remakes"" book. No need to blow the dust off, I'm often opening this beast up. Let's see here...ah! Rule number one: Don't remake a film if the modern version is to be nearly identical to its original. Rule number two: If already adapted from a book, and considered a near-perfect adaptation, just don't bother. And rule number three: Don't cast Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie White. Woops! Looks like Peirce didn't do her homework. Based on King's eponymous novel, Carrie, a shy introverted outcast at school, is invited to go to the prom but soon realises she will not receive the happy ending she dreamt about.De Palma's 1976 adaptation is a masterclass in horror, blood-soaked filmmaking. This version has already lost points for even trying, and unfortunately not coming close. But let's put aside the comparisons. Carrie only works depending on the casting of the titular role. The social ineptness and fanatical upbringing has to be believable in order to feel sympathy towards her as a person. And, as talented as Moretz is as an actress, this role is not suitable for her. At no point did I truly believe she was a social outcast being bullied and minimised by her student peers. Firstly, she's far too beautiful even with the knotty hair. Secondly, the unassertive behaviour consistently felt forced, particularly during her first menstrual period. The entire plot revolves around Carrie, get that casting incorrect and the film fails miserably.The focus on smartphone-era bullying instead of religious nurturing meant that the latter felt like an afterthought and often out of place. A dire shame considering Moore gives an understated performance as Carrie's fanatical mother. The discovery of her telekinetic powers held no thematic substance, unlike the novel and original adaptation, resulting in a necessary gimmick for the blood-soaked third act. And mediocre visual effects over practical work, especially the broken mirror shards.For a ""re-imagining"", this is wholly unnecessary and unchanged. It's not the worst adaptation/remake to ever be conceived. But despite a talented cast who all give good performances, even Greer was excellent casting, it just came across as artificial. A horror now turned tragedy, but with no real connection to the titular character due to a terribly miscast Moretz. Stick to De Palma's adaptation.",Carrie
50,matthewssilverhammer,Bad teen drama parading around as a supernatural horror film simply pales in every aspect to original,3,2 November 2013,"""Carrie"" is the most recent horror retread to come out of Hollywood's ""We're-out-of-ideas!"" machine, and like its many predecessors (Halloween, Evil Dead, etc) it falls short of the original. Maybe it's unfair to compare this film to a classic, but ""Carrie"" is asking for it, being such a literal remake, even down to the framing of some shots. And where it does deliver freshness, specifically in a brand new opening scene and its handling of Carrie's powers, it stumbles.The film follows Carrie (Moretz), an outcast teenager who juggles fitting in at school and dealing with her overtly religious, abusive mother (Moore). On top of this, she is discovering that she may have telekinesis, which causes more harm than good. Moore is the standout in the cast, but that's not saying much as most of the acting is one-dimensional and the dialogue is idiotic. Moretz, who is normally a strong presence, simply lacks the natural sadness, strangeness and imminent menace of Spacek's Carrie. It's a bad sign in horror films when scenes intended to frighten evoke laughs, and ""Carrie"" has it in spades. Even though the unique and dynamic story and mother-daughter relationship keep this from being a complete bore-fest, what we're left with is a bad teen drama parading around as a supernatural horror film that simply pales in every aspect to the original. It's sloppy, lazy, forgettable, and ultimately useless. Skip this one. Go see ""Captain Philips"" or ""Gravity"". Better yet, stream the 1976 ""Carrie"" off Netflix.",Carrie

52,GOWBTW,This remake is very uplifting to say the least!,8,18 October 2013,"Who can't forget the magic Brian De Palma did in 1976 version of ""Carrie"". That's the one Sissy Spacek made famous. A timid teenager, bullied by her peers, lashes out on her tormentors with her telekinetic fury. Well, it's the same thing here, only more extreme! Chloe Grace Moretz now plays the title character. And really puts Spacek to shame in the role. Carrie White(Moretz), is a social misfit who is bullied unmercifully by her peers in high school. Her mother Margaret(Julianne Moore) is more harm than help to her child in need. The mother is a religious zealot who makes her life more miserable by the moment. She pervert the Word of God. She indefinitely full of herself. It all starts of a game of water volleyball. Then the famous period scene in the shower. And the girls taunt Carrie to ""Plug it Up!"" Then most of all, the prom. When Carrie lashed out, she lashed out! This version of burning down the school makes DePalma's look like child's play. At least Carrie knew how to get the ones who wronged her. Sue(Gabriella Wilde) was one of the bullies with a conscious. This movie also shows the errors of bullying, and I too, find it unacceptable. The way Mortez displays Carrie's powers is really out there. The effects were great. Though some of the scenes were a little overboard in a way. I liked DePalma for his originality, but for Kimberly Peirce, she did herself well here. Both Mortez and Moore did very well in there role in the movie. Not the best, nor the worst, it's the finest Stephen King remake I have ever seen. A must see for Stephen King fans. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",Carrie
53,jtindahouse,Missing De Palma's powerful direction but still passable,7,7 May 2014,"It's hard when you're watching a remake and you're familiar with the original not to compare every little aspect of it as you're watching. It's fun in a way. 'Carrie' (2013) certainly holds its own amongst the abundance of remakes that have been produced in the last 5-10 years. The casting was't perfect and the direction was lacking a sense of authority over the story for a large portion of the movie, but the final quarter was done well enough to forgive a lot of these problems.If you're also familiar with the original you would have probably had the same thought as me going in - the whole thing has to be judged on the prom scene. Maybe not the 'whole' thing but certainly a large portion was always going to depend on that. For me it was done very well. Director Kimberly Peirce's 'Carrie White' character is a little different to the original. She's very aware of her capabilities and by the end is almost using them like a witch from 'Harry Potter' (minus verbalising any spells of course). The brilliant split screen De Palma used is absent this time around, replaced by more mayhem, more chaos and more brutal death scenes.The one part of the film's final act that didn't even come close to living up to the original was the very final infamous 'arm scene'. I'll never forget seeing that as a kid, it gave me such a fright I had to ask my dad not to let me watch any more horror movies ever again (something I'm pretty sure I revoked the very next night knowing me). This time around the format is changed and we see the arm come out of a woman giving birth. This made no sense at all to me. The brilliance of the original scene was that everything was quiet, the audience thought all the chaos and violence was over and it was just going to fade to black. Then BOOM! it hits you. This time around the girl is already screaming from the pain of giving birth, we are already aware something is wrong and thus the sudden arm has no effect at all. I don't think knowing that there was a good chance it was coming, even before going into the film, had any thing to do with the lack of effect. Very poor direction.Chloë Grace Moretz was poorly cast for me. Shes an above average actress there's no problem with that, and I feel she pulled off the prom scene very well. But she's far too beautiful to play Carrie White. I have a feeling in this day and age you just couldn't get away with casting someone unsightly (for lack of a better word) enough to really pull off the character. De Palma had the freedom back in the day to perfectly cast Sissy Spacek and the film was better for it. Julianne Moore was average in her role. She wasn't able to bring the same intensity Piper Laurie was in 1976 but I feel that was more to do with the way her scenes were written and possibly directed than any fault of her own. The couple of actors that blew me away though were Gabriella Wilde and Ansel Elgort. They didn't have overly challenging roles admittedly, but they had screen presence and charisma in abundance.Peirce puts in a credible effort, there's no doubt about that. You never know how much a director's hands are tied by studios, budgets etc. so it's hard to be too critical of anything lacking. I just feel De Palma had a real stamp on the original, that made it a classic and that was perhaps missing here. Nevertheless it's a good watch. I wondered whether the story would be too simplistic for today's 'ADD' audiences but I think Peirce did a good job of pacing and made it so this wasn't a problem. Worth a look.",Carrie
54,Captain_Couth,"Finally, a decent theatrical version of the classic Stephen King novel",9,15 July 2015,"Carrie (2013) is the third version of Stephen King's first published novel (under his real name) and is by far the best. Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) is a teenage girl who along with her mother Margaret (Julianne Moore) have been mocked, ridiculed and shunned by the townsfolk. All this has been building up inside Carrie whose telekinetic powers have began to peak. It's only a matter of time before everything reaches a boiling point and explodes with a vengeful fury that will bring the high school and town to its knees.The movie follows the book fairly closely with Chloë Grace Moretz doing an excellent job of capturing the character of Carrie. I also enjoyed Julianne Moore's interpretation of Carrie's mother Margaret White and her religious fanaticism whilst giving her an insight into why she is like that. I had no problems with the changes and updates to the storyline because not only I felt it was necessary, but it improved the overall source material. The most important change to this version of the book is that the actors were all played by people in their teens or close to it instead of their mid to late twenties.I hope that the original cut of the film is release someday because I read that they removed over a half hour of footage due to a confused preview screening audience.",Carrie
55,billcr12,Nothing New,5,15 March 2014,"Stephen King's novel was first done in 1975, and the author stated that it was perfectly fine and there was no need for a remake. He was right, and this version proves his point. Carrie is well played by Chloe Grace Moretz, and her crazy mother by the equally good Julianne Moore. That is the only positive aspect of the film, as the rest of the cast is fairly bad. The supposed high school kids all appear to be at least twenty five and the movie is blaringly loud at times, which caused me to lower and raise the volume several times. Carrie is a sheltered teenage girl with a religious fanatic mom who constantly drills fire and brimstone into the poor lass. While taking a shower after gym class, Carrie sees blood and has no idea that she is menstruating, and this causes a scene with her classmates who throw tampons while laughing at the hysterical girl. She later discovers telekinetic powers which prove quite useful later on. Isolation and revenge are the main points here, but other than Moretz and Moore, there is no reason to watch Carrie.",Carrie
56,DarkVulcan29,This remake of Carrie makes the 1976 version look like a social satire.,9,27 October 2013,"Usually remakes of great films destroy what was good about the film, like Psycho(1998),and The Bad News Bears(2005) to name a few. But the same cannot said about Carrie, cause this remake not only makes a horror film, but it also displays the horrors of reality, like bullying and crazy overbearing parents, the original had that, but this version presented it in a very realistic way.Chloe Grace Moretz is no Sissy Spacek, but she really surprised me on how good she was, cause she is a teenager playing a teenager, unlike Spacek who was in her mid 20's. Not saying she was bad, but Moretz was good in her own way. Julianne Moore was also good has Carries crazy mother, for those who think she can't act, may think differently after seeing this, she really plays crazy perfectly, unlike Piper Laurie who came across has silly and over the top.The effects are also great, the scenes where Carrie uses her powers, now understand the 1976 version, cause they where on a tight budget. Moretzs performance during the prom scene is very different, it comes across like she is not controlling her powers, but more like her powers are controlling her. And all the supporting cast are pretty good, trying to be believable, not playing typical stereo types.",Carrie

There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",Carrie
58,strong-122-478885,"Blood, The Bible & Creepy Carrie And Her ""Dirt Pillows""",1,16 December 2014,"Well, here are 2 things that I quickly learnt while watching this tediously unimaginative ""re-imagining"" of a so-so horror story from 1976.(1) - Teens (in their unfathomable capacity to be cruel & hateful) are, today, even worse bullies than they were back 40 years ago. It seems that it's especially the girls who tend to be the most vicious and spiteful in their deliberate treachery towards others.(2) - Religious fanatics are even more retarded today then you could ever imagine them to be.Anyways - In what seemed like a ""Made-For-TV-Movie"" - I thought that both Julianne Moore and Chloe Moretz were utterly despicable in their pathetically annoying portrayals as a mother/daughter wacko team.I really can't say which one of these 2 actresses I thought stank the worst in their part. Between the brittle Moore forever chewing up the scenery and the bug-eyed Moretz underplaying her part to the point of being a total non-entity, neither of these women showed even the slightest bit of conviction in the parts that they were playing.This dumb movie contained absolutely no surprises, whatsoever. And making the story more spectacularly gory and violent than the original only served to prove the point that all of the characters in this dimwitted tale were not worth the slightest bit of attention at all.And, finally - Since when does possessing the gift of telekinesis also include allowing that person the ability to fly?.... Sheesh! Like, give me a break already!",Carrie
59,dfranzen70,"Carrie, she's so very... scary?",7,9 October 2014,"Stephen King's 1974 novel has been filmed three times so far. I didn't catch the 2002 cable version, but I can compare the 1976 theatrical release with last year's offering from director Kim Peirce (Boys Don't Cry), and my feeling is that the newbie acquits itself quite well.You're probably familiar with the plot, since the book has sold millions of copies worldwide. A teenage girl, living with her religious-zealot mother and suffering the scorn of the cool kids at school, discovers she has telekinetic powers that she then uses to exact her revenge for her years of mistreatment. This time, our titular protagonist is played by Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass), who looks like Amanda Seyfried's slightly younger sister. Carrie has always been viewed as an outsider/freak by most of the school, but things go really far south in the very first scene, when the poor girl gets her first menstrual period – in the middle of the shower in the girls' locker room. This comes as a major surprise, since her mother (Julianne Moore) has never brought up the subject before. Think the other girls are sympathetic? Brother, you don't know high school girls.After the girls have had their fun at Carrie's expense, their gym teacher Mrs. Desjardin (Judy Greer) confronts them. As their cheerleader coach, she informs them that they can either run laps (and plenty of them) or be suspended from school for their part in the harassment. Most of the girls comply, because suspension means no prom, and no prom to a high school girl is unthinkable. One girl who doesn't comply is Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday, Youth in Revolt), who has a boyfriend from a different, rougher high school and who is probably from the wrong side of the tracks to begin with. Chris rebels and is consequently suspended, which means no prom for her. Where do you think she places the blame for her situation? Poor Carrie White.Another participant in the hazing incident is Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde), who feels genuinely guilty and ashamed about her part; this leads her to ask her BMOC boyfriend Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom instead of Sue. Tommy needs to be talked into it, but in the end it's what his girl wants. But things don't go as he, Sue, or Carrie plan.Chris and Sue, two close friends, react quite differently to their punishments (did I mention that video from the locker room was later posted on YouTube?). Sue, immediately remorseful, decides that not only should she not go to prom, as punishment, she should convince her beloved Tommy to take the tormented Carrie in her stead. Sue, hostile and vindictive, is meanwhile out for revenge, perhaps at any cost.A minor quibble might be Moretz. Not her acting, mind you (or that of most of the cast), but rather her appearance; Moretz seems to me to be too attractive for the role of Carrie White. At no point here does Carrie look like an ugly duckling, even before she becomes a swan. Sissy Spacek, in the 1976 version, had more of that plain-Jane look than Moretz can pull off. Still, at least Moretz was still a teenager when this movie was made. Even Doubleday, as Chris, is 26.I found Carrie to be appropriately terrifying, much as King probably imagined it when he originally put words to pen. The denouement is spectacularly staged, as are the culmination of the prom and Carrie's interactions with her fanatical mother. The telekinesis scenes are fantastic, a step up from the '76 version. And there's lots of blood. Sure, most of it's came from a pig, but it's blood nonetheless.",Carrie
60,stevendbeard,Descent Remake,6,18 October 2013,"I saw ""Carrie"", starring Chloe Grace Moretz-The Kick-Ass movies, My Friends Tigger & Pooh-t.v., Julianne Moore-Don Jon, The Kids Are All Right; Judy Greer-Two and a Half Men-t.v., The Village and Portia Doubleday-Big Mommas:Like Father, Like Son, Youth in Revolt.This is a remake of the 1976 'Carrie', so as far as the plot goes, there is not much difference between them. The biggest changes are the better effects and the existence of the internet-including cell phones. An example being the shower scene when Chloe has her first period and the other girls make fun of her and video tape her, putting it on the internet. Another difference is the age of the stars playing Carrie; Sissy was in her late 20's in the original and Chloe is 16. The movie starts with Julianne giving birth to Chloe and you get a little insight into Julianne's mind. Then, you see the bullying that Chloe endures, mostly led by a fellow student, Portia, and also the crazy ranting of her mother-they do go into more details about why Julianne acts the way she does. Judy plays a sympathetic gym teacher to Chloe. As Chloe grows older, she develops telekinetic powers, you know, like Professor X of the X-Men, she can move objects with her mind. Her new powers seem to be triggered by her emotions. When Portia plots an attack on Chloe during Prom night, Chloe looses control and all hell breaks loose. It's a descent remake for the present generation who have not seen the original. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I would probably buy it on DVD but if you are more of a fan of the original, it would be a good rental.",Carrie
61,dee.reid,Better than I expected...,8,27 October 2013,"I know there's a lot of people out there who will bash Kimberly Peirce's ""Carrie,"" a 2013 remake of Brian De Palma's brilliant 1976 shocker of the same name - both of which are adaptations of Stephen King's first hit horror novel. I'm an admirer of ""Carrie"" (the 1976 version starring Sissy Spacek), so, like everyone else, I was highly skeptical of yet another pointless remake/reboot of an established horror classic. The remake is good, but it's no ""Carrie"" (1976). It's very much a product of today's time, with our culture's current obsession with technology - Facebook and YouTube figure prominently here - and yet it's still very much the same story, about a troubled girl, the titular Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz), a shy and repressed teenager who develops deadly telekinetic powers that she then uses against those who have tormented her (including her mother, a fundamentalist Christian nut-case, played here by a superb Julianne Moore). The biggest difference here (and the film's greatest mistake, in my honest opinion) - other than the advances in special effects technology and more gore - is Carrie's gradual realization of her abilities and the potential danger they pose. The film treats this in such a way that they come about in a fashion reminiscent of any superhero movie you've probably seen in recent years. I guess this was a way of luring in stragglers from the superhero movie genre and any tweens of the 21st-century MTV generation. All in all, ""Carrie"" is a worthwhile horror remake that any die-hard fan of the original 1976 ""Carrie"" should see at least once, even if only to prove their loyalty to the original by mocking the (horrid) remake.8/10",Carrie

While no self-respecting American high school chick would uncover her privates in the ladies' locker room (last century or this), nudity runs rampant in the PORKY'S meets DEBBIE DOES DALLAS first version of CARRIE. With all the Ta-Ta's on parade, one half of that movie's audience instantly is turned into voyeurs, incapable of appreciating the nuances of a story exposing the seamy side of underage bullying. Like Lady Godiva, CARRIE remake director Kimberly Pierce rides in on her white horse to set the record straight, excising Sissy Spacek's gratuitous nakedness in the shower and replacing it with scenes of young men behaving themselves, primping for their prom. This CARRIE has the decency to stay underground once buried, just as she knows to leave on her white panties as she showers at school, in case she trips on a feminine hygiene device. Way to corral those horny toads, Ms. Pierce!",Carrie
63,meeza,Don't carrie on with this one! Another remake hell!!,5,18 March 2014,"Why o why do Hollywood filmmakers get ""carrie"" away and decide to remake classic horror 70's movies to a new generation that can care less about the 70's movies? And this monstrosity of a mistake has once again been executed in the remake of Brian DePalma's classic telekinetic revenge horror flick ""Carrie"". Director Kimberly Pierce, most famous for directing the gripping ""Boys Don't Cry"", sure made me cry in how she remade ""Carrie"" into a ridiculous imitation about a bulled teen named Carrie who just wants to be liked; but circumstances lead Carrie to end up in a bloody prom affair that causes her to go all telekinetic cra-cra against her tormentors and the entire school population for that matter. Oh and of course, Carrie does not have it too good at home either living with a maniac overreligious psychotic mommy. Well, I don't know why I got ""carrie"" away there with the plot of ""Carrie"" which is known to most of you. Chloe Grace Moretz does a decent job playing the title character, but it was not Sissy enough for me;, if you get my Spacek homage there for Sissy's brilliant leading work in the original. The great Julianne Moore goes acting overboard in her clownish work as Carrie's mother Margaret White. The film's screenplay was very dull and cliché-ish and did not cut like a knife and did not feel so right, sorry Bryan Adams. Her name is still ""Carrie"", but her cinematic power has faded. So run away far from this remake as fast as you telekinetic can! ** Needs Improvement",Carrie
64,estebangonzalez10,Another Unnecessary Remake,5,4 December 2013,"""There are other people out there like me who can do what I can do.""And there are other people out there that have adapted the same novel that this film is based on. Brian de Palma did in the 70's and the film has reached some sort of cult status since then. I was never a huge fan of that film and really didn't care too much for this remake. I never found Carrie's character terrifying so I didn't expect this to be a horror movie either. The reason I did decide to go see this was because I really like Chloe Grace Moretz and have seen almost everything she's done. Despite how much I like her, I don't think she brought anything new to the role of Carrie and wasn't able to carry this film. The entire film felt more of a remake of De Palma's film than a reimagining of Stephen King's classic novel. This version didn't bring anything new and thus felt completely unnecessary. The bullies in this film are so stereotypical and over the top that the film felt like a comedy at times. The greatest thing about Carrie was Julianne Moore's performance as the overzealous religious fanatic. I thought she was great, but the rest of the cast didn't really convince me beside one or two supporting performances. I still didn't hate this film, but I thought it was just another average and uninspired remake. At least director, Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry) hired actual teens to play the part of High School seniors instead of older actors like De Palma did. So at least she gets some credit for that. I wanted to like Carrie because of Chloe Grace Moretz, but this just wasn't the role for her. I just never connected with this film.Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a quiet and shy girl who lives with her overprotective religious fanatic mother Margaret (Julianne Moore). Carrie is different due to the fact that she's been sheltered by her mother for so long and for that reason she gets bullied on a lot at school. She has the misfortune of experiencing her first period in the locker room at school after her gym class. Her mother has never talked to her about this so when she sees the blood she panics and begins to scream. All the girls realize what is going on and so they begin to make fun of her and pretty soon the entire school finds out about it thanks to Chris (Portia Doubleday) who uploads the video on the internet. Her beautiful classmate, Sue (Gabriella Wilde), feels bad about the way she treated her and to try to make things right she asks her boyfriend, Tommy (Ansel Elgort), to ask Carrie to prom. Carrie begins to discover that she has telekinetic powers and decides to research in school during her free time, while Chris who was banned for prom plans the perfect prank on her. Little do they know that Carrie could be a dangerous if they continue to push her.If you've seen the Brian de Palma version then you pretty much know how the film is going to turn out. There is nothing fresh or unique about this film, but it isn't terrible either. The film has nothing to offer really and we as an audience are left waiting for the build up to the infamous prom scene. If you enjoy mindless films than you will probably enjoy Carrie, but if you were expecting a reimagining than you will leave disappointed. In a time where teenage bullying is hotter than ever, Carrie could have brought some new insight, but it failed to do so. It never says anything new about being a social outcast and in the end you have to wander what the point of the entire film was.",Carrie
65,mattkratz,not bad,8,3 February 2014,"This movie was pretty faithful to the book, with some ""modern updates."" (i.e. smartphones, youtube uploads, better special effects, etc.) While it couldn't hold a candle to the original, it still was pretty good, with Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore good in the leads. The climactic blood-being-spilled-all-over-her-and-she-goes-berserk scene was well done and a good highlight;that was best in the second movie. Overall, I think the best part of this film was the lead performances and the suspense. It will be interesting to see how Leonard Maltin reviews it in his upcoming book!

66,kluseba,A portrait of Western high school society instead of a straight splatter movie,8,23 October 2013,"""Carrie"" is based on a popular Steven King novel and has already been brought to the cinemas of this world in the seventies. This new version is a refreshing revamp and the topic is maybe more actual than ever before.Students are more and more living in a world where their parents get divorced and only care about their careers. Young students get in contact with alcohol, drugs and sex at very young age and have nothing left to discover. Hypersexualisation is omnipresent in all medias where artificial American pop stars and models have replaced authentic and honourable idols. Young people struggle to accept authorities at home, at school and even in situations of their everyday lives. It's hard for them to face confusion and frustration and instead of being mature enough to criticize themselves and their families, they project their bad feelings on other relatives, teachers and class mates. The main targets are shy and somewhat different people at school which they only see as weird outcasts. I guess we all have seen or heard of students who refused to go to school because they were going through hell there or who even went as far to take their own precious lives. While Eastern societies have kept some respect for authorities, the so-called democratic and free Western world has led to a system where everybody is criticizing everything and having an opinion about anything. People often feel the need to become monsters themselves to face the monsters around them. This fast paced, individual, material world is no good place for those who try to be different. Carrie is a symbol for all those who are suffering at such a young age and her final revenge is a symbol for the growing fear, hatred and pain that those young people feel inside and can't catalyse. In every school in every town in the Western world, we have a few potential Carries walking around like time-bombs. School shootings and suicide rates among students show us where the worst places. This movie manages to stay close to the original novel. At the same time, the events are playing in the present and a few necessary details have been added. Carrie is not only bullied at school. She is also bullied in social media when the antagonists upload movies of her on Youtube. Social media are hard to control and have become an anonymous place where anybody feels free to spread news about other people. Apart of her struggles at school, she has to deal with an extremely religious and severe mother. In the opening moments, you see how the mother thinks about killing her newborn child with a knife. This scene really touched me. Religious fanaticism is another big problem in our societies. People think their religion is the only one that counts and they go very far to spread this message in sometimes very ignorant and violent ways. There is no problem at all with being religious but with hating and judging people who think differently.Carrie's situation at home is not only connected to religious fanaticism but also to another problem in modern society. I'm talking about nuclear families with divorced parents, single parents, parents with new partners and so on. These days, people are having their first sexual experiences at a very young age and a lot of women get pregnant or even married before finishing their studies or having a stable job. These young parents always got everything and want to get everything no matter what. They want to have the perfect husband, they want to have many healthy children, they want to have a big house, a big television, a big car and the newest electronic devices, they want to have a job where there is not much to do but where they can get a lot of money, they want to go on vacation at least twice a year to escape from reality and so on. And while they are trying to get everything at the same time, their illusions are shattered and those who suffer are their own children who are growing up in a big mess. Carrie is growing up without a father and only hears bad things about him as she is completely controlled by her mother.This movie tells us the progressive downfall of a young and beautiful girl who just tries to be normal and get new friends. She tries really hard to do so and is very mature and a few people really care for her in a good way like the gym teacher or another girl from the water ball team at school. But if you get so much hate from everybody around you day by day as Carrie gets, you start to meet everybody with anger, ignorance and suspicion. You won't let the few ones who try to help you get close to you because you don't want to get hurt again and everybody soon becomes a potential enemy. ""Carrie"" is a suspenseful drama and only becomes a horror movie once more than one hour has passed. What follows is a tale of emotional destruction of the world around Carrie and finally of herself. Most viewers empathize and sympathize with her but once people get out of the cinemas, they close their eyes and ignore the Carries in the real world. The final scene shows us that even a bloody massacre with hundreds of victims doesn't change a thing at all. Some people sprayed ugly graffiti on Carrie's grave telling her to go to hell. The bullying of that poor child even continues after her death.If you care about thoughtful dramas and psychological suspense movies with strong character developments and good actors, this film is for you. Those who expect an atmospheric horror film or a splatter movie should look elsewhere.",Carrie
67,davispittman,Pretty good remake,8,13 May 2016,"Carrie the remake (2013) is actually a pretty good worthy remake of the classic Brian De Palma's adaptation of the Stephen King novel. Chloe Grace Moretz is really in the starring role of Carrie white. But oh my gosh, the one that shines is Julianne Moore as Margaret White. Julianne Moore delivered an unbelievably powerful and disturbing performance. She plays the absolutely crazy religious zealot mother. Judy Greer is the sympathetic gym teacher that comes alongside Carrie to help her, and is pretty good, she does not have a huge role, but she does well with the screen time given to her. The effects were good overall, they were a little lacking in a few instances, but overall good. I want to say that Ansel Elgort was so good in his role, I cried when his character died, I mean real tears, he played his role sooo well! I didn't like the slow motion death scene of Chris, I thought that looked kinda strange and not really natural, that was one of its few flaws. The sequences of violence weren't overly gory or too gross, they were pretty moderate. The prom massacre scene is pretty well done, the effects work, and the teen reactions and performances work as well. Julianne Moore's death scene is well constructed, with all the knives and scissors thrusting into her all at once at carries request. The other supporting actors besides the ones already mentioned did well too, wanted to give them a shout out as well. So yah overall a pretty good job well done. 8/10.",Carrie
68,3xHCCH,"Sensitive Acting by Moretz and Moore, But the CGI Goes Overboard",6,17 October 2013,"The story of ""Carrie"" is by now is a very well-known story. It was first a best-selling novel by Stephen King. it had already been given a film treatment by another master of suspense, Brian de Palma, with Oscar nominated performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Locally, there had just been a musical theater version of the same story which just closed last weekend. Carrie White is a teenage girl severely sheltered by her fanatically religious mother Margaret. She is a victim of bullying at school, especially by Chris Hargensen and her gang. When Chris goes overboard with her cruelty, her good friend Sue Snell felt very guilty. Sue asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie defies her mother's prohibition and accepts her prom date. Of course, Chris will not let Carrie have her fun. Little did they know the powerful telekinetic abilities that mousy little Carrie possesses!This 2013 film version is no means really necessary, but here it is. My main interest to see this film is for the performance of Chloe Grace Moretz in the title character. I only saw the two Kick Ass movies earlier this year, and I was looking forward to seeing Moretz play another type of character role. Chloe gives us a very sensitive performance indeed as the troubled Carrie. Her face is extraordinarily expressive even with the minimum of words said. Julianne Moore gives an over-the-top anguished yet sympathetic version of Margaret White with her Biblical mumblings and ravings and self-mutilation. Gabriella Wilde and Ansel Elgort who play Sue Snell and Tommy Ross respectively, are both very attractive, and do well enough in their roles. Portia Doubleday, the girl who plays the adversary Chris, does alright, though she did not have a good enough screen presence in my opinion. What I thought this production did wrong was unduly going overboard with computer-generated special effects. The director Kimberly Peirce seemed to have enjoyed her time with these new ""toys"" to the detriment of the film. This technology should have been this film's distinct advantage over the 1976 version, but the blatant lack of subtlety is jarring. Carrie can fly. Carrie can cause an entire street to break open with a single stomp. I guess you get the picture. Brian de Palma was able to create a tenser and scarier atmosphere at the prom and the house at the end with much less technology in the original film.Still I think it is still worth the time to witness the acting of Moretz and Moore. It is just too bad that the overwhelming CGI extravaganza did them all in towards the end.",Carrie
69,TdSmth5,An enjoyable version,7,6 February 2015,"Carrie is a shy girl teen girl. One day, at school, while showering she starts having her period. She completely flips out. The other girls make fun of her and mock her. One girl takes out her phone and films the drama. The gym teacher comes to her rescue.In the intro, we learned that her mom tried to a kill the fetus while she was pregnant. Now we learn that she's a religious nut. She thinks that everything is a sin, so she raises little Carrie completely isolated from the world, from boys. To punish Carrie she locks her in a closet.But as Carrie starts menstruating, she also notices that she's developing the power to control things with her mind. In literature class, she reads some sinister poem and everyone makes fun of her, even her teacher. But one boy supports her. She starts reading up on telekinesis. The gym teacher decides to punish the girls who ridiculed and bullied Carrie. In retaliation one of other girls posts the shower video online. That causes the entire school to make fun of Carrie. Another girl, Sue, who was part of the shower ridicule, feels guilty and goes against her friends in support of Carrie.All these girls are also banned from going to prom. Sue for some reason suggests her boyfriend take out Carrie instead. Carrie initially reluctant agrees and is delighted. Her mother doesn't want Carrie anywhere near prom, that forces Carrie to use her powers to lock her mom in the closet.At prom all goes well, until Carrie's enemy shows up, rigs the ballots so Carrie and the guy are elected prom queen and king. Then she and her boyfriend dump pig's blood on Carrie as she's celebrated as queen. Now Carrie unleashes all her fury punishing almost everyone in sight. But she still has to contend with her mother.Carrie is an enjoyable remake. I don't remember much of the original or the sequel and it's not productive either to compare all these movies with each other. While initially Carrie appears just way too shy, completely dysfunctional, and more like a caricature of a shy person, eventually we do end up caring for her. Moretz does a fine job and is likable. Also likable is the lovely Gabriella Wilde. The whole religious setting at home is also a bit too much. But the point is to empathize with Carrie, which we end up doing, as well as to root for revenge once it comes. For those who haven't seen the other versions, this one is a good introduction to the story.",Carrie
70,aharmas,Now This Family is Quite Dysfunctional,9,20 October 2013,"Almost forty years ago Brian DePalma came up with a superb adaptation of the Stephen King bestseller, a slick, scary, and quite disturbing film that showed teenagers were quite a troublesome bunch, and that every action provokes a reaction, a particularly dangerous one if your prey has telekinetic powers.Peirce has adapted and directed a very good adaptation of the story and the movie. It's also very intense and benefits greatly from two marvelous performances: Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore, as the two women who have been tormented by the mother's misguided belief that they are being punished by divine forces. As it's typical in these situations, misunderstandings go a long way in being the source of terrible deeds, and ""Carrie"" is the ultimate example of what happens when people become obsessed and traumatized by their beliefs.Juliane Moore's mother is downright scary. Her portrayal easily matches and surpasses Piper Laurie's 1976 turn. In this film, we see and find out the source of her psychosis. She's more violent, aiming her fear and hate to anyone who walks in front of her and/or disagrees with her point of view. There are of course, better special effects, and these are used well to illustrate how different people perceive sights and sounds.The true find is Chloe, a younger and arguably better portrayal of the main character. She takes Carrie deeper into a self-imposed cocoon, one of self-defense and fear, created by her mother's over protectiveness and her friends' constant abusive comments. The opening scene in the communal shower was a shocker a few decades ago, and the new one is a bit more vicious and dangerous because it involves the relationship between teenagers and technology. It brings out more dangerous implications.Soon, Carrie is the target of retaliation and a couple of kids' remorseful actions. What happens in the gym is the apocalyptic end to the sins of the many. No one is spared, and everyone is bound to be affected by the actions of a few. Hell literally breaks loose as Carrie can't hold her emotions any longer, and soon people are electrocuted, slashed to pieces, crushed, and a few other ways in which Chloe unleashes her anger.Peirce has done a decent job keeping the heart of the story there, giving their due to the humanity rather than the effects. She has a keen eye for detail and works very well with the intense acting by Moretz. I loved Spacey withdrawn and shy teenager, but Moretz is more vulnerable, and yet in the last part of the movie she brings out that powerful essence that we have seen in the ""Kickass"" films and managed to give a bit of emotion to that movie about the French film pioneers. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her work.Finally, ""Chloe"" is teaching us a lesson about society, and how we haven't evolved much. It's not necessary to have any special type of powers. Hateful actions are most likely to result in something really scary.",Carrie
71,aidanratesmovies,"Better than The Rage, worse than the original",7,27 February 2021,"Although it unfortunately falls short of comparing to the 1976 original, Carrie take a firmer stance on its darker origins and sense of style, and provides for a decent- although somewhat shallow adaptation- that can be quite interesting to watch. Chloe Grace-Moretz stars as the titular character this time around and provides a fine performance, although nothing to the likes of the original or even the lead of the second film. It isn't that she is bad, but the direction with the special effects throughout, as well as some subpar dialogue, just makes for a ultimate weaker performance than the effort she put into it. Not at all her fault, but unfortunately not as good as it could have been earlier. Julianne Moore provides perhaps the best performance in the film as Carrie's mother, and the rest of the actors can vary from overdone to fine performances. The writing takes a darker stance towards the material at hand, as well as some beautiful cinematography to compliment it all. Unfortunately though, the films atmosphere feels a bit dull at times, and can struggle to keep viewers as interested as they could have been while watching the film. I adore the look of the film, and I found many moments throughout to be quite well done, and refreshing to see put in this type of form. But ultimately, Carrie is nothing but another fine remake in a sea of unoriginal ideas. It's a decent film, but it can never match the likes of the original, or many other outstanding King adaptations throughout the years. At least it was better than the second film.
My Rating: 7/10",Carrie
72,Amari-Sali,"Though remakes are tricky, the cast of Carrie use their talents and special effects to make it worth seeing.",8,17 October 2013,"Amongst the many actors and actresses who I love seeing in films or television shows, is Chloe Moretz. Though mostly known for being the foul mouthed Hit Girl in Kick Ass, and often being the little girl who seems more mature than how we usually picture 16 year olds, in this film we are reminded that as much as she has the ability to be strong, ferocious, and cunning, at the same time, as shown in part in Kick Ass 2, she is still very much a young girl. Which leads to why Carrie perhaps was the perfect role for her, for it seems to continue to show her evolution as an actress and show she isn't a one trick pony.However, I would be doing a disservice to the movie if I didn't mention her co- stars who really help push Carrie into a figure who you not only feel sympathy for, but want to see get revenge. First I must mention Julianne Moore who plays Margaret White, Carrie's mother, who is a haunting presence with intense eyes and intense beliefs, which makes her the parent you would only wish on enemies. Also, I must mention Portia Doubleday as school bully Chris. She takes on the very familiar role of the popular girl who bullies a helpless girl, and gives it new life. Then, there is Gabrielle Wilde, as the sort of innocent, and seeking redemption Sue; Judy Greer as Miss Desjardin, the school gym teacher who is one of the few, and first, to stick up for Chloe; and then there is Ansel Elgort who plays Tommy, the boy who Carrie gets a crush on, is Sue's boyfriend, and is the one who takes her to that fateful prom.Now, I'm sure most of you know the story since pretty much the trailer gives it away. A young quiet girl has a religious zealot for a mother and finds herself constantly bullied at school. One incident though begins to push her too far and with this, she has an almost X-Men like awakening in which powers manifest. At first she is confused, then intrigued, but as life gets harder and people become more difficult to deal with, she stops being the victim to circumstances, largely out of her control, and decides to get revenge on those who have long been hurting her. Needless to say, it is an interesting movie to release on Spirit Day. As for praise when it comes to this film, though highly cliché to say, I must admit that the film was a bit intense, but it is all thanks to Julianne Moore's performance. Her work as Margaret White is terrifying to the point where she could be the mother of all horror icons, the one who nurtured them in such a way that no wonder they all became twisted, that is how good she is. Her intensity, her use of religious madness, and the gruesomeness of the acts she commits against herself and Carrie, make your heart race and sometimes makes you want to turn your head due to the things she does. As for Chloe Moretz, she continues what we saw in Kick Ass 2, which is showing that as much as she is capable of being a bad-ass, she can also play soft, someone you can sympathize with, even imagine in a romance movie. And ultimately I feel that those who don't know the story may even have hope that all would work out in the end for her. Then with Portia Doubleday's Chris, I feel she breaks the mold when it comes to what we think of when it comes to teen-aged female villains. For a long time the standard has been based on Mean Girls, Regina George specifically, but I feel Portia has found a way to set a new precedent of the type of bully you love to hate. Lastly, I must mention that one of the main things this remake benefits from is the special effects. Between Chloe's powers and the death of some characters, you see some of the things which help justify the remake past making money.But, no movie is without fault. First and foremost, the amount of powers displayed by Carrie made me think I was watching a long introduction of a new X- Men character, or an alternate Jean Grey back-story. How often, and how open, she was with using telekinesis and studying it made it so that when it came to the big finish, it didn't seem as grand as it did in the original movie. Also, as much as I love Moore's performance, it can be divisive due to it possibly being seen as over the top, and maybe clichéd considering she is a Christian who twists the bible to fit her sense of morality. But probably my biggest issue was the whole revenge plot which came from almost getting suspended and not getting to go to prom. It seems so ridiculous and juvenile that though you are willing to go with it, at the same time as you see the effort put into the revenge, you can't help but roll your eyes.Overall: Worth SeeingThose who saw the original only have reason to see this due to the special effects you wish the original had and because Moore definitely goes further than the original mom. As for newcomers, though not the best horror or thriller out there, the performances and gore are sure to entertain you and give you something to talk about. However, I don't know if this is the type of film I would rush to see since it is good, but certainly doesn't have the makings of a classic. Still, I think it made for a nice way to spend a little more than an hour and a half.",Carrie
73,guisreis,Failed reboot that misses completely the tension of the original film,5,14 January 2016,"This remake is a pale, superficial and boring version of the original horror one, which has been well directed by Brian De Palma. You don't feel anything when you watch it, while the 1976 version makes you nervous, as it is highly psychological. In the 2013 remake, all the characters are unconvincing, including Carrie (who looks more like a Force user from a Star Wars reboot) and her mother (good actress Julianne Moore does a bad job here, just like in another unsuccessful remake, ""Psycho"" from 1998). In the original one, you feel deeply Carrie as a victim of bullying and her mother's fanatical religious- influenced behavior is truly disturbing. In this one, nothing impacts. A serious failure.",Carrie
74,raulfaust,Carry me in,8,8 December 2013,"Well, I'm not into comparisons between this version and the original. What I'm into saying is that 2013's picture is a modern version of the classic Carrie White story, which is, in my point of view, very satisfying. The acting, for instance, is very professional, with big congratulations for Julianne Moore for portraying such a religion paranoid like Carrie's mother. The rest of the cast is almost as great as her. Another good thing about this film is that Carrie isn't THAT weird and creepy as she's meant out to be; in here, she is weird only (or mainly) because her mother doesn't let he know anything, treating her like a nun or something. It's also good to see that not everybody is mean to Carrie; in fact, some girls end up helping her, instead of joking, which makes spectator doesn't feel THAT uncomfortable. Also, there are lots of well made scenes, thanks to an admirable directing, allied with a good plot that screenplayers wrote. Some scenes are unintentionally funny, like when Margaret is ironing and singing to a religious song fanatically-- I laughed out loud in that scene, since I find crazy people really really funny. The only thing I dislike in Carrie's story is that she ends up killing too many innocent people. I know she wasn't aware of who actually set a trap for her, but anyways, Mr. King shouldn't have made her kill so many people-- it made me feel not that sorry for her. All in all, this is a GOOD movie that make you feel like an hour and a half passed in a matter of minutes, not to mention the educational aspect of it.",Carrie
75,elliotjeory,Good remake,6,27 October 2019,As far as remakes go this was better than the usual horror remakes they do. Good story and well made and enough action to keep you entertained.

76,quincytheodore,X-Men Origin: Jean Grey rev... I mean Carrie Review.,5,13 November 2013,"In a partly unnecessary remake, Carrie has lost some of its dread and now looks terribly dismal instead of frightening. With the change, and also Chloe Morets as the leading actress, it seems this version is trying to invoke more sympathy to relatable case of bullying than to scare the audience with terror, which in its credit, works decently well. The talents give relatively good performance, although some of the script and characterization are muddled with exaggeration. The movie barely offers anything in term of novelty as it follows the source firmly, furthermore the plot is highly predictable and very 90s, in the end Carrie feels like a mild psychology thriller at best.Chloe Moretz as the titular abused girl is the embodiment of a dejected teen. It's nigh impossible to not feel compassionate towards her as she pleads and cries. This is strange since Carrie had somber tone in her, audience would feel apprehension, compared to that Chloe looks rather more innocent. She delivers more empathy inducing scenes and actually makes viewers cheer for her. If it's an intended objective of the movie, it's fairly effective.The role of creepy and misguidedly religious mother falls into Julianne Moore. She does a good job of setting unnerving sense of inescapable mentally threatening parent. It's not quite as scary, although it is disturbing. Relationship between her and the daughter is a strange, an affectionately insane one. The rest of the cast is mixed bag. Antagonist role of Chris (Portia Doubleday) is very unlikely to jump from high school prank to homicide attempt in one leap.Sue (Gabriella Wilde) is plain weird, it seems that there could be more interactions between her and Carrie, perhaps to offer more complex friendship plot, instead of exclusively apologetic distant gazes and failure to communicate. The movie's gym teacher, Desjardin (Judy Greer) has crude yet protective sense, she's a more youthful authority figure who is comfortable in high school environment, but her role seems a bit limited.The film is marred by a few unintentionally funny moments, and honestly the latter part is much more timid than most horror movies. Looking at Carrie discovering her power and becoming the telekinesis menace to society can be mistaken with X-men gone wrong. Some scenes are meant to be dramatic, but ultimately the closing feels anticlimactic. Aside from the tingling sense of eerie parental guidance and the unsettling corruption of innocence, Carrie is missing intense suspense; even its jump scares are juvenile.Despite the use of more relevant topic of bullying, great talents behind it, and the same ridiculous amount of blood, Carrie is merely a toned down dull rework of old movie.",Carrie
77,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Garbage compared to the 1976 version,2,13 August 2014,"Carrie is the classic story of bullying gone way too far and religion going crazy. Everybody knows Carrie, the girl nobody, not even her own mother, ever cared about, until she uses her telekinetic powers to change all of it.So, what's with the remake of the classic 1976 Carrie!? There are so many flaws with this new one that I can't even list 'em all, but the main one is the actress they chose for Carrie. In the novel Carrie is described as an overweight mousy-haired girl with zits all over her face and piggy eyes, a weird voice and always carrying a bible. So in the 2013 film, they picked Chloe Moretz, who honestly is the exact opposite of this description! It was a really bad choice. Then there's the soundtrack, it was stupid, and won't ever beat the eerie and beautiful score composed for the 1976 version. Carrie's mother in the 2013 one is not nearly as effective as in the original, nor does she look anything as described in the book. The SFX in Carrie 2013 were pathetic, I could do those effects with a pack of matches access to a school and a green screen for crying out loud! And why on earth was Carrie flying!? It wasn't an X-Men movie, was it?Simply put, the remake is a pathetic attempt to add to the other lousy remakes of classic horror films today. Remakes wrecked My Bloody Valentine and the Evil Dead, now they've wrecked Carrie! The 1976 film was timeless, with great acting, soundtrack and effects, there was no reason to remake it, it was just another lousy way to make some money off some emotional teenage girls who never got to see the original or bothered to read the book. Carrie's remake isn't worth your time, don't watch it, just stick to the book and original film, and to the production company, I hope you get to read this, because you did a very pathetic job, stop remaking classics and get some new ideas, already!",Carrie
78,rivertam26,Not completely unnecessary,7,22 July 2020,"This remake gets alot of undeserved hate. It's of course nowhere as good as the superior original. But I don't think anyone ever thought it would be. Queer director Kimberly Pierce's (Boy's Don't Cry) interpretation and adaptation of the material is not completely unnecessary. The setup is the same as Carrie is bullied by some girls at school and than begins to discover she has telekinetic powers. She of course makes it to the prom where a prank is pulled and everyone suffers a horrible fate because of it. In this version Jullianne Moore has the strongest impact as her overly religious mother and we get an idea of why. It seems she may be a lesbian and punishes herself everytime she is attracted to a woman. It also is implied that she was raped and Carrie was a result of that. It definitely adds a dimension to that story that wasn't there before. Pierce also interprets the main character differently. This Carrie has more control over her powers and the film is almost a setup for a superhero/villain origin story. Regardless although somewhat impressive it lacks the power and precision of the original film. Chloe Moretz Grace is also decent as Carrie but lacks the genuine touch and power of Sissy Spacek's performance. As for the others only Judy Greer as the gym teacher and the adorable and charming Anson Mount as her date make an impression. All in all it's a pretty good movie that leads up to a somewhat ridiculous but sort of bad ass finale. I wish Pierce would have kept it more subtle. In that I think the ultimate message of the movie about bullying, religious extremism, self worth and discovery would have been delivered more clearly.Budget: $30M
Box Office: $85M7.25/10",Carrie
79,punishmentpark,I have only myself to blame...,5,15 April 2016,"A remake of one of the ultimate horror movies can only go wrong, can't it? Julianne Moore seems to be a good choice to play the haunted Christian mother, yet she is no match for Piper Laurie. The same goes for Chloë Grace Moretz versus Sissy Spacek. Of course, I knew that. Beforehand. But I saw a couple of pretty sweet stills and thought I'd give it a go.Story-wise, Kimberly Peirce really upped the ante on various dramatic issues, and it works, but it did made me think more than once what this remake would have been like if the telekinesis part was completely left out. You know, Carrie evolving into a frantic, but still very human, killer, instead of the fantasy horror shenanigans (which is why I was very pleased to the series remake of 'Psycho'). The original gets away with those shenanigans since it was directed so perfectly by Brian De Palma, and of course because it has Sissy Spacek in the bewitching lead.The horror element never really comes into play until the infamous bucket of pig's blood is finally dropped, but I must say, it is a pretty decent finale. Together with some fairly decent attempts at updating the story, that does count for something.5 out of 10.",Carrie
80,Troy_Campbell,"Boring, tired and bland.",3,29 November 2013,"Chloe Grace Moretz has had some juicy roles in her (so far) short career: Isabelle in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, Abby in the spectacular Let Me In and of course, the hilariously invective Hit- Girl in Kick-Ass. All of those characters are mature beyond their years and Moretz nails them; but can she handle playing someone who acts her age? If this horrid remake is an accurate gauge then the answer is a resounding no. As the emotionally awkward Carrie, Moretz doesn't convince for even a split second. Seemingly stuck with one facial expression that is meant to convey fear, disappointment and embarrassment, it's a weak portrayal of an outsider who is meant to illicit sympathy but grates on the nerves instead. And this is even before you compare it to Sissy Spacek's masterful turn in 1976's Carrie. The young star is not the only problem in this underwhelming flick though; Julianne Moore is silly rather than spooky as Carrie's religious- nut mother, Marco Beltrami's score is depressingly uninspired and the penultimate climax (in the school hall) is criminally bland. I was truly expecting better with Kimberley Pierce (Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss) calling the shots, but alas, this is as tired and gormless as all the other cash-in horror retreads. Two memorable slow-motion deaths in the finale are the sole highlight and are impressive enough to bump this up half a star.",Carrie
81,capkronos,Weak carbon copy of the original film.,4,15 January 2014,"I noticed that Lawrence D. Cohen, who'd adapted the Stephen King-penned outsider's revenge novel for the Brian De Plama original, is again credited with this adaptation. Did he actually re-write this or did they just re-use his old script? Either way, I was shocked at just how closely this followed the 1976 film. Much of the same dialogue, many of the same camera movements (the pan shot up to show the bucket; the camera beginning to spin around Carrie and Tommy as they dance, etc.) plus weak copycat shots of everything from the fire erupting behind Carrie to the blood falling on her from multiple angles (laughably overdone in this one) are all recycled here once again. They even cloned the silly ""getting ready for Prom"" montage and if you think the one here is any less corny than the one in the original, you are mistaken. It is one thing to adapt a famous novel that's already been filmed and try to update it for the times, but it is a whole other thing to weakly emulate another director's visual style when you are doing so.What few ""new"" things have been added here are sadly not to the overall betterment of the core story. Including cyber-bullying in the mix is - in theory - a good way to update it, but it isn't elaborated upon enough to make it the least bit interesting and is presented almost like an afterthought instead of it being an integral part of the story. Images of Carrie's locker room humiliation being projected in front of everyone at Prom were simply carried over from THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 (1999), where they project embarrassing videos of Rachel at a party. In other words, this movie does absolutely nothing fresh or new with the concept. Nothing.Moretz's ""blossoming"" from an outcast to someone who could possibly be accepted by her peer group didn't come off at all. The transformation for Sissy Spacek in the original film was dramatic as she went from awkward, mumbling Plain Jane to a nice-looking, appealing Prom date. Here, Moretz looks exactly the same before and after. Her fresh-faced, squeaky-clean appearance throughout the film makes it's a hard swallow that Tommy (vacantly played by Ansel Elgort) could look at her wearing a dress and then suddenly be like ""Wow!"" when he barely paid her any mind before. I thought both Spacek and Angela Bettis in the 2002 version pulled this off better. Both actresses also actually modulated their performances; something young Moretz simply does not yet have the gravitas or skill to do.It's not just Moretz who pales in comparison. Julianne Moore is one of the best actresses working today, but she simply cannot compete with Piper Laurie's go-for-broke, thoroughly unhinged portrayal in the 1976 film. Moore is simply too low-key and restrained to make the part the least bit memorable; the same exact trap Patricia Clarkson fell into in the 2002 version. Whiny-voiced Judy Greer is just plain awful as the gym teacher and is absolutely no match for Betty Buckley's mixture of strength and compassion. A key scene in the original film (Buckley's character discussing her own Prom night disaster with Carrie used as a sort-of 'calm before the storm') has been removed from this one for no good reason. The fate of the character has also been altered; stripping this of an important element of horror and tragedy. None of the young actors portraying the bullies are able to broadly paint their personalities on screen in a memorable or notable way. Portia Doubleday probably comes closest in her portrayal of ringleader Chris Hargensen but she still doesn't seem quite as nasty and vindictive as Nancy Allen.There was a haunting elegance to the direction, score and photography in the original film and all of that is absent here. This film's ordinary visual presentation, point-and-shoot cinematography, generic music score and CGI effects do absolutely nothing to spruce up the familiar story. In other words, what exactly is the point? Like many other soulless cash-grabs remakes, this will be completely forgotten here in a few years while the original film will forever live on as a genre classic.",Carrie
82,Pumpkin_Man,A Fantastic Adaptation of Stephen King's Original Classic!!!,10,28 October 2013,"Ever since I was a kid, Carrie has been one of my favorite horror movies and I was psyched for the remake. Chloe Moretz was absolutely the perfect choice to play Carrie. She should win an Award! The makers of this film claim it's truer to the book, but it seemed more like a tribute to the original movie. There were a few things from the book that they added that weren't in the original like Sue's pregnancy, Chris's dad being a lawyer and the rain of stones. (I think most truest version is the 2002 TV remake with Angela Bettis) I loved Chloe's facial expressions during the Prom massacre. She looked psychotic and was enjoying getting her 'revenge' on her classmates.Carrie White is a shy misunderstood teen who constantly gets bullied by Chris Hargensen and her group. When Carrie gets her first period in the gym locker room, all the girls laugh and mock her. Sue Snell feels bad about this and asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom. When Chris drops pigs blood on Carrie at the prom, all hell breaks loose! I highly recommend CARRIE!!!",Carrie

84,ketgup83,Carrie can be considered as a good time-pass along with strong performances,6,18 January 2014,"As a fan of horror movies, I have always been excited to watch Carrie as I heard a lot about the original one directed by Brian De Palma. I was not scared but was not disappointed as well.Carrie White is a shy girl who has always been looked down by her college's student and has been outcasted due to her weird nature. Luckily, she is sympathized by one of her college's mate who invited her to the PROM. Things turn topsy turvy in the PROM night and hell break loose on the entire town. From the director of Boy's Don't Cry, Kimberly Pirece is not in a good form as much was expected from the film. However, if you see the movie as independent cinema , it is not bad either thanks to eye-grabbing performances by Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie and Julianne Moore as the fanatic mother. Few scenes will be bloody yet powerful especially when Carrie starts cursing the entire town. Dialogues are good. Cinematography is nice. Background score is superb. Carrie can be considered as a good time-pass along with strong performances. Decent 2.75/5",Carrie
85,blott2319-1,Pointless remake that makes the original look better by comparison,3,6 July 2020,"I'm not exactly fond of Stephen King's more mystical stories. In general, I like when things remain a bit more down-to-earth and real. Carrie rides the line between the two in an interesting way, because it contains a grounded story, but it has a supernatural element that plays into the whole thing. Yet one could argue, even that aspect is a metaphor that points to real things that happen in a young girl's life. I didn't have any great love for the original Brian De Palma movie, even though I liked parts of it, particularly the way the religious elements play into the story. I'd like to say this remake affected me in the same way, but it felt largely devoid of the emotional impact of the first film. Despite being a nearly scene-by-scene remake, this version of Carrie was flat and lacking in any of the horror I appreciated from De Palma. In its place was a boatload of gore and graphic violence that only served to lessen the power of the story. I suppose if you're someone who is so sympathetic with Carrie that you desire to watch the meticulous slaughter of the kids in her class (in full gruesome detail,) then this is the version for you. It just seems that some people, who did little or nothing wrong to her, were being destroyed with aggression that might not fit their crime.Julianne Moore is a wonderful actress and she does her best to recapture what Piper Laurie did in the original film. I don't think too much is lost in the mother's story thanks to the talent of Moore. However, Chloë Grace Moretz was miscast in this film. The one good thing she did was boost my opinion of Sissy Spacek's performance in the original. I didn't realize, until I saw someone else try their hand at this role, how perfectly it suited Spacek. Moretz tries to portray the extreme innocence of Carrie, but she struggles to sell me on it. There's something mature and wise in Moretz that comes through even when she's not trying. In fact, it's so present that one scene after she comes to terms with her abilities, she feels like a completely different person. The difference in her performance is almost off-putting, despite the fact that the character only spent some time researching telekinesis. Now she seems savvy, smart, and tries to teach her mother about things that it seemed like she didn't understand days earlier. This turn also throws off the climax of the film, because there seems to be so much more intent in the slaughter. Spacek acted like a girl out of control, but Moretz comes across as vindictive and evil. Needless to say, this version of Carrie didn't work for me, but perhaps I could watch the original now and appreciate it more in comparison.",Carrie
86,gizmomogwai,I already know her name,6,17 January 2014,"Three film adaptations (1976, 2002, 2013) plus one '90s sequel I haven't seen and I still don't think any of them really capture Stephen King's novel is a completely satisfactory way. The first film version is still the best, so one might in retrospect question whether having this one is worth it. But Carrie '13 isn't a bad film.There's some ""updating"" of the story- much of the bullying of Carrie happens via a cellphone and the Internet, which is how it's done today. In real life, that kind of bullying has led to tragedy, so it's believable that that pushes Carrie over the edge here. Beyond that, this is often too close to the 1976 film, making it feel a bit redundant- Tommy and Carrie are closer over a poem (this time he likes hers rather than the other way around). The teacher has Carrie look into the mirror to see how beautiful she is. Carrie has knives thrown at her mother instead of stopping her heart like in the book. Carrie's gravestone is vandalized and oh my god, is she rising from the grave? That's not in the book, either. At least this one avoids the debacle of the 2002 TV movie, where Carrie lives.That said, Chloë Grace Moretz- who previously did another weak horror remake, Let Me In- handles this part quite well. Julianne Moore is unsurprisingly also very good as the fundamentalist mother. The production values are smooth. This isn't a bad film, but falters in being based more on a film that already exists, rather than a great novel.",Carrie

88,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Carrie"" 2013",8,18 January 2014,"""Carrie"" 2013, the film that almost was awesome. Yeah I know that goes against the box office numbers and most cynical movie reviewers but ""Carrie"" was a pretty solid, emotion driven thriller. Closer to the short story written by Stephen King, this updated vision of the coming of age nightmare pays tribute to the 1976 while modernizing the characters to relate to 21st century horror fans. I think I like this version better than the original film. I didn't feel bored or frustrated while waiting for the story to explode into blood soaked chaos begging for the fire.The story is about Carrie White, a young girl who is about to enter womanhood. Unfortunately she is the psychologically neglected daughter of a bible-beating nut-job. Bullied at school by some very cruel classmates, Carrie transforms into a force of supernatural vengeance on a path to self destruction. It is a timeless and poignant tale that is very familiar. This film isn't the first redo for the ""Carrie"" story but in my opinion it is by far the best. Although the film is predictable to anyone who has spent countless seasons watching the classic film, or re-reading the story by Mr. King, Chloë Grace Moretz portrays the telekinetic school girl with more charm and depth. Sissy Spacek offers a more vulnerable, sorrowful Carrie and I enjoy her version immensely. I just feel that Moretz interpretation is more attuned to that outcast, sheltered, mentally scared character. I felt invested enough to stay connected through the parts of the film that almost seemed redundant and too close to the 1976 film. The film moves in that same somber slow atmospheric realm of depressed soul as the original and the characters are critically close to being two dimensional but the depth and breadth of Kimberly Pierce's vision of ""Carrie"" offers so much more substance to the story on screen that it carries the characters from scene to scene. However disappointing the lack of personality the characters seem to have in the first half of the film second and last act the energy and chilling vitality begins to shine through elevating ""Carrie"" into a more visceral, macabre film. The characters become more affective and viable, especially in the last act when things really start moving. Visually it all boils down to the effects and dark realization of Carrie's breakdown into an uncontrollable storm of death and destruction. Pierce offers more detail to the personal ""growth"" of Carrie and more celebration of the carnage the ensues. I enjoyed this film and believe that it deserves far more love from horror fans than it has been given",Carrie
89,khanbaliq2,This adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of my favorite films of the year.,7,25 October 2013,"I was eager to see Carrie and I'm glad I did. It's an engrossing film that deals, first and foremost, with bullying. It's based on Stephen King's 1974 novel of the same name but it's set in the modern day instead of 1979. The simple yet practical screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa shows us what bullying can be like now. But this is a film, and Carrie White's case is the extreme. She's abused both at school and at home. In my opinion Chloe Grace Moretz, playing Carrie, provides an excellent performance. She is magnetic. The film was always more interesting when she was on screen. Moretz obviously put effort into her facial expressions and body movement. At the end of the film she's simply terrific. Though covered in blood she still seemed like a heroine. Director Kimberly Peirce deserves some praise because she got good performances from the actors. She created a number of effective scenes and shot them well. For example, you can feel the joy when Carrie is finding out about her telekinetic powers and you can feel the sadness when she's dealing with her problems. The scenes are supported by a suitable score by Marco Beltrami. Steve Yedlin's appealing cinematography, often focusing on sunlight, is also a benefit. Julianne Moore's deeply religious Margaret White causes difficulties for Carrie. She often abuses her sympathetic daughter. Things are made worse by Carrie's situation at school, where Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) and her friends pick on Carrie. Doubleday is certainly effective as the venomous Hargensen. Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell and Ansel Elgort as Tommy Ross also make their well-meaning characters believable. Judy Greer as Miss Desjardin provides another strong performance. Greer's scenes with Moretz are some of my favorite in the film. It's too bad that some people are criticizing this adaptation of Carrie because they think it's not as good as the 1976 film. Sure, the 1976 adaptation is one of the must-see films of the 1970s. I have to admit that on first viewing I didn't think that Peirce's effort was something special. However on second viewing I noticed Peirce's tactics, I noticed how good the performances are, and I noticed how effective many scenes are. So I liked this film even more the second time. It measures up well. I recommend it.Visit http://www.findcarrie.com/",Carrie
90,natashabowiepinky,Carrie... the MODERN version.,7,24 November 2014,"Pity poor Carrie White. At school, she is bullied and derided by her peers for her quiet nature and 'not fitting in'. Her home life consists of listening to the rantings of her religious nutjob of a mother, who forces her to pray in a tiny closet. Things come to a head when, for the TERRIBLE crime of having her first period after gym, she's pelted with sanitary towels while naked in the girl's showers, before having the offending footage uploaded to the Internet. This awakens in her a secret power called Telekinesis... In other words, she can control things with her mind. The people who make her life hell better watch out... Prom night in a-coming... And revenge is definitely on the agenda...Yup, it's a remake (or a 're-imagining' as pretentious producers would say) of Carrie circa 1978... Which was one of my favourite films EVER. I don't think I've ever felt such empathy with a character as I did with Sissy Spacek in that version, and the brilliant direction and pacing was just the icing on the cake. So, how does this one compare? Not too bad, surprisingly. I wasn't expecting cinematic brilliance on a par with the first Carrie... and that's indeed what I got. But Chloe Grace Moretz (So good in Let Me In and the Kick Ass movies) is a more than passable substitute for Spacek, and although the plot closely follows the path set out by the original, there's enough modern trimmings thrown in to keeps things fresh. There's also a new addition to the ending, which some people may find intrusive and unnecessary. I was neutral.. I don't think it improved the finale in any way, but it was a novel idea I guess.Quite impressive. 7/10",Carrie
91,aesgaard41,Updated But Less Scary,7,23 October 2016,"There are a certain number of rules to making a remake, but at the top, the first one should be ""Stay faithful, but try to be new."" In other words, you should try to attract your target audience while also creating a surprise that they won't expect. While ""Carrie"" is somewhat more faithful to the book than the Brian De Palma book, it has also been updated with the technology and the teenage arrogance of the time. The cast is excellent. Chloe Moretz is a much more liberated Carrie who understands the nature of her abilities and seeks to control them while Julianne Moore as her mother creates a much more unstable and psychotic character. Best known for a string of demented characters, namely Kitty Sanchez from ""Arrested Development,"" Judy Greer is a welcome presence in the role of the sympathetic gym teacher, proving she can do a serious role, but I find the story just a bit too familiar with no new scares and not much new except the contemporary setting. The updated Chloe Moretz ""Carrie"" becomes more in tune with her powers, even having an ""X- Men"" moment with witchcraft overtones, whereas in the Sissy Spacek movie, you had the sense she never really understood what was going on around her. The teenage cruelty has no bounds; there's no ""Zero Tolerance"" rule in this reality. Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen is more of a would-be serial killer and career criminal in training than the spoiled brat Nancy Allen portrayed while Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell has more to do than what Amy Irving did in the role. My faults with the movie has nothing to do with the actors, script or plot but more with production. Did we really need seven to eight shots of one bucket of blood dumping its contents?? I mean, did it just magically keep filling itself up? What's with the stalling in the movie's pivotal scenes. The tombstone graffiti and tag scenes make no sense whatsoever not assigned to a dream sequence. It's not truly a scary movie; it's more of an atmospheric film with tragedy replacing horror. De Palma's version was a slow-plodding style that reached a terrifying crescendo while this version creates a terrifying situation that ascends to less than horrific levels. While Spacek gave us a sympathetic Carrie, Moretz creates a more adjusted version. Not terribly scary, just tragic.",Carrie
92,allanmichael30,Bratty,4,22 August 2019,"This remake is a poor representation of the original, why remake it. It seemed more like a high school shooting in terms of impact. This film added little to story with a few negative changes.",Carrie
93,abisio,Not even close to the book and not even half good as the original,3,5 January 2014,The only reason this movie gets three points is because of Julanne Moore who is the best performance in the movie by far. Whenever she is on screen the movie becomes terrifying; but sadly she is only for a few scenes. Moretz on the other hand is a convincing as Carrie but never close to Spacek in the original. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The climax of the movie is poorly staged with cheap digital effects and tamed down. Carrie only kills a few people and lets many to live which does not make any sense for a person totally out of control (was Pierce trying to justify some killings because of vengeance but not the massacre of the book ?). However my major disappointment was the assertion that this is movie is closer to the book than the first one which is an absolute lie. It is obvious Mrs Pierce never read the book; but she saw De Palma version (something she denied) or at least got a copy of his script. The final scary scene was never part of the book and a very very similar one is staged here but completely wrong and ridicule. The Stephen King book was short; but only half was used for the movies. Carrie's mother and father story could have been very interesting from the point of view of a female director like Pierce; but she obviously was more interesting in selling the movie than doing something worth.In brief avoid this movie and future Pierce's work. A good girl is not supposed to lie like she did.,Carrie
94,AngelHonesty,Another Remake,5,17 April 2021,"Why make a mother remake of this film? The first one was perfect. I feel like if you are going to remake the movie, then it should have been done with more creativity. Instead of following the first film extremely close, the movie should have showed more about Carries past, how her mom became the way she was and more of Carries childhood and the struggles. The first film was very cut and dry with what it showed, but I find ever remake does the exact same thing. The biggest difference with this film compared to the others, is that they implemented more of Carries power and made her more aware of it.Carrie (2013), as a stand alone movie with no comparison. I loved the cast, it was a nice mix of known actresses. The filming was great. And the story was smooth, but I felt there was almost too big of a jump with carries development. She went from beyond shy (talk to no one), to suddenly the most confident and beautiful girl in the school in about the span of one week. She was the most sweetest girl, too suddenly a dark creature that loved hurting people. I felt there wasn't enough in the movie, it was too short and ended quickly. It needed a little more to it to make it something more impressive.",Carrie
95,bryank-04844,"This isn't the worst remake, but it isn't stellar either. There's room for a sequel too, but I doubt we'll get to that point.",4,22 August 2015,"'Carrie' was Stephen King's first novel published to the masses, and it made him a writing sensation. In dealing with remakes, it's difficult not to compare to previous versions, as we have the same story arc and characters. In this case with Kimberly Peirce's take on King's novel, nothing seems too different from Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation other than a setting in the present day with mobile phones and computers, and a few other minor updates. Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz turn in great performances to give this reboot a bit of flair, but the overall pace and execution of some of the key scenes feels vague and lazy.Moore plays Margaret White, a religious fanatic who abuses herself by throwing her head into a wall or cutting herself with sharp objects. In the first scene of the film, she has a beautiful baby girl that she almost kills with a large pair of scissors, but changes her mind at the last second. Flash-forward, and Margaret's now-teenaged daughter Carrie (Moretz) attends public high school. A lot of the film plays out like a typical high school drama with cute jocks, mean girls and the lonely outcast who has no friends (in this case, that's Carrie). But little does everyone know that Carrie has a special power that she's developing and discovering.The rest of the story plays out as earlier versions have, with tampon-throwing, pig's blood, and a horrible prom that results in a lot of people's deaths when Carrie unleashes her telekinetic powers.The best parts of the film occur when Moretz and Moore share screen time together. Their mother/daughter relationship is terrifying and creepy. While Carrie begs her psychotic mother to let her experience regular relationships and interactions, Margaret is verbally abusive and not above locking Carrie in a small closet to read the entire Bible at the drop of a hat. Moore pulls this wreck of a woman off perfectly in a very haunting performance. Moretz has a lot to play with here too, as she gets to toy with being a regular teenage girl and going to prom, but also unleashing her dark side where she can kill people with the flick of a finger.Some of the key scenes feel anti-climactic and go by too fast. I expected a grand and epic scene with the iconic bucket of blood, but I felt unsatisfied as the film rushed us off to the next part of the story. The visual effects are solid, and it appears that a bit of practical blood was used rather than silly-looking CG blood, which is a nice touch. The villains are over-the-top evil and make us want to see Carrie get her sweet revenge unharmed.This isn't the worst remake, but it isn't stellar either. There's room for a sequel too, but I doubt we'll get to that point.",Carrie
96,petarmatic,Solid remake!,6,12 February 2014,"I do not like horrors that much, but this one I liked, it is a solid remake of the original Carrie.Visual effects are fabulous and plot is solid.If you have nothing better to do and like horrors this is a film for you. Otherwise you can freely rest and not watch it.It is still amazing for me that Hollywood is so capable in doing visual effects so well.That face thru the glass is a something to remember from this film.Otherwise you can stay and sleep.If you can sleep after a horror movie.",Carrie
97,Geeky Randy,Lacks the buildup and payoff,6,27 October 2014,"Another adaptation of Stephen King's first novel (though actually more of a remake of the 1976 film), updated to accommodate those who don't know (or don't remember) a world without cellphones or CGI—but otherwise a pointless reimagining. The characters actually all have a decent amount of substance to them (at least more so than many other horror movies), but Moretz just isn't convincing as an outcast. The film is no doubt a very enjoyable horror outing, but it seems to get up and running a little too quickly, which robs the movie of the buildup and payoff that the De Palma version had.**½ (out of four)",Carrie
98,ersinkdotcom,'Carrie' remake underwhelming in the shadow of De Palma's original,5,13 January 2014,"Unlike many people, I have no problems with remakes of classic films. Who's to say that someone else's take on a character or universe wouldn't offer something new to the cinematic world? I actually enjoyed the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and ""Fright Night"" reboots. The upcoming ""Robocop"" looks to be entertaining as well.I especially don't mind alternate versions of movies when they were originally based on a novel. Many times, one screenwriter or director's interpretations of a book can be vastly different from another's. Just look at the difference between the two ""Total Recall,"" ""The Shining,"" and ""Salem's Lot"" movies and mini-series. Many have said one follows the author's writings much better than the other. Unfortunately, that doesn't always mean we get a better movie just because it's more faithful. That's the case with Director Kimberly Peirce's vision of ""Carrie.""Carrie's (Chloe Grace Moretz) life can only be described as miserable and lonely. An outcast in school, she finds no solace at home. Her overbearing mother (Julianne Moore) is a misled and overzealous religious nut that constantly condemns Carrie and everyone around her for the sins they have and will commit. When the young girl finds she possesses telekinetic powers, it opens up a whole new world to her. It won't be long before both her psychotic mother and bullying classmates will regret everything they've ever said and done to Carrie.Several things are wrong with ""Carrie."" First off, it's very hard to buy Chloe Grace Moretz as a ""Plain Jane"" girl who is the blight of the school and the outcast everyone picks on. She's too cute to be playing this kind of character. That's not to say she didn't do her best in the role. I just think she was miscast.Secondly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a made-for-TV movie through much of ""Carrie."" The camera-work and overall look reminded me of something I'd see on Lifetime. It's passable, but doesn't give the movie the cinematic feel it should have.2013's ""Carrie"" does take viewers in a couple different directions that weren't explored in Brian De Palma's version of the story. However, that doesn't necessarily translate into being a good thing. Moretz's portrayal of Carrie doesn't leave the audience with the sense of empathy Sissy Spacek's did in the first adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller.The title character's telekinetic powers are much more fantastical in the new ""Carrie."" Instead of just being able to move things with her mind, she can also stop cars in their tracks, fly, and cause the ground to split open. Whether more accurate to the book or not, these powers feel like a bit much and don't hold up well on film.Finally, some of the special effects and CGI were less than spectacular. My biggest complaint is that the explosions suffered from looking a bit too artificial. More time in the image editing process could have cleaned these issues up.The real diamond in the rough when it comes to ""Carrie"" is Julianne Moore. Her portrayal of Margaret White is absolutely wonderful and disturbing. She perfectly captures the desperation and lunacy the character bounces through with complete sincerity.""Carrie"" is rated R for bloody violence, disturbing images, language, and some sexual content. It's definitely gory enough for a restricted rating. There's one scene where two teens are having sex that was unnecessary. They didn't show any nudity, but it was still too much. If it weren't for that scene, this could easily have been rated PG-13.I really respected the way Bible-based Christianity isn't thrown under the bus in 2013's ""Carrie."" As the mother is spouting off religious banter, Carrie points out that what the mother is reciting isn't even found in the Bible. This gives viewers a clearer picture that Margaret isn't practicing traditional living through scripture. Her beliefs are more cult-like and not limited to true Biblical teachings.2013's ""Carrie"" isn't going to please people who loved Brian De Palma's version. It might be more accurate to Stephen King's written word, but it lacks the tension and emotion of the 1976 film. However, it will appeal to those who never saw the first screen adaptation of the book and teenagers will find it easy to relate to. It's safe to say they'll definitely think twice before bullying someone in the future after watching this.",Carrie
99,MattyGibbs,Very enjoyable remake.,8,2 November 2014,The original 'Carrie' is one of my favourite films however it was made 40 years ago so I don't really see why it shouldn't be remade for today's audience. If you don't think it should have been remade then don't watch it.The story is very similar to the original but with a few small alterations which I think benefited the film. The production values are higher than the original and it shows with some excellent special effects and a bit more gore. The casting is good and the acting was of a good standard. Chloe Grace Moretz was as excellent as usual in a difficult role although maybe not quite as suited to this role as Sissy Spacek. If you have seen the original then you know what will happen but that doesn't mean you still can't enjoy this film. It will I presume be enjoyed more by those who haven't seen the original. For a modern horror this is a very good effort and well worth watching if only for the excellent and bloody Prom finale.,Carrie
100,Shopaholic35,The original is much better.,6,17 November 2014,I was looking really forward to this remake but unfortunately not all old movies translate into modern society. It just didn't really work as society today has progressed so much that many of the situations Carrie found herself in just don't seem plausible. It certainly wasn't the worst movie but it was a little too close to the original. Carrie perhaps needed to be a little more worldly. You don't need to be naive to feel scorned and seek revenge.I was very impressed with Julianne Moore's portrayal as the deeply religious mother. She did such a good job and put everything into the role. Chloe Moretz also did a really good job with the material she was given. She's a very talented young girl and will get many more opportunities to showcase her talents.My recommendation would be watch the original Carrie with Sissey Spacek instead. You can't beat it and it will always be a brilliant horror classic.,Carrie
101,face-819-933726,Slower than the Seventies.,7,4 January 2014,"I would not say that this movie is too slow, just really slow, to the point of just about the too mark. Yeah the story is well known, and has been done a few times before, but they did do a fair job of changing just enough to make it more contemporary without actually changing the original. This version may be a little more on page with the book actually. Chloë Moretz is the only reason most people will even watch this movie, and if that is the only reason for you then I will warn you they do a really good job of making her look younger than she has in most of her past movies, and she is made down so completely for the first half of the movie that you will actually have to enjoy her very exceptional acting skills rather than just leering. You will be rewarded though if you are just looking to see her act as we have all come to expect there is a near perfect performance given on her part, and the rest of the movie is just dressing to her as both showpiece, and showstopper. I actually Enjoyed the deeper revenge story, and found that all of the beats that you would expect them to hit were. I would only recommend this to someone who is a real King, or Moretz fan, or even someone who has never seen a Carrie, but if you are looking for a good thrill, or some fun scares, you should look somewhere else.",Carrie

103,meydiana-65242,I'd recommended it to watch,10,18 October 2020,"Good adaptation of a legendary novel
I must admit, hearing there was going to be another adaptation of Stephen King's first book I read so long ago and possibly a remake of the 1976 movie that I thought was a good adaptation, I was a bit cynical. But after hearing Chloë Grace Moretz would portray Carry White and Julianne Moore her mother, I was getting more intrigued and curious about this.It's a story about bullying and what it can do the the victim. That topic is of all times. You soon realize the horror of the story is not Carrie (who has a telekinetic power that quickly develops) but the people around her, like her bible crazed mother and her evil classmate who is willing to do anything to make Carrie pay for being different.Julianne Moore plays an extremely traumatized woman. Every thought that she has that seems sinful must be punished by hurting herself. Julianne Moore is very scary in this role because you never know what she will do next. And you are waiting for her to snap. The rules of life she learned (herself) from the bible and her love for her daughter makes her confused. She portraits this really well, you feel sorry for her and understand her motives to do what she does. Chloë Moretz plays a perfect sweet naive Carrie that doesn't know what is happening to her, but during the story blooms into a more secure young woman. In the beginning of the movie she still tries to hide her head between her shoulders, but as she learns more about life outside her mother's views, she dares to show herself more and shake off the trauma of her mother. I think she is a perfect Carrie, because she keeps her innocence, even when she goes all judgment day on the prom guests. She is still the victim of the people around her.I think they did a good job with this story. I cannot say it's better than the original was in its time, but for this generation of filmmakers and moviegoers, I think this will make quite a big impression on the audience. So for me it's a great adaptation of a legendary novel.",Carrie
104,dfa120374,Just As Enjoyable As The Original,6,16 January 2015,"Carrie White is regarded as a loser; a loner; an outcast. She is also unfortunately the daughter of an obsessively religious & overbearing mother. She also possesses the ability of telekinesis, and when Carrie gets upset or angry things around her tend to break, smash or get damaged, so when some vicious school bullies cross the line with their ""fun"", Carrie can't help but get a little angry. This causes Carrie to unleash her full fury at anyone who gets in her way.This remake is actually an enjoyable film and sticks quite close to the original. There are obviously parts in it where it's more beefed out and there's more action, the main parts being the Prom scenes, but I think this adds to the overall feel of the movie. I always thought the Prom night scenes in the original didn't show the full anger of Carrie and went by a bit too quick. In this version, though, it shows her unleashing her full hell so to speak.Filmmakers can obviously achieve a certain level of effects now that they couldn't way back in 1976, and this is evident with some of the impressive effects here. It's not an effects-laden extravaganza and quite rightly it shouldn't be as Carrie is story-pushed rather than effects-pushed, but some of the effects in the movie are well done and pretty cool to watch.Chloë Grace Moretz does a really good job of playing Carrie bringing her own believability to the character, and Julianne Moore performs equally as good as Margaret White, Carrie's mother. The members who played the bullies - especially Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen - were also believable in their parts, and when it came to their time I had absolutely no sympathy. I know it's only a movie, but being a victim of school bullying myself, I cheered inside when they really got what they deserved.This is a good film adaptation remake of a classic King novel and one I'd recommend watching.",Carrie
105,cinematic_aficionado,Carrie for the 21st century,6,2 December 2013,"A horror classic gets the contemporary Hollywood treatment.An introverted girl, raised by a religiously evil mother, is the target of her classmates' scorn. She is not like the other girls. Her mother oppresses her, the girls at school ridicule her. She is cornered, with no one to defend her. Well, almost no one. A gym teacher is always ready to stand by her aside but ultimately the discovery of an ability to move things by thought soon becomes a potent defended mechanism, something which will provide the climax of this film.This version of Carrie, is undoubtedly for the new generation. Smartphone shooting and video uploading make it for a truly adjusted version. Modern horror also meant for an overload of sensationalism. CGI took centre stage, depriving it of the original's awe factor.Engaging and at times impressive, but still not in the original's league.",Carrie
106,billygoat1071,Reminiscence The Camp,7,17 October 2013,"To be honest, the 1976 version of Carrie was only great for that period. It's not hard to see how the audience reacted to the film back in the days, but now it's nothing more than an entertaining campy relic. The only thing that many would still be amazed is its iconic prom scene. Another adaptation could be a great idea, especially for this generation when the context of the story has become more relevant. Unfortunately, it seems everyone behind this new version can't let go of the past and the ambition leans more on recapturing the best moments of the original. However, solid filmmaking and great cast makes the film watchable. It's almost like the same movie, but with people using modern technology and CGI death scenes. But the rest, it's difficult to know what else is the difference.While fans will always defend the De Palma version, a remake is reasonable. Bullying has become a serious subject, and sometimes the bullied fights back ending up doing something worse. Those real life incidents resembles so much in this classic story, but the film wasn't so focused at that point until the end. Although we get to see more of Carrie being curious about her special abilities and Margaret's briefest backstories, which are interesting addition to the plot, that didn't make up enough to show its bigger picture. Again, the movie is more fond to its campiness. It at least gives a bit of satisfaction to those who crave for horror violence. The famous prom scene has found some inventive ways to kill its characters, despite of CGI.The direction has its own style which works throughout. If there's anything else elevated, then that's most likely the performances. From the original, most of the cast (aside of Sissy Spacek) were probably too broad and sort of hammed it up. It's from the 70's, sure, but then we need a more credible and darker depiction of high school. Chloe Grace Moretz gives a genuine intimidation and eventual natural madness to the character. Julianne Moore is the improvement among. She manifests the pain beneath Margaret White's fanaticism, which is quite compelling.The best advice to see Carrie is to not be familiar with the other adaptations, because the existence of those kind of affected the surprises, though I wished the film stepped forward more on its message to make it feel distinct than the camp that made this story such an icon. Overall, it's neither inferior nor superior compared to the original; it's all straightforward remake with modern time elements. Despite of being disappointing, Carrie is still an entertaining film. It's a great story anyway, and giving it a second look with a different vision might be alright. In the end, it's a needless re-adaptation than we thought it would be.",Carrie
107,RevRonster,Very similar to the classic but not too bad...,8,16 January 2014,"Remakes get a bad rap in our internet-crazed society and ALWAYS illicit knee-jerk reactions and people screaming, ""Hollywood has run out of ideas,"" but I always see them as an opportunity for new audiences to see the stories that have captivated older generations with their films.For the most part, ""Carrie"" doesn't change much of what we saw in the 1976 classic but I did enjoy how they incorporated a subplot that was basically only hinted at in the books to this adaptation. Combine this with a new cast, the film has a familiar but refreshing appearance. While this may be grating to some viewers and make the concept of remaking ""Carrie"" a tad superfluous, I enjoyed this aspect. The only thing I enjoyed more was Julianne Moore.Moore was just unbelievable as Margaret White. While Chloë Grace Moretz really did an amazing job as the troubled telekinetic youth and was addicting to watch when she became a walking rage monster during the prom fiasco, Moore really became a show stealer as Mama White and took the character to new, more unhinged levels than I saw in Piper Laurie.With great performances, a story that doesn't change much from what we already are familiar with and greater advancements in special effects that help create better visuals and more satisfying carnage, ""Carrie"" is a decent and very entertaining film that does justice to the one that came before it (the 1976 filmnot the made-for-TV remake from 2002).Hi!

I love Chloe Grace Moretz in about everything she does, even mediocre movies, i think she manage to shine, and again she put on a good performance. The issue is she is harder to believe in a socially awkward teenager. I mean, she is beautifull, and you would have a hard time believing she was seen as what the role demand. So altough she did as best as she could with the role, i just feel she was kinda miscasted.Maybe it also has to do with the period the original movie and novel were made, with internet and social medias etc these days i find it harder to buy that a mother like Carrie's would still manage to pull off what she did. Speaking of social medias, altough they do play a role, i feel its not big enough.Anyway ultimately if you enjoyed the Original movie, you should enjoy this one, but it won't really bring anything more to you. I guess this was made as an alternative for a new generation with a recognizable face in the role.If they ever remake it again, i hope they go crazy with it and have fun and go further from the original novel, cause after 3 movies and a pseudo-sequel, we know this tale.",Carrie

110,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,They'll All Laugh At... What Exactly?,2,20 October 2013,"Take away the telekinetic powers, the hyper-religious mother and a bucket of pig's blood on the noggin, the original CARRIE, a suspenseful Stephen King adaptation directed by Brian De Palma, is really about a high school girl who doesn't fit in. That fact is obvious just by looking at Sissy Spacek's Carrie White, who seems as though she's never belonged to any campus clique judging by her distant, dazed expression.While Spacek was a natural beauty in earlier films like BADLANDS and PRIME CUT, she was turned into a homely outcast But Chloë Grace Moretz doesn't have any problem whatsoever: Lose the permanent scowl and she's cuter than most of the girls, even the popular bullies So it doesn't quite work when sympathetic Sue Snell, played by an elfin Gabriella Wilde, talks boyfriend Tommy Ross into escorting Carrie to the prom. Sappy scenes bordering on awkward TWILIGHT romance gives the impression he's one lucky guy with two lovely girlfriends But Carrie has a load of trouble at home in the form of crazy mom Margaret White....Without further comparing this to the original, Julianne Moore, filling the famous Piper Laurie role, tries her over-the-top best with spooky long hair and an icy disposition, but acts more like a kooky soccer mom in dire need of xanax than the main ingredient for her daughter's deep rooted problemsEnter Carrie's freewheeling use of telekinesis Her ability to easily manipulate elements, like a young Jedi or a Hogwarts pupil, makes you forget she's a troubled girl who can't control ominous powers. In one scene, as her schoolbooks float jovially around the bedroom, you'd think she discovered a quick way of finishing chores or perhaps a time-filling substitute for not having a Facebook or Twitter account. And then, once we arrive at the inevitable doomsday prom, when Carrie goes to town with hellishly lethal vengeance, you'll wonder if this entire remake occurred just to witness a group of young people being slaughtered care-of computer-generated effects...If that's the case, the maligned 90's sequel THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 covered this unnecessary ground already.",Carrie
111,richieandsam,"It was OK, but a complete waste of time and money.",6,9 April 2014,"CARRIEThere are good things to say about this film but also some negative.This is a remake of a classic 70s horror film based on a novel by Stephen King. Carrie White is a lonely girl who gets bullied quite a lot in school. She realizes she has telekinesis powers and learns to use them to her advantage. She has been brought up with a very strict, religious mother who punishes her regularly. Everything builds up inside Carrie until she snaps and goes on a rampage full of revenge.The story is classic. I have read the book and seen the original movie. They are both really good... but did it need a remake? No!What exactly does remaking this film do? Nothing. The only thing that I can say was better in this version was the effects. The effects we have now compared to the 70s are clearly a lot better... but I felt that the original movie was brilliant the way it was. The effects it had were brilliant for it's time and we didn't need them to be better.One good thing about this movie is the casting. I thought the cast were pretty good. I am not a Chloe Grace Moretz fan. I find her acting annoying and I feel that she can't seem to feed a line well... but not in this. I thought Chloe was very good in this most of the time. In fact there was only one time where I thought she delivered a line badly... and that was near the end of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance in this. Chloe played a great Carrie, but she was not Sissy Spacek. The rest of the cast though did a great job. Other cast members were Julianne Moore, Gabriella Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Ansel Elgort & Zoe Belkin.The movie was well put together and well shot. I thought it was a very entertaining movie, but I would much rather have watched the original. It felt like this movie was a waste of money making it. That is the problem with remaking a movie... especially a classic one. No matter how good you make the movie, it will always get slated. I don't do it on purpose but remaking a film is such a bad idea. If you remake a film and change anything, you get slated... if you remake a film and don't change anything (like this) you get slated... what is the point?The killings are good and the effects are very good... watch this if you have not seen the original... if you have, then I would bypass this one.I will give this 6 out of 10.""You must renounce this power, you must give it up!

113,p-jonsson,Surprisingly good,7,16 July 2014,"It was a loooong time since I watched the original Carrie movie. I was never a real fan of the original. I thought it took too long to get going and the ending was too tragic. But then, I was rather young when I watched it. Yesterday I sat down and watched the remake.I have to say that I found it surprisingly good. Sure, the actual story of the movie with the poor girl being bullied by these school assholes, or in particular one asshole, cannot be said to be a story that really appeals to me. It is a rather depressing and frustrating story to say the least. It is a movie that, I myself at least, watched for the outbreaks of telekinetic special effects.Having said that, I think that both Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore made commendable performances. Especially Julianne Moore who really made me riled up and squirm from frustration in my seat when she got started with her insane religious nonsense.A remake is of course always at somewhat of a disadvantage in that you already know the general story and thus pretty much know what is going to happen. Thus I liked that they had splattered outbursts of telekinetic powers (= special effects) fairly liberally also in the early parts of the movie. I do not remember that Carrie was showing very much of her powers until the very end in the original. For me this made the movie more interesting to watch as it would have been both boring and frustrating if it had been nothing more than the bullies, and Carrie's crazy mother, harassing Carrie until the very end.The end, well I still think it is a rather sad one. I would have been much happier if Carrie would have gotten her revenge and somehow survived but then, that would have been too much of not-following-the-book instead so I guess I have to live with the depressing ending.On the whole I am positively surprised by the movie. It is a remake that adds modern flavor and special effects without destroying the general look and feel of the original.",Carrie
114,DavidYZ,A good remake,7,17 April 2017,"Chloe Grace Moretz isn't as good an actress as Sissy Spacek. Most of the acting by the supporting cast is inferior to that of their counterparts in the original. This isn't as good as the original film, but it's better than most remakes.There are some ways in which this is an improvement on the original. Julianne Moore is excellent, playing the protagonist's mother. They corrected the volleyball scene by having it played in the swimming pool - as opposed to (dangerously) on concrete in the original. They removed the ridiculous line towards the end of the original when Sue's mother said that Sue was so young that she'd forget about the events at prom.",Carrie

⚪
All in all, the modern adaption of King's hit novel might have manage to capture the essence of the twenty first century and adapt to its standards, but other than that, it didn't really succeed to make use of its technologies, in fact, it's almost a scene by scene recreation of the original film rather than a reimagining, only that this one is far inferior in almost every case, especially when it comes to the actors, thus making it only an uninspired, unnecessary rehash of a classic film, only a bloody handprint on a white blouse, instead of the bucket full of blood it could have been.
⚪
After having watched the seventies version of Kings classic supernatural high school nightmare, I thought it was the best opportunity to give the heavily criticised remake a watch, while the images of the brilliant original are still in my mind. I am still not sure if that was kind of a mistake, but isn't it the most reasonable consequence to directly compare those two versions, considering that they are based on the same source material? Anyway, I think that this film here was inferior to De Palma's opus in almost every way. What is wrong with this film, though? Well, two words: the cast. The version from seventy-six lived from the powerhouse performances of Spacek and Laurie, as Carrie and Margret White, respectively, and the haunting chemistry between those two. Let me put it this way: What Moretz and Moore had was nowhere near that, in fact, I even think that they were totally out of place in their roles. I don't want to say that they are not talented, quite contrary, both are actress I highly enjoy seeing in other films, but they simply weren't right to follow in the footsteps of Spacek and Laurie. While Moore is tolerable, yet not quite as discomforting as she could have been, Chloë Grace Moretz is probably the worst casting choice in this entire movie. It might be that it is only my personal point of view, but CGM is way too gorgeous to be playing Carrie White, a character described as cute but not appealing, and hence didn't buy from her to be an outcast that is bullied for her looks and appearances. Regardless of her looks, though, she also really didn't manage to embody the tortured, complex personality that Carrie is. Spacek famously nailed that with her eye game, among other factors, Moretz however didn't do anything that is as remarkable as this, and when the film's title is literally the name of the character all success depends on, you need to have the perfect casting, otherwise you will end up failing. Well, aside from the crucial casting aspect, the film furthermore didn't do anything to justify its existence either. When adapting from a source material, you still have a lot of artistic freedom and plenty of possibilities to do something on your own. What I am trying to say is, what is the point of remaking the first adaptation instead of reimagining the novel? Of course, it accomplished to relocate the story in the twenty-first century by, for instance, including cyber bullying and the danger of modern technologies, but other than that, it sticked way too close to the original. To say nothing of copied lines of dialogue (which certainly originate from the novel), it is still not the point of a remake to exactly reenact the whole movie with obviously less capable actors. Well, the only ones I genuinely liked in their roles were Judy Greer as Ms. Desjardin and Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen, who still didn't reach the level of the respective actors from the original. Oh, and then there is Ansel Elgort as Tommy Ross. Once again, I loved him in as Baby in ""Baby Driver"", but here? Felt so extremely weird, to be honest. In addition to that, the film simply lacked every factor I absolutely adored in case of the original: the empathetic cinematography, the effective editing, the fitting score and the overall build up. In this case, it felt totally bleak and was nothing but bland to me. The only new thing that they included was that Carrie was more aware of her powers and tested them more elaborately, hence I thought that this would be a benefit for the infamous prom scene and that she would controlledly raise hell instead of giving way to her blind rage. To be honest, I am both disappointed and impressed by how they handled said prom scene. On one hand, I thought it was great how she consciously tortured only those who have done her wrong in the past and concentrated on paying them back, on the other hand, I thought it could have been more bloody and gory, as the modern technologies theoretically bare endless possibilities. Also, one of the most horrifying aspects of this total annihilation in the original was that she eliminated every single one who was present, her mentor and friend Ms. Desjardin included. That is why I both hate it and love it, as I like the selected revenge campaign but missed the blood fest and brutality. Oh, and don't get me started about that terrible, terrible CGI. In the end, this film didn't add anything new and didn't do anything to justify its existence. Poor casting choices and direction keep it from being relevant, and this film only proves that you should not fix what is not broken.",Carrie

Carrie (2013) is a beautiful surprise, with a formidable cast and remarkable performances. Congratulations and thank you to all the cast and crew who achieved such a wonderful work: Chloë Grace Moretz is just as cute and fragile as Sissy Spacek was, and her sensitive and insightful portrayal of this unwanted and bullied high-school girl from an abusive religious house is so powerful that we instinctively feel like protecting her from the evil that small-minded ordinary people do, and Julianne Moore excels in the role of Margaret White - Carrie's mother.Directed by a woman - Kimberly Peirce - it is the third time that Stephen King's 1974 novel of the same name has come to life on the big screen, much to our delight.9.5/10",Carrie
118,doug_park2001,"""Mama told me not to come!"" (Three Dog Night)",8,23 March 2014,"Remakes can never quite do justice to ""originals"" for the simple reason that they are unoriginal. Though it's been a number of years since I read Stephen King's novel and saw the 1976 film version, from what I can tell, CARRIE (2013) follows the original storyline quite closely, enhancing it with smartphone photos of the infamous tampon-throwing scene and a brief episode of cyber-bullying. It's generally well-filmed, and the acting ranges from tepid to pretty good, with Julianne Moore giving an impressive performance as Carrie's mom. Without any fundamental changes to the roles they play, Carrie's fanatical mother and certain schoolmates come off as just a little more human than they did in '76. This version also gives a convincing portrayal of a contemporary high school, which is never an easy thing to do. Certain other aspects such as the English class poetry reading are skipped through quickly and cursorily, and anyone who's unfamiliar with the basic story may be left wondering how these scenes are supposed to fit into the whole. In short, it's in some ways better, in other ways worse, than CARRIE (1976).It would have been a risk, and fans of the book and ""original"" film would not have liked it, but, even if meant departing from what's in the novel, I think this version would have been better-still with more modernized details and small but significantly different twists. Though quite good, CARRIE (2013) comes off a bit too much as an update for the sake of an update.At any rate, horror fans who have never read the novel or seen CARRIE (1976) will probably find CARRIE (2013) satisfyingly unpredictable if not a little confusing.",Carrie
119,TheMarwood,A long way down for Kimberly Peirce,3,10 June 2014,"The talented Kimberly Peirce makes her first director for hire gig with this slapdash horror flick that feels more like a byproduct of a studio than a film from a strong director. The cast is full of bland pretty faces and an awful performance by Julianne Moore and miscast Chloë Grace Moretz. When Moretz is using her telekinetic powers, her facial movements look less like acting decisions and more the result of severe constipation. Visually the film looks like it belongs on network television, it's over lit, flat and doesn't feel like big screen material. This updated version of the Stephen King story also feels slightly sanitized. Sure, there is some blood, but nobody feels committed to this material like in the earlier DePalma film. Moretz just looks like her usual self with typical film make-up, playing a socially awkward teen - but she never falls comfortably into the role and it feels forced and phony and she never gets near the fearless performance that Sissy Spacek gave as the title character in the '76 version. Kimberly Peirce never pushes the story into the dark recesses of budding sexuality and torment and the buildup to a grisly finale seems half assed and afraid to take any chances.",Carrie

This quick cash grabber is nowhere near as finely polished as the original, leaving a rather bitter taste in your mouth afterwards. The casting for Carrie seemed like a poor choice as the lead actress is far to beautiful, no offense to Sissy, and on top of that the acting seems forced. No one was asking for a remake of this fine classic, but we got one anyway, which is pure rubbish. What it does do, however, is make you want to watch the original just so you don't feel as if it was rubbish too. Some may enjoy the more modern update to Carrie, whilst fans of the original will find it dull and unnecessary. Very poor in its approach and casting and also very unoriginal in its story make up.

Yes, it followed the general horror movie roadmap to give you the bang at the end of the film. But I was interested in the relationship with her mother, the development of the bad girl's plan, the good couple's plan and her coming-of-age vs. the powers she has along the way.And, of course, the indulgence of having all the bullies meet their fate.

123,elliotte2,Closer to the Original Book,7,17 February 2014,"First of all...for all the people that have given this negative reviews....those are the same people who know nothing about the book. Generally those people would have hated the movie regardless.It is always very hard and generally pointless to remake cult classic films. You either one, stay completely true to the original with just different actors(which is pointless), or you change it and people fuss about how you messed up the original. I loved Shining, but a few things in it did not make sense...the Shining done with Stephen Weber 20 years later was actually like the book, and while it didn't have the same 'dark effect' of the original Shining...it actually made more sense.(I will admit, Stephen Weber is nowhere close to Jack Nicholson)This one walked that fine line very well. I'm a Stephen King fan and loved original Carrie, what this movie does is fill in the details that we do not see in the movie(the same details that is in the book).Spoilers Below! 1. Original Carrie, popular girl convinces her popular boyfriend to take Carrie to prom..which in hindsight didn't seen very believable...in this movie we see the girl wrestling with her emotions and we also see the boyfriend as a defender of Carrie even BEFORE he is asked by the girlfriend to take her to prom....the scene is more natural and flows better.2. We never knew why the kids conspired to put pig's blood on Carrie, it took it as just being mean...here we see why and the build up motivation behind it....again the scene is more believable.3. We learn a little bit of why the mother is slightly crazy and now understand her demons(pun intended).I'm a movie buff and watched about 7 DVD's right in a row on a long road trip...a week later the only movie I remember watching was this Carrie(had to look up my history, I watched 21 Guns, Elysian, Millers, Prisoners, Riddick, Ender's Game) and yes...Carrie is the one I remembered without even thinking about it.I enjoyed the movie, it is hard to compare because the movies have very different tones(the darker Shining with Jack Nicholson, and the truer Shining with Stephen Weber).

I still haven't seen the original one, which is why I can't really compare this to the original one, I can only compare it to the novel. And I didn't like the novel.First time seeing Carrie I loved it so much for some reason. But this is the third time and it's losing its charm. There's some really beautiful cinematography in the film, and some amazing lighting, but eventually the story doesn't really stand seeing it several times, or I've grown out of it in the past four years.There's something kind of sweet about some parts of the story, and the rest is just really awful. That's a weird combination, because on the other hand it's this shy girl learning she has powers, but on the other hand there's a really disturbing abusive religious mother and all those students who are horrible to Carrie... I think especially now that I'm older I see better how sad the whole story is.As a movie Carrie doesn't feel like anything great. It's a remake, and of course that affects it a lot.

128,Bruce722,Mediocre at best.,5,23 February 2014,"There are some good things and some bad things about this remake of Carrie, hence the mediocre rating. Let's start with the bad things. First of all, the stereotypes are so absurd and overblown that the film is at times tough to get through due to the ridiculousness of it. Anyone who has been in high school can tell that the stereotype these films portray it to be is very off base. This movie goes further than most with it. Another weak element was the lack of development for the protagonist. The movie hinges on you pitying Carrie and all she goes through and then turning that pity on its head in the closing scenes. Without any substantial development, however, there is a disconnect between the audience and the viewer. This makes the closing scenes more superficial. Speaking of Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz is one of the best young actors in Hollywood but she struggled at times, especially early on. I don't know if that's what the director was shooting for but her introverted behavior didn't feel natural at all. Nonetheless, there were other times when she was incredible, which brings us to the positives in the movie. The acting by most of the cast was very good and Julianne Moore was brilliant. She stole the movie, in my opinion. One of the best things about the movie, funny enough, is the alternate ending. I'm not sure why they didn't use that one but wow, it is so much better than the theatrical one. I'd suggest anyone watching this movie to watch that version.",Carrie
129,DustinRahksi,Why is there a 5 year old in the theatre.,6,20 October 2013,"So I'm guessing this was remade because the of the surge of teen bullying that is going on in the news, so they thought it was time for an update. Too bad they didn't update it one bit huh. You know, they should have remade it, instead of following the original in every way shape and from. This is a pointless film, why was it made. They reuse the same scenes, same dialogue, no matter how goofy and dated it is. What was the deal with them putting that montage in this film, why would they put that in there.The teenagers in this film are so Hollywood, Chris is like the god*amn devil, she is evil incarnate. And the whole prom theme, do the kids even care about that in this day and age, I don't know that's an American thing. And the whole teacher bullying Carrie, is this for real, I have never ever seen a teacher bully or allow bullying to a student. Every single thing in this film is complete garbage, except our two leads. Mortez was very good as Carrie, but the problem with that is, she pretty much just copied Sissy Spacek's performance. She was good, but I have seen it done before, and much better at that. But I still did feel her pain, and felt bad about what happened to her. Her reaction to Tommy dying was much better here, than it was in the original. I never much cared for Mortez before, and never understood why people liked her, but considering this is the first time she has ever given a good performance, I don't have a problem with her anymore. But the one who steals the show is Julianne Moore, she surpasses the original Margret White in my opinion. When she first appeared at the school after the incident, I could just feel her presence. The gym teacher was much weaker in this film, she didn't sit right with me.Overall, the film is very disappointing, they had a huge opportunity to update this properly to fit with modern society. But no, it plays out as if it were still in the 70's. It has it's high and lows, but it was enjoyable. But the reality is, you could just stay at home and the original, or the tormented, or anything about this subject matter for dirt cheap.",Carrie
130,LanceBrave,Hit-Girl Wouldn't Put Up With This!,6,5 November 2013,"I can understand the desire to remake ""Carrie."" The story is iconic. Moreover, every generation of high school students have to deal with bullying. There's a Carrie White in every high school in the world. Perhaps each generation deserves their own version of ""Carrie."" At the same time, is revisiting a story this well-known for the fourth time necessary? Is there any chance of the 2013 version of ""Carrie"" dethroning the 1976 take as the definitive vision? Director Kimberly Peirce maintains the original structure as much as possible. Carrie White: social pariah, crazy mom, psychic powers. Period in the shower, school bullies, pity prom date, pig's blood, telekinetic rampage. The differences are minor. The school principal actually remembers Carrie's name. Margaret White has taken up self-mutilation. She cuts her skin in times of stress and clearly derives masochistic pleasure from it. Modern CGI-effects allows Carrie's powers to be more realized. She melts deadbolts, whips electric wires, and floats over the burning gymnasium. The screenplay attempts to modern-up the story for today's kids. Carrie's shower room break-down is recorded on a cell phone and posted to the internet. Carrie looks up videos of telekinesis on YouTube. Characters text each other a few times. Few of these elements have any effect on the plot. Otherwise, the tale remains the same.Many critics have bemoaned that Chloe Moretz is miscast. On paper, it seems like sound casting. Moretz is talented and has played sheltered, disturbed, violent young women before. Ultimately, Carrie is a rough fit for Chloe's usual acting style. Her Carrie is always too strong. She never comes off like a victim. Her interaction with her mother is too willful. This Carrie has not been wrecked by years of systematic abuse. She masters her powers too quickly and seems too willing to use them. You honestly wonder why she doesn't just run away from home. Hit-Girl wouldn't put up with this. On a far more nitpicking level, I dislike Chloe controlling her powers with her hands. Purely ascetically, I think it looks goofy.A lot of people have been harping on Chloe because she's too pretty to play Carrie. She is. Everyone in this movie is too pretty. Every single girl that attends the high school is a rail-thin supermodel. Every single guy has a six-pack and handsome stubble. There are two fat kids in the entire film. I know, I counted. Despite ostensibly being set in Maine, the décor of the surrounding homes scream modern-day Los Angeles. Everything is too slick, too polished. This extends to the CGI effects, which are overused and overdone. Carrie flying above the ground or lifting cars in the air is too much for me. This is just how it is with modern studio horror films. Hollywood doesn't realize there's a world outside of L.A., where everyone is beautiful and has perfect smiles.It's not that 2013's ""Carrie"" is bad, per say. The character might not be her type but Moretz still gives a very good performance. Julianne Moore finds a suitable middle ground between Piper Laurie's overdone theatrics and Patricia Clarkson's subtle method acting. Her Margaret is still a crazy Jesus-freak, damning the world and her own daughter, but she's at least believable as a human being. Gabriella Widle and Ansel Elgort are serviceable as Sue and Tommy while Porita Doubleday as Chris Hargensen is so completely entitled, you really can't wait to see her killed. The film makes time for quiet character moments and I ultimately found Carrie and Tommy's prom night relationship to be fairly charming.Even the prom night massacre isn't bad. The movie doesn't back away from Carrie's cruelty. The effects and gore are well-engineered. Even though some of her victims are assholes, it still establishes that Carrie becomes a monster by wantonly slaughtering innocents. The scene even builds some decent tension, though Marco Beltrami's generic score really makes me miss Pino Dinaggio.The ending falls flat for me. The film tries to establish that, despite the abuse and differences, Carrie and Margaret really do love each other. This manifests itself solely as a few ""I love yous"" and nothing else. The film returns King's device of Sue's pregnancy while largely missing the point. Overall, Sue's final discussion with Carrie is overdone and spells out the film's themes too blatantly. Moretz is least believable when crying over her dead mother. The voice-over-aided final scene similarly spells out the movie's moral. Is 2013's ""Carrie"" a bad movie? No. Is it a good movie? Almost. Do the performances and stylistic changes justify the remake's existence? I can't say it does. Ultimately, this ranks on the same level for me as the 2002 version. Not bad by any means but wholly unnecessary.",Carrie
131,Mike-DD,"Execution could have been better, but story's still good",6,22 March 2014,"This is an updated version where the Internet, social media sites, video streaming and smartphones have a major influence on today's teenagers.They story hasn't changed - girl with religious fanatic mother struggles to be 'normal', gets bullied in school, finally breaks down and kills almost everyone with her telekinetic powers.But the execution has. It could have done better in creating and maintaining suspense, but usually, whatever suspense is created is either quickly extinguished or dragged on too long without new input. The saving grace is in the last act when Carrie finally unleashes her full power.There are details that stretch the story's credibility (beyond what is expected in Carrie). How many teenagers these days still check out library books for a subject like magic powers? How is the mother not more concerned about the seemingly-diabolical powers her daughter seem to possess or attract? Why does a school where there is blatant bullying targeted against one person appear to do nothing, even when there is a damning video posted online? And the transition of Carrie from being scared of her mother to deliberate instant rebellion was too abrupt for my taste.I found the acting to be good for the most part. Chloë Grace Moretz plays the role of a confused and conflicted Carrie well, though at times I wish to see more expressions of the conflict within her. I had hoped that the movie had uglified her more too - she's pretty enough you wonder why she doesn't have any friends or suitors, even among the outcasts at school. Julianne Moore is not entirely convincing as a religious fanatic mother though. She simply does not appear unbalanced enough to me. I thought Sue Snell did a better job as the gym teacher with smarts and a heart. The supporting cast were okay for the most part. I didn't really care for the 'good' ones though. The villainous teens actually had me more emotionally involved.While there isn't much to particularly recommend about this film, the final 20 minutes saves the film from mediocrity.",Carrie
132,lucasnochez,Review: Carrie Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,7,11 November 2013,"Halloween has a very fundamental, ABC rubric in the cinematic film world; A usually stands for absurdity, and the countless absurd efforts to scare people in a genre that defines it's own rules; B is for blood, lots and lots of blood; and C is for Carrie. Hailed as the most popular film to watch on Halloween, Carrie has been in the film world since its first adaptation in 1976, a performance made iconic by Sissy Spacek. Since then, the character has really struggled to find any solid footing in a sequel and a made for television movie. In its third attempt, director Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss) delivers a surprisingly satisfying modern retelling of beloved horror novelist Stephen King's first ever published novel. Serving more as an homage and ode to the novel and classic film, Peirce and company tip their hats and inevitably add small nuanced changes to the story as it appeals to a new generation that can understand the ridicule and embarrassment of traumatic high school pranks with the inclusion of social media and modern technology. Yes, Facebook and smartphones have a lot to do with Carrie's demising high school reputation.Carrie White (the iconic role this time portrayed by Chloë Grace Moretz) is a young, socially handicapped high schooler who just wants a normal life with normal friends. Unfortunately for her, her mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) is a Christian extremist who doesn't allow Carrie to do much, other than attend school and pray. In her last year of high school, weeks before prom, Carrie awkwardly finds herself trickling into the gym showers once all the other girls have finished, and has her first period. Frantic and hysterical, Carrie seeks refuge in her peers, who laugh and throw tampons and sanitary products at her while screaming for help in the showers. What starts off as a stark symbol of womanhood, quickly progresses into a whirlwind of blood and suffering.Unable to share any of her real world issues with her mother, Carrie confides in her school gym teacher Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer) who reassures Carrie, protects her and occasionally slaps her out of it, while Carrie is experimenting with her newly discovered telekinetic abilities. The popular girls, malicious and evil (in a way only high school girls know how to be) led by Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday) make Carrie's life a living hell during their last days in school. As prom nears and the guilt of her actions take a toll on her, one of the only girls with a soul, Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde), moved by pure emotion and empathy, asks her dreamy boyfriend Tommy Ross (played by Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie to the prom. And if you know anything about Carrie and her time at the prom, you can imagine how it all went.Peirce's re-imagining of the classic is actually quite good. With the exception of one heavily- FXed destruction scene near the film's finale and the final frame's of the movie that maybe hints at a sequel, the film has a keen cinematic eye thanks to its talented director. The film itself, for once in a high-profile October release, is not an unexplained marathon of blood, gore and cheap thrills. Instead, Peirce's Carrie is a subtle and nuanced straight horror film with an intent to honour its predecessor.One of the things that Carrie doesn't have going for her is her outdated story and lack of a real 'scary power'. Lets face it, once X-Men was made into a movie and Professor X became the face of telekinesis, a little girl with an unexplained ability to move things with her mind don't really scare people anymore, unless your pranking them.From page to screen, Carrie is bound to be a well oiled, money making machine. What is most impressive about this adaptation of the iconic character is the marketing that both MGM and Screen Gems did to ensure the film is a hit. The studios brought an impressive line-up in front and behind the camera. From Julianne Moore, who nails the self-sacrificing, insane iconic Margaret White character effortlessly, to Moretz, who, has an unexplained terror in her facial expressions to sell the characters to a new generation of horror obsessed audience, the film succeeds at not being an overshadowed relic. Unfortunately for Moretz, Carrie moved objects in the original film with her eyes, not her hands like Moretz did in this adaptation. It is hard for any horror fan to deny that Spacek's eyes in the original Carrie will forever be the eyes and face of the iconic character.Along with the cast, the film adaptation also failed to have any real competition and strategically slotted itself in a Halloween season absent of any 'paranormal activity' or other masked murdering icons. It should easily retain a spot atop the box office until Halloween. Not to mention the ingenious viral campaign the film took to promote the troubled, misunderstood teen.When all is said and done and end credits to the film roll, there is no ignoring that Pierce and company have delivered the most faithful cinematic adaptation to King's novel and equivalent to the 1976 film version. With some artistic narrative liberties being taken to modernize the story, modest effects heart-pounding, jaw-clenching tension, this Carrie adaptation can rest assured that younger audience members may finally know her name, and not the same name their parents know, gross!Night Film Reviews: 7/10 Stars",Carrie
133,CMTiago,An entertaining remake,8,21 October 2014,"I was pleasantly surprised by this 2013 version of Carrie. Since I have not seen the original film, I can't really compare them yet. As a story about a young girl that is ostracized to the point of losing her mind and unleashing destruction upon those who tormented her, I think this movie delivers. Chloe Grace Moretz is at her very best, as she handles the role very well. At first she shows her shy and scared side. Also, as an evil, powerful killer, the intensity is there and I could not ask for more. Given its modern setting, I felt that the adaptation process was well worked, and with the inclusion of technology, the movie's themes expand, giving it another edge. Didn't really expect so much backlash, but if you decide to take it from me, watch Carrie from 2013. You will be throughly entertained.Rating: 8/10",Carrie
134,jtungsten16,Best movie ever!,10,13 October 2014,"what can I say about ""Carrie"" this horror/ thriller will have you on the edge of your seat wondering if Carrie will get her revenge on those horrible girls that made fun of her. Chloe Grace Moretz really portrayed Carrie in a realistic way and Julianne Moore really knocked it out of the park! I loved everything about the movie the acting, the directing, the writing, the music and the fact that I own a lot of the props from the film. Carrie is a remake of the 1976 film of the same title, people said there was no reason that a remake had to be done, but I think the new modern day Carrie had to be done because director Kimberly Peirce really did a great job making it more today and I think every movie needs a remake at least 20 years later to show the next generation what good movies are all about. Watch the new Carrie people it's a great movie!",Carrie
135,chow913,"Carrie's New Power, Sloppy CGI",6,20 September 2015,"IMDb calls this a ""reimagining"" (no such word in dictionary) instead of a ""remake."" That's just plain silly.IMDb also credits Stephen King as the author of the original novel which the actual film credits DO NOT! Actually this is more of a retelling of the classic 1976 'Carrie' scene for scene line for line. ""They're all going to laugh at you!"" Begging the question why do we need a SIXTH (by my count) remake of a film which is already beloved?Because, Carrie needs to unleash her new supernatural power, really sloppy CGI! Worst of all they mix in real fire with bad CGI Playstation fire which of course only highlights how fake the CGI looks! Come on guys. Cavemen had fire. You don't need to CGI it! As negative as I'm being I actually did enjoy this film much more than I expected simply because it stayed about 95% true to the original. That's right, they actually recognized what a great screenplay the original was and stuck with it.The remake also corrects the major major problem which I and many fans had with the original, the slow as sxxx pacing! It was dragged out way to long. The remake gets to the point a whole lot faster. For example, Carrie crashes the boy's bike about 20 minutes in in the remake. While the original took an hour and a half to get there.The 5% change in the screenplay is mostly for the better and some things are spelled out more clearly. For example, the bully Sue Snell clearly does feel remorse for her actions in the beginning and clearly tries to save Carrie from the pig's blood in the climax while in the original it's implied that she set Carrie up to go to the prom with her boyfriend so she'd be voted prom queen and could be targeted with pig's blood.There is also a further explanation for why they chose pig's blood and not paint or manure. In the remake a cell phone video of Carrie's opening menstruation scene is shown on a big screen TV during the climax, hence the blood connection.The screenplay changes for the worse are really the rest of the climax. I cannot imagine the climax in the original going any better. I loved the way the doors just open for her and then close behind her locking EVERYONE to burn to death as the deserve to for laughing at her covered in pig's blood.The remake goes overboard on CGI and silly levitation shots. Worse yet, there are survivors! There are fire trucks and ambulances and we see people being treated for injuries including Ms. Desjarin the gym teacher! WTF? The original was so much better! No one was able to call emergency services because everyone died! The second biggest problem to the FX or rather lack there of is the casting of Chloe Grace Mortez. Not that she's a bad actress, but she's the prettiest girl in school and she's being bullied? Come on! Sissy Spacek was great at portraying Carrie as the ultra nerdy shy girl whom would be bullied. We're supposed to pity Carrie, but it's hard to pity the prettiest girl in school. The remake could have easily solved this by casting an overweight or simply unattractive actress. But no, Hollywood couldn't do that.So all in all this REMAKE is worth a watch as it corrects the major pacing problem of the original and the production quality is strong except for the shoddy FX.Also good to see a cameo by Hart Bochner playing a slime ball the way only he can.Best of all, NO JOHN TRAVOLTA! That's a major improvement.",Carrie
136,FilmMuscle,An Emotional Catharsis at its Extreme,7,19 October 2013,"Since this is one of those remakes that Hollywood has been shamelessly and unhesitatingly producing (not referencing to Carrie, but in general), there will obviously be the type of crowd that tends to always favor the original over any remake or reboot, and in that case, there are two different ways of approaching this film. I, myself, haven't seen the original Carrie nor have I read the novel; thus, I entered the theater with a completely unbiased and pure mind, craving a fresh horror experience. Let's skip the synopsis bullshit, shall we- since most of the readers viewing this already have a clue of what it is they're thinking of seeing. So, with that being said, the picture highly benefits from some very strong performances as Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore bring their A-game as they almost always do. I have to digress for a moment or two to mention just how terrific Chloe is as a younger actress. She definitely seems to be the most serious and artistic with her role- choices and performances compared to most of the teenagers I frequently see in Hollywood. There have been countless complaints referring to how she's much prettier than her peers at school, and that's where the misunderstanding originates from. What they're essentially claiming is that you have to be ugly in order to be victimized by bullying. That's not necessarily true- absolutely not true, in fact- as your social skills also factor in. Carrie was raised in a disparate environment and can't exactly adjust to the atmosphere that these snobby, loudmouthed teenagers create. Therefore, her incapability of adaptation generates this sense of misplacement, increasing her vulnerability to all that notice her loneliness. I'm sorry if it's too prolonged of a tangent, but my goal is to simply point out that there weren't any casting errors. However, since the world thinks under this mindset: if she's good-looking, no one will pick on her- that's exactly the mentality we should rid ourselves of! Anyways, what you realize once you're finished with the movie is that it's actually quite enjoyable (nothing I doubted for a second, but lots did). It hooks you and entertains you the entire way and certainly doesn't outstay its welcome. In essence, it's an effective representation of an emotional catharsis at its extreme (relating to those we just hate and can't stand at our school). Now, on the opposite end of the spectrum, one will find various nonsensical moments throughout the developing plot; in other (more contemporary) words, the film has its great deal of plot holes. First of all, how is anyone supposed to believe that these recurring bullies attend almost every one of Carrie's classes? Wow, that same group happens to have every class together- the same jock, the same preps, etc. It's a highly implausible scenario that's only included for the sake of convenience. Without spoiling, there's a scene where one of the bratty teen girls somehow visits Carrie at her home. How the hell does she know where she lives and why would she pick this time of all others, no one will ever know. In addition, this seems to be yet another Hollywood movie where bullying really is over-exaggerated because I truly have a difficult time imagining that that extreme of bullying ever transpires in reality where you're cast into the kind of predicament that everyone in the entire school fully turns against you, some trying to downright murder you and others tripping you in the halls and focusing all their attention on you in the cafeteria instead of gossiping amongst their own groups. Ultimately, it's stereotypical and utterly unoriginal. If this more thematic material (bullying issues and whatnot) were developed in a more realistic fashion, then that would've helped the film seem more mature and meaningful. No, instead we are forced to witness the archetypal bullies deal with the outcast, which eventually leads to a final release. The very, very last shot was terrible in terms of its tonal shift and almost comical appearance, but that is a pretty minor gripe when discussing a 1 ½ hour movie. At the end of the day- and I'm speaking from a newcomer's perspective- Carrie is unquestionably a great time to be had this weekend at the movies, albeit a fair share of flaws in its delivery.",Carrie
137,tinovalkki,Quite lame teenage horror,5,3 November 2013,"There are two big problems in Carrie. First problem is story telling. Carrie is ought to be backward, bullied and vulnerable young girl who grows to a young woman who finds her telekinetic powers at the verge of adulthood. In principle movie tells that but instead of a victim Carrie grows to sadistic murderer. Movie express Carries powers too much at the beginning and that watering the grand finale. Other problem is acting. Julianne Moore is brilliant as a Carries schizophrenic and religious mother, but all the younger actors won't get almost anything from their roles. Also director makes mistake when she present Carrie a sadistic torturer and murderer, instead of vulnerable young sacrificial victim. Movie is not the the worst renewal filming what I have seen, but current movie waters Stephen Kings freezing first novel almost totally. Movie starts quite powerfully but becomes rapidly very lame and meaningless. Mediocre teenage horror, nothing else.",Carrie

BUT, not a horrible film either.",6,5 January 2014,">> MINI REVIEW << After hearing different things about this version of the Stephen King book, I was hoping this would be a very good remake. But after seeing it I thought it was about average at best. Yes the effects were pretty good, but compared to the original it seems that yet again there didn't need to be a remake. If you are a true horror fan, then you wouldn't need to see this as the original would suffice, and in my opinion a better version. But for those who were born after the 80's then this version would be more for them (in my opinion). It just seemed that this remake was produced to retell the story for those who think that the original 1976 movie maybe ""too old-school"" for them. But for me the original is the better version. In saying that I thought Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore played the parts well. So I give this version a 6.5 out of 10. Not a bad movie, but not that great either.",Carrie

She seemed like she was just a coat away from being pretty. It's equivalent to the movies where guys dress up as women and the only time they can tell it's a guy is when they take off the wig.This Carrie isn't anywherr near the vulnerable, shy, waiting to bloom Carrie I originally thought I would see. I can't get over how cartoony the characters are as opposed to being real.Main point of contention is the prom scene. She looks like she's conducting a mad hatter orchestra as opposed to getting revege. Spacek used her eyes to convey emotion like Michael Corleone in The Godfather II.

142,fredberglyle,CARRIE didn't scare me instead like her again,6,10 May 2014,"The movie is a remake of 1979 Brian De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's novel. This remake did not completely redo the screenplay, yet not completely avoid the original. The director did slight modifications to include current technologies like mobile phones, you-tube etc. into the movie script and a lovable CGI. Seriously the gory and disturbing climax is well handled with special effects. Another distinguishing factor of the movie is the actor Chloe Mortez, who is actually a teenager (just as the character mentioned in the novel) in contrast to Spacek in 1979 movie. Chloe was good but I felt Julianne Moore was better as a deeply religious mother.If you'd like to compare the two versions, I'd say the original one is better. Number of scenes in the remake could've been screen-played better. This one has a scene at the climax where Carrie actually welds a door-latch (which is not possible by her telekinesis) which didn't convince me. So if you've watched original then you can avoid it or see it once. For me, I loved the story Stephen King has written so liked it.",Carrie

144,themissingpatient,Carrie: The Glee Version,2,13 January 2014,"Based on Stephen King's best-selling novel, Carrie is an overly shy high-school outcast who becomes a target for much ridicule leading up to the senor prom. At home, she is heavily sheltered and abused by her mentally-ill, religious extremist mother. As things continue to get worse for Carrie, she discovers she has telekinetic powers.By now, everyone knows the story of Carrie. The novel was first adapted to the big screen by writer Lawrence D. Cohen and director Brian De Palma in 1976. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were nominated for Academy Awards for their roles and it launched the career of a then-unknown John Travolta. The film remains a beloved classic horror that is still as chilling today as it was 37 years ago. In 2002, the novel was adapted for a television movie starring indie horror queen Angela Bettis, with a running time of 132 minutes. The television version took a different approach to the story yet failed in all comparisons to the 1976 theatrical version.Now we have what is being marketed as a ""re-imagining"" of the story of Carrie. Do not be fooled by this. A re-imagining would be a different interpretation of the story, as the television version was. This Carrie is just a remake of the 1976 version and a bad remake at that.Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who co-produces and writes for the celebrated television series, Glee, and Kimberly Peirce, the director of the acclaimed 1999 film, Boys Don't Cry, did not seem to bother keeping this over-told story from being as mundane as possible. While Julianne Moore isn't near as frightening as Piper Laurie was in the role of Carrie's mother, Chloë Grace Moretz does the best job she can. It's Judy Greer, as the gym teacher, who really gives the best performance.You should never feel safe in a horror movie. The polished Hollywood look of the production design gives a sense of security because everything looks too perfect to be real. Brian De Palma's split screens and editing decisions were ridiculous at times but the film had a surreal, fearful atmosphere. With this updated version there is no sense of unpredictability, which leaves no chance to scare even the few who are unfamiliar with the story.The original Carrie wasn't without it's flaws however the little differences found in this remake are cringe-worthy, at best.",Carrie

146,ksj870,"Another Remake, Another Letdown",3,31 October 2013,"The original version of CARRIE, directed by Brian DePalma and starring Sissy Spacek, stands as a bona fide horror classic. The remake isn't so much a remake as a glossy re-packaging. It doesn't explore any new angles or re-interpret the plot in any meaningful way. It's just the same story, minus the inspiration and the sheer terror which marked the original movie. In short, it's a total waste of celluloid.Director Kimberly Pierce seems totally disconnected from her own film, almost as though she's imagining her own movie as still directed by Mr. DePalma. She doesn't take any significant changes in tone or offer us any different perspectives. It's almost a paint-by-numbers job.The casting is, with one notable exception, a disaster. Not that the actors in this film are bad or don't try, but they are almost all poorly cast as the characters they are required to play. Chloe Grace Moretz is a most unfortunate choice to play Carrie White, the poor misfit who develops the power to move things with her mind, with terrifying results. Moretz doesn't look much like a social misfit. Other than her outdated clothes, she comes across like a typical teenage girl, which Carrie most certainly is not, even if that's what she wants to be. Moretz never captures the insecurity, vulnerability, and desperate longing that Sissy Spacek brought to the role back in the 70s, and a Carrie White without those characteristics simply isn't Carrie White.Gabriella Wilde isn't a much better choice to play Sue Snell, either, and should have been cast to play the villainous Chris Hargensen instead of Portia Doubleday. Doubleday shows some skills in her role as the wicked, spiteful Chris, Carrie's primary tormentor, but she lacks the overwhelming presence of malice and venom that Nancy Allen personified in the original.The only cast member who really excels is Julianne Moore as Carrie's fanatical mother, Margaret White. Moore's performance is at least equal to that of Piper Laure in the original film, and conveys a woman tortured by an indescribable madness which masquerades as religious fervor. Moore makes Margaret White believable but nonetheless overpowering and truly scary, and her magnificent turn is the showcase of the film. It's not enough to save it.Surprisingly, or perhaps not given our Politically Correct times, the movie is actually less violent than the original. Despite a few flashy special effects sequences, the climactic Prom Scene is a lot less malevolent and lethal than the same moment in the DePalma film. What should be mind-numbingly horrifying is instead merely spectacular, which isn't at all the same thing.Sometimes remakes work well. Occasionally they even surpass the original. The 2013 version of CARRIE is not one of those times. Don't waste your money. The original's on NetFlix.",Carrie
147,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,5,1 November 2013,"According to Wikipedia, a one-hit wonder is 'a person or act known mainly for only a single success. The term is most often used to describe music performers with only one hit single, or that have one signature song that overshadows their other work'. By that logic, the original 1976 Brian de Palma classic Carrie could be described as a one-scene wonder. Of course, that one single scene is great and memorable, but is it really worth to see through a 100 min long movie just for one single scene? My answer is no, but Hollywood begs to differ, so this year we got a Carrie remake. My only explanation for the huge success of the 1976 version is that the infamous prom scene happened at the very end, so everyone, by that point, forgot the rest of the movie and left the theaters feeling satisfied. I know that the prom scene is the best aspect in the original Carrie, but putting all chips on it seems unreasonable and silly, and because of that the whole movie felt uneven. The remake isn't much better. In every possible plot summary you can find out how Carrie goes all nuts on her prom. In any other case, this would be considered as a spoiler, but nothing else happens during the movie so the spoiling the ending is mandatory.In case you don't know the story, this almost screen to screen remake also follows Carrie (Chloë Grace Moretz), a young introverted student who has telekinetic powers and whose mother is a strict, religious nut job (Julianne Moore). One day in school, Carrie gets her first period and the rest of the girls laugh at her and bully her – especially one girl named Chris (Portia Doubleday). Another girl named Sue (Gabriella Wilde) feels sorry for Carrie and convinces her boyfriend Tommy (Ansel Elgort) to take Carrie out to the prom. He does, Carrie accepts and the rest is pretty much history.I had pretty much the same problems with this remake that I had with the original movie: it is uneven and, to a certain degree, boring. A big number of scenes that can be found in this movie, can also be found in every other high school movie (talking about the prom, picking at the misfit, popular girls are bullies etc.) and there's the always present Stephen King motive of a bully being a bully just for the sake of being a bully. So this movie, instead of dwelling deeper into its thematic, settled for the same old clichés, just setting them into the modern day of YouTube and Smartphones, making the clichés ever more irritating. The two main actress did a fairly good job. Julianne Moore is great as ever, in spite of this remake being below her level. Chloë Grace Moretz is believable as Carrie, however, she doesn't look as disturbed as much as the character of Carrie should be – and in that way Sissy Spacek is much better. Furthermore, the movie has several unintentionally funny scenes which, more than a few times, got me out of the overall mood.The payoff in the movie – the prom scene – is decent, but not quite as effective as in the original. It felt too short and relied more on CGI rather than on practical effects, but it still is the definite highlight of the movie. Nonetheless, I don't think that this movie, or the original, should be praised based only on that one scene, no matter how good it is. That's like reviewing a restaurant's quality based only on the dessert, while completely ignoring the appetizer and the main course. This movie's appetizer was forgettable, the main course was boring and the dessert was slightly disappointing. I won't be eating at this restaurant ever again.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",Carrie
148,seckinlergafri,Great horror movie in 2013,8,31 July 2017,"Carrie (2013) is a supernatural horror film from the united states of this film directed by Kimberly Peirce and is a remake of the classic horror movie titled the same Carrie (1976) This film is lifted from a novel by the king of horror: Stephen King Carrie 16-year-old girl living with His mother is very religious and old-fashioned, at school. Carrie is always bullied by her classmates, but there is a kind teacher who always support Carrie, Carrie realized that he has the power of Telekinesis that is the power that can move objects from a distance, Tragedy happened at night Prom night. Carrie is stroked by a very evil girl .. Carrie is covered in blood .. Carrie fumes and kills and locks up the school building, the school building is burned down she kills the person who hurt her feelings, her mother attacks her and Carrie kills her mother and destroys her house .. Carrie also Died with his mother.Carrie (2013) is a pretty entertaining movie for me, I have not watched the original version of this movie, it's quite entertaining when Carrie who is at the prom night party gets furious and expels her telekinesis power to punish those who have hurt and destroy her feelings.",Carrie
149,The_moan_of_all_moans,What's her name again?,4,1 December 2013,"Now, it is blatantly obvious that remakes are basically destined to come up short when being compared with the original. And of course their purpose isn't necessarily to compete with it's predecessor, but to reach out to a new audience. So, when modernising the 1976 version they have opted for more special effects and of course modern references (such as mobiles and facebook) and there's nothing wrong with that; it's necessary. That aside, even with the big money injected into this remake it comes across...well...cheap. When comparing the films as a whole, the 1976 version wins hands down, but that's to be expected. And as much as they try to make it their own in ways,at the end of the day it is the same concept. Moretz's performance -for me- was to be perfectly honest ...rubbish. Might be people who disagree, but she was so bland, (and admittedly a tad harsh), her attempt at reprising such an iconic role was feeble. I was a little disheartened that she was chosen for the role and she didn't make me eat those thoughts. At some points the story just seems all over the place and i became very uninterested because the execution was so placid. Even the ""special"" effects where unimpressive. The one and only redeeming feature of this film was Julianne Moore's exceptional display as Margaret White. Now if Chloe Grace Moretz was at one end of the spectrum then all the way at the other end is Julianne Moore. Dazzling display.If directors would just spend more time coming up with original ideas (as hard as that is)instead of relying on remakes then it would be a much better place in the world of movies. A forgettable film with a forgettable lead role. What was her name again?",Carrie
150,hjchuijbregts,Better than....,7,5 September 2020,"If I remember correctly, I never did like the original one. The remake for me was great. Great acting and scary at time. I think a must see.",Carrie
151,coljam21,Tween flick,5,25 October 2013,I was disappointed. Very disappointed. This was a tween movie. I did not expect the director to take the talents of Julianne Moore and Chloe Moretz and use it in a bland and predictable tween flick. I know that Chloe Mortez is still a teen but she certainly does not cater to the tween genre. The movie was OK but it was lacking. Both actors did a phenomenal job but the film was not put together well. I think the juxtaposition of Moore's and Mortez's award winning performance and a bunch of talentless nobodies playing high school children just didn't mesh.What saved the movie was the last 5 minutes. The carnage at prom that Carrie unleashed was the only entertaining part of the film. I know this movie has been made several times but I was determined to watch this one because the main cast. I guess even if the cast is stellar a director can still run the movie into the ground.,Carrie
152,StonedMagician,Above Average: 6.0,6,28 July 2019,"Just because the themes present in Stephen King's debut novel are timeless doesn't mean that they should be presented in multiple films. Brian DePalma's 1976 version is generally considered to be a horror classic, so director Kimberly Pierce had a lot to live up to. The new version does do a few things differently, the best example being the renewed focus on Carrie. The 70s adaptation paid equal attention to all sides, which resulted in insufficient time to actually get to know Carrie as a character. The remake does not make the same mistake. While there are of course some scenes that focus on her antagonistic classmates, all events of importance are seen squarely through Carrie's eyes. A little extra character development goes a long way here. The fact that Chloe Moretz delivers a better performance than Sissy Spacek doesn't hurt, either. That being said, the pre-prom drama is simply not as compelling as the original, despite the more focused screenplay. I quickly found myself growing bored, impatiently tapping my foot in anticipation of the defining moment. But once that moment is reached, the film truly outdoes itself. But by then, it's too little, too late.",Carrie
153,irishm,"Pointless, unnecessary retread",2,28 October 2014,"Okay, there was one clever update: I laughed when the girl whipped out her cell phone in the shower scene and started making a video of naked, bloody, screaming Carrie on the floor... that was certainly a credible thing for a smug teenager to do in the year 2013. Other than that, this remake fell flat.The girl who played Carrie had a constant wild, bug-eyed stare as she moved around the high school that was so over-the-top it didn't even pass as acting. No bullied girl looks like that, unless she finds herself walking into an active ambush. Sissy Spacek knew that: she played Carrie almost folded in upon herself, head down, books clutched tight to chest, just trying to get from Point A to Point B without making eye contact with anyone or being noticed at all... a tremendously effective choice.Julianne Moore as Margaret White was okay, and probably the best actor in the movie, but I missed the wonderful Piper Laurie. The actors playing the other teens were all completely, totally, and immediately forgettable.There were a few random strange things that didn't track with me. The area around the high school didn't look at all like Maine, but being from Maine I'm used to that. The big climax at the end involved hundreds of round rocks falling down, presumably from the upper stories of the house... which was a frame house. Possibly the rocks were supposed to have come from the skies, but that wasn't made clear and it just looked like the wrong kind of building materials were crashing down.This movie was a curiosity, nothing more. I watched the original right afterwards to get the bad taste out of my mouth. In addition to the previously-mentioned original cast, Nancy Allen rocked the part of nasty Chris, William Katt was such an appealing Tommy, PJ Soles shone as Norma, and John Travolta was a perfect boneheaded Billy. Personally I think Amy Irving's part could have been played by many other actresses with an equally successful result, but she was okay too.Skip this one; go to the original.",Carrie
154,shawnmikedryer,Meaningless forgettable remake,3,31 December 2020,"As i enjoy some remakes, you'll soon grow to know i most specifically despise more than a few remakes. Carrie is probably on top of this list, maybe the most pointless remake i've ever seen. This 2013 version did not add one red cent of additional value when compared to the original, it was exactly the same in most ways yet Carrie in this film seemed to have a sort of disconnect with the audience and gains no sympathy in their eyes or mine. It could have been better if it didn't attempt to pander to the younger generation so intently. Even the healthy cast couldn't save this from mediocrity.",Carrie
155,Foxbarking,Offers Nothing New or Better Than the Original,6,5 February 2014,"What was this movie? Some have called it a remake while others called it a reimagining. I've even heard some people refer to it as a reboot, which is silly because that would mean ""The Rage"" was a credible sequel to the original movie. The fact is that it does not matter what you call it because this movie is really nothing to get excited about.The original ""Carrie"" directed by Brian DePalma has sometimes been criticized due to the lack of special effects. In the Stephen King novel, Carrie White ends up destroying the entire town out of rage. King has always rightly defended DePalma's version because the director did very well with the money that was budgeted to him. This new ""Carrie"" does have more expensive effects.Where the new movie goes wrong, however, is that it is just a movie about the revenge scene. While DePalma's version concentrated more on the buildup of torment and hope that pushes Carrie over the edge, this new version simply wants us to get to the prom as quickly as possible. There is no tension, no emotion, nothing except a plot that quickly tries to get the viewer to the special effects laden revenge scene.In addition, the revenge scene is rather tame as well. Carrie's theatrics as she attacks her school mates are beyond cheesy. She looks like she is a dark lord of the Sith rather than a high school girl gone crazy. Although there is a bit more graphic death for Chris than in the original, it comes across as uninspired.All in all, this was not a bad movie. I gave it six stars because I was not bored. The movie was all right, but it was totally unnecessary. If you want to enjoy a movie version of Stephen King's book, ignore the remakes and re-imaginings. Watch the DePalma version as it is still the superior film.",Carrie
156,wadechurton,Bland and largely unnecessary but no disaster.,5,14 December 2013,"This remake of the 1976 classic wasn't as bad as I'd expected, but it wasn't all that good, either; just kind of meh. Aside from some cellphone use and the 'innovation' of a cruel schoolmate posting phone- camera footage of Carrie's traumatic first menstruation on the Net, it's practically a shot-for-shot remake of the 1976 original. The acting was actually pretty good overall, but despite being closer in age to the teen-aged character it's painfully obvious that Chloe Grace Moretz just doesn't have the same kind of gravitas that Sissy Spacek brought to the role, and she suffers by comparison. Making Carrie the most conventionally attractive girl in the whole movie also destroys a crucial point of audience identification with the character. When Carrie boldly ventures out of her comfort zone and dresses up for the prom, unusual-looking Spacek was endearingly awkward and heartbreakingly vulnerable. Moretz just looks prettier. On the other hand, Julianne Moore stole the show with a captivating performance as Carrie's psychotically religious mother. The direction was a bit pedestrian, too, and so what you end up with is kind of like one of those foreign movies remade by Hollywood and losing something crucial in the translation. In fact, it felt more like a TV movie adaption than a cinematic release. The 2013 'Carrie' is by no means a disaster, but neither is it a kick-ass triumph either; The pivotal prom scene wasn't quite as 'epic' as it was in the 1976 original, and moreover it is Spacek's monumentally creepy blood-covered stare from that version which remains the enduring iconic image most closely associated with the story. Moretz never comes close. Like most remakes of foreign movies it's just an unnecessary 'cover version', destined to being decisively overshadowed by the original.",Carrie
157,movieman89-2,Actually one of the best remakes I have ever seen. Please mind the spoilers,9,8 December 2013,"Usually I'm very hit and miss with horror remakes nowadays. Especially after the abysmal Evil Dead remake. I then heard that Carrie was going to be remade and thought ""Oh for goodness sake. It doesn't need remaking. I love the original"" Then I heard that Chole Moretz was taking the role for Carrie. This I really was unsure about because Carrie is a very wimpy character and Moretz I didn't think at first can pull that off. Really like the actress don't get me wrong. Then the trailer came and I was really shocked of how it good it looked. So I thought what the hey, I'll support King (my hero) and go and see this. Well let me first say my negative thoughts, I take them all back.The story kept the same and still worked brilliantly. It has a lot of dialogue from the original but its not word for word or shot for shot, like the remake of The Omen which was exactly the same as the original. The story has scenes from the book that weren't in the original movie, which was awesome to see. Also there are the original scenes from the original but has a lot of new added scenes for the story, which worked and were brilliantly effective. Please mind the spoilers as I said before. Examples I can name are the beginning scene with Margaret White giving birth to Carrie and nearly killing her which was very nerve wracking to watch, more scenes of Carrie practising her ability. One of the best was the stand off of Carrie and Hargensen before Hargensen dies I felt Carrie's absolute hatred and Haregensen's determination to kill Carrie in this scene. Where-as in the original, Hargensen's death happened very suddenly without any standoff. I won't name any others so I won't ruin it more than I already have done. The prom scene was absolutely amazing. It's not as slow moving as the original. It is very sudden and still very shocking.The added CGI actually worked very well. It was very subtle and not over the top. To be honest, you can go mad with it because of Carrie's ability.The acting was very good. Portia Doubleday pulled off the role of the vile Chris Hargensen brilliantly well. Gabriella Wilde did very well as the guilty character Sue Snell. Now for Billy Nolan, Hargensen's boyfriend, I actually felt threatened by his character. Unlike the original (not insulting Travolta, who did brilliantly) his character in the original was just an idiotic, wannabe tough guy. This one was actually tough and threatening. Now relating to what I said about Moretz not having what it takes to play Carrie, well how wrong I was. She was fantastic. Her character was so much stronger than Sissy Spacek's. Instead of pulling the wimpy character, she pulls off the outcast ""weird kid"" character. There was even a few points where she really stood up towards her mother, which was brilliant. It literally had me saying ""my god, she's butch"". So the rock on devil horns go up to Moretz. Again, not insulting Spacek's performance from the original, which was awesome. Julianne Moore's performance as the religious psychopathic mother Margaret White was superb. I actually would say that was her best role. Both Moretz and Moore stole the show. The chemistry between them was great.The connection to the characters was very strong. Especially Carrie's. From Sue Snell, there was a strong act of guilt from her which really worked for the story. The only thing that I would say was a bit weak with the character connections was the gym teacher Ms Desjardin. In the original, there was a stronger bond between her and Carrie, where-as in this, it was very little. Also I didn't think Judy Greer's acting was as good. She didn't pull off the toughness of the character as well as the original. But it's not enough to ruin the whole film.So overall, the film was brilliant. Is it better or worse than the original. To be honest I love them both the same, there were a few points that were better in the original and there were points that are better in the remake. So King and horror fans, your in for a treat. Because as a King fan myself, very very impressed I would recommend watching the original first because then you'll know where it first began. I really hope Mr King will like this movie.",Carrie
158,plutus1947,Good But Not As Good As 1976 Version,7,5 January 2014,"For me Sissy Spacek WAS Carrie White and I feel it would be near impossible to top her performance in the 1976 original.The same applies to Piper Laurie for her portrayal of Carrie's mother Margaret.Both Sissy and Piper were nominated for Oscars for their performances and rightly so.This is to take nothing away from Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore who played Carrie and Carrie's mother respectively. Both actresses played their parts admirably.It is always extremely difficult to produce a remake which is as good as, or better than the original and unfortunately this movie is no exception.There has been a marked improvement in Special Effects since 1976 and this is reflected in the scenes which required them in the 2013 version.For the most part the storyline was faithful to both Stephen King's prose and to the 1976 movie. There were a few differences mainly brought about by the improved Special Effects now available.I have given this remake a 7 rating and would still recommend it as well worth watching.In my humble opinion Carrie is the best King novel to be transferred to the screen. This applies to both the 1976 and 2013 versions.",Carrie
159,JamesIan2021,Superb Remake,7,15 May 2015,"The film opens with a woman screaming bloody murder, as the camera pans up the stairs a woman's broken water trickles down the stairs, then you see Margaret White covered in blood praying for forgiveness as she gives birth to a baby, in which she attempts to murder with a pair of scissors. With an opening like that you know you are in for a bloody ride and a heavy one at that. You just can't please anyone with remakes, except me. Carrie is one of the finest horror remakes, and also a big job for Director Kimberley Pierce to revamp the iconic classic, but she's done fantastically making you feel for Carrie, and Pierce stages elements of horror and power superbly never indulging in clichés or CGI overload. Chloe Grace Moretz is tremendous as the lonely and isolated Carrie who discovers she has telekinetic powers, but with the overbearing nature of her bible bashing mother and high school bullies she is by definition pushed to the absolute limit, and unleashes her powers. The prom scene ignites onto the screen in a mass of blazing carnage and glory, every camera shot looks incredible, and Moretz snarls and quivers as she destroys anything in her wake, you see the gory damage and detail and bones breaking. I was jaw dropped and amazed at the visuals and gore, payback here is a beautiful thing and it's delivered without mercy, you feel good for Carrie as she gets her own back. Julianne Moore is terrifically terrifying as Carrie's mother, she is a natural, it's a brilliant portrayal of madness. Gabriella Wilde nails it as Sue Snell who regrets her actions, as does Ansel Engort, these two play the sweeter characters well. Judy Greer dishes out some great one liners and I loved her sassy gym teacher performance. Portia Doubleday is awesome as the incredibly mean bully Chris Hargensen, she alone pushes Carrie over the edge, Doubleday grits her teeth and scowls with intensity! This outstanding cast up their game even more when the prom sequence explodes, this film roars to life and at times gets unbearable to watch, especially the knife slashing ending, that's the sign of impact and effectiveness. I highly recommend this, a true horror remake that stays honourable to the original yet adds a modern feel to it alongside Pierce's intensely head spinning direction.",Carrie
160,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Carrie,7,7 December 2013,"First off, it's going to be very hard not to compare this remake to the original. Not because of the original's success or how revered it was, but because of how similar both films are. This new remake of Carrie from director Kimberly Peirce, unfortunately, doesn't do enough to justify its retelling.The original Carrie explored the theme of power and control between adults and teenagers. Carrie's mother Margaret hits her when Carrie doesn't listen to her. And in another scene, a teacher cusses at a group of students and smacks one of them in the face in front of the entire class.What works against the remake is today's current standards of parenting. In today's age, hitting a child is much more frowned upon than it was in the seventies. If a kid is cussed or smacked by a teacher in school nowadays, they can legitimately fight back by bringing it to the school board or by calling the police. These politics ends up watering down the film's themes, removing a lot of the edges off of the story. The threat of violence, whether it's coming from adult onto the teenager or vice versa, is dampened. The state of today's politics is not something I hold against the film, but the film doesn't seem to want to challenge current social taboos and play in the politically incorrect. The entire effect of the horror is watered down as a result.Director Kimberly Peirce makes up for this by adding modern horror movie aesthetics onto the story. There are loud jump scares, sharp objects are held closely into people's faces making frantic expressions and people creepily walk by in the background undetected. The major difference between the original and the remake lies in the way that it scares its audience. In the original, the horror was a looming creepiness that stayed with me after the film ended. I reflected upon the inevitable tragedy of Carrie being an unfortunate outcast being pushed to the point of no return. In the remake, the horror is emphasized in the immediate present of the physical violence that's about to be unleashed.Everybody looks attractive and for a story about a social outcast in an image-conscious high school environment, that is a problem. In the novel, Carrie is described as a plump girl. Chloe Grace-Moretz is pretty regardless of how much the filmmakers try to dress her down. This works against her, but other than that, Chloe Grace-Moretz does a good job with what's she's given.Julianne Moore is scary as Margaret White. It's much more over-the-top than Piper Laurie's version. I would argue Moore's performance is scarier, if only because it was more psychotic and violent by comparison. The most engaging scenes are between Margaret and Carrie. The supporting characters end up becoming more black-and- white and it comes off bland. If you ask me, what makes the story so tragic are the gray areas, the edges and how it was hard to imagine how things could have ended otherwise.Carrie is an okay adaptation that doesn't completely honor the mechanics of its tragic story and deters from challenging the political correctness of today. It comes off more like a fairy tale than a tragedy. What the remake ends up proving is how tight the original movie was and how things are much scarier when the horror stays with you long after the story has ended. I can only say this because I seen the original film. So overall, people who haven't seen Brian DePalma's Carrie will probably like this version more by default.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",Carrie
161,alexcomputerkid,Carrie is a positive remake that pays homage to the original as well as bringing a good new and fresh light to this story.,7,23 October 2013,"While living in his trailer, a very young author Stephen King started writing ""Carrie"" for Cavalier Magazine. After writing three pages, he thew it in the garbage but was later pressured by his wife Tabitha to finish it. King, an English teacher at the time shaped the story from two girls he knew from high school and grade school. After successful profiting from the successful novel, King quit teaching and moved full time to being an author.Only two years later in 1976, a film adaption was made and directed by Brian De Palma. A classic film for it's time, it made every actor in the film to what they are today and as the saying goes ""The movie made the book and the book made Stephen King"". You can also say that after the Carrie movie it was the norm to make as many as possible film adaptions of Stephen King novels.Now in 2013, there is a Carrie remake. Actually, you could say it's the second remake of this story with a 2002 TV film being the first remake but no one really saw it. To me, remakes are always a mixed bag. It's puts an older story into the present world while putting new actors in. But usually there is a question of why do need a new story of one we have seen once before and it usually shows that the director does not a have creative bones. If a remake like this goes bad, it's a waste and just a bad film to usually good story or in the rare case sometimes, a bad film to a poor story (Prom Night).Following the same story as original and using similar dialogue, Carrie is about Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is an awkward teen who does not fit in well at high school. After a tampon incident in the girls locker room, Carrie learns that she has telekinetic powers that changes her life dramatically. This is a story of horror, teen life and culture.Carrie is a movie and more important than most remakes, where the cast is important. The story works and revolves around characters more than the other elements of the film. Chloe Grace Moretz has been around since even before 2010 with small parts but then found herself cast in larger movies like ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" and ""Kick-Ass"". She is a child actor that really has had a lot of variety to her career. Being pretty as she is, it's very hard to envision Moretz ever being an outcast in school but it's a flaw that is overshadowed by a powerful performance where she really runs with this character.To anyone that's been through it, we know that the high school experience sometimes is not a positive one. While trying to do all the schoolwork, you have to try to fit into the cliques and the popular groups of the school. While Carrie White deals with that, she also deals with a crazy mother played by Julianne Moore. Unfortunately, we are given no background as to how she had Carrie along with a very confusing first scene of Carrie's birth. This character is very unsettling and awkward and you want her out of every scene though that's exactly what the character purpose is and why she is there. When we will look at Moore's career down the road, this no doubt this will be one of her most different and unique roles while being still very much a positive one in this movie.As mentioned earlier, this is a different type of remake with a really good cast and the prom scene is also very important different due to how it unfolds and it's importance to the plot and the close of the movie. There are some negatives with bad digital blood and a dated 70's feel but the prom scene does what it needs to do. It definitely shows another side to Carrie and is the big and spectacular action scene as it should be and it is very much out there.In the long run, Carrie has a lot of messages. A teen who in the end finds herself even though it's not a positive experience. A teen who's living with a difficult mother who never really resolves the issues with her. It is also about what really high school is and kid's manners and how they relate to each other. As with the original, there may not be a main overall message but this movie is still very powerful.While a good movie, its is still really unnecessary. I don't think it is something that there is a big audience for and there are still much better horror movies out there in 2013. Like the 2011 movie Fright Night even with it's flaws, Carrie is a positive remake that pays homage to the original as well as bringing a good new and fresh light to this story.",Carrie
162,johnnyboygrant,Potential,6,7 February 2021,The film was too over the top. Carrie didn't need the dramatics to show her powers. Calm statue like using just her eyes is a hell of a lot scarier. Oh! Carrie does not fly!!,Carrie
163,curzon_dax,I actually liked this better than the original,8,6 January 2014,"I especially liked the fact that they showed a more real, human face to the characters. Especially the boy, the dude was (more clearly this time) shown to not be a monster. And her being hurt by him dying (i.e. it wasn't just a burst of anger or they weren't all bad at all). Though, the choice of the actress is a bit weird. Since, especially her, was playing her whole life very courageous girls or even tomboys.But anyway, it's good because she's a good actress and got to play something new for a change.",Carrie
164,stsinger,The remake's strengths are what turns people off this film!,7,15 February 2014,"Well done remake, and its biggest strength is what makes most people dislike it. We are all used to teenagers being played by 20-somethings and that sort of makes things easier to handle. In the original ""Carrie"", Sissy Spasek -- a fully grown 27 year old woman -- played the 17 year old Carrie. Regardless of how good the performance was, we always knew that this was just a grown woman acting.In the remake, Chloe Moretz is 16 years old. She is also a strong actress, but having her play the role makes it so much more REAL. When she is whimpering in terror in the shower, she is not a near 30 year old actress pretending. It's crushing to watch. When she explodes in rage, it's a teenager being engulfed in rage. In this remake, Carrie is truly a teenager and a gut-wrenching tragic character. Very powerful stuff, and it can't be laughed away and that makes people very uncomfortable. Ignore the nay-sayers, worth watching",Carrie
165,dhainline1,"I thought the acting was very good, but too much of the meat of the story was left out",7,24 October 2013,"I think Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore were both wonderful as Margaret and Carrie White. My complaint is this: Kimberly Peirce, in my mind, cut out the back stories of Carrie and her mother. She should have stuck to the original book more and show Carrie as an infant using her telekinetic powers to float her baby bottle around. This happened a week after Carrie's great grandmother, Sadie Cochran died. Sadie could twirl the sugar bowl around with her telekinetic powers and light fires in the fireplace with just a stare. Carrie also sent the stones raining down on her house at age 3 when Margaret punished her for looking at the bare-chested neighbor lady and asking about her breasts. Even the 2002 TV ""Carrie"" touched on that with Jodelle Ferman as young Carrie and Angela Bettis as teen Carrie. Margaret's childhood and early indoctrination into religious extremism should have been shown as well!",Carrie
166,dilloncamp,Seriously not bad!!,7,20 March 2021,"Compared to the original this ""remake"" is actually pretty damn good.Very dark and very tense. You really get a feel of why Carrie is the way she is.Also seeing Carrie have actually knowledge and sympathy towards those who showed her compassion was a nice turn from the original. Instead of her blindly killing everyone in her path no matter what they have done for her.Julian Moore plays Carrie's extremely protective and religiously insane mother exceptionally, and Chloe plays a great Carrie, both really making you feel for each of the characters while being equally terrified of both.",Carrie
167,briandwillis-83825,Awful,4,26 October 2020,"A miscast and unfortunately stale remake with not much new to offer except updated computer effects for Carrie's telekinetic powers that don't impress as they should.

168,prolelol,One of my favorite recent horror remakes! Excellent film.,10,19 October 2017,"I just finally re-watched it after 4 years when it released. First off, I love the original ""Carrie"", I also thought the new one is still an excellent remake. I thought it was amazing, well done, quite pleasant, touching, heart-breaking film. I liked Chloë Moretz's performance and she did a fine job. She gave a better Carrie role than from the original because I consider that Sissy Spacek was way too old for the role which she was one of the main problems I have with the original, but she gave a fine performance too. I loved the original Margaret, Carrie's mother who is obsessed with her religious beliefs, I also thought Julianne Moore was fantastic in it. She gives a creepy performance. Her messy hair made her character even more creepier. I liked the prom scene better than from the original because it is a bit stronger scene and I didn't like the way they put two screens from original prom scene. I thought the special effects and CGI weren't bad, it looked really nice. I don't accept any complains about the story, it was still good as the original, but has lower rating because horror remakes are hard to like and always compare it with the old movie. Carrie (2013) is definitely, in my opinion, one of the best horror remakes of the last 10 years. My rating: 10/10.",Carrie
169,Humdinger69,"As it's own movie and as a remake of the original Carrie, a mixed bag",5,3 November 2013,"I actually saw this movie before I saw the original Carrie, actually, I believe I have seen the original Carrie, but I was so young I don't remember one thing about it. But I did have a chance to view the original Carrie on Netflix. So what did I think of it? It was great! This movie however, by itself and as a remake, is a pretty mixed bag.Chloe Grace-Moretz gave a (mostly) good performance as Carrie, the outcast who everyone is mean too and, after discovering she has telekinetic powers, eventually gets pushed too far. Julianne Moore also gave a good performance as Carrie's mom, any scene with her in it was unsettling to some degree. I didn't really have a problem with any members of the cast, they all did good in my mind, but they did not outshine their predecessors.The main problem I had with the movie was the ""mainstream approach"", the notion that your average mainstream moviegoer cannot enjoy a movie unless at least one thing blows up. I'm not saying I'm opposed to that, there's nothing wrong with a mindless action movie, but this is not a mindless action movie. This is a horror movie, the kind where things like that just do not fit. I will admit the climax in the original Carrie was... a bit cheesy, and things blew up in the original Carrie as well, but it was not done with the same ""ooooooh! Explosions! CGI kills! Cool!"" mindset that this one was.Now that I've seen the original Carrie, I'm able to look at the remake in a whole new way. Does that mean I think it's any better? No, not really. It wasn't a bad movie, and I appreciate the attempt to modernize a good horror movie that some might view as outdated, but with Carrie, it just wasn't necessary. A lot of the reviews on here seem to be either love it or hate it. I myself am pretty neutral. I can't recommend this one but if you are planning on seeing it I would recommend at least watching the original first.5.5/10",Carrie
170,DrPhibes1964,A partial review,4,26 June 2021,"Full disclosure right off I had no interest in seeing this when it played at the theatre where I worked but I was curious to see how the prom sequence compared to the original De Palma version. I sat in on the final thirty minutes or so. The casting of Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz was totally wrong. Even in the brief span of time I watched either they couldn't hold a candle to the performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, the latter being the most terrifying aspect of the film. Both Moore and Moretz were too ""attractive"" for their respective roles,especially Moore. She never inspired the same sense of menace that Piper Laurie brought to the character of Margaret White. She was truly terrifying. But we get the my primary problem with this pivotal section of the film and what the entire story has been building to. When Carrie gets the bucket of pig's blood dumped on her it is obviously a CGI effect. At this moment I had to restrain myself from laughing or else disrupt the sparsely attended theatre. It got sillier from that point onwards as Carrie is turned into a graduate from the X-Men academy. In the original it was done with practical effects,namely ""real"" blood, real fire, and just the chilling expressions on Sissy Spacek's face and eyes. It was unforgettable. But in this age where a CGI effect is preferable to a practical one. In the original you can feel the wetness and smell the stench of the blood that soaked Carrie. In this version it looks applied carefully, almost sculpted by a make up technician, in short very fake looking. Her path of destruction is more unintentionally funny than scary as she scoots along employing her X-Men powers. I cannot recall the rest and it left absolutely no impression on me, unlike the original that haunted me for hours after seeing it in '76. Given the primitive technology at this time the moment when Carrie uses her power to impale her mother with various kitchen utensils is impressive, vastly better than the CGI utensils hurling through the air in the remake. I have absolutely no interest in seeing the film in its entirety. It is probably unbearably dull.",Carrie
171,LordJiggy,As if made for the subtlety-impaired,3,6 January 2014,"Whew, with cable everyone knows the basic story of ""Carrie,"" thanks to the very effective film put together by the not-so-closet misogynist Brian (""How many times can I kill my wife the actress in my own films"") DePalma. Along with the gore, it was anchored by two tremendous performances from Piper Laurie as her nutty mom and an Academy Award nominated performance by a radiant and truly gifted Sissy Spacek. Ms. Moore and Ms. Moretz are also gifted actresses, but for the love of anything with cinematic worth, who thought this script was even competent? (SPOILER) It's not enough that the religious fanatic mom (a stereotype that was old and tired long before the original film) is so stupid she doesn't know she's pregnant, no, we have to show she's extra disturbed by having her gouge herself with fingernails and sewing implements.Ms. Moretz was let down not only by the script, but by the director. Chloe convincingly shows us a frightened, abused child, but then it's time to (SPOILER) bust out the library books and discover, really early on, that she has powers. And she's playing with the powers through the movie until the end. In the DePalma film Carrie's response to the horrible hazing was a primal psychic scream of inchoate outrage, the abused child striking out blindly against all those who had tormented her (real and imagined), a terrified tantrum, but in this far inferior remake, Moretz's Carrie is consciously vengeful, stalking and striking and finding in a way that made her far less sympathetic than Spacek's Carrie.Sorry, it was just a waste of time. Ms. Moretz, you can do so much better than this.",Carrie

This remake of the original by the same name stays true to its book and original film and is way better. I was very impressed with the film and how its fun t see how film has changed over the years. The effects were great. the acting was great, and there was a lot more to the story. I applause the longer prom scene as in the original the scene was quick and brushed off. I loved this remake and really worth watching. The story is also important as there are just very corrupted people in the world and one act of kindness can make a big difference, though one wrong choice that can steer a night ever so wondrous like prom, crazy. I highly recommend the film for those who haven't seen or those who think this movie is a flop because believe me, this was great!""Carrie had some sort of power.

173,CrisMovieCorner,Doesn't hold a candle to the original!,3,17 February 2014,"So I finally got to watch ""Carrie"" last night, I had been looking forward to watching it since it was announced I believe 3 years ago now. I was and still am a huge of the original from 1976 Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were phenomenal in their roles. They got Oscar nominations for their roles I believe, ""you will know her name"" is also a terrible tag-line for the movie we ALL already know her name being Horror fans or not.Within the few minutes of meeting the friendless high school reject, she suffers what I can only imagine is the ultimate demeaning thing that could happen to a young woman when she gets her period while showering with her classmates. Which is made a whole lot worse by queen bitch of the school Chris played by Portia Doubleday orchestrates the whole class in a chant of ""Plug it up!"" while they are throwing feminine products over Carrie's cowered body.Sue Snell played by Gabriella Wilde after initially taking part in the antics soon feels for Carrie, in order to make things right between herself and Carrie she persuades her boyfriend High School jock Tommy played by Ansel Elgort to take Carrie to the upcoming prom. Shortly before being asked to prom Carrie discovers that she has telekinetic powers (the ability to move objects big or small with the power of her mind). Carrie first of all declines the invitation later she nervously accepts ignoring the request of her mother to not attend. Carrie makes her own dress, during her first ever dance all her anxiety, pain and anguish all lift and she is filled with happiness and glee. Until something goes horribly, horribly, horribly wrong for the young girl, while on stage with Tommy after they have unsuspectingly been crowned prom queen and king.While on stage Carrie is part of a horrible prank organised by Chris and her boyfriend Tommy in which releases her uber Carrie powers in which can only be described as a hell-hath-no-fury ending. Which I will leave to either your imagination or if you bring yourselves to watch it. I will say, HOLY HECK!!! This time around in Periece's adaptation they venture much more into Carrie experimenting with her powers, in the De Palma version Carrie has very limited if any control over her powers. In the recent release Carrie is much more in control of her powers and what she is doing, while in ""anger mode"" Chloe Moretz was directed to do some awful decisions that never really went with the character like silly post credit eye edits and these kind of Japanese horror style body jerks. These characteristics are a waste of Chloes talent, plus Chloe is too much of a pretty, confident looking Hollywood looking girl, which doesn't work for who she is portraying.The original release had a much creepier vibe than the modern release and to go with that this new film was lacking in tension or character development and chemistry. It didn't feel at all like Tommy had any sincere feelings towards Carrie it felt like he was just doing it because Sue told him too. I know this movie was never meant to be a straight up Horror, a lot of Stephen King's work usually isn't this movie just wasn't creepy at all like it could/should have been.Going into this having seen the original myself it left me a bit disappointed, I guess if you went into this never seeing the original it was be a better film. Right now for me I'd say 3/10 going in as a new viewer to the story probably 5/10.",Carrie
174,JontheLobsterLover,Surprisingly not that bad.,7,27 October 2014,"When I mean by that is I was expecting the worst from this movie. When I first heard about Carrie being remade I was very excited. Then once I saw the trailer, my excitement dwindled. Now that I've watched it at home I wish I would of stuck it out and seen it in theaters. Carrie was the first Stephen King book I've ever read, and I am huge fan of the original. I have no problems with movies being remade, as long as they are done well. There is a lot of love for the story coming from this guy. The movie does start of on the wrong foot for me. I wasn't a fan of the immediate opening, or anything up until after the shower scene. Once that scene happens, the movie picks up. I thought Chloe did a phenomenal job as Carrie. I agreed with a majority of people when I thought she was too pretty to play the part. But the girl's facial expressions can win her awards alone. The scene at the Prom where she goes all ""Carrie"" on everyone, I thought could of been done a little better. I thought she looked great in the blood, but some of the effects, and some of her poses could of been cleaned up a little.I did not like Julianne Moore in this movie. I love the woman, I think she's a great actress. However I feel she really didn't portray the mother well in my opinion. Could of done without her. What makes this a good remake is the fact that they can tell the same story, and still make it their own. Tell your side of it, but keep the material faithful to what we all know and love. I do believe, that they have succeeded in doing that with this film.",Carrie
175,koen_smit,Good adaptation of a legendary novel,8,17 November 2013,"I must admit, hearing there was going to be another adaptation of Stephen King's first book I read so long ago and possibly a remake of the 1976 movie that I thought was a good adaptation, I was a bit cynical. But after hearing Chloë Grace Moretz would portray Carry White and Julianne Moore her mother, I was getting more intrigued and curious about this.It's a story about bullying and what it can do the the victim. That topic is of all times. You soon realize the horror of the story is not Carrie (who has a telekinetic power that quickly develops) but the people around her, like her bible crazed mother and her evil classmate who is willing to do anything to make Carrie pay for being different.Julianne Moore plays an extremely traumatized woman. Every thought that she has that seems sinful must be punished by hurting herself. Julianne Moore is very scary in this role because you never know what she will do next. And you are waiting for her to snap. The rules of life she learned (herself) from the bible and her love for her daughter makes her confused. She portraits this really well, you feel sorry for her and understand her motives to do what she does. Chloë Moretz plays a perfect sweet naive Carrie that doesn't know what is happening to her, but during the story blooms into a more secure young woman. In the beginning of the movie she still tries to hide her head between her shoulders, but as she learns more about life outside her mother's views, she dares to show herself more and shake off the trauma of her mother. I think she is a perfect Carrie, because she keeps her innocence, even when she goes all judgment day on the prom guests. She is still the victim of the people around her. I think they did a good job with this story. I cannot say it's better than the original was in its time, but for this generation of filmmakers and moviegoers, I think this will make quite a big impression on the audience. So for me it's a great adaptation of a legendary novel.",Carrie
176,filmbuff-05706,"Not Bad, But It Is A Bit Mean To Religious People. (Spoilers are mild.)",6,23 November 2020,"If you look at my page, you will see that there are quite a few movies that I used to like and now I do not. Carrie, both the 1976 and 2013 version, is becoming part of that category as well. Obviously for this review I am focusing on the latter version.It's not that Carrie is a bad movie, far from it, but there is a major element of the movie that I never really cared for and now it's time that I come to terms with it and face the fact that, for me at least, this is not recommendable.This version stars Chole Grace Moretz as the title character Carrie, a high schooler who is shy and has a religious mother who takes her faith way too far. This gets Carrie bullied and she gets her revenge at the prom.The movie is very entertainig and well made for a remake. Moretz gives a great performance at just 16 years old and Juilanne Moore is chilling as her mother. From a film-making standpoint, this is a very good movie.But as I said, there is a major issue I have with the movie. While Juilanne Moore gives a great performance, I cannot stand for what is done with her character. She's supposed to be a Christian who takes her faith overboard. But there are many flaws with her so-called ""Christianity.""For example(spoilers ahead), Carrie showers at school and has her first period. Due to her sheltered upbringing, she was not told that this was natural, and so she freaks out- and thinks that she is dying. She is humilated at school for this, and her mother has to pick her up for the rest of the day.They go home and her mother berates her for her ""lust""- demonstrated by her showering with other girls. Carrie explains that it's a school requirement but of course she doesn't listen. She then makes her pray that Eve was weak and that the first sin was intercourse.Back up a minute! Pardon me but I need to be theological for a moment. If you read Genesis, one of the first commands Adam and Eve are given by God is to ""go forth and multiply"". Have sex and make babies. Adam and Eve are commanded this and Noah's kids must do this after the Flood. So sex is not a sin. Pre-marital sex, rape, and such are sins, but a married man and woman making love is a God-given gift to strengthen marriage and not a sin.Second of all, sex was NOT the first sin! The first instance of sex is mentioned in Genesis 4:1. The previous chapter describes Adam and Eve committing the first sin- by eating the forbidden fruit! For someone who is quite a Bible thumper(literally- she slaps Carrie with a Bible in this scene!), she should know this.Also, it makes no sense to think that sex is a sin- that's how babies are born! That is how Carrie was conceived(the mother tells Carrie that she and her father fell into temptation and she ""should have given her to God when she was born"") and also- the mother herself was conceived through sex!This continues and Carrie is shoved into a prayer closet to pray for forgiveness for showering with her classmates. And among other examples of horrible behavior, by the end of the movie, the mother tries to kill Carrie to amend for not not killing her at birth.I understand that Carrie's mother is an example of how extreme some believers can be, and she is therefore the villain, but that doesn't make it okay to put such a portrayal in a movie. I complained in my God's Not Dead review that all the Christians are good and the atheists are portayed as scum. This movie does the opposite. While Carrie is far better than GND, I can't stand for a movie that portrays Christians in this way. If I can't reccomend a movie where all atheists are evil, how can I reccommend one where the main Christians are evil?If you can find it in your conscience to see this movie, more power to you I suppose. But I do not intend to see this again, and I hope Carrie is avoided by more people. As a movie, I would have rated a 10- it was one of my favorite movies looking at it as a horror movie. But due to the mother aspect, I can only recommend it to those who would not be offended by such a thing.Carrie is considered the ""Girl from hell"". If you ask me, that could be an apt description of this unfortunate movie.Reverse Reccomendation: To see a great movie about religious hyporcisy, I suggest Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame. To see a better Chole Grace Moretz movie, see Hugo. For a better Juilanne Moore movie, see Magnolia.Finally, Carrie is based on a Stephen King book. As such, I suggest seeing these great movies instead- The Shining, Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, or The Green Mile. I also enjoyed Misery, which has a religious villian as well, but not to such an extreme. (Gene Siskel noted that it's a clever use of irony in his TV review.) These are all movies I would have a higher conscience with recommending.",Carrie

178,snaidu422,Better than the book,9,18 January 2014,"CARRIE is one of those rare movies which have surpassed the original both in presentation, character sketch and technical finesse. Carrie is about a shy, friendless girl ridiculed by all her peers in high school, the gym teacher Miss Desjardin is the only one sympathetic to her. Things are worse at home too, as her mother Margaret-an unwed mom, looks down upon her and raises her in a strict catholic manner. Things take a turn, when Carrie has her first period in a gym shower and all the girls led by the class bully Chris Hargensen rag her in the shower when they realize that she is 19 and still does not know anything about periods. Miss Desjardin comes to her rescue and explains to Carrie who is now terrified as she does not realize anything about her body functions. Sue Snell one of the girls involved in the incident starts feeling guilty for being a part of it and is also reprimanded by her boyfriend Ross. Chris on the other hand uploads the video on you tube and immediately gets debarred from the Prom. Carrie meanwhile realizes she has telekinetic abilities and can move objects and control movement of things, she researches on the subject and displays it to her mother in a moment of vehemence. Her mother thinks it is the work of the devil and her daughter is a witch. Sue forces Ross to take Carrie to the Prom and decides to stay away from the prom as a means of punishing herself for the treatment she meted out to Carrie. Carrie initially refuses to go as she thinks that it might be a trick, but Ross convinces her to come. The ridiculed Chris plans one last act of revenge on Carrie and rigs the ballot and makes Ross and Sue win the title of prom king and prom queen and when they duo get up to receive the honor, Chris has her moment of revenge and what follows is a literal blood bath as she and the entire town face Carrie's violent retribution. Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie White lives up to her role, as the shy, quiet girl, your heart goes for her and you are shocked and fell sad when she unleashes her power on the town-u understand her, get into her skin and you know how it is all going to end for her-for no fault of hers. Julliana Moore as Margaret White gives you the creeps in her character of the bible obsessed mom, the casting is apt, down to the wrinkles on the upper lip, giving her character the much needed effect. Portia Doubleday as Chris is the best choice for the role, you cannot stop hating her and end of the day you realize she is just a schoolgirl who deserves a spanking. You fell like choking her to death when you realize what she has planned for Carrie at the Prom. Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell, is the only glamor doll in the movie, a pretty blonde with a heart of gold-you root for this girl who sacrifices her prom night for a girl she feels she has been bad to. Her performance in the final sequences are worth a mention. Ansel Elgort as Ross, the most sought after boy in high school, plays his part well and endears himself to the female audience with his cho- chweet performance and you are shocked at his tragic fate. Music by Marco Beltrami blends perfectly with the screenplay and you do not realize that it is there. The prerequisite of a perfect composition is never to be loud but soft enough to touch that emotional chord inside you. Screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa remains true to the book but also builds the sequences to give you the character sketch for the actors-something which the original movie lacked. Direction by Kimberly Ane Peirce is apt, proves that a female director is always the best choice for a chick flick, she gets the audience prepared for the final bloodbath scene per se and it is like a good doctor revealing to a terminal patient about how long he has. CARRIE is not a horror flick, but yes it is movie with a classic supernatural twist and is a movie which will stay with you for at least sometimeT",Carrie
179,canadian58,Good remake,8,19 October 2013,"Chloe Moretz is perfect in everything she is in, no matter how small or large the role. Just a couple months ago I saw ""Kick Ass 2"", a completely opposite character than Carrie White. Just goes to show Chloe can do pretty much anything.The original Carrie is not one of my favorite movies, it's OK, but not one I would watch over and over. This remake is different. Follows the same story, but with today's special effects, makes it lots more fun to watch. This movie is very well put together, and all the actors are convincing in their roles. I enjoyed seeing Judy Greer, and also Portia Doubleday, who I haven't seen anywhere since Youth In Revolt. The first half is pretty subtle and quiet, aside from Carrie's mother and her religious outbursts, or whatever they are. But once the blood is spilled, it's a thrill ride from then on. This is definitely worth seeing, and I will be picking up a copy of it when it's released on DVD. 9/10",Carrie

181,BrentHankins,A familiar story elevated by the performances from its two leading ladies.,7,17 October 2013,"With bullying and school violence firmly embedded in the public consciousness, it seems only fitting that a film about the consequences of mistreating your peers should get a modern-day makeover, and nearly forty years after Sissy Spacek and her prom dress were drenched in pig's blood, Carrie is back on the big screen in this re-imagining of the 1976 cult classic.Chloë Grace Moretz stars as the titular teenager, whose strict upbringing at the hands of a religious fanatic mother (Julianne Moore) has left her sky, awkward, and a constant target for the cruelty of the popular crowd. Moretz turns in a stellar performance as a wide-eyed teen longing for a normal life, and Moore is creepily unhinged, terrifyingly devout and completely detached from anything resembling reality.But let's be honest - moviegoers will spend the entire film anticipating the iconic prom scene, and when Carrie's frustration finally boils over into rage and she unleashes her power on those that have wronged her, it feels incredibly satisfying. It's a shame that the climax is marred by excessive and unnecessary usage of CG effects, but when compared to the overall experience this is a pretty minor irritant.Carrie paints an authentic (and at times, uncomfortable) portrait of a young girl's sense of alienation, loneliness, and desire to be understood and accepted by those around her. Director Kimberly Peirce plays it safe with this remake, keeping the story beats and plot progression nearly identical, but updating them for new audiences and providing insight in the evolution of bullying in the age of social media. It feels a bit familiar, but still fresh enough to warrant giving this one a look.",Carrie
182,henferdeline,Not really good at all.,4,25 January 2014,"This movie has good FX. Chloe Moretz does a good impression as Carrie up until the character realises she's got telekinetic abilities. From then on, she'd be great in some X-Men flic, but not in this supposedly intense, self-conflicting story. Julianne Moore is great as the 3/4 religiously crazed mother. The original, Brian de Palma, movie was already far from the impact of one of King's best works. This movie is a lot worse. The main character, instead of living her horrid conflicts up to the cathartic climax, turns into a proto-hero-turned-villain. Superpowered villain, that is. I guess that if you've got time to spare and excessive amounts of popcorn lying around this can be fun...sort of....",Carrie

Its very faithful to the classic with around 70 to 80% of what was portrayed in the original being shown here. Once again this proves that movie remakes are worth watching when done in the right way. The story is simple, straight forward and nearly 100 % truth to the original material but still excitingChloe Grace Moretz plays the title role of Carrie perfectly much to my surprise. I thought she was great as Hitgirl but as Carrie, she was just plain awesome to watch. I felt really sorry for her and really loved it when she started going into a killing spree at the prom. Its like the feeling of they got what they deserve that I had in me. Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother Margaret was also great. This has got to be my favorite performance from her so far. The rest of the cast acted really well and the effects verygoodI really liked the shot where Carrie was walking on the road and those cars started blowing up beside her. It adds that evil intense moment to it. The movie itself for me wasn't really that scary but it was surely disturbing in most parts of it but that was what really made it great. Overall this is definitely in my top 5 films of the year and one which I will surely go see again. My final rating, a solid 9 out of 10",Carrie
185,HorrorFreak1997,"a good remake, but doesn't touch De Palma's classic",7,6 September 2016,"Carrie is a remake of a classic horror film adapted from the novel written by Stephen King, and was originally directed by Brian De Palma. this remake is directed by Kimberly Peirce in the year 2013 and was a surprisingly good film in an age where tasteless remakes flooded the movie market. while it does succeed on many levels it never quite matches up with the original. it is difficult to review a remake without drawing comparisons to it's source material, I will try to not linger on comparisons and be as brief as possible in that department.in technical terms this film sits just a few pegs below the original. De Palma's Carrie had some of the most beautiful cinematography ever filmed for a horror movie. while the camera work in this movie is definitely astounding it never quite lives up to what De Palma could do behind the camera. also the original did a much better job at making the climactic prom scene more surprising and horrific. De Palma slowly built up to that scene with great restraint. where this film showed a lot less restraint in the sense that it uses the powers Carrie has much more frequently and to a greater extent. Sissy Spacek (1976 version) is also much better in the role of Carrie, but Julianne Moore (2013 version) is much better in the role of carrie's mother.on it's own though this movie stands tall in the departments of acting, sound design, cinematography, lighting and also does a great job of modernizing the story for this generation. Chloe Grace Moretz does an excellent job as Carrie and really allows us to sympathize with her character. being so repressed (both sexually and in the general sense)and controlled while also having to deal with constant bullying and teenage torment. Moretz telegraphs this internal torment and builds it into the unstable and exhausted Carrie that we see after the prom scene perfectly. Julianna Moore really knocks it out of the park as carrier's mother. delivering an amazing performance as the parental figure with insecurities that she chooses to not face by hiding behind her religious beliefs, causing Carrie to suffer. when it comes to the writing not much was changed with regards to the plot, mainly we just get the ""benefit"" of modern effects. but these effects for the most part fall flat. while yes they look kind of impressive it is far to over the top. Carrie becomes comparable to a superhero. it was more so flashy than horrific. this is where the movie loses major points. the prom scene as well as everything after it ended up being fairly underwhelming.to top off the review ill say that while the film was definitely a very good and well made movie, key aspects of what made the original so horrific are missing and replaced with over the top CGI, weaker acting (with the exception of Julianne Moore) and weaker cinematography. definitely worth a watch and by all means it is a good movie, (better than just good actually) but it pales in comparison to the masterpiece that is the original film.the verdict: 7/10",Carrie

Chloë Grace Moret is already beautiful so there is not much to make her ""prettier"" for the prom. The whole movie is just lacking. The tele- kinetic powers seem forced and not scary. There are a few differences from the original. After Carrie is covered in blood at the prom - she does check to see if her date is OK...he is not! Is he dead? Probably. Amy Irving was perfect as Sue..the new Sue is milk toast. None of the cast lives up to their predecessors. The ending is so bad...has nothing on the original which made me jump out of my seat. People live at the end of this Carrie. After watching every ""Carrie"" re-make - I would NOT recommend this movie unless you are completely bored and there is NOTHING on TV. Very disappointing. AND - the filming of Carrie's first period in the shower and then posting it online...YIKES..welcome to the 21st century. Garbage in and garbage out. My recommendation SKIP IT!",Carrie
187,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: CARRIE (2013),2,24 February 2015,"In 1976, Brian DePalma brought Stephen King's telekinetic masterpiece to the big screen. A movie that now has received ""CULT"" status in the Horror World. It's one of those movies that everyone has either read the book that it's based on or have watched on TV at some point. Hell, some might have even seen CARRIE The Musical which according to Piper Laurie was quite ""a God awful sight"".As most would agree, CARRIE is a true Landmark. I remember that being one of the first Horror films to watch when I was a small boy that instilled true horror and yet made me cheer at the well deserved revenge on the tormentors. My fondest memory of this movie is probably the ending as it was with everyone, I was NOT expecting such shocker scare at the ending. It truly impacted me as a kid. So when I heard & saw trailers for the ""So-Called"" Reboot, which was advertised as being more true to the novel than the '76 version I can honestly say I WAS intrigued. But wasn't looking forward to another movie which has been remade already starring Angela Bettis in 2002 which I heard was a true Reboot of the film & had it's own original style placed into a already known storyline.In 2013, we open with something new ""The Birth of Carrie"". As the opening credits start, I once again was intrigued as I thought ""Finally fresh ideas"". Well, that didn't last very long once we hit the showers...this so-called reboot wasn't much of that after all. I will admit there were some new scenes & dialogue but, it was mainly updated material for the ""Tween Generation"" other than that it was almost a copycat of the '76 version aside from varying scenes which I mentioned earlier. Also, it was really hard for me to sympathize with Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie due to the fact that she has played bad-ass chicks (ie. let me in & kick-ass) & the fact that she is such a beautiful young actress. Carrietta ""Carrie"" N. White in the book & in both film adaptations she was a very homely looking & quite shy girl.I also would like to mention that I was expecting a more violent prom massacre, but sadly it was sub-par. Earlier, I mentioned many were advertising this as a more ""true to the novel"" representation of the film. That being said, throughout all of this; the ending was what was gonna be the deal breaker for me were the filmmakers going to go by the book's true ending or was it going to rehash DePalma?The answer is a little of both but more-so DePalma. 90% of the film is a more modernized carbon copy of the 1976 Version of the film. Which is sad, cause King's book had an epic finale that the filmmakers could've brought us (THE FANS) a true horror film for this century, sadly it fell flat.I do although wanna say on a positive note: Portia Doubleday played a fantastic bitch & Julianne Moore did an amazing job at channeling Piper Laurie.I rate this movie: 2 of 5 Buckets of Pig's Blood. Worth a rent, if you are interested.",Carrie
188,MikeWright75,Awful,1,16 January 2014,"This remake was very disappointing, and highlights how you cannot mend something that isn't broken. The original movie was fast paced, character orientated with a style and mood unique to that movie. It managed to capture Carrie's isolation, her fear and shyness, her tentative reaching out for normality. This was a fiasco of poorly paced, poorly characterised, vacuous and grossly miscast mish mash of baloney.For starters, the casting was dire. We have Carrie, a beautiful pouting nubile girl who no red blooded male in his right mind is going avoid like the plague. Her mother, slightly loopy but not enough to make us fear for Carrie's life. The evil Chris, who has about as much character and charisma as a plate of cold fries.... need I go on? Each character was just a pale ghost of the original, and nurtured not one ounce of sympathy or connection from the viewer. The final denouement, which had a hell of a lot to live up to, was disappointing in the extreme and barely worth watching. I felt cheated after seeing this movie. But I can only blame myself for even going there. The original is a masterpiece of film making - a classic that cannot be bettered. Leave it alone.",Carrie
189,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,A very worthy remake.,8,18 October 2013,"We should all know the rundown by now...Carrie is the remake of the  1976 cult classic flick by the same name, which was based on the famous  Stephen King novel. In the '76 movie, Sissy Spacek plays the outcast  teen-aged girl, abused by her classmates in school and by her mother at  home, until she discovers her psychic powers...then all hell breaks  loose. It's a classic revenge tale, and the original movie was good  enough to earn Spacek an Oscar.   Know this: the 2013 version isn't a direct remake of the '76 movie.  While it does feel like a loving homage to the older flick, it actually  stays closer to the book in terms of plot, with some modern touches  perfectly sprinkled in, allowing Carrie White to feel right at home in  2013.   Now know this: This movie is good. Very good.  Julianne Moore takes us to a very creepy place as Margaret White, and  Chloë Grace Moretz SHINES as Carrie, proving that she's got more up her  acting sleeves than Hit-Girl. By the time you get to the end of this  movie, even though you know damn well what's going to happen...you WANT  the prom to go smoothly. You WANT Carrie to be happy, and you HOPE that  none of those terrible things actually happen. You're in Carrie's  corner the whole way.  And when revenge time comes along, it's done with a purpose. Special  effects get dabbed in here and there, but never overdone. (Slo-mo makes  one scene sooo much more deliciously satisfying...) Although I'll say  that it feels like there may have been a scene or two that didn't make  the final edit, and you can really tell where that scene was...a bit  sloppy on that editing there...  Carrie does the source material justice. Welcome to our generation, Ms.  Carrie White.  4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.",Carrie
190,kxok630,Yet another unnecessary hack remake,2,23 October 2013,"Other than to steal money from you, this film is useless. It's the same old stale money-grab formula: a pale remake where some devoid-of-talent hack decides to ""re-imagine"" someone's else's creative work, and the predictable result is one of soon-forgotten cinematic dumpster garbage. Carrie may put a hex on these remake oafs, and Steven King should sue them as well for trashing his work so badly. The memorable and complex character that was tragically thrust into an evil circumstance that she couldn't understand and certainly could not control with bloody results, has now been tossed at us as some cell-phone texting half-wit who probably can't even spell her own name. About the scariest she gets is when she makes ""OMG"" goggle faces at a guy she likes. All of the Gothic references and artistic devices so brilliantly utilized in the original are absent in this mockery of the original.The acting is a joke; a cast that includes proved actors is wasted on a hackneyed script that tries to generate scares. It only garners ridicule and laughter from the audience. I blame the director for condemning this cast to failure with his lack of vision; he doesn't give them anything to do beyond arguing, screaming, and running around. You learn nothing about the characters, other than bad-teen and village idiot clichés tossed in at random.There are some cheap ""jump out"" scares and plenty of bloodbath exaggerations designed to keep you from falling asleep, but that's about as close as this mangled mess will get to horror movie entertainment.",Carrie
191,JohnnyWeissmuller,Carrie,5,25 October 2015,"In Kimberly Pierce's adaptation of the Stephen King novel, which was first brought to the big screen quite brilliantly by Brian De Palma, in 1976, the talented Chloe Grace Moretz takes the lead role as Carrie White, with Julianne Moore in the role of her overbearing and religious obsessed mother. Story-wise, this version doesn't veer far from De Palma's film (or the novel), but it lacks the operatic oeuvre and strokes of creativity that marked the 1976 film. Instead, an uneven tone is struck from the offset, with Moretz able to convince as being naive, but not the social oddity or pitiful-looking figure personified by Sissy Spacek. Conversely, Moore is too full-on by half as the mother, yet never seems to have the upper hand on Carrie. Unlike her cruel and taunting classmates who think nothing of filming Carrie on their mobile phones when she has her first period in the gym showers. Scenes that Pierce handles well, as she does later in the film when Carrie is at the prom. There's a warmth here and an affection for the character, despite the inevitable. Although, most of the secondary characters are strictly one- dimensional, to such a degree that, the blistering finale doesn't strike with the same fire of Dr Palma's film. Here, Carrie's abilities are more akin to superpowers, whilst her Sadakoesque contortions serve to detract from her real inner turmoil. And with the absence of a great score, not to mention some creativity amiss as the film ends, Carrie ends up as a film that may appease those unaware of the original, but won't do much for more seasoned horror fans. Which is a pity, because I expected more of this film. And certainly hoped it would be better than your typical spate of remakes. And to some extent, it is. But that's more to the value of Chloe Moretz, who has huge potential and will absolutely go on to better things.",Carrie
192,champjohnson29,I'm on the fence with this fence!,6,18 October 2013,"I definitely can appreciate the original film. Sissy Spacek was amazing as Carrie but I think the remake is definitely better. The performances were definitely elevated, the story was explored more and characters were more defined but I'm still on the fence as to how much I liked this film.First and foremost, Julianne Moore is so creepy in this film. She was cast perfectly and every time she was in a scene, she commanded the screen. That scene at the laundry mat....oh yes!!! Chloe Grace Moretz is an awesome actress to still be so young in the game. Even when she's not speaking, her expressions and reactions are awesome. I just love her. Also, now that technology has evolved, the effects in the movie were great. It was awesome seeing them let 'Carrie' do more with her powers and explore more of those iconic events that happened in the original. Also, the actress that played the teacher was awesome as well. I wish there were more teachers like her character.Even though this movie had some good parts, it also had it's flaws. I'm not very big on remakes and reboots. I feel like if you do a remake, don't just shoot it the same way, add some parts and make it your own. There were some new parts in it but I just wanted more from the film. I left feeling kind of empty. I enjoyed everything Kimberly Pierce attempted, but she should have took farther. The climax was too short. This was an opportunity to make the ending scenes at the prom, on the street and at the house more epic and more adrenaline but it was just the same scenes with cooler effects. Nice to look at but I've seen it before. Audiences want more from films like these. You can't build up to this climactic scene and then only allow it to be fifteen to twenty minutes.Lastly, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM! I don't even know why the original movie is considered a horror because nothing about the movie is scary. I have never been scared. It's just suspenseful. If anyone gets scared by the original or the remake, you're a weirdo. Would I recommend it? Yes but only if you are a fan of the book and original movie because you will definitely appreciate the enhancements and the performances from the actors. But, NO, if you're expecting a horror!",Carrie
193,epiceffectss,Very good remake,8,9 March 2015,"For once a cracking remake. Only just saw this as initially thought it was going to be the same old. OK , so great acting , the story is the same as original ( never thought the story was that great in original ) so this actually came out as better in my opinion due to it being redone with good effx , better actors and better camera work. Not sure what else to say , if you know the original it's the same story. The girl who plays Carrie was good , she's prettier than original girl , and you do feel for her. I really enjoyed it , maybe because I thought it was going to be a poor remake that actually helped my viewing experience. These oldies are hard to remake and do well , I loved the dawn of the dead remake as that was another iconic piece and its hard to pull it off, so due to the skill of keeping the story the same and not messing with that , doing a good cast and good pacing of the film I will award this film an impressive 8 out of 10 points .",Carrie
194,westfield-john,Carrie remade? This girl is too sweet!,4,8 January 2014,"Chloë Grace Moretz, woah, this would be the first 16 year old gal I would admit to had a crush on. Not because of this remake, nor her name, but her sweetness. C'mon, no one can make this gorgeous young woman play a role like this, being a evil telepathic freak, and completely avoid her from having a steady smile on through the whole movie, because she just became a freakin teen star lately! Where is the sense in making a remake of a horror picture movie like this at all? In fact, the better FX today, we learn. And her rampage was visually very stunning, indeed, but not really horrifying. Chloe would be booked out for the rest of her teenage life for doing so at every school ball, just because it would be so much fun. But horror, no. News sadly proof better horror stories lately. And what about Julianne Moore? Well, the way she was playing hard on her daughter, carrie, I wouldn't buy this at all. She was just so stereotype, I am glad she didn't completely switch out of her role and turned out as FBI detective. Her distressed way of acting and the whacky wardrobe were not a real substitute for a professional performance. We all remember the bitching good times we had with our parents, they were slapping on our arses for sure, not for money, but with this god-given conviction. Both actresses leave an impression as like they weren't prepared good enough, trying to figure out the destructive and profane game between mother and daughter. As both roles are essential for Carrie, the movie didn't go beyond what we already have seen in the original, and now we know we don't have to laugh at Sissy Spacek anymore, actually now we know she was doing very well. But one good thing this remake does have. I went back to the original movie on IMDb in order to rate it a 9/10! Forgot that. The remake earned a 4/10.",Carrie
195,weasl-729-310682,Worth A Watch,7,12 March 2015,"I'm not a fan of remakes, but I'm a huge fan of Stephen King, and also of Julianne Moore.I own scores of his works in books, VHS and DVD, including the book and the original rendition on film of this story from 1976.""The Stand"" is currently my favorite story in the world, but I'm reading ""Under the Dome,"" and friends who've read it say that it just might replace ""The Stand"" as tops. I've read ""The Stand"" five times, and each time I do, I'm still practically breathless at the deep effect on me by the end. I also own the DVD, and have watched that at least half a dozen times. I wasn't surprised at FEMA's and the New Orlean's PD's (gunning down unarmed folks trying to escape from hell on a bridge) response to Hurricane Katrina after my familiarity with Mr. King's story of apocalypse.Is the remake ever as good? Well no, but this was a very solid effort, and brings the story more into current times. I will say that this update makes it even more unbelievable that Carrie could have been unaware of menstruation.I like both movie versions of this great story a lot, while preferring the 1976 original. That said, this 2013 remake is definitely worth your time. Masterful stories are worth retelling.I just don't like this ending as well. One of the few jump scares I can tolerate is the one in the 1976 version with Carrie's corpse reaching out of the grave. It gets me every time.",Carrie
196,doofuspoofus,Not the right Star,5,26 October 2013,"I saw this movie opening night and finally I'm getting around to writing a review. I will sum it up by saying this movie could have been better without Chloe Grace Moretz. That sounds like i don't like her. Let me explain. She is a talented actress indeed and has a unique beauty but just because you're a talented actress doesn't mean a role is meant for you. I hate to see this.There's a difference between bad casting and wrongfully casting an actor. Bad casting is what you see often in low budget films riddled with over-actors. This is an example of wrongfully casting an actor. While an actor may be talented they aren't what you would call ""born to play this part"" like Sissy Spaceck was.The same thing happened with Kristen Stewart in Twilight. Did she grow into the part? yes. Was she the perfect cast? In my opinion no. Anyway the movie was filmed very well and Julianne Moore is fun to watch. Chloe Grace Moretz basically ruined the prom scenes with her interpretation. The whole idea is supposed to be that Carrie loses control of her powers and young Chole definitely appears to be controlling her powers which i very much hated. She's also trying too hard to look awkward as opposed to coming off that way.I love the girl to death-her role in Let me in was in my opinion done much better than the actress in the Swedish version but I can name a couple of actresses just off the top of my head that would've been better for Carrie. The Fanning's for example. Dakota or Elle. I'm also not a huge fan of Chloe's look. She didn't look plain Jane enough and not to sound superficial at all but the actress for Carrie should have been thinner. Simply just to add to the frailty of the character like Sissy it just makes the character look more awkward which is perfect.To sum up watch it and enjoy the story it's not a bad film but does not measure up at all to the original.",Carrie
197,db-beurylaw,Violates my 7 rules of remaking a movie,2,25 October 2013,"I hate remakes. Nearly every single one is inferior to the original. The only reason the studios make them is cold hard cash. So I, once again present the seven rules of when a movie should be remade: Rule Number One: Never. They never remake a failure. The original was good and sometimes great. So why do it again? This is the opposite of creative. Apply the same activity to any other medium. Let say song writing. You write a song that is note for note, word for word, just like a well known hit. When your friends say you're just copied another song, you say its a ""remake"". Rule Number Two: Remake a movie when the original film and every copy, DVD, VHS Laser disk and every other medium has been destroyed in the very same fire and Western civilization will be destitute without a version of this film. That never happens. Rule Number Three: The film is based on a book, play TV show that was a classic and somehow the original failed to capture the greatness and we really need to see a good rendition. Rule Number Four: The original was the type that needed modern technology and effects and when the movie was made, the science was just not up to par. Rule Number five is similar. The original was made in black and white because color was too expensive back in the 40s, and the movie would be much better in color Rule Number six: The original has become dated. Made at another time and things have changed so much that watching the original is a pointless experience. The old horror movies fall in this category. 1930s Frankenstein is just not scary. Rule Number Seven: The original stars some reprehensible jerk like OJ Simpson or Adam Sandler. Turning to this movie it is word for word like the original. But every case member pales in comparison to the original. Sissy Spacek is worlds better than Chloe Grace Moretz. Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, John Travolta, William Katt, and Nancy Allen, all better. Moretz is too cute and in no way creepy. Didn't believe for a minute that she was an outcast, more like very popular. This film is just a money grab! The original is still available. So is the book",Carrie

This other movie is a soulless teen horror. The production is good but whoever did the casting for this remake probably ruined the movie on purpose: the characters are dull to a ridiculous extent and the chemistry between them is artificial in a cringy way. This movie lacks all that made Carrie a cult movie.Thank God they have been able to put Julianne Moore in it, which is the only reason it might make sense to withstand this act of vandalism.One last note: whoever picks which movie ""deserves"" the remake treatment, should aim lower. Maybe pick something that wasn't too great in the first place and make it better- like they did with The Town That Dreaded Sundown (probably the best horror remake ever?)",Carrie
199,Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos,Payback is B*tch!,7,15 December 2013,"The reimagining of the classic horror tale written by Stephen King was awesome! I watched the movie yesterday (14 December 2013) and it blow my mind. Carrie White is a lonely, shy, girl who lives with her deeply religious mother and going through some really hard times during her last year in high-school.Chloë Grace Moretz's acting was simple amazing! She's one of the best teen actors i have ever seen. She was no irritating at all and from the beginning of the movie 'till the end of it she shows you how is really to be Carrie White. When her mother is near you can feel her doubt, when she's next to classmates you can feel her fear and when she discovers her powers you can feel her joy.When her classmates pushed her too far in the school prom she just F*CKED THEM! You can just watch the movie for the last 20 minutes when Carrie unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town. The special effects in this scene were marvelous and believe me if you watch the movie you will also enjoy Carrie killing half of her school population (The death scenes are really clever).Conclusion: The movie takes a golden 8 by me because it promised something and kept that promise... I-KNOW-HER-NAME!",Carrie
200,Eightiesjunkie,"Not the worst remake I've ever seen, but certainly not the best either!",5,18 January 2014,"When I first saw the trailer to this film, I honestly was excited. It looked pretty good, and despite the fact that I've always been a huge fan of the 1976 original film, I thought I'd wanna give it a shot. Remakes don't always have to automatically suck. When they're good, they're great. When they suck, they suck hard! This movie was different though, It wasn't garbage, but it wasn't spectacular either. Take the original 1976 version, recast it, and set it in modern times, and basically you have this movie. Nothing new is brought to the table, and although the cast do their best, they can't compete with the original's cast. But even if you turned a blind eye to the cast, the lack of atmosphere, and the incredibly lame CG pig's blood, (Ugh!) The film still falls flat on its face. There's no build up and there are no surprises. Halfway into the film you're fully aware of the extent of Carrie's powers, and because of this, there's little to no excitement in the climactic prom scene. That's the nail, in this movie's coffin. It's a better film than the made-for-TV ""Carrie"" but that's really not saying much. If you've got two hours to kill, give it a watch, but if you want the better movie, stick with the original.",Carrie
201,joeywyss,"Capable Cast let down by Director, Script & bean counters.",3,14 February 2014,"This is another example of where they got it right the first time and if it ain't broke don't fix it. As more remakes of Brian De Palma films creep out I am more impressed by his talents. As it started off, I had high hopes for the film because clearly the script was following the original movie (if not the book), almost as an word for word homage. The updates to bring it current seemed subtle and deft, as in the cyber- bullying, and were effective. But clearly the director started damping down the talent. While Moretz, Greer, and Henley are certainly no strangers to roles where a little scenery shredding is required to flesh out the characters effectively, they are choke-collared here. Only Greer's gym teacher has any spice at all, but unfortunately she's thrown up against leaden wooden performances that I blame squarely on the director. I couldn't wait for Moore's take versus the Piper Laurie original napalm as the mother, but she is given nothing here. They give her the same dialog but clearly pour cold water on where she's allowed to go, which is ridiculous considering the dialog itself. The mother is a lunatic, and trying to cement that with the little cutting scene at the cleaners is just plain stupid. As an multi-nominated Oscar actress, she could have blown the roof off. Moretz is not allowed to show any of the depth a horribly abused child (by her mother and classmates), and not allowed to convey any of the madness that was given in the current script. Greer's sarcastic coach and Henley's bumbling principal could have provided some desperately needed humor, but they are flattened out here although they both are trying their best. I think there's some work left on the cutting room floor that would have fleshed out their performances dramatically. And then, things begin to veer wildly off course. The director clearly didn't understand the book, and by taking liberties with the prom scene and movie ending , he didn't understand the characters. Turning Carrie into a vengeful witch wielding her power like a sledgehammer instead of a victim who has been pushed into madness and can no longer control her power ruins the whole point. Changing the fate of the gym teacher ruins the whole point, just like in Cujo. Changing the final battle scenes between the Whites including the absolutely moronic twist for Sue and the mysterious boulders out of nowhere throws the movie completely off the rails and over the shark. Top it off with a ludicrous committee investigation and cemetery scene in a limp tepid attempt for franchise potential and the movie is officially a travesty. Thumbs up to the cast, thumbs down to director and script.",Carrie

As a millennial I watched the original Carrie as a teenager and although the story was good, the movie hadn't aged well.For a modern remake, this is pretty decent! The Carrie, Carrie's mum and Sue act their roles well, with good character development. Set against a modern high school backdrop.Entertaining, good psychological thriller. In today's age, I would not call this a horror. And maybe that's why some people are disappointed. It's a pure reboot, with no new edge. If you didn't grow up watching the original Carrie movie, you'll probably enjoy this one more.",Carrie
203,malpasc-391-915380,"A fair, if not necessary remake",6,21 October 2019,"Firstly, most of us know the original film of Carrie from 1976, and know the plot through and through pretty much. This 2013 remake doesn't really change much, other than update the methods used to bully Carrie - specifically filming the part where Carrie experiences her first period and thinking she's dying being recorded by her bullies and uploaded to the internet by head mean girl Chris Hargensen.Other than that the general story doesn't really deviate from the original. Carrie is still a dowdily dressed, shy, teen whose life is made a misery by her bible bashing religious zealot mother and her peers at school who take pleasure in mocking the innocent outsider she is.Good things about this film - Julianne Moore's portrayal of Margaret White seems much more convincing to me than that of Piper Laurie's from the 1976 movie. Where Laurie's came across (to me) as over the top, like some kind of evangelist on speed, Moore's portrayal is genuinely disturbing - someone who clearly has mental stability issues as well as incredibly strong religious zealotry.Chloe Grace Moretz is great in the role, but as others have said, almost too pretty. Whereas Sissy Spacek managed to look almost other wordly and not conventionally 'pretty' unlike her school peers, Chloe Grace Moretz just looks like an incredibly pretty girl being made to wear some dowdy clothes. Her transformation for the prom could have been taken from Never Been Kissed where all the dorky girl with glasses and dungarees had to do was untie her hair and take her glasses off. However, that aside, unlike the 1976 version, all the kids in the school at least look high school age, whereas in the original they all look like fully grown adults.To 'that' scene, which everyone remembers - even with some pretty decent CGI effects, the 2013 version doesn't really add anything. The same thing happens - Carrie has a lovely time, the Prom King and Queen vote is rigged, she and Tommy Ross win and she ends up with a bucket of pigs blood all over her before her powers of telekinesis kick into overdrive and she takes revenge. The revenge scene is pretty well executed, certainly more graphic than the original, but it doesn't do anything more.All in all this version of Carrie is a fairly competent remake, with a few genuine moments of sympathy for the lead character, but there are almost no surprises. If the original had never been made this would still be a C grade horror flick - something to catch on a streaming service of your choice on a rainy day, but not a must-see.",Carrie
204,ada-767-840531,what was this?,2,13 January 2014,"I want to start this review by saying that i am a huge Stephen Kings' fan. Love his books and his writing style. And now about the film-2013 Carrie-didn't like it at all. Where to start-first what's the point of making a remake of de palmas' movie when you can't bring anything new except maybe better graphics?For me this was yet another pointless remake from many, and those started to pile up a lot. Second thing i hated about this new movie is actually the lead actress,girl who played Carrie-she hasn't convinced me at all.Carrie should be creepy,odd looking-don't know something else from what we got. I also missed creepy atmosphere overall in the new movie-in this movie you'll got dull atmosphere and one-dimensional characters. I thought that acting was joke and most of the scenes were boring there was no chemistry between characters. This is possibly the worst adaptation of Kings' book.",Carrie
205,marais-alexander,"A competent director, an excellent performance, and slick direction save this from being just another remake",8,30 October 2013,"It says it all above. Chloe Grace Moretz is a remarkable performer. Her Carrie performance was excellent. That being said, even someone that talented can't save a movie that's square. And while Kimberly Pierce is on board with boys don't cry under her belt, the film is great with the drama and well...lacks on the horror. The epic prom scene that I felt all the well- choreographed drama was leading up to should have been a bit more bombastic. Sadly it wasn't. They play it safe pretty much and thus makes you think, ""WTF? Isn't this the critical moment where we should be shocked?!"" While Carrie sails over the prom room, snapping electrical cables like bloodthirsty eels, there is no hardcore violence - which I think a movie with this kind of horror fable calls for. A few bloodless deaths and poof! It's all over. Not good. This is somewhat redeemed by a long awaited death scene of Carrie's mortal enemy, Chris (Portia Doubleday) whose seething and sadistic bullying gone too far makes you hate her like no other. Carrie's mother (Julianne Moore) an unethical religious zealot is like Paddington compared to her. All in all watch the movie if you're a Chloe Grace fan, but otherwise pass until it's on DVD. The prom scene is way too disappointing - it would have been mint if they had used the slo-mo effect from Dredd to convey all the pain Carrie inflicts on everyone.",Carrie
206,annablair-19191,Bland and Without Bite,4,6 March 2019,"Kimberly Pierce is no slouch in the directing department, so I must wonder what went wrong here. For starters, Miss. Pierce is under the impression that Carrie - a coming of age horror story by Stephen King - is a ""superhero origin story."" Perhaps that hurts the film more than any studio tampering.Sure, there are moments here and there where Pierce and co. do dig back into King's source material instead of the classic De Palma film to give this movie at least a few reasons for existing, but it's simply not enough to break out from under the shadow of the De Palma film.Yes, we get a much more satisfying demise for Billy and Chris, Chris' father makes a welcome appearance, and we get to witness Margaret giving birth to Carrie, but that's honestly all we're given that goes back to the King novel and not the De Palma film. Literally every other sequence apes the De Palma film every chance it can get, asking the question ""why even bother?""Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore play Carrie and her psychotic mother, Margaret, about as wildly different from King's source material and De Palma's film as you can get and who could blame them? It's natural for every actor to want to put their own stamp on a role, but different isn't always better. In fact, Moretz, already impossibly miscast due to her cheerleader good looks (which they don't really do much to downplay), plays the title character as far too independent and with a bit more backbone than the character was originally written. An admirable choice, but it throws off the balance between Carrie and Margaret. Moore underplays Margaret's crazed rantings and ravings (probably due to fear of coming off as over the top), but this choice renders her character far less imposing and less of a psychotic live wire than a severely depressed woman. Once again, it's an admirable, interesting choice, but it robs the film of its bite.Things come to a head in the prom sequence where there are some decently effective additions of gore such as a boy getting crushed by a set of bleachers and two twins being trampled to death by a sea of stilettos all the while Moretz waves her hands around like a crazed magician. Some of it works and some of it doesn't.All in all, this Carrie seems too gun shy to really break away from its influences completely, leaving seeds of interesting ideas that don't gel with the material from the source material that they've kept. In fact, it seems as if there are a few different movies in her struggling to get out. It's far from the worst remake you'll ever see, but it doesn't really give itself a decent enough reason for existing.",Carrie
207,neil-shrubb,Laughable,6,25 April 2021,"Naff, unnecessary but still fun with ropey effects & some terrible acting. It says based on the book, but it's obviously not, & besides the added social media, it's such a faithful remake of DePalmas vision, I was half expecting to see split screen during the prom scene. Not sure this was necessary.",Carrie
208,liveaholic,I guess they thought the world needed this?,4,7 October 2020,"I mean... I'll be honest. If you'd never heard of or knew of ""Carrie"" before, you'd probably enjoy this reboot. But the original Carrie is a horror classic. I actually just watched the ORIGINAL for the first time 2 years ago, and expected it to be dated/corny, but it holds up surprisingly well. Literally the only reason to remake this movie is for a cash-grab from a newer generation who apparently don't know anything about movies before the turn of the century.Also not a huge fan of the casting of Chloë Grace Moretz. She's quite pretty to be a supposed social outcast. Someone like Saoirse Ronan (who would have been 18 or 19 at the time of filming), would have fit the Carrie ""look/feel"" a lot better, in my opinion.In summary, an enjoyable enough horror film if you have no prior knowledge of anything about the book, previous film, or general plot. Regardless, just do yourself a favor and watch the original.",Carrie
209,jmsfan,Fine version/remake (whichever you want),8,23 October 2013,"After seeing this today, I finally came away with an appreciation for a remake of a classic (at least the 1976 version is considered classic by many fans) movie. To start off, I'm not knocking the original with Sissy Spacek at all. I really enjoyed it. Sissy gave a Oscar-nominated performance as the very much put-upon telekinetic misfit who gets her revenge. That said, I disagree very much with those who say that Chloe Grace Moretz didn't act the part of Carrie very well. In fact, I give her the edge over Sissy. Sissy was fine throughout and then at the end, she mostly gives a bug-eyed mannequin performance while destroying the school. Moretz shows every bit of angst, pain, humiliation, and anger on her face when the final trick is pulled on her. And she doesn't just stand on stage, she acts out the destruction with gestures, facial contortions and seemingly choreographed movements, which all add up to a very creepy grand finale. This is not to skip over what went before. It's still very much in line with De Palma's movie (I haven't read the King book in years to compare) and covers the same basic ground but the big difference here is that the filmmakers obviously tried and succeeded to make a quality remake. Julianne Moore is very tense and disturbing as Margaret White, Carrie's quasi-religious mother (I say this because Carrie knows more of the Bible than her mother) and you believe her as a potential agent of harm to Carrie. I do have to give props to the special effects department, especially with Carrie destroying the car (and passengers) of two of her tormentors (this scene is played out slowly, with nuance and great tension), with the car slowly being crunched together with Carrie's will while one of the passengers watches helplessly. Back to Chloe Moretz---she is about the age of Carrie in the novel (that much of the book I remember) rather than the mid-20's that Spacek was in while playing Carrie. Therefore, for me, she's immediately more believable, and she shows the tension of being an outcast at school very well, with scared jerks when someone touches her on the shoulder, with distrustful sidelong looks at whispering students, and with hateful looks at herself in the bathroom mirror, before a student finally convinces her of her beauty. After that, she comes alive as a thriving human being, if only for a few hours of being accepted. Again, I love both movies but give this one the edge. Very much worth seeing at the theaters.",Carrie
210,mannly,Not As Good As The Original But Some Parts Superior,7,4 January 2019,"I hated the first half an hour, constantly comparing it to the original, and by the middle it became okay...Sissy Spacek is far superior and I have no idea why anyone thought this remake was needed...However I found this completely worth the watch when it comes to the prom turning sour. The way Chloe plays Carrie as a dark conductor I found astonishingly beautiful in it's own way. That section is too short though. If there is a director's cut it would be so worth it. Gave me goosebumps. So... Not the original, but wow... Highlights.",Carrie
211,pomeu-63850,Improves on the original,6,24 July 2021,"Sometimes movies are held in high regard because other people tell you it should be so. Case in point, the 1976 version of Carrie.This 2013 version improves on many things that the original doesn't get right. Like the budget, special effects, better dialogue (yes, much better), better insight into the characters, making Margaret White into a human being, instead of a walking stereotype, so on. It helps that this version was directed by a woman, no doubt. As well as 40 years of hindsight.Chloë isn't Sissy, of course, and in fact, she's a tad too perfect to sell the awkward outcast convincingly, but at least she was a teenager and not in her late 20's, like the previous actresses.The Prom scene here is really the biggest improvement. In the original they spend about 3 min on the destruction of the high school and really couldn't afford to do much more. In this version we get to see Carrie really rage, even if now she can fly, weld, create earthquakes, and do quick ultrasounds. Thanks for spoiling the gender reveal, Care-bear. This time she does so by employing some serious X-Men hand gestures. Elizabeth Olson and Halle Berry would be so proud.Neither of these movies are truly great, but I found this 2nd attempt easier to watch.",Carrie
212,Houmatt,Get ready for disappointment!,4,18 October 2013,"Yeah, I was quite disappointed with this film. Allow me to explain...and this comes with a spoiler warning.When I first heard this was being done, I just shook my head. Because you had a 1976 film version, a made-for-TV film version (which was serving as, believe it or not, a pilot for an ongoing series), and a stage musical(!). So why are we going back to this particular well? Then I heard the simply adorable Chloe Moretz was cast in the title role. It did not feel right for me at all, primarily because of Sissy Spacek, who played the role in the 1976 version at the age of 26. But, Carrie White, chronologically speaking, was 16 in King's novel. As is Moretz. Okay. And then I heard this film would be ""closer to King's novel."" So I was sold.But as I watched the opening credits I noticed the following: ""Screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa."" Up to this point, I had only seen a single writing credit for the latter. And Cohen wrote the 1976 film. So why was it there? And then I found out: There are several elements lifted from the earlier film version, to the point I am certain the WGA required Cohen be given credit. This was making it less an adaptation of King's novel, and more of a remake of a 37-year-old film. So much for the promise of a closer adaptation.But then it gets worse. Much, much worse. You get your first hint of foreboding when Carrie tells her mother where she got her power from. I was left thinking, um..how do you know this? But then we get to the prom. The video slide show made no sense to me whatsoever. In fact, I am sure it was placed there as a setup for what happens later, which is lame, lame, lame. But I digress.Telekinesis is the ability to move and/or manipulate objects with your mind. And what is Carrie doing? After she locks her mother in a room by way of super-heating a sliding bolt, the climax shows her levitating and hovering over a floor, cracking open a stretch of road by stomping on it, stopping a car from hitting her by creating a force field or shield, and for good measure, letting another girl know she is pregnant AND the baby's gender! Carrie doesn't merely have ""the power"". She is a full-on mutant! I was half expecting Agent Coulson or Professor Xavier to make a cameo in a post-credit scene or something.I do not expect King to like this film. I know I didn't. Wait for it on Redbox if you feel you must watch this waste.",Carrie
213,lone-wolf-007,Carrie: The Jean Grey teen years,5,1 November 2013,"Another horror remake that for the most part was not needed. Sure the story has been updated but it lacks what makes the original a classic. Chloe Grace Mortez is miscast as the shy awkward teen Carrie White. Yeah she is a good actress but she just isn't believable in the role. I never bought she would have been picked on and bullied by the popular girls. Julianne Moore is the saving grace as the mother as I felt she did the part justice. Problem is she can only carry the movie so far. With the original there was a slow build to Carrie discovering and using her powers but here she uses her powers left and right with just a minimum of her learning about it.It could have been a series of scenes in an X Men movie. She moves this that and the other and by the time we get to the prom there is no surprise. Which brings me to the films biggest fault. They drop the ball completely on the prom scene. If they had upped the violence and made her really lose it then maybe the payoff would have been better. Here she has full conscious of who she attacks and kills or hurts. The original had Carrie pushed to her brink and her powers unleashed a hellish fury. That isn't present here at all. I was quite disappointed with the final results. Way over the top CG effects just hamper down the mess even more.Sure the main tormentor gets hers but that after Carrie lifts the car she and her boyfriend are in and lets it rip into a gas station. As you watch the scene Carrie does it all while using her arms as a catalyst for the telekinesis just as Jean Grey might have done. Its what I kept thinking as I watched the movie and it just didn't seem to fit. Is this remake terrible? No, but its a mixed bag. Watered down for today's teen audience and masquerading as an R movie. Stick with the original '76 version instead. That version is quite superior.",Carrie
214,victor_sianghio_ii,The original is still the best,7,3 November 2013,"I am in the middle with this movie. First, the main antagonist, was trying too hard, often overshadowing the main character. Second, the fast-paced transition from scene to scene made the movie almost unrecognizable from the original. What's unique, however, besides the special effects was the number of unknown actors that made the film not overwhelmingly glamorized. The movie was cleverly cast, again except for the main antagonist. Sorry.Watch with discretion.",Carrie
215,David_Habert,A brilliant remake of a Steven King Classic,8,8 December 2013,"When I first heard about a remake of Carrie. I gotta admit to me red flags went up in the air. Because I though no one could possibly top Brian De Palma version.Not true, because this new version takes this classic to a new generation of horror fans and another surprising twist at the end of the film which no one in the original came up with.The only thing which I wasn't too pleased about was the scene in the first five minutes where Carrie's mum gave birth to her and then was about to stab the baby with a pair of scissors. Where I'm from that scene could have pushed that movie from being 15 rated to 18 and you can imagine that a lot of people would have lodge a lot of complaints because of it. I know I would.I also thought that Chloë Grace Moretz who played Carrie seemed like a strange choice to play her. Most of her previous roles have been like heroines. So this was a polar opposite to what she normally does. But credit is where credits due. She did a brilliant job, well done Chloë.One person I felt really carried the role of Margaret White (Julianne Moore) really did Piper Laurie original role. A great deal of justice, well done Julianne.The rest of the cast also excelled themselves including Gabriella Wilde who played Sue and Portia Doubleday who played Chris. The original stars of the original movie would have been very pleased with the result.So which version do I think is better the 1976 version or this one. Tough choice, because both have merits. But the main difference which I think sets this one apart is the scene where Carrie gets angry after pigs blood gets tipped on her. That scene in this movie, I feel was better than the original and it landed a few surprises because the gym teacher is saved by Carrie and is ""transported"" out of harms way. In the original she gets killed.Chris's and Billy's death scene is a lot more graphic than the original and with all honesty both these two idiots had that coming.The fight scene where her mother tries to kill Carrie. I felt was better in the original, that's not to say that this version didn't do it justice. I just felt that the 1976 version is slightly better.The biggest surprise was almost at the end where Sue tries to save Carrie and in the end Carrie saves her because Sue was pregnant with a baby girl. If I didn't know any better, I think Carrie past on a gift to Sue's baby. That being the gift of Telekinesis.There was a TV version in 2002, but it didn't quite do it for me.But to say which version was better. I couldn't say because I believe there as good as each other. All in all, congratulations to this remake, for once they got it right. The cast from both the 1976 and 2013 version did a fantastic job.Whatever you do, don't ever slate this remake. It's (excuse the pun) ""Bloody"" good.",Carrie
216,theburrus1,Good adaptation and update of the original Stephen King story!,7,8 January 2014,"First, I will say, anyone who's seen the 1976 version of ""Carrie"", if you are a huge fan of that original one or just know it very well, you should sit that film aside completely and just watch this one as if the old Carrie never was made, then you will enjoy it more. I actually liked this adaption a little more than the first and older movie so well known. This movie being so much more modern, was able to focus more on Carrie's telekinetic power much more, and of course utilizing modern side effects and techniques when filming, and so I found this was one huge plus of this film. And the director and crew do it just to the right degree, through most of the movie. But what is really excellent about this newer version is they stick very close to the story; it never tries to outdo the '76 movie in any way, ever, that I could find. It starts and remains modest but pushes along to its climactic ending in a fun yet accurate way. And it is that very climax that Carrie is know most for.The actors were all good in their parts, particularly the lead characters. Some of the teeny high school scenes are a little too overdone but that happens very little so it doesn't hinder this movie too much in the process. Julianne Moore plays a good part as Carrie's mother, and I imagine for Julianne, it gave her a change of pace from her previous roles in other films. And the choreography was good, and enough attention to detail was given so the prom scene, and a few others beforehand in the movie work and so it is all this that makes it a small gem among 2013 horror films.Finally, its strongest point and what most who know the story will anticipate, is the climactic ending, as I did. I watched closely at some significant events and still despite the newer actors and ability to achieve effects not previously available in 1976, this movie uses the effects in just enough amount to keep the viewer in suspense and wonder, especially in the end parts. Basically, it does due justice to the novel by Stephen King, only from a modernized point of view.And so given all that, this would rank higher in the ranks among other remakes or refresher films in recent history I think. Give it a look if you were wondering about any of these points I have made, and if you weren't otherwise. Or just go in with normal expectations and you'll like this movie.",Carrie
217,sifc33,just plain ole terribad,3,23 October 2013,"Sorry, but this is a pretty terrible movie. Judy Greer does a good job as being the cool coach and compassionate teacher ""mother figure"" and of course J.Moore can do no wrong... so with their two solid performances I grant this a 3star. However, that's where it stops with me.I saw this movie, in a pretty decent sized theater and it was a good Saturday night crowd, in a metropolitain city. Even with that, the crowd seemed disengaged and everyone kinda left, as we did, kinda hoo hum what's for dinner? The girl who played Carrie, bless her heart, it was ssssooooo overacted that it seemed forced and contrived. I can imagine it must be intimidating to be in the same shot as J.Moore, but still it was pretty sad. She seems like a nice girl, and I hate to sound critical but it was just ""forced."" Really nothing can take away from the original, and most of all the ending to the original is so brilliant it could never be topped.",Carrie
218,starlimitz2,Leave it Alone,7,13 May 2014,"Carrie is as Carrie does. Though it is nice to see how someone would update a movie such as this and put social networks, cell phones, and other higher technology to good use, it's still just Carrie. The movie is well done, and even though it starts her off with her telekinetic powers earlier in the film, it is still rather slow to get going. That being said, it is a little more faithful to the source material than the original movie rendition in some areas, and it was nice to see that different perspective. Again, though, it is still Carrie, and the first film was good enough. Other than that, though, it was thoroughly entertaining. They picked a very good Carrie in Moretz, but Julianne Moore stole the show with her perspective on the mother. She was playing the crazy mother like a real natural, and she even had her very own horror aspect by herself. The characters overall were a definite plus. They went with the high school stereotypes, but not overtly so. Despite being an unneeded remake (that Hollywood seems so dead set on shelling out these days), it was a good movie in its own right and brought about a good new aspect.",Carrie
219,lmt_is_me,Horrible Remake,3,5 January 2014,"First the acting ability of Chloe and Julianne are fine. This is a story that need to be reproduced. For me, watching this was not a joy. Not enough time spent on character development. I found the original spent more time on Carrie and her ""issues"". It is always difficult for a remake to live up to the original. I think the background talent was also at a higher level than this one. John Travolta, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Brian Depalma's wife (Nancy Allen)were head and shoulders about this troop. So one thing that did bug me is the blood drop. It should only occur once and not 3 or 4 times which it did in this movie. It was not slow-motioned but we say it occur too many times. The additional scene from the bathroom earlier is not required. Why people need to feel the need to demean someone else is beyond me. We saw the image earlier, no need to put it out there again.",Carrie
220,Adarsh_Kumar_Singh,An OK viewing,5,11 January 2014,"First of all, you have to compare this with the old one. After all it is not an original story, its just a remake ......The total character building was the strongest point in the old Carrie to get to the climax. This one lacks totally.The teacher, the bad girl, the good girl and the boy, all those who make Carrie happen are not that strong. It would have been better to get more expression out of them.The otherwise ""crowd"" who were at the receiving end were not at all introduced. They should have been given something more than just boos and whose, smiles and smirks .....Still ...One of the three things that keeps this "" NEW "" Carrie movie going is Julianne Moore. Moore does what she does best. Act her part.Second of them is of course Chloë Grace Moretz, she seems to have a grasp of horror/thriller dark movies. She did well here .... . Will love to see her in an outright romantic comedy soon. Third of them is the choreography/cinematography. They kept it at just the required level.I am giving this a solid 5, just for trying and coming half-way .....",Carrie
221,Phillip_Tomasso,Netflix Movie Review: Carrie (2013),6,2 October 2014,"**Plot Spoilers**I will never forget reading Stephen King's Carrie., nor will I ever forget watching the movie Carrie (1976). I am not a fan of remakes, or reboots. I find them pointless when the original is indisputably a classic. I will admit when I received the email from Netflix that the 2013 rendition of Carrie was on line, I was a little excited, maybe it was because it is October, and there a few horror movies worth the watch. I think everyone knows the synopsis of the film (novel). Carrie White may have been unfashionable and unpopular, but she had a gift. Carrie could make things move by concentrating on them. A candle would fall. A door would lock. This was her power and her sin. Then, an act of kindness, as spontaneous as the vicious taunts of her classmates, offered Carrie a chance to be a normal and go to her senior prom. But another act--of ferocious cruelty--turned her gift into a weapon of horror and destruction that her classmates would never forget.It is a simple plot, but so packed full with depth and underlying themes that are so uncomplicated they are genius. I was prepared to dislike the remake. The original had Sissy Spacek as Carrie, and Piper Laurie as Margaret White, Carrie's mother. The two carried the movie. Their acting is what made the movie such a success. Laurie was amazing. Creepy. I had nightmares from her performance as a religious heretic, a Bible thumping fanatic. Spacek was so timid and shy, so pathetic and weak. I could never imagine anyone else playing either role nearly as well. I remember trying to watch other movies with Spacek, and just couldn't do it. She scared me. Even though she was never the evil in the story. In the remake, Julianne Moore is top billed, portraying the role of Margaret White, while Chloe Grace Moretz landed the part of Carrie. Unfortunately, but showing great diversity, Moore nailed the role of Margaret White. Normally an attractive woman, Moore has forever scared me. She managed to capture and add to the role, paying complete homage to Piper Laurie's performance. Moretz had big shoes to fill. At times she came very close. Mostly she missed. Just missed. Moretz is far too pretty, far too cute to garnish much sympathy or empathy. This is not meant to imply Spacek was not an attractive woman, however, when she was Carrie, she was Carrie! Now, with that said, Moretz did elicit emotions in me while watching the movie. I felt for her character when she talked with the gym teacher about being asked to prom, and when Tommy Ross actually asked her to prom. Moretz did portray sense of sweet innocence that made me like her. All I meant was, she is no Sissy Spacek when it comes to this . . . legendary and iconic role. (Think Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka . . . close, but no cigar). Some pluses include seeing more into Margaret White. Just a bit more of her as a sick person. It added to the story. It added to the horror. The high morals gym teacher, Mrs. Desjardin (Miss Collins in the original), played by Judy Greer, was well done. She kept the performance true to the original, played by Betty Buckley. The roles of Sue and Tommy Ross, Chris, Billy Nolan, and Norma were non-eventful in both movies and, sadly, hardly worth the mention.The remake is more relevant. I feel like the reboot serves a purpose. The incorporation of cell phones, the internet and YouTube were essential to draw in teen viewers. It made the movie appeal to a wide audience. It exposed a new generation of Stephen King and horror fans to a classic in a way that would make sense, and was relate-able. For that, I understand and applaud the new rendition. The special effects were extreme, a bit thick and poured on, but did assist in the prom scene. The climax, when Carrie returns home after prom to tell her mother she was right, that they all laughed at her, was as graphic and impacting and sad, and troubling as it was the first time I saw it in the original. The women did an amazing job at recapturing that . . . magic. The overall sense of loss and dread, and emptiness were complete. If I were seeing the movie for the first time, I'd have easily given it 5 Stars. However, there is no way I can evaluate this version of Carrie without comparing it to THE Carrie. And for that, I am forced to give the movie 6 Stars. And this may be a spoiler, but I was kind of upset that Carrie's hand did not shoot up out of the grave in the final scene. I waited for it. Never happened. (Might be why I am giving it a 6 instead of a 7). Phillip Tomasso Author of Blood River and Vaccination http://www.philliptomasso.com/",Carrie
222,benjaminryder-45940,Prom is Overrated Anyway,6,22 April 2019,"If you're the 3rd filmed version of a classic Stephen King story (there was a flop musical adaptation, too), you'd better be bringing something more to the table than replacing some landlines with iPhones and throwing around references to Snapchat and YouTube. Sadly, this Carrie retelling seems hesitant to break away from the shadow of the De Palma film to exist on its own terms. Yet, it also does borrow a few lines, characterizations, and sequences from King's novel that were either omitted or changed for De Palma's film. It ends up feeling like an odd Frankenstein creation that struggles to find its footing with Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore's performances suffering as a result.Moretz doesn't have the pathetic helplessness than Spacek (or even Angela Bettis in the TV movie version) had, which makes her seem far too confident as Carrie. Because of this, we never feel the need to take care of her or hope she gets out of her lousy home and social status. With the way Moretz plays her, you feel like you just want to tell her to stick it out until she graduates and she'll probably be able to move away and make some other friends somewhere else.To make matters worse, Moore plays Carrie's mother, Margaret, as the truly helpless one. She's a shy, introverted, and quiet wallflower you'd never notice on a crowded street. It's a far cry from the Margaret in King's novel and De Palma's film. She's still religious, yes, but gone is the hysterical fervor and outbursts of rage and violence, which makes audiences perk up on the edge of their seats whenever she enters a room. With Moore's performance, Margaret comes across as more of a pathetic victim than Carrie.There's some snazzy bursts of clever effects in the climactic prom sequence, but a whole lot of goofy ones as well. A slightly more protracted demise for Chris and Billy is at least semi-satisfying (and perhaps one of the only improvements over previous re-tellings). It's all wrapped up by a somber ending (no jump scares this time) that's ruined a loud rock song.",Carrie
223,barry-steers,Boring Remake of Classic,5,24 January 2014,When people write 'reimagining' in the movie blurb upon release then I expect a twist or different nuance to the original film. I want a clever retelling that makes you think you are watching a completely new film even if some scenes or characters are familiar. Alas this film does not do that at all. Why try and emulate the same original film? Although it was not a 100% scene for scene rehash it was so damn close to the original movie that you ask yourself on why bother to remake it at all. I fully understand that it's based upon the book but this was successfully translated to movie previously so the only way forward if you really have the need to retell it is to create a whole new story. This was not a 'reimagining' in the slightest but a lazy rip off instead. To anyone who's not seen either movie then I suggest to see the original one instead. You will feel far more fulfilled than with this tepid clone.,Carrie
224,blades_n_stone,odd girl: The BlOOdEning,4,27 January 2014,"So I finally get around to watching Carrie redux. and I have to say. Not impressed. Granted I have had bowel problems that had a more satisfying finish and better tension. This review will be sarcastic and have some spoilers.I liked the beginning. Good actors, the right look for a modern odd girl out. Heck I went to school with some girls that looked just like her and had the same fundamental/mental upbringing. they were good people with odd parents. But this movie.. what the hell? What year is it placed in? it looks like 1988, 1997, 2004 and 2014 had a baby? Where are the public schools with Olympic sized pools? You mean there are still schools out there where teachers can slap, touch and say profanity to students without loosing their jobs? you can ban people from prom and its a thing? So mid way through the film the movie starts to tank. bad. The video of her freaking out over her period,(again what school still makes high schoolers shower in a big open room?) posted to a fake Facebook account( cause cyberbully) but Carrie has no computer. she can barely type. So this is not even a thing to her. so the mean girl and her thug boyfriend get set to ruin her night...because? The blood drop that gets it all started sets us up for a bad cgi fun time. Carrie becomes a blood soaked super villein killing without warring and becoming a high school version of the Phoenix from x men. Then we get to see people crushed, burned, electrocuted, and trampled to death, we get to see automotive safety glass work like plate glass and that in an emergency no one calls the cops until the whole school is on fire. It starts good then leaves you feeling put off and disgusted. I can get the same feeling with 10$ at taco bell, and with taco bell I don't get: noticeable(bad)CGI, Julianne Moore in her most forgettable and unnoticeable roll ever, A timeline that can't be placed,(this movie shakes its way through more decades then Michel J Fox) A slaughter scene that makes Carrie a villain equal to any school shooter.(she just kills anyone she can lay eyes on, how is she an anti hero? the main girl who harassed her was not even in the first group she killed.)I like violent movies.I don't like seeing a kid killing people because she is different. So when the time to watch Carrie 2013 comes up. just say nope and watch something good.",Carrie
225,GrowMagicBeans,Carrie – For those that have seen the original 1976 version,5,2 December 2013,"Okay, before I go into what may come across as a rant (my apologies) I will say that this movie as a stand alone, teenage, popcorn guzzling flick was enjoyable enough in its own right. It's probably a little unfair to hold too much judgment on a piece of work that will inevitably stand in the shadow of a classic. Nevertheless I think, unless a reworking can bring something new to the screen, as the Coen Brothers' managed with their reworking of True Grit where they went back to embrace the rich language of the original novel, then one is leaving their movie open to scrutiny. I suppose the justification was that with the rise of digital technology, a reworking of Carrie would allow for dizzying new special effects of which the original producers could only ever have dreamt! But whereby the Coen Brothers shed their rework of the sentimentality of romantic cinema narrative, the director Kimberly Peirce, seemed to embed this reworking of Carrie with Hollywood cliché. And here pretty much starts my rant... I'm not going to say that Chloë Grace Moretz did a bad job as Carrie. I think however, she was poorly cast. All the head tilting or nervous shuffling in the world was never going to convince me that this pretty girl was the reclusive, shy, plain character Carrie was suppose to be. Indeed, it seemed absurd when the gym teacher suggested Carrie use a little lipstick or red blush to bring forward features of her face as if she needed it. In the original, the face matched the script and this allowed for a Princess Diaries style transformation to which our superficial, but good natured Tommy could discover a new allure. In this latest version the characters' motives come across as quite two dimensional. Whereas in the 1976 original, there was a fudged line between the 'good' and the 'bad' girls. Indeed, I remember the first time I watched the original, it was not entirely clear to me precisely who was in on what, or who was playing who. We suspected the character Sue Snell was having a crisis of conscience, but in the early stages of the movie, she might just have been playing a part in bad girl Chris Hargensen elaborate plan to get back at Carrie. Both girls used their own methods of feminine persuasion to coax their boyfriends along and so the 'good' girl was at least a little manipulative in her own way. In this reworking, the lines of allegiance are quickly drawn, the shades of personality are black and white and the viewer has little doubt about who is on who's side. It really bugs me that in modern movies often every detail is spelt out to the viewer and I think that new audiences watching this version today will miss out on the subtle, and thus more suspenseful, qualities of the original.I mentioned above that perhaps the urge to recreate this classic in a modern form was brought about with greater visual effect capabilities, and to some extent I guess they expanded on the original. The greater destruction to not just the school hall, but the town in general helped create a travesty close to epic proportions which the original could only hint at. However, although some of the visual effects of the original may now seem a little dated perhaps (the flying hose!), still I felt De Palma managed more with the visual effects at his disposal, using split screens, slow motion and screeching sound effects, to create an eerie sense of atmosphere. For all the hi-tech effects of today, I felt the last scenes still lacked the same creepy climax that De Palma captured in his finale ...but that's just my take.However, scenes like where Carrie brakes the mirror with her mind, then moves the shards, seemed like showing off visual effects for the sake of it, rather than adding any meaningful context to the narrative. Just because they could do something visually, doesn't necessarily mean that they should! Indeed, I thought the new movie's script missed the point of Carrie's power, at times giving the character too much control over it. What made the original such a physiological scare is the fact that her prowess with the power seemed to come only when she was humiliated, like it was tapped from a deep rage or frustration and so it was also indiscriminate in the people it hurt - including those who tried to help her. But here, Peirce allows the movie to be infused with sickening Hollywood sentimentality and not only does Carrie choose to save the likes of the gym teacher, but one last meeting is written into the script with the overly sweet natured Sue, just to let us know that Carrie's character is not altogether past redemption. Why? It was much more scary to think that Sue's good intentions could never be reconciled, that she was left with a haunting nightmare, a grim arm clutching up from the grave.But lets not be too harsh on Kimberly Peirce: De Palma was one of the Greats of his day in an era where directors had the artistic licence to be a little more experimental. I love many movies from the 70's because they purposely set out to challenge the expectations of the cinema narrative of their time. This latest version of Carrie is a 'safe' retelling aimed at a teen market, perhaps with the suits that be forcing a hand, hedging their bets off the legacy and success of its predecessor. Not all together a terrible movie which would, perhaps, if it were not a remake, seem 'okay' in that generic fashion of main stream cinema today. If you love the original, you'll probably tut tut at times. If you have a friend yet to see either version, advise them to watch the 1976 version first!",Carrie
226,snakes3992,Good remake,8,27 August 2014,"This remake was not needed, it was only made for money, but overall I have to admit it's a decent remake, it's not as good as the original, but it's better than the TV mini-series that Stephen King made. Chole Grace Moretz does a good job as Carrie, her acting may not be Oscar worthy, but she does a pretty good job. She does seem to do the character done pretty well, of course the film is not well done, they're some problems, the part where she gets bullied, feels a little meh at times, because they're kind of generic, the prom scene feel like I'm watching High School Musical, yeah it feels really generic, and clichéd, also the scenes where she is learning to use her powers look nice, but some of it is done with CGI, which doesn't feel real. Despite the problems it has, it's still a good movie, because the ending still does have a good effort to be creepy. Overall it's decent but it can't beat the original, because the original is still a classic, and really scary.",Carrie
227,s-klose,This one didn't need to be made,7,16 March 2014,"A remake of the 1976 horror film by Brian de Palma. This time the daughter is played by the much too young Chloe Grace Moretz with an over the top Julianne Moore as the overbearing and over religious mother. Of course the effects are better than almost 40 years ago, then again, there is way less gore in this one. Essentially a remake that serves no purpose. What I liked about it though , was that there were actually some of the ""cool"" kids that were nice to her, which was pretty nice touch. Also they include social media in this movie. It might be interesting to watch the original again for a comparison. Although I hate bullying and don't wanna see that again soon, which was a bit harsher in this one. Still I say, give it chance. Don't blind buy though. Give it a rent. That's enough for now.",Carrie
228,ben_jarmin_4,It's alright,6,10 March 2018,"It's alright, not too much to say really. The acting is okay, Chloe (the woman who plays Carrie) does a pretty good job. The let down is the direction, some pretty ""made for DVD bargain bucket"" scenes in this. The CGI is just, well, Nintendo 64, and they love to put a lot of it in. The bucket of blood scene is over done, literally replayed from six angles and by the third it's already boring.",Carrie
229,Machiavelli84,See the 1976 version (or just read the book),4,20 February 2015,"Recently my wife and I got into a bit of a ""Carrie"" craze. She had just finished reading the original Stephen King book, whereas I hadn't; I had seen the 1976 film version as a young'n, whereas she hadn't. With these two factors, we decided to watch the 2013 version, and provide input into how faithful it was to the book, as well as how it held up to the 1976 version.I've often heard that this was a ""reimagining"" of the original story, but I found this to be both true and untrue. There are many lines lifted directly from the book that weren't in the 1976 version...however, there are many changes and elements which weren't in the book but were in the original film. Two examples: Sue is there at the prom and is kicked out by Ms. Desjardin (in the book, she went to the prom after the crap hit the fan); after attacking her with a knife, Carrie's mother is crucified to the wall (in the book, her heart was slowed down). With this in mind, I found it harder and harder NOT to compare this film to the 1976 original. Like the newer ""Planet of the Apes,"" all the blatant references to the first film compelled me to do more and more comparing.The acting, for the most part, is fairly decent. Chloë Moretz, who plays the title role, does a pretty good job playing an awkward shy teen, though at the same time she looks TOO good to be Carrie; I found it hard to believe that, even if she was made fun of, absolutely NO ONE would EVER be attracted to her. In the 1976 one, Sissy Spacek isn't ugly, but she looks more like a girl who would be made fun in school. Most of the minor characters do a decent job in their roles, including Gabriella Wilde as Sue and Ansel Elgort as Tommy. Julianne Moore's performance as Carrie's mother, however, presents a couple of problems. For one, she doesn't play her as the aggressive psycho that she was in the book, and as she was portrayed in the 1976 version. I got the vibe that they were trying to make the audience more sympathetic towards Margaret, or perhaps add more of a bond between her and Carrie, but considering the story portrays her as a secondary villain, it just doesn't work. It doesn't help that Moore's performance is mediocre (I kept seeing her character from ""The Lost World"", only with religious lingo thrown in), and it can't hold up to Piper Laurie's Oscar nominated performance in the original film.Another problem with this film is, like so many horror remakes that have come out recently, any sense of suspense or mood is ruined with unnecessary blood and gore. The biggest offender is one scene where Margaret is encountered by Sue's mother and proceeds to stab herself in the leg with a needle. Why? I don't know. It just sort of happens, and then the movie continues without another thought.Perhaps the biggest thing that ruined the movie was the famous ""Black Prom"" sequence. For one, Carrie doesn't just look at things like she did in the book and the 1976 version - instead, Chloë Moretz waves her hands about and gets a stupid grin on her face. I don't know if this was Miss Moretz's idea or the director's, but either way it hurts the scene. My wife and I actually started LAUGHING at it, and we dubbed her ""Evil Elsa."" The whole point of Carrie's powers was that it was telekinesis; that is, she was using her mind as an extension of her desires and wants, in the same manner (but not in conjunction with) the way we use our body. Also, it doesn't come across as the big massacre it was in the book, and as it was in the 1976 film: it looks more like Carrie kills off the bullies who were mean to her, then just leaves. Nothing about the scene stands out, except Chloë Moretz's goofy faces and hand waving, which actually hurt it.If you want to know how much the original excels as a film, then let me tell how our ""Carrie"" night ended. The Black Prom scene in the 2013 version had absolutely no affect on my wife; yet after we watched this movie, I went on YouTube and showed her the Black Prom sequence in the 1976 original, and she became TERRIFIED. I don't scare quite as easily as her, but even I felt chills go up my spine as Sissy Spacek looked around the room with those unfeeling bug eyes of her. The use of sound, the use of split screen, and the build up of the chaos just made it work. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the 1976 version is the BEST FILM EVER, but as an interpretation of the story it holds up well after all these years. Furthermore, there's a good reason why the Black Prom sequence is still one of the most remembered from all horror films.I won't say this is the worst remake ever, but as a film it was just disappointing. I've read other reviews that have said there were missed opportunities to reinterpret the story in a successful, unique way, and I wholeheartedly agree. If you want to see a movie about the Stephen King book, just stick with the 1976 one.",Carrie

The cinematography and the visuals in this movie make your head blown and the acting of the lead actress literally diserve 10 out of 10 rating.

Love the acting of everyone and somewhat I've sympathy with the Carrie White as she is literally put her 100% in this movie to give us guilty pleasure of horror and thriller.",Carrie
231,Migaish,Don't compare to the original!!!,8,17 October 2020,"It's a great modern retelling of this horror classic. Nothing can beat the original and it's charm, with the amazing Sissy Spacek.
But this is isn't the original nor is it trying to be. It is it's own unique film that takes the story into a modern day premise, and most of the themes are still relevant today.
I actually find I like the music and cinematography much more than the original. And I like the use of modern technology in this film, it's done in a way that feels natural.
This is a good horror film!",Carrie
232,dannib89,Loved It !!,8,3 January 2014,"A great remake of the original 1976 Carrie. The only reason I rated it 9 and not 10 was due to her levitating out of the building (which I thought was a little ridiculous) and her discovering her powers before the prom, I felt like this took away a little bit from the ending which I thought should have been more dramatic. otherwise it was an overall great movie!! A reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz), a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother (Julianne Moore), who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom. Based on the best-selling novel by Stephen King, Carrie is directed by Kimberly Peirce with a screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.",Carrie
233,itxtroy,needed to focus on the little things to make it better than the original,7,9 June 2020,"Felt like few dialogs and scenes needed to be in detail or a bit longer to make the viewers feel of the situation!

234,coastin_on_a_dream,"An adequate, fun horror film",7,23 January 2014,"I've heard some very mixed things about this movie. Some people have said this is a great remake, and others have said that it is terrible. I just saw it and here's my 2 cents.I've seen the original Carrie 1976 movie twice, although I have never read the Stephen King book.If you compare this movie to the 1976 movie, it's a good remake. Probably not as good, but they did a great job at modernizing the movie. I've seen a few interviews by the filmmakers for this version, and they said that it is not a remake but rather a re-imagining. This is incorrect. This is a straight up remake and it follows the original film very closely. Not much story is added to the original premise. But like I said, it's a good update.Now, if you look at this movie as a stand alone film, it's quite good. It's not particularly scary, but it is a little creepy/disturbing at times. But it's more so fun and entertaining.I also liked how this movie emphasized the bullying a lot more than the original. Teen suicide and bullying is still a very prominent thing happening, and social media is often used to take that bullying to new heights. I'm glad this movie addressed this and featured it. The bullying in this movie is aggressive and vicious, and it's easy to see how anybody would completely lose it if they were in Carrie's shoes.I thought that Chloe Grace Moretz, despite the criticism she is receiving, did a great job playing Carrie. In the 1976 version, Carrie was someone that you pitied, But Ms. Moretz gave the character more layers, so you not only pitied her, but you actually empathized with her.Julianne Moore did well playing Carrie's mother, delivering a creepy performance. A really surprise was Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy. He had a lot of great chemistry with Moretz, and the scenes with Tommy and Carrie were actually very sweet and nice.Portia Doubleday plays the malicious Chris Hargensen and she did a great job. This girl was truly evil in this movie and she played the part well. And her character gets what's coming to her in an epic showdown at the end with Carrie.The prom massacre had a good impact on me, because the buildup was strong. This was really the final straw and Carrie just finally snaps and looses all control. It's a fun scene, but probably not as spellbinding or disturbing as in the original film.Overall, it's fun and entertaining, and manages to be a good remake. The actors are game. I give it a solid 7/10. Could have been better if they didn't follow the original movie as closely and tried to make it more original. But still a good movie.",Carrie
235,TomShortell,Surprised me very much,4,4 January 2014,"I tell you. I absolutely adore the original and I'm very hazy about remakes because they never seem to do the job for me or even worse ruin the franchise. When the trailer was released I was extremely doubtful on wanting to see this because although she is a great actor - Chloe Moretz didn't seem like the type of girl to play the original Sissy Spacek because she was absolutely brilliant. Boy was I sure wrong about this. It had such a great feel to the horrible film and although it did just bounce of the storyline a lot and there were only several changes that where not involved in the original, I really enjoyed it. The bits that I thought where very far fetched was the CGI because it was trying too hard and sometimes it just didn't work. My favourite scene will have to be the Prom night because it generally was a massacre. They went completely over the top with the gore and it worked very well. The deaths scenes where different and brilliant as they shown the upgrade of what productions can do these days. The emotions where really shown through Carrie in this version and you could completely understand where she was coming from when being embarrassed. I don't know if anyone else though this but I could understand the Carrie character a lot more through Chloe rather than Sissy. If you are a fan of the original and enjoy almost all of it. Then certainly go see this remake because it really identifies the pain and emotion of the Carrie character this time and maybe from watching this version you can go back and watch the original to create a bit more of an understanding of the Carrie character.",Carrie
236,sanjna-polamarasetty-869-692642,Watch just for Chloe Grace Moretz,6,18 January 2014,"Despite being a huge fan of the horror genre, there have been several Stephan King's 'classics' that I never quite got the appeal of. I feel like he has the ideas, but gets a little lost with the writing, and ends up quickly wrapping it all up at the end. The original 'Carrie' gave me this vibe when I first watched it. Carrie is a one woman (or rather a newly-turned-woman') show. The focus always remains on our main character, Carrie. At first I did think that Chloe Grace Moretz might be a little too adorable and normal to pull off the weird, awkward Carrie, but she did an excellent job. If any aspect of the film had to be given any credit, it would be her. She completely carried the film on her shoulders. As much as Peirce also played her part in getting the audience to sympathize and empathize with Carrie, just as soon as she needed us to be threatened by her. Other than Moretz who was just excellent and once again proved after her 'Let Me In' (2010) that she can be an excellent spooky horror actress as quickly as she can slip into a skin-tight leather outfit and kick-ass, 'Carrie' was an average flick. Worth watching once if you were a fan of the original or horror in general. And I do realize I did not mention Julianne Moore, and I did so for good reason. She had absolutely no impact on anything in the film whatsoever, and her face doesn't even come to mind when recollecting the film.",Carrie

Carrie is excellent movie with awesome effects everybody will enjoy Carrie. Years 12 and up will probably be fine to this. it is rated R for Bloody Violence Disturbing Images Sexual content and language. this movie should be in the Oscars for special effects Best leading actress best supporting actress and best screenplay. Julianne Moore is a excellent as carries mom. Metro Goldwyn Mayer and Screen Gems make the best horror remake ever in movie history of remakes. Go to your closet and pray! Go to your closet and pray!

238,lee_ross_1996,They'll all laugh at you...if you don't want this film.,8,6 December 2013,"After watching Carrie tonight I can honestly say that it is almost as good as the original, if not better. I can honestly say that once again Carrie White is depicted as this innocent girl, but this time in the form of Chloë Grace Moretz, a sixteen-year-old actress, who is mature for her age; which differs from Sissy Spacek, who was 26 at the time of release. Moretz definitely played the role with finesse, making the audience sympathise with her until the very end (even after her rage); Julianne Moore stars as the role of Margaret White, Carrie's mother, she portrays her mother flawlessly, making her look like she has a ""screw loose"", as presented in the Stephen King novel and the '76 version. From start to finish I was engaged (especially in the prom scene). The prom scene is the one that has the most impact on the audience, leaving you in shock, after seeing this newly transformed, shy and beautiful girl turns sour, with justification of course, but let's not give that away. For those of you that have seen the '76 version, you'll of course know the film plot already, there are only a few minor changes in the plot and even the film, but the main one is the use of CGI, and the prom scene is full of it, but makes Carrie's rage look even more furious without overusing it. Overall, this is definitely a must see for all supernatural lovers – 8/10.",Carrie

When it came to her discovering her powers it did seem a bit more like watching Matilda then a horror. The graphics of watching the books flying around where just poor. As for the massacre at the prom was just over acted by the lead roll. Where Sissy Spacek was able to portray the evil from her eyes, with Chloe there was a lot of arm flaying and twisting, and a lot of poor visual effects. The only person who came up trumps is carries mother, still able to portray the bible craziness and pure terror at Carries powers very well. not a bad film on its own, but simply does not stand up to the 1976 original.",Carrie
241,santiagonunez16,"This isn't horror, it's a lifetime movie of the week with cussing!",1,19 October 2013,"I saw the original Carrie at the drive in when I was a kid and was looking forward to the re-make. Unfortunately, this was a huge let down of a horror film. Can you even call it horror? Where the original felt creepy, this was just plain slow and dramatic. The scares have been replaced with emotional and dramatic scenes of child abuse. Carrie is bullied, her mother abuses her, and she's coming of age except her puberty is telekinesis, with a little revenge. Had this been a drama, it might work better instead of hiding behind the image of an all out horror film. The magic of the original is gone. If you want to see a scary movie, see the original, if you want to see the drama version of Carrie and be bored out your mind, then check this out! Personally, I like scary movies to be scary and thrilling. This is neither, maybe next time they'll get a remake right.",Carrie

I mean this is Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass they should have had someone who looked alone depressed and lonely- they should of picked someone who is not a good actress but a great actress, someone with experience and looks like a Carrie. the one who would have been perfect for this role if I had been the casting director, Saoirse Ronan.The other actors who played the fellow students were even worse- overall I would rather watch Twilight saga then watch this again.",Carrie
243,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,Carrie,2,17 May 2014,"For some odd reason, people find the original 1976 version of CARRIE to be some landmark in horror cinema. But in reality, it is just an average story of a girl learning how to become a woman while trying to control her supernatural powers and her psycho mother. Then she kills her entire high school in a ten minute scene. After my second viewing, I would give the 1976 a C due to how effortless and anti-climatic. Call me crazy for not loving it, but if you're one of those people who find it flawless, I blame you just as much as I blame the director of the 2014 version for burdening our time with this god-awful movie.CARRIE 2014 is basically a screen-by-screen recap of the original, as though we had forgotten how it all happened. But this time, we're forced to suffer though excruciating performances by annoying teenagers who look way too old to be in high school, and OH! how could I forget, the addition of technological influence on the youth. I am tired of seeing films giving the same type of unbacked and misunderstanding viewpoint on the lives of teenagers. If there's one movie that cannot grasp the reality of teenage lives, it is this movie and CYBERBULLY. There really is not anything to say about this movie other than it is a recap of the original, which really pisses me off because it is basically just taking the ideas of another individual in order to make more money for themselves.The sole positive aspect of this movie is the performance by Julianne Moore, who is great at portraying a mentally disturbed bible thumper. But it really is a pity that she cannot be taken serious enough with a screenplay that comes across as though it was written by a couple of two year olds. GRADE: D-",Carrie

I haven't seen the original and probably won't to be honest, so I'm rating this movie based on this version alone. Loved Chloe and Julianne, but the other actors were the downside of the movie IMO, they were a bit cheesy and over did things a bit. Julianne Moore was amazing - she literally scared and disturbed me. Hers is probably the creepiest character I think I've EVER come across. Ugh just thinking about her is making me shiver. Odd I guess, considering Carrie is supposed to be the ""horror"" character... but maybe its knowing that there are actual nutso's like Moore's character out there in the world that makes her the scary one...",Carrie
245,amiratootoonchi,Just horrible,4,2 November 2019,"Just watched this and wow was it ever disappointing. The acting was horrible. The way it was written was boring. I understand wanting to take an older movie and wanting to bring it into the present, but a movie like this should have stayed in its original form. Just because there have been major advances in special effects doesn't mean that they will make a movie good; this movie is an example of that. Carrie is a movie that could have been really good modernizing it, but this attempt fell way short. The original is the way to go if you want to enjoy a horror movie, this one is just not scarey whatsoever. Dis I mention the acting sucks?",Carrie
246,MoviesAreLife93,A satisfying and maturely-handled remake,7,5 January 2014,"People often criticize this movie for being ""unnecessary"" when, in fact, it isn't unnecessary by any means. The original Carrie was released in 1976 - almost forty years ago. It's not as if Hollywood jumped the gun too soon and greedily called for a low-budget remake at the first opportunity. The story deserves to be brought back to the surface for a new version. No...This remake was handled with maturity and care. It was even more similar to Stephen King's novel than the 1976 adaptation. For example, Carrie's birth was a particularly detailed scene in the book that wasn't shown in the 1976 version.I have seen the original adaptation multiple times, and have read the book twice. So, I went into this movie knowing what to expect. Then again...who wouldn't? Many people are complaining that this movie is weak because they knew about the prom scene before seeing the movie itself, but honestly, who would have not expected that scene? We watch Psycho and expect the shower scene; we watch King Kong and expect the airplane scene; and we watch Titanic and expect the iceberg scene. We KNEW how this remake of Carrie was going to end.Modernizing the story was a risk worth taking. It should not be considered a flaw. We could relate more to the characters if they are adapted to our generation. It would be fair to do so, considering that the 1976 version was correlated to the generation at that time.The performances were very decent all around. Julianne Moore's performance as Margaret White was very satisfying, and quite chilling. Chloe Grace Moretz's portrayed Carrie's shy well, but lacked in her fulfilling the awkward and misfit side of Carrie. This is one aspect of this movie that lacks in comparison to the original - Carrie should not be displayed as attractive and shy. Rather, she should be portrayed as a loner, socially awkward, timid, and more or less ugly girl.I enjoyed this version of Carrie very much, just as much as I loved the original version, and this is coming from a huge Stephen King fan. I want to see his legendary works handled with care, as it was done here. The special effects are not overdone. The plot is well-paced. The main characters are well-developed. Most importantly, however, this movie does justice to its legendary source material.",Carrie
247,brianparker-55923,Useless Remake,4,25 October 2020,"CGI replaces more interesting practical effects in this lukewarm adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which had already been adapted for the screen twice and once for the musical stage. This one is easily the worst of the bunch with two miscast leads in Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore. These are two excellent actresses who simply aren't right for their roles. Moretz has none of the vulnerability required for the title characters and seems too strong from the get go and Moore has the exact opposite problem where she's far too vulnerable as Carrie's abusive religious zealot mother, possessing none of the required threat. Some other supporting roles fare much better, but the film eventually turns into a computer effects heavy finale with some inventive moments of gore during the prom massacre, but also several laughable moments like when Carrie levitates out of the burning prom.",Carrie

It was pretty monotoned. The actors were great but the pacing and the script, not so much. Don't think i'll watch it again.",Carrie
249,freeist,Best Carrie movie yet.,8,26 October 2013,"I wrote an original review of this, but after I kept thinking about it for a week, I decided to see it a second time. I'm ready to upgrade my rating and declare I believe this is the best screen adaptation of Stephen King's 1974 novel yet. It surpasses Brian De Palma's film in every way. I don't care what category you're talking about, directing, acting, music, special effects, any category.I'm fan of the original. I saw it thirteen times and had a crush on Sissy Spacek's. Even so, I think that if this version had come out in 1976 and De Palma's came out now (with some adjustments for making special effects better or worse according to the period) this would be considered a classic and De Palma's would be considered ""unnecessary"" and ""pointless."" Personally, I think I would have had a crush on Chloe Grace Moretz.Yes, and I believe in twenty years, this is the version that's going to be remembered and that people will watch it rather than De Palma's. The box office receipts have been disappointing, but I think this version is going to gain stature in hindsight, like John Carpenter's The Thing, like Blade Runner.The plot of Carrie is about a high school outcast, bullied by peers at school and abused at home by a hyper-religious mother. Isolated and uninformed, Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) gets her first period late at 17, and panics. This attracts the ridicule from the girls in her gym class. Her peers get in trouble, then set her up at the prom for the cruelest high school prank in cinematic history. However, the pranksters don't know that Carrie's sexual maturity has brought a side-effect: extreme telekinetic powers.Chloe Grace Moretz seems an odd choice to play Carrie White. The main complaint circulating has been about her looks: she's attractive. Carrie described in King's book emphatically isn't attractive. The choice of Moretz works, in fact, it's inspired. For one thing, she's sixteen and looks younger. Moretz' Carrie is more isolated because of her mother Margaret White (Julianne Moore) and only second due to her classmates. Carrie's socially backward due to a few key years of socialization missed by being home schooled. Unlike De Palma's film, Carrie's also sexually harassed by boys. Moretz shows Carrie's constant anxiety and fear with her body tension, restrained gestures, and fearful eyes. With tight shoulders, wringing hands she looked like a kid who's being extremely bullied at school and expects no help anywhere, especially from home.Moretz is required to do much more than Spacek was in the part. This version requires Carrie to have more emotional range. Added to that, the part is physically more demanding. Carrie does stand up to her mother's horrid religion and paranoia. However, their relationship is more than just abuse, psychosis and bad religion. Beneath the violence and terror, the two actresses manage make tender moments between the two convincing.When it comes to the telekinesis, especially at the prom scene, Moretz has to show it with body movements, which--with any less skill--would have evoked laughter. She goes from innocent and beautiful to menacing and creepy. Her gesticulations drip with power (and blood). She's helped with a great use of CGI special effects. The pulsing of her pupils and blood dripping upward off her arms were breathtaking.In fact, the entire prom scene rocked. Moretz successfully bridges the gulf from likable kid to monster and then to broken child. I believe it was every bit as good as Spacek's, and Spacek got an academy award nomination.The script owes an awful lot to the original, but it makes additions that drastically improve the story and characters. The supporting cast shines in these scenes. Carrie's arch-enemy, Chris (Portia Doubleday) stands out as a seemingly normal girl who's actually a psychopath. Her lack of a conscience challenges another girl Sue (Gabriella Wilde) to prove the sincerity of hers. Sue puts her boyfriend up to taking Carrie to the prom, which is something that practically no high school girl would do. Yet, the film ignore that as Wilde portrays Sue's anguish at her own sacrifice convincingly.The rest of the supporting cast all deserve praise: Alex Russell as Chris' thug boyfriend Billy, Judy Greer as the gym teacher Ms. Dejardin, and a funny performance by Barry Shabaka Henley as the principal.Kim Peirce's directing is fresh, and her perspective on the story is different. The prom scene surpasses the original. She gets good support from a great musical score by Sally Boldt et al. The music doesn't call attention to itself, but at any time, if you listen to it, it's effective.The only thing I found a bit disappointing was the ending. They were in too much of a rush to wind it up after taking their time to turn Carrie into a monster. Interviews, rumors, an aerial shot, and the trailer all suggest there was a lot more to this film that got cut. I hope it's all restored in a later version.",Carrie
250,danhollow,Absolutely Blew Me Away,10,24 October 2013,"I went into this film with low expectations. Low, low, low expectations. I never saw the original Carrie, and I saw little reason to; the story seemed pretty basic and predictable, not to mention unscary. Furthermore, this remake seemed like just another in the never-ending line of crappy horror remakes. I'd seen a couple just that day, the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and the Prom Night remake. Both were awful, Prom Night in particular failed on every level to be believable, likable, or scary. I'd groaned seeing the ads for Carrie. Still, I was in a bit of a blues mood, and gave the movie a shot (with the intention of seeing others later when it disappointed).I was wrong. I was completely wrong. Carrie blew me away. This is the best horror remake by a long shot. The writing has flourishes and insights far beyond the usual drivel of horror films. There is thought and effort put into every word.Furthermore, the actors attach genuine emotional attachment to their lines and performances. These felt like real people with reactions, outbursts, and pride; but also flaws, insecurities, guilt, shame, and even regret. Line by line, scene by scene, they build this movie. A movie populated by real people who illustrate what people like Carrie need to know; the world has bad people, but far more good ones. People who do nice things for strangers, whether it's as small as a tidbit of advice over someone's shoulder or a big sacrifice to give someone one night of acceptance and happiness.The story only seems to improve with an updated setting. Carrie's old-fashioned home life makes her stand out more than ever, and the addition of certain modern-day elements fit perfectly into the character stories. You'll wonder how the original got by without them. It's so exhilarating and realistic that you start to see the cracks in the source material as you're watching it. You see the beautiful place the characters are going, but then it has to follow the story set in stone for Carrie.Among a pretty remarkable cast, Chloe Grace-Moretz and Julianne Moore stand out. Chloe was born to play Carrie. She doesn't fit into the usual Hollywood standard of dolled-up beauty, which becomes all the more evident when you see her classmates. Still, there is a pretty young girl in there, she just needs someone to see it. She plays shy and vulnerable better than any other actress I've ever seen. Furthermore, for all the bragging I hear about Sissy Spacek, most people don't mention she was 27 when she played Carrie. Chloe is 16, the isolation and judgement of high school is still fresh in her mind. As for Julianne Moore, she plays Margaret White with a quiet instability that makes it very clear why Carrie is terrified of her getting involved in anything. This is a woman lost in a world no child should have to endure. Still, she and her daughter have some rather touching moments, and it's clear that for better or worse, Carrie loves her mother.I've been reading a lot of bad reviews for this film, and I just wanted to put my opinion out there, because I went in with serious doubts and instead got a new favorite horror movie. And if I enjoyed it this much without ever seeing the original or reading the book, then I'd say this movie deserves another look.",Carrie
251,ninetails888,You Will Know Her Name,6,18 January 2014,"I'm a big fan of the original Carrie novel written by Stephen King in 1974 and I did enjoy the old Brian de Palma Carrie so when I heard about the re-make happening that starred one of the best young actresses working in Hollywood today, Chloe Grace Moretz, I was excited. Did Kimberly Pierce's Carrie disappoint?I didn't hate the 2013 Carrie, I actually enjoyed myself for the most part. It's not a great film but a decent one. One of the most invalid arguments I'm hearing against this film is that it is unnecessary and I don't think it is. Kimberly Pierce didn't want to remake De Palma's Carrie just for a cash-grab, I think she did it because she knows bullying is a huge issue in modern times and to make the story more accessible to today's modern viewers, Pierce threw in a few talented, popular actors and actresses and made a teen horror film that she thought would draw modern audiences in. I do think the new Carrie is relevant, even if it is not a incredibly well made film.There is no denying there is talent in this cast. Chloe Grace Moretz has proved herself a very versatile actress, taking on roles from the potty- mouthed teen assassin (in Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2) to a lonely vampire (Let Me In) to a young, middle-America girl trying to make it to Las Vegas (Hick) and now to the bullied Carrie White, a very iconic role made so memorable by Sissy Spacek. Moretz has said in interviews that she didn't want to watch the old film in preparation for the new one because she wanted to make her own Carrie character and I think that was a smart choice. She wanted her Carrie to be special and unique. While watching the film, it's hard to get over the fact that you're watching Carrie instead of Chloe Grace Moretz but Moretz obviously tried very hard to disappear into her character and I think a lot of times, she did. Her performance is not one from the best of her career but it's hard to imagine an actress of that age giving a better performance.Julianne Moore creates a delightfully creepy Margaret White and is very good in the film. The ensemble of young actors and actresses is also very good, specifically Gabriella Wilde and Ansel Elgort who both give excellent performances.A problem I had with this Carrie is the lack of intensity in a few scenes. The whole film feels sort of rushed and is very quickly paced. I wish Pierce would have slowed the film down a bit and took more time to explore the character of Carrie more. I wish Pierce would have built upon the character made famous by Spacek in 1976. She didn't but she did build a little upon the character of Margaret White which I was pleased with.The whole film does lack the needed feeling of intensity until the climax at prom which is actually far more gory than expected but I think it works. The intensity is there for at least the prom part which is a huge part of the story.I guess Carrie serves as a sort of guilty pleasure for me. I had fun but it isn't a very well-made film. It's rushed and a lot of times lacks intensity but there are some stellar performances here and I thought the prom scene was handled very well.I give Carrie a B-.www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com",Carrie
252,mariapirelli,Worth a Watch,8,19 August 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and found myself completed absorbed for the whole of it.

Not so much scary as sad at how they all treated her. Well worth a watch.",Carrie
253,jackcummins-56515,More of a Readaption than a Remake,8,21 February 2020,"This remake lacks the brilliance of Brain DePlama's original masterpiece however nevertheless the are definitely worse remakes out there. However, this film feels like less of a remake and make of a retelling of the book. The Black Prom is definitely the best scene in the film because of the satifysing deaths and Moretz's acting abilities. It's complicated to describe this film as it lacks on making the story more of a tragedy by only really killing the bullies and allowing the bystanders to live however when Carrie was murdering her bullies left, right and centre it made me think more about the tragedy of Carrie's life than the original did. That being said, De Plama's adaption of the book is still the suprerior film in terms of quality by far but don't let that put you off this one. It's still good, not horrible but not the originals standards. In terms of the acting, everyone does a good job especially Chloe Grace Moretz who plays a good Carrie however I can't help but think with her strong build and beauty that she could definitely hold her own against those bullies.Overall, a good retelling of the book but not as good as the original.",Carrie
254,dune_3001,See the original,5,24 May 2015,"This review is a little biased. I'm a huge fan of the original Carrie, it's one of my favourite movies of all time. When I heard of the remake, I was a little skeptical. I was wrong, I should have been a LOT skeptical. Chloë Grace Moretz is a fine young actress and everything, but she doesn't give anywhere near the performance Sissy Spacek gave. This movies just lacks the intensity of the original, which built up slowly, gathering speed along the way. Whereas in the remake they hit you over the head with telekinesis abilities and magic, and witches and it takes a lot of tension out of everything.In the 1976 version, Carrie seems like a nice, sweet girl who was dealt a bad hand and you root for her from the start. In this one she comes off as a complete psycho at the end. Even Julienne-freakin-Moore couldn't save this train wreck.One good thing about the remake is that at the end nobody is claiming that an 18 year old girl will just be able to completely forget everything cause she's just young enough for that.",Carrie

256,torfarrells,Carrie: An Excellent Adaption,10,20 October 2013,"I thought Carrie was very well done.Kimberley Pierce (Boys Don't Cry) told the story of Carrie White, with a satisfying, Modern touch. Phones and Social Networking are brought into this adaption. Chris Hargenson (Played by the amazing Portia Doubleday) takes videos of Carrie in the locker room, and posts them online. Later on (SPOILER) during the prom night, the video is played, right after the blood is dropped. I loved the beginning. In the original (don't get me wrong, the original is a masterpiece) they do not show the scene in which Margeret decides to keep Carrie. In this, we see Margeret give a painful birth to Carrie. This is followed by Margeret attempting the stab the baby with scizzors. In the end, she decides to keep Carrie. The CGI was not over the top, I have no idea why people are complaining. I thought that Gabriella Wilde, Judy Greer, Alex Russel, and Portia Doubleday gave performances, I thought were better then the characters of the 1976 DePalma Masterpiece. I am debating over Chloe Grace and Julianne against Sissy and Piper. I thought Chloe Grace gave on outstanding performance. She was (quote) ""mesmerizing"". I also loved Julianne Moore. She was (quote) ""perfect"". They both gave outstanding and truly amazing performances. I feel like Sissy really captured the innocence of Carrie, while Chloe captured the emotional aspect of Carrie. I cannot decide!I was surprised that Judy Greer slapped Carrie in the shower room. Nowadays, a gym teacher cannot do that. Nonetheless, she was great.Overall, a great movie worth seeing!",Carrie
257,Jacobhemphill96,This Was actually pretty damn good,8,3 November 2013,As a fan of the book and the original 1976 film my expectations for this were mixed. But just yesterday I saw this with two friends and loved every minute of it. It is very faithful to the original source material with a few modern takes on the story. There was also a bit more blood . Chloe grace moretz is not my first choice to play carrie but from what I saw she did very well. You feel for her and feel the pain she's going Through and understand why she does what she does in the end. Julianne Moore did especially well as the crazy religious bitch mother. The original was a little silly and over the top but Moore plays it so well it feels like I'm watching it for the first time. The prom scene is straight up awesome and has some very intense death scenes . Overall the film is very good And I highly recommend it.,Carrie
258,tonyjcole94,SOLID remake!,7,11 July 2017,Yeah it was probably unnecessary to do a remake of the film but the film itself was actually great! I think the acting was good on all levels. The mother was creepy as hell . Chloe was great as Carrie . You could actually feel the intensity through her facial expressions . Even the supporting characters had solid acting . It was definitely entertaining and better than other remakes I've seen,Carrie
259,A_Random_Guy_22,Take Sissy Spacek to the prom instead.,4,20 October 2013,"Having followed this film from its initial announcement up to its release, I can assure you it's not at all what we were promised. Several interviews with the cast and crew members claim it to be a more faithful adaptation of its original source; the 1974 novel penned by Stephen King. It's not. No, Screen Gems and MGM's 2013 revamp of 'Carrie' is more akin to that of the 1976 film, which featured numerous changes from the book - all of which are still present here. This is only a minor gripe as its not an issue, per say, I just don't appreciate being misled. On we go.Moretz plays the titular character and, whilst a fantastic young actress, she was definitely lacking something here and her performance is just short of believable. Most of the time, it just came off flat. I said from the get-go she was a miscast, but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt - and she just didn't quite pull it off for me. It would've been advisable to hire someone a tad older with more experience, but I digress.On the completely other hand, Moore delivers an absolutely brilliant performance as Carrie's psychotic mother, Margaret. Fantastically creepy, and while she may be no Piper Laurie (1976's original), her superb portrayal is the best thing in this movie - and one that longs to be in a better film.Let me compare with the original for one second. The 1976 film slowly builds Carrie's powers so when it comes to it, the prom destruction is a complete shock. But here? Oh, no. It was more like watching Matilda than Carrie. Levitating books, humans... you name it. By the time it gets to prom, the extent of her powers are no longer a surprise and it all comes off as rather tame actually. I certainly didn't get any satisfaction from it. They cranked the CGI up to 110, however. In this case, less is definitely more. Director take note.The supporting cast do their best with what they're given, notably Portia Doubleday as Carrie's nemesis Sue, making the film not completely without its merits, but when it comes down to it, 2013's Carrie really just feels like a pale imitation of the 1976 film. It doesn't bring anything new or fresh to the table and it doesn't even feel like it tries to, which I suppose is fine if you've never read the book or seen any of the film adaptations. But if you have, you might be better off taking another visit to that prom.Like going to your own prom and not being crowned anything, there's no real payoff. 4/10.",Carrie
260,acnovo,Hard not to compare,6,22 December 2013,"Let's begin with some History, this was Stephen King's first novel, he thought it wasn't a good one so the toss it to a trash can, his wife picked it up and send it to an editor, the rest is History. This IS the novel that made Stephen King famous, and back in the 70's with Brian de Palma film Carrie a milestone for horror was made. Even if the new generations haven't seen the original movie, everybody knows who Carrie White is and the epic blood shower. Now, back to this year 2013, new Carrie White seems to be updated to a more evil story with social media involved. What is good about this movie? Chlöe Grace Moretz, we love her and she is a great Carrie, though, I think Sissy Spacek did it way much better. What is questionable about this movie? Julianne Moore, Come On!!! She is one of the best actresses of our times, in my personal point of view she was way bigger for this role but she made it great as always. What is bad about the movie? The ""upadte"" of 2013's problem. This might be just me, but I think the story works in the time it was written, now I don't think a story like this can be ""that"" realistic as it was. So, the final verdict; good so-so movie if you don't know who Carrie is and all the story behind.",Carrie
261,interestingstuff,I don't even know what the point of this movie was,6,14 October 2017,"This is almost exact copycat of the 1976 movie with the only difference being addition of cellphones. The director claims that she created a new version of the movie with a new interpretation instead of copying the 1976 version but this is not true at all. There was really no point in filming this movie at all. Apart from that, the movie was OK.",Carrie
262,bendy392,Good to know that I'm still not going to prom.,8,11 November 2013,"I read Rotten Tomatoes and when I saw the score, I thought ""ah, this is going to be one of those horror remakes that aren't nowhere near as good as the original, but it could've been worse"" because I'm a fan of the original...................I was wrong.The plot is-- oh, what? You've never heard of the legendary Carrie? Okay, okay. I'll be nice to you. Carrie is about a young timid high school girl outcast, who is constantly bullied at school and abused by her religious mother. After an incident in the school showers, Carrie discovers that she possesses telekinesis. Later, she is pranked on once again. Having enough, she snaps and uses her telekinesis to unleash hell on her tormentors.So, what's so good about this retelling of a classic that everyone remembers so well? Well, as every remake should be, it has different angles, different looks on the characters and just a different taste of the story. It is closer to the book, but that doesn't necessarily make it good. I will go as far to say that there are elements from this version I like better than the original 1976 version. For example, I think this Carrie, played by Chloë Grace Moretz, is more eloquent. She has more backbone while still being her timid character, like standing up to her mother, played by Julianne Moore, who portrayed the mother very well. We also see a closer connection to Carrie's acceptance from her classmates as time goes on in the film until the climax. Also the movie made a dark move right before Carrie snaps. Watch it and see what I mean. Like, I can't BELIEVE they did that but to be honest, I think that makes it even more dramatic and harshly tragic.This is no way of saying that the original sucked or anything. FAR from sucked. The remake surprisingly blew me away with its take on the tragic story. But of course, it is not without problems. I think the buildup to her telekinesis is WAAAAY too rushed. But the buildup to her breakdown at the prom is excellent. There are awkward moments though to be fair, the original had awkward moments too, so I guess it's a fair trade.I saw this movie twice and I would definitely get it on DVD the moment it is released on the open market. If the original didn't grab your attention, this one probably won't, but if you're a fan of the original, I'd say check this one out. The original is such a landmark in Hollywood, people may overlook this one and just simply say that the original is better. Decide for yourself, but as for me, I think it's a well told, solid remake of the original and not just a recycled formula.",Carrie

265,rich-66,Special Effect Cannot Compensate for Mediocre Acting,5,20 October 2013,"Brian de Palma's original 1976 film of Stephen King's horror masterpiece still reigns supreme. With little to amuse me this weekend, I took a chance on Kimberly Peirce's remake of the classic and reigning champion. With obvious updates for the past 37 years, the current film generally follows the novel. But character development is sorely lacking particularly for the ""mean"" senior girls (Sue Snell and Chris Hargensen played by Gabriella Wilde and Portia Doubleday respectively). What happened to the talented P. J. Soles' role of Norma; perhaps budgetary constraints? Julianne Moore comes across as an over enthused mother taking the place of Piper Laurie, undoubtedly the best acting of the cast. Alas poor Chloe Grace Moretz, although of the correct age for the part, needs more than a fearful stare to convince the viewer of her sincerity.",Carrie
266,Darrellbjones,"Not terrible, but you will probably find yourself bored and disappointed",4,19 October 2013,"First off, let me start out by saying this isn't a terrible movie. It certainly is not one of the worst horror movie remakes out there, but I can't help but feel disappointed from the 2013 version of Carrie. First off, this movie does not really add anything new to the mix. It's basically a copy of the original 1976 film, just with a modern setting. I generally am less critical of remakes than most, so the fact that I didn't like this should indicate that it just wasn't that good. I found myself bored throughout a lot of the movie. I've already seen the original, so why do I need to pay to see the exact movie again?The director really should have gone out of her way to differentiate this film from its predecessor, instead of making a near shot-for-shot remake like 1998's Psycho. One example of a remake that attempts to add something new to the mix is Rob Zombie's Halloween. While that film was pretty weak also, at least it tried to inject something new to the storyline. The only thing I can say that was better about the 2013 Carrie is that the gym teacher lived. I never understood why she died in the 1976 version since she was one of the few people that was nice to Carrie, so her survival made more sense in this movie. Other than that, the original far surpasses this version. If you haven't seen the original, you might like this film as you have nothing to compare it with. However, some that haven't seen the original still might find themselves bored. One last criticism with this version is the prom scene. You'd think with the special effects improvements between 1976 and 2013, this version's killer prom sequence would blow the original's out of the water. Not the case, as the original killer prom scene was much better in my opinionOverall, this wasn't a terrible film, but cannot even remotely compare to the original. Those that haven't seen the first film might very well enjoy it, but for those who have, you most likely will leave the theater disappointed. This remake was completely unnecessary, and adds absolutely nothing to the mix. If you've seen the original, then you've basically seen this as it's a hollow copy of it.Final Rating: 4/10",Carrie
267,Ivkaa,Not what I expected,5,29 October 2013,"I have seen the original Carrie long time ago and I loved it. When I heard the remake was coming out, I was very excited because I thought this movie will blow my mind considering how special effects evolved in the past decades. Unfortunately, for me this was not the case.I find the movie slow and all the action for me happened in the last 10 min. The movie was interesting but it was missing the tense atmosphere that a movie based on King would have. I find that the movie was ""overacted"" at parts and it was definitely ""missing"" something.The effects of the killings were definitely good....I was happy with this portion of the movie. They entertained me and were very descriptive.Overall, I would say that the original was much better even shot long time ago. I was a bit disappointed as the movie did not come even close to the original one let alone surpassing it.",Carrie
268,marianadulantob,A girl with telekinesis who is bullied by her classmates finally revenges,3,13 January 2014,"Once you have watched the original Carrie, with the incredible Sissy Spacek and overall a cast like the original, you can't just settle with something like the 2013 version. The new version exaggerates the suspense scenes in a way that it makes it really difficult to like them. In my opinion, who ever directed Chloë Grace Moretz should have avoided at all cost the ridiculous stare that we were forced to see 3 or 4 times during the movie. The original Carrie was unique, such a perfect mix of weird and beautiful that it made her somehow real and mysterious. To me, she was captivating without having to exaggerate her facial expressions, it was all in her eyes. And her interaction with her mother was just perfection. The blurriness and sort of dreamlike of the scenarios, the music, the exactitude of the scenes made the movie as well. Chloë Grace Moretz is a pretty girl next door, average somehow. I hope she realised once she saw the finished movie that an actress has to understand the character much more and put a limit to the directing, specially when you have play a special character. Julianne Moore was great, though. She was her usual great self, however, the original mom really exuded craziness, always with a little grin, empty eyes... I don't know how they did it, but the original was perfection. Just like trying to remake ""the girl with the dragon tattoo"", how can you cast someone like Noomi Rapace? There are actresses who can't be replayed by others. And Carrie is one of them.",Carrie
269,brian-2266,Decent Remake - Updated for Today's Audiences,8,21 October 2013,"I was concerned going into this movie that I would be disappointed compared to the original. I really was not. I see it for what it is, a very similar remake, updated to fit today's short-span audiences, but still a good entertaining Friday night movie.I am a huge fan of Chloe Grace Moretz, so I was excited to finally see this movie, and how she portrayed Carrie. She is an incredible young actress, and she rarely fails to entertain. Such is the case in Carrie. While I expected her performance to be excellent, I must say I was not so prepared to see Julianne Moore's portrayal of Margaret White to be quite so gripping. She quickly made us believe she was a very ill, child-abusing bible thumping nut-job.I am glad that the writers and directors chose to reduce 3 of the scenes from the original into shorter, more concise scenes. The scene where Carrie and her mother argue about the prom, the ""Sweet Prom Scene"" where her and Tommy nearly seem to fall in-love, and the amount of time Carrie spends on the stage just staring out at the laughing crowd and building up her anger in the original. ""THEY'RE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU!"" Every time I watch the original, I find myself wanting to fast-forward these scenes.I thought allowing the gym teacher to live was a good choice. It adds a little compassion to Carrie's character, even in her enraged state. Telling Sue she is pregnant and the sex of this child, however, made little sense to me.Otherwise, not a bad movie for a Friday night out with the lady. 8 of 10 for me, and another great Moretz movie to add to my collection when it comes out on BluRay.",Carrie
270,joshuaburles-646-993208,Elegant and inspiring,10,31 January 2014,"Carrie (2013) was truly amazing. Not only does it leave you with goosebumps, it leaves you with a sense or realization of what it would be like to be 'Carrie white'. This movie gives you a great example of bullying and how it effects not just teenage girls but boys as well. To me, Carrie had really well done FX and was astounding to the eye. But, if you don't like drama, horror or people with 'super powers' this is NOT your movie as it does contain some blood. But since i love all those genres this movie was captivating. This movie, in my full opinion was much better than the original, due to better actors and camera work. Carrie (2013) also went into a much greater detail of Carrie whites's life.",Carrie
271,samishoward,The Best Carrie Yet,8,27 October 2013,"This latest version of Carrie is definitely my favorite, having already seen the campy but fun '76 version, and the laughably bad '02 made for TV adaptation. Chloe Grace Moretz is perfect as the socially awkward, bullied, and abused Carrie White. She really lends sympathy to the role and her appealing performance makes you wince every time her peers humiliate her or her mother locks her in her mandated prayer closet. Julianne Moore is the crazy mother, and she has a good balance of religious fanaticism, misguided motherly love, and self-inflicted harm.The story is divided well between Carrie's preparations for her unexpected date to the prom, Sue Snell, a popular girl and her efforts to be kind to Carrie, and Chris Hargensen's plotting for a vicious prank. By the end of the movie, it's hard to say what element of the film is scariest: Carrie's burgeoning telekinesis, her mother's religion induced violence, or the malicious bullying that is decidedly pervasive. If I had to decide, I would say that the bullying in Carrie packs the biggest punch. It's painfully realistic in it's depiction of mean girl antics and cyber bullying. It's even one of the few movies with bullying as a central theme that explores the issue of teacher bullying, which is a reality that needs to be faced more often. Whether you're looking for a commentary on our modern-day culture of bullying, a good scary flick, or a very extreme tale of revenge, Carrie is the movie for you.",Carrie
272,Dolomede,Buffy goes to the prom.....,2,8 July 2014,"No, it doesn't work. Sissy Space managed to portray a genuine isolated outsider, she acted and looked like one. Chloe Grace works the other way, she looks like one of the regular girls trying to be an outsider. This makes her metamorphosis into a beautiful young woman for the prom scene have considerably less impact than Spacek's. You could see Tommy actually taking this girl to the prom. The prom scene itself is now X-Men meet Buffy - beautiful girls being hurled around telekinetically; multiple angle replays of cascading blood; selective slaughter. The Spacek version showed someone driven beyond self control by events, whose hidden powers were working at the level of the Id so all present suffered. This Carrie makes judgement calls in the middle of her carnage and although a nastier film graphically, this is an example of the PC hovering on the fringes of the film throughout. Finally, the last five seconds of the remake are a total anticlimax. They should have had the courage to revisit the image that made entire cinemas scream back in '76. It confirms what a disappointing effort this really is.",Carrie

See some complaints about it being so alike the 1976 original, but they are from the same story after all so that didn't bother me. I did like the way it's set in present time with bullying through internet and so on. Julianne Moore was brilliant as the Margaret White, Chloë Grace Moretz was ok And I liked that they took an actor who was actually the right age for playing Carrie. Even if Sissy Spacek did Carrie with bravura she was pushing 30 in 1976.No big surprises otherwise, feels like you know the story so. And Carrie didn't really need a remake but it's ok. My vote still goes to the 1976 original movie cant beat that. But 6/10",Carrie
275,indurain,"Watch out, Carrie can fly!",3,18 March 2014,"This is a cluster-duck of a movie. The first hour and fifteen minutes are a waste of time. To summarize: Carrie is an outcast and her mom is a looney; Carrie walks around school like Wodney Wat, scared to look at, much less talk to anyone; After she ""becomes a woman"", she discovers she has telekinesis and masters this power in oh, about 3 minutes or so.Once we hit the prom scene, it gets better, but not much. Carrie gets a shower of pig blood, turns into a pig-blooded killer and poor high school students are in the kill zone. Carrie takes on a wide eyed possessed look, much like the character Susan Cabot in ""Prince of Darkness"". Kids die and Carrie flies. Then Carrie goes after poor Mommy and that doesn't end well for either of them.Final shot is of Carrie's and Mommy's headstone, which starts to crack open. Will Carrie be back? Let's hope not.",Carrie
276,kentashcraft,Even great actors can be miscast,5,12 February 2014,"I'll admit up front that I would gladly watch Chloe Grace Moretz read the phone book. I consider her the greatest actress of her generation, with a range from here to Jupiter and a colossal screen presence. But that's why I have mixed feelings about her in this role. She's just too damn visually arresting to be believable as an outcast. You can't take your eyes off her, which is normally a good thing, but not for this part. Sissy Spacek (who was 10 years older!) had the kind of rabbity plainness that allowed her to fade into the background when needed. For better or worse, Chloe can't escape her superstar quality.Julianne Moore's performance is obviously more understated than Piper Laurie's was, which was wise on her part. Piper's performance in the role of the mother was flat-out iconic, and trying to reprise it would have been really risky. Otherwise, I did like the fidelity to the original in the script and dialog.Of course, as a sad sign of the times, the prom had a DJ rather than a live band like the original.",Carrie
277,vrspnpguyfun,Underwhelming in so many ways,2,30 October 2021,"I've seen all three versions of ""Carrie"". Of the three this is the bottom. Of course the original 1976 film is a classic the shines above the others with the top tier, academy award nominated performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Hard to surpass.Second, in my opinion is the 2002 film. Which is closest to the book. The acting isn't the best. It is a made for cable TV movie. And that annoying police investigation back and forth while original, and helped add some context to the film, kept pulling me out of the actual story. But it did show that Carrie wasn't fully in control of most of her rampage. That while subconsciously she wanted revenge she running on pure fury and moving on instinct.Then there's this movie. Good acting. Hell, good Kills. But feels SOOOOOOO subpar when you consider the source material and the two previous films. This one leaves a lot to be desired. It's like the director wasn't even really trying. It's original. When I excitedly went to see it in theaters I was so unimpressed that cheap for watching it. The director based this film off the 1976 film rather than the horror novel, which is excellent if you've never read it, and that should have been a major red flag. Especially since the original veered quite a bit from the book. It was Basically a remake of the first movie. And not a good one.Lastly, Carrie is telekinetic. Hey power comes from hey mind. Why and how is she using her hands? Like she's Pru Halloween Halliwell from ""charmed"". And then she stomped her foot and Cracked the street. So she's an earth bender now? And thing with Chris and the car, while cool made no sense. And why did she need to use her hands to fight off her mother. The power doesn't come from her hands.Oh! And apparently she can fly now.

279,phantomht1320,Laughably horrible,2,18 March 2019,"This was rated R, i have NO idea why.
Stay with me for a minute, the first Carrie, with the girls locker room scene there was slight nudity. Also later after the blood spill at the prom, Sissy had fantastic nips and very clingy gown. Now, before you go judging, this version was SO FAR in the other direction it was screaming at you the whole time ""we're trying to make a PG version of Carrie!""
I like Chloe a lot but this was a miscast. I can totally imagine Chloe putting it in her contract or whatever ""no cleavage, no panty lines, no nips, no nudity, nothing even REMOTELY sexy"". Again, i didnt want to see this particularly FOR any of those things but it was just screaming at you the entire time ""this is a Disney version of Carrie"". Another example, watch during the last fight scene with her mom, they fall to the ground with mom on top and chloe's night shirt or what ever it was rides up a little high on her leg, DURING FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE she reaches down to pull the shirt back down cuz a little bit too much of her leg was showing. THAT was ridiculous.
Should have cast an actress that isnt ashamed or scared to death of her body.The whole telekinesis thing was just dumb also. As fearful of her mom as she was she is going to risk getting caught with those books in her HOUSE? Also kinda dumb showing her 'powers' so early. The first Carrie didnt discover them til she was extremely angry and always kinda seemed to use them accidentally but Carrie v.2.0. says HEY, look what i can do, im like a Super Hero Bad Guy, Woo-Hoo!Carrie v.1.0. seemed to attack the gym teacher at the prom as sort of an accident where Carrie 2.0 attacked the gym teacher on purpose the first time which was dumb since the gym teacher was always lookin out for Carrie and she KNEW that.Carrie sonic blasting the prom. (rolls eyes).

280,caninecalmers,This movie was awesome,9,22 October 2013,"This is an awesome remake of the movie. I think Chloe has done an excellent job in her role, she looked awesome and scary for her wrath scene, loved it. and Julianne Moore made an amazing change for her mother role the only negative thing I will say is that it really lacked that Oomph I was hoping for (particularly from the teacher), but over all it was an awesome movie. I waited very impatiently to watch it :) and was SO excited when i finally could, and I was NOT disappointed :) There were a few new things in the movie which i liked. but a lot of it was the same as the original(even line for line on some occasions)which i also liked.it was an awesome modern version of an old movie that i will happily watch it again",Carrie
281,edroberts417,Carrie,6,10 November 2013,"The story is that when Gene Wilder first heard that a remake of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was in the works, his response was something along the lines of ""'why would you remake that movie?"" I can see Sissy Spacek asking the same question about the latest remake of ""Carrie."" And if she doesn't, I will. These two filmsare cultural touchstones part of our personal history, and people can be very protective of their personal history. The scene of Carrie's first period and the ""mean girls"" throwing tampons at her is a piece of cultural currency, so too, the prom scene in which she exacts her revenge. We remember the first time we saw them, maybe even who we were with or where it was, and now along comes a crew with the temerity to mess with our past. I don't want anyone telling me there is a Carrie better than my Carrie anymore than I want someone telling me that my Willy Wonka needs to be improved on. Jeez, why don't you just go rewrite Moby-Dick?Reinterpretation is one thing--Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now, The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven, Scarface and Scarface- -you get the idea, but a slavish copy of the original is quite another. The new ""Carrie"" is the same story with the same characters, but this time the kids have cooler cars and cell phones. They're stock characters, taken from the shelf with all the one-dimensional characters that populate most movies of this type. There is the ringleader of the mean girl posse, one Chris Hargenson, played well enough by Portia Doubleday. (It's hard to judge any of the supporting performances, given that the script does not offer much of an opportunity to show any complexity or nuance--that failure is on the writers and director, not the actors). Chris Hargenson is a ""mean girl"" and nothing more. There is no cleverness or subtle manipulation here, just meanness. In other words, she's no Regina George. (Speaking of another movie that probably shouldn't be remade.)There is the repentant ""mean girl"" with a good heart (Gabriella Wilde), who becomes Carrie's advocate and urges her nice-guy boyfriend to ask Carrie to the prom. Her transformation from the queen bee's lieutenant to sympathetic ally is unexplained. Why her? What is it about this particular girl that causes her to change rather than any of the other girls? We'll never know. We're never told enough about her.Julianne Moore, as Carrie's mother, is the only performer who gets anything to work with. She cares about her daughter and wants to save her from pain, particularly the kind that comes from the ""original sin"" that men and women get up to, but she does so in that Christian nutcase way, with rabid reciting of scripture and locking Carrie in a closet to pray and repent for being a woman. She refers to Carrie's breasts as ""devil's pillows,"" for Christ's sake. But Margaret White's craziness is somewhat understandable. She calls Carrie's conception a ""taking."" Whether that means a forced taking or one that was thrust upon her in a marriage isn't clear. Whichever it was, by the time of Carrie's birth, Margaret is on her own, giving birth alone in her bedroom and, while in the throes of labor, calling Carrie a ""cancer"". The scene is shot from above, with nothing in the frame but Margaret lying on her back, covered with a white sheet, alone in a blank universe, nothing to cling to, no hand to hold except an imaginary one. The script gives short shrift to the main character, as well. Lawrence D. Cohen, credited with the original adaptation from a Stephen King novel, co-wrote with Roberto Aquirre and apparently they didn't think that a new script needs new character development, instead relying on work that was done in the original. Trust me, we'll be seeing a lot more of Chloe Grace Morets in the coming years, but in ""Carrie"" she has to deal with the same thin character development. Carrie comes off as exceedingly shy, but without the fragility of the original. Crossed arms and hunched shoulders don't quite convey the kind psychological pain that spawns telekinetic powers. Morets is a little too beautiful and too self-assured when dealing with her bible thumping mother (Literally- -she whacks Carrie in the head with one, ostensibly trying to knock a little Jesus into her.) Spacek's Carrie was about to snap from start to finish--she felt brittle as glass. Morets comes off merely as about to fold and whither. The vengeful mayhem she wreaks in the prom scene is too calculated, too intentional. It's brutal revenge, no doubt about that, but with her smoothly choreographed arm movement, the intention and control of her actions, it lacks the sense of unleashed, unconscious rage of the original. After the stellar ""Boys Don't Cry,"" it's disheartening to see Kimberly Pierce wasting her obvious talent here. It's been almost fifteen years since that release and she hasn't done much since, so maybe this is what she needed to do to get back into the game. Here, she is working within a form and on a production intended for the mass market. It had to be slick, but it's too slick, with none of the edgy camera or talent direction of her signature effort, which achieved a startling intimacy with its characters. Was she phoning it in? I hope not--she doesn't have a deep enough portfolio to get away with that. This is safe filmmaking. DePalma was young and courageous when he directed the original, unhindered by expectations and willing to take risks. He was simply making a horror film, while Pierce had to go up against an icon, and it feels like she was intimidated and afraid to put her own stamp on it.",Carrie

283,charlyparly,Sadly fell short and didn't even seem sure of itself.,5,13 November 2019,"To be fair it was always going to be a tall order and very hard to live up to the original but it felt like everyone involved was unsure of what to do, how to play it and where to go with this one. It lacked any real depth or commitment which is a shame given that it was well cast.For the most part the film remained true to the original but was set in a more modern time and age making social media a bully's tool of the trade and Carrie's humiliation spread far and wide way beyond the school gates.Moretz played the role as well as she could but think even she was unsure of her way around Carrie White. She didn't convince not least because she's too pretty and has a shy, awkward attractiveness about her that doesn't ring true as a victim and complete social outcast.I didn't care at all for the excessive facial grimacing and mouthing as though roaring during her efforts to move and control objects. The arm movements were too much and too often then when she floated off the stage during prom, I was out. Until then I was willing to forgiving the exaggerated head and facial movements but the flying - no. It really did give an immediate feel of naff.Moore was a very watered down version of the original Mother and played the role much quieter, calmer and more as a mentally unstable woman than God fearing lunatic. Again it's a tough call to beat or come close to the original.Elgort didn't have much impact or justify the role of Tommy Ross. Although kind, courteous and a gentleman to Carrie, you didn't get a sense it was a genuine fondness or affection. It felt all the time like straight after the prom he would have no interest whatsoever in even glancing Carrie's way ever again.The script changes included having Sue spared by Carrie after she goes to her home following the prom and finds her cradling her dead Mother. She pleads with Carrie not to hurt her, to take her hand and let her help.If this change was to include Sue reaching out literally to help Carrie, it makes no sense that she would have gone through the entire film quietly arranging to loan her boyfriend Tommy so that Carrie could go to prom rather than have her try to reach out and befriend her in person before.I'm not sure how or in what way it could have been done to include a more modern angle without straying too much from the original but it felt as though it tried but wasn't seen through all the way.Shame as well cos with a little more time and some careful though, it could have been done well.",Carrie

It is the exact same story, and it even repeats the exact same lines as in the original, but the story is not nearly as nicely portrayed as in the original one.I am especially not happy with Carrie's mom's role in this remake. In the original 1976 film, Carrie's mom seemed to be this nice (yet religious) woman that most people can relate to. However, in this remake, Carrie's mom just seems like a complete religious nutshell that does not have any human touch to her.

286,vchung-05758,A glossy and well-acted but ultimately unnecessary remake,6,21 January 2021,"This is a review of Carrie (2013), the 2013 remake adaptation of Stephen King's classic horror novel. It stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Carrie White, a troubled teenager who discovers that she has telekinetic powers, while having to contend with an abusive mother and school bullies. The film also stars Julianne Moore as Margaret White, Carrie's abusive mother and a religious fanatic; and Judy Greer played Miss Desjardin, Carrie's supportive gym teacher. Directed by Kimberly Peirce, the film is competently shot and the acting is good, but it just seems superfluous at times and comes off as a retread of well-worn territory.Regarding the acting, Chloe Grace Moretz was a perfectly fine Carrie White, showing an apt level of vulnerability needed for the character and keeping that sense all throughout the film, even as she gains some more agency and confidence through her development of her powers. However, I have noticed (as have many others) that Moretz seemed a little too picture-perfect, a little too glamorously-portrayed to be regarded as a target ripe for bullying. It must be said that in real life, perfectly normal-looking people can and do get bullied, but in film, audience members usually expect some level of at least seeming unattractiveness from victims of bullying, while Moretz just seemed too attractive to be believable as someone being ostracized and bullied, even with her freak-out over her first period taken into consideration.Other than that, her performance was very good. Julianne Moore was a great deranged Margaret White, clearly having a fun time playing a disturbed religious fanatic. The actors and actresses who played the bullies weren't given much to do other than look attractive, act evil and condescending, and occasionally have doubts before doubling down on their vicious acts. The only exception is Sue, played by Gabriella Wilde, who regrets her part in the initial bullying and quickly tries to do her best to make amends to Carrie. She is shown as sympathetic yet helpless and rather ineffectual. Overall, the acting in the film was pretty good.Regarding the plot, which hewed closely to the original novel, it concerns Carrie discovering her telekinetic powers amidst a tragic coming-of-age story, being bullied by popular girls at school and suffering at the hands of an abusive and overbearing single mother who has obsessively religious beliefs. However, because of this, it doesn't really do anything new and aside from a setting update into the late 2000s/the early 2010s, there isn't much of anything original here, nothing the novel and its older adaptations haven't already covered.Overall, the film was competently made, being well-shot and with good editing, good acting, but had some bad special effects and a tired plot that comes off as a complete retread without adding much to the story.Score: 6/10",Carrie
287,sheance114,"Bloody, interesting yet lacking.",7,24 March 2014,"MAJOR SPOILERS""Bloody, interesting yet lacking.""Carrie is an American supernatural horror film about a girl who discovers she has telekinesis; a power of the mind to control things, and her struggle through high school where she experienced a modern kind of bullying especially about her first bloody period. Carrie does not only struggle at school but also directly at home with her mother who's got some 'mental illness' due to being too much enticed religiously, pathetically thinking that wearing a sleeveless is a mortal sin. The film was released on October 18, 2013, after postponing the March 15, 2013 release.Carrie stars Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) as the notoriously famous Carrie White and the Oscar Nominee and Emmy Award best actress Julianne Moore (Game Change) as Margaret White, Carrie's mother.Carrie is classic redux of the 1976 film and an adaptation of Stephen King's classic in the same name.Yet, the popularity of the first adaptation (1976) in other countries did not reach to where I live, therefore, I haven't seen, heard of read anything about Carrie. It's a relatively good perspective so that no comparison will be made out from this review, which I appreciate in doing, and I appreciate in reading. Not to disrespect Stephen King or the creators of the first adaptation; but it would be fair for me to review a film as it is.I noticed how deep the storyline of the story was. From Margaret White's ignorance of pregnancy, which she thought was cancer; to Carrie's dreadful first period which she thought was some kind of disease. It also imparts the new age of bullying in the United States that includes technological ways (Cyber Bullying), which demonstrates the range of the modern matter that causes new wave adversary in youngsters.The build-up of the story was somehow a bore, but thankful for the length of the movie that was only an hour and a half which defer viewers from total boredom.Then the intensity came where (as everyone expected) the prom began, and Carrie, herself, started to rebel from her mother's irrational, impractical and nonsensical guard. The part where the pig's blood splattered on Carrie's head that had been repeated three times in the movie was interesting and useful that gives the awe moment. Then from there, the climax of the redux extricates from the deepening build-up.The climax did appease me, somehow, and how Chloe Moretz portrayed a possessed-like girl that murdered numerous of people in one setting and that she lost to her senses due to the circumstances. The plenty of action engrossed me in my seat, making me bend forward to wait for that climatic 'umpf' moment. There were loads of bloody sparklers and I enjoyed every bit of vengeance Carrie made from her intimidators.How grueling the mass murder happened in the movie, gives excitement. Up to the portion where she gets the revenge to the biggest bully of all in the film. But, oh, it was just a normal way to die and it was one of the part where I find lack; I wished there was more of a triumphant feel having the ultimate vengeance from you enemy. (I waited for a part where Carrie tells her enemy, ""BITCH!"" before she died.)But no, it was just a simple death. I preferred a death in front of number of people or something else. And they have the choice to redirect the movie away from the past recreation/adaptation of the book. (Yet still Carrie fan boys and girls will be frustrated with my idea for sure).And another lack I felt was the lack of depth from Carrie's bullying story. Carrie being thrown tampons and napkins was too much, but that was just the start of it all. The online video leak (Cyber Bullying) did not even take part of a strong portrayal of modern bullying which causes even suicides to some (sorry). But it was just a useless instrument that did not give a strong voice which should be the most important fact of all, since, let's face it, Cyber Bullying nowadays is the trend on how to crush someone's dignity and entire persona. That should've been emphasized.The acting was not believable either which roots the blame to the directing. Except for Julianne Moor who gave a chilling performance, applauded her in the movie.The movie ended with me still hanging on my seat still waiting for that climatic 'umpf' moment. But it did not come.The entire movie was interesting, (from a perspective of non-comparison review) yet not satisfying and gives you a feel of 'okay, that was it'. I am much disappointed with how the movie went since it stars one of my new favorite actresses, Chloe Moretz. And also the fact of the in-time issue which is Bullying and how awful it is and lastly, I fancy revenge stories. All of those enticed me to watch the movie. But it failed me somehow.I wonder how fans of the original movie react to the remake.",Carrie

It just wasn't that good.So, they have a young extremely talented hot actress in Chloe Grace Moretz, what can be done to show off her immense talent? A remake of Carrie! Only this time it's going to be BIGGER, because technology is much more advanced. Maybe make the movie closer to the King novel. Whatever was going to be done, it was going to have Moretz and how can you go wrong with remaking a classic? I didn't think I was going to like this. I went in with low expectations, as I do with most remakes.I just didn't realize I was going to hate it as much as I did. If you want to know what's wrong with film making today watch this. Play this version scene by scene next to the DePalma version and you will clearly see the difference in a great film maker and an absolute hack. You can practically run them scene by scene, because the only difference between this and the original is cell phones and youtube. I swear even the dialogue seemed exactly the same, just not delivered as well. What an absolutely pathetic piece of trash this was.I just hope this doesn't ruin Moretz's career. This was a awful terrible career move. Whoever told her this was a good idea should be fired.",Carrie
290,erwin_nys,Not very good,4,27 September 2020,"Not very good.It starts with the opening scene where Carrie is born and the umbilical cord just magically disappears when her mother (after not killing her) lifts her up to hold her against her chest.
After that a lot of headscratching scenes occur.I've just read the book two weeks ago so it is still fresh in my memory, the movie is way different. Its mostly inspired by the book but that's it. Which is okay, I guess. But Margaret telling Carrie she loves her a couple of times during the movie was so out of character that it didn't even make sense.The lack of background story ruined Billy for me too.All in all, it's an okay watch on its own. Just dont read the book beforehand.",Carrie
291,billbeast,Better than expected.,7,1 December 2013,"I must admit that after watching the trailer for the movie, I was very disappointed. The movie didn't look good, but as Australia gets very little horror in cinemas I go and see every release from the genre.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Traditionally, nothing much happens until right at the very end but Kimberly Peirce manages to keep you entertained and enthralled in the story and gets you ready for the explosive climax.The climax is definitely the best part of the movie, and it's much more violent than I expected and I loved it. Death scenes were great, and I feel that Carrie really redeems herself in the last scene.The acting was great. Julianne Moore is terrific as the overly religious Margaret White and plays her with a terrifying amount of believability. Chloe Moretz was good as Carrie, but I really do feel like she is too pretty for the role. If they had made her look more average before the prom it would've been nice. Judy Greer was great as sympathetic P.E teacher that seems to be Carrie's only friend and I would've liked to have seen that relationship explored a little more.Im not a huge fan of the original film, and I think this remake is one of the better ones from the last few years. It doesn't overload with violence like many others and it's got just the right amount of gloss that I think older audience will be able to enjoy it too.",Carrie
292,jusdiz2,Actors tried hard but the film just don't work,5,12 January 2014,"I have a mixed up feelings about this movie. On the one side I found it emotional and scary, on the other side - it is disappointing. There are strong sides: Julliane Moore's acting, the basic idea (for which we must be thankful to Stephen King) and hard-to-fail final. BUT the main beautiful actress is too beautiful and too alive for this role of introverted traumatized girl. I didn't like the starting and ending of the film because I found it artificial and commercial. So I will not watch this movie for a second time, but I don't regret watching it, still it let me to think about how we can and should help children who suffer from their parents and classmates aggression. All in all, I didn't like this movie, although I like it's actors, they still are worth a good word for their efforts!",Carrie
293,erik_adams123,How to do a remake.,9,5 February 2020,I'll never truly understand the hate that this movie gets. It's well acted and the writing is not bad at all. The prom scene is definitely the best shot of all the Carrie movies made.,Carrie
294,tb7682,Decent attempt,7,28 October 2013,"My husband, mother, and I decided to see Carrie this weekend to put us in the Halloween spirit. Carrie is a remake from the original late 1970's movie. I can't say that I remember much of the original Carrie so I won't have much to compare it with. However, this movie is pretty good. It follows the same story line as the original movie just adapted to our lifestyle today. The special effects are obviously way better than the original with the more advanced technology we have today. The actors were great as well. There were many of them that I have not heard of before but they played their characters well. The most impressive was Chloe Grace Moretz. She looked and acted exactly like an awkward teenage girl that had no clue how to fit in. My mother said that it was good but wasn't as good as the original. I believe this will be a common complaint for those that were alive when the original came out. Overall, it was a decent attempt at a classic.",Carrie
295,fachrial-ilham,Weak,4,12 November 2013,"I love Chloe Moretz and have been anticipating her movies. I expect a lot from this one as well but I came out a little bit disappointed. Carrie is not Chloe's best performance although I can see that she gave her all out in this movie. Note that I did not watch the previous movies and did not read the book, but judging from this movie alone, Carrie is lacking in a lot of ways. The camera works are just somewhere between the average zone while the acting is simply ordinary. Julianne Moore who plays the mother performed well but not exceptional. The rest of the casts are just the same. I can't feel any emotions coming out of the movie. This is a movie you soon forget. And even though I love Chloe, I cannot give this movie more than just 4 stars.",Carrie
296,msjlpalo,A good movie to start with,7,4 November 2013,"If you are thinking that this is a scary movie, it's not. Instead, it is a movie that advocates against bullying and that it may change your views about Christian people (but its not what this movie portrays, I am a Christian)So, Carrie is originally a novel by Stephen King who writes mostly horror stories, and I've read this novel and it is different to what the book is. Which I think is a good thing, it's quite amazing how they changed the setting to present day so that viewers (mostly teenagers) may relate to it.The prom scene is magical! and how Tommy Ross is, I just love how Tommy Ross in this movie is not as like the 1976 version which kissed Carrie and like completely forgotten his girlfriend Sue. And kudos to Moretz! because she make a wonderful victim of bully, a prom queen, as well as a killer. She just have that look! (This is a compliment, really!) It's cool how she can portray those in one film and that you can really feel the hurt and the pain she feels through her eyes and expressions.This movie might have disappoint me for I have been looking for a good horror film to really scare the hell out of me, but turns out this is a good film! and a good book as well. I recommend it to everyone! :D",Carrie
297,onsetbeachbum,It Failed,4,12 February 2014,"It was OK, Carrie in this version was a bit to pretty for the part. Some of the acting was not up to par. I've seen every version of this movie and this one was probably second to worst though the special effects were up to date. Julianne Moore was great and convincing, as for everyone else in the movie.....not so much. I think it's time to put this movie on the shelf. I am very surprised that Stephen King approved of this version (shame on him). The original is by far the best. The other problem I had with this version is that Carrie used her hands to make things move as opposed to her mind like the original, therefore, it looked more like witchcraft. Not sure why they put an ""R"" rating on this version, it wasn't needed.",Carrie
298,goatboy-43868,Not a patch on the original.,3,28 December 2019,"If you came to this not knowing the 70's Brian de Palma film you might enjoy it a a reasonable teenage horror flick. I started watching it and then stopped half way through and watched the original again, then watched the rest of it. True the script stays fairly close to the original film, but what I hated was how the character Carrie was portrayed. In the original she was the shy naive and innocent victim, which Sissy Spacec played perfectly, and her mom was the real monster. In this version, Carrie just comes across as a vindictive witch who just wanted revenge on all those who crossed her. which kind of reverses the whole meaning of the film. It's not a bad film, but totally subverts the meaning of the original. Some films should not be remade. I say this not as a film snob, but some films are perfect as they are and any attempt to remake them is never going to work. Watch it if you haven't seen the original, but if you remember the source material for this, you are bound to be disappointed.",Carrie
299,Mrsbooga,Ok but slow in parts,4,15 August 2020,This is a mild horror film. Quite slow in parts. Over rated and predictable,Carrie
300,ThomEure,Remake Rather Than Reimaging...But Still GOOD!,8,20 October 2013,"I have been eagerly awaiting this movie since I heard of the casting of Chloe Grace Moretz. I could totally picture her portraying the character in the style and feel created by Sissy Spacek and followed up by Angela Bettis (2002 TV movie). I knew she would be a worthy successor after seeing the film Let Me In. I was, however, skeptical of the casting of Julianne Moore as the religious fanatic mother of Carrie, Margaret White.After seeing the film twice this weekend, Julianne Moore turned out a creepy performance that should definitely garner her an Academy Award nod. Her portrayal of Margaret White was an emotional witches brew of fanaticism, insanity, and maternal instinct. For me, it was an unexpected treat.As for Carrie, Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job. She had big shoes to fill, and her performance does not top that of Sissy Spacek. However, she does hold her own. In all three versions of Carrie, each actress has portrayed Carrie in a different way. Each excelling in making the role their own while maintaining the artistic concept of Carrie herself. Chloe did deliver a chilling performance during the scenes where Carrie is exacting her revenge.As for the movie itself, I would describe it as a remake of the 1976 film sprinkled with some additional elements from the Stephen King novel. It was very well made, and the modernization is appropriate without being too obvious of the change in times, i.e cell phones, the Internet, etc.In closing, Carrie is an extremely competent attempt at remaking a classic. As I say with all remakes, you have to go into it with an open mind and not with the mind set of comparing it to the original. If you do that, you will find Carrie is a good movie.",Carrie

You really start to feel for Carrie (Chloe Grace Moretz) it gets you worked up, angry and in some scenes upset.the acting from Chloe is amazing and very believable not to forget the brilliant job by Julianne Moore, she plays a nutty, bible loving, weirdo well... bravo!!so give it a go and i'm sure you wont be disappointed, and when its all over you wont regret the 1 hour and 40 minutes you toke to watch this great movie.",Carrie
303,dmacmelville-270-465862,Lacking heart,4,29 March 2014,"Wow. WTF. It's so obvious that the original film was a huge influence on the remake, but what happened? It is so off! Julianne Moore is wonderful as a mentally ill, but loving, violent mother. You can tell she loves Carries but she's a freakin' mess. But otherwise, all the heart is missing from this film. First all the high school students come off like rejects from a Real Housewives franchise. These are not kids who drink beer in parking lots, they're kids who drink martinis by somebody's pool while they plot against the odd duck. And Carrie! She seems not like lost teen who has some odd powers that are there in a pinch but more like an evil sorceress who has hit the end of her rope. They were so good at referencing the original in nice ways, even the spinning dance scene at the prom, but it just all went wrong. The first felt like a dreamy fairy tale with a monster and a princess and a mean world. This feels like a revenge fantasy against the Mean Girls. It just did not work for me. Maybe if they all were still a bit more naive and not so cookie-cutter midget super models. Too bad.",Carrie
304,dhstorch123,It's a dud. Wait for DVD,3,18 October 2013,"Remakes seldom come close to matching the original, we watch them in hopes that it will at least bring something new to the story. Not only does the 2013 version fail to do this in comparison to the 1976 original, it fails even in contrast to the previous 2002 remake. The film is overworked with special effects and the script doesn't even deviate much from the original, which left me wondering what the point of this newest reincarnation was. A side from a brilliant performance from Julianne Moore (in a disheveled form that leaves the beautiful actress almost unrecognizable), the acting really falls flat. I thought C.G. Moretz looked more like she was having an orgasm every time she used her telekinetic abilities. The bizarre special effects during the infamous prom scene also reminded me of a twisted version of Disney's Fantasia. On a positive note for parents with teens or preteens interested in the film, the course language and nudity is kept to minimum. Even the shower scene left all of natures gifts tastefully covered. Although there is some violent content in the final scenes, it isn't over done. The movie is still a complete flop, and unfortunately leaves the door open for what is sure to be an even worse sequel. Wait for DVD.",Carrie
305,Firestorm-86,A faithful entertaining remake,7,20 December 2013,"You can only push someone so far before they break. Carrie White was a regular girl in almost every way, she had hopes and dreams, but all she wanted was to fit in ""Carrie"" directed by Kimberley Pierce (Boys Don't Cry) is a faithful remake to the 1976 Brian de Palma film providing a much needed, rejuvenated look to a classic story of revenge.Chloe Grace Moretz, mostly known for supporting roles in ""500 Days Of Summer"" and ""Kick-Ass"" comfortably plays the title character, she does well to portray the innocence and vulnerability early on and transitions the character to the blood dripping teenager who unleashes a telekinetic terror on her small town during senior prom. Moretz continues to grow as a young actress but it's Julianne Moore's' performance of Carries mother that is most impressive.Having played an unnerving mother earlier in the year in the superb ""What Maisie Knew"", Julianne Moore injects the perfect amount of creepiness into her performance of Margaret White, The opening scene shows Margaret suffering an agonising labour, crediting the pregnancy as a test from God and claiming her newborn as a cancer Margaret allows her devout religious beliefs to compromise how she will raise her child. It is clear to us that this poor girl is going to have a very difficult upbringing.Director Pierce does well to retain the famous scenes from the original, they are well presented with some cleverly placed nods to modern technology, such as Carries embarrassing shower moment recorded and broadcast via IPhones and YouTube by school bully Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday).The movie flows at a decent pace and our feeling of empathy towards Carrie morphs to one of excitement when she discovers her telekinetic, And when Carrie is suspiciously asked to the prom we are delighted for her, even though we all know what's going to happen.The ""Carrie prom"" scene is iconic in cinema history. It has been replicated and parodied on many occasions so it needed to, and was approached with a certain amount of care and responsibility, although there were a number of small editing annoyances.Moretz style like her character does a U-turn at the climax of the film, she consciously changes to puppet-like movement to exhibit the controlling presence from deep within her. The addition of computer visual effects provides these scenes with some great visual gruesomeness, a protruding car accident the most memorable..With a solid performance from the supporting cast, Carrie is an adequate and faithful remake, whilst not the greatest film of the year, it's a story of that will keep you wondering who the real villain is...",Carrie
306,FavACgM,terrible but still watchable,4,6 January 2014,"hey there, I felt disappointed, though the cast of the movie was good chosen, I mean Julianne Moore will never be a incorrect decision in roles like this one and Chloe Moretz already features in some dark movies and she knows how to act those, I didn't really felt the emotions of Tommy Ross that he really liked Carrie, but well it was Ansel Elgort was first role. In addition the loneliness of Carrie White wasn't good conveyed by Chloe Moretz, anyhow the enthusiasm for her magical abilities. So many important things of the story were messed up buy the performance. Furthermore the special effects were well done, I got good entertained.",Carrie
307,dena_nobi-suke,Almost useless and it is not scary at all,5,29 June 2014,"I thought this movie could be something worth to watch. Because I always love Moretz. But then, after I finished watching the movies. The only word I said after movie is ""What the hell?!"" This is a disappointment. Almost useless and it is not scary at all. I even hate this movie. Why Moretz play this role? Such a pity. The relationship between Carrie and her mother is boring. They fight, they love, they fight again and again. Carrie's power doesn't look scary, even when the torturing scene starts it doesn't look scary after all. The dialogs are pointless, it just like a chick movies. The high school girls bullying and things like that, it doesn't deserve 6, at least 5. Is Hollywood run out of ideas for Horrors? come on stop remaking what's already been good.",Carrie

It is more like a Lifetime movie special. -If you are in love with the old Carrie, and especially Sissy Spacek, for the love of God do NOT see this movie (Sissy Spacek fans were horrified with the new Carrie)Okay, having said that....the ""half pretty good"" part:-once I let go of comparing this new Carrie with the old movie, I tried to just have fun with it, and so SECOND PART of movie was not too bad, and dare I say *pretty good* (again, I am not comparing this with the brilliant 1970s horror movies) -I accepted that it was just a fun movie and then it started to become more entertaining as the acting got better (this new actress did revenge scene pretty effortless, and it even seemed very fun and cathartic to see her demolish all the mean girls!) -there were some changes towards the end, but I actually liked them (certain people were acknowledged as ""good guys"" which I don't recall happening in original) -towards end, we screamed and yelled a lot and it was fun, so we left movie feeling happyIn short, if you want a good, quality flick, DON'T SEE this.If you want to see a FUN ""horror""/thriller movie and you're not picky about writing & acting, then this is good.

309,zemoguy,Underrated Movie,9,18 January 2014,"Director Kimberley Peirce has done, in my opinion, a very admirable job at directing this remake of the 1976 classic Brian De Palma film. It was a cult movie back in the day and although there are many similarities between this and the original movie this new version definitely has the edge thanks to great casting. Chloe Grace Moretz fares better than Sissy Spacek has the deluded naïve and innocent Carrie White and looks closer in age to Kings vision from the original novel. As the film progresses the better the characters become. Juliane Moore was cast perfectly in the role of Margaret White who picked up where Piper Laurie's role left off not only does she torture Carrie but in this version she tortures herself and the bond between the two differs from the original film and the book and was down in part to the artistic licence of it's director. It was this mother and daughter bond that worked for me and gave this film the edge over the original version.",Carrie
310,Quillmaster,Better prom scene in the original,6,26 April 2014,"I've always been a fan of the original, despite it being a bit slow and certainly not a masterpiece, so I was looking forward to it being brought up to date in this remake.Unfortunately, at best this is only on par with the original. Some of the effects are marginally better, but the character development between Carrie and her mother were far superior in the 1976 version. If I'd rented this I might have thought I'd got my monies worth, but having bought it, I'm mildly disappointed.What made the 1976 version truly shine was the way it dealt with the prom scene, splitting the screen to give multiple views while the music changed to indicate a change in the potency of her powers. The split screen was revolutionary at the time, and the remake really missed a trick in not paying homage to the original by duplicating this style , which is somewhat strange considering it did pay homage in other less noticeable minor ways.The original might be dated, but the build up and culmination of Carries' powers is far more convincing, along with the brilliant portrayal of her mother.",Carrie
311,tiinamalm,Not worth your money or time,3,2 November 2013,"Unfortunately, as good as the story (by S King) is, this movie is hardly to any good. The earlier from 1970ies is worth watching, though. Julianne Moore is (as earlier mentioned by others) great as the psychotic mother of Carrie. However, and sadly, Carrie herself has only two or three expressions: ""timid"", ""frightful"" and "" dangerous"" (you might call it ""making the face"" as well). The music does not follow the story or is unacceptably poor. The last (and one of the best parts in an otherwise worthless film) is sadly in the beautiful end. You might (if you wish) see the story or hints to nowadays serious troubles at schools ( like school attacks), and that makes the last scene deeper.",Carrie

I also realized, that the film has had many deleted scenes, even scenes not released with approximately 45 minutes of cut, I would like a director's extended cut even though the film has passed 7 years.",Carrie

There isn't really a solid build up of suspense. Trying to have Chris struggle to get the pigs blood bucket to pour out, and showing Chloe-Carrie getting hit with it 3 times...nice try but...it keeps getting lamer.

314,bill_the_butcher7,'Carrie' Remake Offers Up Nothing New,5,29 October 2013,"Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) is not your average high school girl. A shy social outcast that is constantly bullied by her classmates and sheltered by her very religious mother (Julianne Moore), Carrie eventually learns that she has a gift others don't: telekinesis. After being humiliated at her senior prom, she uses her power to get violent revenge on the people who made her life miserable for too long.'What happened to Carrie?' is one of the taglines for this movie, but in the case of the film's quality, it is a truly applicable question. What happened? Featuring a cast of great actors, an ""updated"" re-imagining of the Stephen King story, and technology for better effects than when Director Brian De Palma's version was made in 1976, this should've been the Carrie we all have been waiting for. Instead, we are left with a stale remake that doesn't bother adding anything new to a classic horror tale.One of the biggest flaws of Carrie is the way in which none of the actions of the characters feel genuine. Other than the way Carrie walks hunched and has messy hair, there is nothing that feels strange about her. When she walks through the halls and sees spray painted obscenities about her on the lockers, you can't help but feel confused as why she is bullied. High school is no doubt an awkward time, but Carrie never comes across as truly tortured.Even when nice guy Tommy Ross (Ansel Elgort) takes Carrie to the prom as ordered by his guilty-feeling girlfriend Sue Snell (Gabriella Wilde), you almost completely forget Carrie has even been picked on. Classmates talk to her, Tommy dances with her, and Carrie exuberates a type of confidence so quickly it feels out of character. Also, Carrie's cries to her mother don't come across as someone truly tormented by their guardian, but instead as a 'mom, you're embarrassing me' plea. There feels no sense of dread, even when Moore is at her terrifying best. It feels like Carrie is just going through the motions of the original; it understands where the story needs to go and does it without pumping any real meaning into it.Another vital mistake is the heavy use of CGI. While scenes where Carrie uses her telekinesis to float objects works with CGI, many of the 'horror' scenes use it with awful results. The effects are so obvious that it pulls you out of any moment where they are applied and, like in the case of the prom scene, creates a hokey, laughable mess. The very last shot of the film is so ludicrous that it makes you really appreciate the practical effects of the original.Carrie does feature some good performances from Moore and Elgort, but it is ultimately Mortez who feels miscast. Watching Carrie was like experiencing extreme déjà vu for most scenes, and while it isn't terrible, it fails to offer any reason to view it other than to see different faces.",Carrie
315,jakelawvideo,An amazing story with WAY to much Gore,4,18 October 2013,"This story is very interesting and quite true as it follows the life of a young girl in High School. And things basically go crazy for her when her peers judge her and act poorly. The moral of the story is absolutely brilliant and I will apply it to my life very thoroughly. While I loved the story and the Moral, I felt it was portrayed with way too much blood, violence, and terror. Some scenes, I didn't even want to watch, and almost walked out of the theatre because Of how vulgar, disgusting and completely over the top all of the injuries, death, and crazy things that were happening. But then after walking out practically hating the movie, I realized that There almost was no other way for this story to play out. It had to be like this, in order for the story to be completely....real. But, As real as it could be. The ending kind of.....Sucked. They end it like it was a horror movie. And it clearly isn't. So, I now know it IS rated R for very serious reasons, I do not recommend anyone under the age of 16 to see it at all. There are some very short sexual scenes as well. Overall, It was an experience I wont forget for quite some time, but weather that is a good thing or not, I'll just have to live with it.4 Out of 10 - 1 star for the story, 1 star for the Moral, 1 star for the Fantastic Acting and one more star for the Realism.",Carrie
316,dolphy_hawkins,Carrie: a name for the imaginations of the next generations,4,6 January 2014,"A great opportunity to update a classic tale and introduce it to another generation. A story of bullying and the hopelessness of having a face which doesn't fit coupled with a demeanour rendered awkward by paternal eccentricity and fanaticism. It is a tale that, when tended to with care and patience, brought pertinent to the peculiarities of modern teenage life could build to a crescendo of revenge and psychotic empathy. Unfortunately the choice of the actress for Carries's face did in fact fit... except to a role where it was not supposed to. Pretty and awkward, due to her inherent lack of awkwardness, our anti-heroine lumbered and pouted through her devastating experiences with as much plausibility as a fox with a rubber glove on its head trying to catch chickens. Distracted by this virtuoso piece of miscasting, the tension creaked and groaned its way to the finale but sadly all the surprises had already been carelessly revealed. I was left only with the hope that everyone would come to a sticky end and never act again .. Sadly, due to what appears to have been an audition for the next Twilight prequel, I fear I will have to witness much of this spitefully saccharine ensemble again.",Carrie
317,harmonyrose10,Amazing remake.,7,9 November 2013,"A re imagining telling of the story Carrie based on the novel by Stephen King. In my opinion Carrie's Chloe Grace Moretz is mesmerizing. Carrie 2013 is amazing for it's acting and it is also great for keeping some of the scenes from the original that are not shown in the book. I found that this version of Carrie focused more on the mother and daughter relationship story. Carrie loves her mother and her mother loves her. (Also said by Kimberly Pierce.)I agree with her. It also shows that Margaret is trying to be the best parent that she does not know how to be. (Also said by Chloe Grace Moretz.) I also agree with her. Both movies have different qualities. The original you see has more of a creepy and insane feel to it. In this adaptation of the story, you see Carrie as a bit more innocent and that she is not hurting innocent people. Even though she does in the book. But I guess it depends what you like. I would recommend you watch it if you loved the original.",Carrie
318,mafster-34-787950,Did it need to be remade?,5,30 June 2014,"I'm not a great fan of remakes but you do get the odd one that actually credits something to its original. Carrie is tricky in that it has been modernised somewhat with bullying being online and phones being a tool to attack someone rather than fists. Here I feel the film has a point to remake.The second positive note was the acting from Julianne Moore. I thought she was absolutely brilliant. She was so convincing and brought added life to Carrie's home environment, she just left me chilling at the thought that 'What if She was my Mother?'.From there it started to unravel. The powers that Carrie showed in this feature were sometimes good but at other times it felt more super hero rather than a natural case of telekinesis. So with that feeling held, the horror element began to fade. Chloë Grace Moretz I think did a fair job, but I am still not convinced as to whether her performance was good enough, or even if she was cast correctly for this movie.This film also steers away from the original film and book a little in a couple of scenes and not for the good. It just felt to over-the-top. Satisfying deaths in some scenes leaving you punching the air in support but then at others it felt like an anti-climax.The first half of the film was good but sadly the second half is not so. A tale of two halves I think for this one. Did it need to be remade? Well, on these grounds, No. Sadly, Julianne Moore's character can't carry and dwindling copy. Although I enjoyed it, it was nothing spectacular.GIFT-A-SCALE: 6 out of 14",Carrie
319,yourmumisawhore,Definitely won't be watching this again!,2,2 July 2015,"Being a fan of Stephen King's work, I feel very obligated to write this review. The original workings for 'Carrie' came out in book form,written by Stephen King in 1974.Anyone who has read 'Carrie' or any of his books,will know it's a classic. Now,my problem with this reboot is that it is nothing like the book,or the original 'Carrie' in 1976. Of all the reboots of 'Carrie', this is the worst!Everything is wrong.The character is nothing like the book.Like the original.The acting skills were not too bad,mainly from the character who plays Carrie,and also Julianne Moore.Other than that,the acting was lame.The story was still based around the original,but failed to keep up with key points that were in the book and the original. I don't wanna say too much for those who have not seen this and wish to. It doesn't surprise me this film is so weak though.There aren't many modern horror reboots that even compare with their originals. 'Carrie' was a let down for me,and I will not watch it again. And I suggest you don't waste your time.Keep to the original.",Carrie
320,meltonc,Nice way 2 screw the franchise. Horrible and then some.,3,13 May 2017,"Just watched this and couldn't watch it all - - appalling to say the least. The original was way way way better, and still can scare the wits out of you today. The movie people today do not know how to make a really scary movie, they get too caught up with sex and aesthetics and cheap affects and parlor tricks when we have better CGI today to make it great, but they overlook the acting abilities. These actors are horrid. The Lead - she's good but she's not great, and she's still bubble-gum actress and has some work to improve, but Sissy was way way better and more convincing along with her cast. You don't get drawn into the story, you don't get drawn into the characters, it's like someone watched Final Destination movies and took pages out of those movies -- horrible. The acting is B at best. The storyline is too quick, you don't get engaged, they made a popcorn bubble-gum joke movie in the end which ruined the Carrie Franchise.",Carrie
321,montagenow,When remakes go wrong,5,16 October 2019,"Everything is wrong about this remake. First, you can't pick a Carrie who looks better than the girl picking on her. How will that work? Second, you can't turn Carrie into a witch, which it was more like than the telekinetic Carrie. Third, rolling off the former, it felt more like watching something from JK Rowling when they did the telekinetic moments--fake and syfy. Fourth, the acting isn't good, not even by Moore. No one did their character justice. Moore has that eerie look as the original mother but that's where the good comparison ends. Fifth, the gym teacher is supposed to be prettier. Sixth, the atmosphere just didn't feel like it would ever pull you in. Seventh, this is why we beg for originality and for Hollywood to start looking outside of Hollywood for writers and ideas. They have remade us into the ground, and each remake gets worse. This is why I no longer go to the movies except once or twice a year now.",Carrie

323,radulovicka,Just watch the original instead...,4,6 January 2014,"Disclaimer: this movie can prove to be ""scarrie"" for those who are not a fan of the horror genre in general. For those of us who are, at least for me, this movie was everything but scary. First of all, when I heard that Chloe Moretz will be taking the role of Carrie, I was afraid that she might not be able to pull it off. In fact, the only thing I was pleased to hear was that Julianne Moore will be playing Carrie's mother. She is a great choice for the role but the way she handled it, as well as everything else about this movie is - over the top. I could sense the idea of wanting to make a good remake of a classic, but in the end they just missed it... Chloe Moretz is a very good, promising young actress, I don't even wanna talk about acting abilities of Julianne Moore, but they just didn't seem real here. What makes the original Carrie truly disturbing is that it's really slow paced. In its essence, it's a drama about a teenage girl that is being deprived of an ordinary teenage life and experiences that come with it due to her fanatically religious and psychologically extremely questionable mother, to put it lightly. And yes, the plot is pretty much the same and everything, but the general feel is that they rushed it. As I said, everything is over the top, the acting is exaggerated, the relationships between the characters are unconvincing, but it's biggest flaw is that you KNOW what's coming. You have Carrie doing her telekinesis stunts from the very beginning. It's almost as if she was practicing this skill from waaaaaay back, making pencils float around the room, flying the bread over to the toaster - you know, the usual stuff. So when the real thing was supposed to happen, the x was out of the equation making it quite frustrating to watch. It seems to me that, to make a remake of such a classic film you need to put so much thought and effort into every little detail to make it at least convincing enough, if you're not aiming to top the original. This movie seemed like someone got the idea ""hey let's make a remake of some classic horror movie... hmmm... which one should we pick... the Exorcist? no, that's to heavy. hey, how about Carrie? Sure! it has a young girl as a lead, we sure have plenty of those, and there's a mother - oh, no, don't tell me? are you thinking what I'm thinking? JULIANNE freakin' MOORE!"" And off they went with their brilliant idea and messed it all up. It was to hasty, it was thoughtless, unconvincing and at the end all I could to was to pick the flaws as I was comparing it to the original. I could go on and on about which aspects of the movie I disliked the most, instead I'll just give it a 4/10 and never watch it again. The 2013 version, at least.",Carrie
324,joex-94,A decent movie with a lot left to expect,6,14 October 2014,"I'm a fan of Chloë Moretz, which is basically the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. Having not watched the original I cannot determine whether this remake is appropriate or not, and while I can honestly say I wasn't really impressed, I wasn't disappointed either. As expected, the two leads (Chloë Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore) gives pleasing performances. I'd also like to give credit to Ansel Elgort for giving a completely fair, though not revolutionary, role performance as well. You'll find the characters they play presented in the cast overview of the film. The story is decent, but with little to no surprises, and the most satisfying part about the movie is the ending, though I'll not spoil it for you.All in all, a fair movie without any form or revolutionary storytelling or character performances, even though said categories still does their job. It leaves a pretty mediocre mark, but if you like splatter- movies with a good teen twist, then this movie is worthwhile, at least one time.Final rating: 5.5/10 (but since that's not possible, it receives a 6)",Carrie
325,skullz3181,Everything's just not quite right with Carrie,6,9 January 2014,"At first I really enjoyed the film, the acting is great and most of the CGI parts aren't too bad. The problem with this version is that some parts just aren't cutting it and they are the parts that matter. 1. The first thing is the prom scene, the part where Carrie goes all rage-quit on enjoying her prom was somewhat cheesy. I just think they should have at least attempted at capturing Sissy's insanity from the original. She stood there with that terribly creepy face barely moving, but in this version she is floating around and the CGI was too over the top and just ruined it. They had the right idea though they made it more action oriented and could have went all out with it.2. The ending. The ending seemed like laziness, it's like they copied the original and made a terrible version of it. When remaking a film and novel the audience wants you to capture the essence of the original not copy it, which sort of contradicts my previous statement at how I think they should have kept Sissy's original prom performance. I don't think they should have used the same routine but something equally as creepy as she was in the original, not gyrating all around as she does in the new one it just didn't work.Now this film does do a few things right that the original got wrong. It does keep the strong feeling of bullying and torment Carrie goes through, I just felt that this film pulled that off quite well as does the novel but not the original film. Another thing that I liked better was the car scene much much better than the original where she just flips it over and goes on she does a little more in this version...All in all it's an OK film, it has a great setup and potential but ruins it with bad parts that should be the best in the entire film. I just think this could have been so great but it was just OK...good potential wasted, but I'd say it's worth a watch if you're interested in the differences between this one and the original.",Carrie
326,rossmccarthy1990,More like a DC Comic book villain origin story.,4,15 March 2021,"Not a patch on the original. Much more like a superhero type movie.

327,thenameuwishuhad,Not Perfect But Decent,10,20 October 2013,"It's obvious to see why this movie was going to get a March release date and it should have been released earlier. The biggest thing this movie suffers from is that everyone considers it a remake, not a retelling. The original Carrie took the novel and tweaked it. This new Carrie does the same thing but sticks more to the novel. It's hard to live up to the standards set by Brian De Palma and Sissy Spacek but Kimberly Pierce and Chloë Grace Moretz did great with what they had.My biggest problem with this movie was the awkward soundtrack. At times it really set the mood and at others it was distracting, even worse during the last shot before credits. The other thing this movie suffered from was the cinematography. It had interesting angles and at most times the lighting was good. Then in other scenes the lighting gave off more of a TV movie feel rather than a Hollywood film.The actors were great. Chloë Grace Moretz was much better than I expected. Julianne Moore was great at playing an over the top religious psychotic mother. Judy Greer did her best. All of the other supporting actors who I had never heard of also did well: Gabriella Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Alex Russel, and Ansel Elgort.The CGI isn't as wretched as everyone says. Sure it could be better but it was decent in most scenes.This was a good movie. There's no way to live up to the original but it's definitely worth watching.",Carrie
328,RinoTheBouncer,A Great Film with Little Imprefections,10,6 December 2013,"Carrie is an important film to today's generation. Forget the supernatural elements and look at it as a message. Today, bullying have become a serious case for many people and now that irresponsible teenagers use social media as a way to attack anybody they desire without facing any consequences, not to mention how some students physically bully their 'different' classmates just because they're different and eventually get away with it because of their 'powerful' and defensive parents or by teaming up with other students to justify the act or cover up or candy- coat the truth.Another side of the story is the victim's parents. Sometimes life at home can be really difficult for a misunderstood teenager. When the parents have completely different beliefs or ideas from you and they end up forcing you to become what they want you to be and it ends up hurting your image at school, among your colleagues or your own perception of yourself and self-confidence.In this film, Carrie is a beautiful young lady with an religiously-insane mother who considers a lot of natural and normal things to be sinful and forces her daughter to pray and beg for forgiveness even for having her own menstrual cycle!The complete difference between life at home and people at school makes Carrie torn apart between two worlds in addition to her special supernatural, telekinetic powers that she's born with, creates an atmosphere of tension, insecurity and seclusion for the beautiful young girl. She is not a criminal and there's indeed nothing wrong with her. She is a victim of her mother and her society. The mother who pictures the world to her and her own existence as a sin that she should forever beg for forgiveness for and society and specifically several classmates of hers who broke her psyche apart and creating a monster out of a beautiful young white flower.The film portrays how something so innocent and beautiful can be pushed to their limits to give birth to a monster who cannot differentiate between the kind and the cruel people around her.If we try to translate this film to a more realistic version of it, it can be easily understood. Let's say the real-life Carrie is a lonely girl at school, some sort of an outcast with parents who have high expectations for her, students bullying her and her need to be normal with other people who cannot accept her among them that she can no longer believe that any form of kindness is sincere or out-of-love and thinks that behind every action there's a conspiracy and that's of course, not her fault but her environment's fault.Now talking about this film in comparison to it's previous versions, do not compare. Watch this is a new, original movie. You will not be scared of this one more than the old one because when you saw the old one, you didn't know what to expect, let alone being much young with much less experience with the horror, psychological, supernatural thriller genre. It is also not a film about a girl that kills people, nor a girl that has special powers. It's more about a girl who is victim of her society and the effect of bullying and society on an innocent being.Watch it with an open heart and mind.",Carrie

331,candelariahunter,"A remake of a Stephen King novel, that tells the tale of a young girl going through changes, and to add on to that, she has powers.",8,27 January 2014,"If you don't know already, the story revolves around Carrie White (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is a shy awkward teenage girl who gets her period for the first time and is scared. She is teased/ tortured by the other girls in gym class, which is where it first occurs, and is soon told it is a natural thing by her kind gym teacher, Ms. Desjardin (Judy Greer). Carrie then has to ask her abusive, over-protective, paranoid mother (Julianne Moore), who believes that Carrie's period is caused by the sinful lust, why her mother didn't tell Carrie about her changes. As an effort to try and keep Carrie in line, Carrie's mother forces Carrie to pray for forgiveness, but as Carrie discovers that she is becoming a woman, she discovers she has telekinetic powers. In my opinion, I thought the film was good for a remake. The actors were very good, and the story tells a great tale of a teenage girl in a modern day setting. I honestly never compared how surprised how Chloe played the butt kicking Hit-Girl once, but the two are very different, which is a good thing for a teenage actress. The special effects are good and don't play too big of a distraction when they look CGIish. For the negative things, I have to say is the teenagers' sense of humor. Okay, I know how high school is, and there are some sick people, but overall, as a movie that is to telling this specific story, it gets my vote. Hopefully any other horror remakes can play off like this. I would advise you BUY this and watch it with your friends.",Carrie

No matter how strange she could have acted there is just no getting around her cuteness.

337,parkergolding,"Technically well made, but unremarkable",5,11 October 2016,"It seems something of an obligation to dismiss remakes out of hand these days. Many of us do so with such confidence that we'll condemn the film in advance of its screening. Kimberly Pierce's remake of Carrie isn't an insult to De Palma's original; it is, in fact, an adequately performed, well-filmed picture, but one cannot help escape the inevitable baggage that comes with this film. It doesn't hold a candle to De Palma's original, which wasn't - if we're being honest - really scary, but elevated by the director's flair, enthusiasm, and stylistic excess. Visually, this film is inoffensive, but that's it's problem: it's flat and uninspired. Chloe Grace Moretz is fine as the lead, but the script lets her down. In the original, Carrie (Sissy Spacek) reacts to her powers with bewilderment; hers is not one of awe and wonder, but a kind of fearful curiosity. Here, Carrie takes to her telekinetic powers with verve, gleefully levitating objects around her bedroom in moments that would be right at home in Matilda. The character of Sue Snell, who opts to redeem herself, is thinly written, as is her boyfriend, Tommy Ross. Chris Hargensen, who was played to perfection by Nancy Allen in the original, is more fleshed out than one would expect, but her interactions with her conspirators and Sue Snell seem, for want of a better expression, off. Astonishingly, it is Julianne Moore, a truly exceptional actress, who is miscast here. Piper Laurie was central to the original's success, playing on the absurdities of her character's dogmatic lunacy. Moore plays it straight, which, to her credit, is a departure from Laurie's performance, but it is wholly unconvincing. The third act is a technical and dramatic misfire; it's all pyrotechnics. The pig's blood that ignites Carrie's - if you will - baptism by fire is of major significance. It's that moment when the film's fascinating relationship with the absurd and the horrific boil over. De Palma knew this and executed with gusto; Pierce does not.",Carrie

I was expecting a more ""pink"" kind of movie, exploring more the teen anguish angle and feeling and stuff. Wrong. Lot's of blood. In the end, the things weren't so pink, Mama.I used to think that the reason why remakes are bad was because they don't respect the original source. I was wrong. Carrie respects the original like hell, only brings some modern elements to that universe. Even so, end up being a weak movie.It's hard not to compare the Carries. I like Chloe Moretz a lot. But she doesn't convinced me as a shy teen with issues. Her voice is pure confidence and she is adorable, cute. Sissy Spacek was so convincing in every scene. And no actress will ever look as good as she did covered in pig's blood.But wasn't casting the great mistake here. I think the biggest mistake here was the overuse of Carrie's powers. The great thing about the original was that at a certain point you would forget you were watching a movie about a paranormal girl. The original focused more in the teen anguish and the excitement for the prom. A underdog girl having her day at the sun.Sadly a woman director decided to forget the feelings and focus in blood. And delivered one of the most tasteless moments of creative freedom. The final scene is tasteless and unnecessary, unnecessary like Sue's pregnancy. But that final scene alone doesn't ruin the film at all. It's just a bad way to finish a weak, yet effective movie.It's not a bad movie. Although the last scene were ridiculous, it didn't ruined it.

I know the bad ratings here are mostly voted by the trolls that are still defending the 1st movie. Well, this movie is made for the 'younger' generation, I suppose. (I'm sixteen) My friends and I (about 20 people) watched it and we agreed this is WAAAY better than DePalma's version.Yes, Sissy Spacek was an amazing,creepy Carrie. But like what Chloe said on an interview, this movie is bringing the emotional elements more than 'the creeping' elements. it is meant to make u feel SORRY for Carrie instead of scared. And Chloe's beauty didn't bother me at all- I read the novel, and to me, what Stephen King described as 'Carrie' in the book was pretty much like Chloe Moretz. Carrie was actually a pretty girl, but slightly fat (yes, Chloe is slightly fat), has luscious lips (Tommy Ross realized this when he first looked at Carrie closely, and Chloe Moret'z lips are REALLY LUSCIOUS), has zits (take a look at Chloe in the movie, the canteen scene where Tommy asked her to prom, you can see few zits on her forehead), and most importantly Carrie was described as a 'short girl'(Which Chloe fits perfectly, since she is indeed, a short girl)The acting were good as hell, Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz nailed the complicated-and-hard-to-pull-off love and hate relationship between masochistic mother and an outcast teenager. I enjoyed the sadism of Margaret White there, and Carrie White's innocence, which seem to me didn't exist in DePalma's version AT ALL. The CGI's pretty cool, I enjoy the prom scene very much. I really felt sorry for Carrie when the bucket of blood dropped on her (and the dropping scene was awesome too). The CGI also made Chris's death thrilling. and the climax when Margaret tried to kill her was also an amazing heart-pounding scene. The tension was so perfectly build, and Margaret's death was also A LOT BETTER.However, I don't really like the ending. The Alternative Ending was a lot better.The only good thing about DePalma's version was Sissy Spacek.Feel free to disagree with me. This is just a high-school-kid-made review, anyway.And no, this Carrie isn't a horror movie.It's a movie about a very horrific sadist tragedy that's probably not gonna make you scream the hell out, but can company you through a thrilling ride from start to end.",Carrie

There are so many things Stephen King writes in his books that are left out when made into film so I was hoping that Carrie 2013 would not so much be a remake as much as it would try to expand on an already classic film. If there is no attempt to expand on greatness and an apparent dismissal of classic elements from the original film, they shouldn't bother at all with these remakes.There were fine performances by Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz, but I found myself often remembering the great cast the original had. the original also didn't have to resort to the obligatory teenage sex scene since it relied on genuine creepiness and fright. In the original, Carrie was so delusional that she thought EVERYONE, including her gym teacher, was ""laughing at her"" when her gym teacher actually wasn't. The original took time to display the madness in the climax. The remake was just in a hurry to show off its' CGI toy box which didn't show anything original really.The classics of the 70's and 80's were classics because of the writing. If Hollywood could write today mixed with the fine SFX of today, remakes would be A-OK.",Carrie

Then the mother says ""This is why we've had to move place to place so much."" So she was homeschooled while going to sixth grade while moving place to place. -.-Next, they call her boobs 'dirty pillows.' Really? Did they need that amount of filler that they through that into the final cut of the movie.Chloe Moretz, I love you, but you should not have been in this. She had this weird walk through the whole ending, as if getting covered in blood makes you walk all weird. They tried to make you feel for the character but no one was buying it. They kept calling her Carrie White through the whole thing and...I FELT NO PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS CHARACTER!!!Lastly, there is a part at the end where it rains rocks down onto a pregnant girl who doesn't react like it's happening at all, yet earlier a guy is killed by a bucket. EXPLAIN THIS! Firstly, why is it raining rocks? Where are the rocks coming from? Why aren't they hitting the pregnant girl? Why doesn't she even care that she's in danger? This movie is stupid.

I had high hopes for this film more gore, being truer to the book rather than the original film and a good revamp. Well i was very disappointed they could have made this film a hit but the only difference between the 2 films is language and the use of mobile phones and computers. The writers should have read the book and they should have focused on that and then it would have been an epic film. Julianne Moore played Margaret White brilliantly she definitely captured the character creepiness and insanity.

She portrays the shy girl perfectly and it was just a matter of time before she got a role like this.Julianne is fantastic as Margaret White. She's creepy, insane and just so sadistic at times. The way Julianne portrays Margaret White is one of the best performances this year.Sue is different this time, caring more deeply for Carrie, this time being portrayed by Gabriella Wilde, an young English Actress.Ansel as Tommy is great, the newcomer actor portrays Sue's boyfriend brilliantly. With a mix of the book and 1976 film, Tommy is a more sympathetic character.Portia Doubleday as Chris. Evil, and I mean EVIL! Chris is way darker pushing it so far to the fact that she is amazing as the role.I loved Judy Greer in this film. She cares a lot for Carrie and that's what I like to see, sympathetic until the very end, Judy makes Miss Dejarden fantasticSo this film is Perfect in my opinion, mixing Horror with Drama its gets the rating of a10/10!For more reviews check my profile daily",Carrie
346,emmaibbitson,This is when a remake works.,10,20 March 2017,"After reading the reviews - I have to ask, are these people on the same planet? I've just watched this and then tried to watch the 1976 version. How can anyone even compare the two -(that's not a question awaiting a response). Just take the car accident with John Travolta and then the one from this or the Prom Night from the 76 version and this one. The overly long dramatic scenes that could of been cut down instead of torturing the viewer. It's my opinion that the people reviewing those who think any remake is doomed from the start and are obviously Steve Mcqueen fans, state that ""Bullit"" features the greatest car chase in existence (The car chase sequence in the comedy ""Short Time"" beats ""Bullit"" a hundred times over)and that ""The Godfather"" is better than ""Goodfellas"". Maybe you should consider dumping your Betamax collection and opening your eyes, or just keep your basement views and opinions to yourself. The Director has done a fantastic job and deserves the credit that none of you see fit to grant. It's a very rare thing these days to see ""exact"" camera work which has been planned before-hand rather than the ""fly on the wall"" - ""Bourne Ultimatum"" camera work.",Carrie
347,d_gulliver,WHY?! However...,5,10 October 2014,"I really just don't get it. Why on earth do film companies insist on remaking flawless classics? I know it's the easy way to make money, as it guarantees viewers, but really, why make it almost scene for scene. Is there any point at all? Well, since there's absolutely nothing we can do about it but pray, I may as well review this title.If you have seen the original, you're gonna have high expectations, right? If you haven't, then please go and watch it before you consider watching this. (Sadly there will be a lot of youngsters who think this is the original) OK, so I can start by saying that the script follows the original almost to the letter. Great, because then we avoid terrible one liners, and cheap dialogue, or even worse, awful comedy factors that make you wish you had telekinetic powers so that you could break your DVD player without having to get up.Instantly, if you've seen the original, you know what to expect from each scene, so you are already aware of what is happening in EVERY scene, and even the lines that are gonna be used, so you looking for something else, something that makes it stand out from the original. So what do you have? It's new. New means computers. If you've always craved to see how powerful Carrie actually was, then you'll love this. You can take a front row seat to witness the raw and utter power of the girl, and what she is truly capable of is beautifully demonstrated and does have you muttering ""bloody hell"". However, I felt that this was demonstrated far too early on in the movie, and instead really should have been kept until the famous climax at the end, with only teasers leading up to that.The cast were just OK. The mother didn't come even close to terrifying me, and was far too tame. I didn't feel she was manic enough. I feel that if they are going to remake the classic, try and at least get the scariest character right. There's a reason why Carrie snapped: in the original it was her mothers upbringing style on top of bullying, but in this one, it just seemed like it was because of her period and bullying. I also felt Carrie was a little too over dramatic during the massacre at the end, with the slow breathing and arms held out like she's trying to constantly hug the earth.Surprisingly the action wasn't over the top. There were a few awful slow mo shots, which ruined the flow of things a bit. It's pretty much the same as the original, although the school scene is a bit more brutal and detailed, including the car scene, which is verging on sheer torture.It's really difficult to review a remake, but all in all, i've seen worse. They really could have destroyed it, but they didn't. If you want to see the power of Carrie re-imagined and made more brutal, then yeah go for it. But it lacks the horror of the original completely, and is certainly not one to remember.One thing is for sure though, after you've watched it, you'll be sitting there trying to move things with your mind. Don't it doesn't work.",Carrie
348,rfrench5,Updated and Not in A Good Way,3,7 February 2015,"The original ""Carrie"" from 1975/76 still is the scariest horror flick I've seen. I'm 50 years young and I remember as a 13 year old seeing this in the theater in Southern California. It was crazy. At the end, the entire audience shrieks and screams for a few minutes and many of the teenage girls were crying. It was that good. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie's scenes to this day are some of the best in all of cinema. Ever. Piper is just so good and so bizarre and convincing and weird. Point on.Sadly, this remake really isn't scary, or good. Chloe and Juliane have none of that chemistry. Margaret White wasn't weird or scary. Carrie Ann White isn't the freckled shy little fawn. For me, the Margaret White character is what really ""makes"" this movie. This remake really captures none of the glorious scary horror of the original. I have to say the best scene in this remake is the scene with Carrie and Kris Jorgensen and the windshield.",Carrie
349,mateosuperkick,I enjoyed this more then most apparently,8,22 November 2020,"I thought this movie actually had the best mother of all the movies, the only mother close was the mother in the 2013 Carrie musical.

350,warith-niallah,"The Carrie Remake has to be viewed from two perspectives; ""Seen the 1976 version"" and ""Never Seen the 1976 version""",8,20 October 2013,"As a stand-alone motion picture for a person who has never seen the 1976 version, Carrie (2013) is an excellent piece of work. It has a complete story that moves at a good pace. No questions are left unanswered, and there's even room for a sequel.As a remake of De Palma's Carrie (1976), it does not own up to how he mastered the screen. But we are asking a lot for someone to equal a master of cinema while not allowing the newer Director creative license. Viewing Carrie (2013) as a stand-alone picture views Carrie White as a modern young teen with a mother with serious mental issues. This picture accurately portrays how brutal young girls in high school can be, tells a great, but tragic story, and displays an angry teen seeking well deserved revenge using her powers in a fashion true to be an amateur, by using her hands and twisting her body to make her telekinetic energy obey her. Comparing Carrie (2013) to Carrie (1976) – Well – You are asking a director to match the cinematic beauty of De Palma. Let's look at some selected comparisons. In Carrie (2013), it was explained that Margaret White birthed Carrie alone; this explains when Margaret was telling Carrie that she almost gave her back to God near the end. She could not have contemplated murder of a newborn in a hospital. (Subject to artistic interpretation, because she could have murdered her after she arrived home)In Carrie (2013), Carrie White used her hands and twisted her body to use her powers as demonstrated in the prom; accurate for a young Carrie, whereas Carrie (1976) had mastered her skills and merely needed to look in that direction to cause an action; implied by a mature Carrie in the 1976 version.Carrie (2013) was angered by what happened to her, and her mind remained sound. This is why she levitated her teacher (Ms. Desjardin) before electrocuting some students, keeping her alive versus Carrie (1976) where her mind was broken, and she snapped and murdered her teacher (Miss. Collins in 1976). Cinematic differences; in Carrie (1976) De Palma in true form portrayed the entire prom scene as the bloody bucket fell with no dialogue (one of his trademarks), other than when Carrie's mind broke (""They're gonna laugh at you. So sorry Cassie"" – repeated), the scene is silent with musical score only. Also, no one can ever match the power of the split screens De Palma portrayed. The screens split, showing Carrie's power and result of her rage, along with creepy clear/focus of Carrie's stare as she takes her revenge on the student body and faculty. (The clear/focus is another De Palma trademark)In Carrie (2013), Carrie White floated out of the gym, a really nice touch.The dream sequence – De Palma's sequence (Shot in slow motion reverse) is ""untouchable"" (pun intended), which is probably why Carrie (2013) didn't try to match it. The 1976 dream sequence still makes my skin crawl to this day. The Carrie (2013) dream sequence, well – as expected for a commercial 2013 motion picture – my personal issue with the 2013 sequence – Make's Carrie look like a bad person; which she wasn't.Conclusion – See them both and enjoy them both as stand-alone works instead of a remake.",Carrie
351,daneyko-136-948900,Carrie is More of a Victim of PC and Miscasting than her School mates,1,21 October 2013,"How can you make a movie about a religious fanatic, who does not live by the Holy Bible (outside those passages that are Politically Correct)? There is no reason for this girl to walk about school with her head pulled in like a turtle--she is not ugly (as she was in the book)nor plain (as in the 1976 film)--indeed she looks as if she could rival the 'pretty' girls for their boyfriends. At home the only tension is that her mother will hurt herself--something she seems to do without any provocation from Carrie at all--so what is Carrie afraid of? The 'talent' on display in this film is questionable at best. Moore (someone like Anne Hathaway, or Tay Diggs, that Hollywood keeps pushing on us, despite any modicum of visible acting skills)humiliates herself when she finds Piper Laurie's shoes too big to fill. The girl play Carrie--hopelessly lost--and even those surrounding the central cast are only pale imitations of the talented group appearing in the original. But it is Political Correctness that really kills this version. While rated R--for violence--the film does not merit an R. Kids--in real life bully kids--not here, the extent of the bullying here is a cheerleader's chant of 'Plug it up'. So with no tension, no action (save CGI prom) and no talent on display, why bother?",Carrie

353,shirah-daniel,Far more satisfying than you would expect from a remake.,9,21 October 2013,"I saw Carrie on Saturday, expecting a somewhat sad attempt to change the story into the way the director visioned, and I was blown away. The film follows all the major plot points, without making it obvious they were doing so. The film included small things that were very iconic in the original film, like the creepy statue of Jesus in the closet, and Carries mother referring to her breasts as ""Dirty Pillows"". The film also follows the novel somewhat closer than the original. For example, during the prom scene, Carrie uses her telekinesis to cover the gym floor in water, then electrocute the floor, setting a trap for anyone who was trying to escape. To escape the electrocuted floor, she uses her telekinesis to lift herself in the air and glide through the gym, escaping safely, and leaving the gym in flames, yet, in the original, she illogically walks across the electrocuted floor, unharmed. It was small parts like that that made such an impression on me. Chloë Grace Moretz did an amazing job, considering she had to fill Sissy Spacecks shoes. The reason that most people aren't as fond of the film as me, is that it's a remake of such a great movie. I can't say it's better than the original, but it's at least equal to the original. I highly recommend seeing it in theaters. The prom scene won't be the same on a smaller screen.",Carrie

356,Bwcfilms,Should be renamed Sabrina Teenage Witch,4,18 January 2014,"They're many things that can be said about this movie, and a good remake isn't one of them. The biggest problem for me is the disconnect between Carrie and her mom. I would've loved to see more of their troubled relationship develop on screen, and more back story, leading to her mother's death. Like why is the mother so religious? who was Carrie's father? etc....I also felt the director missed the mark big time!!! by not giving Carrie some sort of outcast demeanor besides being shy, which is not believable for one sec with the too cute ""Kickass"" Mortez. It seemed as if she let the actors do whatever they wanted on screen, as long as she got the shot and moved on to the next scene in the script. And the supporting cast was just awful!!!! The girl who played sue was more like a run way model, rather than a do good teenage girl. And the girl who played Chris....just shot me already.Nothing about this film made me care about anyone on screen. There was no build up, big pay off, or heartfelt emotion after 90mins of watching. I would say you're not missing anything by missing this film. Save yourself the disappointment and watch an episode of Sabrina the Teenage witch for better time.",Carrie
357,CarrieWhite2013,One of the best films ever! Heartbreaking like no other & much better than the 1976 version!,10,6 May 2014,"This is the best film I have seen since in 21 years. That is how incredibly good it is. This is the MOST heart-breaking film imaginable, INCREDIBLY touching and one that makes ANYONE with a heart feel the biggest humanly possible amount of empathy and sorrow for its main character, who is abused by everyone..... If this film doesn't break your heart, you don't have one.I was not even interested that much on watching it when it came out, as I didn't think that it would be better than the 1976 version (which I used to like a lot), but once I saw it I realised that this one is better on every single aspect: acting (specially by Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore, who are both phenomenal), directing (by Kimberley Peirce), screenplay (mainly re-adapted by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa), score (incredibly haunting by Marco Beltrami) and special effects. And specially, like the masterpiece book by Stephen King it is based on, this film makes you FEEL for poor Carrie White, while the '76 version nauseatingly tried to make you feel scared about a poor bullied, innocent, sensitive and damaged soul who had been horribly abused by everyone around her for her whole life.Thus, this version stays far closer to Stephen King's 1974 book than the '76 version, including on the character of Carrie itself, who is far more vocal on this version, just like in the book (which I have just read). Also, Chloe Grace Moretz looks far more like the character in the book (as described by King himself on it) than Sissy Spacek, which looks nothing like the character, and acts far better as well.I find this film extremely timely and important in terms of showing the horrific effect (as seen on the character of poor Carrie, which goes past breaking point due to the abuse received) of one of the most devastating acts someone can go through: bullying. In this film, Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to retaliate against her bullies, but this only differs from real life in the use of that ability instead of firearms, with the latter being used on so many high school shootings, where bullied kids go past breaking point due to the abuse they take and decide to retaliate against their abusers and end their own lives, as they feel these are so miserable they aren't worth living. Like one of the characters in the film says about Carrie: 'We pushed her, and you can only push someone so far until they break'. The theme of the film is even more timely these days as bullying has gone past the school or high school and into the internet, where it goes on 24/7.",Carrie
358,thorne316,Carrie (2013) The anti bullying PSA we didn't ask for,5,18 October 2013,"I really hoped the new Carrie remake was going to hold a candle to the original, unfortunately it comes off as almost an ""after school special- esque"" anti-bullying PSA. I think Chloe Grace Moretz did phenomenal for what she was given but everyone else (including Julianne Moore) came off really cheesy. Moore at one point is trying to be all serious as she's playing a religious nut of a mother and tells Carrie to change her dress as she can see her ""dirty pillows"". It got one of those very unwanted chuckles from the theater crowd at what should be a tense point of the film. The worse part of it for me was the editing. As Carrie begins to lose it during the prom, her eyes switch back and forth from normal green to black, to 1 red with 1 black to green again. It's as if they spent many days shooting the same scene and just went with whatever contacts they had available, then when editing came along no one caught it. She also at one point gets stabbed and at one point the wound is in the center of the spine then mysteriously moves over to the shoulder. I was tolerable and good for a matinée price but that's about it.",Carrie
359,stormyweathers255,Not bad,6,21 October 2013,"I was very iffy going in to see this movie. My first big reason was Chloe Grace Moretz,her portrayal as the bada$$ superhero Hitgirl from the film KickAss will forever be branded in my mind. If someone mentions Chloe instantly I'm thinking Hitgirl. So my question was can she go from this smart ass, potty mouth, kick butt superhero to a completely opposite role that is a timid, shy, isolated, and abused young girl?My decision was made to see this movie when I saw Kick Ass 2 and Chloe's Hitgirl was made into a more vulnerable character. This got me thinking okay maybe Chloe can pull this off.So I'm sure you all know the story of Carrie but if you don't here it is:Carrie is an isolated misfit who is bullied and tortured not only by her highschool peers but her super crazy religious mother as well. she slowly begins to discover that she has telekinetic powers and when she makes an effort to fit in by attending her highschool prom disaster strikes and Carrie unleashes telekinetic terror on all who wronged her. First of all because I already knew the story of Carrie I expected this film's climax to be all the more devastating (in a good way). What I mean by that is I have to be so emotionally involved with the characters that I will pray against fate that the tragic climax will not happen. Did I get that here? Yes. I wanted Carrie to have a good time at the prom, I wanted Carrie to have this chance at being ""normal"", and I wanted Carrie to be happy for once. But then the rug was brutally slipped from under her and I felt it too. Chloe really surprised me in this movie because let's face it the girl is just damn cute and according to Stephen King Carrie was described as being chunky and pimply so the girl was ridiculed for being socially inept as well as physically. Miss Chloe here was just too damn cute and giving her a messed up hairstyle and baggy farmer's clothes couldn't hide it. A minor thing but I forgave this because of Chloe's acting. I swear this girl has some brilliant facial expressions especially during certain scenes that really pull at your heartstrings. I even found myself getting a little misty eyed at some parts. As for Julianne Moore as Carrie's mom, no complaints here. I loved her and Chloe's scenes together especially towards the end. Nearly tore my heart in pieces.Now as for the climax. By the time the pigs blood falls on top of her this film implies that Carrie is not only in full consciousness of her power but that she is enjoying it. You know this because she only kills her tormentors. In the previous films: Carrie 1976 Carrie is aware but it is implied that her perception is completely off therefore everyone becomes a target, her tormentors as well as the innocents, and in a way this was scarier. In Carrie 2002, Carrie blacks out. Though I liked the idea of her being aware of her power and enjoying it the fact that she only targeted certain people kind of took away from the tragedy of it all. I think it would've been better if everyone had been a target because I think as the viewer you want her to get back at those that wronged her but to watch her kill innocent people too just kind of makes you want to say ""Enough Carrie stop!""And speaking of Carrie's power ""Holy CGI Batman!"" it looked like a scene straight from an X-men movie especially with Chloe waving her hands around and looking crazy. It was almost cringe worthy. The final few minutes I think will stay with me the most especially with Chloe's delivery of the line ""look at what you turned me intoI killed my mom, I'm scared, I want her back!"" that line gave me chills and it hurts to even think about because I can still hear the pain in her voice when she says it. What kind of took away from it was Carrie telling Sue that she was pregnant and it's a girl as the house is collapsing all around them, which to me was kind of unimportant at the moment. We could've just skipped that and jumped to Carrie shoving her butt out the house.Overall it was a good movie, not great, but watchable.",Carrie
360,kevinsmit1998,"Very bad, was looking like an actual love story",4,14 January 2014,"I have to say that this new Carrie is a shame for the old one. I expected a lot of more action and joiness in the new Carrie due the invlation related to special effects and so. On the other hand the story was a kind of bad, I am not finding any horror inside this movie for the first hour, somehow I thought I was watching the wrong movie. But I was not having another moving close with Chloë Grace Moretz in it. Also this movie gave me a feeling of watching a clitché high school movie for the first hour. After all this was a shame for the old Carrie, although I have to say that Chloë Grace Moretz was acting great.",Carrie
361,dwfyfe1,NOT a re imagining,6,12 December 2013,"I tried. I tried to put Brian De Palma's spellbinding 1976 masterpiece out of my mind while watching Kimberley Pierce's remake, but I could not. There are several reasons for this, not the least of which is that in many ways it is so similar to De Palma's version that for a great deal of the running time it comes close to being the kind of shot-for-shot remake of 'Psycho' that Gus Vant Sant foisted upon audiences in 1998. Another reason and an entirely personal one, is that De Palma's version was one of the films that kick started my love of cinema. Another is that De Palma's version is so deeply rooted in cinema history as one of the best teen horrors ever made that comparisons are an inevitability. That is not to say there is nothing to enjoy here. The fact that it follows De Palma's version so closely will be a source of comfort to some but made me wonder why Pierce bothered to remake such an iconic film at all. For those of you either too young to know the original or who have been living under a rock for the past 37 years, Carrie White is a shy high-school outcast, bullied by her classmates and berated by her fanatical, God-fearing mother, Margaret, for constantly reminding her of her own sinful past. They live in a creepy dark house on the outskirts of town and Carrie has strict instructions to go directly from home to school and back again. In one of the opening sequences, Carrie is the victim of a particularly humiliating and cruel attack by her classmates, led by the popular high school bitch-on-ice, Chris. This awakens a power in Carrie which it is later suggested was always there but had, until puberty, been dormant. One of the classmates, Sue, is so overcome with guilt at her involvement in this event that she talks her football star boyfriend into taking Carrie to the Prom. What followed, in De Palma's version, was the most riveting, suspenseful, heartbreaking and technically near perfect 20 minutes of cinema I have ever seen. In this version events leading up to the prom, and the prom scene itself, feel rushed. Both versions have similar running times but De Palma's feels like it takes its time more, you feel like you know the characters better, you feel sorrier for Carrie and that is part of the reason the Prom scene works better. Watching De Palma's version, you just FEEL more. This version comes so close to being a better film it becomes a bit of a frustration. Giving Margaret self-harm tendencies works beautifully, and Juliane Moore pulls off Margaret well, but really, how could anyone better Piper Laurie's towering, terrifying Margaret? There have been suggestions that Moretz is too pretty to play Carrie, I disagree. She has precisely the same mousy type transformed into prom queen quality that Sissy Spacek had, but again, Spacek just made us FEEL more. During the prom scene, Carrie's pupils dilate, she takes a deep breath, she levitates briefly, and you really FEEL her rage, but it doesn't last long enough. Rushed. Pierce, to her credit, has been more faithful to Stephen King's novel (which I never much cared for-I always thought De Palma's film was the rare occasion when a film was better than the book). She uses the gym teachers name from the novel, Chris's father makes an appearance, Sue is pregnant, and in the most frustrating sequence of all, when she could really have let loose, she only hints at Carrie's destruction of the entire town (the trailers had me salivating at this). I was also hoping that Carrie would kill her mother the way she does in the book but that would probably have been deemed not cinematic enough.This remake of Carrie is a good film, but it could have been and comes so close to being so much more. On the off-chance you've never seen the original and you like a solid thrill you will enjoy it. There was a 2002 TV version which wasn't bad too. If I were to suggest the way to watch all three, I would say watch, in order of quality, the 2002 version, then this, then De Palma's.",Carrie
362,iridiansun-818-12011,Lacks Fire,3,26 October 2013,"For me this remake is shallow and draggy. Chloe Moretz and Julianne Moore i felt were not at their best. On the other hand Judy Greer, Ansel Elgort and Gabriella Wilde did a better job, Wilde especially stood out from the rest. I found myself hoping for more between Elgort and Wilde than Moretz and Moore. Unlike the original Carrie this movie definitely lacked fire even in the fire scenes. Having not enough substance and bite this Carrie did not disturb as it should,i sat there feeling bored and hoping the movie would end soon. Not being a good suspense or even drama movie, i am not sure i could recommend this to anyone except those willing to waste precious time. The 3 stars are mainly for Greer, Elgort and especially Wilde.",Carrie
363,ericknupp,"Good movie, though I expected more...",7,6 December 2013,"I'm a huge fan of Carrie's. She was my hero when I was bullied in childhood and most of my adolescence by school mates. I must've seen the original a thousand times and read the book up to 7 times when younger. When I got to know that a new, more faithful to the book remake was being filmed, my expectations were as high as they could be. Wow, would I really see what she did to the town?The movie just debuted here in Brazil and, after months of anxiety I have to say the movie was good, but... oh boy, I expected so much more.As opposed to Piper Laurie's more comical and theatrical Margareth, Moore's portrayal is simply scary and more psychologically dramatic and disturbing. Moretz's Carrie is astonishing. Carrie is simply alive, but perhaps a little less shy then Spacek's Carrie. The acting was terrific, no doubt about that. THUMBS UP!One thing I thought as soon as the movie ended was how fresh Peirce made this remake. Carrie steps in the 21st century and it becomes her. The students really look like teenagers (because they actually are, which was not the case with De Palma's - Spacek was 30!!!) and you can really feel what they feel. There is a youth in it, which there was not in De Palma's version. You can get inside the movie and understand everyone's motives and drives. Raw, young, deep and very life like.About the plot per se, lots of expectations were seeded with the promo material, but some of them did not come to life. The 1st trailer shows Carrie in the midst of the town in flames. That never happened. They didn't show the destruction that takes place, but made us think they would by what was shown in the trailers. Very reduced here.""You will know her name"" I thought they were relating that to the fact that in the book, people would know telepathically Carrie's name while she passed them by, creating the whole havoc. Never shown either. They even said ""Flex like Carrie"". Every time she used TK, the word ""flex"" came to her mind in the book. Though not good, 2002's version shows more destruction. Carrie's anger was so much lessened in the movies.Overall, it's a good movie but, I don't agree with the media saying it's more faithful to the book. It's more De Palma's Carrie then Stephen King's Carrie.",Carrie
364,countgrim,Easier to watch and more entertaining than the original.,8,21 April 2015,"Im aware of the many reasons why most people claim they dislike the remakes of classic movies.A big part of the audience/reviewers are probably 35 years old+,so they were actually raised watching those old classics that ""haunted"" their teenage dreams.They have ""bonded"" with those horror oldies,and watched them again and again throughout their lives.There are also the guys who just like to trash anything new and for some reason think its more sophisticated and ""cool"" to like the originals better. Im in my mid 20's,and like many others have a passion for horror films,but its a fact that sometimes its hard for us to relate with 70's/80's movies. We didn't have the chance to experience that wonderful era,so we have no nostalgic feelings towards whats seen in those movies.We don't know the actors,we aren't familiar with the environment,and lets face it,we were TRAINED by today's film industry to like better graphics,better cinematography,more realistic special effects,and sometimes...better acting. Its really hard for us to get thrilled or even REMOTELY SCARED by those old movies,simply because of the way they looked and were made.Unfortunately,effects and tricks they used 40 years ago cannot impress anymore(except maybe for historical or nostalgic reasons)Its much more believable for us to experience a bullying scene including teenagers filming each other with mobile cameras and then posting the humiliating videos than watching 70's teenagers making outdated jokes and trying to act cool.It was probably believable back then,but not anymore.This remake of Carrie has it all-good acting(both from the protagonist and of course from J.Moore).The main character plays perfectly the role of a shy,introverted girl that society views as a ""freak"",all this mostly because of her unhealthy upbringing by her terrifying religious fanatic mother who is magnificently portrayed by Moore.""Carrie"" is such a likable girl in this movie that you often sympathize with her for all that shes going through.The actors who play the ""bullies"" succeed to look like a bunch of hateful douchebags,thus making the revenge-Prom scene more fulfilling and satisfying.The film is full of ""delicious"" horror atmosphere and upsetting images,not because of jump-scares or ""scary"" CGI creatures appearing,but because of how disturbingly insane the mother acts towards her daughter(and even her own self),how she punishes her to enforce her dark,ignorant ideas,and even the house gives out an eerie chilling vibe.The plot might indeed have some weaknesses,like how exactly did she get her telekinetic abilities and stuff like that,but this was the case with the original as well. The story of Carrie isn't some magnificently twisted innovative script that will begin a new era etc.Its a catchy,well made horror flick with some creepy atmosphere,nice action-gore scenes and a solid plot that can satisfy newbies and old comers as well,while it isn't looking to reinvent the wheel.Great acting by well known actors,believable gore effects,beautiful dark scenes,up-to-date take on the issue of bullying that today's audience will be able to relate to.If you haven't seen Carrie yet(neither this nor the original)i highly recommend to watch the remake first:better picture,better acting,better special effects,all these equal more entertainment!!",Carrie
365,Fr0zenMunky,Pleasantly surprised,8,29 January 2014,"OK so I'm not entirely sure if this review contains spoilers but I thought I'd warn just in case. I'd read reviews and heard from a lot from people that this remake wasn't up to scratch, so as much as I tried not be, I was a little disappointed before I'd even watched it. But it didn't take long for that to change, thanks to little details that I think even the original was slightly lacking on. For example, the principle is exactly how I'd imagined when I was reading the book, as small a part as it was, I was even more pleased with him than I was watching the original. It sounds like just a small detail, but I think true fan of the book and the original will really appreciate that they've went to the lengths they did to find the perfect balance between the book, the original film and the modern day.Without giving away too much, I loved the use of technology and social media in the movie, as much as it strays from the original, I was glad they'd taken that step towards relating to a newer generation. Also the soundtrack was quite recent, but alternative enough for it not to take the edge and almost 'grodiness', that the original had, away.Ofcoarse it isn't going to have the tense simplicity that 70's & 80's horror had, because nowadays we are not very patient and as much as it is part of the charm of older movies, we cannot get away with those sorts of drawn out frights anymore. So I wasn't surprised by the added special effects and gore that the original strayed from, however I was quite happy with the way they'd went about it, it's bloody enough that you get your fix, but not so gruesome that you think you've accidentally walked into final destination. So before I write a review so long no one could be bothered reading it, I wanna finish by saying I was pleasantly surprised at how well the casting worked out and that It'd be hard to think of people better suited now that I've seen what they done with their roles.If you like the original and the book, give it a go anyway, you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was. If you haven't seen or read either, what have you got to lose? It's traditionally modern enough to satisfy everyone I think!",Carrie
366,britbike2002,Surprisingly Good In Almost Every Way,8,3 October 2018,"Being a fan of the original 1976 Carrie, I was skeptical that this remake could pull it off. As we all know, the vast number of remakes out there are actually worse than the originals by several orders of magnitude. However I was simply not disappointed by this newer version of the older King classic. The first thing that stood out to me was the impeccable acting, especially on the part of Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. Their performances absolutely pushed this movie way beyond where it would've been otherwise. The acting was not only completely convincing, but propelled this movie like a freight train through a long dark tunnel. The other triumph in this movie is the cinematography. The camera angles, lighting, movement and balance were all near perfect. They added significantly to the anticipation and suspense. Combined with the soundtrack, it added to the power of this movie.Overall, I highly recommend this film, especially on a big screen in surround sound...",Carrie
367,mrs-a-hoffman,Lacks the punch of the original,3,15 December 2014,"I watched this hesitantly because I am a big fan of the original Carrie and not a fan of Carrie 2, but I thought I would give it a whirl. It's not so much that the movie was bad, it's more that it lacked any real punch. Trying to modernize the story, it would seem odd that Carrie can use the internet at school to learn about telekinesis, but not about her own body. It was believable in the original Carrie that Carrie would not know about her period unless her mother told her, that was before sex ed became a normal part of school and pre-internet. Now it just seems unbelievable for Carrie to be so in the dark about her own body.Also, the timelines don't match up. Was she home-schooled or not? It appears others have known her since 6th grade, but how could that be when she was supposedly home-schooled all of her life?Honestly, none of the characters in the movie move you in any way. You're just there, watching things unfold instead of being a part of the film and wanting nothing more than for Carrie to be able to fit in, like you did in the original Carrie. In this adaptation, you can hardly even tell why they make fun of Carrie - she's not that awkward (although they try to make her seem so by putting her hair in her face in every possible frame), she's not ugly - she's merely the victim of a religious zealot mom - and even that doesn't have the punch of the original.Finally, in the original Carrie, her powers were mostly unknown to her, new and untested. When she finally unleashes them, it's hardcore, unforgiving, and does not care who it reaches. In this adaptation, Carrie plays around with her powers, trying them on for size, and when the infamous prom scene appears, there's no surprise, no punch, no, ""holy cow"" moment. It's very lackluster and when it ends, it simply ends...you feel nothing for anyone in the movie. It just wasn't good.",Carrie
368,CayleyMJohnson,Better than the original?,8,1 February 2015,"In my completely honest opinion, this movie surpassed the original Carrie by a long shot. Did I like the original? No. Do I like Steven King? No, not really. Did I think this movie was going to suck. (Because let's face it, most remakes suck) Yes. Was I pleasantly surprised? Absolutely. I feel like everyone...scratch that, every horror lover knows what Carrie is about, but in case you don't know; Carrie is about a girl named Carrie (clearly, I feel like that's given) who has no friends. She's tormented all the time in the worse ways possible, and has an abusive (I feel like that's the wrong word to use but because her mom hit her with a bible, I'm gonna use it) mother who is an extreme believer in God, Jesus, the Devil, Heaven, Hell, etc. Carrie discovers she has the power of Telekinesis. This guy asks her to prom (his girlfriend, Sue, asked him to) and their prom date goes sour when she gets pig blood dumped on her, and she sets out to seek revenge on those who tormented her. This movie is great. I believe the tormenting that is done to her in the locker room in the beginning of the movie is a bit extreme (understatement) and the bullying that happens throughout the entire movie is a bit extreme (understatement yet again) In the movie, Carrie has a gym teacher that slaps her and keeps her job. Ummmm okay? I know it's a movie but how did she not get fired? Seriously? I've always believed that Carrie is a complex character. She doesn't talk a lot, so for Chloe Grace Moretz to be able to pull off that character is wonderful. I feel like not a lot of actors or actress would be able to pull that off. So hats to Chloe Grace Moretz. Overall this movie was great. Was it weak in certain points? Yes. Was it strong in other points? Yes. I highly suggest you watch this movie.",Carrie
369,citruspanda,"Not Bad, But Could Have Been Better",6,21 June 2016,"When I first read a Stephen King novel, which was a couple of years ago, I realized that with an author like King it has to be very difficult to capture his imagination on film. The novel wasn't Carrie, it was the Tommyknockers, but the idea still applies. In 1976, when the original film came out, that was about as close to the original novel that anyone was going to get, and Brian De Palma did a magnificent job turning an amazing novel into an amazing film. But can that be repeated? The answer is, unfortunately, no. Carrie (2013), while not quite living up to the original, is still a decent movie on its own, and would likely have seemed better had it not been faced with its predecessors. The 1976 film was opposed the same way, but with less pressure. When Stephen King released Carrie in 1974, he was still a new and up-and-coming author. The original film was held to a less strict standard than this recent remake. But let's talk about the movie by itself. It was good. Yep. However, that's pretty much all that comes to my mind. Not horrible, not so egregiously poorly made that I never want to even hear the name of the movie again, like some people seem to think. But also not amazing. Not so amazingly outstanding that it is my first choice any time my friends and I have a movie night. But it is, invariably, good.First, I'll talk about the good parts of the movie. The acting was great, really quite good, but only with the two main characters. Chloe Grace Moretz is a and outstanding actress, and the same goes for Julianne Moore. Two outstanding actresses in two very difficult and complex roles. The supporting actors/actresses did an OK job as well, but nothing outstanding. Next comes the story and plot line. As to be expected, the story is quite decent. But you can't really go wrong when the mastermind behind it is Stephen King. However, even though the story is already existent, it can still be difficult to execute it well, and this is the case here. The movie starts out interesting, and compelling for sure, and the ending is very well done. But the fact is, the middle section was fairly boring, and you will probably find yourself rather tired of the movie and looking at the clock to see what time it is. There is only so long the characters of Carrie and her mother can carry the movie. I say this because Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace Moretz did such an amazing job with their roles, and that can't really be said for everyone. Right there is where the movie takes a fall. Acting is one of the most necessary things in a movie, and Carrie just can't quite deliver on that front. And honestly, that's one of the only bad things about the movie. However, without good acting, a movie can take a serious hit, and that is what happened here.But despite this, the ending result was a rather average movie with varying levels of interest. You are brought to sympathize toward Carrie, and it really is a heart-wrenching story. The realness of Carrie's surroundings is something we can all feel, and most people know what it feels like to be left out and ostracized; it is a fear we all have. Because of this, I give Carrie a 6/10. If I were you, I would rent the movie to make sure you like it before you put forth any money for it. But hey, that's just me.",Carrie
370,headsgrowback,Exhilarating and one of my favourite movies,9,1 April 2017,"More than likely an unpopular opinion, and more than likely people will call me insane or media illiterate for this review. I admit to being insane; I tend to like movies that a majority of people don't. But hear me out.Carrie, starring a young Chloë Grace Moretz as the title character, is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name, and they are both based on Stephen King's hit horror novel of the same name (it also spawned a 2002 TV film that never expanded into a series). I admit to the 2013 adaptation to being the only form of 'Carrie' I ever watched or read, and that's probably why I love this movie. I don't know very much about the other adaptations, but I'm sure that if I did/was a major fan of the series(?), I would have similar opinions to the actual fans. I do, however, know that people are disappointed by this movie because there was a lot cut out (there is/was a petition for an extended cut to be released) and by the fact that Carrie looks nothing like she was described in the book. But, let's be honest, who's gonna watch a movie with a hideous main character?The reason I love this movie so much is because I'm completely new to it (and even the horror genre), so I know nothing about it so I have nothing to be salty about for this movie in regards to the original material. And I'm almost sure that many other people who are new to Carrie and horror would feel the same, if not similar.As a horror movie, it has plenty of tropes that you'd expect in one: some sort of curse, teens being b*tches, teens having sex. Actually... let me rephrase that: some sort of curse, and teens being teens. Plus a ton of death and blood. As a movie itself - imagine it as it's own stand-alone movie - it's got a character you can feel emotions for, it's got characters you can hate, it's got an antagonist, etc... I'm just blabbering at this point, let me get straight to the main reasons.The movie is dark, brooding and bloody. Carrie's shyness, creepiness and fear are portrayed brilliantly by Moretz and Julianne Moore makes an excellent religious, self-harming, insane mother. And the movie puts a lot of focus on their relationship, but not too much so it's just another family drama. And a lack of jump-scares (or at least it's not reliant on them, let alone major ones) brings a welcome feeling to what most horror movies were in 2013. It's just creepy, and still makes you feel very uncomfortable at many parts - particularly when Margaret White (Carrie's mother) scratches herself or stabs herself in the thigh. I felt many emotions and feelings while watching this movie (excluding my newly found celebrity crush on Moretz) and I'm pretty sure that's what the goal was. As a completely new take on the original film and the source book - or if you're just viewing any 'Carrie' material for the first time - you really don't know what to expect. Of course, though, the highlight of the film is obviously the prom scene. Where the death starts. More than halfway into the film, Tommy dies after being accidentally hit in the head by a bucket after a prank gone wrong after Carrie get's drenched in blood (as a result of the prank) after he and Carrie get nominated prom King and Queen. (""After"" is my word of the day now) That's when sh*t goes wrong, Carrie fully embraces the powers (which I have forgotten to mention throughout this whole review - she has telekinetic powers which she discovers) and goes ""f*ck you"" on all the teens and some teachers (while saving/sparing Miss Desjardin - because she was kind to her - before electrocuting most survivors). It's notably more brutal and exciting than the other prom scene adaptations (I have seen those particular parts on YouTube). Blah, blah, blah. I can't go on too much as I'm limited to so many words, a lot of people will probably disagree with me provided anyone even reads this review of a 4 year old movie. All I do know is that the end (with Sue Snell providing a statement as a voice-over as she places a rose on Carrie's grave) makes me want a sequel so f*cking bad... I'm probably gonna cry if they don't make one. Carrie is still alive, f*cking do something with the fact! Ugh... anyway. I recommend this movie to any new horror movie goers, anyone new to 'Carrie' (most people would recommend the book and 1976 movie first and I wouldn't blame them). I know that a lot of people wouldn't agree with me, but a 48% score on Rotten Tomatoes (44% Audience score) does tell me that there are some people that can appreciate this movie.To conclude: This has definitely reached the list of one of my favourite movies (despite the fact that I'm not a complete horror movie fan - mainly because of jump-scares and their reliance of them). I'm NOT gonna watch the 1976 version (might watch the 2002 version) and might read the book... but the only reason I'm reluctant is because I love this movie so much that if I do, I'll change my opinion of it. Nevertheless, give it a shot. It might be worth it.",Carrie

Given I hadn't seen any other version of this story, or read the book, so everything was new to me. But I was instantly intrigued. I sat on the edge of my seat for the entire movie and I thought everything that transpired in the end was very satisfying. I thought this movie was so good that I wanted to watch the 1976 version later, but since I had this 2013 movie fresh in memory, the original movie was pale in comparison. But I can understand if you have watched the 1976 movie before that this is not as good to you, this new movie hits much harder if you ask me. I know I will re-watch this movie many more times!",Carrie
373,Primolander729,Beautiful tragedy,10,15 September 2016,"The thing that confuses me most about this film is the way many people see it. They call it an 'unnecessary remake', 'awful' and 'carbon copy unoriginal'. They're mistaken. This film is exceptional if you have an open mind and are seeking only to be entertained. There is not a dull moment in this remake whatsoever that would make be believe the collective negative perspective. The beautiful cinematography, the score and the well selected actors carry this film from beginning to the very end. I was a bit skeptical at first because Moretz doesn't seem like that kind of girl that would ever have any kind of problems like Carrie did in this film. I thought it would be very unrealistic to see a hurt girl like Carrie being portrayed by a very beautiful women like Moretz but I was mistaken. Moretz did deliver the role from her shy demeanor to her demonic rage to her repented fear. She was Carrie.I applaud the film because when the credits started rolling I felt this strange feeling of emptiness inside of me. I felt sad but the beautiful kind of the sad, the sad that makes you really think about things from a whole new perspective. This movie is a beautiful tragedy to its core and ends in a way that makes you understand that some people live and die hurt and alone. So to all the haters out there, I forgive you and to all the first timers that are skeptical to see this film, watch it. You will definitely be entertained and you will enjoy the ride.",Carrie

375,joeman-12,A lessen version in every aspect,4,6 August 2018,"What to say... this movie is a remake of the original, copying every aspect, but done poorly, cheesy and less credible.
In the original movie Carrie was a shy girl with notable low self-steem and very insecure of herself. Devote to christiany, mind-forged by her mother who raised her with fears and beliefs that shaped her mind and personality.
In this movie, Carrie stands for herself, has a personal view of things, argues with her mother as if she felt she knew more about the world. Unafraid of her powers as a chliché of an x-men. She extends her hand and uses her power as if Xavier taught her and flys, yes, flyes and rage use it. Fine for an x-men movie, where characters are spectacular and do stupid stands and unrealistic moves, just because they look cool (but nobody would do if actually had those powers)
The mother in the original movie was a fanatic religious marvelous played, very believable and coherent to the character. 
In this movie the mother also behaves strange and incoherent to her part. A religious woman hitting her head against the wall like an autist?
Every scene that shapes the movie was the same you will find in the original movie. The remake is the ""cool"" version, where everything is unrealistic, less apealing and exagerated and forced to make a scene that feels out of place. 
My advice, watch the original 1st, then this one and make your own conclussions",Carrie

It does build the story (maybe a bit too much) but Chloe Moretz does a wonderful job in the title role. It isn't quite a remake as it includes a lot of modern technologies (such as mobile phone use) but some of the stuff that happens will resonate with kids who are bullied in school and how truly evil some people can be. It does show the bullying quite well and this is very real for many teenagers throughout the world. If you forget about the original flick and take this on its own then you may well enjoy it!

380,PatrickShow,Give it a chance without comparing to original or a novel,8,26 January 2014,"Yesterday I decided to watch Carrie despite I haven't seen the original 1976 movie. I usually don't compare the old versions to the new ones, I want to give the movie a chance to impress me without any prejudices about how the original version was made. At the beginning I was like - no wonder they make fun of her and laugh at her when she acts like a total weirdo. Pull yourself together girl and maybe it will get better. Then I realized she has a psychopathic mother so basically it's not her fault. She would like to be normal, she would like to fit in but her mother wouldn't let her. Throughout the movie I realized I'm quite enjoying everything what was going on. In some other review I've read they reproached that by the middle of the movie we already knew what's wrong with Carrie, we knew she was different, she had some powers and that producers didn't save this shocking discovery for the prom scene. Well I have to disagree because we knew all that even before we started watching the movie thanks to the Stephen King novel and the previous 1976, 1999 and 2002 movies. That's why I didn't consider it for the flaw. The climax at the prom was perfectly done. I was rooting for Carrie to get her revenge. I loved everything about it. I loved wires, flying tables, fire. I loved how she managed to control her powers. Chloe and Julianne were both great. The ending was a bit confusing for me that's why only 8 of 10.",Carrie
381,MissNirvana95,Carrie: A must-see horror film!,7,27 October 2013,"Even though, I haven't read the book since I was in 6th grade, the movie did remind me so much of what was in it. With the beginning where Carrie starts her period till when the house collapses into the ground. It was one of the best movies I have ever seen in movie theaters. I was impressed by how well the actresses and actors performed their roles. I feel like Julianne Moore and Chloe Grace deserve Oscars for their performances as Margaret and Carrie White. I advise people to read the book before watching the movie (unless you're the type of person who can watch movies before the book).For the first hour of the movie, there really isn't anything scary going on. It's just a bunch of bullies and Carrie's mom being the insanely conservative Christian woman that she is. Of course, the part where they dump the pigs blood on her is when things start getting intense. The prom scene in general can startle anyone, not to mention the very ending to.I feel like they could have made it a little bit scarier even though I did leave the movie theater shaken up. It leaves you with thoughts of what could possibly happen if you bully someone enough to their breaking point. The movie itself to me, was very epic and I encourage any Stephen King fan or just any typical horror movie fan to watch this awesome remake of the 1976's classic.",Carrie

I am so tired of seeing ""remakes"" of films that only have the characters names in common with the original. Stop calling an orange an apple just because they are both fruit. The personalities of the characters were portrayed very well with enough extra insight into Carrie and her discovery that kept a fan of the original movie entertained for the duration of the movie.

383,changwei3037,5 reasons of why I prefer the remake,8,21 October 2013,"I think it is unfair to say that the remake will never be as good as the original. I don't prefer the newest one for no reason; actually the storytelling of the 2013 Carrie is to me, the best among all three. The reasons being that it provides the space for actors to better building their character, it has a more sophisticate approach to deal with the issues (bullying, religious fundamentalism, family issue, etc.), the story line is clearer, a better cinematography, and of course, much better special effect. Personal characteristics: When we saw Julienne Moore using seam ripper to stab her leg, when we saw the scratch/scar in her arm, and when we saw Carrie's reaction when she heard that the school was going to call her mom, we can easily feel the complex relationship between Carrie and her mom. The previous two versions did not give us any sense of how much does Margaret White love her daughter; there was so much love, maybe too much, was given to Carrie, but we never noticed that before. In the scene before the prom, while Carrie locked her mother in that tiny room, she said ""I love you mama"", suggests that she didn't have a strong feeling of hate, but rather a sympathy to her mother. So far, Julienne Moore is the best Margaret White, but this does not suggest Patricia Clarkson, also a very good actress, was not acting well in 2002's Carrie, I believe it was simply because there wasn't too much acting in the 2002 Carrie. As for the 1976 Margaret, probably the director (Brian De Palma) didn't really know any religious fundamentalist. Storytelling approach: The water volleyball scene in the beginning (not the very beginning but the beginning) of the 2013 Carrie was as good as the 1976 beginning in the dressing room; I really can't make a choice between these two. But there were many other subtle settings or takes that tell us the whole story of this event. For example, the scene while Chris Hargensen's father was threatening the school that he was going to take legal action, we knew that Chris Hargensen's father has a questionable parenting approach. Also, there were several scenes that were focusing on the social activities of those school students, and these built up what a nowadays high school probably is. And there was a very important scene in the laundry in which Carrie's mother was working demonstrated how the relationship Margaret had with the society; in the 1976 version, it was demonstrated by a scene in Sue's home where Margaret was trying to convince Sue's mother to go to some sort of religious event. And in 2002 version, while the director (David Carson) was attempting to use the flashback method, he probably failed to process the most important element, the characteristics. Storyline: I have to say, a horror movie is a horror movie, there is nothing we don't understand in a horror movie. But if you do think about how reasonable the story can be, you will than watch the movie differently. If you think about how fast a girl can walk in the night, you will know there was no way Chris was driving toward Carrie (she should have gone already). And things such as why Carrie's mom wanted to kill her daughter or why Sue was going to the prom with her boyfriend being with Carrie are both points that are relevant to the storytelling. And it is obvious that the 2013 version has done more work than the previous two. Cinematography: Maybe because Kimberly Pierce is a female, or because her version is newer, or simply because they got a better cinematographer/team, the cinematography of the 2013 Carrie is, from my point of view, the best. When you see Carrie floating/flying toward you, that's what I'm talking about. Special effect: Special effect is a technology thing, so I don't think anyone is to blame if something doesn't look real. In fact the special effects, which were used in the prom scene, in 1976 Carrie were already very good if we use a 70's standard. But I have to say the violin (scary) sounds and frame moving part (sorry I don't even know how to describe that ""thing"") were so annoying in the 1976 version. In terms of the 2013 version, the special effects were well-done; the car crash scene was, to me, delicious If you are a special effect lover, you will hate the fact that there weren't many killing scenes. For the 2002 version, oh I have to say it was creep, I mean, too bad. So yes, my favourite Carrie (the movie) is the 2013 version. But strangely my favourite Carrie is Angela Bettis, not Chloe Grace Moretz, not Sissy Spacek, even though her acting was almost perfect. It is very interesting that Chloe is the most persuasive actress for this character, because Sissy was 27 in 1976 and Angela Bettis was already 29 while she played the role as a high school student, yet Chloe didn't look like a victim of school bullying (she is now only 16) at all, not because she is not good at acting (see ""Let Me In"" and ""Hugo""), but maybe because she is too strong in terms of personal characteristics. By the way one, she said she never watched the 2 previous versions, so the Carrie in this version was totally her own style. By the way two, beauty does not have any effect on the possibility of being bullied. And Obviously Julienne Moore is the creepiest Margaret ever; there is no doubt about her acting performance. (But I still want to say I actually expect more from Kimberly Pierce.)",Carrie
384,samrosenbaum-823-417674,A tradeoff between this and the 1976 version,6,20 October 2013,"I know I'm in the minority in having disliked Brian de Palma's 1976 version of ""Carrie."" While liking 90% of it, I absolutely hated the over-the-top religious symbolism in the final scenes, which undid the rest of the film for me. For a long time, I assumed that was Stephen King's doing, but it turns out that the book ends very differently, and the fault for the film's ending lies with de Palma and his screenwriter Lawrence Cohen.Kimberly Pierce and her script doctor Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa have not changed the story from the 1976 film as much as I hoped they would, but they did remove its most offensive element. That was the crucifix with the glowing eyes, which implied that Carrie's death via the house sinking into the ground was divine retribution. Without giving away exactly what happens, I'll say that the new ending makes better use of the character Sue Snell, although missing an opportunity that presented itself in the novel. And the final shot suggests that Pierce may make good on her claim that she sees ""Carrie"" as a superhero origin story, by having her heroine return somewhat like a character or two with similar powers have in ""X-Men."" What Pierce's new version lacks is directorial style to compare with de Palma's, and a score to compare with that of Pino Donnagio. The main reason to see the 2013 film is for the performances of Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore, who act circles around everyone else in the cast, and whose characters are better developed than their 1976 counterparts. Pierce is definitely more sympathetic to Carrie's plight than was de Palma, whose film sent mixed messages.So, for me, the 2013 remake of ""Carrie"" is a close call, but I'm giving it a marginal recommendation, because it does, though only in part, fix what I found wrong with 1976 film.",Carrie
385,nafisfuadkhan,"Very wonderful film, all in all",9,4 November 2013,"Being different is not a curse, being powerful is not a curse, the real curse is not being accepted by the society, the curse is not being neglected by people who are weak inside. Carrie is a wonderful movie expressing that aspect which is not talked about often. This movie might be supernatural. But the theme is real, persons like Carrie are real. We might laugh at them, make fun of them but when we get to know the true power of them, the only thing we do is become amazed. Overall, this movie filled up my want from it. Truly loved the movie. But I also looking forward to watch the Carrie(1976) movie......... truly ""You will know her name""",Carrie
386,dafater,This is such a nice comedy and a film that makes you feeling satisfied by the end,7,28 October 2013,"Before I begin, I must say that I'm a horrible person. Having said that, here's my penny.I went in to see this film because I wanted to see Chloe Grace Moretz. I found her somewhat attractive after watching Kickass 2. I just find her smile and her lips desirable, even though she is technically not a hot chick. This movie to me feels like the high school scenes in Kickass 2 got its own spin off movie, especially with the casting of Chloe as Carrie. It was so satisfying in the end when every asshole dies and the people I wanted to see surviving survived. It's the same satisfaction I got when Hit Girl uses that stun rod thing to make those gossip queens throw up, they had it coming. I like how the movie uses practical effects (not all though, this is 2013 we are living in after all), such as when Carrie makes a few books to float with the force. By the end of the movie, it felt somewhat short though, probably because of the good stuff was at the end and it was short relative to the run time, but I'm alright with that no biggy. There's only one problem I really have with the movie, the last scene with Carrie's grave stone cracking (which by the way, is CGI!) and Carrie's scream after Sue puts a flower there. I don't get it. Who cracked the grave stone? Why is there Carrie's scream? Is Carrie not dead? Is her brain waves using telekinesis to crack the stone? It just felt cheap and it ruined the mood I should have had, which is complete satisfaction.I also want to mention that this film is like a reflection on American society nowadays. Carrie's mom is the red neck Christians, like that dude who caused his daughter's death by refusing to take her to the doctors. That girl Chris and her boyfriend are the morons who watch too much Jackass. Chris's father is the rich corporate asshole who thinks he can get away with anything because he's rich. The high school is your everyday American high school with constant bullying. And Carrie, the bullied who got pushed too far and kills her school mates. (school shootings anyone?)",Carrie
387,gabriel21777,It was just fine,7,3 January 2014,"It was just fine for me,i think it was little bit differently than original back in 70's but it has good atmosphere and keeping you sitting and watching till the end. Comparing those movies we are seeing that they don't have many common elements but to someone who is watching for first time 'carrie', will be thrilled by the remake. Original was great for sure but in this one,also acting is very good with good standards. Many times i had read bad reviews for some movies but in the end when i watched them,there were above average or great ones. Anyone must see and judge after watching. My rating is 7/10. So,give it a try,it worths watching it:)",Carrie
388,vampireprincess2312,Meh. Kind of disappointed.,3,11 February 2014,"I, of course like the mass majority of people have seen the original, Steven Spielberg, Carrie. Being a fan of the original film I was pretty excited to go and see the much anticipated remake. Well after a long wait, I finally got to see this version of Carrie and I was DISAPPOINTED. First of all, the casting was amazing. The wonderful Julianne Moore, who is always so beautiful by the way, as Mageret, Carries over religious and quite frightening mother. And one of my favorite actresses, Chloë Grace Moretz, as the title character Carrie. So of course upon seeing that these two incredible actresses were going to play the lead roles, I was more than psyched. But after seeing it, I don't really think the original needed a remake. Carrie is a horror genre classic. This version had some creepy scenes but I actually prefer Sissy Spesecks Carrie, she was a way scarier Carrie. No need to give plot details as I'm sure you know them already. But lets do some comparisons shall we?Okay, number 1. Chloé Grace Moretz is obviously a more believable teenager, along with the rest of the cast, than the original obviously older cast.Number 2. I did enjoy the big climax scene in the remake, where she gets the blood dropped on her and begins her killing fury. The cgi affects made it look really cool and I like how Chloé had expressions and a slight creepy smile as she wrecks havoc on her peers and city. As in the original, Carrie was basically catatonic.Number 3. They do throw in something different with Sue, in this one they reveal she's pregnant and its a girl, so Carrie lets her go. I'm not saying I hated it, but I guess I pumped myself up too much and it was a let down. I would watch it again, but a classic is a classic for a reason. Film makers please, leave them as is.",Carrie
389,tm_911,Pales in comparison to the original.,1,2 September 2014,"If you've seen the original Carrie or the first remake, you know the story. This version sticks to the same basic format, but in this one Carrie is really in control of her powers, really aware of them. The prom scene - which is the money shot of the Carrie story - lasted all of a minute, and then Carrie went home and was crushed by rocks, inexplicable, round, backyard landscaping type rocks, like her house is crumbling into perfect round pieces. And what was up with that blonde getting involved so late? Like she doesn't even talk to Carrie until the very end, and then Carrie's like ""you're pregnant"" and the movie basically ends. Hated it. Watch the original, or the first remake.",Carrie
390,macyelizabethhaskett,Better than I expected,9,16 February 2014,"One of the things I hate about remakes is that they are usually so far off the original that I leave asking myself, ""Why?"". However, I thought this remake gave a modern version of the story without going way out there trying to explain everything. I liked the beginning, showing not only Carrie's roots but Margaret's as well. I also liked how Carrie took revenge on the specific people who tormented her (especially Chris) instead of just killing everyone. I was happy to see why Sue really wanted to help Carrie. Not only did she feel bad for what she had done, but she also wanted to give up something that was important to her for Carrie. However, I am not sure why Sue ended up pregnant. That part would have more sense if she named the baby Carrie. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with this movie.",Carrie
391,abigail-doyle,An absolutely terrible remake,1,13 April 2014,"One of the most disappointing remakes I've ever seen. When the original Carrie was first released, it terrified audiences and gave people nightmares. This remake will make viewers laugh out loud as they appreciate the terrible special effects, atrocious plot development, weak acting and poor overall production. This remake had so much potential to be incredibly interesting, but all Carrie 2 could manage to be was a sad attempt to modernize a story that didn't need modernizing. Julianne Moore's performance is disturbing but well-intentioned, and Chloe Moretz does the best she can with the terrible script she was given. The mother-daughter relationship is almost interesting, but falls flat and leaves the viewer terribly bothered to have spent +$5 on such a poor film.",Carrie
392,joao-psic,Another downgrade of a good movie,2,3 August 2020,"I watched this movie twice, just to be sure of it's bad quality. It looks like a parody of the original movie, but it is real. The acting is exaggered and hysterical, but I generally felt no emotion except boredom. I felt sorry for the pig they kill and for Julianne Moore, for being submitted to this role.
If you want to know what ""Carrie"" is about go and watch the original movie. This one is one more remake that does not add anything to the original and it's pretty much a downgrade of the original.",Carrie
393,wahl-jonathan,Not bad...,7,10 October 2014,"""Carrie"" is well cast, and the performances did not disappoint, particularly Chloë Grace Moretz as Carrie White and Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother, Margaret. Chloë certainly makes the role her own, and is a wonderful young actress with tremendous talent already and plenty of potential. Julianne Moore shines, as well. Just as Chloë did with Carrie, so too does Julianne with Margaret, making the role her own. The entire cast as a whole, is effective, but where the issues arise is with the writing.I understand this is a remake, and recreating the original ""Carrie"" shot for shot and word for word would have been a disastrous venture. Anyone who's ever seen the remake of ""Psycho"" with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heiche knows what I'm talking about. However, some of the alterations to the story put a damper on the effectiveness of certain pivotal scenes. For instance, we see Carrie master her telekinesis in this film, much like a Jedi mastering the Force. In the original, Carrie's powers seem to control her when they arise, and they aren't used nearly as much, making them an effective device for creating tension. But not all the alterations are negative. I liked Sue's subplot of being pregnant by Tommy. It allows for a moment between Sue and Carrie at the end where Carrie tells Sue, ""It's a girl"", and Sue seems to have been in denial that she is pregnant. However, the ending of De Palma's ""Carrie"" was more effective with that final scare as part of one of Sue's nightmares as she deals with the trauma of what happened at the prom. Not to mention that dream sequence is so beautifully shot. The look of this film isn't quite as memorable, overall.Right down to the White household as well as the use of CG for the house's collapse, this film's appearance, while it has its moments, isn't quite as memorable or effective. The collapse of Carrie's house in the original was done with a scale model of the house and other practical effects which are far more effective than the CG version of it in this film.Overall, I'd say give this film a watch, but if you're expecting something on par with the original, it's still not quite there. Regardless, this is one of the best remakes of the entire cycle of recent remakes and reboots that have been coming out of Hollywood. I still recommend it. 7/10",Carrie
394,basvanpul,"No suspense, no credibility",3,26 May 2018,"There wasn't a moment of suspense or horror in this movie. Sure, some knives, cars etc flew around and the scenes in the closet were ok, but I never believed the pain Carrie suffered or the way she transformed... this story has a lot of potential, really, but not this way!",Carrie

396,nicbnxrich2000,Carrie for a new generation!!,8,21 October 2013,"I was able to see this film on Saturday with a few friends and I thought it was a really good film. The special effects were well done and the story jogged along at a quick pace and did not have any of the dreaded lull moments that can drag a film down. Considering this is a remake and quite a few people going in will already know what the basic storyline will be, the film held my interest valiantly and did what I would consider an admirable job at bringing the story of Carrie to a new generation. I was a little nervous when I found out that Chloe Grace Moretz would be playing the lead role of Carrie as when I envision that character I always saw her as very shy and plain. Chloe Grace Moretz is one of Hollywood's more attractive young up and coming stars. Sissy Spacek pulled off the role extremely well in the 1976 version of the film and seemed to own the role. My slight apprehension was put to rest as Ms. Moretz was able to pull off the dowdy, shy, anxious and nervous role of Carrie White with great believability. Speaking of pulling of roles, Julianne Moore was excellent as the deeply religious (and slightly psycho) mother that Carrie has to contend with. She was an absolute scene stealer. Piper Laurie was fantastic in the same role in the original version of the film, but Ms. Moore's portrayal was just frightening on a totally new level. I would recommend this film to anyone and hope that more people give it a chance as I feel that this film is a great modern interpretation of a classic Stephen King story.",Carrie
397,koenspronk,Loved every second of it. Awesome!,9,14 December 2018,"Small sidenote: i have seen the original as a kid, liked it but in all fairness I could only remember the prom-scene.This movie was absolutely awesome. Cloë Grace Moretz does an amazing job as Carrie, as does Julianne Moore as the God-fearing mom. I was a bit afraid this movie would go the standard-American-way (loads of jumpscares, bad acting and no substance) but instead I got solid acting, a really great build-up and an awesome climax.If you have just seen the original or remember it by heart: please skip this movie because you will be annoyed by the inevitable differences. But if you haven't/don't: this is a gem, a bit buried by the bad reviews which you can ignore. Will watch again, highly recommended.",Carrie
398,foergun_276,Nice Remake,10,9 November 2013,"I have just watched new Carrie movie and i don't know why people complain about this movie.I have read the book several times and watched the old Carrie movie again several times. I don't accept any complains about the story. Story was good in 1976 and it is still good in 2013. I like the Chole's and Julianne Moore's performance. Especially Julianna Moore is fantastic in this movie.Remakes are hard to like because people always compare it with the old movie. If they like the old movie, they will complain about the new one. This is why this movie has low rating. But they don't understand one point, if you don't remake Carrie, new generation will not know about it at all. How many young person would watch 1976 Carrie? Carrie was one of the best choice to make a remake. It is not like remaking ""Oldboy"" movie (which they did unfortunately).To sum up, i liked Carrie (2013) and it was a good remake. I really enjoyed it because i am fan of the book and the old movie. If you don't know anything about Carrie you will like the movie. If you like the book and the 1976 Carrie movie, again you will like this too. The only way to not like this movie is to have obsession about the old movie (or you are not fan of this kind of movies at all)",Carrie
399,decarli-pati,Disappointing!,3,10 December 2013,"I was really excited about seeing this movie this week and got really disappointed... At some parts in the film the people in the cinema LAUGHED.. so ridiculous it was... not AT ALL a horror movie.. Maybe it's something closer to American Pie.I really hated this movie. It attempts to adapt the story to the ""modernity"" like facebook/youtube stuff in a really bad/obvious/literal way. The main character does a really bad job in this movie, it looks really amateur to me. A little bit to ""hollywoodian"", including the Soundtrack which I think doesn't go with the movie... too literal, too many clichés... They shouldn't try to remake a Masterpiece like first Carrie was (Carrie 2 is terrible too). They should make maybe another story, with another title... not try to recreate something that's already almost impossible to make better.The only thing that saves the movie is Julianne Moore and the actress who does Carrie's Gym teacher.I do not recommend at all.",Carrie
400,sivashankar-99,More psychological less Si-Fi,9,5 January 2014,This movie is shot well at an even pace and the setting is perfect Julianne Moore and Chloë Grace Moretz did perfect justice their characters Margaret and Carrie. The story is well known and can be interpreted many ways and has so much more potential and can be extended in so many different directions. On related note I expected so much more Si-Fi effects I went in expecting the story of a budding telekinetic in her early teens but what I found that the story is more from the perspective Sue Snell(Gabriella Wilde) who feels guilty about teasing the weird girl(Carrie) in her class and creates this elaborate dream in which the girl takes revenge on the whole school. The story illustrates the mayhem it will cause if people started developing Telekinetic powers I don't know about others but I didn't feel time while watching this movie and that can only mean the movie is worth watching,Carrie
401,geoffrygo,Wonderful Remake / Adaption!,9,25 November 2013,"The 2013 movie version of Carrie took a 1970's storyline, and brought it into modern terms without barely even a hint of change in the plot. Well executed, well casted, and beautifully filmed, Carrie will have you on the edge of your seat (especially if you've read the book) waiting and pawing for those last 10 minutes. And trust me, when they come, they do not disappoint. This movie does such a fantastic job showing the antagonists as people who deserve ""what is coming"" that the so insanely graphic method used to show justice being served, hopefully won't hit you too hard. (Pun intended) Overall I would definitely say it is worth a go if you have heard about the storyline or read the book, but this movie is definitely not for you if you are not a fan of the horror / violence genre.",Carrie

You feel every moment but here (2013) it is A Dull Acting Instead.. for times.. You Think they are rehearsing not Acting especially Carrie's mother (Actress Julian Moore) The original movie (1976) was low budget in somehow (you could see clearly how fake the explosion and fake building destruction) but the movie (1976) was very good and very amusing to watch even in today's standard So watch the Original Adaptation (1976) if You need to Watch A movie about Stephen King's Carrie Novel",Carrie
403,carlaeckley,Why remake something that's already great?,4,4 October 2014,"Was this whole mess the fault of the director or the studio? This is a real question, not merely a snarky comment. At the beginning of the remake i thought i would like the updates. But as it kept going i thought someone was missing the point of the story. The original was much more intense. It seemed her wish of being normal and included had come true in such a big way and the profound grief from betrayal and the resulting mayhem seemed to come from such a deep well of pain in Carrie. Her pain sorrow and rage could not be held back. It seemed like the whole point of the remake was to include cgi telekinesis and over the top green screen acting. Carries mom was so bland i felt sorry the people who had never seen Piper Laurie's performance in the original. I feel the over acting is not the actors fault. They were directed that way. So, was it the directors fault or the fault of the studio for wanting these one dimensional characters and pointless fx updates? I do realize that some of the fx in the original were really cheesy but the ones that were well done did so much more to heighten the mood of the film. Not take away from the emotion of it like all the cheesy cgi in the remake.",Carrie

Carrie finds a secret power. Carrie has telekinesis power and uses it to her advantage getting her revenge on the other students who bullied her at school. She is invited to Prom with one of the popular athletes in school, whilst having the time of her life she is humiliated in front of the whole school which sends her over the edge and from there wreaks havoc.I enjoyed the film and think it was worth the watch.",Carrie
405,dragonfaire,No. Just no...,1,28 February 2014,Leave it to Rehash Queen Chloe Moretz to make yet another bad remake. She just can not act. What a horrible movie. It makes me like Julianne Moore just a little less and that make me sad because I love her. Julianne Moore is awesome in this but even she can not save this POS from the likes of Chloe Moretz and her terribly poor acting. If you liked the original do yourself a favor and just watch it again instead. Chloe Moretz is just NOT at all a believable Carrie. This is not the first horrendously bad remake Chloe Moretz has made. That should have been my first clue to skip this atrocious remake. She also did a remake of a fantastic Swedish film called Let the Right One In. Neither of these movies required a remake to begin with but to further diminish and demean the film by casting a talentless hack like Chloe Moretz is unforgivable.,Carrie
406,xxmrsqueenxx-263-658326,Horrible Remake,1,29 November 2013,"There was so much cut from this movie that it just seems poorly edited and mismatched. Chloe is no Carrie, for one she is too beautiful to be Carrie. I couldn't believe that they would have cast someone that beautiful for the role of Carrie. Carrie was always odd looking or had an odd look about her, Chloe was miscast. The characters were boring and flat. I felt that Chris, was supposed to always be a vindictive mean cold hearted girl, but in this movie, she seemed nicer and not much cold hearted at all. I couldn't believe how they could say this was better than the original, when it wasn't even as scary or creepy as the original. This faded so far from the book and original story line that it all just made no sense. They even cut the shower scene, a scene that I always thought was a key point on why Carrie was so mad at everyone to begin with. The actors didn't even pronounce the gym teachers name right. Seriously? The co-stars couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag. This has got to be one of the worse remakes I have seen in a long time. If I was Chloe, I would be embarrassed!",Carrie

408,geniusboy_95,Not worth it. Unless you're into the pathetic vengeful teen with superpowers kind of Movies,6,28 November 2013,"I just watched this movie ""Carrie"" today. And i gotta say it was so much less than i expected. For the movie itself the superficial plot is so corny. When it comes up to a revengeful girl wanting to get back at her friends is somehow overdone. But thats just not what the story is all about. Carrie has some other symbolic connotations embedded within, as to religion and the pervasions of liberal mentalities away from Christianity ,for which it could wipe away some of the clearly in-horrific sceneries that are somehow close to being shear superpower display. Carrie was devoid of lots of technically intricate scenes necessary for the whole movie's well being. What bums you the most about the movie is that even that you know it ends, you keep craving for more, expecting more,desiring much more baffle and perplex in the course of events begging it would twist things out. But unfortunately nothing happens. Just when you think the director has a chance of coming up with a brilliant move he just falls right in the tacky old already used climaxing events.The movie as a whole is just futile, Not worthy. But for someone having no other option its alright, pretty Watchable.",Carrie
409,deviantdizzy,Ugh,2,26 February 2014,"Maybe I expected too much from this movie after loving the original years ago, but imho, this movie wasn't enjoyable in the least.. The chick who played Carrie was too pretty and her portrayal as Carrie was not believable. (AT ALL) During the prom scene, her movements were jerky (kinda Samara-like) and she seemed to enjoy all her evil doings .. Original had payback, but Carrie wasn't TRYING to be sadistic- she was just crazy and snapped.. This movie seems (to me) to be a remake that thought the special effects could carry it. (and failed) Usually love Julianne Moore, but her character wasn't believable as a nutty(!!), delusional religious freak.. I kept shaking my head during the movie as it got more and more trite. I was looking forward to watching this remake (with an open mind!) and was sorely disappointed. It may have gotten a few stars if they had cast the main characters differently, but they gave dismal performances and were a large part of my disappointment. **sad face**",Carrie
410,Tehsupercow,Great film.,10,2 December 2013,"I was curious going into this film, as I know Chloe is a great actress, and I really dislike remakes. But I was really surprised by this though, great acting all round, the script is basically the same as the first one, with some tweaks to it(It was a book first people, the script can't actually change that much). The help of CGI has made this film a lot better than the original film(I'll get hate for saying it, but there you go). Really great film, enjoyed it a hell of a lot, I would recommend it to everyone. 10*, cracking acting, brilliant portrayal of the book. A few funny scenes which make the film quite enjoyable. Julianne Moore was a great Margaret White and Chloe was a brilliant Carrie White (A lot better in my honest opinion, than Sissy Spacek). All in all, I'd advise you too watch it!",Carrie
411,stefan_haase,Better than the original and great actors,8,24 January 2014,To sum it up directly: I enjoyed this movie much more than the original. The behaviors of the characters are more comprehensible and the performances of Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore are excellent! In contrast to the original movie you really feel with Carrie until the inevitable end. Some may ask why to make such a similar remake. Simple answer: Even such classical movies like Carrie gets a little bit dusty over the decades and now you got a great movie even young people can watch (who would switch off the original after a few minutes).I am really looking forward for Chloe Grace Moretz next movies!,Carrie
412,hartyjames1,Interesting,7,14 January 2014,"Carrie 2013, This movie is very interesting, I love the cinematic experience although we do see a few flaws and that's why I subtract 1 mark.Chloe Moretz took on a huge part as lead actress and I believe she absolutely nailed it even though she is very young. Its fair to say the performances from all the actors and actresses is A1. and I award Full marks for that.It reminded me about the movie Matilda. However I have mixed reactions and opinions as regards the story, I have never read the book so i cant comment on how much it relates to the movie maybe they have tried to keep it really close. As i don't know I'm going to talk on. I feel there could be a lot more in the movie because it had SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE BETTER! for instance I would have liked to have seen Carrie as if it were surviving at the end for the simple reason she put in so much effort to cope during the story and more interaction between Carrie and Sue because Sue tried to make up with her as if for the whole movie she wants to talk and help Carrie. Although I was thinking more real justice rather than just plain revenge, I suppose revenge can be still fun OK so i just feel there could have been definitely more in this area and as a result I have deducted 2 marks.The movie is classed as a horror/drama, horror is usually scary with some gore. There has been some gore with the bloody fingers, the period and the killing for the pigs blood but gore is kept to a minimum which I like because too much gore looks unrealistic so its grand for the squeamish. Coming to the drama side all the actors and actresses they put on a brilliant performance I could definitely feel the emotion.over all I would definitely recommend this movie for one of those lazy nights of sitting in front of the fire eating popcorn and drinking a beer.",Carrie
413,PancakeConnoisseur,Way to go Carrie!,8,2 November 2013,"This remake, re imagining, or whatever the kids are calling it these days definitely hit the mark. It's hard to make a good remake, it's even harder to make a good remake of a horror movie, and it's darn near impossible to make a good remake of a horror movie classic! Whether you loved it or hated it, you got to admire the amount of guts it takes to take on such a project.This movie was not a remake of the classic film, and it is not a re imagining of the classic novel. The best way to describe this movie is if the classic and the novel had a baby, and said baby grew up in the current generation we're in. It is truer to the book than the original was, however there were a lot of noticeable scenes taken from the classic.Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of flaws. For one, the attack at the prom felt too controlled. Its been a long time since I've read the book, but to my knowledge Carrie was in an uncontrollable rage and didn't even know what was going on from the minute the pigs blood hit her to when she was washing up in the bathtub.For two, some of the scene's and dialogue seemed really forced and awkwardly trying to be identical to the original. Cringe worthy acting at times by Chris also contributed to this. Chole's acting was good. Not great. But definitely good. One thing that bothered me a little was she seemed to talk and smile a lot more than I expected. Julianne Moore's performance was really good, but I think the director lost some of the craziness and creepiness by going with no music during Carrie's final fight with her mom.One last complaint, the movie felt very rushed once the town caught fire. These are minor annoyances at best though. Overall, this is a great addition to the horror genre and will be remembered as doing it's original film and its source material justice.",Carrie
414,KasabianEmpire,Carrie is back!,10,19 October 2013,"Carrie was first written in 1974 by Stephen King and made into a film in 1976, a classic. Being a big fan of Stephen King's book and the original film, I was excited to see the take on this version. This movie is dark, gruesome, emotional, and sometimes even hilarious, all the things that made the book and original great. The movie does a great job of developing all of the characters and brining out their true personalities from the book rather than the original. Chloe is great in this role. She, in no way, does not try to copy Sissy. Chloe's acting is its own and is very emotional and complex, I found myself near crying in the movie for Chloe. Julianne's role is more realistic than Piper's role, but once again Julianne does not try to copy Piper either. Julianne is terrifying and over the top while still remaining grounded in the realism.Many scenes translate from the book into this version that were not in the original, but unfortunately two to three major scenes from the book that involve Carrie's childhood and what occurs in the third act are omitted from the film, which would have made it more cohesive and intense. But a big negative of this film is the number of homages to the original DePalma film, there is a lot of them. Certain scenes, lines, shots, actions and appearances that were in the original but not in the book make it in here. It sometimes feels more like a remake than an adaptation. And the ending, for the most part, is a tad ridiculous. But all in all, it is a great film on its own standards, I just wish Kim Pierce put more of her stamp on it rather than take DePalma's stamp. Positives: +Better character development +Added more scenes from the book +Beautiful cinematography +Emotional performances from Moretz and Moore +Great suspense and special effectsNegatives: -Omitted scenes -Too many homages to the original (feels more like a remake than adaptation). -Fast paced -Terrible ending",Carrie
415,zenstation13,Unnecessary Remake,5,20 October 2013,"This movie is hardly a scene-by-scene account of Brian De Palma brilliantly 'Carrie'. Yes, it impossible not to compare any remake to its original version, especially when the original is considered a classic. It is sad that with these days' shortage of originality, even a seemingly talented director such as Kimberly Peirce, succumbs to the commercial appeal of movie-making in the sole interest of monetary gain resulting in watered-down quality. Well, I'm not even sure if this movie will make its money back, given the mediocrity in all aspects of its quality. But then again, there are a lot of junks out there that make tons of money. All the efforts for the reimagining, whether it be an attempt to create a franchise or sequel or to modernize the narrative has totally undermined the essence of this otherwise compelling story. The destructiveness of social isolation, religious fanaticism, BULLYING, to name a few, underlined in Stephen King's novel were in no way conveyed effectively in this movie. There is a lack of connection in Moretz's performance and  she is unconvincing as a socially deprived and awkward girl. Julianna Moore as always delivers a competent performance.  But she can only carry the movie so far. As talented as Moretz is, she is a miscast for this movie.  As such, the movie is moderately entertaining at best.",Carrie
416,annette-barron,The Blasphemy of the Modern Day Carrie,1,19 January 2014,"I am not an expert writer but I just watched something so hideous that I had to write a review to get it off of my chest. I am an avid watcher of horror movies...and remakes of Stephen King novels are my favorite. Of course I've seen the original Carrie countless of times and I enjoy it every time I watch with the ending always leaving me wanting more. When I heard of yet another remake of this movie, I was excited to see it even though other remakes have been disappointing at best. Well, I have to say that this remake was the worst of them all. It appeared this remake was trying to stick to the original but with a 21st century spin with cell phones and limos. This movie missed the mark. Since the movie was a dud from the beginning I was hoping that at least the Tommy Ross character was a dreamboat like William Katt was back in the day...NOT! Ansel Elgort not incredibly gorgeous and his acting left a horrible taste in my mouth. He was not believable at all. I have to give it to Julianne Moore, she definitely gave the best performance in the movie (the best of the worst). The prom scene was just a horrible regurgitation of the original movie. To say I was disappointed is just an understatement. This movie SUCKED! $6.99 to view this movie; I want a refund. This movie is not worth your time. I actually had to watch the original to erase that blasphemy from my memory...and to see the dreamy William Katt again play the Tommy Ross I know and love.",Carrie
417,raydpowell95,Chloe Carrys the Film (pun completely intended),6,18 October 2013,"Let me just start by saying I am literally obsessed with the original novel by Stephen King. It was the book I chose to do my research paper on in high school and, therefore, I know it like the back of my hand. I could tell even from the teaser trailer that this film was going to try to be more true to the novel than the classic 1976 film, which got me very excited. However, by the end of the movie, I was pretty disappointed with quite a few things.I'll start with the positives, though. First and by far most obvious is Moretz as Ms. Carrieta White. Absolutely phenomenal job from this proved young actress. Go see this movie for her, really, she's great the whole time. She really did the best she could do with what she was given, because if just about any other young actress had played her, this movie probably would have fallen apart, for me.Other things that were good were the way they used modernization of the story to add an interesting element; the recording of the shower incident. That really helped put a few spins on the way the story unfolded and made things interesting for me, especially the when the video is shown right after the pig blood is spilled. Also, Alex Russell as Billy Nolan and Julianne Moore as Margaret White were great casting choices and Ansel Elgort delivered solidly, though not amazingly, as Tommy Ross.Now on to the negatives. I realize that movies need to not drag on for too long, but some of the scenes felt just way too choppy and the intensity of certain parts between Carrie and her mother just wasn't there, and these were some of the better scenes, mostly due to Moore and Moretz. This and many other flaws are primarily due to the script, which has one or two nice, witty lines I enjoyed, but overall, it was just bad. Both Chris and Billy were given no character development whatsoever, and that was a huge part of what made the book so amazing, getting inside all of the main characters' minds gave the story its depth. Russell gets just one line to try and convey the character development that should have took place and he delivers it with meaning and drive, which tells me that he saw the character better than the writers or director did. Wilde and Doubleday, however, were much more amateurish in their portrayals of Sue Snell and Chris Hargensen, in my opinion. Granted, they weren't given much to work with by the screenwriters, but like I said before, that didn't stop Moretz or Russell from making their characters come to life. Two other things I just have to address: One, the way the teens in the movie were made to portray bullying made me cringe. The director must be completely out of touch with how teenagers actually act in high school. There's a part where Carrie is reading a poem in front of the class and the ""cool"" kids are laughing at her because she's Carrie and she's a freak. And then she's walking down the hallway and everyone looks at her and snickers. These things would never happen, anyone who's been in high school knows what I'm getting at here. Portraying high school bullying and prejudice in the way this movie does literally reminded me of a Nickelodeon film... yeah, that unrealistic. When it's done like this, it loses it's impact. If it where done the way it would actually happen, it would hit home much better and impact the audience the way it was intended to. People in the audience laughed at parts that, from reading the book, I know were not intended to be laughed at, which is one of the worst things that can happen in a theater. The second thing is the fact that hand-picks the people she wants to kill and only kills them, then saves Mrs. Desjardin and cries over Tommy. This suggests that she is still in her mind throughout the massacre. Carrie becoming an engine of destruction completely out of her own mind who kills hundreds of people is a physical representation for what bullying and prejudice with no kindness or relief can do to a person psychologically. And since Carrie's mind is capable of telekinesis, this mental breakdown is manifested physically, causing the destruction of a small town. But by doing it the way the film did it, having her obviously be in her own mind, because she is selective about who she kills, cuts it down to just a poor girl getting revenge on the people who hurt her. The one thing that does help show Carrie's berserk, destroyed state is, once again, Moretz's beautiful acting. Now granted, all directors and screenwriters certainly have the right to there own interpretation, but this interpretation just doesn't impact us even close to as strongly as King's original telling does. Plus, the film is marketed as a horror film (as it should be, even though it's not like your average scary movie), so the ending needs to be terrifying because it's the where all the horror happens. It wasn't terrifying at all; you were happy Carrie did what she did because she just kills the high school bitches, plus Billy. If she killed half the town, like in the book, you'd both leave the theater adequately disturbed and you'd understand the moral that King was trying to communicate. Sadly, you don't really get either of these things. All in all, I still enjoyed the film because it's ""Carrie"", and I love it so. And Moretz was perfect. For me, the film is about a 6.8/10. If it weren't for Moretz, however, it would probably be closer to the 4/10 range.",Carrie
418,welshbrittney,Beautiful Remake!,8,1 January 2014,"Carrie is a heartwarming and heartbreaking story, but this version brings more of the Stephen King darkness to it. All of the modern elements added to this movie do not take away from the original story, I feel as though it helped make the movie darker. It's definitely a winner in my book and I'm currently awaiting the DVD release. Personally I was bullied quite heavily in school as Carrie was, so I've always loved the tale and this new version is just as good as the original, I love both of them! Some people say it was an unnecessary remake, but I believe it to be a remastering of the original, not a replacement. The acting in this movie is brilliant, Chloë Grace Moretz always astounds me with the darkness she can bring into her roles for such a young lady. I don't think there would have been anyone more fitting than Julianne Moore to play the mother (Margaret White) of Carrie White. The direction, acting and special effects are all amazing, overall it is a very well put together film.Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of older movies but sometimes I feel there is more to be desired (considering the advancement in special effects since they were filmed), that's when I watch a remake. Just as you love your favorite records, sometimes you just want a little quality update. I think this little quality update is pretty awesome, don't dismiss it purely based on the facts that it is a remake of a movie which was derived from a book.",Carrie

Carrie plays the roll superb, very convincing and a little scary at times. From the very first minute till the last, this movie had my attention. All credit goes to the people who made this movie. The original scenario stays intact and they added some interesting things. The original carrie played the roll very well, but the special effects weren't as spectacular. Don't look at the rating of only 6.1, this movie is a 9 worth to me. I watched this movie several times now, it is that good.

422,Lunatic_Constellations,"A modest improvement over the overrated '76 version, but not enough of one",6,19 October 2013,"Tonally, I think Peirce did a far better job capturing the mood of the source material, but she could've done so much more to really make this version stand on its own, which she, for whatever reason, just failed to do. Too many scenes just felt like de-campified (though not fully, much to the film's detriment) versions of those found in the '76 film (yes, including that godawful tux shopping scene, though it's mercifully shortened this time around). And while efforts were certainly made to modernize the setting, they really almost felt like afterthoughts in a lot of places. There was a palpable sense that this was a film hastily adapted for 2013 from material written 40 years prior. The Tim Tebow reference was particularly cringeworthy to me. Anytime you have iconic characters being played by two very different sets of actors across a 37-year temporal gulf, the comparisons become inevitable. I was personally very glad to have Piper Laurie's exorbitantly hammy Southern Preacher lady out of the equation, and thought Julianne Moore should rightfully take her place as the definitive Margaret White. Chloe Moretz had a much more difficult time getting out from under Sissy Spacek's shadow, as was to be expected. I think she did some scenes better than Spacek (the shower room scene was a standout, as was the finale), but not others. She understood her relative handicap as a much more recognizable (and, let's not tiptoe around it, attractive) face and made an admirable effort to play the character differently, really out of necessity. She acquitted herself beautifully as a naive, repressed girl trying to rebel against her mother, but Spacek understandably was much more of the true outcast. I don't think casting Moretz was a mistake. Certainly it wouldn't have been viewed as one if the 1976 film had never been made. I think even if they got someone who was a dead ringer for Sissy Spacek to play Carrie White, the comparisons would've been that much harsher on the younger actress because she would've been expected to play the character JUST LIKE Spacek, which would've meant having to match her scene-for-scene and line-for-line. Moretz will never be viewed as the definitive Carrie, but her take on the character was effective enough and unique enough to warrant her a mention when stories are written about the next film adaptation (of which I'm sure there'll be more than one, decades from now). Between the two supporting casts, I think it's a wash, frankly, which was disappointing because that was one of my biggest complaints about the '76 film. Russell was the standout, totally destroying John Travolta's entirely too playful Billy Nolan. The rest were a mixed bag. The teenagers looked a lot more like actual teenagers, but they were emotionally underwhelming. More at home on a TV melodrama than a feature-length film. The film as a whole felt like there was something always lurking in the periphery of the script and Kim Peirce's direction that just waited to sneak up on the audience and really wow us, and the source material held ample such opportunities, but unfortunately it never really emerged. The script was part of the problem, limiting the Carrie/Margaret scenes and not offering enough background for just how mentally and spiritually broken Carrie was, and also including some rather strained-sounding dialogue. But Peirce, and it pains me to say this, didn't do nearly as good a job as I expected her to do in selling the alienation angle for Carrie and Margaret alike. It's likely that one or two crucial scenes were left on the cutting room floor (for instance, 'Young Carrie' is credited but appears nowhere in the film). There were a couple of scenes I found genuinely brilliant, including the aforementioned seam ripper escapades by Margaret and the use of Chris' video of Carrie during the prom, in addition to some great use of light & shadow in the White home, but again... so many missed opportunities. One thing about this adaptation that feels like Peirce's handiwork (but also could've been Moretz/Moore working on their own) that seemed brilliant to me was the incorporation of psychosexual undertones into the Carrie and Margaret characters. Margeret's masochism was played up very well, which isn't really new, but it was handled very intelligently. But Moretz also did her part - and I feel kind of creepy talking this way about a 15-year-old girl, but it was impossible not to notice - looking like she was getting a real orgasmic thrill out of using her powers. It seemed a bit odd at first, but it made a lot of sense, given the sexual repression she'd suffered all her life, that she'd end up expressing it in other ways, the same way her mother did. This is something I feel like critics missed out on in reviewing the film, which is a shame to me because it was a great touch.The worst part about this film were the visual effects. Very cheap and fake-looking. I don't know what the film's effects budget was, or if it was just a matter of amateurish personnel, but aside from a couple of decent shots during the prom massacre, they really took me out of the film. They weren't SyFy original bad, but definitely not what should be expected out of a major studio production. To put it bluntly, I feel like both dePalma's version and Roberto Aguirre- Sacasa's script were twin albatrosses around this film's neck, dragging it dangerously close to mediocrity when it should've, by all rights, been so much more.",Carrie

I was not sure, and a bit skeptical, of how good or bad the Carrie remake would be. However, I found myself glued to the screen from the very start right up to the end. You don't want to mess with Sissy Spacek and you don't want to mess with Chloe Moretz either. Each bring their own version of Carrie to the screen and I think they are both great. Same goes for Julianne Moore. She is no Piper Laurie but she still brings the character of Carries mother to life. So if you are going to see this movie thinking it is going to be the same as the original your going to be disappointed. This Carrie brings her own game to the screen. This is my advice to you all who want to go see this movie. Watch it not comparing it to the original Carrie movie but as a brand new modern day Carrie in today's world.",Carrie
426,r-g-mirabel,Margaret & Carrie as a Convincing Abraham & Isaac Tragedy,8,17 October 2013,"Caution: This may contain spoilers.We all knew it would happen--the film would inevitably be compared to the 1976 original helmed by Brian DePalma with the estimable Sissy Spacek in the title role. A sharply divided reception was predictable. And that's a shame. The Kim Pierce iteration is one that pays homage to the original here and there, but was ultimately meant to stand on its own as an adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel. But we all knew that a remake, by simple virtue of being a remake, would elicit the position that it is completely unnecessary. Again, that's a shame. In the hands of Kim Pierce, the plot focuses on social issues that necessitate a retelling. It is evident from how the present film is handled that it is not created in the same vein as remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho, or any other project meant to turn a quick buck for a studio at the expense of originality or a younger generation's unawareness of the original. Times have changed, and the problem of bullying has evolved along with it. It is this problem that the socially-conscious Pierce sought to address.Having watched both the original and the remake with a much younger nephew, certain moments in the original, while still terrifying, were lost to him for stylistic reasons--something a viewer might call campiness. This is something the remake has remedied. I suppose what was effective in the 1970s is not as effective to a less sensitized generation of moviegoers who crave realism over theatricality. A younger audience is likely to appreciate the naturalness of Julianne Moore's acting, or relate far better to Chloe Grace Moretz's portrayal of the sheltered teen. While the target audience will surely appreciate the film, so will fans of the Stephen King novel. Many (but not all) plot elements that were woefully omitted from the 1976 film are given a rightful place in the new film, giving the story much more coherence and unity.The most striking aspect is the mother-daughter relationship. Pierce, Moretz, and Moore handle the dynamic beautifully. The love-hate-fear relationship is more fully fleshed out than in the original. Whereas Piper Laurie's portrayal of Margaret White, remarkable in its own right, is of a maniacal fundamentalist who oppresses her daughter, Juliane Moore's is of a damaged woman who has probably lived through one too many mental breakdowns. While viewers will always appreciate the theatricality of Piper Laurie, there is a certain undeniable grittiness to Moore's more psychological version of Carrie's abusive mother. Moore's Margaret is not all fire-and-brimstone, either. There are flashes where one sees profound maternal instinct and care for her daughter. Certain added scenes give Pierce the opportunity to put Margaret and Carrie in a kind of ""Abraham and Issac"" scenario which makes it difficult for the audience to completely think of Margaret White as an antagonist. Moore's Margaret is at times Carrie's enemy, and at other times her protector--an uncomfortable situation for the viewer, and Pierce pulls it off flawlessly.I had misgivings about the casting decision with Miss Moretz. She is a beautiful young lady who I feared would not portray the outcast well. This misgiving was soon forgotten, however, early as the film progressed. Sure she's a beautiful girl, but she pulled off Carrie's shy awkwardness convincingly. She is not Sissy Spacek, but she didn't try to be. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. We will always have Spacek's bloody, wide eyed visage in our minds when we think of Carrie. But while Spacek gave off creepy, Moretz's portrayal is more human and sympathetic. One might view Spacek's Carrie as robotically vengeful, whereas Moretz's telekinetic feats lead to unintended, regrettable consequences. To Moretz, the power is at times too much for the girl to handle. Overall, Moretz's Carrie is closer to the one I envision when I think about the novel. I prefer Spacek's iconic stare, admittedly, but that's not to say Moretz wasn't convincing. Rather, her portrayal was prodigious--of high caliber for an actor her age.Perhaps the greatest ""pro"" the remake has over the original is the more well-rounded secondaries: Sue, Tommy, Chris, and Billy. Fans of the book may have been bothered by Travolta's drunken greaser portrayal of Billy Nolan. At last, Alex Russell's Billy is closer to the sociopathic teen in King's book. Sue and Chris are not mere pawns in the storyline here. The acting ability of certain secondaries seems wanting at times, but the characters themselves are given a greater purpose here.Does this live up to the original? I suppose that would be a completely subjective assessment. Both films have pros and cons. Taken on its own, however, the film is not a great one, but it's strong. It flows naturally. It is deeply psychological, not just for Carrie and Margaret, but for the other characters, too. Ultimately, it was worthwhile, and I don't doubt it will be memorable to its target audience as the 1976 film is for older viewers.There are some more concerns, however. It is clear that some scenes were filmed and left out. Like the original, bits and pieces of the deleted scenes found their way into various places in the plot. It makes me wonder whether Pierce envisioned the film to be even closer to the novel, as stated in early interviews. Note that Judy Greer stated in a more recent interview that upon seeing the finished product, from the beginning it did not follow the shooting script. Apparently there were huge and significant alterations made in the studio during the release date delay. Such is a common practice for a studio or test audience to trim excellent, essential scenes out of a film for brevity. Here's to hoping for a Director's Cut for the home release honoring Pierce's original vision. Perhaps my rating will be even higher then.",Carrie

429,jonkingson4,The best remake of Carrie possible...a must see film,10,24 October 2013,"A re-imagining of the girl with telekinetic powers who unleashes terror on her tormentors after being pushed to far at her senior prom! Chloe Grace Moretz takes on the role immortalized by Sissy Spacek in the 1976 classic. Although the film is more of a remake than a re-imagining, it still has enough excitement and creativity to go down in history as the best remake of Carrie possible! Julianne Moore is perfect as Margret White (Carrie's mother) and brings to the screen a new level of crazy that must be seen to be believed. Judy Greer is hilarious as the sarcastic yet calm gym teacher who attempts to help Carrie. Chloe Grace Moretz is the perfect modern day Carrie as she represents modern girls who simply want to fit in, and Portia Doubleday is very convincing as a modern Chris who uses technology to torment Carrie. While the original focuses more on the horror aspect of Carrie, this version is more tragic as it gives a more realistic tone to the bullying story and while Sissy Spacek was truly amazing as Carrie in the original, Chloe is more ""relatable"" for modern day girls. Although this film hardly comes close to the masterpiece that was the original, Carrie 2013 is a film that must be seen. Unlike other remakes which are more gory, cheesy shot for shot films, this Carrie gives high respect and honor to the original and keeps the spirit of the original alive while still adding its own take to the story. There is no doubt that if the classic had not excited, THIS Carrie would be the classic. But since the original does exist and is totally awesome, this will have to settle for second place behind the original, however, that spot is well earned. In a sane world, this film would never had been made but I'm happy to say I'm glad it was! 8/10, well acted and well told.",Carrie
430,danthompson99,Worthwhile horror stabs,8,14 February 2015,"I was never a fan of the original, or indeed much of Stephen King's work on the big screen. This 20th century re-imagining, complete with cyber-bullying, brings a fresh look to the vaunted telekinesis and psychic movies that seemed so prevalent back in the 80's. (Reboot Scanners please !) Chloe Grace brings to bat a solid performance here as the troubled, and bullied teen. As a bullying survivor myself I felt that she portrayed the futility and fear of high school powerfully. It's a fabulous performance, only upstaged by Julianne Moore's brutal and over the top portrayal of Carrie's zealot mother. It's a great story, well played and the final act makes full use of the effects of today to bring the carnage hurtling out of the screen at you. From a horror fan, I thought this was top draw, and I look forwards to seeing much more from young Ms Moretz in years to come. Also fans should check out the youtube prank where they pretended a telekinetic went berserk in a coffee shop is genius !",Carrie
431,nilealric,It's a remake to Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. I liked the film but I don't love it.,5,7 November 2013,"When Brian De Palma recycled one of Stephen King's masterpiece into a motion picture, the 1976 film titled ""Carrie"" became master manipulator when it comes to the supernatural horror/thriller genre. Imagine a teenage girl, socially isolated from the world due to her mother's religious fanaticism, discovers that she has a telekinetic powers. Well, this is one girl who will not be underestimated. And combined with De Palma's atrocious and heart-rending takes on King's best-selling novel, Carrie was one of those film that made us want to leave because it's terrifying but also glued us to our seat and made us enjoy every second of it. These past few years we have seen many classics being remade, but the world had no great need of a remake of De Palma's film, although viewing Kimberly Peirce's 2013 version of the film is something you can gave a chance to squeeze on your busy schedule for it leads us to a different route of the cult classic. This can be initially seen in the film's opening as it started with Maragaret White (Moore), a religious fanatic, giving a bloody birth to Carrie. Her version also downplayed the voyeuristic predilection of the earlier film and gave it a modern twist specially on the shower scene humiliation part where, aside from the throwing tampons and others diabolically laughing at Carrie (Moretz), it added the use of smart phones and the presence of the Internet which can make any teenager be a center of ridicule and mediocrity for all eternity. One thing I can point out best with Peirce's version of Carrie, is that it is made of an ensemble cast whose acting are strong, especially Moore and Moretz who stood to the occasion with their seamless performances. And although it did not match Laurie Piper and Sissy Spacek's Academy- worthy performances that made them iconic, the on screen mother-daughter chemistry of both Moore and Moretz is more naturalistic than their predecessors. Both held it on their own and their acting was like ""country-fying a pop anthem"". While Peirce's version boasts it talented cast, the film is nowhere near the original. Nonetheless, it is as good as a remake can get. It was not delivered as the scary movie that gave us the thrill. It made us view Carrie not as the girl who scares the heck out of us with her I-want-to- kill-you-because-everyone-is-laughing-at-me look and telekinetic power but a desperate heroine who suddenly starts killing everyone and eventually herself. And as to the prom scene, I can't help but compare and contrast the original and the revamp. The latter can be praised a little with its bizarrely overwhelming effects (thanks to the power of technology) but it fell short of De Palma's split screen prom finale scene which critics considered as a tour de force. We cannot deny the fact that the remake fell short of that Carrie legacy – a timeless piece of motion picture that brought scary to the next level - as Peirce's ""reimagining"" of King's novel was a little bit lazy mostly due to Peirce's shortcomings as a filmmaker. Although universally lauded by critics for her 2008 film ""Stop-Loss"" (which I admire), Peirce did not connect with the new Carrie film. The film exposed Peirce to her major weaknesses. She took a sycophantic approach with the film but failed to make a real impact. I admire her as a good director of actors but she isn't as brilliant as a filmmaker. Although things written above were nothing but to criticize the film and describe its inferiority to the original one with a little bit of praise to its cast, the new Carrie managed to preserve its commercial value as a film for the sake of moviegoers' source of entertainment. Peirce's effort is commendable in such a way that she managed to create a better remake of a classic film. With that being said, the Carrie remake may not be as good as the original nor it has lived up to King's written masterpiece, it has helped prove that a tale about an awkward teenage girl with telekinesis will continue to be a modern-day classic.",Carrie
432,little_miss_murder-864-947508,Triggering,8,7 December 2013,"From someone who has watched both films i found this re-make interesting. The main issue i had was with making Carrie's mother, Julianne Moore, a self harmer. I warn anybody who has mental health issues or self harm issues to watch cautiously as it could be a trigger. Throughout the movie to illustrate Carrie's mothers deranged state, they make her scratch, cut, and bang her head against things. I see why they thought this would add to the character, but it seemed unnecessary.Other then that the film was OK, i don't think Chloe Moretz was the best choice for Carrie, because the book describes Carrie as Holmley, easy to understand why she was picked on/ignored or nothing special, Chloe seems too obviously attractive. That being said her acting was good",Carrie
433,joshieboy678,It was enjoyable!,6,10 January 2014,"I enjoyed this film. I loved Chloe's interpretation, she did great! IMO, I think that the director could have done better with the ""More faithful to the book"" idea though. I mean 2 major important scenes were in either deleted or extended scenes, that I would have loved to seen. That basically just ruined that for me. Anyways, like I said it was good. One of my personal favorites was a minor character. Her character name was ""Heather."" I have no clue why, I just love her character. For me Julianne was great and spine chilling (Especially with that seam ripper O.o) but she wasn't AS creepy as Piper Laurie. I loved Chris way better in this version. I mean don't get me wrong I LOVE Nancy Allen but she had a sweet touch to her, and was just basically a blonde wanna-be *Beep* who just wants to be well..a *Beep*. However, I am tied with Sissy and Chloe. This IMO doesn't beat the original, but it is a very well written adaption/remake. For me, I think that Sissy had that great awkward and depressed look. Chloe had it too, but not as much as being an ""outcast."" She just seemed like she wanted to fit in along with everyone. They both get a 10/10.Prom Scenes: I LOVE the original prom scene. That scary look that Sissy gives made me wet myself (Joking). She did really good with the MASSIVE eye-effect. I loved the fire hoses too. I KIND of felt bad for the bullies, but I kind of cheered for Carrie like some lunatic. Now the 2013 version had a phenomenal prom scene. It was great CG effects and everything. I loved Tina's death the most. So horrifying getting whipped by wires and then caught on fire.I mean the girl had a heart condition. For me those proms get 9/10 (For original) and 8/10 (For adaption/remake).Effects: I loved the effects in both films, of course I cannot judge the 1976 one on this. I mean those were the effects for that time. IMO, I think the 1976 version had better effects than the 2002 one. It was BEFORE the 2002 remake, I mean COME ON, and they had better effects. Especially with the fire hoses, that was better than the cheesy prom in the 2002. Anyways, I liked the 2013 effects, except the flying moon. It looked too corny. I also HATED the choke hold scene. I am glad Carrie saved Miss Desjardin (Like the book) but I hate how Judy Greer isn't even touching her throat until she is in the air. So for the effects 7/10 (Original) and 8/10 (Adaption/Remake)Ratings for both films...Original 9/10Newer Adaption/Remake, 7/10.Overall, this was a pretty good remake and it is like-able to watch. Of course the original will always be an original, but this by far is very faithful to the book and you should go see it some time :)",Carrie
434,idazombie,Cult Classic for the next generation of horror fans,10,27 December 2013,"Review of the remake of 1976 horror cult classic movie ""Carrie"" Released in theatres October 18, 2013 Release on DVD due on January 14, 2014 I am a fan of the original but was very impressed with the smooth melding of the updating this fan favorite so another generation could be explore the twisted mind of Stephen King. I felt this remake resonate as strongly as the original, and will also reach cult classic status for true horror fans, new and old alike. It was super bold to have such a talented actress as Julie Ann Moore in the mother role, she was really into the character and you could believe every moment she was on screen. Judy Greer was also a super choice for gym coach, she was believable, likable, and realistic in her portrayal of the character. In the original the it seemed as if the coach was more of a B and so were several more of the girls. This story seems even more relevant now with how extreme bully situations can get in schools. A noteworthy update was faculty members attempting to control and or rectify a situation that could have resulted in dire consequences. Even with the updates in story line, technology, and special effects the true grit and carnage of the original played out it even more glorious detail while still staying true to the original that has haunted enticed, and stayed a favorite of horror fans for over 37 years. The acting, updates, and special effects help this classic adapt to another generation of horror fans making this movie a classic of a classic.

435,fadytouma199777,Magical horror movie,8,2 January 2014,"CARRIE is a magical horror movie, not only it contains most of the scary things a good horror movie needs but it also spices it up with some moral. In fact, it shows what does bullying lead to. There isn't a lot of nudity which is rare these days so I recommend you to watch this beast. The whole movie is not THAT scary but it contains a lot of disturbing bloody scenes and cruel killing ways, that won't make you uncomfortable if you're a true horror/thriller fan. The script is written well enough. The directors did a good job. It could be so easy to make a "" CARRIE TWO "" because of the magical ending of the movie. I gave the film 8/10 because it wasn't too scary and I never give more than 9/10 so 8/10 in considered very good! Now go and watch it.",Carrie
436,pinkninjaz666,Carrie's newest incarnation is a Bloody Masterpiece...,8,5 January 2014,"Well... I just finished watching the 2013 remake of Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's ""Carrie"" (Wow, that's a mouthful). What's the verdict? It is perhaps one of the best films I've seen all year, despite the generally terrible reviews it has received from nearly every ""critic"" out there. Chloe Grace Moretz masterfully conveys the emotions expressed by Carrie in the novel, as well as the physical burdens of using her telekinetic abilities, and the supporting cast of teenagers never fall victim to ""Millennial Syndrome"". Instead, they all exhibit a surprising amount of maturity despite being actual teenage actors, rather than twenty-five-year-olds pretending to be seventeen. Where other high school dramas are injected with meta-speak and pop- culture, this film takes a much more down-to-earth approach in letting the story shine instead of the special effects, or soundtrack. Even more refreshing is the inclusion of several omitted sections from the novel, which are re-introduced (Albeit not as grand in scale, and often spliced into scenes lifted from the 1976 film). You won't see Carrie unscrewing fire-hydrants, or people playing hop-scotch over downed power lines, but there is enough of the extended carnage to please fans of the source material that inspired both films (and the t.v. mini-series). This movie strives to be a crowd pleaser, while keeping die-hard fans happy and succeeds on both counts. It's almost as if they adapted it straight from the pages of the book, but remembered to keep iconic scenes such as the final prank wholly intact. If there is anything negative to be said, it would be that it's perhaps a little TOO close to the original film (I was able to quote most of the dialogue before it was delivered. Like I said, I LOVE the original Carrie, as well as the novel). Julianne Moore deserves several nods for her creepily effective take on the character of Margaret White, stabbing, hitting, and scratching herself as a form of penance for her sins, and Judy Greer shines as the sympathetic gym teacher Ms. Desjardin (Which is what the character is named in the book). Ultimately, I feel that once the negativity surrounding this movie dies down (and all those half-rate, make a quick buck, amateurish film critics move on to praise the latest brainless blockbuster), 2013's Carrie may be recognized as being superior to the original (Which will always have a special place in my heart). You may also be interested to know that the director of this film is actually friends with De Palma, and was reluctant to do a remake in the first place (As was Moretz, and the producer). After reading the script, they all quickly changed their minds... And I couldn't be happier with the result (Unless of course they made a RELIGIOUS adaptation of the novel wherein it was told in retrospect, included the rain of stones as a flashback to when Carrie was a little girl, made Margaret White large and intimidating, finally showed Carrie leveling the ENTIRE town and killing her mom with a heart attack, illustrated the psychic connection between Carrie and Sue, AND cranked up the intensity of the abuse Carrie endures.) I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is wary of remakes, or is a fan of Carrie in general. (And if you don't believe me, watch it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.)",Carrie
437,onenamja,Give it a shot and watch it at night!!,8,18 January 2014,"The story is a bit slow at some points. Then again, maybe it was because I knew what was going to happen due to seeing the original so I kind of was in anticipation mode. However, because they modernize it; it easier to get into. If they did it in the same era (80s) as the original it would have been a bit cheesy. So again with them making it to our current date adds more details to the story. Anyhow, I think the kills are better than the original. Key words to remember without spoiling it for you... Carrie is like a combination of Professor X and Darth Vader. They go all out with creativity. Last but not least, the mother(Julianne Moore) plays it to the T. Talk about being the scariest character in the movie. Watch it!!",Carrie
438,goonyman1968,Girl suppressed by crazy religious mother hides deep dark powers,3,19 January 2014,"In my opinion this film is a very poor remake of what is a brilliant film by Stephen King it should of been left alone. Some films just should not be remade to make more money. Even with the special effects in this film it still falls behind the original . Just because there are special effects artists out there it don't mean to say the film is made any better by them in some cases like this film I think it just hides the shoddy acting.Sissy Spacek Was brilliant in the original i think if she saw the remake she would laugh .I think Chloë Grace Moretz really does not fulfill the roll of Carrie in this film like Sissy Spacek. Sissy Specek scared the hell out of me in the original,Chloë Grace Moretz just didn't cut it for me in this movie she was to Unbelievable as Carrie I hope she does better in future.

439,arrafidurgam,Great AMAZING Remake!!!!,10,27 January 2014,"This movie was an amazing movie played by Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore. Starting off, don't compare this to a classic. It's a movie directed by a different director with different thoughts. Also, the actors have their different styles of acting.Chloe is an amazing actress in this movie. In this movie she plays as the girl Carrie White. You can see how her life has been bad from the start.Julianne is also an amazing actress. In this movie she plays as the insane Margaret White. You find her very creepy and you will want to thank God your mother is no where close like that.In the movie Carrie is bullied by almost the entire school, and her mother is a crazy psychotic religious woman who is overprotective of her daughter and wants to keep her safe.The way the movie is set up, is a perfect way to portray Carrie's life. From her origins, all the way to when she dies.Throughout the movie, you develop an emotion for all the characters in the movie. You will feel sad about how horrible Carrie White's life was. You can feel the pain Carrie went through. You will hate the girl who caused all of the bad stuff to happen to Carrie. That girl is Chris Hargensen (Portia Doubleday). You will hate her guts and will be excited at the moment when Carrie kills her. That is why this movie was AMAZING! You develop emotions during the WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE.The scary parts though, were not as scary as I expected it to be. Not a lot of violence, but a lot of blood. There is only one VERY DISTURBING SCENE. That is the most violent scene in the movie. Other parts aren't scary. Ages 13 and up should watch this movie, if they are not too scared of minor violence and one very disturbing scene. There isn't a lot of cussing and there's no nudity.The only part that wasn't too bad was the CGI. They used a lot of that in the prom scene, but it was the COOLEST SCENE in my opinion. It wasn't bad at all. It was all perfectly set up.Overall: Watch the movie. I highly recommend it. If you love the original you will also love this movie too but will have trouble comparing it to the original because you love it sooooo much. Just don't compare it. And also, this movie is part of the new generation. It shows recent everything in the whole movie. If you like the old one, you will most definitely complain about this new one. But you don't understand the point of this movie. If you don't remake Carrie, the new generation will not know about it at all. Let me ask you a question. How many young people will watch 1976 Carrie? That movie is so old, only old folks will remember it. It's better to show the new, recent version so younger people will actually understand the whole movie. So you people who love the original and hate this new one, think about that question. How many young people will watch the 1976 Carrie? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AMAZING FANTASTIC MOVIE! YOU WILL LOVE IT!",Carrie
440,heather2000-908-468315,This movie is wonderful,10,10 April 2017,"My favorite movie is Horror movie 'Carrie', which is about an outsider girl named Carrie with supernatural power. I like this movie because of these three reasons. First, the story and idea was amazing. I'd never seen this kind of story before. Fantasy, Romance and Horror's collaboration was thrilling. Second, the special effects were wonderful. Car explosion and blood pouring by Carrie's power was exciting. Last, I could empathize with Carrie's mind that she wants to escape from her mother. Her mother was psycho who believes God very strongly. She always locked Carrie up to make her pray and ask for a forgive to God. For these reasons, I like this movie very much. But I don't want to recommend this movie to week heart. Because, it is so scary that they could black out. If you get a chance to watch this movie, I want to remind you to prepare your heart.",Carrie
441,jacobzondag,Either you have seen the original or you haven't,5,4 February 2014,I suppose there are two categories of people evaluating this movie. Those who have seen the first movie (and perhaps read the great book) and the have nots. Most members of the first group are prejudiced because it already knows into detail what this is all about. So it is hard to meet their expectations of thrill and originality. The other group has the 'this is really out of the box'-feeling because they are not insiders. I have very few criteria to judge a movie: 1) Does it entertain me? 2) Is it a good idea wrapped a good story? 3) Do the actors convince me? 4) Is it visual art? Since I am a member of the first group I can't say that i was very much entertained because the new movie is practically a carbon of the first. I can't say the idea or story are any good because they have no originality in them. But the actors were actually very recognizable and that I did like. And finally I saw very little camera craftsmanship or true visual magic I so dearly love. I must add that the first one didn't have any of that either. Had I been a first timer I would have rated it higher.,Carrie
442,tomsamotyj,Unfortunately a predictable disappointment,4,6 February 2014,"Having watched the original in the late 90's at the age of 15 and being quite content, I was somewhat intrigued when I heard about this remake as to how developments in cinematography could improve this already classic of the horror genre. Whilst viewing the trailer at my local theatre I was left wondering why anybody would watch this as there is little need. Do not worry about seeing any spoilers in this review as the entire film is simply depicted in the trailer. Practically the same as the original viewed in high definition with the introduction of a few small advances in technology eg mobile phones and the internet. Probably the only improvement in my opinion is the performance of Chloe Moretz which is absolutely flawless as she portrays Carrie to another level of believability than the original. However the makers of this movie have let Moretz down with this adaptation. Yes I am crying for the makers of the movie to put their own spin on this adaptation but it seems to me as if they are trying too hard. They really do make a schoolboy error at the end. in my opinion if it ain't broke don't fix it and to me makes a mockery of the films legacy. For lovers of the horror genre that have not seen the original or a lover of Chloe Moretz's work then I would advise you to give this film a go because lets face it that good horror films are far and few between and we have all seen some real stinkers. However those of you like me that were looking for an improvement or at least an equal to the original I would not bother unless you are seeking reassurance and proof that the classics should remain untouched.",Carrie
443,joe-gilmore-81,Pretty good remake,9,17 February 2014,"No spoilers if you know the storyline already. I really enjoyed this film. The story is a good enough plot to warrant multiple remakes of it. I had no problem sitting through this one. I was engaged during the entire movie. I connected with poor Carrie and was rooting for her self-appointed justice at the end. I've never read the book itself, but I've seen most, if not all of the Carrie movies. If this was your first time ever being introduced to this plot, you would love the movie. If you've seen one of the movies before or read the book before, this is just revisiting a good story with modern settings. By the end of this movie, I was mad at some of the characters and empathized for others. I knew the plot going into the movie yet I still became fully engaged with it. Since all the Carrie movies are based on the same book, there will be similarities. But the differences are played out in the acting and setting and made this a very enjoyable movie. I recommend you watch this one.",Carrie

People that I know admire Chloe Grace Moretz massively and it's a shame that they have to see this filth.The film is not interesting, nor scary, nor entertaining, Can someone pay me my £6.80 back please?

445,gamayun-995-711144,Different but powerful,7,8 May 2014,"Although the main story is the same, this movie has a very different take on Carrie, but is that not the reason remakes exist? The 1976 version is obviously the superior horror movie, while this movie focuses more on the human/emotional aspect. In the 1976 version Carrie snaps and becomes a monster, although the viewer (or at least I) can understand Carries reasons, we are relieved that she dies. The remake also shows her snap and kill but then shows us how she suffers and regrets and even saves Sues life. Till the very end she is a victim and the viewer is left sad at her death.This is the reason why I dislike the ending scene. Which seems just to exist as an extra scare or probably as a nod to the original but does not fit into the new Carrie concept. I liked to see Sue visit Carrie's grave, showing that although the world views Carrie as a monster Sue has seen that Carrie was just a scared and hurt girl. But than they contradict that message with the ""bloody Carrie hand""-nightmare, that fit the original, since Carrie ended as a monster, but does not fit the new sympathetic Carrie.The bullies in this version seem a bit more three dimensional and less ""just bullies"". Also Carrie's mother although still crazy shows more love for her daughter (alothough in a twisted way).Lastly a word to Chloe as Carrie. I was very worried about her playing Carrie, not for her acting talent, but rather because the original Carrie looked every bit the awkward outsider while Chloe looks beautiful. But she acted sufficiently awkward and strange to fit the role. Even pretty people will get bullied when they are weird.So all in all, the movie is not without flaws, but sufficiently different to warrant the remake. The message of the new Carrie movie may be even more powerful since the protagonist stays ""human"" till the end.",Carrie
446,LauraBianchi1980,Good movie not exactly as good as the old one,7,14 August 2014,"A very good movie but it doesn't have the same appeal of the old one. Great acting of Julianne moore, who's actually making the movie worth watching.The plot is pretty the same as it was in the '79 movie. New movie techniques make de final part a bit more bloody and realistic, which is normal if we think that the original film was made more than 30 years ago. Even like that, we see a new version of Carrie which is more human, which probably is a point against the 2013 movie.In the end is a good movie, but we need to remember that remaking a film that was already working as it was it's a very difficult task. Keeping this in mind we can say that this one is well done with good actors.For more reviews check here http://www.clasf.it",Carrie
447,mbox192,"Would have been an 8, were it not for the second half",8,27 July 2016,"Let me start by mentioning that the first half of this movie itself is enough to justify watching it. Brilliant and gripping. However , the latter half made me feel like an entirely new film crew stepped in and messed things up to the point that by the time the movie is over , you'd be thinking of this downfall in the movie-making rather than reflecting on the story itself. Budget / time restraints ? If the second half had been equally as good as the first , this movie would have gotten at least an 8/10 . Julianne Moore as usual was outstanding . She perhaps played the most important character in the movie . Her pulling off of this terribly oppressed mother character looked so easy on screen . In fact I felt that she was the ONLY person who did not transform into a total amateur in the second half. All in all though , the message this movie conveys is solid if you let go of the shortcomings.",Carrie

449,suez-36109,Bad remake,1,9 May 2015,"The girl who played Carrie did a poor job in this film. I found her lacking in her ability to portray emotion. It seemed more like a Disney channel interpretation of this classic horror film. Corny tropes and bad acting. Campy is fine so long as it is still well acted. That was not the case in this film. There was nothing particularly interesting about the changes made to the film's original premise. Sad state of affairs when a remake falls so glaringly short of the original. In The original you can feel the rage and sorrow in Carrie's face, in this version you just get weird empty faces from Moretz. Her performance left a lot to be desired IMO. I actually laughed out loud during the Prom scene.",Carrie
450,carlosparsons,"Saw it twice, loved it both times.",10,13 September 2015,"Honestly, I was skeptical about this movie at first. Most horror films have horrible ratings and for a good reason. They are either cheesy, horrible acting, or the plot is slow or even confusing. This movie was none of that. When I saw that it had 4-5 stars (I can't remember because I gave it a 5 star myself so now it's only my rating that shows) on Netflix, I thought, ""Hey, what the heck, I'll give it a try."" It had wonderful acting, the actors/actresses worked well with their roles. I would see this again as well. Now, I must admit the fact that there were cute girls in here could of brought my rating higher, but it's the acting that really made the movie. I hate movies that have horrible acting and terrible fright sequences. Spoiler alert: When Carrie's mother at the beginning was about to stab the baby, I was like, ""No! No, please don't let the movie start out this way!"" (I also started thinking this when she started pulling her gown up) but thank goodness there is no nudity. It gets close, but not bad. They do a good job at covering the bad parts like (Another spoiler alert): when Carrie was in the girls locker room, and she didn't know she was getting her period. The whole time I was thinking ""Please don't show nudity"" in my head, and it came true. I'm sorry that this is a long and pointless review, but I hope that in this clutter of words you will find the point of it all. Like watch this movie because it is awesome!",Carrie

I was looking for that same intensity as with the 1976 version and I didn't get that. The mother was a religious fanatic that was torn between the love of her daughter and her religion, Julianne Moore was way too ""lovey"" in my opinion, she should've been more tougher, rougher. The weird things Chloe did with her hands was awkward, and I could've done without that. I would've liked to have seen her a bit more naive...she seemed to know a lot for someone who supposedly didn't know much.

As far as the original book goes, the original Carrie was fat and had bad acne. The original film turned her into a plain duckling, who became beautiful with acceptance. This one turns her into a beauty swaddled in religious plainness. The story is largely unchanged, except that Mom is less than Piper Laurie, the witness who was white is now black, and the baseball cap has disappeared.The whole of this film is an interview by the police, with flashbacks. That's a hard row to hoe, and I think it doesn't succeed. Rash-o-Mon it ain't. Credit those who tried to make it a bit surreal with tinkling background music, vaguely recalling Glass Menagerie, but it doesn't work.Bottom line? Viennese waltzes at a HS prom? Not likely. Fireballs plummeting into a small town in Maine not newsworthy? Not likely. One bucket of pig blood taking 10 seconds to empty? Not likely.The whole thing is ... shallow.",Carrie

The acting is terrible, the chemistry between the characters isn't believable, and the special effects are overdone. The more you watch the movie the more it becomes apparent that the actors in the 2013 knock off are not even trying to make the characters their own. I saw an interview with the director in which she says that she is wanting to make this movie closer to the book and that it is not an rip off of the original, well... she is a liar. You watch this movie and you will see that it is as if they watch the original Carrie the night before, arrived on set the next day, and tried to mimic the actors in the original -- and they failed.",Carrie
454,adamiraki-45080,Disappointing,5,5 September 2019,"I heard that there were a lot of scenes cut out of the film, such as more scenes with other characters (hence why there's a lot of extras in the casting list) along with having a few alternative endings. I also heard that the script had to be re written, which isn't unusual in this show business, however it was apparently similar to the book and Instead the final cut turned into a copy and passed version of the original.",Carrie
455,Tinleia,Great Psychological Drama,6,29 June 2018,"This movie wasn't a masterpiece, but it wasn't bad. I don't like it as a horror. It's not a very scary one, and the 'scary' parts were mostly gore and I didn't find it scary at all. I must say that the drama part was really good. You could feel sorry for the character and expirience the pain she did a little bit. It was also good as a psychological story. The movie shows us manny trials of a teen girl's life in an unusual and dark way. As she begins to take part in scenarios she was kept away from her whole life changes a lot. She was never dumb and crazy, but she seemed to be because of her mother being abusive and crazy. As she discovers life and that she can be happy and is strong she starts acting like she always wanted to and she does well. When it's all taken away from her in a short time after she finally gets it she becomes crazy and just breaks. It's not the best horror and nothing out of ordinary, but it shows us in a really fresh and extrem way a really harsh reality of teenagers. Sorry for my english. I'm not a native speaker.",Carrie

457,jackvonblood,Watch the '67 version instead of this trash,2,27 May 2020,"Actors overdo it in certain areas, underdo it in others, and just in general is a poor excuse for a remake. Script is a complete and utter joke. Could've been done MUCH better if it didn't have the main character flailing her arms around when she's doing her special thing.
Overall, it's a low effort Hollywood remake, and I can't get those 2 hours of my life back cause of this trash.
2/10 for being slightly more satisfying to watch the last half-hour than the '67 version regarding the revenge in certain aspects.",Carrie
