0,TheLittleSongbird,Through the blood-stained looking glass,7,30 December 2017,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still to me one of the scariest and best horror films there is, as well as a truly great film in its own right and introduced us to one of the genre's most iconic villains in Freddy Krueger. It is always difficult to do a sequel that lives up to a film as good as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' let alone one to be on the same level.While the best of the sequels from personal opinion is the third, the fourth one is another one of the series' better sequels. Like the third film it is not on the same level as the original, a very difficult feat, but it does have enough of what is a large appeal of the original and why it works so well. Not perfect, but a lot of very good things. 'The Dream Master' is not without its flaws. With a couple of exceptions, the acting is largely wooden (while not the worst offender as such, Tuesday Knight is no Patricia Arquette) and the beginning rock song is really cheesy and feels out of place. The story at times gets a little silly.However, Lisa Wilcox is a winning lead and Robert Englund continues to terrify as the iconic character that epitomises ""what nightmares are made of"". 'The Dream Master' is to me the second best directed sequel, courtesy of Renny Harlin, giving a potentially clichéd premise freshness and imagination.Special effects are neatly executed. The humour is darkly comic and very funny and there are some wickedly cracking one-liners. The scares are aplenty and they are legitimately creepy with some cool deaths (the water bed one is a strong example) and amazing dream sequences thrown into the mix. Alice being flung into the on-screen action from the cinema balcony is one of the series' most marvellous highlights. It's a beautifully photographed film, particularly the dream sequences, and is the most unique-looking 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' sequel with its European art-horror visual style. The production design is both dream-like and nightmare while the music is suitably haunting.Overall, good sequel and one of the series' better ones. 7/10 Bethany Cox",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
1,Leofwine_draca,Special effects extravaganza,5,22 June 2012,"The third sequel in the long-running series is set firmly in the world of the late 1980s: we're talking lame fashions, big hair, rubbery special effects and a rather uneven tone veering midway between comedy and horror. It's all about what's over the top, with everybody involved aiming to outdo the scares and FX of the previous movies, but in the end none of this can disguise the fact that by this stage the story was wearing very thin. This is nothing more than a supernatural slasher that virtually reprises the plot of the first three films in the series with different characters.Of course, watching Robert Englund hamming it up will always be a guilty pleasure, and I have to say that the special effects are also pretty impressive. In the days before CGI, the FX team here went all out in creating bizarre and inventive death scenes, most notably a moment involving a giant cockroach. Freddy's resurrection at the outset is gratuitously silly yet somehow still works, paying homage to the old Chris Lee/Dracula resurrections in spectacular fashion. There are lots of able technicians working hard behind the scenes, including Howard Berger and Screaming Mad George, and in a film this reliant on special effects their diligence pays off.It's hard to review this title objectively, because watching it makes me nostalgic for '80s cinema in all its tacky badness. But I think it's fair to say that this is one of the better sequels out there; it's not frightening in the least, but it is entertaining and it's one of few enjoyable Renny Harlin-directed movies in existence, along with DIE HARD 2 and DEEP BLUE SEA.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
2,SnoopyStyle,Love the cockroach kill but not much else,5,10 September 2014,"Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight) has the ability to pull others into her dreams and is convinced that Freddy Krueger is still out there. Joey Crusel (Rodney Eastman) and Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) are just as sure that he's gone forever. Then Kincaid falls asleep into a junkyard where his dog pees fire opening the ground and Krueger rises from oblivion. Soon the three survivors are dead and their friends led by flustered Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) are hunted down one by one.This one doesn't have Heather Langenkamp. Patricia Arquette doesn't even return for her role. The three returning survivors are killed off quickly. It is a lost for the franchise to not have a franchise protagonist. At least, Robert Englund is back. It's a hit and miss of weird killings. I really love the cockroach kill but not much else.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
3,claudio_carvalho,Freddy Krueger Is Back,5,30 March 2009,"Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight), Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) and Joey Crusel (Rodney Eastman) are having normal lives and studying in Springwood, Ohio, after defeating the evil Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Kristen is very close to her boyfriend Rick Johnson (Andras Jones) and his sister Alice (Lisa Wilcox) is her best friend. Kristen has a premonition with Freddy Krueger, who has resurrected and is chasing the trio of survivors of the Elm Street. When Freddy kills the three survivors, Kristen transfers her ability to draw other people to her dreams to Alice, and Freddy uses the power of the teenager to gather the souls of her school friends.""A Nightmare on Elm Street art 4: The Dream Master"" is a weak sequel to the classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Patricia Arquette, who performed Kristen Parker in the previous ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"", was pregnant and not able to film this sequel. The actress and musician Tuesday Knight that replaced Patricia Arquette recorded the song ""Nightmare"" used during the film's opening credits.

4,lee_eisenberg,in dreams or out of them,10,12 March 2006,"The 10/10 rating of course applies only to those who've decided that they like the movie before they watch it (others will find it totally tasteless). This one has Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) using some girl's dreams to attack people while they're still awake. Yeah, how far out can they get? If you've seen #5, then you know that they took it one step further. I guess that no matter what happens, Freddy's just never gonna go away; in 2003, he even got to duke it out with Jason. But anyway, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" is really nothing that you haven't seen before - or at least nothing that you wouldn't expect.I, for one, would like to see a movie in which all the bad guys and all the good guys from all movies have a big battle royale.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
5,jboothmillard,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,5,10 June 2013,"The first film was great, the second film was rubbish, the third film was good, I saw the critics gave this fourth film a relatively good review, and I was looking forward to seeing the iconic villain in the next sequel, from director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Deep Blue Sea). Basically the story continues from the previous film, where the bones of Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) were buried, and ""dream warriors"" Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight), Joey Crusel (Rodney Eastman) and Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) have been released from the Westin Hills Asylum and are living normal lives and attending high school. Kristen has made new friends with frequent daydreamer Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), brainy and black Sheila Kopecky (Toy Newkirk) who suffers asthma and bug hating tall girl Debbie Stevens (Brooke Theiss), as well as martial arts enthusiast boyfriend Rick Johnson (Andras Jones). It is Kincaid's dog who entering his dream innocently digs around the junk yard where Freddy's bones were buried, and he unearths them, resurrecting the killer, who kills Kincaid, and in his dream and drowned in his water bed Joey is also killed. Knowing that Freddy is back from the dead to haunt their nightmares, Kristen warns them to try and stay awake so that they will not be killed, but also she tells them of her gift to enter the dreams of others and also control the surroundings of a dream, i.e. make it a good dream rather than bad. She however does not avoid falling asleep herself and Freddy manages to creep his way into a nightmare and she is killed, so Alice is the one trying to pull everyone together and stop them from falling victim to the psycho with the razor hands, but of course they cannot control their sleeping habits, including under sedation. Alice however does research dream stuff, and comes across a nursery rhyme entitled ""The Dream Master"" and uses it to her advantage, she gets Freddy is a room of mirrors so he can see his evil reflection, this makes the souls he collected turn against him and leave his body, and he evaporates, but of course the nightmares may not be over on Elm Street. Also starring Danny Hassle as Dan Jordan, Brooke Bundy as Elaine Parker, Nicholas Mele as Mr. Dennis Johnson and Jacquelyn Masche as Mrs. Crusel. Englund still does well being devilishly amusing and sinister with his kills, and by the time of this film became part of popular culture, the story is a little too similar to the previous, obviously the best things about this sequel are the main antagonist and the inventive murders in the dreams, overall it is not a bad horror film. Worth watching!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
6,ccthemovieman-1,Freddy''s Funniest Film,6,15 April 2006,"This doesn't have the well-known cast of the previous Nightmare 3 movie but the special effects are still good.....each very different and some of them very funny. They make this perhaps the most entertaining entry in the series.Memorable scenes include a junkyard, a water bed, a classroom, faces in a pizza, a girl bench pressing and faces coming out of Freddy's flesh. The storyline, however, features its usual dumb and ridiculous theology and has its usual share of unlikable obnoxious teens. Their parents weren't pictured as any better, perhaps worse.In fact, the kids and parents are so bad you wind up rooting for Freddy to do them in. Perhaps that's the idea!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
7,Tweekums,Reports of Freddy's death were somewhat exaggerated,7,9 July 2017,"After the events of the previous film Kristen, and fellow 'Dream Warriors' Kincaid, and Joey, are living ordinary lives. She believes that Freddy isn't dead though and pulls them into her dreams again they are convinced otherwise and find it rather irritating then Kincaid dreams about the junkyard where and Freddy appears and kills him; later Joey is also killed. Kristen is terrified that she will have to face Freddy alone. She talks to her friend Alice about it and she says she knows of a way of controlling your dreams. Kristen tries this but after appearing to work it turns out she is in another nightmare a nightmare that she pulls Alice into. Freddy kills Kristen but something strange happens afterwards part of Kristen enters Alice and is absorbed into her personality. She now has the ability to unwittingly pull people into her dreams and each time she does Freddy kills them and she gains part of their personality; this once mousy girl gets tougher each time and is finally ready to confront Freddy.This is a decent enough sequel which brings some new ideas to the franchise. It opens well enough with the return of Freddy and the deaths of Kincaid, and Joey. Kristen survived long enough for it to look as though she would be the protagonist so when she did die it was a bit of a surprise. At this point Alice quickly became the obvious protagonist; I liked how her character absorbed aspects of Kristen and later victims' personalities as it justified the character's rapid development from a quiet girl to somebody who could face Freddy. Lisa Wilcox did a solid job as Alice and Tuesday Knight was pretty good as Kristen. The rest of the young cast were okay for the most part. Robert Englund is fun as the evil Freddy but the attempts at humour make the character less scary. Director Renny Harlin did a good job in one of his earlier films; it isn't surprising that he went on to bigger things. The special effects are pretty impressive. Overall this is a decent enough film; if you enjoyed the previous films in the series you should enjoy this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
8,BA_Harrison,How bad can these films get? Watch this and find out.,3,1 May 2007,"After Freddy was defeated by the Dream Warriors (and his remains buried in consecrated ground) in part 3, it seemed to me that scriptwriters might never be able to think of a plausible way to bring back the char-grilled lunatic for more teen slaying. But I hadn't reckoned on the brilliant minds behind the series finding that obvious loophole in the whole Krueger mythos: fiery dog urine. That's right... a dog peeing on Freddy's junkyard burial site reawakens the kiddie killer in what must be one of the most preposterous openings to a popular horror movie.After this, things go from bad to worse, making Dream Master barely better than the abysmal, and much reviled, Pt. 2 (Freddy's Revenge).With Freddy returning from hell to slaughter again, the surviving three Elm Street children are once again in peril. Kristen (Tuesday Knight, replacing Patricia Arquette), who has the power to pull others into her dreams, is powerless to rescue fellow Dream Warriors Joey and Kincaid, and, after their deaths, is also attacked. However, before she dies, she manages to pull her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox) into her dream and passes on her special skill.Freddy, wishing to carry on slicing and dicing, uses an unwilling Alice to gain access to 'fresh meat': he terrorizes Alice in her dreams until she unwittingly pulls someone in with herand then he kills them.But as Freddy does away with each of Alice's pals, the once timid girl becomes more powerful (and sexy), acquiring the skills of each victim. Eventually, she does battle with the soul stealing sicko, and, in another excellent stroke of genius by the writers (do you sense the sarcasm?), doesn't defeat him with her brother's karate skills or her friends sonic bug-killer (I would explain, but it really isn't worth the effort), but by making him look in a mirror. That's right... apparently, seeing himself in a mirror is just too much for him to handle, and he is unable to stop the souls trapped inside his body from tearing themselves free.There are so many cringe-worthy moments in this film that to name them all would take forever, but among the worst are the victim transformed into a bug (nice effects, stupid idea), a daydream in which Alice chats to her dead brother, the beach scene which sees Freddy donning Raybans, a badly handled 'deja vu' sequence that goes on and on and on, and ALL of Freddy's jokes.Oh, and that bloody awful 'Are You Ready For Freddy?' rap song during the end credits, of course!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
9,Quinoa1984,"Somewhat exceptable, to say the most",6,27 September 2000,"I found that as far as horror films go, this was ok (thanks to some f/x), but as a Nightmare on Elm street film, it was less than good.  Freddy this time brings some good wisecracks and some good kills (bye bye Larry), but the plot is so thin and sucky it is almost unwatchable.  For die-hard fans of the series or if you are bored on a saturday night.  Others might wanna go for part 3.  B-",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
10,BandSAboutMovies,Enjoyed way more than expected,6,4 October 2018,"I've often written off all of these films after the first three - one being the originator, two being a strange metaphor for growing up gay and the third being a bravura Dokken soundtrack sporting thrill ride that was amongst the first slasher films I ever watched.The thing is, part four is slick and as commercial as it gets, but isn't that what you want? Aren't we all wistful for the movie theaters of thirty years ago, when films like Bad Dreams, the Chuck Russell remake of The Blob, Child's Play, Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, Fright Night II, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Phantasm II, Poltergeist 3, Pumpkinhead and so many more graced the silver screen? This is a movie made for teenagers to devour in the same way that they chow down through a pizza - more on that in a bit.After the final battle in the last film in this series - Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors - which was intended by Wes Craven to end the franchise. With original protagonist Nancy sacrificing herself to stop Krueger, the rest of the Dream Warriors have been released from the insane asylum and are back to being normal teenagers.However, Kristen (Tuesday Knight, replacing Patricia Arquette) believes that Freddy isn't dead, drawing Joey, Kincaid and Kincaid's dog Jason into her dream, where they show her that Freddy's boiler is cold. There's been a rift between these former friends, as the boys are seen as freaks and Kristen has joined the popular crowd with her martial arts practicing boyfriend Rick (Andras Jones, Sorority Girls in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama), Alice, Sheila and Debbie.Soon, Kincaid has been killed in the junkyard from Dream Warriors, where Freddy comes back after a dog urinates fire onto him. Yes, that really happens. Then, Joey finds a naked girl swimming in his waterbed in a sequence that's glossy, ridiculous and awesome all in equal measure. He's soon dead and Kristen passes out when she finds out, bringing Freddy after her. She swears to get revenge, but once her mother gives her sleeping pills to ensure that she gets rest, she is felled by the ""Son of a One Hundred Maniacs."" However, she is able to give her dream power to Alice which she's gonna need because with each kill, Freddy gains the abilities and personalities of Alice's dead friends.Sure, these movies would get much worse, but if you're looking for a movie that'll make the middle of the night just fly past, you can't go wrong with this one. I was surprised how much I liked it, which is kind of the point of this challenge, right?This movie is filled with plenty of out there kill scenes and flip dialogue that finally makes Freddy the actual hero of the film. There's a girl that gets turned into a cockroach and smashed into a Roach Motel. And then there's the scene where Freddy shows Alice all of his victims on a ""soul pizza"" that must be witnessed to be believed.Say what you will about Renny Harlin, but in this follow up to his American debut Prison, he really takes the series all the way into the surreal, basing each of the murders on actual nightmares that he had, as well as crazy moments that push the film into meta territory when Alice goes from a movie theater into an actual movie while the rest of the cast watches.This was the highest grossing movie in the series until Freddy vs. Jason, which it earns with an all-star team of special effects artists, a soundtrack boasting bands like the Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Blondie, and the Fat Boys, and an ending that boasts a twenty foot tall practical model of Freddy being destroyed by the souls of those he has taken.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
11,Coventry,"Freddy "" Big Business "" Krueger ...",6,16 July 2003,"Only a small year after ""Dream Warriors"" got released episode 4 pops up. A small difference in time but a major difference to the image of the series. Freddy is at the top of his popularity in this movie and that's well stressed. The audience wanted to see much more of Freddy and that's what they've got. Freddy looks more like a stand-up comedian than as a horrible killer. He still does the killings of course (otherwise you don't have a movie, right) but he can't do it anymore without shooting funny one-liners towards the audience. ""How's this for a wet dream, Joey?"" This way, his loses much of his scary image but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, of course. In fact, it's still my third favorite episode in the series. The original and Dream Warriors are n°1 and 2 and I didn't like New Nightmare at all (shoot me if you want) The old formula is respected and a few very original twists are added. Joey, Kincaid and Kirsten (a transformation from Patricia Arquette into Tuesday Weld) are the only survivors from the original Elm Street parents who burnt Freddy. Freddy finishes them but of course his urge to kill isn't stopped by that...what do you expect, he's a maniac isn't he ? So he needs new victims. Alice is the perfect person to provide this for him. She has the strange gift to bring other people into her dream and that's where they are accessible to Freddy. Lucky for him, Alice entered the dream which killed Kirsten so through Alice he can still his never-ending hunger to kill... Patricia Arquette ain't a member of the cast anymore but as the leading actress she gets well replaced by Lisa Wilcox. All the other characters aren't very much worth to be mentioned and they all die, so... After Craven himself, Jack Sholder and Chuck Russel, Renny Harlin took a seat in the directors ' chair. Harlin is a rather good director who also made ""Prison"". A very scary horror film which I recommend as well. After NOES 4, he made much bigger budget films like Die Hard 2, Cliffhangerand Deep Blue Sea. The Dream Master (the title refers to Alice herself) is the last ""good"" nightmare on Elm Street. Episode 5 was just plain stupid and looked more like a bad comic book. Freddy's Dead - The final Nightmare has his moments but overall it sucks and don't get me started about New Nightmare. Killings are original with some great make-up effects, the soundtrack is great, the acting and directing are decent, the script is funny and keeps you focused (the déjà-vu scene is a great example of this) and Freddy is uglier than ever. Now, let's all start singing : one-two Freddy is coming for you....",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
12,michaelRokeefe,Freddy Krueger isn't finished,7,4 January 2021,"This seems to be a fan favorite of the franchise. Freddy Krueger is not finished terrorizing the dreams of the remaining Dream Warriors.

14,hitchcockthelegend,How sweet. Fresh meat.,6,8 June 2013,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is directed by Renny Harlin and written by Brian Helgeland and Scott Pierce. It stars Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Andras Jones, Tuesday Knight, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman and Brooke Theiss. Music is by John Easdale and Craig Safan and cinematography by Steven Fierberg.Freddy Krueger (Englund) is back again to finish off the last of the Dream Warriors, but when he enters the dreams of a new girl, Alice Johnson (Wilcox), he gets more than he bargained for...In spite of part three being something of a return to form for the Elm Street franchise, it still signalled the point where Krueger as a character started to become more fun villain than a terrifying presence. By the time this fourth instalment rolled around, Krueger was iconic for sure, but also he was a marketing tool for merchandise, even getting his own spin-off TV show. Where once was this vile child murderer invading the dreams of children and killing them, now is a guy selling dolls and someone more known for a quip than a kill.Dream Master follows the basic Elm Street formula, Krueger returns to kill more kids in their dreams. The methods range from the icky (insect) to the impressive (pizza), and the effects work is mostly enjoyable. The tying up of loose ends shows some modicum of thought in the writing, while the big finale is actually worth the wait. However, the acting away from a perky Wilcox is pretty poor and familiarity of formula does indeed breed contempt. It's just about above average as a whole, thanks in the main to the inventive kills, but as this third sequel coined it in at the box office, with that comes the basic fact that Kruegerville is a town built only for cash purposes. 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
15,utgard14,"""Wanna suck face?""",4,27 October 2015,"The first truly terrible entry in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I know some would argue part 2 was but I think it had some good parts despite its flaws. This one is pure crap, beginning with the moronic idea to kill off three popular characters who survived part 3. You don't crap on the Dream Warriors and still be considered a good movie. The plot to this one involves the gifted girl from the last film (played by Tuesday Knight, replacing Patricia Arquette) passing on her gift to a friend from school before being killed by Freddy. From that point on it's a by-the-numbers Elm Street sequel with Freddy going after the new girl and all her whitebread friends. The biggest surprise for this stinker is that it's directed by Renny Harlin. Hardly a cinematic legend, Harlin is still a more recognizable name than the other Elm Street directors (excluding Wes Craven, of course). He was on the rise at this time and still had his biggest hits ahead of him (mostly action films). His direction here is not bad and he does craft some decent nightmare scenes. But the script is a dog and the cast is among the worst of any of the sequels in this series. The standout being, of course, the returning Ken Sagoes as the scene-stealing Kincaid. Unfortunately, he's not in the movie for very long. The best thing about the movie, I suppose, is that there are a lot of cheesy laughs from Freddy. We're in full-on camp territory for Freddy at this point. Some fans love that and some do not. I think I fall into the ""do not"" category. It just takes away from him being scary in any way when he's constantly making bad jokes. Despite how much this one sucks, it is (sadly) not the worst of the series. Things were going to go from bad to worse with part 5.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
16,Boba_Fett1138,Weak sequel that gets better toward the end.,5,5 October 2009,"This movie begins as an incredible weak and just plain lame on. It seems like one of those sequels that add nothing to the series. In essence ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" is also truly adding nothing but the movie really gets better toward the end, when the movie becomes more interesting to watch with its horror.For most part the movie still remains a mess though. The storytelling in its beginning is so weak and the story itself seems to be written s some big B-movie script, with lame kind of dialog in it and some not so very original moments.As an horror movie it's also lacking. It doesn't use its main character Freddy Krueger a lot, at least not until its ending. The movie at times also tires to pathetically put in some scare moments, that you however can see coming from miles away, since the movie isn't being a very original one and it also isn't a very well made one. Renny Harlin has never excelled in directing great movies and this movie was his first 'big one'.The movie is basically being a direct sequel to the third movie but unfortunately the movie never become as great to watch. It uses some characters and actors from the third movie but the movie makes the mistake of killing them all basically off early on and is introducing some new uninteresting characters, which are basically all more of the same again. Story-wise the movie also doesn't have a lot to do with the third part, which makes it all the more pointless.The movie is really lacking in some fresh ideas of its own. It's settings, characters and narrative all aren't very original or surprising ever and it at all times remains a predictable movie to watch, that also isn't being much good as an horror.The movie does feature some nice effects in it and some of the killings are also done quite well, as had basically always been the case within the series. It's perhaps too campy to find it really gory or shocking, or anything, but it gives the movie a nice and professional look over it nevertheless.The movie however finds its right pace to late and the movie also gets to made interesting far too late. Yet the movie its second halve prevent this movie from being an horrible one and still make this movie somewhat watchable, especially for the fans of the series of course.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,There can be only one... as if it was the amount that was the problem,5,2 August 2010,"Yup, they stuck with the idea of the teens having powers in dreams. Also, this time, they can be transferred, because that makes this ever-so-slightly different from #3. The directorial reins have been passed on to Renny Harlin, who evidently wasn't new to the idea of a sequel that has nothing on the original when he made Die Hard 2. He made Deep Blue Sea, too. I hear Driven is terrible, as well. At this point, it seems like they were running on fumes. There are few creative gags, and the FX are hit and miss(granted, there *are* great ones among them). The trend of going for the weird and bizarre over being creepy(which it seldom is), and it certainly succeeds. Trust me, you will utter at least a handful of ""wtf's"" in your initial viewing of this. We get clichéd attempts at being scary instead of the sense of being trapped in a nightmare(granted, the lighting and a bit or two at least make the effort). Krueger gives us excellent one-liners again, and they are the best thing about this. The characters are mostly obnoxious or uninteresting, and this has too many of them, so we don't get to know all of them, much less care about them. Several of the kids return from the third one, and the same actors(other than Arquette, who was pregnant). Well, maybe that word is excessively flattering. Other than Englund(incapable of being poor in a film), no one delivers a good performance in this. Why does this open and close with *pop music*? If you can't produce more than 83 minutes sans credits of a flick, do you really have enough material? Is the gradual decline in the quality of the climax and conclusion in this series intentional? Early in this, Kincaid utters the following: ""Aw, Kristen, not again"". I concur. There is a lot of disturbing content and gruesome, bloody, gory violence, a little strong language and brief nudity. The Ultimate Collector's Edition 7-Disc DVD set comes with the feature Jump To A Nightmare and a trailer. I recommend this to those desperate for a follow-up in this franchise. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
18,view_and_review,Less,3,30 September 2019,"In ANOES 3 Freddy was dispatched. His bones were found and consecrated thereby killing him off for good.But what's dead really? Death for Freddy Krueger is such an impermanent thing that's why he has reemerged in part 4.Three pesky kids escaped his clutches in part 3 so he's back to finish the job. The three remaining kids are the offspring of the parents that burned Freddy to death. If Krueger could just get his claws on those three pieces of prey he would be Oh so satisfied. Or would he be? Because in this episode he wants more than just the three leftovers that made his existence miserable in part three, he wants fresh meat. But the rules stipulate that he can only terrorize and kill the children of the adults who burned him. That's a problem.Apparently, Mr. Krueger hired himself an excellent lawyer because he found a loophole in the contract that allowed him to reach other non-Elm Street kids. All he had to do was use one of the Elmies as a conduit in order to gain access to other youth. I know, they were really bending the rules in this one, but that's not even the worst violation.Kristen (Tuesday Knight... I didn't make this name up), who was the special dreamer of part three that could drag others into her dreams, was the bridge for Freddy to other young tenders.Freddy killed her.But, as Kristen was dying, she threw her spirit/essence/metaphysical plasma--or whatever it was--into Alice (Lisa Wilcox). Now Freddy could use Alice as his doorway to the dreams of non-Elm Streeters. How he found this loophole in the rules is beyond me. Freddy seems very adept at circumventing rules in order to kill.Whenever Alice slept (or didn't sleep) and one of her friends slept (or not), Freddy had the ability to kill her friends. There was no rhyme or reason to any of it.This movie was just less. Less scary, less creative, less enjoyable. Even Freddy mailed it in. He only seemed to have a partial bloodlust. Freddy and ANOES are so much better than what they showed this episode. I expect better from them next episode.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
19,Uriah43,Repetitious at Times,5,16 June 2020,"This film essentially takes up where its predecessor left off with the three surviving ""Dream Warriors"" named ""Kristen"" (Tuesday Knight), ""Kincaid"" (Ken Sagoes) and ""Joey"" (Rodney Eastman) having been released from the mental care facility and returned back to families under the assumption that ""Freddy Krueger"" (Robert Englund) has been killed. Needless to say, their assumption proves incorrect as it's at this time that he returns and begins to hunt each of them down one-by-one and in so doing comes upon another teenager by the name of ""Alice"" (Lisa Wilcox) who subsequently becomes a conduit for Freddy to terrorize other high school students as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had good potential and was backed up with outstanding special effects. Unfortunately, the director (Renny Harlin) relied too heavily upon the special effects to the point that the scenes became somewhat repetitious with one person after another falling victim to Freddy without the necessary suspense to back it up. That said, while this film wasn't that bad, it wasn't quite as good as a couple of the others in the franchise and I have rated it accordingly.

20,anaconda-40658,Dream Master Dreams Bad.,2,9 September 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master (1988): Dir: Renny Harlin / Cast: Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox, Danny Hassle, Brooke Theiss, Tuesday Knight: A major decline in quality after the innovation of the original. The subtitle seems to reference the idea of taking back control. In this case Lisa Wilcox is witnessing the deaths of everyone around her within her own dreams. The film opens with nightmare scorched skin Freddy Krueger invading the nightmares of the previous film's survivors and knocking them off. After that he goes after a classroom full of students with various methods of killing people. The special effects showcase various gruesome images that are the only area of payoff. Robert Englund is Freddy under the scary makeup but here the character is reduced to one-liners and cheap insults. Characters are cardboard and basically lined up for a slaughter. Wilcox goes from timid teenager isolated from her father to taking the unbelievable fight with Freddy. Tuesday Knight is featured largely in the first half before passing the torch to Wilcox to avoid further association with this crap. Director Renny Harlin doesn't present the chills nearly as successfully as Wes Craven did in the original. Instead it becomes a big joke based around killings and special effects. Perhaps the next time the Dream Master goes to sleep she can render up a screenplay worthy of Freddy. Score: 2 / 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular",8,2 May 2016,"Still troubled by their experience with Freddy, a group of friends begin to suddenly disappear one-by-one forcing one of them to realize the connection they have to Freddy and forcing them to utilize that in order to defeat him once and for all.This one was decidedly enjoyable if not entirely spectacular. One of the few good parts to this one is that, as in so many of the others in the series this one really gets a large part of it's charm through the stellar use of the dream sequences, which are top-notch as always. The opening return of the gang in the boiler room gets this off to a solid start, though most certainly the highlight here comes from the encounter in the car graveyard which is quite fun with the initial appearance, the dog bringing Freddy back to life and eventually stalking him through the twisting walkways inside and the different confrontations they have which makes for a truly exciting and enjoyable scene here. As well, other big scenes include the beach-front dream that's quite exciting for really going through with a rather gruesome ending, the martial arts battle in the dojo is quite fun and the visions of her and her friends at the movie theater as they watch her playing in the diner which makes for a great overall time here, while later scenes include the seriously chilling and creepy runaround as they try to stop their friend being turned into a cockroach in one of his traps and the fun car-crash which leads into the incredibly enjoyable and twisted finale where they battle him through the church using the collected powers to put up a great fight and getting an incredibly unique climax that works rather nicely here in keeping true to the series' strengths. Again, there's also plenty to like about the Freddy make-up here who looks as imposing as ever and manages to make the kills creative and intriguing with how they play out here leading to some impressive moments, all which manage to hold this one up over the few flaws here. The main thing that really tends to hurt this one is the fact that there's just nothing all that intriguing here about the storyline about yet another group of kids stuck under the spell of Freddy. Using a spectacularly lame and petty contrivance to get him back doesn't really help as the finality of what happened previously seems to get undone in an truly underwhelming manner and never really offers much of a way to get this one going in any kind of official manner for his purpose attacking them. Likewise, this also forces the film into a rather disheartening tone of simply going from kill scene to kill scene without doing much in between to really move this along as each of the grandiose kill scenes come at odds with the rather low-key set-up scenes that really showcase the outlandishness of what's happening at extreme cases to really make this quite uneven. As well, the fact that we're stuck in the Freddy- isms is a little bit of a problem with him being far too cheesy at times to work with the attempt to make him frightening. Beyond these issues, this one isn't that bad.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and continuous underage smoking.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

However, Kristen, who has the ability to draw others into her dreams, wills her special ability to her friend Alice before her demise. Afterwards, Alice soon realises that Freddy is taking advantage of that unknown power she now wields to pull a new group of teenage children into his foul domain.......For a fourth movie, the idea of having Freddy use someone to attract victims is sound, but with this, the fourth (and most successful) movie of the franchise, the films were verging on parody, and Freddy, the dream demon, was becoming more and more endearing with every fresh kill.And the reason being is simple, everyone was looking forward to what the punch line would be, what one liner would Freddy spout out when he killed again?Freddy wasn't scary anymore, the makers knew this,so they just injected more special effects and tried to have more inventive deaths. It worked in 3, but the quality of the films dropped dramatically when the studios became more interested in the numbers, rather than Cravens creation.But it's short,the music is hilarious, and Englund is having a whale of a time playing Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Here Freddy has almost totally ditched his sinister and creepy persona and replaced it with Freddy Krueger...master of the one liner.  Once again the kids must take a stand against Freddy and once again dream manipulation is a part of it.  Not as much so as in part 3 as Freddy makes quick work of most of the kids.  Here he kills in very dumb ways though and his trademark claws kill only one guy and Freddy's hand wasn't even in them at the time.  There is also one of the dumbest death scenes in the movies that involves a roach motel.  After all the kids are dead the main one who you knew would survive gets a bunch of her friends mementos and uses them to battle Freddy, though they are not all that effective.  In the end this was not a really good movie...all the promise from the first one is gone and there is just too much joking going on.

24,Wuchakk,"Cash-grab 4th ""Nightmare"" ain't bad, and features cutie Tuesday Knight",5,17 September 2017,"RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by Renny Harlin, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" details the resurrection of Freddy (Robert Englund) and his goal to wipe out the remaining Elm Street kids from the previous movie (Rodney Eastman & Ken Sagoes) before turning his attention to a new batch, which includes a surprisingly formidable young woman (Lisa Wilcox).The director, Harlin, was basically a no-name before this movie, but after its surprise success at the box office, the most profitable ""Nightmare"" flick up to this point, he went on to direct major Hollywood flicks, like ""Die Hard 2"" (1990), ""Cliffhanger"" (1993), the doomed ""Cutthroat Island"" (1995) and ""Deep Blue Sea"" (1999). In an interview he laughed when asked about ""Nightmare 4,"" explaining that he was basically hired to do a rush job due to the previous one's unexpected success (1988's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors""). The producers gave him a deadline, a small budget and a five-page outline for a screenplay. They obviously weren't concerned with the quality of the movie; they just wanted to put out another ""Nightmare"" as-soon-as-possible as a cash-grab. Harlin took the job; pretty much writing the dialogue as they moved along. Winsome Tuesday Knight is a highlight, but her presence is never really capitalized on even though she has a beach scene (and I'm not talking about nudity or porn). Still, her role is respectably beefy. Lisa Wilcox emerges as the protagonist and has a good story arc, but they coulda done more with her as well. Speaking of the women, pin-up girl and B-flick actress Hope Marie Carlton has a cameo.There are some creative parts, like the cockroach and soul-pizza sequences. The movie perhaps works best as a period-piece of 1987 (when it was shot) and is surprisingly good in light of the challenge Harlin faced.

26,StevePulaski,A film further plunging its franchise down into a neverending trench of inconsistency,5,22 October 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is the point in the franchise where comedy began to eclipse the franchise's almost unbridled devotion to horror sensibilities. It was the film that turned Freddy Krueger into a pop culture figure, capable of regurgitating every lackluster pun imaginable like an MTV VJ rather than a horror figure you'd hate to see in your nightmares. Finally, it was the film to bear the franchise's peak budget, showing it off by including very elaborate and immaculately detailed dream sequences that toyed with the perception of reality in a manner so believable that you swore you were being haunted yourself. It's safe to say that the series most expensive installment also turned out to be its most divisive and revolutionary.The story picks up on characters from Dream Warriors, the previous installment, such as Kristen (Tuesday Knight), Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), and Joey (Rodney Eastman), all of whom have been released from the mental hospital that confined them for the past months and back into the public school system and their normal homes. Kristen winds up reacquainting her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox) and her boyfriend Rick (Andras Jones), and is enjoying living her normal life until she realizes that dreaming of, or even expressing paranoia over, Freddy Krueger, the burned-faced, sweater-clad killer that haunted them before, could potentially make him return. When Freddy (Robert Englund, the only constant in this series, so it seems) winds up returning to haunt the victims in his dreams, the focus lies in Alice, as she's the most ignorant of Freddy's ways.Consistency has long been a problem with this franchise and The Dream Master shows a refusal for it to accept any kind of remote pattern. Because of the constant directorial and screen writing shakeups, and Craven's varying and largely debatable involvement with each individual film, little in the way of tonal or narrative cohesion could be retained. The overall scope and reach of the Freddy Krueger character got hazy with the second film and found itself resorting back into the laws of the first film, with no acknowledgement of the second film other than a vague, ambiguous line of dialog from A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. The Dream Master's refusal to assert itself by accepting the emphasis on fear and vulnerability ideas from the first and third film or the metaphorical significance of the Freddy Krueger character is evident by the film's emphasis on comedy from what was previously the franchise's main source for terror.Being that The Dream Master is the most expensive film from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, one can see where director Renny Harlin and his set/production designers wanted to put their emphases - the dream sequences. To the film's credit, the dream sequences are the most elaborate and well-conceived dream sequences the franchise has yet to see, even more-so believable and immersive than in Dream Warriors. Consider the scene where Kincaid is trapped in a nightmarish junkyard that molds and crafts itself at what is ostensibly the snap of Freddy's fingers, effectively trapping him in a sea of broken-down cars that is revealed to be a lot bigger in scope than we could've imagined. The scene works beautifully because it focuses on the core idea of being trapped in a dream lucid enough for you to actively move around and possess your own decision-making skills but not lucid enough where you can control the dream. The result is especially terrifying and this is one of the few dream sequences where Freddy is mostly serious.The remainder of the dream scenes only get more decorated in appearance, and continue to live up to this first major one in size and scope. The problem is, with each sequence, Freddy gets less and less convincing. Writers Brian Helgeland (who would go on to direct Oscar-nominated screenplays for films like L.A. Confidential and Mystic River) and Scott Pierce turn Freddy into a pun/quip machine, who seems to always be in search for the next cheeky line to say rather than anything that provokes a kind of uneasiness for the audience. This desecration of a frightening character, turning him into a second rate comedian, significantly lessens his effectiveness as a character, especially when we see him command some of the most visually stunning locations he has yet to be apart of in the entire series.Finally, though it's a relatively minor, almost moot, point, the acting here has noticeably taken a turn for the worst. The Dream Master feels like a lackluster display of amateur-hour, Second City acting, particularly from the likes of Tuesday Knight and Andras Jones, who just do an immensely poor job at being believable screen presences. While acting in horror films is traditionally never the first thing one judges on, when it's so wooden, as it is here, it can't help be a jarring feature, especially when the film itself already isn't particularly good.A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 works in the way it decides to further construct and elaborate on the many worlds of which Freddy inhabits, in addition with taking on some seriously twisted and quirky scenes the franchise has never seen before. However, it does a miserable job of sticking to whatever guns the series had drawn at this point by sacrificing scares for cheap quips and capable actors for whomever could fill the part quickly and inexpensively. The result is a film that was evidently rushed on every level that wasn't visual effects or production design.Starring: Lisa Wilcox, Robert Englund, Tuesday Knight, Andras Jones, Ken Sagoes, and Rodney Eastman.

27,Smells_Like_Cheese,The plot was like a cheesy TV series,6,11 November 2003,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, the fourth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I was lucky enough to get the boxed DVD set of Nightmare on Elm Street series and I just finished all the sequels and while the fourth isn't a bad sequel or continuation of the story, it was pretty silly. It was cool to continue on with the dream warriors who were clever enough to defeat Freddy in the third Nightmare on Elm Street. But Freddy's back and he is more ticked off than ever and you know that's not good. But while the story was a good idea, the way it was executed, I wasn't really that into it, just the acting I think is what killed it for me. The way the movie was made was what made it feel like it was more of a cheesy TV show like on the Sci-fi Channel than an actual movie.We start off where the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series left off, the kids from the hospital are now grown up and are all on their own. But they are quickly killed off by Freddy hoping to get Kirsten back to help them, but they are too late. But when Kirsten finds a girl, Alice, she finds out that Alice has the same powers as she does. She has the ability to pull other people into her dreams and of course Alice is scared to find out how to use her powers, but she may just have to use them since Freddy is now after her and other kids too.A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master was a good enough sequel, but it just could have been better. I liked it, but so far it's not my top favorite sequel. Again, we've got some very cool deaths, don't think I could choose one, I think the water bed one was very cool. But once again, I don't wanna spoil it. Of course if you wanna see the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, this is recommended, but as a horror movie on it's own, it's OK.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
28,Rainey-Dawn,Needed More Freddy,6,23 October 2016,"This film started out extremely good but I was not crazy about ending... I'm not pleased with the ""supergirl"" idea seemingly ending the life of Freddy Krueger (of course Freddy comes back but the keyword here is ""seemingly""). And Freddy as usual messes with her as he always messes with the ones he is about ready to kill - and he had plenty of chances to kill her but she seemingly gets him first and Freddy didn't get a chance to damage her before that happened which bothered me. Seriously, I just wanted Freddy to kick ""supergirl's"" butt and the credits roll.It also bothered me that Freddy was not in this one as much as I was hoping he would be - he wasn't shown all that much here. OK just call a Freddy lover (and I am) but I really believe they lagged just a little bit by not showing Krueger as much in this one, and it's Freddy we all wanted to see! What we do see of him is great, he's a sinister and twisted as always! The film just needed more of that - just my opinion.6.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
29,OllieSuave-007,More nightmares.,5,13 August 2014,"I really don't remember much from this film, so it is evident that this movie didn't stand out much in the series, which is winding down by this time. Like Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th series, Freddy Krueger is like a case of the bad plague, always returning and menacing people over and over again. This time around, he returns once again and terrorizes the dreams of the surviving Dream Warriors. In the meantime, Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) soon realizes Freddy's new unknown powers and now attempts to defeat the demon for good with a new group of teenagers.It's more of the screams, dreams and mangling with some campy and amateurish acting. There is nothing too newer than in the previous Nightmare entries - it's basically a continuation of the previous film, and features another heroic girl with a plan to put a stop to the scarred demon. You end up rooting for her to see how and if a successful end would meet Freddy.The script is pretty basic and the plot is even weirder than in the previous films. It's OK for a good scare, maybe even a laugh, or two.

30,thesar-2,You shouldn't have buried him. He's not dead.,10,12 January 2010,"I make no apologies on awarding A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 5/5 stars. And I certainly don't consider it a ""guilty pleasure."" Let's say I grew up on this movie. It was one of my initial ""Movie Event of the Year"" films as I watched it 5 times in the theatre in 1988, all at the now defunct AMC Gateway. (Twice alone, twice with my sister and the final time with my father who wanted to know what ""evil"" I was watching so many times.) Also, since I was so young (14, and I am puzzled on how I frequently got into a rated R flick – even my sister was younger than 17) not only was this my first introduction to Freddy – I hadn't seen 1-3 yet, this movie made a huge impact on my future movie-going experiences as well as my life.It's strange to even think about rewarding a #4 in a 1980s horror franchise more than, say 2½ stars, but I absolutely loved this movie. The soundtrack (which I had bought and have listened to hundreds of times, we'll get more on that later), the score, the comedic tones, the frights, the fights, the inventiveness and the acting. They really up'd the ante this time with an obvious budget and special effects. But more so, Freddy finally came out of the closet, so to speak.Not only was he absolutely hilarious, we finally got to see more of him and his glove. I obviously didn't know at the time how privileged the audience was to finally see him out of the shadows and into the limelight where he (and his clever one-liners) belong. I guess some might have problem with that – they probably felt he was more ""scary"" hidden away. I didn't. I felt he was too strong of a character not to show.Well, Freddy's back, but mostly because Kristen (the newly replaced Tuesday Knight, due to Arquette being pregnant, and Knight also did the wonderful opening song) couldn't leave well enough alone and kept thinking of him in her dreams. She also has a bad knack for involving others in her dreams, including #3's survivors Joey & Kincaid.When Freddy eventually stalks them and murders them (including one of the series most memorable/creative death – ""How's this for a wet dream?"") the series actually keeps continuity by stating Freddy's mission was to murder all of the original ""Elm Street Children"" and these were the final three. Kristen does manage to transfer her power of pulling someone into the dream to another innocent she pulled into the dream, Alice (Wilcox.) Positive: this gives someone else the opportunity to defeat Freddy. Negative: most likely Freddy would've been done with his task complete.Alice, sweet Alice, doesn't know what to think of all this, barely being informed of the back story earlier. In fact, had she been a little more prepared, she might not of inadvertently brought her friends into her own dreams for Freddy to collect souls. As Alice attempts to put the pieces together there's another side effect – just like with Kristen, she collects their powers, or personalities, habits (smoking, bad!) and strengths. Freddy's not stupid and plans to stop her before she stops him. Does he succeed? Does she happen to remember an old nursery rhyme at the most opportune time to defeat the man of their nightmares? Duh.I loved this movie on so many levels. I have the entire movie memorized, shot-by-shot, frame-by-frame and all the dialogue in between. So much so, I have to consciously stop myself from quoting it so I can enjoy the 30th time viewing it. I loved the soundtrack, but some songs were vacant. For those, I had to search – way pre-internet – by asking around school while just humming some of the lyrics. (The ones missing went onto become some of my favorite songs: Anything, Anything by Dramarama and I Want Your Hands On Me by Sinead O'Connor. Do you know how hard life is without the internet to look things up!?!?) I always love a good female combatant, but the nerdy-girl Alice (the very BEST Nightmare heroine, sorry, Nancy fans) turned warrior wasn't just awesome, but beautiful and a great challenge for the exciting climax/showdown in the church in the closing. In addition, since I was about the same age, give or take a couple of years, of most of the teens in this movie, I can safely say: they got how teens act and what they say down to a tee, much like any of the John Hughes movies.The death/nightmare scenes weren't just clever and topical (for the time) but they kept the story going, whether you were laughing or reminiscing in the moments. Freddy proved himself as the number one villain of all 1980s horror franchises. It's no wonder this was the top grossing of all the Nightmare films (if you don't count Freddy Vs. Jason.) I loved seeing Freddy at his best and especially his glove – many a scene they acted like his claws/knifes sprung like Wolverine's. I loved seeing him in different costumes and with as many one-liners as most comedies.On a personal note, as a critic (in my own mind-dammit) I generally will always try to be unbiased. Such as, a movie of this stature would be 4 to 4½ stars with all the (non-personal remembrance) positives I mentioned. But, for once, I am taking this to a personal level and how much this movie meant to me. To hell with the majority of critics, the audience and my own personal impartial views – even when the movie is dear to me. I am selfishly rewarding this the highest rating due to how much it means to me.See it anyways. It's fun horror.

31,gridoon,One of the best - highly imaginative!,6,18 November 1999,"""Nightmare on Elm Street 4"" is one of the best entries in the series. Okay, the first is considered a classic, maybe because it had a feeling of poetic surrealism that is indeed lost here. But, come on, it is the FOURTH Freddy film, did you REALLY expect it to be scary? Freddy delivers indeed too many puns, however some of them actually hit the mark. After all, the quality of a slasher film doesn't depend exclusively on how ""serious"" and ""vicious"" the killer is - he was more serious in ""Part 2"", which was an embarrassment, he was less serious in ""Part 3"", which was an imaginative, entertaining film. As for ""Part 4"", it has way-above-average acting, a polished look (just compare it to some early ""Friday The 13th"" cheapies) and some gruesome, stunning visual effects. Above all, the movie exploits more possibilities about the links between reality and dreams than the ""classic"" original did. It is worth seeing.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
32,lost-in-limbo,Did enough to keep me awake.,6,29 August 2009,"Freddy's back to slog it out again. The fourth installment in the series would be the one where it exploded at the box-office and would go on to cement Freddy Krueger as a house-hold horror icon and film's asset of being the major star. New Line Cinema must have seen something in it, to heavily back this addition (easily outdoing the first three in production quality) because it was well produced. As for the 'Elm Street' series, I didn't really care much for it. The first film was great, but the rest didn't strike up much. However out of the sequels I would probably favour this one, just over 'Part 3: The Dream Warriors'. And part 4 pretty much continues on from the last sequel having the remaining survivors (and some fresh meat) encountering Freddy.At the director's helm is Renny Harlin, just starting a career in feature length presentations. He brings to the project a rather polished touch to his stylish scope in what is a visually gimmicky, fast moving and almost 80's jukebox enterprise. There's a large-scale feel to it being pumped with colorful atmospherics (imaginative dreams and silly deaths) and an onslaught of outrageously crude rubber special effects, as the story plays second fiddle to it's erratic clip-by-clip structure. Nonetheless it's an original concept tacked on to a well-worn and at times daft nightmare ride, but the developments within the first hour is quite unpredictable (even with some pushy sap moments). It's too bad after that the characters we are left with, aren't as interesting to completely carry it through and the anti-climatic end feels all too easy. Here the humour is more so in-your-face with the bloated script spitting plenty of coarse tongue-in-cheek one-liners. Did it go overboard? Craig Safan's airily eerie score along with the swirling camera-work are well-delivered. Performances are carried off with a certain likability led by the return of Ken Saygoes and Rodney Eastman. Patricia Arquette doesn't, but the beautiful Tuesday Knight plays the character. A pleasant Lisa Wilcox plays opposite to Knight with fun support chipping from Andras Jones, Brooke Theiss, Danny Hassle and Toy Newkirk. The menace was starting to wear off, but Robert Englund remains entreatingly snappy as Krueger.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
33,Robert_duder,Decent follow up continues the fun legendary slasher series,7,9 January 2012,"Many people will tell you the original film was the only good one and then they went off the track but I think Nightmare On Elm Street/Freddy Kreuger films did okay for the following instalments. Their only stumble was #2 in my books. Number three was a worthy fun sequel and this one...#4 picked up after #3 and brought back some of the good new characters. Yes they went sort of campy with the psychic abilities like many of the slasher flicks do in later instalments but its still fun to watch and not a bad sequel if you like the characters.This time headlining the cast as the 'scream queen' is Lisa Wilcox as quiet and withdrawn Alice Johnson. She's not fantastic but she does a good job and you do root for her. Her brother Rick is played by Andras Jones and he does a good job too and the two of them together have good chemistry. Rodney Eastman and Ken Sagoes return from #3 as Joey and Roland and its always good to have former good guys return to fight the bad guy. It rounded out their story nicely and they are good heroes. Tuesday Knight takes over from Patricia Arquette as Kristen Parker who has overcome many of her issues from the third film and Knight is actually really great in the role!! And of course the legendary Robert Englund brings Freddy back to life and as always he is the lifeblood of the film. Even if he became less scary and more sarcastic he's still amazingly fun to watch and a legendary screen killer.One of his very first films Renny Harlin tells a good story as director and handles his cast well. The setting is good, the story is solid and Nightmare On Elm Street always goes out on a limb to be very imaginative and they manage to push the boundaries because the series is all about dreams and that expands the boundaries a great deal. If you've seen one part of the series you might as well see them all and just go in knowing what to expect and you'll have fun with it. 7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
34,bowmanblue,Freddy at his best,7,2 August 2014,"You'll notice that I say 'Freddy' at his best. In Part 4 of the popular horror franchise, Robert Englund gets top billing and for a reason he's definitely the best part of the film. He's back as the undead child-killer who attacks teenagers in their dreams and this time well, who cares, right? By Part 4 of any horror franchise you pretty much know the set-up. Teens. They dream. They die. It's all pretty standard. However, as I mentioned, what makes it worth seeing is Freddy. He's truly deliciously evil, obviously revelling in his own grisly performance. Plus (and I always thought this aspect elevated the Freddy films over the 'Jason films') because the death scenes happen in a 'dream world' they are always a lot more imaginative and fun than simply seeing a man in a hockey mask chopping a semi-naked teen up.Personally, I enjoy seeing Freddy have fun and 'mess' with his victims. I think it makes him more evil. However, some long-standing fans of the franchise felt that Freddy was getting too 'comical' to be taken seriously. That's one opinion, but I disagree.Basically, Nightmare 4 is worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise or like cheesy eighties horror films. Just don't expect great acting from anyone other than Englund. The other actors really don't seem to be up to the job (or, to be fair on them, this fault could lie with the writers/director) and recite their stilted dialogue with all the conviction of a cheap daytime soap. But then I don't watch this film for them. It's Freddy all the way.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

I do like how they bring back the characters from the previous movie which was my favorite in the series. It's at this point that Freddy became a full on wisecracker. I admit that it's weird people think that Freddy became less of a threat here. I mean, he gave probably his most graphic death in the whole series.He actually causes a girl's arms to fall off and replaced with giant cockroach legs. He then turns the rest of her into a cockroach as he puts her in a roach motel and smashes it. It's probably the most cruel death in the whole series! At this point, the franchise became repetitive. The phrase ""Dream Master"" is barely important at all and is just a term used once or twice. I'm also annoyed at how Freddy is defeated. He looks at himself in a mirror causing the souls of his victims to rip him apart. How did that happen? This is pretty dumb and not worth your time. **",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

41,Dr_Coulardeau,"The mind, the soul, the spirit",9,14 February 2007,"This film brings little semantically. It is the direct sequel of the previous episode, with the same surviving characters who lead to a few new ones. The pattern is the same : Freddy kills a few teenagers and is finally stopped by one of them, a girl again. Yet this film is original in two ways. First its director is extremely experienced in that kind of frightening films. He is an expert in stringing together, one after another frightening elements and effects, and when fear is not used then it is grossness and we move to some level of disgust. Yet we are never terrorized, just horrified and disgusted. Why is that ? Because the audience targeted by the film bans the idea of terrorizing them. The film director doesn't want the film to be restricted. So the film is very careful not to show any unnecessary or just alluring flesh or skin. We are targeting teenagers, so please no sex. Yet in that line of extreme ability at interweaving frightening elements one into the other, the director reflects his time with a few elements that may be surprising for a 1988 film. The characters definitely smoke too much and quite very conspicuously, and yet this gesture of lighting a cigarette is systematically associated with a bad turn in the action. In 1988 we were starting to take measures against tobacco. This film is reflecting this anti-smoking discourse directed at teenagers. This element along with the sexless vision of these young people shows how the American society had changed within ten years and had become very puritanical, though it was going to go a lot further later on. This change, of course brought up by the director, is totally in phase with the second element I want to note here as a new development in the saga. It is the religious dimension of the film. The end takes place in a church. Freddy is destroyed by his own reflection in a piece of color stained glass from a broken color-stained window in that church. Freddy is destroyed by his own reflection and by the rebellion of the souls he had captured and he was holding prisoners in his own body. They tear him apart and finally rip his jaw off and so open the evading door they need to escape. And they do and go directly into heaven. This religious theme is in many ways surprising, and yet not so much. The American society in this 1988 period is slowly moving towards some kind of self-resourcing in Christianity. The Christians born again were starting to call in the wings, and even to walk in the streets. That was the end of Reagan's presidency and the beginning of George Bush Sr's four years. The theme of religious purity was obviously growing, to the point of using a horror film as the medium to bring the message to teenagers. We then understand why they avoided any theme, element or detail that could have restricted the audience in the name of the protection against sex or even violence that is curbed to a symbolical minimum in this episode.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
42,filipemanuelneto,A good sequel.,5,22 April 2021,"The fourth film in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise is a direct continuation of the previous one, and begins with Freddy Krueger's revenge on the group of teenagers who defeated him before. However, things do not end there, and the film presents a very well elaborated script, in which the villain has many opportunities to scare us, although the credibility of what is told can sometimes be too imaginative.The cast does its job satisfactorily. Robert Englund remains impeccable in the role of Krueger, who immortalized with his way of acting and his surrender. Lisa Wilcox is a good protagonist, Rodney Eastman does a positive job and stands out from the crowd and Tuesday Knight seemed satisfactory, but not particularly notable. Even so, I don't think the cast's work was happier than in the previous film.Technically, it is a very well-made film and appears to have a lot of money invested. The CGI and the special effects are quite good and worked well and there are several deaths and strong scenes with great visual impact. Englund's make-up also looks realistic and detailed, and that makes it disturbing and impactful. There is room for humor, but the film is genuinely tense and the suspense was built in a coherent and skillful way. Dark cinematography with strong colors helps to accentuate this tension and the soundtrack also plays an honorable role, although sometimes it does not seem to sound very good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

The whole movie is just about funny and sadistic ways to kill teens with a punch line from Freddy ! The cast is definitely not as good as the previous ones and even the town, places and people seems to go downwards : there is no more neat families, high-schools, everything is tidy, broken, a mess Even the soundtrack is bad as it's just loud rocks songs !! The only good thing was the tiny, nerdy girl Sheila but she was the first to die and i didn't find interest after.

However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

I agree partially. The visuals are pretty good and surprisingly better than in ""Dream Warriors"" but they have this music video look. I have no problem with that but the Nightmare movies had a darker atmosphere, specially on death scenes. Still the visuals are pretty good; Nightmare 4 is a colorful Horror movie.The plot shows that the producers and director tried to make an intelligent Horror movie but I don't think that bringing up a new heroine was the best choice. The series focused on Freddy Krueger as the main character but this time his on-screen appearances went too far. Krueger comes up with cheesy one-liners every time he's on screen and even makes him odd.The direction is very good. Some death scenes were very creative and well done. The movie is not as dark as part 1 or 2, but still has some creepy settings.Overall, it was nice to have Kincaid, Joey, and Kirsten once again even for Freddy's revenge. After their demises the movie becomes more fantasy oriented and ends up abruptly. Still, this is a sequel to watch if you are fan of the series.

48,Anonymous_Maxine,Interesting transition.,5,28 April 2004,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Picking up not long after where Part 3 left off, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 4 has the strange transitional quality of including several characters from the last film, but pretty much just long enough for them to get killed off. Kristen is no longer played by Patricia Arquette, but by the curiously named Tuesday Knight instead, and she is now attempting to gain some semblance of a normal life. Roland Kincaid, who we remember from the last film, has started having nightmares of his own, one of which involves a scene at the junkyard where Freddy's bones were carelessly disposed of, and in which they are brought back to life. Bet you didn't see that one coming.(spoilers) So the whole thing about Freddy not being `completely killed in the last movie,' one of the biggest clichés in the episodic horror movie genre, is slightly covered over with one of the weirdest and weakest attempts at originality which I can even begin to remember in just about any genre. Kincaid has this dream about the junkyard that he first saw in the lat movie, and in this one, he watches as his dog digs up Freddy's bones and then does something that I don't think anyone could have anticipated. In that sense, at least it wasn't predictable, right? It could have been something straight out of the index like a bolt of lightning or even an earthquake to bring Freddy back to life, but no. The dog digs up his bones, and then brings them back to life. By peeing on them. And not just that, he pees FIRE onto Freddy's bones.I've been going back and watching all the Nightmare on Elm Street films as well as the Friday the 13th films because I want to refresh my memory before watching Freddy vs. Jason (and don't worry, I realize how contemptuously bad that movie simply HAS to be). One of the things that I've noticed is how much more tongue-in-cheek the Freddy movies are, how much more comic relief there is and how much more glossed over they are than the Friday films, which tend to be much more abrasive and lean more toward a painful reaction at the vicious murders. Freddy, for example, is constantly cracking stupid jokes and spouting goofy one-liners, often before gleefully ramming all of his finger-knives into a victim. Jason, on the other hand, is completely soundless. He just doesn't stop coming until he's skewered someone.
I don't think you need to have this juxtaposition of these two hugely popular horror series' to know that the Nightmare on Elm Street films progressively take themselves less and less seriously, but the dog peeing fire is certainly a signpost of the last shred of dignity that these movies ever had. The potential of the Nightmare on Elm Street films took a huge hit in Part 2, for example, when Jesse was cleaning his room, then another one in the same room with the wet towels, and yet it's telling that Part 2 was one of the better sequels. The dog peeing on the bones was, I think, the one point in the entire six-movie saga at which all credibility was lost, and the rest of this movie and the other sequels and rendered little more than tired exercises in throwing together just enough of  a plot for Freddy to come in and coast through the movie on his massive popularity. By this point in the series, Freddy has become an icon, a hero to the preteen and teen target audiences, which only disturbs me because he is the ghost of a child molester. Must there be so much effort put into making him likable?When you see that Freddy is killing off the remaining characters from the last movie, the last of the Elm Street kids, as it were, it seems strange that he makes such quick progress, but soon you realize it's because that's not the point of the movie. He can't just kill them off an no one else, that would run the risk of no room for more sequels! No, there must be new kids to kill so that more tenuous connections can be made to the original Elm Street kids and more movies can be made. It's interesting to note that if Freddy ever fulfills his revenge, he'll effectively kill himself because he'll have no more reason to exist.Freddy's new trick is to make Kristen pull all of her friends into her dreams so that he can kill them. She is reasonably safe, since she is providing Freddy with so much new teen flesh to cut up (and because she'll be needed to almost-but-not-quite kill Freddy at the end of the movie), but it's strange that she always pulls in her closest friends to be killed off. Yes, she gains some sort of power from each of them after Freddy kills them, which she uses in the final climactic scene, but it's also interesting to consider what might have happened had she dreamed of a machine gun or something. The least her friends could have done was go to sleep with a butcher knife or something.As far as the killings, the transformation from Freddy's stalking habits in the original film has evolved from subtly scary relentlessness to cartoonish exaggeration. There's a scene where he's actually on a sunny beach in this movie (which explains why so many horror movie are deliberately so badly lit, since this scene is about as scary as a Colgate commercial), there's a scene where he squishes one of his victims in a roach motel, there's even a scene where he's invisible and kung-fu fighting with one of his victims just before he kills him. What the hell is all this?There are a couple of scenes that are relatively effective, such as one where one of the characters is bench pressing and Freddy pushes the bar toward her chest until her elbows snap and break open like crab legs, but then she starts turning into a cockroach, evidently just so Freddy can kill her in the above-mentioned roach motel. I should mention that the special effects used to turn her into a cockroach were actually pretty effective, but they lead up to one of the dumber scenes in the movie. There is also an interesting scene near the end where the souls of the children that Freddy have killed tear out of his body and consume him, but it's a long haul sitting through the rest of this movie for that, and even then it's not exactly much of a payoff.It's sad how far Freddy has changed from the demonic ghost of a deranged killer with the curious ability to kill his victims in their dreams, into a wise-cracking goofball who spouts one-liners and then kills his victims, almost as though the murders are the encore. People laugh at his jokes, then cheer when he splatters someone. Even more than now, the comparisons back in 1988 to the brilliant stand-up comedian Gallagher's routine had to have been noticed. Gallagher got up there on stage, made the audience laugh with his jokes, then splattered some watermelons. Is Freddy's job by now any different?",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Well, I hate it and this movie is no exception to that. Additionally, Craven's completely absent from this thing... again.But there is still hope on the horizon. While this is, on the whole, not as atmospheric as the first and third, the story is far better than the lamoid trash we were served in the second. The camera work isn't bad here either. Some of the ideas were actually a bit enlightened, and the one-liners were well placed, few and far between. The performances in this one are really quite decent, as well.MINOR SPOILERS! However. I don't know about you, but by the third death, I'd be looking into that Freddy thing. You've got two different girls telling the same story, two kids die, the first girl dies and the second girl starts telling the first girl's story. By the third death, and definitely by the fourth, I'd be reading up on old Fred Kruger. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out these things. You go to the local library, the news paper morgue, you find everything you can on the guy and you sit down and put the pieces together.

Not every female trips and falls at the critical moment. And not all teens have the minds of children. Some are emotionally mature enough to handle a crisis. Craven never gave us ""stupid"" kids. He showed us enlightened, misunderstood fighters; survivors. Not Mensa candidates, but not victims, either. Films such as these, which lack direction and strength are bordering on the lines of exploitation films, IMO. But that is for another time.This is not the weakest link in this chain, but it is not the quality of work in the first and the third. Perhaps this series suffers an ""even curse"" as the Star Trek films suffered the ""odd curse."" We shall have to wait and see, but quite honestly, had they ended the franchise here, it would have been a decent ending. But to be honest here, this was done during the time of the big Writer's Strike of the late 80's, and for this movie to have been as good as it was, was a miracle, frankly.

When this first came out on VHS I was blown away by the special effects & it quickly became my second favourite in the franchise, after the first film. This was mainly due to the special effects (impressive at the time) and gimmicky way in which people die. However, 30 years on and in my opinion the film has lost some of that initial positivity, I know think that part 3 is a far better movie.
There were splashes of humour in part 3 but it still managed to also be a dark, scary horror film. But in Dream Warriors Freddy is now more of a comic, spouting corny one-liners, which is something that I personally wasn't so fond of. The special effects are the real star here. It's still a fun movie to watch but I think it was the point where the series started to go down hill.

58,Foreverisacastironmess123,Freddy gets reanimated by demonic dog pee!,7,25 October 2019,"So for me this was definitely the strangest Nightmare On Elm Street movie yet when I watched it recently.. Even the second one with all its 'subtextual' nonsense didn't quite go off the rails like this one does! I always found this to be a significant step down from Dream Warriors and I still don't think it's up to the standard of that movie, it has a lot of action and flash but there's no real fear factor or atmospheric substance to it, the style and attitude of everything is so in your face, it was only made a year or so after Dream Warriors but it feels like an entirely different kind of Nightmare movie, one that never quite works as well as its predecessor. For one thing there's no real story that grabs you, just a skeletal plot held together with elaborate set pieces and a lot of junk, it's Freddy fast food. All that said I do actually like the movie, it's certainly not without flair and its striking visuals do give it a distinctive feel, it's a bit more on the pop rock than creepy side of things but it is fun to watch and genuinely entertaining and works well as a trashy and incredibly 80s horror romp. I always hated when horror movies would kill off the survivors from the previous movie, it was always just a mean move that cheapens and undermines their past victory, and in this movie in particular it really smacks of getting them out of the way so they can introduce the new batch of victims, I suppose it couldn't have been avoided but I really wish they'd have devised a way to just leave Kincaid Joey and Kristen out of it entirely.. Tuesday Knight was so lame! She tried and at points she was kind of decent but she was such a poor stand-in and frankly looked downright uncomfortable in her role, and I found her so annoying every time she awkwardly yelled out ""No!"" that it was actually a bit of a relief when definitely-not-Kristen was boiled alive! I do hope that the reason Patricia Arquette didn't return was that she just knew it wouldn't be as good which it wasn't. Something I did love was Lisa Wilcox as Alice, she was beautiful and likeable and had all the best qualities that a survivor type ought to have and I found her the most fun and interesting thing about this movie, I love her arc as she goes from being all quiet and daydreaming about what she'd really like to do in her life to a full blown warrior as she became the Dream Master! To me a moment of cheesy greatness is when Alice takes down the pictures of her dead friends from the mirror and sees herself and puts on all the items that belonged to each of them and gains her own inner strength and heads out to kick Freddy's ass! I love that scene, it's pure kickass 80s excellence!!! And as for Freddy himself in this one, well there sure wasn't any mystery about him anymore by this point, we all knew who he was, and he definitely wasn't there to scare you anymore, he was there to entertain and was given centre stage as the macabre goofball, and there weren't no going back! Part 3 got the balance right between the scary and funny Freddy but this one goes way overboard with the one liners to the point that it feels like a horror comedy. I'm not saying that Robert Englund still wasn't fun to watch in action, just that a little Freddy goes a long way.. I think he looked frankly stupid in the scene that's set in broad daylight on the beach, it's kind of insulting to the character as he was never designed to be seen in the freaking sunshine by god! As far as the kills go, Debbie's is a real doozie and is both disturbing and utterly disgusting at the same time as she is slowly transformed into a bug! It's a great kill and one of the most memorably vile ones of the whole series for sure, that one always stuck in my head about this movie. So did the looping sequence that goes on around it, I find it surreal and impressively done how Alice and her sort of boyfriend both realise that Freddy's messing with them and making them go around in circles too late to save poor Debbie from getting squished! This is a good Freddy movie for what it is, it's got a great heroine, Freddy is a lot of fun, and it has its own kind of appeal and I guess I can respect that..

The problem with this is sequel is that, it has too much wisecracks from Freddy. Which he's supposed to be threatening in some ways. For the film's story, it's a good one but it is thinly plotted and could have been much better in storytelling. This is actually the biggest hit of the series (Not Critically Acclaimed).

62,aidanratesmovies,Freddy's back...again...,5,28 May 2020,"Predictable, messy, and all together illy contrived- A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is a definite weaker chapter in the franchise, and does little to contribute to it as a whole. To start off with the good, there are several interesting concepts throughout the movie. The idea of expanding the dream scenario from dream masters is a good idea, however, the execution of the fact made it seem rather pointless. There are a few cool sequences as well in the film, as well as a few interesting characters on paper, but all together very little of it matters in the long run. The film is consistently entertaining, but can often feel quite stupid, and incredibly pointless. The film contains a large amount of filler to tie its looser bits together, and serves no other purpose than to make another sequel for the franchise. It seems incredibly artificial, and at times pretty lazy, as dialogue and situations often seem poorly written and pretty mediocrely directed. The acting is very mediocre as well, with some laughable performances and acting from the actors involved. Lisa Wilcox seemed to be the only actor that was really trying, and Robert Englund seemed to be having fun with the role, but his only purpose seemed to be giving off cheesy one liners, and his presence became more annoying than creepy. In the end, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is a very weakly structured film. It is entertaining enough, but doesn't provide enough to make for any true enjoyment, or anything memorable thereafter.

64,TheOneThatYouWanted,Funny story behind this film..,8,15 May 2016,"I'm currently watching all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies I've never seen before; because Spike TV just had a Nightmare on Elm Street marathon. So after a few more Nightmare films, I can officially say I watched them all. Anyway, like I said in the title of this review, there is a funny story behind this Nightmare movie. I watched a Nightmare on Elm Street documentary a few years back and they interviewed the director for this Nightmare movie. He was laughing his ass off and told the story about how he was a no name director and they hired him to do a rush job and direct this Elm street movie because the previous one, Dream Warriors did better than expected. The studio give him a limited timeframe, a modest budget and literally a 5 page outline they told him to use as a script. The studio didn't even care if the movie was good or not, they just wanted to put out another Nightmare movie ASAP as a cash grab.. funny how things haven't changed much when it comes to the studio executive's train of thought. Anyway, the director said, ""F- it"" and he literally wrote the dialog and story as he went along. Ironically enough, what we got is considered one of the better Nightmare sequels, and I would have to agree. For a Nightmare on Elm street movie, it's great. I would rank it somewhere in the top three. And you can tell by watching the movie, 100% of it is purely from the director's natural talent. The director, Renny Harin went on to director some of the biggest action films of the 90s, and marry one of the hottest actresses of the 90s. And it was all thanks to doing a great job on a movie he could have did a halfass job on and got away with.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
65,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not as great as A nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) but can be enjoyed,6,28 February 2016,"When franchises begin going past the trilogy mark, there are only a few reasons why. Some of this is either because the series has a loyal fanbase, the series itself has likable characters or a well written narrative or it just makes a ton of money. There are also times where the reason consists of all three of these combined. A few years back, Wes Craven had created a new kind of horror that people would literally see in their dreams and his name was Freddy Krueger. The series itself up to this point had gone through a roller-coaster in quality and approval by viewers. The first is considered to be the best (which is usually the case), the second had most people scratching their head and the third had more people satisfied than before by bringing the story back to its original roots. For this entry, there are definitely parts of the script that worked as well as other components but it isn't as great a comeback as A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987). Most people would probably say this is between the second and third film.For this sequel, Renny Harlin who was a relative newbie at the time, sits in the director's chair. Writing the screenplay however was by a whole new set of people. One of which, Brian Helgeland, was their first time penning a theatrical script. Helgeland would later write for L.A. Confidential (1997), Payback (1999), Man on Fire (2004) and Legend (2015). The other two writers were Jim Wheat and Ken Wheat, who are now best known for creating Vin Diesel's Riddick role from Pitch Black (2000). The story picks up some time after the third where it seems even though the last of the Elm Street kids finished off Freddy, he's still around. Kristen Parker (now played by Tuesday Knight instead of Patricia Arquette) keeps having bad dreams and dragging Joey (Rodney Eastman) and Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) back into them. Soon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is resurrected and the fight for survival begins all over again and this time, the dream warriors bring in more characters.Joining the group is Kristen's boyfriend Rick (Andras Jones), her sister Alice (Lisa Wilcox), smarty Sheila (Toy Newkirk), muscle punk girl Debbie (Brooke Theiss) and not so cocky jock Dan (Danny Hassle). Of these group of characters (old or new), they all carry something about them that make them likable and that's appreciated. Most horror films just give teen roles the ""no crap given"" attitude but here, they aren't the typical bunch of high school teenagers. They are certainly not as magnetic as the original dream warriors but the audience can still get attached to them. Aside from characters though, not all of the script does its job. For one thing, Krueger's explanation for coming back to life feels weak and brushed over. It undoes all the effort that went into the third film but oh well. Also the continuity lacks a bit. Sure what's left of the original dream warriors are still around, but why don't they teach the new group how to fight in their dreams? Instead it all goes to Alice (aka the Dream Master).For that, it just feels extra lazy because what good is it to learn something important only to not show anyone else when needed? What's the sense in that? It's not only this but it straight up insults the intelligence of the characters from the prior entry. Surely they were smarter than this. However, that's about it for errors within this film. Even the method here of killing off Freddy is still mostly acceptable. The gore and scares to this horror film are effective most of the time too. If you've seen enough horror movies, this won't be scary but there are definitely some gross scenes that can be hard to look at. Some limbs just shouldn't bend certain ways...yuk. The special effects incorporated to make these scenes and the dream sequences work are sufficient in their purpose. There was probably only one scene an effect look blatantly pasted over an actor but that's it. The rest looks like practical effects in its glorious 1980s appeal.Steven Fierberg was the director of photography to this picture. For the shots on screen, Fierberg doesn't have a look that he gives all his own, but he does keep the scenes clear and visible to a point. He also tries to recreate the visual style of the prior movies with keeping Krueger in the shadows for a bit. Finally is the musical score composed by Craig Safan. It feels as if the Elm Street series can't seem to find a permanent composer. Thankfully, they have managed to keep the main theme concrete. Just like Angelo Badalamenti's score, Safan sticks to Charles Bernstein's memorable Nightmare cue with music box and electronic synths. Here however, the score doesn't sound AS cheap as Badalamenti's. There are times where the sound of the music feels more wholesome than the previous film. Then again, it still has that 80s quality to it as well. Safan could have also expanded the score to focus on the characters and important scenes but for now it at least keeps it simple.Most entries at this point get pretty bad, but this passage maintains some of the better quality that made A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) an entertaining sequel. The music is still creepy and the characters remain unorthodox to the usual high school teen tropes. Just don't expect any good reasoning behind Freddy's return or some decent common sense at times.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
66,Sandcooler,Freddie goes Hollywood,3,2 November 2008,"So I guess they were looking for some new angle, but then they bailed out on that and just mentioned ""dream master"" here and there pretending that was something. Either way, this really just reprises the first one and doesn't even do a very good job of that. When did Freddie Krueger get so talky anyway? His lame dialogue doesn't really match his cool everything else. How much writers does it take to figure all these one-liners suck? I guess they were all busy changing a light bulb. The Freddie character is crushed even further by the fact that he gets grotesque amounts of screen time. The original movie was about an implausibly beautiful girl next door and her friends stalked by a mysterious killer. This one is about Freddie. Freddie Freddie Freddie. The characters don't even seem to try to stay awake. They die one by one, but hey it beats feeling tired. I wish they could all just be taken down as quickly as possible. Oh another thing, these kills are lazy and bloodless. Everyone gets a taste of the glove, usually with the camera panned away. Which I suppose makes sense because dead people can't dream anymore, but still what a downer.

Alice soon realizes that Freddy is taking advantage of that unknown power to pull a new group of children into his foul domain.Apart from WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE (ANOES 7), I believe ANOES 4 is the most superior sequel in the entire franchise and I say this with zeal. Why is that? I can't help but say this film is the most imaginative, clever, and ingenious in the franchise. After all, this is the film that made the most money in the box office, but I'm not saying money equals how good a film is.The first 20 minutes of this film is quite frustrating to me. I will not spoil it, but it does an ALIEN 3 on you. As the film continued, I stopped getting angry and went along with it. To my surprise, it started to get good. Really good. I believe this sequel focuses the most on characters. It's an ensemble film where the group of teenagers mattered rather than seeing how they will die. I was rather touched in some parts of it because I was not in for some personal scenes dealing with characters and dialogue rather than a dream killer slashing up kids in creative ways.Even though the franchise is at its fourth film, it's the most creative. There are some really ingenious death scenes here, and one of it is the best in the franchise, in my opinion. You can also tell the budget is bigger because there are more visual effects and more elaborate nightmare sequences. Lisa Wilcox is a newcomer to the franchise among the cast and she does a fine job as the new heroine. Andras Jones, Danny Hassle, and Brooke Theiss are all pretty good in their role. However, Toy Newkirk has to be my favorite character in the entire franchise. She's just so lovable.I think director Renny Harlin gets a bad rap these days, but I find his movies to be entertaining. I certainly think this film is one of Harlin's better works. ANOES 4 is great because it has the most fleshed out characters in the franchise and because everything is just so well made.

74,baumer,The regression of the horror genre,6,24 January 2002,"May contain spoilers.When people think of the great horror films of the past, one name instinctively comes to mind.  A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.  This film embodied all that horror stood for and all that it should be.  Wes Craven created a character so surreal, so heartless and so deleterious to those that he haunts, that Fred Frueger became an icon in the industry.  Nightmares that could kill you? Now there is a novel idea.A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 was just sheer garbage and although  Nightmare 3 was a little better, it still continued that downward spiral that every NOES has taken since 1984.  The third sequel, while a little better, really offers nothing to assure us that this is the same franchise that scared us so thoroughly almost 20 years ago.What makes this film better than some of the others is that it has an almost passable story and it tries diligently to further the legend that is Fred Krueger.  When this film concentrates on Freddy's past, his mother's past and how he was fathered by 100 b**tard maniacs, it is actually quite intriguing.  And that only stands to reason because that is how the first one hooked you in.  It had dark alleys, lots of blood and a plethora of dead bodies but it also went to great pains to explain what was happening and why.  It was also darker and had little or no comedy.  So in part 4, we are teased with the continuation of the Krueger legend, only to disappoint us by disregarding every rule and every nuance that Krueger abided by or followed dogmatically in the first.  Just one brief example is how he dies in the film.  In the third picture, Freddy inhabits a hall of mirrors as he terrorizes Nancy and company.  In this one, he is killed because he can see his own reflection in a mirror.  Where is the linear consistency in this? Does Robert Shaye not read every script before the cameras start rolling? And can someone please explain to me how it is that a dream dog can urinate on Freddy's bones and this miraculously resurrects the child molester? Could they not think of anything more plausible than urine?
I am not sure how NOES became as cult as it did.  I am not even sure what the appeal is to everyone.  What I do know is that Freddy used to scare me. He used to do everything in his realm of hieratic existence to taunt, scare, belittle and murder you.  Now he just appears when he feels like it, tells a few jokes and then slices you in two.  And herein lies the problem.Freddy isn't scary anymore.  Freddy doesn't make you want to turn the lights on or have people over the watch the film with you.  Freddy amuses.Nightmare 3 improved on the second one and in some cases the fourth backtracks to it's roots and infuses the Krueger legend with some new angles.  It's just too bad the film can't stay on that path and finish that way.  As it stands, this really isn't much of a film and I only recommend watching it just to remind you how good we really had it when Wes Craven was writing and directing a film that would delight all the horror film purists.

76,mentalcritic,Nightmare On Elm Street Lite,1,22 September 2004,"As horror film franchises moved into the late 1980s, the clamp-down that the MPAA inflicted upon Hollywood was biting hard. Films were going into theatrical release with much of the content that their budget was spent on missing. Some filmmakers defiantly thumbed their nose at the MPAA by manipulating the system, while the makers of A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 simply neutered their film in advance. Either way, once this virtually bloodless film was compared with its three predecessors, it's no wonder that fans basically ignored it.To understand why the makers of part seven basically pretended that this and the two films after it never happened, one has to think about what a film buff wants to see when they go to see a film like this. Maybe one can tone down the sex and drugs, or make the atmosphere more pastel than dark, but once the blood or detailed kills are removed, every reason your core audience has for watching goes with them.Adding insult to injury is a major change in the Freddy character. Parts one and two kept him in the shadows, expressing himself through an economy of words. Part three put him in front of the camera more, but kept him grotesque enough that his quips added interest. Here, it would only take a few modifications to make Freddy into something one would hold in their arm when they curl up to sleep. During half the film, I was half expecting the rest of the cast to break into song about how he's just misunderstood.The acting quotient is severely diminished here, too. Robert Englund dutifully does his best with lousy dialogue, but even his hamming it up cannot disguise his lack of enthusiasm. As he is puking out dialogue that David Bowie would have refused during Labyrinth, one can sense he longs to go back to miniseries like V. Ken Sagoes and Rodney Eastman dutifully return from the previous episode, but given how subdued this one is by comparison, they cannot compensate for their lack of talent by overacting here. Patricia Arquette felt that pieces of junk like Time Out and Far North were more worthy of her time, and given that she's appeared in films recently, I think she's made the right choice. She is replaced here by the unfortunately named Tuesday Knight. As an actor, she makes one hell of a waitress, I'm sure.This was Renny Harlin's first high-profile production. It pretty much set the entire tone for his career, with production after production based on a shaky premise and bad script. You know a director is cursed when Die Hard 2 is the most high-brow entry on his resumé. Honestly, has this man ever directed something that doesn't resemble an extended music video?In all, I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 a one out of ten. When you're in a conversation with anyone regarding a piece of garbage that sells out to the lowest common denominator and they try to tell you that there's nothing wrong with ""appealing to a broader audience"", tell them they obviously haven't seen this film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Altogether, this is no clunker, but next to ""Nightmare 5"" this is the weakest in the series.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

No real chills to speak of, but astounding visuals with dazzling special effects are the main course here, and served with panache. Renny Harlin directs with a sure hand, the script (with some loopholes admittedly) is mostly well written and performances are generally good. Freddy is more like a hero here than the truly scary villain he was in the original, and I actually found myself cheering him on in some instances. His one liners are very amusing and Robert Englund is good as always.All in all, this is one spectacular showcase that entertains, but doesn't really frighten.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
80,CursedChico,Starts strong.,7,2 April 2021,"Starts strong.Again showing college life, kids. Some has cars. In the intro scenes.The opening song, nightmare belongs to tuesday knight who played as kristen and was replaced to Patricia Arquette from previous movie. I wish they did not replaceSo from previous movie, Fourth Dream warrior has died it seems. The woman who could fight in dreams. It is sad.They scared the dog too much while freddy was reviving. It is bad.Freddy revived and it was an astonishing scene! Such things.And he starts revenge. Second movie name was revenge but this movie is the revenge in fact :)Again, freddy used sexuality to get joey. Joey again did same mistake.""Wet dream, ha"" said freddy. Dark humor again.Kristen told other dream warriors about freddy but they did not believe and they died after a while. The movie is always like that. If you don't believe in your friend, you get killed :) and then while they were attacked by freddy, they asked kristen to help but it was too late.And as i remember, only in first movie, freddy made extraordinary killings. I mean which other people saw as extraordinary because freddy was hiding somehow the clues which could be understood it was killed by non-human things. In first movie, there was a death like that, which caused blood waterfall. Here, joey was killed like that. But still no-one understands. Or questions .And this time freddy predicted future, or kristen? The nurse said just same which kristen had as dream just before:
feeling better now?what happenedyou have quite bump.And this time, kristen's friends are supportive. Boyfriend rick says he will help her. And alice and dan seems believed in her. But again mother is same and made her killed. Made her sleep.With sunglasses , freddy was cool :) While in the beach to get kristen.The house is empty in the elm street. NOone probably wants to stay there. They all know about the curse.And again, noone questioned how joey was in a pool in his bed. Maybe police cia etc hided it:) i am not sure. Or noone understands why two friends died in same night. I think we need to discard such things in this series.Rick was also killed , while alice shot and glasses were broken at same time but noone suspects anything :) absurdism.SO last kid of elm street's, kristen was killed by freddy and was buried to same cemetery of nancy and his father's. It was sad to see all dead.There was a doctor from previous movie, from clinic. I thought we could see him, but he did not appear.In this series, you can't see a character more than 2 movies, it is like rule, except freddy :)And after kristen was gone, they again stopped believing but then again started to believe in alice but it was too late.So, freddy only can go to dreams of elm street kids. I did not know that rule. Last kid was gone so freddy needs alice to take them into dream. Freddy needed alice, why did he almost kill alice in the end? If he managed to kill alice, how could he reach other kids' dream?And when freddy saw himself in the mirror, prophecy became true :) Freddy is so weak to stop this thing.Kristen did not have ability to absorb abilities as far i know/remember. But alice can do. Rick's fighting skill for example. It was good to see karate culture :)Debbie has really cool hair from the beginning of the movie :)While debbie was working out, how did she sleep, it was different and how did freddy put them into loop? It was first time such thing.And alice was sleeping when she jumped into mirror or imagination which she was doing? It was cool. Cool scenes started after that. Last 25-30 minutes especially. The singing kids in whites for example.Last minutes were nice. Dark scenes while souls are trying to escape from freddy's body.It seems he did not die , again. In pool, reflection was shown of him. And alice will die in next movies as we guess :)In the end, i waited again absurdism just like in 1 and 2. Movies. Freddy's come back and kill them but it did not happen just like in third Movie.This movie is not better than the third movie but good.The closing theme song was nice. First time i think they made a song like this. Freddy's laugh. I think it was by the fat boys, the band.I like the movie. I enjoyed watching. I can see next movie i hope soon.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
81,fmarkland32,Master of a disaster...,3,1 August 2006,"This time Freddy returns thanks to a dog who couldn't find a hydrant, to this time wipe out the original kids on Elm Street and the new ones who currently dwell on that god forsaken street. (Why do these people keep buying houses there?) However this time Freddy meets his match against ""The Dream Master"" who can manipulate her dreams. I remember seeing # 3 and saying that if I could have a dream power to take out Freddy I'd be an expert in martial arts of course back when you're 13 you often talk about the dumbest thing with your friends, so then the next year when Nightmare # 4 came out there was indeed a martial artist but the potential for such a sequence goes unrealized, that aside the movie is too tongue in cheek. Freddy has lost all of his edge and the killings have gone from surreal and suspenseful to just plain silly. Indeed the movie knows that because of the pop culture phenomenon that the public stopped buying into Freddy as being genuinely scary (That is unless you are 7 years old) and so they just try to make it comic. I for one wasn't buying and given the rating neither was anyone else. However there are a couple inspired moments, as I said the climax is fun and there is an amusing sequence with pizza but because the movie is now written strictly to genre formula we basically sit and watch as teenagers get slaughtered one by one. The only suspense being not whether various characters will die but how. In other words it became repetitive and dull.*1/2 out 4-(Poor)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
82,ivo-cobra8,The best slasher sequel since the original film in A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise!,10,28 March 2016,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) It is one of my personal favorite horror movies with the original A Nightmare on Elm Street film, it is solid, decent, excellent horror slasher sequel in A Nightmare on Elm Street series franchise. I love this movie to death and my favorite heroine is Alice Johnson. This flick is Better than part 2,5,6 and the horrible awful remake that I hate to death! We have a new heroine named Alice, which is awesome. Lisa Wilcox is a bad ass in this flick, wondering what happened to that actress. Lisa Wilcox did an excellent job as shy heroine Alice. Tuesday Knight blow my heart away she was the heart and the soul of this movie. She wrote performed the theme song Nightmare for this film. This film is actually my Renny Harlin's favorite movie alongside Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2 and Deep Blue Sea. Renny Harlin did a great job with direction and visuals of the film, I think it's actually some of the best directing work he did, and Lisa Wilcox's character Alice is probably to Freddy what Tommy Jarvis is to Jason, an enemy that he will always fight but he will always lose. This film has a lot of good soundtracks that I love. It has an excellent cast that I love. Wes Craven's a Nightmare on Elm Street will be my number 1 while this one will be my number 5. Plot: Freddy Krueger returns once again to terrorize the dreams of the remaining Dream Warriors, as well as those of a young woman who may know the way to defeat him for good.Before I start what I like about this movie, I love Wes Craven's original film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) which is my favorite best horror slasher film. My third favorite film of the series is Wes Craven's last movie New Nightmare (1994) which is my third favorite film in A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise and I think is the third best film. Things I Love in this movie: I like the music scores by John Easdale and Craig Safan, they are a lot of music tracks that are put in the film from the 80's. I love Tuesday Knight's song Nightmare she played it during opening credits. I love Tuesday Knight and Lisa Wilcox's acting performance both of the leads did an outstanding job as acting her characters. Lisa Wilcox was a bad ass in this film, her character as Alice Johnson was well written, she was decent and the only heroine that she never died in the film series. Tuesday Knight as Kristen Parker was decent and she was awesome, she was better than Patricia Arquette I love movies from the 80's action and horror films that I love, so this is pretty solid good movie, far way better than 5 and remake which I think they are the worst one I have ever saw. I like that this movie is fantasy and it has a good kills and Freddy is trying still to be scary. Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight) was actually a Dream Warrior she had a power to call her friends in her dreams, Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) was a Dream Master and she gave her power to Freddy, of course Kristen was the last Elms Street child, but Freddy need it new ones to get the souls from the children to become more powerful than ever. I like the boiler room scene Kristen eventually finds herself in Freddy's boiler room. It is explained that Kristen is the last child from Elm Street, and Freddy needs her help to get more children. I like that is that explanation. I like the last fight between Alice and Freddy, Alice change her self in to an bad ass heroine she fight's Freddy defeats him with a mirror of his own image and she releases all souls of the children that Freddy took them away. I love that Alice saves Dan Jordan (Danny Hassle) from death. Brooke Theiss as Debbie Stevens was beautiful, gorgeous and hot I love her in this film. Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) and Joey Peterson (Rodney Eastman) both returned from previous installment The Dreams Warriors and they were both killed off in the beginning of the film which is stupid. I really don't like this, the characters who survived in previous installment been killed off. It feel's to me like Nancy's effort keeping them save was for nothing. That's the only problem I have with this film. A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is a 1988 American slasher horror film and the fourth film in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, stars Robert Englund, Lisa Wilcox and Danny Hassle.Overral: I enjoy this film every time I see it and I have fun with it, goes very fast around it is fast paced and entertaining. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
83,fernandoschiavi,"This fourth episode shows many repetitions, but hits the cold atmosphere and the seriousness of the production",5,25 September 2021,"Horror icon Freddy Krueger had already established himself in the gallery of the great monsters of modern cinema alongside Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Leatherface and Pinhead, acquiring a unique characteristic until then: he was the most sarcastic character in the genre, always with amusing phrases as he leads his victims to a real death through dreams. In A Hora do Nightmare 4, his characteristic humor is more in tune, with the character appearing in costumes and playing with the way he eliminates young people. Following the public and critical success of Dream Warriors, New Line has already rushed production for the fourth chapter of A Nightmare on Elm Street. The former had already established elements that would now become the norm in the franchise: elaborate mega elaborate deaths, Freddy with a sense of humor and more details about his origins. With this, The Master of Dreams leverages the ingredients, even though it doesn't reach the same level as its previous one.Despite being buried on holy ground in Nightmare Hour 3: Warriors of the Dreams, Freddy Krueger found a way to return to revenge his tormentors Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), Joey (Rodney Eastman) and Kristen (Tuesday Knight replacing Patricia Arquette, pregnant during filming). He returns during a nightmare involving a junkyard, where the dog Jason (there is irony!) decides to urinate a flame (!!!), which ends up rebuilding the murderer's corpse. Kristen tells her friends about Freddy's return, but her fate was already set when her mother decided to give her sleeping pills.Considered the last descendant of the young, children of parents who burned the killer alive, just before she died, Kristen uses her power to lead people to dreams and takes her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox, from The Intruders), sister of her boyfriend Rick (Andras Jones), transferring this ability to the girl. Thus, Freddy starts using the new conductor to attract other young people to his laminated glove, such as the affair between Alice, Dan (Danny Hassel), her friend Sheila (Toy Newkirk) and the cockroach-woman Debbie (Brooke Theiss), with the most interesting and painful death of the long one.Every young woman who succumbs to an encounter with Freddy transmits his power to Alice. Thus, the boy Karate Kid fan, Rick, allows her to be skilled to fight, while Sheila makes her nerdier. In one of the funniest flaws in the film, Alice decides to show her ability to use a tchaco, but it is clear that when the scene is shown from behind it is a man with a wig unrelated to the actress' hair. In addition to these acquired gifts, Alice is aware that the true master of dreams is the one who can not only face her nightmares, but also direct and direct them. Whether in the teacher's phrase, in a class on Aristotle, or in the research she does, she realizes that facing her fear may be the only way to overcome it. For that, it will be necessary to go to the enemy for a combat in its own universe, using the powers and mainly its confidence.As of this film, A Hora do Nightmare becomes more interested in the way it kills its characters than in the story itself. Okay, the screenplay by Brian Helgeland, Jim Wheat and Ken Wheat (the latter two under the pseudonym Scott Pierce) even tries to explore a little more of Krueger's past and the mysterious figure of Nun Nan, but it also makes us swallow ideas like the fact that a dog urinates a jet of fire and resurrects Krueger. It doesn't stop working as unpretentious trash fun, but it's a distinct drop from the level reached by the third film, which had a strong plot and understood the fine line between exaggeration and camp.But if there's one element that doesn't really disappoint, it's the work of the makeup and special effects department. As we see it, we have pearls like a ""planet"" made up of a gigantic junkyard, a waterbed that turns into the worst wet dream in history and, of course, the fascinating sequence in which Freddy turns a young girl into a cockroach, something that would certainly make Kafka very proud. Renny Harlin's direction is also inventive, from the delicacy of the opening credits to the scene in which the protagonist is sucked into a movie screen, finding there an enveloping ghost town.Nightmare on Elm Street 4 demonstrates the fatigue of the franchise, with repetitions of oneiric scenes and deaths (the children's lullaby, the death of the boy pulled into the bed...), but it hits the cold atmosphere and the seriousness of the production. Despite Freddy's humor, we still have the feeling that this is a horror feature and not a killer stand up. With this third sequence, I would finish the acceptable copies of the series, with an average note. Afterwards, only the seventh film would rescue the character's creativity, using him as a self-reference.Nightmare on Elm Street 4 was supposed to be the end of the franchise, as the descendants of Elm Street were dead, but Freddy Krueger wanted more and would return for new encounters with young people in their nightmares until a confrontation with Jason and an unnecessary remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
84,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not without it's flaws, Dream Master is a worthwhile 4th entry",8,25 October 2020,"After the events of Dream Warriors, Kristen continues to have nightmares of Freddy's house, afraid that Freddy would come back. Upon making friends at high school including Alice played by Lisa Wilcox, one of the Dream Warriors named Kincaid dreams of the junkyard where Freddy's remains were buried and Freddy Krueger is brought back to life. After learning about Elm Street from Kristen, Alice and the others have to find a way to defeat him.It's very hard to make a sequel that would live up to the original film. Sometimes there are some that are just as good, while others tend to be either terrible or disappointing. With the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, the sequels have been hit and miss with Dream Warriors and New Nightmare being better entries (Dream Warriors being the best notably) and Dream Child and Freddy's Dead being the weaker entries. Dream Master isn't a perfect sequel, but it's also one of the better entries.Now there are some flaws in this movie. The story's premise feels fresh and imaginative thanks the direction from Renny Harlin (known for directing Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, and the box office flop Cutthroat Island), and there are some creative set pieces, but unfortunately, it lacks the spark that made Dream Warriors much better and it does get silly at places. Much of the acting isn't that good with Tuesday Knight being terrible mis-casted as Kristen Parker and I really miss Patricia Arquette.Everything else is handled very well. While the rest of the acting isn't good, there are two exceptions. Robert Englund continues to impress and terrify as the iconic Freddy Krueger and his one-liners have wit while Lisa Wilcox makes for an appealing character in Alice. The production design is so good and makes for some creative set pieces to an otherwise silly story most notably the climax which is the best out of any Nightmare on Elm Street film. The music score is haunting and fits the atmosphere and tone of the film very well. The direction from Renny Harlin is great and does something fresh and imaginative.Overall, Dream Master isn't exactly a perfect sequel, but it's a worthwhile entry to those who love the original film and Dream Warriors.

The new bunch of characters aren't anything special, it's the quippy and gory antics of the gloved one that reach their peak.

86,Superunknovvn,Freddy's falling from grace,5,24 September 2005,"I love the ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" franchise, I really do. I enjoy it for its originality and if for nothing else its typically 80's cheese factor. Still, I will never forgive the makers of sequels 2, 4, 5, 6, even 3 and 7 for taking one of the greatest horror stories ever told and turning it into something so laughable. With Part IV Freddy Krueger was more of an antihero for the MTV generation than ever before. What was then hip is now ridiculous and director Renny Harlin's endeavor to make the movie as stylish as possible certainly doesn't make this entry in the series any spookier.The first 5 minutes of part IV alone show everything that's wrong about the movie. An awful rock song sung by Tuesday Knight (who replaces Patricia Arquette as Kristen) plays over a little girl drawing something. The camera pans away and we see it's a painting of Freddy's house on Elm Street. Kirsten approaches and asks the girl where Freddy was. The girl replies that Freddy wasn't in, then laughs hysterically and disappears. Why? No one knows. Kristen goes inside the house. Why? No idea, but the camera follows her with such an amateurish movement it's the first time this movie is unintentionally funny. Inside the house Kristen jumps because she sees a shadow of something that appears to be a claw on the wall. When she takes a closer look, though, it turns out that this was just an illusion created by a branch that looks NOTHING like the shadow. Anyway, the next thing we see is Kirsten getting blown from one room into the other. Why? Don't ask, there's no answer.It goes on like this and you just turn off your brain, because it's obvious that this movie doesn't try for one second to make any sense. It's hard to believe that an audience ever watched this without feeling cheated. However, Freddy Krueger's fame was at its height in 1988 and nothing could stop this movie from becoming the most successful installment of the Nightmare series. Not the shallow and unbelievable characters, nor the bad acting (except for the ever so wonderful Robert Englund, that is) or the non-existent story.The nudity, the bad one-liners and the often imaginative kills still get a chuckle out of me now and then and, as I've said, I still enjoy watching the movie every once in a while, but like most of the ""Nightmare"" sequels, this one is just nowhere near as good as it could and should have been.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
87,Movie-Misfit,A Lot Of Fun That Goes Beyond!,7,30 October 2019,"The Dream Master is a sequel of sorts to 1987's Dream Warriors - as well as being the 3rd sequel in the series. Directed by Renny Harlin (who I'm not a huge fan off to be honest), this action packed horror is full of comedy, style and great fx.It's obvious from his early days (between this and Arctic Heat) and the fact that he is now working from China - that Harlin is a long time fan of Hong Kong cinema. His imagery and style of shooting mimics that of the finest 80's Hong Kong films and if every cast member was Chinese, Dream Master could easily be mistaken for a classic from the HK golden years!It's a shame that experimental and exciting technique is now gone and he has resorted to typical Hollywood style filmmaking (such as the God awful Skiptrace)...The cinematography and colours are pretty cool and remind me of classics such as A Chinese Ghost Story etc, not to mention the mad mix of genres, (kung fu) fight action, and some pretty decent stunt work!Patricia Arquette has been replaced with Tuesday Knight, but the cute Joey returns as does motormouth Kinkaid - but not for long.To most people, this is pretty much more of the same Freddy versus the kids, but it's actually pretty smart extending (what was their best film so far with) Dream Warriors and in turn, produce the highest grossing film of the series as a result.A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 is a lot of fun!

89,acidburn-10,The scares take a back seat to the visuals,7,26 June 2015,"While many say that part 2 was weak, but at least it kept to the creepy and eerie tone of the first one. As we now come to the 4th part in the Freddy saga, this was where things started to go downhill from here. Not to say that this was bad, in fact this did have a lot going for it, and still boasted decent special effects, some effective and inventive death scenes.But this is also where Freddy became a pop culture icon and stopped being scary and became more fun. Also this was an obvious rush attempt after part 3 became so successful and there really should have been more time spent on plot and certain ideas could have been used. Okay it at least carries on the timeline, set just after the last one with the 3 remaining survivors coming back, but they are killed so quickly, that it just seemed pointless and the original Kristen didn't come back, played by Tuesday Knight, who isn't quite up to the job as Patricia Arquette. Also the way Freddy comes back isn't explained at all, we just get a crude dog pissing fire. But there are some elements that work though, again the dream sequences are outlandish and adventurous, sparking some impressive visuals with bright colours, but sadly loses its suspense and creepiness, and also ends up becoming very silly in parts. The viewer should have eased into them, instead of having everything happen all at once.The idea of the Dream Master element is rather interesting, but doesn't make any sense and this is where the series starts to lose its intelligence. One example of this being rushed was the guy fighting the invisible Freddy, which was just honestly very lazy and lacked any creativity whatsoever. But other moment's standout such as the girl turning into a cockroach, which was gross and brilliantly done, and looked very realistic and also the final showdown was a very epic moment and does satisfy on the whole.The cast were okay this time round, but weren't fully fleshed out like in the previous films, it seemed all the focus went on Freddy and the visuals, instead of the new teen cast. Tuesday Knight , like I said wasn't nowhere near as great as Patricia Arquette was, but she did try her best and did put effort into her role and the whole she was okay. It was great seeing Joey and Kincaid again, but they weren't given anything to do, but be killed off in the first 15 minutes, which was sad, but great seeing them again though. Lisa Wilcox as the new heroine Alice was very decent and was one of the only cast members to give a well rounded performance, and she did get better and better as the movie went on. Andras Jones was decent as the brother Rick, but again wasn't as fully formed or as interesting as he should have been, due to the script. Danny Hassal wasn't given much to do and didn't really stand out, just seemed to be there for plot convenience and came off rather bland and forgettable. Brooke Thiess was good as tough girl Debbie, but wasn't given enough screen time. Then of course as always Freddy again steals the show, Robert Englund was truly excellent and charismatic as always.All in all despite the many flaws, this never got boring once, it's still an enjoyable popcorn flick and okay it fails to scare, but at least there's always something to keep you interested, despite the weak script, I would still rank this as a decent overall Nightmare On Elm Street movie, nowhere near as great as 1 and 3, but still better than part 2.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
90,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Well it ain't Doctor Seuss""",7,1 July 2019,A sequel to the highest grossing Nightmare movie part 3 Dream Warriors this movie attempts to carry on the Freddy craze of the 80s but fails to do so as the script turns Freddy into a more horror comedy character than the terrifying monster he is well known for in the previous films replacing blood and gory kills with mainly quick and uninventive kills with snappy one liners from Freddy many fans of the nightmare series consider part 4 to be the downfall of the Nightmare series.The movie starts by following returning character Kristen played this time by (Tuesday Knight) and two other survivors from part 3 as they begin to have nightmares again and fear that Freddy may return Kristen now older and having a boyfriend who's sister Alice (Lisa Willcox) is her best friend warns those close to her that Freddy is coming back and now she is the last of the Elm Street children she is his only connection to the other children and with her power to bring people in her dreams what plans does he have in store for her and her friends.While not the best of the nightmare series this movie has its moments some funny one liners from Freddy a few decent kills but sadly the movie is just a bit predictable and the characters we are meant to root for are so one dimensional with character traits that define there entire personalities the good looking jock the nerdy girl the fitness freak all are written like they have only one defining feature and are purely there to up the body count.The effects music and makeup are good I will say that much about it and I recommend this movie to any Horror/Slasher movie fan just don't expect the best Freddy movie going in.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

The main character believes that he would be back to extract revenge but the other two think otherwise. Turns out, so obvious, that she's right and the African-American guy's dog awakens Freddy. The boy keeps cussing and dodging Freddie until he meets his end in the beginning of the movie. The other boy dies in a pool of bloody water where he is stabbed and drowned. Where are the scares guys? I have read so many reviews praising Freddie and entitling him as the ""King of Chills""! I found Rosemary's baby scarier than this.Then comes the main character's demise. But wait. Before she dies, she introduces her best friend to Freddie's world. Poor girl, one would think, but with all the atrocious acting, you wish all were dead. And this becomes a chain when the calm, mature (yeah right!) girl gets all her friends to her world. Why not get all her enemies to Freddie instead? One by one, characters keep dying in hilarious manners. Of course, no panic or safety measures in the college at all. Death is regular, right? So what if five or six kids are dead in a week? Anyway, characters are suffocated, converted into cockroaches, KO'ed and what not. The karate scene, both with the boy and the girl were cringe worthy. And this is where the main problem lies. NOES 1 and NOES 2 weren't very cringe worthy. But this takes the cake for being a very silly sequel that is best for the brainless people, literally.

However one night, Kincaid is dreaming that he's in the junkyard where Freddy was buried in the last film as his dog somehow resurrects Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) back. Kristen with friends Alice (Lisa Cox), Debbie (Brook Theiss), Danny (Danny Hassle) and Rick (Andreas Jones) have been getting bad dreams as well as soon some of them drop like flies with Alice being a pawn in Freddy's game as when some of her friends die she gains some of their powers as she is the only one to take on Freddy with them.A smart and nifty entry of the popular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" horror fantasy franchise is a solid one. After the brilliant ""Dream Warriors"", this became the highest grossing sequel in the franchise thanks to Renny Harlin's direction whom was fresh off making ""Prison"" (1988) at the same year. Centerfold Hope-Marie Carlton and b-movie beauty Linnea Quigley does some amusing cameos here in this movie, the special effects in this entry are incredible even by today's standards. There is some good acting and creative gory death scenes like the disturbing girl turning into a bug sequence or the Pizza of souls scene, Lisa Wilcox and Tuesday Knight are really smokin' hot girls in this movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
95,LoneWolfAndCub,Almost as bad as Freddy's Revenge,3,15 August 2006,"Usually I'm OK for a cheesy 80's horror movie. But this was just too awful to be enjoyed. Everything from the terrible acting to the crappy soundtrack really made this movie un-enjoyable. The only thing that saves it are some inventive deaths and, of course, Robert Englund's great performance as Freddy.This film's plot is really all over the place and is never given enough time to fully develop. We start off re-introduced to our surviving Dream Warriors: Kristen (not Patricia Arquette but Tuesday Knight, who is God-awful), Kincaid and Joey. They are still afraid of Freddy, although he is ""dead."" Alas, he is resurrected, somehow, by a dog urinating fire onto his grave. From here on, it's basically one death after another.This fourth installment in the NOES is not a pretty one. The way Freddy gets resurrected is confusing, unintentionally funny and kind of embarrassing. The acting is below par, even for an 80's slasher. The music is dreadful as is the writing. The only redeemable quality is the inventive and sometimes disgusting deaths.1½/5.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
96,statuskuo,Surpasses The First One,7,12 July 2021,"Yeah, I know...I'll be controversial and say, this movie pretty much surpasses numero uno.Yes, I said it.Because, honestly, it's better made. It shines in cinematic language. Has incredible production value for a scant budget. And really taps into the dreams and...sometimes how to control them.Prior to that, Freddy Krueger tends to be dull.It's not the fault of Wes Craven, Jack Sholder or Chuck Russell...it's just that at their point of the series, svengali Robert Shaye tended to stick his opinion in places he knows nothing about.Here Renny Harlin gets it. It's a fanboy movie made by a fanboy.I understand Wes Craven started the franchise. And had a great concept. But much like George Lucas, great ideas are one thing, executing into cinema is another.Technically speaking, this is the best one of the bunch.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

My second favorite is third part, but really close this one.First, I really love they carry on with the story of the third movie with some of the original crew. Pretty cool. Second, Fx's here are amazing, even in 2021 does not look cheap like the actual CGI wave in Hollywood.So, overall a great 80's slasher and one of the best of the movie series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
98,baileycrawly,It could've been better,6,26 October 2019,"I said in my ""Dream Warriors"" review that there was a cast of characters introduced in the film that expanded it from a series of really good horror films to a franchise, a universe, if you will. What they did with said universe beyond Elm Street III, however, isn't what I would've expected.
The special effects in this film are pretty good for the time, and it's an entertaining enough film, but it just doesn't hold up to the enjoyment that the first 3 had.
Freddy falls victim to demystification as a result of overexposure to the point where the jokes he makes have stopped being funny or really entertaining in the span of a single film.
Overall, it's definitely still a watchable movie, but it's far from the greatest entry in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
99,emperor_bender,...and the series came falling down,6,19 February 2008,"This movie marks the beginning of the decline of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I can't explain it...but this movie bored me a little. It had Freddy, Joey, and Kincaid and some pretty interesting new characters...but still failed a little. Kristen is played by Tuesday Knight here, that could be one reason it just didn't feel the same. Another reason could be that this movie returns to the format of the first movie, kids being killed off throughout the neighborhood and town...etc. Nothing more really. Some characters were OK, others I just wished would die and get off the screen. Still, this wasn't the worst of the series. 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
100,Gafke,Very Good Entry,8,8 December 2005,"Several years have passed since Kristen Parker last faced Freddy Krueger. Now she's a high schooler with a terrible premonition; her dreams about the abandoned house on Elm Street are a warning: Freddy is coming back. When her friends Joey and Kincaid are killed, Kristen is sure she's the last Elm Street victim. But when Freddy comes for her, Kristen has just enough time before she dies to pass her ability to pull people into her dreams onto her best friend Alice. Alice quickly becomes the unwilling tool of Freddy, as he uses her to get to her friends and kill them, even her own brother. But as her friends die, Alice finds she is absorbing their strengths, even as Freddy is absorbing their souls. Alice determines to use the powers she has inherited to battle Freddy and release the souls of her friends once and for all. But though Alice has become the Dream Master, Freddy is still the Nightmare King and he's not giving up without a fight.I really liked this fourth sequel, particularly because Alice as played by Lisa Wilcox is such a likable character. She's sweet, innocent and even a little dumpy, verbally abused by her father and left with virtually no self esteem whatsoever. As the film progresses, she slowly transforms into a confident and cool young woman, proving herself a worthy adversary for Freddy. I suspected Freddy of having a thing for Alice, quite frankly; she compliments him perfectly. It's really no wonder he followed her into the fifth film and got a little more lecherous along the way. Robert Englund too is really inhabiting Freddy by this point, giving him more depth and a more well defined streak of twisted nastiness. The scene in which he literally ""sucks"" a girl to death with an eager kiss makes for very uncomfortable viewing, and the ""roach motel"" sequence is just really icky. The storyline is strong, the special effects are great and the acting, for the most part, is very good. It even has a cool soundtrack which dated better than most movie soundtracks do. This and the third film are the best in the series, after the original of course.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
101,skybrick736,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master,4,30 October 2011,"I can give credit to ANOES: Dream Master for being continuous after a good movie in The Dream Warriors. The Dream Master brings some old faces like Kincade, Joey, and Kristen (even though Arquette doesn't play the part) along with a new cast that has to fight in their nightmares once again. The new supporting cast however is very weak and didn't bring anything exciting to the table. The story had some interesting parts but overall lacked a main adult lead and good dream sequences. Some of the one liners were not pulled off at all and the dialog was overall pretty lame. Freddy did have some snappy comebacks but England isn't much of a scary figure now. Sidenote is I love that all the parents who killed Krueger to begin with are all jerks or drunks in every single movie. Dream Master is definitely worth a watch that has its moments but like I said before, it was kind of flat.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
102,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,6,8 December 2004,"Vastly inferior to parts 1 and 3, better than 2, 5, and 6, part 4 should have been the end of the trilogy(1,3,4, leaving out part 2). Unfortunately, it seems very rushed and lacks the scars and ideas of its prequels. Patricia Arquette opts not to return as the main survivor of part 3, and her character as well as the other survivors are quickly dispatched without glory. Freddy is back, and is moving on to a new set of kids. These kids are far less likable than any previous ones, and we don't care if they are killed or not, with the exception of the lead heroine. The effects are over the top, and more thought has been put into the kids' deaths rather than their lives.The acting is OK, with only Englund shining, and proving that the series now belongs to him, and he is the hero. His whole part is reduced to one liners, and there is little fear left. Harlin tries his best with the script, and would go on to better things, but as always, with more though and commitment, this could have been better.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
103,theshadow908,Really bad.,3,23 June 2006,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 picks up right after 3. Freddy returns to kill the 3 remaining Dream Warriors, and to terrorize the dreams of a new young woman named Alice. The same old plot line ensues as Alice must fight Freddy to prevent her death. This movie is where the series starts to get really weird, and it's also starting to get a bit tiring.I can't really say much for this movie. The writing, the acting, and the entire story are just terrible. This movie attempts to stay on the same story line from the 3rd film, but the style changes too much. No longer is Freddy Krueger a creepy dream killer. Now he's a villain who provides his own comic relief by making every word out of his mouth a wise crack of some sort. The gore in this movie is way too far as well. It seems that the killings were meant to repulse you rather than scare you.Kristen Parker, the character from the 3rd film, is in this. Unfortunately, Patricia Arquette didn't take the role, and some no name actress took it instead. The acting in this movie is really bad.Overall, this is not a good entry into the series, so steer clear.3/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
104,room102,So-so,5,9 October 2015,"Well, it's not awful, but it's not good either. Acting is pretty bad, especially the lead actress. Most of the nightmare effects aren't as good as in Part 3 and some of them seems like a rehash of part 3 (attack in bed, attack with needles involved, Freddy shows the souls of the children) as do some of the elements in the plot. Freddy is more comical. Plot is pretty dull. The final fight feels like something from ""Mortal Kombat"", although Freddy's death sequence by Steve Johnson is pretty well done. Magical Media Industries also did some good work with the horror pizza sequence.Sequels ranking: 3>4>2>7>6>5",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
105,bh_tafe3,The King of Comedy,6,4 February 2009,"This was the first Nightmare on Elm Street I actually saw. I was 9 years old, Collingwood had just own their first premiership in 32 years. It was giddy times for a young man. And I saw this and was hooked straight away on the Freddy Krueger character.I thought I must have got something wrong with my understanding of who Freddy Krueger was. He was not scary as I thought he would be, he was funny. He was hip. Freddy Krueger, in the late 80s early 90s was cutting edge.I had no idea at the time that Part IV was the first film in the Elm Street series to take that slant on the Freddy character. Krueger had gone from being a fear inspiring creature of evil to a pop icon with this one movie.And really why wouldn't he mellow out? He'd killed off that police chief, his wife and his daughter, who'd caused the trouble in the first place, he'd killed the final three dream warriors and had his own TV show. It doesn't get any better than that. He'd even got a new weird nick name ""The bastard son of a hundred maniacs."" This was awesome stuff.Looking back now, the film has a lot of holes in it. The script was being written as the film was made, the ending made little sense. THe poem the entire conclusion was based around was hokey nonsense and the death scene, while brilliantly produced and filmed, was a real let down. All she needed to do the whole movie was stand Freddy in front of a mirror? But who cares? This is fun. Tne story here is that the three surviving characters from Dream Warriors; Kristen, Roland and Joey are in school and leading happy lives, until Freddy comes from the dead again. Now Kristen's best friend Alice (played well by Lisa Wilcox) is a dream master, she can control her dreams and inherits Kristen's gift of drawing others into her dream as Kristen is killed.But this unwittingly makes Alice a very good source of fresh victims for Freddy and she draws her friends into her dreams for Freddy to kill. As they die, she inherits their various personality traits and skills and eventually goes into dreamland for a final confrontation.This is a fun, well produced movie with an average script, decent acting and quality special effects.There is nudity, but no sex I can remember. Nice movie, worth a look today. Lots of fun and plenty of silliness.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
106,buckikris,"A Showdown With The Dream Master, Becomes A Nightmare For Freddie Kruger.",8,10 November 2019,"His is the fourth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street. I was surprised, because this is another great sequel. It is a movie that includes horror and some comedic relief The movie picks up right after Dream Warriors. The last kids of Elm Street, Kristen( Tuesday Knight), Kincade(Ken Sagoes), and Joey( Roddney Eastman) believe they have defeated Freddie Kruger( Robert Englund- V movies).The movie begins with Kristen dreaming about Freddie. She is terrified and brings Kincade and Joey into it. Kincade and Joey are not amused by her special talent she has; and reassure her Freddie is dead. They even have her touch the boiler pipes and they are cold. The next day she drives to Rick( Andres Jones) and Alice Johnson's House( Lisa Wilcox) to pick them up for school. Rick is Kristen's boyfriend, and Alice is a good friend of Kristen's. Alice is the shy one of the group, a plain Jane, who covers her mirror, and hides her true beauty. Rick is more of the outgoing type who loves martial arts. The two sibs are tight and not real fond of their father, Mr. Johnson( Nicholas Mele) who has a major drinking problem.When they get to school, Kincade and joey meet up with Kristen before class. They tell her she needs to stop with her unusual talent. It isn't needed anymore, and it's time to start living a normal life. Kristen knows that Freddie is returning, her dream is a warning, but the other's refuse to believe her. That night Kincade falls asleep while playing darts on his bed. He finds himself in the junkyard were Freddie is buried. Freddie starts to reanimate and kills Kincade. That same night joey's home listening to his music and looks at this hot Hawaiian Tropic calendar girl. He starts to dream about her, then Freddie appears and kills him during his erotic dream. The next day she walks into class with Lisa, she sees Joey and Kincade are absent. She then finds out they were both killed last night. She starts to freak out ; and accidentally hits her head on a wall. She passes out and finds herself in the nurses station. When she wakes she sees Freddie dressed as a nurse, but realizes it's only a dream.Later that day Kristen tells her friends about the history of Fred Kruger. They all go to Elm Street where it started; the old house at 1428. Among those with her are, Shelia (Toy Newkirk)the brain, Debbie(Brooke Theiss) the popular one, Dan( Danny Hassel) the jock, Rick and Alice. When they first hear it they brush it off. While there Kristen's mom, Elaine( Brooke Bundy)pulls up, makes a scene, and takes her home. Her mother who is highly eccentric, is one of the parents responsible for torching Freddy. That night while she and her mother are eating. Her mom puts sleeping pills in Kristen's drink, without her knowledge until it's too late. Kristen freaks and tries to call Alice for help. Kristen tries to remember what Alice told her about the Dream Master- remembering your in control. When Freddie eventually appears in her dream, she pulls Alice in. Alice sees Freddie for the 1st time, and Alice tries to help Kristen before it's too late. Freddie is too strong and before Kristen perishes she gives Alice her powers. Now that the last of the of the Elm Street children are gone, it's time for Freddie to begin a new reign of terror. Freddie will confront a new foe one more powerful then him, The Dream Master.Alice begins to notice changes in herself after Kristen's death. She begins to smoke, Kristen's habit not her's; Alice also begins to grow out of her shell. The next day at school she sees Shelia before the big Physic's exam. Alice comments on the lack of sleep Shelia got and asks Shelia if she saw him too. Shelia doesn't know what she is talking about, and tells her she was cramming for the exam. When she and Alice begin to take the exam she see's that Sheila is in trouble. She has fallen asleep and begins to dream about Freddie. Alice is helpless and Shelia begins to have an Asthma attack that eventually kills her.Alice begins to use Shelia's old phrase, "" Mind Over Matter"" and after the death of her brother she begins to become a martial arts expert. After each murder she is able to absorb her friends traits and abilities. She has transformed from something meek to a powerhouse to be reckoned with. She is also gaining the attention of the hottest guys in school, Dan. There are only three left, Alice, Dan, and Debbie. That night they make a plan to stop Freddie. Alice and Dan are going to meet Deb at her place. While Debbie is getting a quick workout in, Freddie appears. She tries everything to make him disappear, but Freddie transforms her into her worst fear A Cockroach. She is finds herself in a roach trap with no way out, now that is a nightmare.
In the meantime, Dan and Alice are going around in circles. Alice realizes they are both asleep When the two finally wake, Alice is jolted. She realizes Freddie has claimed another victim, Debbie. She tells Dan that she is driving, while on the road , she sees Freddie and runs him over. All it does is total the truck and seriously hurts Dan. He is taken to the hospital were Dan needs immediate surgery. While under sedation Dan has a close call with Freddie., but is able to pull through. Alice takes off from the hospital to have a final confrontation with Kruger. Alice has her friend's power's-abilities and this time he has met his match, with The DREAM MASTER. She is able to defeat Kruger, and release those souls of the children he had collected over time.The next day after defeating Kruger she and Dan are walking together. The are reminiscing about the times. They soon come across a fountain, and Dan gives her a coin. She makes a wish, but keeps it secret. As they walk away Alice sees an image of Kruger in the bottom of the fountain. Wondering is it really over?
This film is highly recommended, but it should have been the final one. I stated to watch 5 and couldn't gent through it. Out of the first four I believe Freddy's Revenge is the weakest, but it's still a neat movie. The Dream Master will either be a movie you either like or dislike, but your the one who has to be the critic.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
107,Med-Jasta,And Renny Harlin never got any better...,4,3 September 2021,"I think this movie was more occupied with appealing to the MTV demographic than making a good movie. There are several musical montages, her ""punking up"" at the end and of course the actual MTV commercial. The idea of Freddy trying to get more kids is good but they kill the ""dream warriors"" so fast and not fast enough. They get killed really fast to become a second movie halfway through. When it should have been all about them. I don't know if the kids cost too much money this time around or what.The acting is much better than two as well as the general writing. Two has a better story but the characters and writing are bad. Of course this doesn't come anywhere close to three. And one is all on it's own.Freddy's ""death"" is cool looking but they really didn't have enough of the special effects stuff. That's what really sets these apart from that other slashers. Which makes me think they made this one on the cheap.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
108,jcbutthead86,"A Wonderful,Thrilling And Entertaining Sequel And One Of The Best Elm Street Films.",10,26 March 2014,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 4:The Dream Master is a wonderful,thrilling and entertaining sequel that is filled with dazzling direction,a great cast and a fantastic soundtrack. All of those combined elements make The Dream Master a memorable sequel and one of the best Elm Street films.Set a year later after the events in Dream Warriors,The Dream Master shows the last of the Elm Street kids Kristen(Tuesday Knight),Joey(Rodney Eastman)and Kincaid(Ken Sagoes)trying to live normal lives after being released from the mental hospital. Everything is going well until Freddy Krueger(Robert England)is brought back from the dead and is once again stalking Kristen and her friends including her friend Alice(Lisa Wilcox)in their dreams. With Freddy around in every corner of her dreams Alice now must figure out how to defeat Freddy and stop him for good.Released in the Summer of 1988,A Nightmare On Elm Street 4:The Dream Master is a terrific and entertaining sequel that many would agree was the Freddy Krueger character and Elm Street series at the peak of it's popularity. Despite being the highest grossing film of the Elm Street series(that is until Freddy Vs Jason in 2003)at 48$ million dollars,the film has divided Elm Street and Horror fans over the years where some like this film and some don't. I fall into the former category because I think Dream Master is an underrated sequel. From beginning to end The Dream Master is a thrill ride a film that pretty much expands on the ideas and explosiveness that was set-up with Dream Warriors and while The Dream Master is not as good as Dream Warriors The Dream Master is a great follow up. From the opening credits,The Dream Master hints that this movie was going to be different from the previous Elm Street films and that is one of the things that I like about the film. DM was produced when Action films were big and MTV was in it's prime and DM is a reflection of Action films and MTV's influence with the film and story moving at a fast pace and never slowing down with the editing going quicker than it had before with rapid cuts grabbing you by the throat and never letting you go. The Dream sequences in DM are thrilling and imaginative with some of the Dream sequences being Suspenseful while others are dazzling with an Action style that never stops. So while DM is a Horror film it's more of a Action-Horror movie. Another thing that is different and good about DM is the look of the movie because while the first three films had a dark and brooding look to them the look of DM is very bright and colorful using different colors schemes that are big in the background and give the movie more of a fun feel to it not only making DM the brightest looking film in the series but also telling viewers to have a good time and to not take the movie seriously. Freddy Krueger is back once again and instead of being a supporting character in the first three movies he is the star in this one. Like I said before in my review of Dream Warriors Freddy's portrayal in 4,5 and 6 have divided fans some liking the jokes and one-liners he says in those films and others not liking them. I for one like the jokes and in my opinion Freddy was probably the funniest in this spitting out jokes with a darkly funny glee while killing people in their dreams. Despite being funny,Freddy has not lost his mean streak when it comes to killing people and in DM Freddy has a couple of kills in this movie that are mean and cruel. Alice is another great heroine in the Elm Street series because in the beginning her mind often wonders and she's a push over the beginning of the film but as the movie moves along we see Alice get tough and is able to go up against Freddy with guts and determination and we as the viewers root for her to survive. The ending of The Dream Master is one of the best endings in all of the films because there is Action,thrills and surprises all in one. A great ending.The cast is great. Robert England is excellent once again as Freddy Krueger,with England bringing charisma and spitting out funny one-liners and jokes. Lisa Wilcox is terrific as heroine Alice,with Wilcox being sympathetic and tough. Tuesday Knight(replacing Patricia Arquette)does a wonderful job as Kristen,showing the right emotions with the performance. Andres Jones does a great job as Rick,Alice's older brother and Kristen's boyfriend. Danny Hassal is good as Dan,Alice's love interest. Brooke Theiss is tough and intense as Debbie,Alice's tough friend. Toy Newkirk is memorable as Shelia,Alice's smart friend. Rodney Eastman(Joey)and Ken Sagoes(Kincaid)do fine jobs once again as the last of the Dream Warriors and Kristen friends.The direction by Renny Harlin is amazing and stylish,with Harlin always moving the camera with great angles and giving the film a dazzling visual style. Wonderful job,Harlin.The score by Craig Safan is effective,moody and matches the energy of the film. Good score,Safan. The movie also has an fantastic soundtrack that includes songs by Vinnie Vincent Invasion(Love Kills),Billy Idol(Fatal Charm),Sinead O'Connor(I Want Your(Hands On Me),Dramarama(Anything,Anything),The Fat Boys and Robert England(Are You Ready For Freddy),Go West(Don't Be Afraid Of Your Dreams),Blondie(In The Flesh),Divinyls(Back To The Wall),Tuesday Knight(Running From This Nightmare)and more. An amazing soundtrack In final word,if you love the Elm Street films or Horror films in general,I highly suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street 4:The Dream Master,an entertaining and underrated sequel that is one of the best Elm Street films. 9.5/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
109,Rendanlovell,Nope,5,9 August 2020,"Straight from the get go, this had a major hurdle to overcome, Freddy. Or, more specifically, Freddy being dead. Would you go the convoluted resurrection way or make a Friday the 13th Part 5? Where a character pretends to be the killer. Or maybe you just have him back, no explanation.That was my major concern going into this, and after seeing it, I feel a certain degree of vindication. Because the thing they settled on to being Freddy back managed to be so much worse then I could have imagined. In a dream, a dog pisses fire onto Freddy's grave from the previous movie. Which apparently brings him back to life?There is so much about this I dislike. For starters, why can a dog travel into people's dreams? Why does the dog shoot fire from his dog dick? And why does this dick fire reanimate Freddy's bones? Also, wasn't Freddy buried on hallowed ground in the real world? But now his bones and burial site is in a dream?There's so much about this I just don't like. Another element I wasn't a fan of was bringing some of the characters back from last film. There's only 2 of them and they have 1 seen before getting offed by Freddy. What was the point in bringing them back? What would change by cutting them out? Sure it would essentially be a carbon copy of the original but I feel like that would be better then this.Some of the execution in this is that of a tv movie. The actors may be the worst of the series so far and the visuals are not up to par for this series. The creativity is severely lacking which means the majority of the kills are immensely lame. There's a sort of near water bed kill but it only amounts to a kid being pushed under the water then blood appears from nowhere. Most of the kills are like this. Poorly shot, edited, and staged.Like the acting, the dialogue is rough. There are a number of lines that stand out as truly awful. ""Mom, I'll tell ya. When two of your friends die in the same day, see what that does to your appetite."" Then, the horrifically bland or cartoony. The main characters parents are all absurdly over the top. You got a drunk dad who does nothing but yell at his kids and even an uppity country club mom.Is the Kristen in this supposed to be Patricia Arquette from the last one? If so that isn't communicated very well at all. Much like everything in this. It's a sloppy mess of stupid ideas and even worse execution. Nothing makes any sense. It's truly terrible.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

The story is about Kristen, Joey and Kincaid return to the film from the previous film A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, expect Kristen is now played by Tuesday Knight instead Patricia Arquette. I heard the reason why Patricia Arquette wasn't in this film, was because she was pregnant at the time.So the three soul survivors return to the film and they are no longer in asylum and they are living normal lives and they are attending high school. Kristen still feels that Freddy is still alive. Joey and Kincaid tell her, no he is not but Kincaid has this dream Freddy is resurrected. Dog pie fire on Freddy's grave and opens the grave and he is resurrected by that. Freddy kills Kristen, Joey and Kincaid. Once Kristen is dead Kristen gives her powers to this girl Alice (Lisa Wilcox). Alice has the power where she can call people by name or bring people in to her dream. Because Freddy killed the last Elm Street children which is Kristen, Joey and Kincaid. He can't kill anybody else, now that he is invading Alice dreams, he's trying to get her call people by name trying to bring her more victims and she doesn't do intentionally. She brings some of her friends in her dreams and he kills them. Every time he kills one of her friends she posses something that they have their ability's. He kills her brother and her brother was a martial artist. She posses that power her special skill and all the special skill they have, she makes her stronger, so that she can defat Freddy. On the end of the film it has Alice and Freddy battling each other in the church. Alice frees all the souls and saves her boyfriend from his death.The movie it self is entertaining, it has really good visuals it was directed really well. Freddy looks really cool in this movie. His make up looks really cool in this film. It is the best make up job in this one. 3 and 4 his make up looks really good. The special effects are really good. It doesn't look like low budget film anymore, than previous 3 films were. The dream sequences they are still good sequences. It is still scary and Freddy is still creepy. When Rick (Andras Jones) dies and Alice (Lisa Wilcox) screams there is an explosion in a class room. In the opening sequence actress Tuesday Knight as Kristen Parker dreams that Freddy is back and it is still creepy dream sequence I love it!I love this film to death I love Lisa Wilcox as Alice Johnson she was good horror heroine and the sole survivor she was never killed off even in the sequel I like that. I like the action sequences in the movie, the battle in the church between Alice and Freddy I love that end the finale. Renny Harlin did a good job directing the film. My favorite Renny Harlin is Cliffhanger withy Sylvester Stallone. He directed Die Hard 2, Deep Blue Sea, Long Kiss Goodnight and Mindhunters. Those movies I like a lot.A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) is a decent sequel it is my third favorite ""Elm Street"" movie with the original slasher gory film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) I love it. The movie has a cool soundtracks: Don't Be Afraid Of Your Dreams by Go west I love that song I have it in my ring cell it is my favorite soundtrack. Anything, Anything by Dramarama, Back To The Wall by Divinyls, Are You Ready For Freddy? The Fat Boys and Robert Englund and of course Nightmare by Tuesday Knight the best song ever.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
113,ReelCheese,Best in the Series,7,13 June 2006,"This fast-paced and entertaining sequel may have plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon, but since when did that matter in 1980s gore horror? From director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) comes this effort in which the hideous dream-invading Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) attempts to track down -- and bring demise to -- the last of the Elm Street kids. But he gets more than he bargained for when Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight) wills her power to draw others into dreams to friend Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox). This proved to be a divisive entry in the long-running series, with many fans either loving it or hating it. It has also been criticized for allegedly turning Freddy into an anti-hero figure, but that's hard to accept given his continued adherence to terror. Like so many other horror films of its era, it's not all that scary, but it is fun. In fact, it's the best ""Elm Street"" film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

115,TheRedDeath30,Horrible Sequel to Horror Classic,4,22 September 2014,"I am really astounded by how many people are stating that this is the best of the sequels in their reviews. I guess it's a funny argument to have, in the first place, because we are essentially saying ""This is the best pile of poo"". The original NOES is a horror classic, full of dark, surreal imagery and a truly sinister, nightmarish villain. The sequels got further and further away from what made the original so great until we come to this disaster of a movie.Nothing is good about this, at all. My 4 star rating is based, really, in the fact that we accept it's not good. Most horror sequels are not, especially by the time you get to the 4th in a series, but you watch them for some escapism and some cheesy popcorn fun. That does not make it a good movie, in any way.Let's start with Freddy. Even in the 2nd movie, they started to erode some of the cruelty of the character. That continued to grow with each sequel. By giving him more screen time and more horrible one-liners, Freddy became Rodney Dangerfield with knives. The sheer terror you felt at his presence in the original is long gone, replaced by a wisecracking comic book villain.The kills are ridiculous in this movie. The original made some effort to connect what was occurring in the dream world to what was happening in real life. Whatever fate a character suffered was typically mirrored in their real world. They just gave up on that concept altogether by this point to bring us increasingly far- fetched kill scenes. This would be forgivable if the effects weren't so damn bad. This is not an example of me forgetting the time period this was created in. Even for its' time, these were bad effects. They wrote scenes into the movie that they couldn't possible pull off convincingly, highlighted by the cockroach death which is one of the stupidest effects scenes in any horror movie.Now we get to the teenagers who are the worst of the series yet. Not one character is really likable or memorable. Many seem to be infatuated with Tuesday Knight, for some reason, but she's no Patricia Arquette. The dialog is horrible, the acting is bad. Most of this is caused by a script that seems to want to force far too much plot into its' run time. They kill off the three characters who lasted from the previous movie within the first half hour only to set up a ludicrous scene where one character passes her powers on to another. Even putting suspension of belief aside, how does any hero pass their super power to another? I know I'm reading far too much into this, but it's just pure laziness on the part of the script writers.Finally, the direction and cinematography is all wrong as well. The surrealist look is gone, the dark tones are gone, the nightmare quality is gone. It's much more reminiscent of a comic book, by this point, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing in itself if this were some other movie, but when compared to Craven's original masterpiece, this is just a pale imitation.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
116,happyendingrocks,"Freddy's a terrible stand-up comedian, but he sure knows how to kill a bug",7,3 July 2009,"A funny thing happened to Freddy Krueger somewhere between the cross-cultural push for A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors and this fourth chapter: Our latex-faced pun factory somehow became a Pop culture icon. Posters, dolls, and even squirt guns hit store shelves, and the Elm Street franchise became more about marketing blitz than horror. Scary scenes gave way to scary amounts of merchandising money, and a character who once lurked in the shadows of our subconscious nightmares was soon just as at home as a blurry bit of pixelation on your NES console.Though memory is a bit fuzzy as to which Freddy products came out before, during, and after A Nightmare On Elm Street 4, the film was regardless the first in the series produced under the umbrella of Freddy as a viable mainstream property (looking back, it's actually quite amazing there was never an Elm Street Saturday morning cartoon). With more money in the production budget, and a clearer sense of who the core demographic for Freddy's nocturnal mayhem was, The Dream Master looks immediately different than any entry in the series up to that point. This film is Freddy as tailored for the MTV generation (there is even a commercial for the channel in the film... which repeats twice, no less). Somehow, the idea of a maniacal night-stalker being given a high-gloss makeover simply doesn't sound frightening, which would lead many to anticipate this film to be a new low in the already fading franchise.Shockingly, when you remove any expectations of watching a horror movie from this experience, Elm Street 4 actually ends up being one of the best outings in the series, loaded with enough unique ideas to fill several films, and enough special effects to fill a hundred.Tellingly, the opening credits list more FX personnel than actors, as the real star of this show is the visual effects. Our young cast embodies characters who are so one-dimensional that we only learn enough about them to set up their eventual demise (Rick does kung-fu and is killed in a dream dojo, Debbie hates cockroaches and meets her fate in the bizarro ""Roach Motel"" sequence, etc.).So, we've clearly shifted gears from a horror franchise to a series of fantasy-based films. But once you adjust to this change, it's hard not to be impressed by how fantastic the fantasy elements are. Freddy's blades are all but retired here, replaced by a new ability to insert our characters into a funhouse designed especially for their singular traits. But the film-makers weave such a rich and clever tapestry of dreamland dementia, it's nearly impossible not to get sucked into it with our doomed teens.The film, admittedly, also has weaknesses galore. Our previous heroine Kristen returns, but instead of the strong and multi-layered character essayed by Patricia Arquette in Dream Warriors, we get a neurotic and generally annoying turn by reliever Tuesday Knight. The MTV elements come to the forefront thanks to a loaded soundtrack (admission: I paid 39 dollars for a CD copy of it on eBay) that combines the awesome with the awful, so the film has aged poorly because of its dated tunes. (It's also worth noting that the producers were far too literal in their song selection: The film opens with a song with the chorus refrain ""running from this nightmare"" and closes with a number that repeats the mantra ""don't be afraid of your dreams""). More disturbingly, Freddy's tendencies toward lame humor, only hinted at in previous outings, now dominate his character, and the cackling antagonist is unable to be on screen for 10 seconds without delivering a groaning zinger.But, dude, those effects! The smörgåsbord on display here runs like a textbook, and almost no area of special effects is left undiscovered by the film's end. The film-makers also enlisted several different teams to produce all of these wonders, so each nightmare sequence has a unique stamp that fits with the individualized nature of each death.Problematic? Yes. But this entry is far better in terms of simple entertainment than most give it credit for. Taken on its own, it holds up remarkably well, even if as part of a franchise that once generated genuine scares, it doesn't quite live up to expectations.We're removed from the media blitz now (at least until the ""re-imagining"" of the original Elm Street comes out), so it's a good time to take another look at an outing that sets a high bar for imagination and ingenuity that would never be matched again in a Nightmare film. Give it one more shot.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
117,Toronto85,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,9,23 March 2011,"Nightmare 4 is definitely one of the funniest and underrated sequels in the Freddy franchise. It continues off from where we left off from part 3 with the remaining dream warriors Joey, Kincaid, and Kristen. They are out of the hospital and back in high school when Freddy once again is resurrected from beyond the grave. The survivors from the 3rd are picked off early on, and it's now up to Kristen's friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox) to beat him. Alice gets Kristen's power of bringing others into her dreams. Eventually Freddy kills off many more of her friends, each time gaining a personality trait from the victims. When one teen dies, she gains his martial arts skills, etc, etc. All of this leads to a pretty good conclusion involving a final beat down between Freddy and Alice.This movie is like an eighties flash back. There are many reference to eighties culture and fashion not to mention the music. Nightmare 4 has a great soundtrack, including Tuesday Knight's song which opens the film. I like the continuation of the dream warriors storyline and I loved the character of Alice. This movie is also very funny. Freddy Krueger is probably the most comedic in part 4 with his long list of one liners before and after each death. The characters are also well created and likable too.There's something about the fourth Freddy, I always had a soft spot for it. It was one of the highest grossing sequels at the box office as well. I probably liked Brooke Theiss' character of Debbie the most in the movie. She also had some of the creative scenes and sequences involving a life size roach motel. Freddy was also at his peak in popularity when this came out. The sequels after this one for the most part weren't as interesting and not as good at all.9/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

A great handful of characters are walking clichés, and you don't entirely latch onto any one of them (They're all disposable victims basically; Bodies to barrel up). Just like most of the Nightmare flicks, the movie doesn't start picking up speed until it's finale, which is actually meticulously stimulating, in an evidently guilty-sort-of-fashion. There are some legitemently enjoyable, inventive moments in The Dream Master, but the flaws significantly outweigh these few gracious positives.

119,Mr_Censored,Scary? Not so much. Entertaining? You bet!,7,15 October 2008,"Once the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series gained some footing with 1987's ""The Dream Warriors,"" the sequels started coming faster and the plot started to get a little more consistent. Although such success would quickly evade the franchise again, the follow-up film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,"" was a worthy, entertaining and consistent follow-up to such a successful film. With the three remaining survivors of the third flick returning (Patricia Arquette is replaced by a blatantly different Tuesday Knight) and a new batch of likable (a rarity in the 80's) characters introduced simultaneously, we are given a story that finally feels like it is going somewhere. Having dispatched of the children on Elm Street, Freddy has set his sights on the rest of Springwood but gets more than he bargained for when he crosses paths with a shy, yet, resilient waitress by the name of Alice. Like the characters in ""Dream Warriors,"" Alice finds her true strength in the dream world and becomes a formidable obstacle for Krueger. Unfortunately for the other children of Elm Street, Freddy is getting stronger and is getting better at exploiting their weaknesses, resulting is some rather gruesome scenarios.Truth be told, the fourth installment in the series is a real crowd pleaser. Not only does it sport some of the most outrageous and inventive death scenes of the series, but it is also the most stylized and visually appealing  still to this day  thanks to director Renny Harlin. However, seeing Freddy step foot on a beach, sporting shades is a bit much. Unfortunately for an otherwise solid installment in the series, ""The Dream Master"" is hampered by a gradual insistence on making Freddy the main attraction, the anti-hero. It worked to an extent in the previous film, but it verges on overkill here. There are moments where Freddy resembles the devil himself, but others, where he comes across as a ridiculous prankster, a trendy catchphrase of an era. Thankfully, the rest of the film is up-to-par, so one flaw isn't fatal. The story  at least for a mid-80's horror film  is there, and all the right pieces are in place for a good time. If you come for the out-of-this-world dream sequences, stay for the characters, because like it's predecessor, ""The Dream Master"" gives us a cast to care about, characters who will carry on into the next film, all as part of what can be called ""The Dream Trilogy,"" the three films in the series with true continuity. While it may not be the most thought-provoking or profound film in the series, it's definitely among the most satisfying and entertaining. From giant cockroaches to dogs who urinate fire, this is one film you're not soon to forget.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

A great sequel in the franchise that followers on really well from Dream Warriors and continues the good mix of Horror and Comedy. We also get the introduction of one my favourite characters in the franchise Alice.This sequel is great but a bit of a step down from Dream Warriors but I really like It the kills are amazing and again very creative and the characters are great although they are quite predictable in my opinion.Alice is a great character and my second favourite final girl after Nancy in this franchise and seeing her character grow in this film is really well handled and I love the idea of her taking on the trades and skills of the people who have been killed in the there dreams after freddy has used her to kill them. Such a geat idea and an interesting twist for the franchise the idea of her being the Dream Master of good dreams against Freddy is brilliant.Now there are a some dated effects and I'm not a fan of them killing the survivors of the previous film in the first 10 minutes of the movie.
Also there is one kill that is not good and that is the Karate Kill its a stupid scene that kinda looks out of place.My Favourite moment is definitely the bug kill its such a creative kill and Freddy is brillaint in that scene as well as the rest of the movie he has some great one liners but they definitely go more for Comedy and the mix of Horror and Comedy isnt as good as in Dream Warriors but it's Still great and I enjoy watching this movie.I also like the scene of them Alice and Dan in a time loop during one of the kills its such an interesting idea and I wish the franchise would of used it more that element really suits the Nightmare Franchise.Verdict 8.5 /10 a great sequel with a great introduction for Alice, Freddy is great as always and the kills apart from one are very good and very creative.

One of them was that there were no skeptics among the kids, even those of them who did not believe in Freddy Krueger, did not try to prove that he doesn't exist, they reacted like it was nothing special, like it is normal for people to tell these kind of stories. Actauly I'm glad that there almost wasn't scenes where one tries to prove to another that Freddy don't exist, because usually it is so boring. If you liked previous A Nightmare on Elm Street films than you'll like this one too.

The plot: Three of the survivors from part 3 are still at high school and one, Kirsten, is convinced that Freddy is not dead. She's a smart girl. Well, soon enough, Freddy is resurrected when, in a dream, a dog urinates fire onto his unconsecrated grave (I'm not making this up) and duly dispatches the three of them, but not before Kirsten can pass on her ability to pull people into dreams to her friend Alice, a fine looking young filly, enabling her to seek assistance when Freddy comes a-stalking. Whilst there is nothing new on offer here, still this ticks all the right boxes and has some moments of genuine gore thanks mainly, I imagine, to the presence of Screaming Mad George, he who came to infamy through his effects work on the magnificent Society. Marks dropped here are mainly down to the limp ending, in which Alice tries to beat Freddy up. Never going to work, love. Never going to work.....

Especially the finale is engrossing to say the least. Judging by the title, my favorite kill has to be that. It's hilarious and original. I wished for a bit more of that. Though we do get the usual few stabs in this as well which are always a let down.Logic wise its getting a bit more and more off the rails, but for a movie like this, I can accept it being a bit ''out there''. Also, interestingly the kills in this movie are not mysterious as they were in previous ones, where the police would get involved, here it all gets explained as natural causes.. which sometimes works, but they definitely leave some plot holes.Freddy is good in this as well, some great lines here and there, some work, some don't, but that's nothing new.All in all enjoyed this part a lot more.

126,HorrorFan1984,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,9,11 April 2020,"With a significantly larger budget, and stuck in the peak of 80's pop culture, Freddy Krueger returns in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 to claim the lives of more children living on the deadly street.Following the events of the third film, we see Kristen (now played by Tuesday Knight) getting back into normal teenage life after being released from the psychiatric hospital. Also back in the high school world are Joey and Kinkaid, although we learn they are not in Kristen's clique of friends there.Freddy comes back to live and quickly dispatches the survivors from the 3rd film (sadly), leading Kristen to draw her best friend Alice into the nightmare. Once Alice witnesses Kristen's murder, Freddy turns his target to her and her friends despite not being the children of parents who killed him all those years ago. There is a special new twist called the Dream Master which allows Alice to control her dreams. It'll be up to her to stop Freddy's reign of terror.This film is so 1980's and I love it. We get the clothes, the hair, talks of soap operas like Dynasty, etc. We also get a really cool 80's soundtrack featuring Sinead O'Connor and the annoyingly catchy title song ""Running from this Nightmare"" performed by Tuesday Knight. I can see why it did so well at the box office in 1988. Freddy Krueger was a legendary villain by this point, and his hilarious one-liners only added to the fanfare. Robert Englund got the chance to be hilarious in this fourth film, which is likely why it is his favourite of the series.Great acting all around from the entire cast yet again. Lisa Wilcox is an instant fan favourite as Alice our new Elm Street heroine. Robert England puts in arguably his best work at Freddy in this one thanks to a script which allows him to show his comedic flare. Notable standouts were Brooke Theiss as the Dynasty loving big haired teen Debbie, and Toy Newkirk as Sheila the asthma riddled nerdy type.Nightmare 4 is right up there with parts 1 and 3 as my favourite of the series, for many different reasons. It's the funniest and wittiest by far, allowing Freddy Krueger to be the one liner villain he is known as today.

Part One is a classic horror movie, Part Two was terrible and Part Three was fantastic. So I had absolutely no idea what to expect from Part Four. What i got was an average Freddy Krueger adventure, neither great nor awful, somewhere in between but certainly closer to awful than great. The acting from most of the cast in this one is pretty poor although Lisa Wilcox makes a pretty good stab at the heroine and she's certainly nice to look at. What saves this movie though is the superb special effects, a great 80's soundtrack and of course Freddy played again by the great Robert Englund. Also some pretty inventive deaths with the highlight being the cockroach transformation and Freddies ""death"", yeah right Fred seeya in part Five.

This turn of unexpected events is what makes this film so good.At first you think you are watching yet another Nightmare film, but there are a few strange twists in the movie that add more depth and character to the series as a whole.Very nice (and with that I mean creative and nasty) deaths in this movie too.

129,shaun98,Series begins showing its age,5,12 April 2002,"Well, it was inevitable. After the box-office success of the first three ""Nightmare"" movies, business dictated that there be a fourth, logic be damned. Wes Craven had attempted to wrap up the series with part 3, but you can't keep a good ghoul down. The last film clearly implied that Freddy was gone for good, so any attempt to bring him back is blatant commercialism at its worst. It doesn't help that the method used to revive him is just plain silly, even if it's a dream sequence. (It does assume you've seen the last one) He isn't even scary any longer; his character has been reduced to a comedian.Upon his return, he sets out to complete his unfinished business: the slaughter of the last of the Elm Street children. This pretty much negates their previous victory over him, but never mind: New Line has some cash to rake in. Patricia Arquette wisely refused to reprise her role, so the Kristen character was recast. Tuesday Knight isn't as good, and quite frankly it doesn't even feel like the same character. This is a clear sign that as long as they were going to make a sequel, a fresh start, with entirely new characters, was warranted. As the so-called ""Dream Master,"" Lisa Wilcox is okay, but her part isn't milked for all its worth. She pretty much has Kristen's powers passed down to her and that's it.On the technical side it's admittedly well-made. Renny Harlin makes everything slick and glossy, you'd expect no less from the man who later gave us ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Cliffhanger."" Robert England is as gleefully bad as ever, and the manner in which Freddy makes his demise is actually quite gripping on a visceral level.

The visuals back then in 1988 were really tough to pull off, but it was really cool and amazing for today's world in this day and age.The music is really dark and sinister and the Freddy Krueger theme does play at some point. I love the dark and sinister tone of the film and also comedic at certain points. Freddy Krueger's make-up design is still good as it was in the previous films.The acting is back and fourth at some points. The credit is all given to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and he is alright in his fourth portrayal as Freddy Krueger and I really got to see more humor and there is one scene and that is Kristen's nightmare at the beach and he really does kill it with his awesome humor.Since Patricia Arquette could not return due to her being involved in other projects, Tuesday Knight fills in for her as Kristen Parker and she definitely nails her performance and it could have been worse, but it is a damn good performance for this character.Lisa Wilcox plays our new primary protagonist, Alice Johnson and she does a damn good job in playing the role of Alice and it is not Oscar worthy, but it is really good and she was the perfect choice to a new enemy to our antagonist, Freddy Krueger.Danny Hassle plays Alice's boyfriend, Dan Jordan and he is top-notch and just like Lisa Wilcox, he could not have done any better. They have great chemistry on the screen and it definitely shows all the way throughout this entire fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film in the scary film franchise.The rest of the cast is just out there and they make either a huge or very little effort to put on a darn good performance and it is really intense and I really can't blame them because they try they're absolute best but does not deliver when they really need too.The nightmares in this film are just incredible: You have Freddy Krueger sucking the life out of one girl, turning her into a cockroach and that was pretty cool. The other nightmare is Kristen's two nightmares at the beginning and middle of the film and those are way too scary, but I love them because they are like this. Another nightmare is Kincaid's nightmare. He is trapped in a salvage yard and he is brutally stabbed in the stomach and it is very dark and serious and really cool.The other nightmares I will keep short: Joey's nightmare involves him on a waterbed and is tricked into thinking a supermodel is swimming before Freddy kills him and that was just too cool. Sheila is killed by an intense asthma attack. Rick is in a mixed-martial arts nightmare fight and that was really intense and violent. All of the nightmares are not bad, but they are just very dark and serious in a few areas, but Robert Englund's comedy is really amazing and spectacular.Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is just amazing and really scary. It just brings a lot cool stuff into it and the nightmares are really cool and disturbing, but the comedy is in this film a lot more. Alice Johnson's story would continue the next film, which I talk about my hatred feelings, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child."" and this film is really amazing with blending horror and comedy together throughout the whole movie.I give this film a 8 out of 10 stars.

The visuals back then in 1988 were really tough to pull off, but it was really cool and amazing for today's world in this day and age.The music is really dark and sinister and the Freddy Krueger theme does play at some point. I love the dark and sinister tone of the film and also comedic at certain points. Freddy Krueger's make-up design is still good as it was in the previous films.The acting is back and fourth at some points. The credit is all given to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and he is alright in his fourth portrayal as Freddy Krueger and I really got to see more humor and there is one scene and that is Kristen's nightmare at the beach and he really does kill it with his awesome humor.Since Patricia Arquette could not return due to her being involved in other projects, Tuesday Knight fills in for her as Kristen Parker and she definitely nails her performance and it could have been worse, but it is a damn good performance for this character.Lisa Wilcox plays our new primary protagonist, Alice Johnson and she does a damn good job in playing the role of Alice and it is not Oscar worthy, but it is really good and she was the perfect choice to a new enemy to our antagonist, Freddy Krueger.Danny Hassle plays Alice's boyfriend, Dan Jordan and he is top-notch and just like Lisa Wilcox, he could not have done any better. They have great chemistry on the screen and it definitely shows all the way throughout this entire fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film in the scary film franchise.The rest of the cast is just out there and they make either a huge or very little effort to put on a darn good performance and it is really intense and I really can't blame them because they try they're absolute best but does not deliver when they really need too.The nightmares in this film are just incredible: You have Freddy Krueger sucking the life out of one girl, turning her into a cockroach and that was pretty cool. The other nightmare is Kristen's two nightmares at the beginning and middle of the film and those are way too scary, but I love them because they are like this. Another nightmare is Kincaid's nightmare. He is trapped in a salvage yard and he is brutally stabbed in the stomach and it is very dark and serious and really cool.The other nightmares I will keep short: Joey's nightmare involves him on a waterbed and is tricked into thinking a supermodel is swimming before Freddy kills him and that was just too cool. Sheila is killed by an intense asthma attack. Rick is in a mixed-martial arts nightmare fight and that was really intense and violent. All of the nightmares are not bad, but they are just very dark and serious in a few areas, but Robert Englund's comedy is really amazing and spectacular.Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is just amazing and really scary. It just brings a lot cool stuff into it and the nightmares are really cool and disturbing, but the comedy is in this film a lot more. Alice Johnson's story would continue the next film, which I talk about my mixed feelings, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child."" and this film is really amazing with blending horror and comedy together throughout the whole movie.I give this film a 7 out of 10 stars. Not a bad film, just a little bit scary and disturbing in a few areas.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
132,boyinflares,Fun filled sequel with a great cast of characters,8,8 April 2006,"While other Horror film franchises often let continuity slip through the cracks, the Nightmare on Elm Street films are terrific for their treatment of continuity and history of the previous films. Part 4, ""The Dream Master"" is no exception. This film begins sometime after part 3, with the three survivors and a new group of kids, joining together as Freddy Kruger (once again played by the outstanding Robert Englund) returns to terrorise them.Ken Sagoes and Rodney Eastman reprise their roles of Kincaid and Joey respectfully, while Tuesday Knight takes over the role of Kristen (left vacant by Patricia Arquette). Whereas other horror films just leave the survivors alone, this film follows them as Freddy returns to finish his work, but it also introduces us to a new group of heroes, including Alice (Lisa Wilcox), her brother Rick (Andras Jones), Debbie (Brooke Theiss), Shelia (Toy Newkirk) and Dan (played by the handsome Danny Hassle - who would have to be the hottest male star in all of the Nightmare on Elm Street films).Freddy finds interesting ways to kill off the kids, all of whom have a wide array of personalities and interact with each other well. Nicholas Mele takes up the role of ""bumbling authority figure"" as Alice and Rick's drunken father, while the fabulous Brooke Bundy returns as Kristen's over protective mother. Like part 3, which stared two lead heroines, part 4 has both Kristen and Alice as lead heroines, though one of them does not survive. Tuesday Knight really makes the character of Kristen her own, and also sings the terrific opening theme song.While many people thought part 4 was the first of the downward spiral in terms of quality for the franchise, part 4 is a great film with a wonderful and likable cast of characters - you may find yourself actually caring when they die - and some cool special effects. It is however the first film in which Freddy becomes more of a talker and less of a eerily frightening presence. Enjoy!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

I won't spoil it for anyone, but this movie is ruining the entire climax of the last movie and bastardizing the entire series. Sure, the special effects are nice and the acting is not that bad - But you just don't care for the characters! You just sit back and go ""Wow, Freddy did that"" and ""Freddy did this""... Boring.

It is the best movie in the series that uses the comedy Freddy. I can see how some would say three is the best, but while I see three as a terrific entry it still has the dark tones of the first with just a little better comedy. The darkness in three I believe comes from the fact that Wes Craven wrote and was trying to make Freddy what he should be. But Four blows the flood gates open with the comedy. If you don't laugh at this movie your dead. Freddy has a few good scares in this but he becomes like a stand up comic after every kill. The water bed death, and karate kills are the best, the cockroach death has real vision to it too. I don't know if this is where the series should go but it defiantly is a good movie and I think very few people could disagree with that. Watch this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Terrible acting (Robert Englund was good as always) bad plot if there was one and Freddy had just become a little baby. The story is Following up the previous Nightmare film, dream demon Freddy Krueger is resurrected from his apparent demise, and rapidly tracks down and kills the remainder of the Elm Street kids. However, Kristen (who can draw others into her dreams) wills her special ability to her friend Alice. Alice soon realizes that Freddy is taking advantage of that unknown power to pull a new group of children into his foul domain.

It reunites the survivors of Dream Warriors and brings in a handful of equally interesting and sympathetic teenagers into the mix for Freddy to slice and dice in between cheesy one liners. It's never scary, but it's inventive and the characters and young actors playing them bring a lot of likability to the table which makes you feel really bad one another one of them bites the dust.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
137,Derek237,Freddy Krueger: superstar,6,1 August 2003,"One thing I noticed about this 4th part in the series is that for the first time, they credit Robert Englund first. It used to be ""and Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger,"" but now it's obvious that Freddy Krueger is a huge pop-icon and they started crediting ""Robert Englund in Nightmare on elm street 4."" Quite a big difference, actually. Because now instead of cheering on the kids to defeat Freddy, we cheer on Freddy and want to see some kids get slaughtered. And believe me, the movie does not disappoint in that area.This is probably the goriest of all 7 movies. In one scene, Freddy transforms a girl into a cockroach. In another, he literally sucks the life out of a girl. It still has the same imagination as part 3, but the plot about Freddy getting the kids' souls and the technicalities he goes through to kill more kids gets a bit too far-fetched. But other than that, it has some good characters and of course, deaths. It's the one Freddy movie that I feel is in the middle of the pack. It's better than some movies in the series, but not as good as some of the others. If you're looking for a good body count, The Dream Master delivers.My Rating: 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

139,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,5,20 April 2016,"The fourth installment in the Elm Street series kicks off by bringing Freddy back to life becauseum, some dog pisses on his grave, or something. Or perhaps it was because the (peculiarly recast) Kristen kept on dreaming about his house, which fed him power and ultimately prompted his return? Seems a better reason than the first.The first portion of what is a watchable but by-the-numbers entry in the franchise has Freddy taking revenge on all the dream warriors from the third film. In doing so, the film pulls an Alien 3 by killing of likable, established characters and replacing them with blander and interchangeable ones. Our new protagonist is Alice, who inherits Kristen's dream powers after she is bumped off.Some of the kills were fun to watch. The bug kill was particularly creepy and the rest of the special effects are on par with the rest of the movies. It's just whatever happens in between all the gruesome stuff is forgettable and full of dire acting and uninspired dialogue. The series has really started not to care much more in its rules. I think back to that scene where, in the real world, a Kruger claw mark appears on a locker in the school. What was the point of that, and how did it makes sense within the context of the film? The anticlimactic ending involves Freddy dying (again) by being shown his reflection. Yup. But before that we are treated to a wise- cracking Kruger and ninja fight scenes. Shame.Overall what could have been an excellent companion piece and follow up to part 3 ends up being mildly entertaining but mediocre.Best Scene: The time loop part where Alice is trapped in a scene repeating itself was cool. I've actually had dreams that have played out like that.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
140,jcslawyer,Still a better sequel than 2,7,11 February 2020,"I am a big fan of the franchise and this is my fave after 1 and 3. I don't love that they switched Kristens, but who cares. The movie's still pretty creepy. I know this is when Freddy's cheesy lines start to really shine, but whatever.Story is the same as the others, except this is a direct continuation of 3. You got survivors Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid still reeling (but somehow able to reintegrate back to normal school) and trying to move on. Kristen can't seem to let things go and she still brings her friends into the dreams. They get pissed bc they don't want her to stir crap up. Well, she does.Unfortunately our survivors from the previous are offed one after the other (Joey's being pretty memorable and and homage to Depp's kill in 1). At the same time we're introduced to Alice, a shy loner who begins absorbing her friends' powers after they die. She uses that to defeat Freddy and that's that.Kills are pretty cool....roach motel, ""suck face"", and Rick. It's not the greatest movie, but it's fun and is a good installment. When you're in the fourth movie, you gotta expect cheese, etc.This delivers everything you want in these specific films. Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
141,dudedazzreviews,...and here's where it goes downhill a little,5,6 October 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors really set the bar high as far as the sequels go for this series and I was hoping that A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master would be the same quality as the third movie. Alas, it was not. The story is basically the same as the third minus the psychiatric hospital and with a little twist, basically Freddy is remembered and starts killing in dreams again and Alice must free the tormented teenage souls and to do that, she must kill Freddy. It's all the same thing done with different characters who aren't really very interesting with the exception of Alice who was a little interesting when she daydreamed and, of course, Freddy Krueger. The character development goes down the same weak-teens-become-tough road just like the third and first movie which is fine. The acting is mediocre, Tuesday Knight replaces Patricia Arquette as Kristen and Robert Englund is great as Freddy but the rest of the cast were hit and miss. The nightmare sequences are done great and Freddy yet again makes some humorous one-liners before his kills. The direction is okay and the special effects are rather good but this doesn't beat the first or third, not even close.I did enjoy this movie, I thought it was a decent watch and an okay addition to the series. However, in saying this, I'm half-and-half with the dark humoured Freddy. Don't get me wrong, I think Robert Englund did a fantastic job as the villain from your worst nightmares but I think the movies would have been much more better and scarier if they stuck with Freddy being dark and scary just like in the first movie. The first movie is truly a terrifying experience and a horror masterpiece and every horror movie could take a lesson from it but this wasn't scary in the slightest. The one-liners are a little funny though.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
142,Mattswife97,Another good Nightmare on Elm Street Movie,10,16 February 2002,I've read all the comments and thought I would add it.  I don't know why almost everybody here hated Tuesday Knight for Kristen.  I thought she was so much better than Patricia from the 3rd movie.  I have asthma by the way and no I don't want to suck face.  Alice did a good job playing the innocent Alice who was stuck fighting Freddy all by herself cause Kristen brought her into her dream and gave her powers.  I gave this movie 10 stars out of 10. It makes me sick how Ebert never gives horror movies 2 thumbs up.  He doesn't even give it one thumb up.  He sure doesn't have good taste in movies.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

144,SPaS,The turn-point,5,2 May 2006,"This surreal entry, along with part 3, counts as ""one of the better sequels"" in both ""Elm street"" and the whole splatter universe. The task was both easy and hard: with not much effort this was sure to bring the bucks back, because in 1987 splatters (especially NOES, ESPECIALLY after the good previous sequel) still were hot but to follow the saga worthy of part 3... well, that's another trick. Looking at this one now, almost 20 years later, and having seen the direction of the series AND a whole lot of other splatters from that time it's easy to point out the good & bad.Good: Director Harlin. Not scary, but imaginative. Something fresh. No lulls. Good: Writer. Even though the plot lacks punch (Harlin cleverly gets past this) and the climax is just pulled out of the sleeve you won't get bored. Good drive. In part 3 we had Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell, here we got Brian Helgeland + Ken & Jim Wheat - and Renny Harlin! Considering the genre, what are the odds?In-between: Humour. F13 switched to humor with part 6, too, so... guess this was an inevitable attempt to keep the genre alive. Still, who didn't crack when Freddy put on the Wayfarers on the beach :DBad: Talentless cast. No careers after this, which is to no-ones wonder. Apart from Lisa Wilkox, she had some of ""that something"". Bad: hurried and somewhat forced effort. Easy to see.3 out of 5. Good enough for me",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

The idea of this storyline is for Freddy to finally take out the three remaining children of Elm Street. He didn't plan on running into the Dream Master who was a new teen into the mix.

149,G.Spider,"After Part 3, this is a let-down.",4,14 June 1999,"It's a pity that Wes Craven's initial idea for another sequel to his film, involving time travel in dreams, wasn't used.  Instead of another Craven-directed masterpiece like Part 1 and Part 3 we get this gaudy pantomime instead.  The makers of NOES 4 admitted that they designed and filmed all the special-effects sequences and then found some excuse to cement them together.  It shows.  Freddy is resurrected, though quite how is never explained.  Wasn't it fire that killed him, not brought him back to life?  Anyhow, he begins another killing spree.  There are some interesting ideas - a narcissist being turned into a cockroach, an asthmatic having the air sucked out of her, but the whole thing lacks the tension and nightmarish qualities of the previous film.  Early scenes involving the survivors from Part 3 hold promise, but when Freddy appears he's no more than a wise-cracking buffoon, and the ninja-style violence is pointless and unnecessary.  The climax, if you can call it that, involves Freddy dying as a result of being shown his reflection.  As there's no build-up to it at all it just stands out as an obvious excuse for another special-effects set-piece.Overall, this film might provide entertainment, but it's just disappointing, badly-acted dross, the sort of thing you watch if you've nothing better to do.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

151,Colbridge,Freddy is more jokey than frightening in this one but Renny Harlin does a slick job,5,14 November 2021,"The fourth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise proved to be the most profitable as audiences flocked to see their favourite serial killer terrorise people in their sleep but it's not necessarily the best sequel.By this stage Freddy Krueger was firmly rooted in pop culture and there was an insatiable appetite for more films to see Freddy's one liners, cheesy as most of them are, and imaginative ways the filmmakers could come up with to kill his victims.Renny Harlin takes the directorial reins for this one, and would go on to be a popular action director with box office hits such as Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea. This was only Harlin's second film in Hollywood, having made films in his native country of Finland, and he does a slick job here in keeping within the realms of the original, although due to the average casting it's not quite as engaging as A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors (1987) but still exhibits some interesting ideas, atmospheric scenes and imaginative kills.Robert Englund, who gets star billing for the first time for his now iconic status, does another great job at making Freddy Krueger gleefully evil and wholly despicable but because the victims are so bland we now find ourselves rooting for Freddy.There's some nice visual effects and nightmarish ideas going on in this one with an Alice in Wonderland reference, and it will probably be the first and last time you'll see a dog pissing fire! John Carl Buechler is on special effects duties and would also direct a movie for rival horror franchise Friday the 13th: The New Blood in the same year.The Dream Master does not have such an engaging story as The Dream Warrior and Freddy is more jokey than frightening here but it's not a bad effort considering Wes Craven left the franchise again and left producers Robert Shaye and Rachel Talalay at New Line Cinema to continue the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Cast are audience-age 'young adults', and story makes little sense, other than that, yet again, an evil demon is in your dreams (sans Dokken) and if you don't defeat him . . . your friends will keep dying.Needless to say, this isn't a scary premise, and no amount of VFX weirdness can create genuine horror in the picture, acting skills are mostly OK - a few excellent touches - Freddy emerges from a stream of 'sinister' fiery dog urine, also Kruger stalks a helpless, struggling girl along a beach in broad daylight, trapped in her own lethargic nightmare responses.Is the film good? No. It's so shallow it's nearly disposable, and of course, the idea of actually ""killing"" the (not-living) antagonist seems unlikely as he's the most marketable, identifiable thing New Line Cinema had going at that point.Slick and likable compared to most low budget 80s trash horror, but as usual, the writing and direction leaves a lot to be desired.

Freddy is reduced to a wise-cracking oaf and the plot of 'Master' is really no more than a string of set-pieces cemented together. It has to be said that most of the new characters in this film are just irritating (and Kristen's character has completely changed along with her appearance).Watchable if you're a fan of the series, but if you've seen the first three films then you'd be better off watching 'A New Nightmare' or 'Freddy Vs Jason'.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

161,SUPERNOVA HEIGHTS,Good entertaiment but it could be better,8,2 September 2002,When you watch horror film with sequels you must think that the film that you will watch won't a master piece.And this thing is true.Nightmare on elm street 4 is the perfect example. With this film begins the Alice johnson saga (it continous in the Nightmare 5)the story has got good points and the Fx too Freddy's saga is like scream's saga of the 80's.You can get enjoy with this film and you can pass the time and it entertains you. But in this film There is one mistake which appears in the other parts. it is the originality.All the films in this saga tell you the same thing with different topics and details.If you don't watch this film you don't lose anything but it is a good thing when you are bored,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
162,bhicks56,"In my opinion, the worst of the series...",4,18 November 1999,"Renny Harlin's attempt to carry on the franchise relies too much on special effects than scares. With a premise like the Freddy Krueger movies, it's nice to have a few surreal images, but Harlin overkills the effects (which most aren't special to begin with). And poor Robert Englund. It seems like he's tired as Freddy, whose creepiness is completely draped by the effects and cheap Twilight Zone-like twists.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
163,latherzap,Hated it even when I was 14,2,15 June 2000,"I still consider the first Freddy film a classic, and part 3 was decent. But I was soooo bored watching this.   I remember seeing it ten years ago on cable.  About a half hour into it I wanted to turn it off, but a compulsive part of me wanted to finish it so that I could complete the series.  With fifteen minutes to go I turned it off, and decided to make myself a sandwich ( which promised to be more exciting than the film's ending).     No plot synopsis necessary for this, I'll just say that the characters were absolute cardboard. None of the scenes felt connected to each other. It was like each scene was a 5 minute short created to show off a unique special effect.  Nothing scary to be found here.  I never saw the sequels that came out after this.

The third part was very good and ended very well but this film actually ruins it. Freddy is back (I didn't really understand how) and starts slaughtering kids again. There is a new main character who fights him, a girl named Alice, who has the power of a Dream Master - how it is also not clear. The murders... the murders in this film are OK, but nothing special, the only really gorgeous moment was SPOILERwhen Freddy puts goggles on a beach.END OF SPOILER Overall, a disappointing part in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

166,timefreezer7,Huge disappointment (some spoilers),4,7 June 2001,"Part 3 of the series was a very good finale . The trilogy had come to the right end with a satisfying way to kill Fred Krueger and some brave kids who managed to survive through massive hypnosis . But NOOOOOOOO ! New Line could not resist the temptation of bleeding the suckers dry so they had to spawn another sequel for the obsessed consumers . I would not complain if it was a good movie . But it wasn't . I don 't care if it made more money . It sucked .First of all it is not a movie , it is an excuse for a movie. Before I say anything else the way Krueger is resurrected is ludicrous. A dog p***es fire on his bones !! (pyroureasis) PARDON ????? What is this ? Is it a paganistic symbol of some kind ? A spiritual ceremony ? Personally I have never heard of such a thing . If someone of you readers knows something please e-mail me . Then we have the survivors of part 3 losing all their depth and becoming one dimensional characters . The same goes for the rest of the heroes . Some of the SFX are nice (but other stink) but the lack of plot in this sorry story is beyond obvious . This is not a movie this is a video game. The victums are now more than helpless and they have no way to defend their lives . Freddy appears in only ONE dream , manifests their worst fear and kills them . The bad guy is the hero in this video game!!! That is already a very negative sign . The only one who survives more than one encounters is Alice (Lisa Wilcox). Unfortunately some of the SFX are pure c**p . A person transformed to an insect ??? A pizza with faces of souls ??? COME OOOOOONNNN !!! As for the idea of time loop was clever but utterly underused . The finale unfortunately was not suspenseful . The acting is wooden (but we shouldn 't be expecting much from a horror film) . Alice is very disappointing . She is supposed to be enigmatic daydreamer and simultaneously dynamic warrior for her life . Wilcox is not at all convincing in both ways . (However she was perfect in the next film) . The only actor who managed to give emotion and soul to his character was Andras Jones as Rick who is Alice 's brother . If not the best , definately the most natural performance of the film comes from Rick .
Many have complained about the much colour or the wisecrack lines of Freddy or even for the ninja combats . Personally I believe that in order for a series to survive it must break into new grounds (such as part 3 did with dream manipulation ) . The ninja battle is satisfying and some of Freddy 's lines still give me chills like the classic "" AAGHH!!! How sweet !! Fresh meat !!! "" (which coincidentally reflects the producers' intentions) . But it is the lack of plot which gives on my nerves . You know that Alice is going to survive to play in part 5 and the rest are counting hours , so the ""excuse for a movie"" becomes more evident .Are there any pros ? Yes there are . The school being the basic set transfers the series to a more direct danger . The first dream sequence is delusional and remains faithful to the original spirit . The beautiful chemistry between Rick and Alice gives the only dramatic tensive moments in the film . This is the only soul of the movie Unfortunately I could never give the base to the Renny Harlin film because it destroyed and bastardised the dream warriors . HOWEVER the fact that after 3 times I would still like to see it and the Rick / Alice scenes make it worth of a                      4 / 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
167,Khwaj,A New kind of Elm Street!,8,18 March 2002,"I would like to start by saying that yes, I very much do agree with what many user comments suggested about the series ending with Part 3.If can recall the events, Freddy's ghost mother (i.e Sister Mary-Helena/Amanda Kruger) suggested to the doctor of burying his remains in hollowed grounds. On the plus side two principal characters from the original were also killed off battling Freddy both in the dream world and real (Nancy and her father).With Part 4 however, I have to compliment Renny Harlin.Okay this maybe his first time at directing one of of the episodes, but what an achievement I might add. Stylewise, this really had outdone the three previous ones providing real visual delight and adding some really creative effects.The other reason for me liking this film a lot was because it reflects the 80's culture very well, which brings fresh and rewarding memories back for me.Impressive, vivid and more colorful since the last three were more of a gothic theme. This one though seemed to lighten the load with Freddy's wisecracks being a real laugh and Lisa Wilcox saucy as ever.However this should have REALLY been the last, what a disaster 5 & 6 really were.8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
168,nmp381,"Solid Entry, but the entire series is overrated.",8,17 October 2000,"Nightmare part 4 was actually very good, still a step down from the original but one of the better sequels, (if not the best). The characters are all well acted, with the usual cliche parts. Freddy is more comical then scary, which is one of the reasons it doesn't reach the height of the first one. The special effects were amazing though. All in all, a good sequel to a very long drawn and overrated series.(almost as overrated as the Friday the 13th series).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
169,The Bronson Fan,"""Rest in Hell."" - Alice. Freddy finally meets his match in The Dream Master.",7,31 March 2005,"Freddy returns once again to kill the Elm Street kids, but has he met his match? We begin not long after part 3 with the surviving elm street kids now out of the institution and in high school. The character of Kristen, now played by Tuesday Night rather then Patricia Arquette, returns, but begins to think that Freddy is coming back. Kincad warns her not to bring him up or maybe he will come back. Well he does. This time in Kincaid's dream, he is in the junkyard where his bones were buried. His dog digs where the bones were laid to rest and pees out fire to let him out/bring him back to life. Yes, to this day I can't watch that part without laughing. Freddy axes Kincaid, Joey ( Joey was dork anyway) and is about to take out Kristen. Freddy knows that she is the last and needs her help if he is to kill more. He tricks her into using her power to bring others into her dreams. Her friend Alice (Lisa Wilcox), is pulled in, Kristen dies but gives her power to Alice first. Alice does not understand her power nor how to control it. She ends up bringing her friends and brother to Freddy one by one. As Freddy slashes through more kids, Alice absorbs their powers and becomes the ""Dream Master."" Eventually she confronts Freddy. In the final battle we are treated to a fight that is more than a little corny, but still delivers overall and sends Freddy to hell. But for good? Nightmare on elm Street 4 is probably the last good elm street film made. I still like this move a lot and it is very entertaining. The story overall is OK but for the most part nothing new. You know the story of every series, of the evil one coming back to life to wreak havoc among the stars of the movie. One has to ask, where did they get the idea to revive Freddy by having a dog take fire leak on his bones? WTF? Not to say I'm not amused by this, but who wrote that in? The concept of having Alice gain all the powers that the other kids possessed in their dreams was new though and I thought was one of the better aspects of the movie. Alice's character is also a great replacement for Kristen's and would return in part 5 to wreck Freddy again. Alice is probably the best thing to happen to the series after the death of Nancy. The acting is nothing special, I'm sure you didn't come to see this expecting great acting an neither did I. Freddy once again uses great one liners before taking out his foes. Though they are still good they get worse as the series goes on. The special effects are probably where the movie shines most. Most notably the soul food scene (disgusting), the souls escaping his body, and the movie theater scene. Freddy this time around disposes of them in all sorts of ways. The dream dojo scene with Rick is one of the better scenes in the movie. Anyone notice Rick is that guy Deke from Saved By The Bell that wanted to beat up Screech? Others include Freddy sucking face, roach motel and wet dream, all entertaining. The choreography could have been better, sometimes when the actors where jumping around, it looked out of place. The soundtrack isn't bad either. Typical 80's stuff here, you either love or hate the 80's. Sinaid O'connor's I Want Your Hands On Me, is a good song. But the opening song Nightmare by Tuesday Night is a really great song. Overall a good Freddy film that is fun watch, but certainly don't take it seriously. 7 half out 10 stars.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

173,solidgameboy12-1,Horror's Leg Up in frightening people.,8,20 July 2004,"WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED.Freddy Krueger: The Killer in Nightmare on Elm Street. Horror: A Form of Fright. Horror + Krueger = Level 1 in frighting entertainment.This film starts off with the main character, Kristen (Tuesday Knight) who worries about Freddy (Robert Englund) who could come to life or so she thinks. She keeps summoning her friends because of the gift of bringing others into her dream. Soon Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) and Joey (Rodney Eastman) are killed by Freddy, and Kristen becomes open bait as the last person whose parents murdered Krueger. Before Kristen's death, Alice (Lisa Wilcox) gets the power of bringing people into her dreams. So the game is not over, as she inherits most of Kristen's attributes, like puffing on a cigarette.Freddy has free range to any child that who's parents didn't kill him at all, or have any association with him. Alice feels that she has to take action to defeat Krueger 'Once and for all', so as to sleep again. Most people think that this film was bad because of Freddy's one - liners. It's not. It's what pepper his performance. Truthfully, This film was the best of the series so far. With any hope at all, I hope it gets better. The Music was awesome, The Violence was pretty high. The most graphic scenes are the ones with lots of violence, for instance when a girl's arms down to her elbows break and roach legs grow out of her arm sockets, and her skin peels off and looks like a dead on accurate roach. The Ending's fight sequence was spectacular, and the plot revolved around a rhyme about a dream master, which in the rhyme says something about The Demon seeing within itself to see it's true self, kinda how Alice seems to take the pictures of her window to see her real self.The Only other frighting scene was when the children inside Freddy, the souls of the children rip through Freddy's skin and put him against a wall and rip his mouth open to free all the children.The Ending is not a let down like three, and one thing that you should remember when you see the movie, you must have control of your stomach, or you'll be heavily nauseated all evening. 10/10, with an excellent plot.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
174,forrestwrs,Not Quite Enough For Me,5,12 September 2010,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master I liked just about as much as its predecessor. Yet again, the greatest degenerating factor here is the character development. Or, of course, the lack there of. Actually, the characters here were a little more interesting than the ones in the past two Elm Street movies. Well, one was. I really liked the character of Rick. I truly did. I thought he had a little bit of depth to him and I could really make a connection to this guy. Was he a fantastic character? Not really... but he was still a lot more interesting than a lot of characters I have seen in these movies. Of course, a part of that might even be credit to the actor. He was the one decent actor on screen, besides Englund.For, you see, the acting in Dream Master was deplorable. It wasn't just bad; it was embarrassingly bad. Lisa Wilcox played Alice Johnson, the Final Girl of the last film as well. Except now she is played by an actress who cannot act save her life. It's a shame. She has a very pretty face, but not an acting ability to match. She was over-dramatic part of the time and under dramatic the rest of the time. I could not get a rhythm or sense of truth in her acting at all. It was extremely difficult, for that reason, for me to care for that character. But Wilcox wasn't the only one. Danny Hassle, who played Wilcox's love interest, was equally bad, and I don't think Brooke Theiss (Debbie) was trying at all. I mean, these were really some bad, bad, bad, bad acting. And the dialogue itself was not a whole lot better. Once again, as in the last film, the film decides, inexplicably, to barrage its audience with puns thrown out by Freddy. I always gave Freddy more respect than that, but evidently I gave him too much respect. His character has reached the same level as Mr. Freeze from Batman And Robin.***Warning: Here There Be Spoilers*** And, once again, I am left with a stupid Elm Street movie ending. In the end of the movie, Kristen hears some children sing a song of how to kill Freddy: by showing him his own reflection. Who were those children? How come they knew how to kill Krueger but had never done so themselves? Where did they get this information? How come Krueger completely ignores their presence? And if the argument is that they are victims of Freddy, riddle me this: how can they be his victims if all of his victims are located inside his skin? Speaking of which, why was Freddy's reflection what set off the victim's rage that ripped him apart? What kind of magic or voodoo did that set off? And is it just me, or does Freddy keep falling to some pretty lame deaths? Like being killed by the power of love in Elm Street 2 or just having his bones get buried in Elm Street 3. ***But, all of that aside, there were a few really nice things about this film. What struck me the most were three aspects of the movie. First of all, the direction was pretty good. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad at all. Renny Harlin took over from Chuck Russell (the last film's director), and I was very pleased with his style. I would even say that in many instances, I was a little impressed. He moves his camera very well, knows how to set up the scenes, and does a decent job with the dream sequences.The dream sequences were, by the way, the second really good aspect of this movie. These dream sequences were whole-heartedly creative and I have to admit I was pretty struck by the visuals at times. In fact, I enjoyed the dream sequences so much, I'd say they rival the ones that appeared in the first movie. The only downside is that while in the first movie Craven put in a lot of effort to blend the dreams with reality, this film makes it pretty obvious what is a dream and what is reality. Still, they aren't bad at all.And the third great part of this movie was, of course, Robert Englund. I don't think I talk about him enough for these films, but Englund does have a great on screen presence, even if his character isn't always written the best. I could tell Englund was having a lot of fun with his role, even more so than in the last two films. So, that effort was appreciated.Still... Those contributing factors was not quite enough for me to call this film a worthwhile experience. The acting was too god-awful, the dialogue was too stupid, and the audience still didn't get enough time to become acquainted with these characters. But, this was not an awful movie, and I would say that if the next film was any better at all, I'd give it a thumbs up in a heartbeat.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
175,HOPSQUIAT,RUNNIN FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!!!!!!,7,11 October 2020,"This is one of the most 80s horror movies ever to come out in the 80s....I hope that makes sense. I enjoy this movie despite its flaws. I grew up on it. Its one of those movies that I like to call a ""beginning of the end movie"" where its not that good, but it isn't as bad as the series is going to get in the future.This movie is far from perfect, but Robert Englund, Alice, and the horror set pieces really hold the movie together. The cast is almost completely different minus a few people left over from Nightmare 3. Tuesday Knight replaces Patricia Arquette as Kristen.As far as the plot, Freddy is back.... thats pretty much it and he has to batt,e Alice because she's the dream master or something.... I can't really explain it.All of the Nightmare on Elmstreet movies are very well made and innovative and this one is no different. The movie is very inventive and Freddy's world always expands and he never disappoints.As far as flaws, there are way too many characters in the movie for no reason and it feels like no one is in the movie for that long. It gets to the point where it becomes Freddy's movie and you don't really care about the characters like we did with Nancy.The soundtrack is dope. I will say that.

I do like Alice she is a lot like me in high school(shy, pretty, and being an ultimate dream master) but Freddy also has an eye on her due to the fact that she is accidentally giving Freddy her friends through her dreams. And that Freddy is getting stronger by the minute. My favorite scenes are the death of Debbie(cockroach nightmare), the classroom scene(geek girl death), and the ending when Alice defeats Freddy using the powers(strengths of the Elm Street kids) against Freddy the one with the souls.

177,sn319,"Nothing New, but Still Entertaining",5,13 December 2014,"With the director of Die Hard 2 at the helm (which isn't really much to brag about, that movie sucks), Dream Master is another pretty average entry in the series. It doesn't do too much new and may focus too much on the characters for its own good. In the last film, the Dream Warriors were interesting dynamically, in this film not so much. The tough black guy is turned into a whining baby when facing Freddy for real, Patricia Arquette is replaced by an underwhelming actress, and the new lead, Alice, is pretty boring as well.Obviously this film had some minor inspirations from Karate Kid or something since there is an insistence on ridiculous, God-awful martial arts action. Some of the deaths are pretty good and Freddy's lines would make Roger Moore blush, which I find somewhat endearing. Freddy has character, making him a more enjoyable villain than Jason.I don't think I've seen a bad Nightmare on Elm Street movie so far. They may be exceptionally confusing at points and really stupid at others, but they are pretty solid B-movies, maybe the most solid B-movie horror franchise I've ever seen.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
178,very_doubtful,Wouldn't scare my grandmother,5,6 April 2000,"Let's get this straight: A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master is NOT a horror film but some kind of teenage comedy flick (reminds me of Scream etc.). The film was a last second product and as far as I know they didn't even have a complete screenplay. The lack of time while shooting this movie and the incomplete story are evident. Ironically, this one did better than most of the other Nightmare-films at the box office.After the enjoyably dark atmosphere of the first three Nightmare-films this one went in a new direction. Suspense and scares are non-existent. The film is (too) colorful which minimizes the suspense. The direction of Renny Harlin is pretty inventive but too restless for this kind of film and that's why the camera-movements create a feeling of rush instead of tension.The acting is below average (except for Robert Englund, of course). It seems that they had to take the first actresses and actors they met to cast the film because of the lack of time. Why else would someone engage Tuesday Knight? Beside this the plot is more like an accumulation of holes and mistakes. There are several scenes in the film where the story jumps from one point to another without anything connecting the two situations.Not everything is bad in this movie though. The special effects are (once again) outstanding and also different from the effects that can be seen in the other Nightmare-movies. Freddy's killing methods are pretty inventive too. The whole film is entertaining but not at all scary.If you want to kill time then you might like it, if not: avoid. Just know what to except.My rating: 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
179,kayrannells,Memorable Characters and Lots of Fun,8,12 October 2020,"After defeating Freddy in the last film, Kristen and her friends are quickly dispatched and her new friend, Alice, takes over for her in fighting Freddy. With each new death, Alice inherits certain personality traits from her friends. Could this movie be trying to tell us that people come into your life for a reason and there will always be little traces of their presence in your life once they're gone? It might, but it's also just a really pleasant sequel in this consistently creative franchise.Some of Freddy's one liners are a bit on the cheesy burlesque side, but the characters are memorable and well played by the young cast and they really get you invested in what will happen to them. Having seen enough teenage horror movies, I can safely say that's a very rare thing in one of these movies.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
180,connorbbalboa,O.K.; an awkward mix of laughs and scares (that mostly fails),6,27 August 2017,"Wes Craven, creator of the original Nightmare on Elm Street, wanted Dream Warriors (Part 3, to which he was executive producer and came up with the story) to end the series for good. Given how Freddy is killed in that film, it would have made sense. But, given the film's almost $45 million box-office gross, New Line Cinema and producer Robert Shaye would have none of that. Only a year later came Part 4: The Dream Master.Here, Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight; yes, that's a real name), one of the survivors from the previous film, is afraid that Freddy will come back and kill her and her friends. After an opening dream sequence, we are introduced to the other survivors of the previous film, Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) and Joey (Rodney Eastman), as well as a new group of characters, with the standout being Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox). After Kincaid somehow dreams of being in the same junkyard that Freddy was buried in, his dog urinates fire all over Freddy's skeleton (an incredibly outrageous moment), flesh and skin reform and Freddy comes back, good as new. He kills Kincaid, and Joey soon follows. Kristen eventually gets offed herself (after a scene with her mother that is embarrassingly acted by Knight), but not before she somehow gives her dream powers to Alice, which I'll explain in a bit. Alice now has to protect herself and her new boyfriend, Dan (Danny Hassle) from Freddy and put him down once again.In Dream Warriors, Chuck Russell (director, co-writer) and Frank Darabont (co-writer) added a sense of humor to Freddy, which was handled well and only slightly presented because of how scary the situations for some of Freddy's puns were for the characters. In Dream Master, that sense of humor is taken a bit overboard. Instead of proper dialogue, the puns and quips just start to feel like puns and quips. The situations that the characters find themselves in during the dream sequences aren't that scary either. One scene has Alice's brother, Rick, facing off against an invisible Freddy in a dojo (he practices martial arts). It's all part of how a character's personality traits or fears are exploited by Freddy (used lightly in the first two films and expanded upon in Dream Warriors). A fight scene in the dojo, however, isn't something that would give people nightmares, especially with the different quips. There is one scene with great special effects where one girl who is afraid of cockroaches has her skin peeled off and is turned into one herself, but again, the quips don't help and the effects make the scene more icky than frightening.On the subject of Alice's powers, when her friends die, she somehow gains their personality traits and dream powers; for instance, after Kristen's death, she starts smoking, having never done so before. In Dream Warriors, it was established that each of the kids had the ability to gain some power over their dreams with the help of special abilities that represent who they are or aspire to be. While in Dream Warriors, it felt inspiring and creative, in this movie, it feels more like a gimmick, especially in the final battle between Freddy and Alice, which is actually well-done and entertaining.Alice is set up to be a resourceful female lead like Nancy Thompson from Nightmare 1 and 3, and Lisa Wilcox does do a mostly good job. Most of the other young actors, however, are quite unremarkable. At this point, it just feels like director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) and New Line Cinema are trying to come up with weak ideas to keep the series going, such as Freddy's resurrection, all of the puns, and the fact that all of the Elm Street kids are dead halfway through the end of the film (Freddy's original mission was to get revenge on all of the Elm Street parents who burned him alive), and yet he still wants more victims.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
181,ShadySovereign,"My personal favorite ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie",9,3 January 2006,"The 4th installment of the ""Nightmare"" movies is arguably the most fun of all of them. Sure, it's not so scary, but it showcases Freddy Krueger's strongest dream powers.The film takes off where the last movie left off, and this time the cute singer/actress Tuesday Knight plays as the character of Kristen (instead of Patricia Arquette, who turned down the ""Kristen"" role that she played in the 3rd movie). After her character gets killed by Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund), the film focuses on Alice (played by the beautiful Lisa Wilcox) after she acquires Kirsten's dream power. As many of her friends die, Alice gets all their unique dream powers and uses them to fight off Freddy.Lisa Wilcox was really good in this movie. She had a beautiful face and orange-red hair, and acted good. And alongside Freddy Krueger, her character proved to be Freddy's greatest nemesis.Alice's dream powers, however, couldn't quite match Freddy Krueger's superior powers. Freddy's powers made him nearly invincible in the face of his enemies, and also added some little humor to the ways his victims were killed (such as eating a guy's meatball-shaped head from a pizza, laughing while being punched in the face, and even sending Alice going in circles when she tries to stop him!). There are very creative deaths in this movie, which is a real treat for horror fans.The only bad part about the movie is that there is not as much blood & gore as the rest of the ""Nightmare"" movies. There would have been much more frightening scenes if there was more blood. Perhaps the filmmakers decided that the main part of the movie was to show how powerful Freddy really is. I enjoyed the movie as it is anyway, despite it having little blood & gore.To sum up, I loved this movie. It really had imaginative ideas and great-looking actors & actresses. I especially loved Lisa Wilcox and Tuesday Knight in this movie. And as always, Robert Englund was great in his role as Freddy Krueger. (As a side note, this was the most successful ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie, since it earned the most money at the box-office) I give this movie a 9/10.P.S: Look out for Hope Marie Carlton (a Playboy Playmate) in a cameo role!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

186,davidhutch007,Freddy back for more.........,6,17 January 2007,"Nightmare on Elm Street 4 was one i was looking forward to because of Brian Helgeland's writing and Renny Harlins directing and guess what i wasn't too disappointed.Kristen, Joey and Kincaid from NOES3 return in this film, they seem to be getting back to normal now that Freddy is finally gone and out of there lives but Kristen feels that Freddy looms right round the corner. Joey and Kincaid on the other hand don;t believe her but they are soon about to. Kincaid has a dream where his dog comes with him and digs up Freddy's bones from the junkyard and after that Freddy return to reap the nightmares of the teens on Elm street once again. We also meet a new character called Alice who day dreams and once Freddy returns to the nightmares she begins to help him kill the others, the problem is she doesn't know until its too late and only she can stop him from taking any more lives.The film is certainly the sequel to number three by brining back the characters of Joey and Kincaid as well as Kristen (played by Tuesday Knight) and this was a very nice touch even if the characters only make the first thirty mins or less of the film, never the less i liked the return of the characters all of whom were played brilliantly by the actors portraying them.Alice played by new comer Lisa Wilcox plays a typical shy teenager who somehow finds herself being drawn into the nightmares of everyone and quickly becomes the films protagonist. I liked her performance and liked what she did to the character but i couldn't help feel that there was something misfitting about her character, but never the less a good performance by the newcomer.Of course it wouldn't be right to comment on the brilliant Robert Englund who again up the tempo with his performance as Freddy. You can be assured that every time he graces the screen he will deliver and you can be constantly assured of this. This film was what i believe the first film in the franchise to really give Freddy the one liners such as ""Hows this for a wet dream"" which you can't help but laugh at and its just pure brilliance from Englund.The story i feel is one of the stronger of the films, certainly up there with NOES 1 and NOES 3 and the writing does feel that thought went in to it rather than a rushed bit of writing and a lot should be credited to Brian Helgeland and the other writing partners on the film who have done a good job in doing something a little different which makes for all the more fun.Renny Harlin our director on this Nightmare certainly adds a music video quality that definitely wasn't there in the previous installments and gives the teen horror feel that the other three installments didn't have either. His direction is good and gives a new and fresh approach to the franchise with his interesting camera choreography and the way the scenes look and feel. This is one of Mr. Halins better efforts! There are of course downsides to the film in that sometimes it's a little confusing as to what is going on and often you feel the director has jumped ten steps in front of you and while trying to play catch up you loose sense of the plot. Some characters feel pointless and i think should never have been put in at all. The films is also full of music from the eighties, rock music that was putting the film because it would grace the films soundtrack and after the fourth time of listening to yet another song its becomes tedious and annoying, even some of the bad horror films do not go out of there way to promote music like this film does.Overall i was impressed with this entry of the series and is in the top three of the series as it delivers a solid story with interesting characters and a new fresh approach to a tiring Freddy franchise.Over all ****** out of **********",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
187,RebelXStar,"When dreaming's all you have, you kinda become an expert",5,13 February 2016,"After the events of the previous movie, the surviving Dream Warriors, Kristen, Kincaid and Joey are moving on and getting on with their lives. Kristen even has a new boyfriend, martial artist Rick and a new best friend in Rick's shy sister, Alice.However she can't shake the feeling that Freddy isn't really dead and constantly pulls Kincaid and Joey into her dreams to share her worries with them. Annoyed, they dismiss her fears only to be killed shortly after, much to Kristen's horror.Realising that she is the last original Elm Street child, she resists sleep until her mother spikes her food with sleeping pills. Knowing she is about to die she accidentally pulls Alice into the dream with her.As her remaining friends start to die around her, even the ones who had nothing to do with Freddy's original demise, Alice realises that she has inherited Kristen's ability to pull others into her dreams and she is now inadvertently bringing new victims to Freddy for him to kill.Alice discovers her dream power is the ability to absorb and take on the powers and abilities of dead Dream Warriors, making her the Dream Master.Watching Alice's transformation from shy, mousy girl into a kick-ass Dream Warrior was one of the high points of the movie as is Tuesday Knight's opening theme song 'Running from this Nightmare.'The Dream Master is the point in the Nightmare on Elm Street series where any horror had left the movies entirely and had become almost entirely dark fantasy. With the exception of Alice, who I feel is a very under-appreciated horror heroine, the characters are there just to be killed off. Despite some creative visuals and ideas, the movie feels very sterile to me and lacks the atmosphere of the previous films.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
188,iSkyWalKing,A.N.O.E.S. IV - The Dream Master,6,29 August 2016,"A.N.O.E.S. 4 is probably one of my favorite from the franchise behind the original for some reason. It is pretty dark and atmospheric somewhat similar to the first. This one starts where the third left off with some of the characters carrying over into this film. Although this is when Freddy becomes a parody of himself and starts to crack jokes on every other occasion, it doesn't necessarily detract from the horror aspect of it. There's nothing fancy or complicated about the plot whatsoever, it gets straight to the point and what you expect, and the characters are silly yet enjoyable enough. The effects and death scenes are pretty hit and miss as has been the case since Freddy's Revenge.... it is a pretty ridiculous movie overall but somehow fun enough where I enjoyed it. I may or may not have a bias towards this film in particular because this was the very first Freddy movie I saw in my youth, which led me to obsess over the franchise as a kid. Then eventually got my mom to rent me the entire series (video store would not rent them to me) so I could marathon them with a friend. So overall it is a ridiculous film that essentially is a parody of itself but still has a creepy somewhat Grind-house feel to it which I enjoyed. This is the one that turned Freddy into a superstar and the franchise went ""mainstream"" from this point on leading to his T.V. show and advertisements etc. This also led to the a major change (for the worse imo) to the appearance and voice of Krueger himself, looking less sinister than before and almost plastic looking. The weakest film of the franchise (Freddy's Revenge) ironically enough has the best looking Freddy of all the films. He looked incredibly creepy in the second installment. Not a great movie but a fun one none the less strangely enough.Pros: pretty dark and atmospheric overall ridiculous yet fun movie Cons:Freddy begins to look more like a caricature of himself, and looks very plastic as opposed to previous filmsthe film & Krueger essentially become a parody of themselvestypical 80's horror flick level of ""acting""underwhelming final act as we've come to expect from the franchise at this pointSoundtrack: 8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

PART 2:FREDDY'S REVENGE was disappointing. PART 3:DREAM WARRIORS kicked so much a$$ on so many levels in comebacks to me. Then writers Brian Helgeland & Scott Pierce and director Renny Harlin gave, for what I think is the most enjoyable sequel in the series.The Dream Warriors may have kicked FREDDY(Robert Englund)'S a$$ in the previous installment, but that just slowed him down. Now he is coming back to wipe them out one by one. Kristen(now played by Tuesday Knight) knows she isn't strong enough, so she gives her powers to Alice(Lisa Wilcox). Now there friend our dying, and the bodies keep piling up. Will they be able to stop FREDDY.For some reason this installment has more energy than all the others. Which explains why FREDDY jumps from being completely scary, to a comic with plenty of one-liners. This also has what I think the MOST disturbing death sequence through out the whole film. Lisa Wilcox reminds me of what Heather gave to Nancy in the first one, a strong female lead, ready to take charge of the screen. Robert as always gives FREDDY another highlight in the film series, just can't see who could play a better FREDDY, if not feel he's gloves.

191,troutman,Tedious and Dire,4,30 April 1999,"When I first saw this film about 9 years ago I thought it was OK. Watching it again recently I could see how dire this is. Maybe it is because I'm not 12 years old anymore and can see this film for the rubbish that it is.This series could have ended with the 3rd and would have been an OK trilogy however Newline just couldn't stop when they could continue to rake in the money.Lisa Wilcox is the only member of the cast then even tries to act the other actors are as awful as the crap jokes that Freddy Krueger spouts for no reason.When the producers made this they could have gone two ways - make a small scary movie like the first or continue the ""big special effects / ""comedy"" that almost ruined the third.

Original, scary, suspenseful, mysterious, and thought provoking, with amazing special effects.  Freddy introduced a new type of a more terryifiyng monster, a killer who is not afraid to show his face and not afraid to speak to his victims.  But, in this film, the third sequel, Freddy becomes more of a lauphing stock, a stand up comedian with wisecracks and jokes spilling out of his mouth at all times.  What has he become?  It's 1988, and now the genre has been overworked.  We didn't - and dont - need another one of these somewhat plotless, violent, and stupid films.  The effects are the only aspect (along with semi-brilliant Englund) that keep this sequential sequel afloat in the great struggle to produce a good horror film.

Just carry it on I suppose.  Luckily they got some of the previous cast in Dream Warriors and had them in this one.  The neat part of this story is the slight comparisons to Alice in Wonderland.  Freddy of course needs new children to kill.  As was established in previous films, he finds an Elm street child to get them for him.  Alice, the unwilling recipient of this honour is terrified that she is practically killing off her friends by pulling them in to her dreams.  At first, she looks tired and scared like other teens in the previous films.

I got a little bit bored till the end but -never mind- it wasn't as bad as part 2. Of course, I won't watch it again.

195,laika-lives,Little Englund,7,17 December 2007,"Some films just don't have a prayer. Ranking somewhere below Chris Farley comedies, Stephen king adaptations and the work of Catherine Breillat in the seven circles of critical hell, third sequels in interminable slasher movie series are, bar pornography, pretty much the lowest of the low. 'Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter'? Yeesh.And yet, down in the dark, wailing and gnashing its teeth, lies a film waiting a rescue that will probably never come. Imaginative, unpredictable and just a little insane, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master' is a near pop-classic. No, really - come back, I'm not crazy! Watch without prejudice and you might, just, see that I'm right.Don't approach this film expecting to be scared. That isn't the point. Frankly, none of its predecessors were particularly frightening, and 'Dream master' throws aside all pretence at mere scariness. By the late eighties, the last thing the world needed was another boring stalk and slash picture milking familiar gory set-pieces. If that's your bag, run along to Jason Voorhees territory, and you're welcome to each other. Instead, 'Dream master' taps into the inherent empowerment narrative of the slasher film and amps it up several notches, filters it through an eighties dreamscape and rams it down the cult of Freddy's throat.There's a genuine and curious sense of heritage running through the 'Elm Street' films, with each Final Girl passing on the baton to her successor - Nancy training Kristen to combat Freddy in the third film, then Kristen passing on her powers to Alice upon her death here. Whilst the deaths of the original final girls of the 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' films feel like a victory for - perhaps even a vindication of - their antagonists, this is never the case in the 'Elm Street' films. Freddy, for all his indestructibility, is continually bested by a lineage of resourceful young women who share their knowledge and skills with one another. If he can never, finally, be defeated, neither can they ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer' owes this film a lot).'Dream Master' recognises this and builds upon it, constructing Alice as an archetypal Final Girl, the equal and opposite of Freddy's evil. The film's master-stroke is her inheritance, upon their deaths, of her friends' abilities - Kristen's knowledge and resourcefulness, Sheila's intelligence, Rick's fighting skills, Debbie's strength and will power. With every killing, Freddy diminishes himself and strengthens his opponent.The wilfully absurdist dream-murders aren't the vapid technical indulgences that more respectable commentators may have led you to believe, but imaginative commentaries on the characters carried off with style and energy rather than technical perfection. As soon as Debbie shows her fear of bugs you think you know how she'll die (covered in cockroaches!) - but the movie is one step ahead, constructing a wickedly funny Kafka homage that is the perfect nightmare for a body-conscious health freak. Even crueller is Kristen's death, ending up in Freddy's boiler thanks to some typically appalling Elm Street parenting (a neat swipe at parents who medicate their children rather than dealing with their problems). The film, like its immediate predecessor, is unusually careful to give some shading to its characters - they may not be fully rounded, but they are oddly convincing as a friendship group, actually remembering to be upset by each other's deaths (another unusual feature of the 'Elm Street' series) and with difficult families that actually ring true by not being overplayed. It all helps balance out Englund's showboating. I've never understood the legions of fans who seem comfortable cheering on a child-molesting serial-killer - really, what's the appeal? His jokes aren't even funny. Wes Craven understood that it was all about the Final Girl, a figure who could survive the mean-spirited ending of the original film, pass on her knowledge, and finally, in this film, blossom into something much bigger than Freddy - a little man who is, after all, just a bad dream.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

However, it wasn't much of any of those. Watching this movie is reminiscent in going to the local fair and anticipating having a blast only to be bored or discouraged by cheesy games and few rides.I enjoyed that Freddy had a respectable death toll in this film. It was probably one of the entries with a higher kill count. And the way Freddy is resurrected is completely awesome. It is without a doubt the coolest way he has been brought back to life.He also has some interesting kills, such as drowning a guy in his waterbed. That was pretty neat as well. Unfortunately though, the movie is doomed with terrible acting. The overall atmosphere and score remind me an ABC After School drama, with a horror theme.

Sure, it trades the dark, disturbing format of the first three films for a lighter, more colorful approach but as least it has a good story.  I loved watching the path of young Alice (played by a great actress named Lisa Wilcox) as she went from a tepid school-girl to a Ripley-like butt-kicker.Set back at the old high school, the film takes out the fantasy gore and replaces it with special-effects that are both gross and silly.  The result: a pop-culture cartoon full of bright, dazzling visuals.

He kills the three remaining Elm street children within the first 20 minutes of the film and Alice is responsible of their deaths because she takes them with her into her dream which is very, very strange and beyond belief. When the three are killed Freddy starts killing Alice's friends. Many scenes are disgusting and never reach the grade of the first movie. At the end Alice is in a church (why?) with Freddy and can kill him by showing him a mirror. Freddy sees his face and dies because all the children's souls which he keeps imprisoned fly away. He disappears. The first movie is much better and also the third one. Here is no real plot,some scenes seem to be far-fetched.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
200,steelcorpfilms,"Not as good as three, but still pretty good.",6,3 September 2001,"A mediocre installment in the `Nightmare' series.  It wasn't entirely bad but then again there weren't a whole lot of good things about it either. Some good acting mixed with some bad acting, a semi-decent story, and good effects, as per the usual for `Nightmare' films.One of the main things that bugged me about this movie was the recasting of Kristen (Patricia Arquette from part 3).  I guess I can understand it, cause I'd imagine Patricia wouldn't really want to get sucked into another one of these movies, but the girl that replaced her was nowhere near as good and didn't really even look like her.  Another thing that annoyed me about this flick was that it killed off all the cool characters very quickly and left the dorky characters.  Englund did well; of course, he's pretty well grown into his character by now and pretty free in it.The story and plot were decent enough, I guess, but coming after `Dream Warriors' it was a far cry.  It just seemed like they were desperate to come up with new ways to kill Freddy.  It also seemed like they were trying so hard to confuse the audience of whether it was a dream or reality that they got confused themselves and then said the hell with it and just kept going.The one aspect that seemed up to par were the effects.  It really must be the part of these movies that they spend the most money and take the most time on.  There's a great reforming Freddy scene near the beginning and Freddy's demise is also really cool.  The only problem is that I don't think good effects can really carry this movie.A mediocre entry in the series.

201,patrick_bateman_90029,"What an Disappointment, Compared to the Earlier Films",8,18 June 2001,"I saw The Dream Master two different ways: First, when I was four years old (it was a TV edit that still gives me restless nights from time to time); Second: when I bought the DVD box set and Nightmare 2 was better than this (and that's saying something). But while I still don't like this film, it has grown a bit on me (but not enough for me to actually like it).I'll judge the film in to ways: Pros and Cons.Pros: - Good acting from Rober Englund (as always) and Lisa Wilcox, who should be getting more work; The makeup here is the best out of them all; The score by Craig Saffan is effective.Cons: - Renny Harlin's direction (his version of Exorcist: The Beginning solidifies that fact); The movie feels way too much like an MTV music video while the first three had a very dark tone to it; While the deaths are inventive, they just really aren't as memorable as classic deaths as Tina's or Jennifer's (well, there is Debbie's death, which brings me to my next point); The cockroach sequence (the main reason for many of my restless nights). That sequence has a long-lasting effect on you that you just REALLY want to get rid of no matter what.If you want to rent The Dream Master, fine by me. It's your money.

Of course, Freddy's back to prey on them and all their friends. This was the most successful in the series at the box-office and you can see why.  It is a pure popcorn movie, complete with the big soundtrack and high death-count; but also packed full of great one-liners.  Helmer Renny Harlin said that he saw Freddy as the ""James Bond of horror"" and obviously wanted him to live up to this by having a payoff line after every murder.   The acting and story shift down a gear, but the entertainment shifts up and its nice to see a return to the suburbs.  This is sort of an interesting article to what teenage films in the eighties were; it mixes the horror, high-school, sketchpad characterisations and cheese-laden music that made the decade memorable.

It's a lot brighter than the other movies and the series continues to get more supernatural a we get along. The leftover cast from NOES 3 are back, with Kristen as the main player in the beginning. Seems she can't stop pulling her friends into her dreams, and they are more than a little sick of it. She warns them that Freddy's back, but they won't listen so the inevitable happens to them. The rule in these movies are that you may think you've defeated Freddy once, but he'll always get you in the end (except if your name is Alice). Luckily for Kristen she has more friends, and one very special one is Alice. She fits the character mold since her mom died years ago, and her father is drinking his life away and treats her and her brother like sh**. She's a big day-dreamer and a pretty quiet girl. The brother is Kristen's boyfriend and mostly a cheerful guy, who just happens to have watched The Karate Kid way too many times. But after he and Kristen get killed, Alice starts to come into her own which is nicely symbolized by her mirror, that at first is covered with pictures because she can't stand looking at herself but when people get killed she pulls their picture off the mirror so she can see more and more of herself. It all leads up to the big showdown, that does fall rather flat compared to the others but fits the movie pretty good, since it's the least brutal of the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
206,catalog,Best of the Series,7,30 November 1999,"Nightmare 4 is my favorite of the series (not including New Nightmare) for several reasons. Not only did it take the series in a new direction that was fresh, but it gave a good foil to Freddy.  Lisa Wilcox gives an admirable performance as the Dream Master who takes on the powers, Mega-Man style, of all the kids Freddy has killed.  She's also damn hot.Renny Harlin also does a good job directing, using his style to inject some much needed life into an aging concept.  All of the acting is a step up from previous efforts, and the special effects are no longer laughable.  Freddy has become more of a cartoon character at this point, but giving him an interesting opponent helps to counteract this trend.All in all, this is my favorite of the Nightmares.

However, Alice was given the powers of the (temporarily) surviving girl from part 3, so she has a chance of beating Freddy!  flaming dog urine? Seriously? Sadly, yes. In fact, I probably don't even need to say much beyond that. However, I'll be at least somewhat more specific.Although how you get any more specific than flaming dog urine Obviously, this movie is not a particularly smart film. In fact, to be perfectly honest, it's just plain stupid. The flaming dog urine is just the beginning. From the beginning to the end, the ideas and writing are truly awful. And not just unintelligent. The characters are totally one-dimensional. Of course, if the actors had at least had a little bit of charisma, they could have overcome this at least enough for us to be somehow remotely interested in what was going on. However, they're almost all not only completely wooden, but lack even the slightest bit of charm. Jones does have charisma and acting ability. Consequently, his role is brutally underwritten and he dies far too early in the film.Of course, Englund isn't wooden, but he's barely given anything to do. Pretty much the only thing he is allowed to do is toss out lame wisecracks.Now, all this crap is well filmed. Director Renny Harlin isn't incompetent. Visually, the movie looks very cool. Not creepy, per se, but definitely cool. The few halfway decent ideas in the script come across well. There is one scene that is incredibly effective due to Harlin's direction: the scene where a girl is tricked into having a sleeping pill and trying desperately to call her friend before she goes. He doesn't actually manage to create a sense of fear, but he does manage to make it look good and occasionally makes it kind of suspenseful. He also sneaks in a few eerie moments.And the special effects are very good. The giant fly bit is very convincing and gross, albeit a dumb idea in the first place. The final visuals of the souls in Freddy's body trying to escape are very convincing.But neither Harlin nor his f/x technicians can make up for the junk they've been given. The series started out promisingly. The first one was a classic horror film. The third was a pretty enjoyable fantasy film. Even the second one at least showed signs of life and sparked some interest. But when this one came around, something was clearly missing. Now, it was only for money. No more imagination, no more terror. Just kill teenagers and toss visuals up on the screen. At least Harlin knows how to do that competently.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
208,mwpressley,I liked it but I'm also a fan. Possible spoilers,7,28 September 2000,"This was a decent sequel.  There were a lot of interesting effects and some memorable one liners.  Quite a high body count and not nearly as menacing as the first three.  Some of the effects were unneccesary and were just eye candy such as the special order pizza.  I do like Lisa Wilcox as Alice and thought she made an intelligent heroine. Thankfully she replaced Kristen whose character was ruined by the replacement in this one.  My favorite scene in this one was the grotesque cockroach transformation scene with the great line ""YOu can check in, but you can never check out"".  A lot of people hate the comical Freddy but he does actually say some funny things.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

And while they didn't really deliver on the story part, I was greatly impressed by the death scenes--particularly the cockroach crush involving one of the female characters. I love the way Freddy plays on the weaknesses and hobbies of the teens (the asthma ""suck the life out of you"" scene, and the Karate-glove sequence) and this installment plays it to the hilt. The characters are also developed enough to make you care about them (sort of), and Robert Englund again returns to don the famous Krueger persona. And although I would've chosen a better lead actress for the part of Alice, I still think it deserves to be held in higher regard than the last two installments.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
212,geno-young,"One of the best sequels of all time, with dazzling special effects!",10,13 October 2017,"""The Dream Master"" is EASILY one of my top 3 favorite ""Elm Street"" films and without a doubt one of the best in the series. It has an imaginative story line with dazzling special effects and extremely memorable moments. It's no secret, the writers weren't trying to be overtly scary with this one; everyone just wanted to have some fun. The first 30 minutes of the film would have to be the most terrifying moments of the film for the simple fact of how serious Freddy was. When going after the remaining Dream Warriors, he seriously wanted them dead, but after that he was all fun and games, and slaughtered Alice's friends and family in easily the most imaginative ways in all of horror. As far as scares are concerned, this is a long way from Parts One and Two, but in my opinion, it is the second best sequel after Part Two; chock full of that sexy 80's vibe that it and Part Two ooze with. Do not listen to the bad reviews, see it and compare it to the rest and come up with your own opinion. This film is charming, funny, scary, and immersive all in one freakishly appealing package. Robert Englund is really great in this one, and although Freddy's classic one line wise-cracks began in Part Three, they really became synonymous with the character in this one. This is the most playful you'll ever see everyone's favorite Child Killer, and to say that you're in for a ride is an understatement. This film is as deserving of the title: ""Horror Classic"" as any of the ""Elm Street"" films are!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

In fact, I can pick out cheesy ridiculous parts better than most people I know.  Even those who aren't fans of the series.Granted, it's not scary like the first one, and doesn't really take itself seriously like the third one, but it has a personality of its own.  My favorite line from this movie and possibly from the whole series is ""You shouldn't have buried me, I'm not dead.""

215,imnotjohncandy,Return Of The Dream Warriors.,9,7 September 2021,"Nathan:Once again I have returned to Elm Street to tackle everyone's favorite dream demon...this time we are going to be talking about Nightmare On Elm Street 4: Dream Master, some of our beloved dream warrior friends are back but we've got some faces including Alice, Rick, Dan, and Debbie. Each of them has some definitive traits that will come in useful for tellnig them apart and also we know what's going to happen to each-of them. While it is not as good as Dream Warriors, the creative kills are still there including the infamous kills that come to my mind...specifically Freddy appearing as a sexy woman in the waterbed, taking out Rick as an invisible ninja, and the most iconic of all...the infamous transformation of Debbie into her own worst fear, a cockroach. Ah, she and Misty would get along so well with their overall hatred/fear of bugs. Unfortunately she doesn't evolve into an Ultra Beast (i.e Phermosa, the cool/oddly sexy roach Pokemon), she basically now can be qualified as a Fighting/Bug hybrid type. That cockroach sequence, you know between this and David Cronenberg's remake of the Fly, I don't think insects will ever be the same for me again. And most infamously...the infamous diner scene where we found out Alice's worst nightmare is to be stuck working at the same place forever and also where the souls go...in a pizza. Yep, the pizza has the souls of Freddy's victims in it, and also most notably...the heads of those victims are meatballs.Remind me never to order pizza from that place again, especially since the last time I ate there I got a severed limb with my order when I specifically said not to, oh well...that's what you get when you hire Freddy Krueger to work there. I personally think hiring Krueger was a mistake, especially since when it comes to delivery. I complained about the service twice and the employees said it wasn't their fault, people are too afraid to ask for delivery because of several Krueger related incidents. Although I question why would they hire a guy who is known for killing people in their sleep. If you want to make sure your customers don't end up dead, why hire Freddy to be your delivery boy especially considering you know what happened to the other employees?Check out this fourth installment of the Elm Street franchise, if you dare, but remember to sleep with the lights on when you go to bed, or better yet don't fall asleep at all.

Why shouldn`t Freddy be sometimes entertaining?The special effects are really up-to-date /watch out for the Freddy`s resurrection from the grave amidst the wrecked cars!/,  however, the logic of the plot is not perfect. Who brought Freddy again alive? The dog? Was it only in a dream or in reality? In the previous parts the plots were sort of heading for Freddy`s defeat, surrender or death. In this one we do not know how the last surviving heroine wants to beat Freddy until the very scene with the little girls` advice in the church. Therefore, it is not so thrilling and ""understandable"".",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

222,MistAh_Justus,Pure Awesomeness!,9,12 August 2009,"This movie is pure 80's awesomeness, I was only born in '87 but I still absolutely love it. The fashion, the style, the hair, the music (Who doesn't do karate while bumping Dramarama(awesome song)), the...comedian. Yes, Freddy the comedian, we've seen a transformation as the series progresses. Freddy still has that creepiness to him, and always will for the most part (if you look at the original), but it's fairly clear to see that the comedy has taken over. The thing is, even though Freddy has got jokes now instead of quick lil' quips, it somehow seems to fit and just work with the whole vibe of the film.The cast is excellent, I would have loved to be on set and a part of it for this one. Maybe it's just me but they really seem like a cool bunch of kids, and I'm pretty sure I wanted to be a ninja like Rick Johnson (Andras Jones) when I was younger, hell, still do. We see the characters from Dream Warriors: Kristen, Kincaid and Joey all return. Unfortunately Patricia Arquette does not reprise her role as Kristen, but singer Tuesday Knight steps in and does a decent job (and an amazing job on the intro song ""runniiiiing from this niiightmare""). The new characters added are a fun bunch, got their clichés but memorable none the less. We got the sister of Rick, quiet and shy daydreamer Alice (played by the beautiful Lisa Wilcox. Possibly my favorite character of the series, besides Freddy of course). Then we have Debbie (the popular boy crazy fitness expert(Brooke Theiss)),and Shiela (the asthmatic bookworm(Toy Newkirk)) and Dan Jordan (the likable jock and friend of Rick, played by Danny Hassle).Freddy is on a mission in this one, as he is brought back by flaming dog pee, with no real explanation, but a quick botched one liner ""you shouldn't have buried me"". Hey, it works for me, Freddy's back! Our former Dream Warriors don't seem to do so well this time around, and since it seems like there are basically two casts, it does make sense taking them out first.We quickly see Kincaid have to fight Freddy in a junkyard, I'm guessing same one as in part 3, but this time around in a nightmare. Kincaid is his usual self, talking some smack before being disposed of. Immediately after, it's Joey's turn to go. While falling asleep Johnny Depp esquire with headphones on and TV as well, the water bed starts to shake and a poster model appears from within it but of course it's really Freddy having some fun before pulling him under. Kristen is drugged shortly after by her mother ""Andelay!"" because she refuses to sleep, it's pretty clear she's a goner. I don't know what was up with the beach scene in Kristen's nightmare, it just didn't seem to fit, Freddy rocking shades while pretending to be Jaws, just didn't work for me. Before being burned alive, she pulls in Alice (remember that dream power she has), to start things rolling for Freddy on the new batch of victims. Luckily Kristen passes on this trait of hers to Alice.It almost seemed too easy, Freddy couldn't kill any of them in part 3, now he's on a hot streak. And now it's up to the new kids on the block to kill him. Quite a mighty task lays before them, and obviously we know which one will step up to the plate. Freddy's transformation of character isn't the only one we see here, Alice also changes, which does work fairly well. As the movie goes on, she gains the power of each one of her friends and Freddy's victims, leading up to a kick-ass battle in the end.There are some only okay kills like the suck-face death of Sheila and the ninja glove death of Rick, they could have both been stepped up a bit, but they still work. Debbie's death, however, is pretty awesome as she's turned in to a cockroach and gets an oozy squash. What really makes it great, is that we see a bit of foreshadowing when a cockroach runs out of her bag of food when she is first introduced while stating ""Ew, so disgusting"" before squashing it.By the end, we got two teens remaining, Alice and Dan who just so happen to be locking eyes throughout the film. It's a race against time as Alice must take out Freddy before he does the same to Dan. I love the scene with Alice getting ready to brawl while clearing her mirror of pictures until she's just looking at herself ""Fuckin' A"". They pick the most perfect place for their showdown, as we see Alice layeth the smacketh downeth in a Chuch, similar to the one in part 5, if not the same one. The final blow works well, as Alice makes Freddy see a reflection of himself which results in all the souls that Freddy has captured come alive and rip him apart from the inside out.We get the perfect ending...Alice ending up with Dan and becoming the Dream Master while Freddy is laid to rest...for now. Definitely a fun sequel, that doesn't live up to the original but continues the story with new ideas presented in a hip way. It's really hard not to like this one, it loses a lil' steam but keeps the series rolling strong.9/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

So I watched 1-3 and I loved all of them; highly recommend them all! But then I get to The Dream Master and I honestly think it may be the worst movie I have ever saw! I was bored! Apart from Kincaid and Joey the entire cast was boring (yes including Kristen as she got recast). And the only 2 characters I actually liked and care about are dead within the first 20 minutes of the movie. I thought the constant Kung Fu-lary was unnecessary in a Freddy movie and oh my god Freddy..
I always knew in the later movies Freddy becomes less scary but in this movie he's just gross and he didn't scare me once.
I don't know maybe I'm being too hard on this movie as I've heard 5 and 6 are even worse, I think it's just so disappointing how 1-3 were really good movies and this all the 4th instalment had to give!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

Lisa Wilcox is excellent in the role where she's allowed to go from shy, mousy wallflower to strong, empowered woman by the end.If you're just in it for the special effects and death scenes, you're also in luck, because this is one of the most imaginative sequels in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

228,Andras_J,Stylish approach to a horror legend turned teen terror,7,7 October 2001,"This review contains spoilers. So only read it if you have seen the movie, or you don't mind hearing what happens in it.This is the 4th instalment in the great nightmare on elm street series and is one of my favourites. It is a great combination of the tension from the original nightmare on elm street movie and the action from the third ""dream warriors"". There was allot of fearful tension building up to Freddy's resurrection in the junk yard, but unfortunately not long after he was just as scary as an Mtv presenter.The movie starts with the 3 survivors from ""Dream Warriors"".  Only now Kristen who was played by Patricia Arquette is now played by Tuesday Knight. Tuesday resembled a good Kristen at times and I have no complaints about her acting, but it wasn't the same.  I think of Patricia as ""Kristen"", Tuesday was more like a new character to me. I still liked her though.Unfortunately all 3 of the original survivors Joey,kinkaid and Kristen die. I didn't like this at all!  At least Kristen should have lived.  The deaths of them make ""Dream Warriors"" look totally pointless. Apart from that they died far to easily, and did very little to defend themselves.  Did they forget there dream powers?  Obviously! Kristen more or less let herself die. The idea of Kristen's death was genius though.  Just when you thought she was going to live her mother spiked her food with sleeping pills.  Before she dies she pulls Alice into her dream and passes her power to her.  The quite and shy Alice watches in terror as all of her friends die.  But with each death she gains a power of them. Alice is the dream master and only she can defeat Freddy and free the souls of his victims. The movie has a great cast!  Each and everyone one of the characters are very interesting.  Unfortunately the movie lacked gore and the deaths were very brief.I think ""Dream Warriors"" would have been the perfect ending to the nightmare series.  However I am glad it wasn't!  Nightmare on elm street 4 is great! The movie screams style and also features some great songs to the soundtrack.  2 very enthusiastic thumbs up!The bottom line is.  if your fan of the series, especially the first and 3rd movie, then this one is definitely for you.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

As always, Rennys style to shoot is quite childish and way too brutal. This is best of his directions I've seen but not quite convincing. There's much more 80's music and dancing scenes (like in Footloose and such 80's musical movies) than any other parts of A Nightmare on Elm Street series. The best part is when nearly every main character from previous movie was killed (because they were quite irritating). Also even the first part was kind of brutal (wich I liked) this one goes too far; its kind of childish. Also plot is quite stupid, Freddy has been buried 3 times before this and even still he terrorizes kids dreams. And his recovering story isn't even good or clever. There is also some lazy things like first deaths; earlier only way you could die in dreams and real life in same time was that Freddy killed you with certain way and then you don't for example burn in real life, your body is just burn but don't burn like you could see it in real life.

The main problem is that the script is only focus on the fx that are really good but forget about the story and doesn't developed very well. We had good character i mean i didn't care too much about the dream warriors but the rest are ver cool character. Well a couple only Rick Alice and Debbie are good character and good actors. The girl who play Sheila i don't like her and i don't wanna start with Dan which his character nothing to do. The music is fine and the most important part here is how Freddy became a clown well there's still a couple of freaky moments just like when he is a nurse but the rest didn't care.

234,Humppe,Horror - as far as actors go,3,29 November 2006,"OK, so Freddy is back, never mind how, that's rarely the point in these kind of flicks. Back too is Kirsten, the girl with Freddy in her dreams. Sadly though, amazing Patricia Arquette from the previous movie has been replaced by horribly bad actress Tuesday Knight. The plot is simple enough: Freddy returns to kill all the teenagers he can get his hands on, including the three remaining kids of N:o 3. When Kirsten dies her ability to draw other people into her dreams pass on to another girl, who of course gets all her friends killed and, naturally, kills Freddy in the end. Nevertheless, this film is the commercially most successful film in the Nightmare series, so you'd think there'd be at least some dots of light. And there are. The directing is very nice from a strictly technical point of view. Director Renny Harlin is a master camera operator and knows his special effects. There are some fairly original killings in this one, such as being trapped in your water bed and being turned into a cockroach. For the 80:ies standard, the FX are well executed and some of the scenes are very pleasing to the eye. Robert Englund as Freddy is, as always, brilliant. This time he gets the opportunity to be really sadistic and humorous. Sadly, this is where the positive adjectives stop. I frankly didn't have the power to watch the movie to the end. It was simply too boring. The actors are all disastrously bad. There is not a single glimpse of light among the cast, and this is the true horror of the film. The characters are pointless and flat, which doesn't help. The plot is obvious and has very little to offer in the way of suspense and the film is in no way scary. It just isn't enough to have a creepy villain who kills people, no matter how good he is (I don't care how many teens he kills, Freddy does save this film). There has to be more to a thriller/scary movie than that. First and foremost, it needs a main character to whom you can relate. You don't kill the star (well...) of the film halfway through and replace her with another character unless you can be 100 % sure that the film holds up to an anticlimax like this.NOES have never been the cream of the crop movie-wise, and this sequel (although a success) does not help. 3 out of 10, not a disaster, but incredibly dreary.Respect the Humpp!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master

236,devoredonna,The 2nd Best Sequel In The Series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,17 August 2013,After the previous installment Nightmare 3 that i ended up really enjoying. Which by the way i didn't like that they killed off Nancy and her father. I thought they should make another great sequel. And they did but this ended up being the last great sequel before the disappointing installments that followed after and i'm only referring to The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead that were disappointments. There never was a great sequel after Nightmare 4 until New Nightmare which isn't really considered a sequel. But this one brings back three survivors from the previous film and they ended up being the first three people to die in the film. And once again Robert Englund reprises his role as Freddy Krueger. I didn't like the replacement of Patricia Arquette too much because she just wasn't Patricia but she did do good as Kristen but not as good as Patricia. As you must know Lisa Wilcox is hot as Alice Johnson a little later in the film but not at first. She's even hot in the next installment The Dream Child. This is one of my favorites of the series and is definitely a must own for horror fans.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
237,kibblesthepig,My favorite Nightmare!,10,28 June 2006,"While this may not be the scariest movie ever made, its still entertaining, even after the 130th viewing. Thats the most important thing to me. By the time the audience gets to Nightmare 4 or Friday 6, they know the rules, they know the killer, so its not likely they will get scared. Might as well make for an enjoyable film with the things they came to see: bodies piling up, their favorite slasher and teens doing unbelievably stupid things that allows them to yell at the screen in protest! The special effects are superb and still hold up, the story continues nicely with the third, unlike the second, which the franchise steered clear from. The surviving Elm Street trio, Kristen, Kincaid and Joey are back and along with them are the most likable characters in horror movie history. See, NOES films were always good about having characters you actually cared about. It makes their deaths more harsh. The deaths, while not all that bloody are some of the more memorable ones. Nightmare on Elm Street 4 is a great edition to the already awesome original and part 3 (again lets not mention the dreaded 2nd film).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
238,Wrontler,Just another sequel that you should watch...,6,30 August 2016,"This one has the same characters of the previous film! Except 2/3 die in the beginning, and the one who is over is played by a different actress...Other than that it was an okay movie. It reminded me of the fist movie, only the deaths were a bit weirder and in total it wasn't as good as the first one. The new characters are your average teenagers who have daddy issues...But that shouldn't stop you from watching at all! I just don't have too much to say about this except that Freddy died, sort of... Since there's 3 more films afte... Wel okay, then he didn't die!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
239,pinheada101,Freddy is back,6,24 March 2003,"This movie is not the best in the series, but the main character, Alice kicked butt. The killings were unique too. Freddy is a character that will never die. As for Tuesday Knight, her acting was very poor, and undermined the whole film. The NOES films are classic.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
240,vwjettaluv32,This was the first Freddy I saw when I was a kid and will always be my favorite,10,21 April 2007,"Its funny how I stumbled on to the Nightmare on Elm Street Serises. I was about 8 or 9 at the time. My father and I had a great relationship. He would take me to a movie every week. I was the envy of all the other kids because he didn't care if a movie was rated R or what. So here I am looking to go to our Friday movie and my dad is looking in the paper asking me what I want to see. He asked me if I was ready for my first scary movie. I jumped for joy when he asked me that. At that time I hadn't really seen a true scary movie yet. Just the ones that where on during Halloween. So off we went me and my dad. I remember how nervous I was because I didn't know what to expect. Here I am 9 years old in the movie line with all these teenagers grabbing there girlfriend waste and making scary faces trying to scare them. I just grabbed my fathers hand very tight and made my way in.Wow! My first scary movie I thought to myself well here it goes. I remember asking my dad if Freddy was real about 10 times during the movie. I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I was in love with horror. I Was Freddys number 1 fan after this movie. I bought all the older movies. I really liked number 1 and thought number 2 was really weird back then. Anyways I love this movie for all the right reasons. There is a lot of gore. A lot of cheesy acting and just plain fun. I am not going to give anything away just go wacth it for yourself. You will love it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
241,SheriffGariss87,People don't know what they're talking about,9,6 April 2010,"The following thing I say is nothing but one big spoiler, so don't read it if you hate spoilers. Again, the following thing I say is nothing but one big spoiler, so don't read it if you hate spoilers. Freddy DID NOT die by 'seeing his own reflection' in the mirror. At the very end, the last lines ever said in the movie are: (after tossing the quarter in the water) Dan: ""So, what did you wish for?"" Alice: ""If I tell you, it won't come true."" It's quite obvious that by the end of the film, Alice is now aware of the fact that she can use her mind over matter. If, in a dream, you can somehow make up your own rules or be able to take away things that have already happened (like how Nancy 'defeated' Freddy in the original), then when would it be your opportunity to use these 'dream powers' perfectly and kill off Freddy before he kills you? The mirror itself reminded Alice of the Dream Master poem, and she was able to have it in her mind and actually Believe that if evil sees itself, it will die. By taking away the fear, he is nothing. If you watch the ending of part 1 and then the ending to part 4, you will see the connection. Nancy AND Alice both beat Freddy with their mind powers, not by a kiss like part 2 or being buried with holy water like part 3. I agree that the movie has a lot of plot-holes, but I would like to clear this one up here and now because it seems to bring this installment down a lot.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
242,transcend_the_rubicon,entertaining cheesy horror flick from the eighties...,10,15 January 2003,"Entertaining little movie and the last good sequel (don't get fooled by the good reviews for Craven's New Nightmare, it was a good idea yet badly executed). Worth seeing for the theatre sequence alone !7,5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
243,colehicks,Probably the best sequel.,8,14 January 2011,"Don't trust me on this because everyone I know loves nightmare 3, but i hate it. Its just something about it. But other than the original, Nightmare on elm street 4 was the greatest elm street ever. Yes, the remake stands up to the original but thats not what I'm reviewing. I highly recommend this one. It leaves off a little bit off of elm street 3. Same 3 characters that live in the 3rd one. But there not the main ones. Freddy knows that the 3 kids from part 3 are the last ones off of elm street. So he takes Alice in 4 and it goes around her in 4 and 5. But the 6 hovers around her child who was also in 5. But after 6, Elm street goes down the toilet with Wes craven's NEW NIGHTMARE. And then Freddy vs Jason which ruined Jason but I thought made Freddy even cooler. And then the remake came to go right on my horror movie shelf next Elm Street 1-4 combo pack.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
244,woodieq,would be better as it's own movie,4,15 March 2006,"OK, nightmare 1,great story,nightmare 2 flowed from the first and happened reasonably, nightmare 3 had a rough beginning but turned itself around with Nancy, but when Nancy and her father are cut you think the series is over. Wrong!!!! nightmare 4 comes out. this movie and its sequel would have been better as their own movies. they do use facts from their predecessors but have plot lines that would have been better with a killer with a different motive, like for torment and pleasure not for the burning of his boiler room. maybe without haunting dreams, he could have just given the kids odd sicknesses or have done a nightmare 3 effect where it appears that the kids are doing it to themselves.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
245,k-konni,"not that bad, if you don't expect a masterpiece",6,6 July 2006,The fourth instalement in the Nightmare Series is easy to look at even if it doesn't make any sense. Actingwise one shouldn't expect something special either but at least it's tolerable most of the way something that cannot be said about part 5. One can enjoy this movie on a pure visual level as director Harlin and his cinematographer are pretty inventive with the camera angles. Of course it's not as good as cravens original but thats hardly a surprise. Compared to the other nightmare movies the level of gore is pretty low which is either pleasing or disappointing depending on ones point of view. Englund enjoys himself in the part and his make up looks convincing enough and the special effects are quite good considering that this is already the third sequel . The movie shows basically one dream sequence after another so it goes without saying that there is no time for character development or plot structure. I always think of the nightmare series as fantasy movies instead of horror movies because everything Krueger does is so over the top that it can hardly be taken seriously. All in all this movie is never boring but hardly a work of art.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
246,thearnie,Freddy's back in the best of the Elm Street sequels,10,5 July 1999,"The funny, creative Nightmare on Elm Street series hits a high point with this installment.  While the series had not been truly frightning since episode one, part four keeps a good balance of suspense, horror, and special effects.  With a strong lead performance by Lisa Wilcox and some new ideas about the Freddy mythology, this is the only truly worthy Nightmare on Elm Street other than the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
247,riotkj,Best a nightmare on elm street movie EVER!,10,12 September 2021,This was the most well made a nightmare on elm street. The acting is alright and Freddy is even crazier. It is definitely better than the 2nd one!,A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
248,warricke,A step down,6,19 October 2021,"This is a huge step down from the previous film, so Lucy of the characters and mythology that was built up in that film just had to be immediately destroyed and discarded in the first act of this one. Very disappointed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
249,juliensd,"Deserves more than an average of 4,8/10",8,26 April 2004,"This is the first elm street film I saw and it fascinated me back then. Of course I was only 10 at that time but it still is great. The flick is not scary like the original, but is more grotesque. Robert Englund is excellent as Freddy Krueger because he enjoys playing that character. You always sense Krueger presence with his twisted nightmares. Dark humor is my taste and I always laugh when he pops his quotes: ""You shouldnt have buried me; I'm not dead!"" ""Now how's that for a wet dream?"" ""Welcome to Wonderland, Alice!"" There are a few things that blows; Patricia Arquette should have been recast as Kirsten Parker and the resurrection is a bit lame but then the S/F effects rocks, the director likes action scenes and the music is well above average for a 1998 film.Definetly recommended",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
250,Tysonko2008,Probably the most fun nightmare,8,31 January 2013,"Nightmare on elm street 4 in my opinion is the most fun Freddy film in the entire series. Sure nightmares 1,2, and 3 were scarier and in a lot of peoples opinions better, but this movie combined a bit of scares with a lot of fun, imaginative kills. The kill count in the movie wasn't as much as nightmare 3, but wasn't as few as 5 or 6. Freddys one liners are funny and you can really see the transition of Krueger as sick twisted villain. He laughs while he's killing you and that's what makes the Freddy character one of my favorite villains of all time. Englund is phenomenal at the role and you can tell he really enjoys it. The soundtrack is excellent as well. Love the song ""don't be afraid of your dreams"" by Go West. The cast is really fun and energetic and Englund himself said that this was his favorite Elm Street film to work on. Wilcox (Alice) was a very underrated heroine. Probably my favorite of all the females. Underrated movie and a ton of fun. If you like a fun horror movie that has a little everything then this movie is for you.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
251,jessysiemons,NOES 4 commentary on the person who found it a bad movie.,10,21 July 2005,"I just think that this part of the NOES series, is just one of the best ever made. I mean , if he stayed only on Elmstreet for the 6 movies, it would get boring. I am just happy that his territory got bigger. And about the resurrection, so what? Haven't you seen the beginning of the movie? Kristen dreamed a lot of that house. And that's why Freddy got resurrected because Kristen BELIEVED that he wasn't dead. It gave him power. NOES 4 is a great movie, the special effects are fantastic and the storyline is OK. It's a classic of the horror movies! I hope that they will make more sequels. I mean , "" A Nightmare on Elmstreet "" was the beginning of a new epoch for the horror movies. So next time when you give comment on a movie, see it with your full eyes and a lot of attention before you make a comment.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
252,nerfaholic,worst nightmare movie in the series,1,29 August 2005,"I'm usually very tolerant when it comes to horror movies, and until recently #4 had been the only NOES movie I hadn't seen, and now I wish I hadn't seen it at all. Within 5 minutes of the movie starting (not including credits), I felt like stopping it. No offense to any of the actors, but the acting was terrible. I was wondering why Patricia Arquette wasn't playing Kristen but my guess would be she read the script and would have wanted to burn it. My main hate of the movie is the plot. SPOILER: The 3 surviving characters from #3 are killed within like 10-15mins of each other and when Kristen dies she gives her gift to Alice and then Alice gets all the souls that Freddy kills? Well that was just totally weird and confusing. As per usual it's Freddy's quotes that kind of save a movie. ""Hey Joey, how's this for a wet dream?"" is a classic Freddy quote but that's still not enough to change my opinion on this movie. Effects are good, acting sucked, storyline sucked, the whole movie basically sucked. 1/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
253,daoust,A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,6,21 September 2005,"Freddy Krueger's back for more in number 4. This nightmare flick is not the worst, but not the best. 2 or 6 are the worst. Now I give info on the movie; sort of a parental review, and sort of just info:Gore: 1-10: 7 and a half This one is pretty high on the gore chart. First a guy get's stabbed in the chest. Gory, but not bloody. The second kill a guy's water bed get's ripped open and he get's pulled in. the water turns red. then his mom walks in the room and pulls off the covers to find him dead, scary a little bloody, but not gory. the third kill a girl falls asleep in class. the teacher turns into Freddy. He walks up and sucks her life out. she turns old and crusty. then she wakes up. she's not old and crusty anymore but she has an asthma attack and dies. The next kill we don't really see, but we get the point that Freddy whacked 'em. the next a girl is lifting weights. Freddy appears and pushed down while she tries to push up, but Freddy's stronger. he elbows rip open and gushy red ooze pours out. then little bug legs come out of her arms and her arms fall off. The bug arms get bigger. She crawls into a trap and all her skin ""sheds"" off. Freddy ends up squishing her. There is also a car crash, and the victim is pretty bloody. And then there's Freddy's premature death. Little heads burst out of his chest, and arms too.Good: 1-10:6 The good thing about this one is that it wasn't just made because Freddy was in it. This one has more meaning in it the some of the other sequel's, therefore giving it a 6.Bad: 1-10:4 The bad stuff: The Freddy flick's are changing from slasher to fantasy, the special effects aren't so good, there's a scene that keeps repeating itself which is clever but annoying, and Freddy get's hit several times in a row, and he keeps repeating a laugh, and that scene seems to belong in a comedy.Profanity: 1-10: 7 Not as bad as some, but pretty bad.Adult content: 1-10: 6 Nudity and someone mentions a rapeActing: 1-10: 8: Pretty good consideringOverall: I'd rate it a 6. Not as good as some of the Freddy flicks, but pretty good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
254,davidwellbaum,A very visual and creative horror film...,8,27 October 2005,"I was actually quite impressed with part 4. In my opinion, the true cores of this series are parts 1, 3, and 4. They are easily the most solid of the flicks. What makes Dream Master so good is the hallucinogenic visual style and buildup near the end of the film. Renny Harlin really succeeded in creating a tripped out frenzy. Having Alice and Dan stuck in a repeating dream near the eerie hospital and diner at the end was quite different than anything we had scene before with the Elm Street movies. And of course, who can forget the bodies punching themselves out of Freddy's body at the rustic church. Props to screaming mad George for his wicked special effects. I also think that the actors (Rick, Dan, Debbie, Sheila, Kincaid, etc.) had great chemistry as the group of terrified teens (something seriously lacking in parts 2, 5, and especially in Freddy vs. Jason). This is one of the Elm Street flicks that NEVER slows down or gets boring; it moves at a very entertaining pace. Too bad this spawned the unbearable part 5....",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
255,jlubas,Another pointless sequel,1,12 March 2007,"Way to go Nightmare 4 in ruining a totally perfect ending in Nightmare 3. This film along with many others (Highlander 2, Terminator 3, and anything in the Alien franchise after Aliens) goes ahead and totally ruins everything the heroes in Nightmare 3(which I believe is the best Nightmare of 'em all) fought for. In the first 10 minutes of this horrible film the kids who survive in the previous film find themselves rubbed out by Freddy. One must ask themselves this question: why? Why is it so necessary that films today have to create pointless sequels? I feel the answer is obvious: money and no art. The previous film, Nightmare 3, was done by Wes Craven a true horror artist. This film on the other hand was done by people going for the built in audience.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 - The Dream Master
