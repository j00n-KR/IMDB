0,MartinHafer,exceptionally powerful drama--but not for the kids,9,15 February 2006,"I really appreciated how those associated with this excellent film refused to pull any punches in showing the life of a young skin-head so ably portrayed by Edward Norton. Instead of creating a caricature of a racist, all the vile language and violence is shown. This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS, but for adults it makes a strong impact--like a right cross into the jaw! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?! I applaud the efforts, though I must also admit it can VERY hard to watch--particularly the shooting scene and the intensely graphic language.",American History X
1,Leofwine_draca,Gutsy and compelling,8,31 January 2013,"American History X is a real surprise, a searing look at racism in America today, told from the point of view of members of a skinhead gang. It's a lengthy film that's punctuated with moments of unflinching brutality, and yet it keeps you hooked to the screen throughout. And the reason for that? Edward Norton. Norton burns up the screen in this film; he's even better than he was in FIGHT CLUB, his big break-out picture. He somehow makes his Neo-Nazi character frightening, compelling and sympathetic in equal measure, a fully realised human being rather than a caricature. Furlong isn't bad, and supporting players like Gould and Keach are great, but let's not kid ourselves here. This is Norton's movie, and he owns it.This film works well because it isn't judgemental in the slightest. It presents all the sides of a situation without ever TAKING sides. It refuses to preach to the viewer, too, which is something to be commended. It gradually draws you into the plot, and for once the many and lengthy flashbacks are more interesting than the present-time story; the prison flashbacks are among the most powerful I've seen presented. It's not quite a perfect film - I'm not too sure about that ending, when it comes down to it, it feels forced and disconnected from the rest of the movie - but it's certainly up there with the best that Hollywood had to offer during the 1990s.",American History X
2,SnoopyStyle,great American cinema,9,2 September 2015,"Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) grew angry after his firefighter father was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a drug den. He becomes a white supremacist under the tutelage of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Along with girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk) and idiot Seth Ryan (Ethan Suplee), he aims to take back the neighborhood from the minorities. He kills 3 black guys who are breaking into his truck and gets sent to prison for 3 years. His brother Danny (Edward Furlong) idolizes him. However, Derek leaves prison a changed man as he tries to get his family away from his past.This is a shocking revealing portrayal of personal racism. Norton is insanely powerful. Furlong does some solid work as the teen with a chip on his shoulder. This is a movie worthy of recognition.",American History X
3,Hitchcoc,So Mind Bending,10,18 February 2019,"Sometimes it's hard, as a viewer, to even watch something like this. It is inundated with scenes of horror and violence. If one simply passes off the idea of doing a movie about the ugliest side of humanity and then put it in our laps. The performances are outstanding and a moral commitment is made. Some would say to the worst of the worst, there is a glorification of the events through flashback that may be seen as sort of cool. This is a small price for me to pay, but I have to admit, I would not do well with a continuous diet of such darkness.",American History X
4,mark.waltz,I don't feel angry. I just feel disgust.,10,26 January 2021,"Is this what has happened to society? I can watch something like this, even being a 20+ year old film, and feel nothing? No fear, no hatred, no sympathy, no caring, just nothing, as if novocaine has been shot into my heart. That's the power of cinema that I don't really want to see but when I do, I am amazed how well done it is. It's not the film I despise. It's that feeling I get of emotions I list above that I just don't feel when I read this in the papers, see on the evening news or on the street, or in this case, see on my TV as a movie.The young Edward Furlong has made a hero (fortunately not a martyr) out of older brother Edward Norton, a skinhead white supremesist who in the opening scene kills two black kids who are attempting to steal his car. It's not the shooting that is shocking. It's the hatred in his eyes as he does it, as if they were his release of anger for the day and he could pump them with lead then go back to bed. After three years in prison, he's on the streets and finds out that Furlong is heading down the same path even though he's not even out of high school, his voice sounding like it's still changing.There's no pointing of finger of right or wrong, of moral judgment from the point of view of the writer as far as I can see. This is what's on the news, documented from what's been on the pages of the L.A. Times for decades. The point of view is that society has become entirely rotten from all sides, that the hatred of all but a certain type of white is acceptable from the point of view of Norton's crowd.Through history teacher Elliot Gould, a conversation erupts with Norton and his family (which includes ailing mother Beverly D'Angelo whom Gould is dating) over the Rodney King trial and riots that shows the differing feelings on the subject, a very intense argument that makes you ask if anything on these issues can ever be resolved. Avery Brooks plays Furlong's principal, a black man unwilling to give up on trying to save Furlong from his fate, and while he attempts to be the voice of reason, is there really any reason left in the world? When Norton rants at Gould in the most anti-Semitic manner, you may feel your gut wrenching up in horror, and it's one of the most depressing moments in screen history.So is ""American History X"" the conversation we're supposed to have? The film is structured in a way where the current situations are filmed in color while the flashbacks are in black and white, and that gives it the feeling of one of Leni Riefenstahl's German pro-Nazi documentaries. It's obvious that sounds like this are meant to be seen when you reach a certain maturity because otherwise, they are often too deeply depressing to watch, and indeed, I can't imagine watching it ever again.But the violence sticks with you, the image of Norton on the street in his boxers with his smug smile being arrested as if he saw himself as a savior of some sort. Once you see this film, even if you never see it again, you'll never forget those images, although as for myself, one viewing was plenty even if I never want to see it again, I have to call it one that I couldn't imagine not seeing. My 10/10 star rating is simply for the way it made me feel, the numbness of the emotions and the way it has made me think about every moment about it afterwards.",American History X
5,classicsoncall,"""Has anything you've done made your life better?""",9,7 January 2012,"I've seen a lot of movies and have seen a lot of violence in them - war films, Westerns, horror and even some of those slasher/gore flicks that go so way over the top. For the most part, the violence depicted is far removed from any sense of reality, because after all, it's a movie and the director can be as unrealistic as he wants to get with flying bodies, severed limbs and the like. However the curb stomp by Edward Norton's character on the black hood in the street was probably as visceral an experience that one can get from simply watching the event on screen. I think that comes from internalizing the impact such a trauma can have if it was personally done to you. It's a little hard to put into words, but I hope you can catch my meaning.What I think the film does effectively is show how a hardened racist like Derek Vinyard (Norton) can slowly come to terms with his prejudices when forced to confront them in a restricted environment. Not only is Derek influenced by his co-worker Lamont (Guy Torry) in the laundry, but also the hypocrisy of the segregated racial groups in the prison yard who break those boundaries for self expediency and personal profit. It's also noteworthy to remark on the character of Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), who foments racism and violence from a safe distance, never forcing a confrontation for himself, but only through surrogates like Derek and Seth (Ethan Suple).If the film does anything, it should help instruct the viewer to rely on one's own life and experiences to see the humanity and good in all people, regardless of race or ethnic background. I'll never understand why racists and haters focus on what's 'different' about others instead of seeing what makes all people the 'same' - a desire to amount to something, be part of a family and have a sense of belonging to a larger community of mankind.",American History X
6,gavin6942,What Happens When People Stop Being Polite And Be Real?,9,2 October 2006,"American History X is the tale of a skinhead (Edward Norton) who ""curb stomps"" a black man and goes to prison. Whiel in prison, he reflects on his younger days and learns that racism is stupid. But when he gets back out, can he save his brother (Edward Furlong), who has followed in his footsteps? Also stars Fairuza Balk, Avery Brooks and the dad from ""Boy Meets World"".This is a very powerful movie because of one thing: its rawness. Raw is the only word I know that describes the intensity of the violence and the prison situations. You won't find this on ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"" (though maybe on ""Oz"").Also, the movie tackles a real world issue: racism. Unfortunately, it does so in a very exaggerated way (not all racists are skinheads), drags in things like affirmative action (which is racial but not necessarily racist or anti-racist) and seems to focus on blacks. In the world of 1998 maybe blacks were heavily discriminated against, but by 2006 it seems that being black is not nearly as bad as being Hispanic or Arab. (Not that blacks are equal yet, but much more so than other groups.) We all know Edward Norton is a great actor (""Fight Club"") and many will rave over Edward Furlong (""Brainscan""). Avery Brooks tries hard to break away from the Star Trek stereotype (but fails). Fairuza Balk is great (at least as good as ""The Craft"", much better than ""The Waterboy"" but not as good as ""Return to Oz""). The dad from ""Boy Meets World""? Don't know his name... he's the dad from ""Boy Meets World"".A great film, but don't watch it with your kids unless they're old enough to understand adult situations. This is ""Schindler's List"" for Americans. Could be a great way to start a discussion on a difficult issue.",American History X
7,lee_eisenberg,Why didn't anyone challenge Derek when he became a racist?,9,12 April 2006,"My 9/10 rating is because ""American History X"" is very well done in every way, except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe, they should have asked him what became of his humanity. Then again, maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation.But other than that, the movie is quite good. Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming a white supremacist, we get to see various issues. For example, when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time, his anger starts to ebb. Good support from Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie, even if they didn't develop it as far as they could.",American History X
8,jboothmillard,American History X,7,9 May 2007,"To be honest I do not remember all of what happens as I got confused with most of it, I just like it for the stars and stand-out moments, i.e. racism, violence, etc. The story is built up with the present day (in colour) and the past (in black and white) with the two brothers of the film, Derek (Fight Club's Oscar nominated Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Terminator 2's Edward Furlong). Basically Derek went to prison for racism and hatred, and Danny is soon following. When Derek's father is killed on duty, Derek's view on mankind is changed, and he finds out in prison there is good and bad in every person, whatever race. Danny now has to be convinced of this newfound enlightened. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vinyard, Avery Brooks as Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as Davina Vinyard, My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Seth Ryan, Stacy Keach as Cameron Alexander, Fairuza Balk as Stacey, Elliott Gould as Murray and Guy Torry as Lamont. I think this is a really controversial film not for those sensitive to race issues, oh, and the fact that Derek is pretty much has the persona of a Nazi German, and the tattooed Swastika. Very good!",American History X
9,rmax304823,Chronicle of the Times.,6,2 September 2012,"I don't think this is ONLY about Edward Norton's shifting attitudes towards white supremacy or American Naziism or whatever the organization is called here. Maybe that was the producers' intent when this was made in 1997, when some of the public were still hearing for the first time about the Aryan Brotherhood and all that.If the object was not just to entertain us but to teach us that racist-inspired violence is utterly wrong, the message seems not to have gotten through. We don't have race riots very often but the country is now polarized and angrier than I can remember, at least since Vietnam. The engine propelling that hatred now is not so much race, although that plays a part, but political ideology. One end of the political spectrum is so consumed by anger that the fantasies on which that outrage is based has come to look as anomalous as Norton's original notions of Aryan supremacy. In some cases, it's downright loco.Norton is a skinhead in an ordinary American family, though he himself is anything but ordinary. He belongs to a group led by Stacey Keach that meets in some kind of garage draped with Nazi flags. Norton's body is covered with tattoos of barbed wire and, featured prominently, a Swastika on his chest. This part of the movie -- the introduction and many flashbacks -- is in black and white.When a black gang burglarizes a house in his neighborhood, one of the gang is wounded and helpless. The shirtless and bemuscled Norton strides over to him and stomps his head against the curb, removing with one stomp all of the guy's front teeth. He's arrested and sent to prison. Norton's actions sound pretty bad to most of us, but evidently not to all of us. Ten years after this movie's release, a Texan named Joe Horn saw his neighbor's house being burglarized by two Mexicans and called the police, who said cars were on the way. Against the instructions of the police, Horn announced, ""This ain't right,"" took his shotgun, went out on his lawn and said, ""Freeze -- or you're dead."" Two men tried to run away and Horn shot and killed them, later to be cleared of any charges.Norton's spell in prison rearranges his attitudes. Initially hostile to the black and Mexicans he is forced to live with, he finally begins to chuckle over a black colleague's absurd jokes in the laundry room. And, with the cooperation of the corrections officers, Norton is beaten and raped in the shower room by whites, in a particularly brutal scene. He emerges reformed and tries to save his younger brother from treading the same path. The scenes after his release from the slams are shot in color.The writing is sometimes rather clever. Elliot Gould plays a polite, vaguely ""live-and-let-live"" kind of Jew who is courting Norton's mother. Over the dinner table, the unregenerate Norton tweaks him about his attitude towards the Rodney King incident and is allowed to make some points. (What if King were white and the cops were all blacks?) The mother tries to put an end to the growing argument -- ""What about some ICE CREAM?"" -- and there follow about 30 seconds of a well-scripted and sublimely awkward silence. But the fight has acquired its own momentum, as combat has a tendency to do. Norton is hijacked by his amygdala and shouts poor Gould down so that Gould must leave the house and the widow he's courting. Norton's extreme attitudes have corrupted his manners at the table and perhaps wrecked his mother's chances for remarriage.I don't want to go on about this. Norton is actually pretty good. The character's attitudes are ironbound but Norton isn't stupid at all. Stacey Keach is a stereotype and is shown as such. When he laughs heartily at some racist remark, the camera practically dives down his throat. I haven't seen so many teeth since ""Jaws."" The writers have been careful to indicate that Norton's pre-prison personality has nothing to do with the Ku Klux Klan -- ""a bunch of illiterate rednecks."" Why not, asks the curious viewer, since the ideologies are almost the same? Well, answer the producers, we don't want to align the KKK with this despicable racist because we don't know how many KKK members are out there but we do know that they buy movie tickets.I really doubt that anyone learned much from watching Norton's rehabilitation or reformation or whatever it was. We can't identify with him. He's too extreme and obnoxious in all respects. We might learn more from a movie about Joe Horn, his killing of two unarmed burglars at somebody else's house, and his subsequent vindication by the courts. I'm sure Joe Horn had good table manners and loved his dog. We can see us in him.",American History X
10,ma-cortes,Outstanding film with a sensational performance by Edward Norton as fanatic Nazi,7,25 September 2011,"This is an intelligent story of racial violence and xenophobia with countless violence and broody message . It happens in Venice , California and deals with a young man , a skinhead and leader of a violent white supremacist gang named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) previously seduced into the fascist bunch by Alexander (Stacy Keach) . The Nazi group follows a racist doctrine about white supremacy , showing the feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments . Meanwhile his problematic family torn apart , specially his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo). He goes to jail after committing a heinous crime , but while in prison Derek's view of mankind is altered, he discovers that there is good and bad in every race . When he is released , the former neo-Nazi skinhead attempts to prevent his younger brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself as Derek must save him from a similar destination from going down the same wrong path that he did . As his only thought is to steer his brother away from that same violent past and being helped by a reformist headmaster (Avery Brooks).Intense and thought-provoking drama with powerful performances and slick direction , being developed by means of flashbacks filmed in black and white and color . It's an important production about racism and Nazism but with lots of violence and unpleasant images as a frightening rape in the prison and the shocking murder at the beginning . Extraordinary acting by Edward Norton who steals the show as fanatic Nazi that committed acts of racial crime throughout and subsequently become good guy . Very good cinematography -specially the black and white fragments- by the same director Tony Kaye . Emotive and moving musical score by Anne Dudley , including some wonderful song . However , disowned by his director and reportedly reedited by its star . The motion picture is stunningly realized Tony Kaye , an unsuccessful director of a few films and documentaries who here achieved his big and only hit . Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable seeing . Well worth watching .",American History X
11,BA_Harrison,X-cellent.,10,2 December 2012,"As a wise person once said (a long time ago): 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.' This proves all too true for Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), whose fear, frustration and rage at the murder of his father by a black gang member twists his soul, taking him not to the dark side, but to the white side—a neo-nazi gang called The Disciples of Christ—where his extremist beliefs and violent ways earn the respect of his peers, but only bring him and his family further pain and torment.Redemption for Derek comes during a stint in prison, his three year sentence for killing two black men giving him plenty of opportunity to realise the flaws in his philosophy and the error of his ways; with help from his African-American high school teacher Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), Derek achieves parole and endeavours to make amends for previous actions, rejecting his right-wing lifestyle and those who endorsed it. But will it be enough to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlobg) from making the same mistakes as he did?It's kind of fitting that, for such a film—one so focused on turmoil, struggle and radical beliefs—American History X is the result of an extremely troubled background itself, director Tony Kaye attempting to disown the final film after star Ed Norton saw fit to re-cut the film against his wishes. Amazingly, somehow, the finished film bears no signs of its tumultuous past, being a nigh on perfect study of the cyclical nature of bigotry, one that powerfully drives home the futility of blind hatred.Boasting many a brilliant performance, wonderful cinematography, smart editing throughout (Norton must've known what he was doing), and some almost poetic acts of violence, plus a powerful message at its heart, this is must-see cinema that makes the viewer think long and hard about what they have witnessed long after the shocking climax has faded from the screen.",American History X
12,moonspinner55,"""Now we can ignore each other in peace...""",5,13 January 2008,"Past and present collage of a youthful neo-Nazi skinhead in Venice Beach, California, his life going into a tailspin after the gang-related murder of his father. After killing some neighborhood thugs, the skinhead serves jail time and is eventually paroled (and reformed), yet he can't seem to straighten out his erratic family, particularly his younger brother who seems intent on following down the same ugly path. Director Tony Kaye puts the squeeze on us right from the start, staging a blacks vs. whites basketball game as if it were Epic Human Drama (photographed in black-and-white, with slow-motion effects and a heavenly choir). The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment'). The jailhouse scenes are the strongest, but the family drama and the sidebars with the police (who also get to make speeches) are uncomfortably contrived. ** from ****",American History X
13,Quinoa1984,The Best masterpiece of it's time,9,19 March 2000,"Tony Kaye's American History X is the most shocking film of the year (especially considering most of it is happening now).  It is violent, electrifying and sad.  But it also is terrific in it's acting, directing and photography.  Edward Norton is the highlight of this film (along with an Oscar Nom.) as the troubled Derek Vinyard, who after his father is killed by a group of blacks is drawn into the Neo-Nazi movement in Venice Beach.  The scenes depicting his time in the Nazi movement is startling, violent, and frustrating.  It really puts the zap on your head.  Anyway, after Derek is put in jail for double murder, he leaves only wanting to save his brother (played well by Edward Furlong) from the same movement that put him into jail.  All through the film, we never feel anything in this movie is less than perfect.  I certaintly didn't, and hopefully you won't either.  Best film of 1998. A++",American History X
14,michaelRokeefe,You will grimace and flinch; but you have to watch.,6,11 August 2000,"This movie for me was hard to watch. It to me was disturbing as FIGHT CLUB. The graphic brutality and violence is probably too much for small children to endure. This is not for the faint of heart. This movie is bold and frank in its dealing with issues such as neo-nazism, bigots, 'skinheads', racism and classism.

15,sunwarrior13,Provocative Film On Racism,10,14 January 2012,"Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America in this film entitled American History X.It tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard and Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard of Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. Both are intelligent and charismatic students. Their father, a firefighter, is murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to extinguish a fire in a South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into the neo-Nazi movement. Derek brutally kills two black gang members whom he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and ideology and how Derek, now radically changed by his experience in incarceration, which includes violent rape by white inmates, tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path as he did. The film is told in the style of nonlinear narrative. David McKenna scripted the film and shooting took place in Los Angeles, California.A well-made, well-acted and often violent film that offers a compelling portrait of redemption and the destructive nature of racism.It is a violent film on a weighty topic.It is brutally honest with its characters, actions, and ideas compelling the viewer to look further and become involved.This jolting film will draw serious-minded upscale viewers interested in cutting-edge fare and the latest outstanding performance by Edward Norton,an amazing actor and a hot-dog whose delight in transformation is infectious.This is a must-see not only for Norton's performance but on how it is interesting and sometimes compelling that it contains more actual provocative thought than any American film on race.",American History X

17,Theo Robertson,A Confused Film,7,14 October 2003,"A Finnish commentator compared this film to American prison drama OZ . I love OZ , it`s my all time favourite American show , it`s compelling and brilliantly acted , adjectives you could use to describe AMERICAN HISTORY X. However while the HBO show suffers from lapses in logic there`s enough going on in different sub plots for you not to notice these flaws but seeing similar flaws in this film you can`t help but notice them
First let me point out the good aspects . As said this movie contains great performances . In real life Ed Norton reminds me of the Kevin character from HARRY ENFIELD AND CHUMS with his floppy hairstyle and his back to front baseball cap but he always gives a good performance . In this movie he gives a GREAT performance as Derek the skin head from hell . Edward Furlong also gives a GREAT performance as Derek`s younger brother Danny . Norton earned an Oscar nod but strangely Furlong seemed to miss out , a pity . Tony Kaye also shows us he had great potential as a director , and it`s one helluva shame it`s unlikely we`ll be seeing either Furlong or Kaye as big Hollywood names***** SPOILERS *****But it`s the script that brings the film down , and in some places it`s quite woeful . Derek kills a couple of armed home boys who turn up at his house and he`s convicted of manslaughter . I know this is a plot device but couldn`t it have been better done ? Is it possible any jury would have convicted Derek for protecting his property from armed burglers . I guess all the jurors were called Goldberg and Rubinstein ? And I`ve got to agree with everyone who don`t buy the idea of Derek making friends with a black guy inside prison even after Derek gets raped by the skin head gang  , oh and how many prisons in America have a mix of one third black , one third hispanic and one third Nazi/peckerwood ?  It`s unrealistic the reasons why Derek stopped being a Nazi but it`s even more unrealistic why he became one in the first place - His Father used the "" N "" word a few times ! Of course the real reason might have been that his Father was murdered by a black gang but if that`s the case then why include the dinner scene ? It`s just confusing . There`s also another confused dinner scene where Derek`s mother invites a Jewish teacher around the family table . Would a Jew want to share a table with a couple of Nazi teenagers ?But the major flaw is with the ending . AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very obvious redemption plot but Danny being murdered at the end doesn`t tie in with Derek`s redemption . If Derek remained a Nazi Danny would have died , if Derek had become a flower arranger with Greenpeace Danny would have died . No matter what Derek would have done Danny would still have been murdered . When writing a redemption plot it`s essential the ending of the movie ties in with the protagonist`s road to Damascus .AMERICAN HISTORY X possibly does deserve to be in the IMDB top 250 movies but not at number 58 . It contains great performances but also some very poor scripting especially poor character motivation . If you want to see a better , more thought provoking film concerning race hate watch ROMPER STOMPER",American History X
18,preppy-3,Excellent but curiously unmoving,8,17 May 2003,"A white supremacist Derek (Edward Norton) is sent to jail for brutally killing two black men who try to steal his car.  Through some harrowing experiences in jail he realizes his way of thinking and living was wrong. He gets out and tries to prevent his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from becoming the same as him...but is it too late?First off I'm giving the film an 8.  I thought is was excellent but it does have problems--it's overlong (I was bored more than once); there's way too many slow-motion sequences; there's disjointed editing; a finale I saw coming from a mile away and an annoying tendency to cut from b&w to color constantly.  Those issues aside the film is great.The script and imagery is strong and graphic (as it should be) and there's some great acting here.  Norton is just superb (he was Oscar-nominated); Furlong is subdued but good as Danny--a lot of his emotions come through in his eyes; Beverly D'Angelo was just great as their mother and Fairuza Balk is frightening as Norton's girlfriend.  The only bad acting was by Avery Brooks--but he's not really a main character so it doesn't really hurt the film.Some of the sequences in here were very difficult to watch (the attack on the store, the prison sequences and the finale) but they're meant to be that way.  This movie hits you over the head with its message but it does work. It just didn't affect me that strongly.  As I said, I saw the ending coming from a mile away so it didn't shock me at all.  Still, it is a powerful film.  Well worth catching.Also there was a huge amount of controversy when this was released.  It seems the director (Tony Kaye) accused New Line Studios of letting Edward Norton into the editing room and cut the film himself (this is no shock--Norton is known as a control freak).  He requested his name be removed from the credits and replaced with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.  He didn't win his request.  If Norton did indeed edit this film--he shouldn't quit his acting job.  The editing here is herky-jerky and the film could easily lose those slomo sequences.",American History X
19,LeonLouisRicci,Dramatic But Disappointing,7,17 March 2013,"This is really a frustrating Movie. It has a lot worth watching but there are some things that keep this from being a great Movie. There is Edward Norton's versatile performance and some good looking Cinematography and it is all in support of a sociological/psychological problem that is forever haunting the American Dream.It is a confusing and only slightly believable, if powerful, story of racism and hatred. People searching for solutions to complex problems and lashing out with unintelligent behavior. Both the White Supremacist and the Black Gangs are equally ignorant and their actions are stupefying.The Film makes a powerful effort for it all to be meaningful, but it comes across as somewhat stereotypical. It is far less insightful than it pretends to be. It is all carried along by the extreme portrayals and the darkly poetic visuals.The prison middle and heroic transformation has the weakest of explanations and is rather shallow. Add to that the overacting of a fat Neo-Nazi and a stilted educator swallowing his lines as if he really doesn't believe anything he is saying, and the Film is rendered interesting but overrated. Worth a look see for some of the strong suits but ultimately superficial and somewhat a disappointment.",American History X

21,Boba_Fett1138,One of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.,10,19 July 2005,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me. As a movie its extremely powerful and important.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American History X
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"After two days, I didn't think I would last a week",10,4 July 2010,"This is the only thing by Kaye I've seen(and the only I'd really heard of), but everything else by him looks compelling. When dealing with something controversial and brutal, you can water it down and appease censors, or you can match it in how relentless it is. In the case of a flawed ideology, the battle can be fought mainly by letting the followers and their actions speak for themselves(this is not propaganda; what we see in this could have happened). That is what we have here. I've read that this was based on a true story; while I don't know for sure, I can imagine that it is. The editing is sharp and vicious, not playing down what we're seeing in the least. Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well. The acting is spellbinding, every single performance. I found myself realizing that I knew these people from other stuff(then again, why haven't I seen Guy Torry in anything else good(steer clear of The Animal)? He's great!); however, they are so convincing here that they disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. Furlong is amazing. Norton ignites the screen as the furious and charismatic Derek. Apparently, he recut this to get himself more time... I don't know, maybe he did; I have to admit, I am rather happy with the released version. The ending is perfectly underplayed, a brilliant pay-off to a subtle setup and an undeniable fact of the problem of racism and hatred(as a sort of spot-on period to a film about those subjects). All of the script is impeccable. The dialog is natural, and the unrestrained feel of it helps paint a clearer image of the types we're following. This is funny at times, and it isn't without uplifting moments(not to be confused with sap or sentimentality); there is light at the end of the tunnel, it's merely dim. The author of this does not have anything other than this to his credit(well, S.W.A.T. was decent)... don't let that fool you. There is a ton of strong language, graphic, bloody and terrifying violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(and a rape) and male nudity, including full frontal in this, and none of it is gratuitous. The DVD comes with three deleted scenes coming to a total of six and a half minutes and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone mature enough for it, and who has the stomach for it(yes, regardless of any other parameters). 10/10",American History X
23,view_and_review,American (Heavy) History X,7,17 January 2007,"""American History X"" is not a weak, fluffy, cutely wrapped after school special on racism, life in the 'hood, life in prison, and breaking the cycle. ""American History X"" is powerful and hits like an anvil. Edward Norton does an excellent job as Derek Vinyard, a venomous, hateful leader of a local gang of skinheads.The movie takes a singular look at a young man who is entrenched in the White Supremist movement, then how he emerged from that life, and even how he started down that path to begin with. Of course most people don't like racist bigots and the movie shows the very ugly nature of the skinheads/Arian Brotherhood. But the movie also shows the interaction between the Whites and Blacks in the 'hoods of L.A. There was by no means an angelic depiction of the African-Americans in this film. A few of the blacks shown were thugs who in part helped shape the views that Derek and his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) held as White Supremists, but there were also a couple of key African-American characters that helped to reshape the views of Derek and Danny.""American History X"" made sure to do it right and make it true to life. The life Derek had before prison, the life inside of prison with the segregation and the gangs, and his life after prison as a changed man. This was no ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""Rosewood"" detailing events of the past, rather this was a movie showing the present, the good and bad in both parties, and the different ways people can be reformed.",American History X
24,evanston_dad,This Film Is All About Edward Norton's Performance,5,21 June 2010,"Edward Norton came out of nowhere in 1996 to deliver a trio of performances (in ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Primal Fear,"" for which he received an Oscar nomination) that left everyone amazed at his versatility. Then came 1998 and his beefed-up performance in ""American History X,"" that no one believed he could pull off and then won him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. I think it's his performance, rather than the movie itself, that people have since reacted so strongly to. He's great, but the movie is a bit of a hot mess.Norton plays a skinhead who goes to prison for a vile crime and comes out a reformed man, determined to see that his little brother (Edward Furlong) doesn't go down the same path he did. But director Tony Kaye doesn't have a disciplined bone in his body, and the film has too much stuff constantly going on to give the story or its actors their due. It also doesn't help that Furlong, whose character we're supposed to be rooting for, is a vaguely unlikable actor who it's hard to warm to.If an actor who on paper looked to be more suited to the role than Norton had played the lead, I wonder if this film would have the cult following it does.Grade: C+",American History X
25,Wuchakk,"Brutal, visceral drama on hateful tribalism and escape",8,22 February 2017,"Released in late 1998 and directed by Tony Kaye from David McKenna's script, ""American History X"" is an urban drama about a former neo-Nazi leader, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from taking the same path of hate he did. Current events are shown in color whereas flashbacks are depicted in B&W. Stacy Keach plays the behind-the-scenes mentor of the neo-Nazis while Avery Brooks appears as Danny's principal. Elliott Gould is on hand as a Jewish history teacher who is interested in Danny's mother (Beverly D'Angelo).During the first half I found some of the dramatics dubious, to be nice; you can tell that kinks needed worked out in the script or the acting. After viewing the movie, I found out that the director felt the same way, insisting that the film needed more work; he also objected to Norton re-editing scenes without his approval and even wanted his name removed from the credits.If you can roll with the palpable flaws, however, you'll likely find yourself immersed in the world of the characters by the second half. While the topic is unpleasant and there are some hard scenes to watch, ""American History X"" shoots for greatness and in some ways grasps it. For instance, there are a few moving, artistically-staged sequences, like the aftermath of the dinner-scene-from-hell and the climax. This is what I look for in great dramas, but rarely get. Norton's powerful performance is another example of the film's greatness.Someone criticized the movie on the grounds that it simplifies complex issues, but how else can you tackle a subject like this and do it justice in a 2-hour movie while keeping it entertaining? Besides, nothing was so simplified to be unbelievable, as far as Derek's character arc goes. Someone else panned the narration, but – aduh – I guess he didn't get that the words are Danny's essay assignment for his new ""class"" with the principal, which explain the movie's title.The overriding theme is that that all races/ethnicities tend to stick together and are in an undeclared war. The skinheads aren't really singled out because the movie plainly shows that their hostilities are mirrored in the other gangs, albeit with different verbiage and accouterments. While antagonistic tribalism is rampant it can't stand in the face of genuine relationship and the corresponding love and respect.ADDITIONAL CAST: Fairuza Balk plays Derek's girlfriend while Jennifer Lien and William Russ appear as his sister and father. Guy Torry is on hand as an inmate Derek slowly befriends while Ethan Suplee plays a hulking neo-Nazi.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles (Venice, Venice Beach, Fairfax, North Hollywood).GRADE: A-",American History X

The story about the two brothers is that is a convicted ex-con who killed two African American men while they were robbing their family home. He gets sentenced to 3 years at Chino prison where he learns to change his racist point of view.The movie is quite powerful and not for children. The black and white scenes are the past and the present is in color. The scene in the prison shower is not an easy one to watch neither is the killing scene. The director shows the ugliness of hate in the family home and in the community. They have a great cast like Avery Brooks, Stacy Keach, William Russ, Jennifer Lien. It's a sad story!

27,Mr-Fusion,"Deeply flawed, but still resonant.",6,21 October 2016,"""American History X"" deserves credit for having an absorbing story to support its penchant for controversy. In all honesty, I approached this movie ready and willing to hate it (hey, I'll admit bias here; when a movie's eye-widening appeal is a curb-stomp scene, what could it possibly have to offer on racism?), but I also remained involved til the very end. This is primarily because Edward Norton's performance is magnet; and even before his post-prison reformation , he still owns the screen, vile diatribes notwithstanding. He is this movie.That said, it's far from perfect, and it's still reactionary to a great extent. That famous scene aside, there are a few pieces of viciousness strewn throughout. Some of it simply didn't work (that scene with the Nazi posters being pulled down from the wall feels very contrived, as well as Furlong's narration), and I can do without the choral singing on the score. The ending feels heap, but could've worked had they not gone overboard with the melodrama.As long as you're not looking for subtlety, this is definitely worth a watch.6/10",American History X
28,whpratt1,Outstanding Film,10,18 October 2007,"This film deals with many problems that have occurred in American History concerning bigotry of all races and how people have dealt with this problem in their own homes and how prison life also separates many races and causes all kinds of problems in those institutions. Edward Norton,(Derek Vinyard) played the role as a skin head Neo-Nazi who took the law into his own hands and killed two African American men who attempted to steal his truck. Edward Furlong,(Danny Vinyard) was a younger brother who loved his brother and followed in his footsteps of hatred. Elliott Gould, (Murray) was a teacher at one of the high schools in this small town and was courting Beverly D'Angelo), Doris Vinyard when Derek got into a fight with him because he was Jewish and showed great hatred towards all Jews, which broke up his mother's relationship with Murray. This film shows clearly how hatred creates problems that this country does not need or any country and it all starts in the home, where bigotry has the early stages of breeding in men and women's hearts and souls.

29,namashi_1,Amazing...,9,20 May 2010,"'American History X' is an incredible film. Writer David McKenna and Director Tony Kaye deliver a message in bold letters, well their message effected me at least. It's a film that has guts and gore... it stands out! Some films entertain and vanish away, and some films remain haunted. 'American History X' is one of those powerful, ""Well-Written"" films that leave you wanting for nothing. It talks about voluntary manslaughter, it's a tale of Two Borthers... it's about complexes, it's about color, it's about the anger within... A Masterstroke!Let me get one thing straight: 'American History X' is not at all meant for the faint-hearted. You need a strong heart to sit through the intense proceedings, and most of all: Should be viewed by those who are 17+ only.Moving on, I found Edward Norton's character highly powerful, it has a life to tell. And the character looks more fascinating and disturbing due to Norton's terrific performance. He showcases himself like never before, and proves that he is indeed one of the most talented and well-dressed actors of modern-era. Edward Furlong also takes this rough journey with pedestrian.On the whole, after watching 'American History X', I just said WOW! If you're a cinema fanatic, then watching this film should rank amongst the top category. Two Big Thumbs Up!",American History X
30,JamesHitchcock,Biography of a Repentant Nazi,8,13 April 2006,"""American History X"" is the biography of a repentant Nazi. Derek Vinyard is a young man from a poor white family in Los Angeles. After his father, a fireman, is shot dead while tacking a blaze in a black area of the city, Derek becomes a bigoted racist, joining a violent Neo-Nazi skinhead group and getting involved in clashes with local black and Hispanic gangs. When a group of black youths attempt to steal his truck, Derek fights back, shooting one of them dead and killing another by stamping on his head. For this crime Derek is arrested, convicted of murder and jailed for three years. When he comes out of jail he is a hero to his former skinhead comrades, but he is a changed man who wants to disown his past and to renounce hatred and violence. His greatest fear is that his younger brother Danny, who idolises him, shows every sign of following him down the Neo-Nazi path.The present-day scenes, dealing with Derek's attempts to lead Danny away from his fascination with Nazism, are shot in colour. Derek's own history is told in flashbacks, shot in black and white. We see him as a frustrated, angry young man, intelligent and articulate, who becomes a monster wholly lacking in conscience. We then see how he is changed by his experiences in prison, and how he comes to realise two things. The first is that blacks are people too, with as much right to exist as he has. The second is that his sterile ideology of hatred has actually blighted his own life, offering nothing better than a jail sentence and the prospect of martyrdom in a worthless cause.I was interested to note that the film's director Tony Kaye and its star Edward Norton later quarrelled about the editing of the film, because it was their contributions which helped lift the film above the ordinary. This could have been just another worthy ""issue of the month"" anti-racist film, but Kaye's direction and Norton's acting mean that it is much more than that. The black and white sequences, particularly the murder and the prison scenes, have a stark, violent power. I have been impressed by Norton in the past in films such as ""Primal Fear"", ""Fight Club"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"", but this was probably the best of his performances that I have seen. In the scenes where Derek is part of the skinhead gang there is a frightening intensity to his violent hatred, and his transformation during the prison scenes is agonising as he realises that the whole of his life has been based on a lie. Norton receives good support from some of the other actors, such as Edward Furlong as his younger brother and Avery Brooks as their black history teacher Dr Sweeney.I was interested by the comments of another reviewer who pointed out that the first anti-racist films in the sixties tended to give idealised portraits of black characters. The example he gave was ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", but there are other examples such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""In the Heat of the Night"". The assumption was that the roots of racism lay in irrational prejudices among the white community which could be overcome by the simple exercise of greater goodwill. There is no such easy assumption in ""American History X"", and no assumption that the problems of racial tension can be overcome by the standard liberal remedies.By far the most eloquent voice we hear in the film is Derek's; the token voice of liberalism is the ineffectual one of Murray, the new boyfriend of Derek's mother, played by Elliott Gould in one of the film's weaker performances. Although some of their doctrines are just simply wrong (such as the idea that blacks have a genetic predisposition towards crime) there is a suggestion that the success of the extremists in winning support is partly due to legitimate grievances among working-class whites over immigration and affirmative action. Derek's reformation is due to self-interest rather than to any conversion to a liberal world view; he realises that following an ideology of violence and hatred has done nothing to improve his lot or that of whites in general.Although Derek is befriended by a sympathetic black inmate while in prison, the black characters in this film are far from idealised. The malevolence of the white skinheads has its equivalent in the violent criminality of the black and Hispanic gangs. There is, in fact, a suggestion that these gangs hate one another and yet are also dependent on one another. The Neo-Nazis rely on white fears of black crime in order to recruit members, increasing black fears about white racist violence, thus enabling black gangsters to consolidate their own power by exploiting the idea of racial solidarity. It is notable that in prison the white racist gang-leaders are quite happy to discuss matters of mutual concern with their black counterparts, while subjecting Derek to a brutal rape for the ""crime"" of becoming too friendly with a black prisoner.The implication is that the responsibility for racism does not lie solely with the white race, or with the black race, or with any other race. Perhaps the fault lies with the concept of ""race"" itself, the idea that humanity can be divided into discrete sub-groups on the basis of physical appearance and that the most important thing about any individual is his or her skin colour. The film does not offer any easy solutions to the social problems it deals with, a pessimism highlighted by its tragic ending. It is, however, an important film, thought-provoking as well as emotionally powerful. 8/10",American History X
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Why can't we just stop hating each other?,10,27 January 2004,"This movie, got to me! I mean got under my skin got to me. It is so effective, the performances were just perfect. We have Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, two fine actors, they play two skin head Nazi racist brothers who are very violent. We start off at a very disturbing scene where we see how Edward Norton's character is put in jail for killing an African American very violently. When he comes back, he has just learned so much that no school, no white man could ever teach him: self respect, respect for others, respect for life, for his family, and knowing that ""We can't live our lives p*ssed off"". He is touched when he learns that his brother's teacher is asking him to write a paper about racism and how it effects today's society called ""American History X"". But when Eddie just gives a wrong look to the black kid in school, some things go terribly wrong.First off, Ed Norton's old ""friends"" turn on him because he wishes not to be part of their very racist gang. Even his own brother who followed his footsteps hates him for turning on the gang. But Ed Norton takes Eddie and tells him his passionate and harrowing experience in prison. Eddie seems to start to see the light, but there is an extremely powerful ending that will make even the toughest guy shed a tear. I highly, very much highly, recommend this movie for everyone. Even for the kids, though you might want to turn them away for a few scenes, but that's how powerful this movie is.

Its main character is Derek (Edward Norton), a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother (Edward Furlong) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked.In jail Derek learns a few things about life, and racism, or more appropriately, himself, and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path.""American History X"" is not a pleasant motion picture. It begins in flashback, as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car. His brother, who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle, witnesses this event. It's a good message about negative influences, along with everything else.Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits. Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton (allegedly) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time. Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits, but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines, which are against the rules of the Director's Guild. He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as ""directed by Humpty Dumpty."" Then, musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema (the film's international distributor) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band. They later wrote a song, called ""NLC,"" bashing the company.Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film, above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline  even if the direction isn't always up to par.Edward Norton is simply superb in his role, showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut (in the Richard Gere thriller ""A Primal Fear""). Norton careens between the role of a raging, vicious supremacist and a kindler, gentler version of the same character; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor.The rest of the cast is good as well  Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles. (D'Angelo in particular, who portrays a sleazy alcoholic  a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the ""Vacation"" movies.) ""American History X"" isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release (mainly from viewers rather than critics, who were less kind)  it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one. The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level, visually, as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Schindler's List."" The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times.But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an (overall) impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay.

34,sddavis63,"Powerful, Disturbing And Often Brutal - This Makes Its Point",8,2 February 2010,"Offering both a very disturbing look at the inside workings of a neo- Nazi skinhead group, as well as a powerful reflection on the redemption of one of its former leaders, this is a truly powerful movie that is both disturbing and sobering. Much to my surprise, it was quite fast-paced and never seemed to lose itself in moralizing or philosophizing, although the temptation was there. The story revolves around an assignment given to a local white teenager by his black principal. The teen (Edward Furlong), whose brother was the former skinhead trying to go straight after doing time in prison, had written a book review expressing admiration for Mein Kampf. His principal (Avery Brooks) assigned him to write the story of his brother, focusing on its social significance. That angle could, as I said, have led to a lot of moralizing. Instead, it served as a springboard to a very powerful series of flashbacks detailing the brother's growing involvement in the movement and his experiences in prison that led to him turning around, as well as a bit of the story of him going straight upon his release. The brother was brilliantly played by Edward Norton. The movie is very brutal and violent at times and is frankly not for the faint of heart. It also seems that a lot happens as a result of one assignment that, as I understood the story, had to be done in one night.Director Tony Kaye made a good decision to film parts of the movie in black and white, which made a powerful statement in itself of the danger of seeing things in simplistic terms. In the end, this isn't a movie that simply attacks the white skinhead movement. It points out the problem of hate for the sake of hate, and, while focusing on the skinhead movement, the point is applicable when applied to black gang bangers or Latino gangs or any other race-based or religion-based hate movement. Hatred is a waste of time and energy - ultimately, hatred is a waste of life, a point powerfully made in the last scenes of the movie. This movie will not leave you feeling good - but that isn't its purpose. It will leave you with an understanding of the pointlessness of living by hate. 8/10",American History X

It all culminates one night when he uses brutally excessive force on two black criminals who try and rob his house, killing them and being sent to prison for a few years. Upon his release, he is a changed man and wants to distance himself from the life he once lead- unfortunately, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) appears to be heading down the same path, getting in trouble with school head master Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) for writing an essay on 'Mein Kempth.' It's a race against time to direct him down the right path.Most of the most respected and well known of actors burst on to the scene with some sort of springboard, some role that gained them recognition and got them tipped as a future star to watch out for. This, surely, was what served for Edward Norton. For his breath taking performance here is the sheer driving force of this amazing examination of the cancer of hatred and the violence and self destruction that evolves. There is a passion and raw intensity delivered from him, that makes it so good it in fact reduces Stephen Graham's crazed skinhead in This is England to a poor man's version of it. That assured delivery and natural screen presence is something he would make himself notable with in future roles such as 25th Hour, although there's probably plenty of others that others prefer. Furlong, Brooks, Stacey Keach and Beverley D'Angelo are solid support but the star of the show is really leading it here.Tony Kaye has delivered an unflinching, shocking, emotionally draining film with a devastating and hopeless conclusion that serves as the real life denounement that there's rarely a happy ending. It set Norton on the path to super stardom and is one of the more shocking dramas out there. *****",American History X
38,ElMaruecan82,Starts as a thought-provoking commentary on Racism and ends as a simplistic Anti-racism propaganda ...,7,11 November 2011,"Tony Kaye's ""American History X"" intelligently tackles the subject of violence and racism and how this dangerous dichotomy is deeply rooted in the social injustices and everyday frustrations endured by American people regardless of their skin. But while it raises very thought-provoking interrogations, it fails to come back with meaningful answers.I concede that the film was brave enough to have a very unsympathetic character as the lead, Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard, a young ideologically disoriented man whose level of hatred and violence is defined by his aptitude to kill and a huge chest-tattooed swastika, and the film was even braver to try to depict his 'moral salvation'. But the film's problem is that both his downfall and his redemption are not treated with the same level of intelligence. I couldn't buy it would take only one rape by a gang of Nazi prisoners and a subplot involving the friendship with a black guy working in the laundry, to redeem Derek. How could the movie be so indulgent toward his racism by reducing it to a sickness whose only remedy was 'to see the light'? If David McKenna's script had the guts to depict one of the most disturbing and shocking (realistic) deaths: the curb-stomping, how did he expect to make a nice guy out of such a despicable character in less than two hours? It took more than three for Spike Lee to make us root for ""Malcolm X"" and he wasn't as cold-blooded and merciless as Derek Vinyard. Intelligence and fast-paced editing are not the most compatible elements for such provocative and promising character studies. Unfortunately, the whole deconstruction of Derek's personality fallaciously shows him more as a victim of racism than the true and condemnable perpetrator of racist acts. And this is a dangerous intellectual shortcut contradicting the idea that we're all determined by acts committed in a responsible way.And Derek sure the hell knew what he was doing as a skinhead leader, yet the film shows him as a good kid with a good heart who let himself absorbed by racial prejudices as soon as his father was killed by black people... and the movie pretends to display a crucial plot twist through one scene where the prejudices of Derek's father foreshadows his descent into racism. The black-and-white choice for the flash-back sequences is ironically fitting because it features the two sides of Derek Vinyard, when he's too bright for his entourage or too violent, in-between, there's an absence that would have probably provided the right answers, or at least, some hints.Take for instance the dinner table scene, probably the most gripping and morally challenging of the film : Derek exposes his views with such confidence that we're tempted to root for the core of his ideas (cleared of course from their blatantly racist overtones). At one moment, Elliot Gould, playing a Jewish professor, even speaks about the persecution of Jews with an irrelevance that almost justifies Derek's point about people from any communities raising the 'Antiracism' flag every time they feel offended in order to avoid self-criticism, blocking any attempt of rational discussion. And then, all of a sudden, as to destroy all the interrogations the scene just constructed, Derek acts like a one-dimensional evil thug, concluding in an anti-Semitic rant against Gould, proudly showing his tattoo.So Derek is not racist with a heart full of anger whose seeds was planted in the field of 'legitimate' frustration, he's just a bright kid who used his charisma and rhetoric to be the spokesman of a Neo-Nazi group. ""American History X"" evokes the manipulative effect of racist theories ignoring that it uses the same rhetoric tricks as the anti-racism : when you can't reply by constructive words, just be offended, and it's made easier when Derek is the offender. I really want to quote Gould asking Derek ""What are you trying to prove?"" That racism is only the way some people choose to ignore their own responsibilities and point their fingers on other communities? That's fine except that this is how anti-racism works too and the whole film is also guilty for having portrayed Derek as a victim of unfortunate circumstances.Should we be indulgent because he lost his father? Should we consider that he got the lesson just because he was anal-raped by the Nazi-men in jail? Are we supposed to believe that the Hispanic or Black prisoners are such gentleman that they decided to give a break to Derek?? What's with the idolization of Hitler by Daniel Vinyard, Edward Furlong as Derek's younger brother? Only a consequence of his admiration for his older brother? So all it would take to fix it is a sweet debriefing from his brother, and a history paper course with a cool-sounding title. The movie is so judgmental toward 'racism' that it should have the decency to depict the limits of blind and institutionalized anti-racist lobbying; then it would have really been ahead of its time.And the ending was another example of a manipulative getaway, the dark tunnel with the light of hope, Daniel gets killed by the very black kid he provoked the day before  symbolically, I would have accepted this death as a tragic eye-for-an-eye response to the curb-stomping, but then I'd like to know –and sorry to insist on a technical aspect- why the director didn't shoot that scene again because I'm sorry, Edward Norton, one of the greatest actors of his generation, wasn't convincing. I even spotted some embarrassing moments where he looked like smiling, and that wouldn't have deserved an Oscar.While it was asking for an unconventional social commentary, with the same intellectual courage as Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" or ""Malcolm X"", this ""X"" falls in the politically correct trap that inevitably patronizes us through its subliminal 'Racism is bad' message, and the movie didn't deserve that, not after such a promising start anyway.",American History X
39,paul2001sw-1,"Watchable, but heavy-handed",7,12 June 2007,"There's a strong performance from Edward Norton in 'American History X', a film about racial tensions; but also some heavy-handedness. The personal development of the characters is depicted in a rather deterministic fashion; Norton's Nazi is far more eloquent than any real-life fascist, while Avery Brooks' teacher is blessed (in a clichéd and patronising gift so often granted to black characters) with unsurmountable gravitas. The direction is also rather obvious, with solemn voice-overs, an over-the-top score, and the needless use of black-and-white photography to differentiate the recent past from the present. While the underlying squalor, and drug abuse, that promotes gang violence, is hardly shown at all. Norton makes it watchable; but it's all rather obvious.",American History X
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"An uneasy, sometimes uncomfortable film that pulls no punches and is powerful because of it.",7,5 March 2018,"'American History X (1998)' is an uneasy, sometimes downright uncomfortable film that pulls none of its punches and refuses to make any judgement on its closed-minded characters, even at the cost of potential audience alienation or possible misinterpretation. Its this very fact that gives it its power because it ultimately allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions, trusting them to understand the separation between the film itself and the contemptible characters contained within. Ultimately, it represents a vehement cry against the racism and bigotry rampant within its first two acts and also holds the belief that someone can unlearn these bizarre beliefs which are usually bored into them by an outside source. If it didn't go the distance it wouldn't have been half as successful, perhaps instead feeling like a weak-chinned exploitation piece, and its tragic conclusion may have lost its impact. 7/10",American History X
41,dromasca,powerful anti-hate drama,9,30 April 2005,"'American History X' is nowadays almost a cult movie, one of the category that seems to get better with the time. This is probably because of the very actual message and the strong story of a family caught in the racial and gangs conflicts of the 90s Los Angeles. The messages that hate does not solve problems and that tentatives to reconcile cannot wipe overnight deep-rooted problems are still strong and universal, and the movie looks as actual as the day it hit the screens.It is also the best movie of Edward Norton, in the principal role of the pro-Nazi gang leader who kills two Afro-American who were trying to stole his car. He is shown the day of his liberation, trying to re-build his life and wipe over his violent past, but meantime he became a model for the racial hate groups in the neighborhood and for his younger brother. If there is hope beyond the violent conflict it's in the tentative of some of the characters to bring some sanity, but the message is open and the tragic end avoids the typical rose water endings of the Hollywood movies.I liked this film, it talked to me length about race conflict, hate, appeasing, forgiveness.

It was one of those films that made me wish it would never end even though is was about two hours long.This is about how a racist guy was sent to prison for a hate murder. When he is released three years later, he must stop his younger brother from following in his footsteps.The acting is amazing. It's beyond me how Edward Norton did not win the Academy Award. Edward Furlong is great as the younger brother. In fact, the whole cast is excellent.The only thing that may turn people away from this movie is the use of excessive racist terms.

44,secondtake,"Gripping and intense, and Norton is fabulous enough to rise above the clichés",7,8 January 2010,"American History X (1998)Well, Edward Norton is so astonishing, and almost scarily convincing, you can overlook a lot of the well worn themes that guide the plot. In fact, all of the acting is strong, especially the little brother to Norton's skinhead character, an up and coming skinhead played by Edward Furlong. The movie is covers basically a 24-hour period, but a good half of the screen time is flashbacks, presented in black and white to great effect. Not only does this help us keep track of what we are watching (the different lengths of hair help, too), but it adds pure style to what is basically a violent crime and prison film. It's fast, well edited, and filled with powerful social imagery and gut-wrenching interpersonal scenes.Crime and prison life form the backdrop for the two main things that give the movie depth. The first is obvious, maybe--race issues between blacks and skinhead whites in Venice Beach. It gets painfully oversimplified, maybe out of necessity in less than two hours, but it works well enough. The second is more important--the love and mutual admiration between two brothers. They are just kids, really, though Norton's role is very adult by the end. Their interactions are the best thing the movie has, and luckily they permeates everything, beginning to end. Clichés in this kind of world might be inevitable in this kind of mainstream movie, but if the African Americans are especially cardboard in their depictions, Norton's portrayal of justified racism really chilling, and the interactions within his family complex and revealing. The other Hollywood plot elements are things you just have to go along with. The kinds of good guys and bad guys, suffering mother and angry sister, the prison culture and street culture, and even the use of guns everywhere are not far from some Italian-American mobster movie, and I suppose that's partly just the truth of it. But it also seems a little easy, a rewriting of a common set of circumstances.Too common. Which is part of the point. You sometimes wish there wasn't a message to every movie like this--American History X is heavy on the moralizing--but the message is a slam dunk. The movie will leave you reeling.",American History X

46,Bored_Dragon,Even amazing Edward Norton could not make me blind for its flaws,7,30 October 2018,"I understand how this film managed to hype the masses, but it's a complete mystery to me how it withstood the test of time and even after twenty years it is considered to be one of the best films of all time. The movie undoubtedly has its qualities, but its flaws are much more numerous and painful.On the positive side, if the idea was to criticize Neo-Nazism and racism, I support that. I also like the idea to make the movie more effective by running the whole thing from the angle of a skinhead. And the strongest trump of the film is that this skinhead was played by Edward Norton. His appearance, charisma, acting skills and the transformation of his character through the film definitely deserve an Oscar, but unfortunately, he was in competition with Benigni's performance in ""Life Is Beautiful"", against whom no one would stand a chance.Furlong's performance is not for underestimation either, but besides two of them, the most of other characters are pale and uninteresting. In fact, most of the film is totally unconvincing, which may be a good thing, because if it already (accidentally) sends the wrong message, it is better that it is not powerful. I am literally allergic to racism and Neo-Nazism and I found myself rooting for Skinheads... Although I believe that the author's intention was to criticize it, the film instead romanticizes the ""white power"" movement. I suppose the purpose of this romanticizing is to show us how it all looks in the eyes of the kids who decide to join it, and that would be perfectly fine if the film showed the other side of the coin equally striking. But if I, in my forties, so easily fell under the influence of this romanticizing and found myself rooting for Skinheads during almost the entire film, I am afraid to even imagine the influence it could have on immature kids with crazed hormones, and that is something I can not forgive. There are many examples, but the basketball game is one of the most obvious. I'm pretty sure we all rooted for Skinheads to win the bet, and even worse, they did. And then follows zenith of believability when black guys quietly pick up their things and leave the court with lowered tails. Yea, sure, in reality it would happen exactly like that.By far the weakest point of the film is the end. I think the idea was to aggravate the overall impression and strength of the film with earthquake tragedy, but that murder in the school toilet was so stupid and unconvincing that, instead of tears, caused my jaw to fall in disbelief. Neither there was appropriate motivation for it, nor would anyone, even wildly adolescent, brought it up in such a place and in such way. I knew that in the end one of the brothers would have to die, but I expected them to get killed out of the passing car as they walked to the school, or through the restaurant window, and I expected the gang to kill Norton as a retaliation for the black guys he had killed. That would be upsetting and make sense. But this toilet murder was simply stupid. And what's even worse, it's not even the original end of the movie. After the toilet murder, there was supposed to be a scene which would somewhat repair the damage made by this ridiculous killing. According to the script, the film ends with a scene in which Norton stands in front of a mirror shaving his head. This scene would round the story perfectly, made it more realistic, convincing and vigorously tragic, but Norton refused to do it.Norton's performance is fantastic and so striking that it is perfectly understandable that it has blinded many eyes and distracted them from all the drawbacks of this film. If you are watching a movie focused exclusively on Norton, you will easily overlook all its shortcomings and experience it as a masterpiece, but I think that, if you watch the film again after reading this review, you will understand what I'm talking about and deprive it of some undeserved credit. Ten out of ten for Edward Norton, but about four or five for all the flaws, some of which I did not mention.7/10",American History X

His performance, along with the whole cast's is one of the many feathers, American History X wears on its hat.Rolled with excellent cinematography & music, it talks about the merits & demerits of racism in America, although it mirrors the plight of whole world. The intensity with which the plot id dealt is extremely appreciable. Good story, which takes the viewers directly into the point. Non-linear narration keeps the pace of the movie fine but it seems intensified towards the end and that shakes the whole film a bit.A very good climax for the story told and in fact, a lesson is being taught. 8.3/10 for Norton, Tony Kaye & the theme.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended due to its boldness & authenticity to real-life affairs.GOOSEBUMPS: YESCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

The messages of cycles of violence, redemption, emotional trauma, racial hatred and broken family bonds are important topics that resonate even many years later.

I was 13 when I first saw the film in 1998, and now I'm 32 with more life experience and many, many more movies under my belt, the cracks and problems with Tony Kaye's tale of brotherly love and neo-Nazism also became apparent. It was something I could never quite put my finger on as a youngster, but the film's main issue is with trying to resolve a lifetime of hate and dysfunction in a single night, and by setting itself such time constraints, over-simplifies an incredibly complex and sensitive subject, although its heart is certainly in the right place.American History X tells the story of two brothers; Derek (Norton), a charismatic and hardened skin-head freshly released from prison following a brutal double-murder, and Danny (Edward Furlong), an intelligent kid following in the doomed footsteps of the older sibling he admires so much. Danny has just written a paper on Adolf Hitler, glorifying the fascist leader as a civil rights hero. His (black) schoolteacher Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) is outraged, but sets Danny the task of penning a paper on his brother, who had walked free that very morning. Hurrying home to reunite with his hero, Danny finds his brother a changed man. Derek has grown his hair, and no longer proudly displays the swastika tattooed on his torso. Something happened in prison that allowed Derek to let go of his misguided hate, and sets about ensuring that Danny doesn't follow the same path by confronting hate teacher and former ally Cameron (Stacy Keach).This impeccably-performed and suitably rough-around-the-edges movie is far more successful with depicting Derek's rise to legend-status amongst his gang than it is with handling his drastic change of heart. Despite a rather silly basketball game, the bulk of the black-and- white flashbacks offer a keen and convincing insight into the mind of a highly-intelligent leader of men who has inherited prejudice and hate. When he enters prison following the shocking murder, Derek becomes torn between the hypocritical Aryan Brotherhood and his laundry-room work mate Lamont (Guy Torry). These moments, which are supposed to convince us that a man of Derek's single-mindedness could learn the error of his ways, are reduced to a handful of clumsily-written conversations and a particularly nasty rape. It ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise, and whether this uneven narrative was the result of Norton being brought in to help with the final edit, causing Kaye to completely disown the film, I couldn't tell you. Despite the glaring flaws, American History X still retains its raw power, and Norton gives a performance of such staggering intensity that he will likely never best it.",American History X

It is true there are some interesting scenes in the first four fifths of the film. But the last part, after the nocturnal confrontation of the two brothers around what happened to Derek in prison goes its own way and leads to a message that is absolute despair. ""What have I done?"" says Derek on the dead body of his brother. He has in fact done nothing at all but exploited a manipulative situation that was rotten from the start and made him the victim of bigotry. But Derek was redeemed in prison. His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school. The two white boys were redeemed. But the black boy was not, could not be and he killed and was unerasably and permanently sprayed with the blood of his prey and the final vision of a completely red Pacific Ocean of forever waxing and waning blood leads to a meaning of fatality that will never end. Racism is forever because the black victims of white racism will never be redeemed and will never forgive. And why should they?

53,eddie_baggins,As powerful today as it was upon release,10,14 April 2019,"Considering the behind the scenes drama (largely that persisted around its director Tony Kaye walking away from the film with its star Edward Norton taking over editing duties and overseeing the final cut), it's incredible just how powerful and accomplished of a film American History X ended up becoming.A confronting, heartfelt and in many ways life-affirming tale of the detrimental aspects of racism and its destructive powers on humankind, Kaye (and Norton's) film isn't an easy watch but these 20 plus years on since its initial release have done nothing to dampen to the effect the film can have on viewing.Starting out by focusing on a terrifying and horrific home invasion gone wrong, then turning its attention to examining the life of Edward Furlong's confused teenager Danny and his older brother Derek played by an Oscar nominated Ed Norton, who are both dealing with a deep seeded racist view that has shaped their lives, American History X casts a wide net as it morphs and moves between situations and scenarios that showcase the best and worst of what humankind can conjure up.In many ways the story of Danny and Derek, as the two brothers reconnect after Derek's release from prison for the murder of two black youths, seems rather simple but through these two viewpoints, we as an audience get to experience a wide ranging set of situations and emotions that refuses to point the finger, rather unblinkingly ask the hard hitting questions while showing us the audience the true eye-opening nature of the hatred that is prevalent in America and the world.In these two central figures we also get a double dose of outstanding acting performances.It's easy to forget that at one stage the now troubled Furlong was one of the industry's brightest stars while Norton was very much establishing himself as one Hollywood's brightest talents, fresh off a memorable turn in Primal Fear and soon to be seen in the ground-breaking Fight Club, Norton is a commanding force of nature in this tale, with his transformative turn as Derek one of the era's most noteworthy lead turns.From our first few encounters with Derek he appears to be a man of few redeeming qualities, an unashamed racist that sees violence as an answer to problems within his community and within his very soul but as we begin to understand Derek's journey and soulful home truth lessons, the true quality of the construction of Derek the character and Norton's unforgettable turn begin to really take shape.With American History X's high placing in many film fans viewing lists, its unquestionably due largely to the fact that Norton so powerfully brought home the films messages through his turn as a young man's troubled path to understanding.Final Say -As powerful and resonate today as it was upon release, arguably even more so in our current climate, American History X is cinema at its most confronting but also at its most powerful, meaning its place as one of most quintessential pieces of cinema is well and truly deserved.5 bags of laundry out of 5",American History X
54,johnnyboyz,Antagonistic and ruffling but all but deeply involving American drama; a forceful and affecting character piece really worth seeing.,7,28 June 2011,"Told amidst a furry of tough flashbacks and present tense broiling drama, through an array of colour footage and black and white hues, Tony Kaye's American History X devilishly explores the life of a Neo-Nazi, both pre-and-post-incarceration, as well as his suffering family in a bare and unrelenting fashion. We dislike the opening of the film, we dislike the opening of Kaye's film on the basis that it is ugly and frank; we dislike the fact that we are challenged to process not only the apparent ugliness of the sexual content but the Nazi infused props littering the screen, and are forced into calculating which of those leaves the nastier taste. We dislike the fact that, next door in a room of his own, is situated a young boy seemingly forced into possessing a building with such a person complete with such activity going on in such close proximity. We side with the boy, and are somewhat forced against our wishes into sympathising with all of those whom inhabit the house when a group of blank, faceless African-Americans plot outside to sabotage the car on the driveway – and all of this before the really nasty bit happens.It is to the credit of those behind American History X that they are able to take the project from these beginnings and to do what they do; the film much more than a freak show unfolding in a cesspool of crudity and violence - the film refusing to allow its powerful opening to act as its dramatic high point, instead allowing the transitions it documents to act as its key source of drama, in what is a pleasurable and really rather involving thriller about changing attitudes and the dangers of influence. Those primarily involved in the opening are that of Edward Furlong's Danny, the boy in his room, and that of his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. They are siblings of the Vinyard family, the pair of them two Los Angeles based brothers. Danny is a high school student; Derek is something a little different, but they share the pain of their father's death, following the falling foul of a black individual, and maintain ties to their mother who's trying to maintain a new relationship.Danny raises eyebrows at school after doing a school paper that is a riff on Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, something which causes great concern amidst his peers. Elliott Gould's character Murray, Danny's history teacher, is worried of the possibility he may follow down a route similar to that of his brother; the verbal outlining of whom shortly follows as the severity of Norton's character is built up, a speech which documents the man's history to do with formulating a national front along with some other radical thinkers that concludes with the fact he is about to be released from prison following a three year stretch. Despite the severity of Murray's outlining, Norton's Derek later appears somewhat chilled upon release; cool at the fact his younger brother has moved up into some echelons more broadly resembling that of where Derek himself was at a similar age. It is a reaction, and whose general behaviour, goes against prior perceptions; particularly when interacting with his fascist friend of old in Seth (Suplee), whom looks up to Derek and half-expects him, along with the rest of a neo-Nazi front that has formulated, to really lead them to where they want to go.Kaye's film will dart back and forth from some relatively tough sequences motivated by hatred and racism to the current tense of reform. Shot in black and white, and holding very little back, Derek's earlier times of violence and antagonism carry with them a cutting, biting aesthetic; a prominent sense of the content always being on the move sewn into proceedings, whether induced by the man's motivational speeches encouraging hate and anti-social behaviour, shortly before the playing out of such things, or the more visually dramatic sequences such as that of a basketball match between two teams that has some high stakes. Derek's post-incarceration exchanges, shot in colour, but still looking as if drained, although successfully coming across as glorious Technicolour in comparison to the rancid black and white, appear calmer; more laid-back and are not motivated by causality as much. Kaye's compositions during these segments additionally appear to open up a little more, allowing for more room to breath and for those of foreign nationalities, or varying other ethnicities, to share the frame a little more – when, nearer the end, Danny is escorted to school by his brother, we notice those of an African American or Hmong ilk milling around in the background, as if invited to occupy the film's frame with the two leads as a collective one such is the newfound sense of acceptance.The film's starker sequences indeed carry with them great adrenaline and a sense of the perversely engaging, the aforementioned basketball sequence one of many that additionally includes the trashing of a local store now owned by some Koreans as well as a grotesquely violent act during the opening. In spite of this, the film maintains such an aggressive and pent-up attitude for the sequences in which Derek confronts his past neo-Nazi accomplices; a lesser film made in a lesser fashion might have, purposely or otherwise, done well, in a negative sense, to fetishise such sequences of hate and shoot the gradual inclination toward a newer order in a drabber fashion. Another instance might have seen the content played safe, a film distancing itself from such sequences of bigotry before constructing the demonisation process in a self-important manner threatening to mutate the piece into some kind of lecture. Kaye impressively, purposely or otherwise, blows through the material in an equal on-both-fronts-fashion; maintaining a dogged grip on dramatic proceedings as controversial content is executed and hate at those the lead previously shared times with is unfolded. Regardless, the film is tough but engaging and worth seeing.",American History X
55,filipemanuelneto,"Overall, and putting aside all the weaknesses in script and direction, it's a very good movie.",8,11 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. Launched in 1998, it remains extremely current and relevant today, in the midst of a world where hatred and intolerance seem to have settled in to stay. I'm not just talking about the Nazis, but about so many others who hate each other for the most diverse and, not infrequently, the most idiotic reasons.The film follows the path of two brothers in the neo-Nazi world: Derek, the eldest, became the leader of the local gang, formed to resist what they considered to be an invasion of their neighborhood by blacks, Latinos and other races. It turns out that he ended up killing, in cold blood, two blacks, and was arrested for it, leaving his younger brother Danny lost and confused. When he gets out of prison, he finds that his brother has followed in his footsteps and is now being indoctrinated to become just like him, even writing an essay laden with neo-Nazi doctrine for a black teacher at his school... but prison changes people, and Derek no longer follows those ideas. Therefore, he decides to collaborate with the teacher and the authorities, and try to prevent his brother from becoming a person as violent and harmful as he is.Directed by Tony Kaye, the film was produced under the sign of discord, with constant fights in which the director opposed the revisions and changes demanded by the actors to their material and ideas. Things got to the point where the director wanted to give up, and see the name removed from the credits! Personally, and after seeing the film, I feel the direction is not safe and the film doesn't seem to know where to go at times. The script, in turn, brings us a powerful family drama and addresses tough, pertinent and current issues, such as the breakdown of the family, local neighborhood communities, illegal immigration, hatred between races and religions. The script even manages to avoid portraying neo-Nazis in a simplistic and one-dimensional way, as fanatical beasts without any humanity, as other films would have done. Even so, it is a simple narrative, sometimes undeveloped, in which some details sound far-fetched. One of the less developed and most important points of the film is the story of Derek in prison: it is inconceivable that such an indoctrinated and fanatical individual could radically change with so little.The cast is very good and, without a doubt, one of the strengths of the film. Edward Norton proved to have made the right choice when he decided to star in this film instead of being just another actor in ""Saving Private Ryan"". The film is perfect for him, and the changes that he made to the material he received allowed him to improve the character, smooth the edges and make the fruit of his work even more mature and juicy. The actor is exceptionally good, I've said it on other occasions, and this film shows, once again, his talent. Next to him is Edward Furlong, a young and promising actor who, as we know, never took off. He's good, and he shows us that, even in a movie where the character is relatively minor in the plot. Stacy Keach appears little, but manages to appear menacing and subversive. Beverly D' Angelo is good, but she got a blank character and Avery Brooks limited herself to what she had to do and her character sounds, well, amorphous and uninteresting. Also noteworthy were the honorable appearances of Fairuza Balk (in yet another slightly eccentric character) and Ethan Suplee.Technically, it's a film with many points of value in its favor, starting right away with a good filming and cinematography job. The use of black and white to differentiate all flashbacks worked perfectly, even though it sometimes makes the film too dark and seems to me to have been overused. The makeup work, particularly Norton, allows him to assume a younger, aggressive and physically tough face and attitude in the flashback scenes, making a good counterpoint to the portrait of maturity and awareness that the actor brings to us after his character leaves from prison. The sets were really well done, particularly Derek's room with all those Nazi props. The visual, special and sound effects work well and the soundtrack, signed by Anne Dudley, sounds good, although it is very similar to thousands of other movie soundtracks out there.",American History X
56,leplatypus,American History X / 10 (DVD),10,18 April 2007,"Definitely one of a few movies that makes me cry: As the protagonists are fascist brothers, you will surely consider me either as a fascist too, either as a stupid man. The truth is that I care a lot for my twin brother, which is also, above all, the exact quality and strength of this movie.If it lifts the veil behind the American Dream, it is by focusing about a ""pissed off"" family. The expression is maybe crude (but told) and it means that they face confusion and fragility. If they live in Venice Beach, it isn't ""Baywatch"" anymore, but violence, guns, gangs. After a death in the family, the brother feels the duty to be in charge and realizes that if a better life comes with fights, the fight against colored people isn't the right one ! Watching (again) this movie now is a perfect timing because what the fascist told there are the same issues that arise in my country for the presidential election. That's frightening because in the movie, those speech are supported with swastikas, shaved heads, while in France, it is told by white collars in suit !!!! But reducing this movie to racial hate would be an error because it offers great insight about the confusing aspect of ""real life"": The big brother is as much physically powerful than he is full of doubts. The more he gets into morals value, the more he gets problems. So, as for every one, the challenge would be: ""What is the most important: a simple life or a moral life ?"". The little brother, as every little brother (like me) belongs to the ghost universe and he only exists in the light of his big brother. ""When people look at me, they see my brother"". I couldn't have said better! My final appreciation would be for the talented cast (all the family, prof Sweeney, the courageous Stacy ""Mike Hammer"" Keach) and the director Tony Kayes, who blends the intense material in a artistic & very moving way!And all this to get only one Oscar nomination for best actor (Edward Norton), my motto would be appropriate: ""I don't understand !!!!!!""",American History X

58,insomniac_rod,A key and influential movie for new generations.,10,3 February 2007,"Among my TOP 10 movies of all time; ""American History X"" demonstrates that cinema can deliver lessons of life. This movie, in the most and best possible Hollywood manner displays a beautiful message for humanity and at the same time, it shows the horrors of how can racism and hatred can ruin the world. This movie can make you cry, make you smile, make you feel powerful, make you feel sad; it's a roller-coaster of emotions and with a strong social message. It will make you think and re-define your ideas for equity and humanity. Maybe I'm praising this movie too much, but I feel that it deserves recognition for displaying a terrible disease in the history of humanity and at the same time, show that races shouldn't be a matter of distinction; the only possible way that people are different is according to their ideas and points of view. We are not different. And as the beautiful quote displayed from this movie ""We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained we must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature"". You'll see who said this when watching the movie...The plot is easy to follow but hard to understand as many dialogs are aggressive but intelligent. For example, Derek's hatred against black people and jews is justified in an intelligent way (OF COURSE IN HIS MIND), and he defends his ideas with strong thinking and based on actual facts. Then, the director adds his point of view when the characters say their moral and political correctness points of view. The situations that Derek lives on jail are breath taking and beautify in different ways. First, he feels like he's home when he meets with Neo-Nazi prisoners ; then he makes friends with a black man who, has an important part in the story because he literally, saves Derek's life and makes him finally understand that people are equal on every aspect. But it's not as easy as that, because his younger brother, Danny is following his steps... Watch this movie as a complex viewing because you will need your full attention and comprehensive abilities in order to make an objective comment about it. I'm sure that this movie is a way to display humanity and unify races.The production values are perfect. The direction is raw but visually stunning. Big budget can make wonders when used correctly and this movie proves it. The score is also excellent, not to mention the perfect and inspiring cinematography. The acting is simply perfect. Edward Norton gives the performance of his life and demonstrates he's one of the most skilled actors of his generation. He's strong in all the sense of the word. The same about Edward Furlong who deserves a lot of recognition for this excellent performance. The chemistry between both actors is touching, moving. I almost cried when Derek finds his dead brother. Beverly D'Angelo also is great and convincing on her role. She's a fine dramatic actress. Avery Brooks almost stole the show with his minimal on-screen time; I want to have a teacher like him. Ethan Suplee, Satcy Keach, Fairuza Balk (sexy!), and Elliout Goul; all of them deliver great performances. They were very compromised with their roles. I can't praise this movie enough, I think it's a dramatic, sad story with a special vibe and a feeling of power that will leave you satisfied but with a special feeling of sadness or power. This is a unique visual experience. One of the best movies from the 90's and probably , from all time. ""AMERICAN HISTORY X"" deserves the best recognition and should be watched by every children on History class. When I watched it for the first time, years ago, I knew it changed my life and my concept for many things.",American History X
59,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A dark, violent, but moving tragedy that dares to understand hate",10,10 August 2008,"""American History X"" is the first film to put more than a name and a face to the white supremacy/hate speech movement and that alone is worthy of applause. This film enters familiar cinematic territory in presenting the tragic nature of the cycle of violence as it relates to social inequality and race, but never before has a film taken the risk of putting us in the shoes of someone who believes in hate. It's a bold move and it delivers one of the more eye- opening films of our time.The film centers around the Vinyard family, whose eldest brother Derek (Edward Norton) is one of the most respected leaders of a southern California hate group, who has just gotten out of prison for the ruthless killing of two black men that were trying to rob him. Prison has definitely changed Derek, but his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) looks to follow in his brother's old footsteps anyway. The film spends a lot more time in the past, with black and white flashbacks showing what turned Derek into the man he became and the impact it had on his younger brother and his family.This is nothing short of a powerful film. It will make you cringe, shake your head, question your beliefs, and maybe even make you cry. Norton is so convincing that when his character makes his case for hate it's scary how logical he can sound despite how the argument fundamentally lacks any sort of compassion or belief in equality. A lot of that credit should go to first time writer David McKenna whose script is absolutely fantastic, never feeling unnatural. It's hard to believe this was original material. Norton, however, deserves a lot for coming off as so convincing and making the drastic change for his character such a believable one. Furlong as the young Danny is also terrific as an impressionable young teen who is both rebellious yet loving and innocent. The supporting cast is also without flaw.It may be hard for some viewers to get past some of the brutality in the film or even sit comfortably through hate speeches, tons of hate imagery, or even just take interest in characters that believe in all that, but McKenna and first-time director Tony Kaye do a tremendously sensitive job of handling the subject. No one party comes off as seeming like more of the bad guy as that is the nature of the cycle of violence. The characters are also so multi-dimensional that you can't justifiably criticize the work that's been done by everyone behind this film.For those curious, the film receives its title from the name of the assignment that Danny's principle give him which asks him to analyze his brother and understand what made him who he is. Throughout the film Danny works on this paper and comes to his own stunning conclusions the same as we do. The structure is so good and so compelling and its a shame the brutal nature of the film and its subject kept it from truly getting the critical recognition it deserved.",American History X

61,Anonymous_Maxine,Edward Norton delivers a staggering performance as an extremely intelligent white supremacist who realizes the wrongness of his views and must then try to prevent his younger brother form going down the same,10,28 August 2000,"American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly. Derek Vineyard's (Edward Norton) transition from a white supremacy leader's protege to a gang leader himself to a changed man is shown mainly through a series of flashbacks to the time before he was sent to prison. The character development and story are amazingly well done, and this is largely a factor of the high quality of the acting. Edward Norton especially, but also Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery Brooks as Bob Sweeney, the African American high school teacher who comes up with the term American History X, and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully hateable Cameron Alexander. Keach, by the way, would have been the perfect choice to play Francis Dolarhyde in Manhunter, the film the precedes The Silence of the Lambs, but oh well. Unfortunately, despite the fact that American History X is one of the best films in years, it is horribly underrated. Much like Norton's last film, Primal Fear, which was also a great movie, this movie did not get nearly the recognition that it deserves.",American History X
62,Vartiainen,Abrupt ending somewhat ruins it for me,7,13 February 2017,"Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a neo-Nazi skinhead who gets sent to prison after he brutally murders the black hooligans that try to steal his car. The movie jumps between timelines following his and his younger brother's lives both before, during and after the prison sentence, as Derek learns to question his commitments to the white supremacy cause.It's a skillful movie, no doubt about it. The non-linear chronology allows us to slowly learn about Derek and see what caused him to change. His younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) also functions as an important character and a message about the cyclic nature of hate. Derek learned to hate from his father and in time taught Danny to hate. Now it's up to him to teach Danny to accept.The movie is also shot really well. The cinematography is brisk and clean, and the numerous black-n-white scenes give the film a style of its own. The non-linearity is handled well and the story is easy to follow. However, the movie does end a bit abruptly in my mind. And on a note I'm still not quite sure whether I like or not. On the surface it seems to undermine the whole message of the film, but on the other hand you could also see it as a final test. Nevertheless, I do think there could have been a better way to end the film, but I'm sure I'm on the minority in this.It's still a great film to check out. Personally, if I wanted to recommend a film about a neo-Nazi redeeming himself, I'd go with Dome Karukoski's Heart of a Lion. But that's a much more obscure film.",American History X
63,robert-temple-1,"Terrifying film about American Neo-Nazis, full of violence, followed by redemption, but nauseating",1,13 December 2007,"It is doubtful whether this disturbing and horrifying film should ever have been made. It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?",American History X

The climax happens when Derek confronts the neo nazi leader, Cameron(Stacy Keach) regarding the recruitment of his brother into the group.

65,freemantle_uk,Oscar-worthing Film,10,22 August 2008,"American History X is in my mind a modern classic, a must see film. It is a social commentary, looking at real relations and the American prison and education systems. It was well written, well directed, but most of all, brilliantly acted.American History X tell two stories. The first is about Danny Vinyard (Ed Furlong), a teenage member of neo-Nazis in Venice Beach, California, as he goes deeper into the crowd. The other story is about Derek (Ed Norton), a young leader of the neo-Nazis who kills two black men who try to steal his car and tell his story of his life in the group and prison. The film starts with a flash back where the Danny see the black men trying to steal the car and tell his brother who he idolises. Danny sees Derek brutally murder the two men before getting arrested. The film then goes to the present day where Danny writes book report on Mein Kampt in a positive way. This obviously gets him in trouble with his school and he is told to write a new report was going to be taught one-to-one by the African American principal Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks). On the same day Derek is released from prison, a reformed man. Everyone in the family was worried about Danny, and don't want him to go down the road. The neo-Nazis try to bring Danny deeper into the fold and get back Derek, but Derek fights this and tells his younger brother everything that happened to him and how his personal ideology had changed.This is a powerful movie and I thought that it was great ever since I saw it on televisions years ago. It tackles touch issues and is brutal in its approach. It is a very well made and a great example of indie film making. It is a shame that Tony Kane has done another film and distances himself from it. Ed Norton is superb in this film and shows that he is a man who loves acting. Ed Furlong is also very good, and Avery Brooks. You see some tough race issues and how the neo-Nazis in California function. It looks at the power struggles in an American prison, and problems in American communities.

The storyline for this picture is brilliantly told with dynamic settings, characters and circumstances. The cast delivers outstanding performances led by Norton and Furlong. The script is very good and the dialogue and intensity is well portrayed. The first half of the movie is very well done and sheer perfection, an easy 10/10.

67,dee.reid,America...,10,8 February 2008,"Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar 10 years ago in 1998 for his performance in 1998 in ""American History X."" His role as Derek Vinyard, a once-bright kid-turned-charismatic-neo-Nazi skinhead leader is one of the most brilliantly brutal and uncompromising screen performances I've ever seen. After being released from prison, he emerges reformed, determined to leave his old life behind and start fresh, and try to make amends to his broken family. As a 22-year-old black male, I was not the slightest bit offended by ""American History X"" and the violent racist rhetoric on display here. A lot of what is said and done in this film can be heard from any right-wing conservative loudmouth (i.e., Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly and Michael Savage, among many others), so many of the discussions here won't be lost on some viewers. The meat of the story gets underway when Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) writes a history paper on ""Mein Kampf"" and is on the verge of expulsion by the school's principal (Avery Brooks) as a result. The principal decides to take Danny under his wing in a remedial history course called, among other things, ""American History X."" Through Danny's work under the principal, in equal parts back-story and present-story, he explores Derek's transformation into a skinhead, after coming under the influence of a local white supremacist, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), following the murder of their father (though the seeds were planted much earlier, as detailed fairly late in the film), and Derek becomes his protégé, recruiting many lost and impressionable young kids for him. Britisher Tony Kaye directed David McKenna's occasionally flawed script, which guides Norton's Derek Vinyard through a devastating and vicious cycle that is as brilliant as it is chilling and realistic. The transformation he goes through in this film, and his attempts to keep Danny from following in his footsteps is indeed one of the greatest screen performances of all time, even if some issues get left out in the cold, and the script seems deficient in the storytelling at times. But regardless, ""American History X,"" is just one damn-brilliant piece of film-making. The intensity of the performances, especially Edward Norton's, and the material show us that this is film-making at its best. One of the all-time greatest films.10/10",American History X

The fruit of hatred is pain, suffering and great loss. Contrary to this, love leads to hope, joy and fulfillment.Edward Norton is as good as you have heard. He is fantastic in all facets of this complex role, and his performance is no less than a tour-de-force. Edward Furlong has come of age too, with his portrayal of the little brother who idolises everything his big brother has become. The story, about Neo-Nazis and their reign of terror in Los Angeles, is a fictional dramatisation of what is a very real problem.

Well, yes.  He's in prison.  Other people at other times have been put in prison for waging battles they believed to be just; sometimes, the battles WERE just.  We wouldn't have wanted Hitler's opponents, for instance, to give up and go with the flow, just because that would have made their lives easier - would we?Moreover, Danny's racism had intellectual grounds.  When he goes into his rants he offers reasons - honest to goodness reasons - why others should believe what he believes.  Does anyone ever offer him or us opposing reasons?  Not that I noticed; instead, they look at him as they'd look at someone who spoke out of turn in church.  Those who agree with Danny will feel cheated, with reason; those who disagree will (or ought) feel even more cheated, with even greater reason.I haven't given you the full story.  While he's in prison, Danny actually MEETS a black man, for the first time in his life.  He changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevents the film from being infuriating.  As drama, it's distinctly so so.

I have seen them all from De Niro in Taxi Driver to Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. None, and I mean none of these performances are quite as good as Edward Norton in this. This movie is about Norton who is a reformed skinhead who tries to prevent his little brother (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. One thing great is how big of a shock Norton was. Norton is a geek: his name, face and voice are all proof. But he is far from a geek in this. There are 3 Nortons: a nice high school kid, a monstrous neo-Nazi and reformed gentleman, all of which he does so convincingly with such passion that connects deep within the viewer's soul. The kid he plays is so nice and innocent. The monster he plays is so angry, frustrated and full of boiling hatred. This stage is the most intense acting I have ever seen too. The anger, intensity and apathy can make the viewers very uncomfortable. Yet, he is so well developed that you have no choice but to sympathize him. An actor has done a job well done if he can push the buttons of a viewer. The reformed man he plays is heroic and so philosophical that the viewer will love him. What really sets this performance apart are the transitions from his character's stages. It is during the transition that where the themes of the story are shown. Sure he is only briefly a regular high school kid, but going from a racist monster to someone reformed was so perfect. It is done in such a smooth and gradual flow that is unlike any other chemistry for a single character. Other great pieces of chemistry for a single character don't flow at a gradual pace like this.I think that this is one of the greatest movies in history that deserves high ranking on many lists. The acting by Norton is better than everybody else's, and it also has a strong delivery of an important message. These kinds of movies have the biggest impacts on viewers. I found this to be the 90's version of Raging Bull. Both contain intense acting be the main characters who are fuelled by extreme anger and personal demons who find out that hate is wrong and a waste of time. What makes this better is Norton's performance and the message being clearer.4/4",American History X
78,raulfaust,Half American History X,6,30 October 2011,"Brazilian's synopsis made me have a wrong idea about this film. Based on that, one expects it to be a deeply analysis of a prisoner's life. Sadly, this film is situated in jail for only some few minutes, I believe less than half an hour, which frustrated me. The whole concept is very interesting, a neo-nazi skinhead realizes all the prejudices he believed in are completely junk. I thought Derek (Edward Norton) would become good friends with some black guys and understand they're all the same, but he just shares a laugh or two with one black guy and that's it, no big thing. Also, I found Norton's acting to be kinda weak, specially when he's ""crying"" in the last minutes. He ""cries"" and not a single tear falls from his eyes.All in all, I believe this is a good concept with a not so rich execution. If you want to see a strong film about prejudice and racism, watch ""A Time To Kill"".",American History X
79,eric262003,Excellent Story With a Gripping Subject Matter Letdown By a Rushed Script,8,23 September 2013,"There is no disputing that this movie is heavy-set on trying to unravel a message that both very provocative and also very powerful. The ever painful subject of racism whether it's educated or from the street, philosophical from the words of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), this movie will surely leave you with many thoughts popping through your mind once this movie is over.""American History X"" is a without a doubt one of the most important movies that was released in the late 1990's. Once the smoke is cleared and everyone leaves the theatre, people will look back on it whether they liked the movie or they hated it, there is no doubt that Norton's performance will surely be further discussed. To me he was already a star when he was in ""Primal Fear"" and sadly was robbed of an Oscar in that performance. The amazing versatility never ceases to amaze me the way Norton's went through to portray at one hand, a scary, fearsome Nazi skinhead complete with ripped muscles, a bald head, with a swastika branded on his heart, and yet behind his menacing appearance lies a saddened, confused lonely soul who's personal mission was to rectify from his erroneous ways. He is described as a very bright young man with bad intentions and hatred bottled up inside of him from the things he learned from his ethnic-hating late father and his constant struggle to find the real meaning of life.Eternally grief-stricken from a disjointed family, Derek's father's death lured Derek into the realms of Nazism it is quite original that the setting of this movie does not emanate from the South, but rather Venice Beach as a backdrop where hate crimes are quite frequent and rallies to play as Derek serves as the orator for these rallies to promote white supremacy.The turning point of the movie comes when two African-Americans try to steal Derek's car. Derek clad in only his underwear chases the men with a gun and mercilessly kills them both. Sure the scene was cold and graphic and not for the weak at heart, but when the police arrive, Derek is just standing there with a cold and evil grimace on his face, complete with a haunting musical score in the background. As this scene is happening, Derek is seen staring at his young brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who was a witness to the whole incident. Danny looks on at his brother who shows absolute no remorse for his actions, standing like a proud soldier who dished out justice his way. These brutal scenes are some of the most astounding scenes you will ever find on film. These scenes alone sells this movie successfully which is more I can say for the other very rushed and not very to the point scenes. Derek's prison time could have covered more ground, but this movie tried to cover too much details with very limited time.Excellent direction by Tony Kaye to highlight the past in black and white and color for the present events after Derek's discharge from prison. The execution is handled simplistic but brilliant as Derek finally home takes a hot shower for the first time in while, looks at himself and the branded swastika situated at his heart. His newly discovered shame his brought him to the point of rethinking all the bad things he's done as he covers the symbol of hate in his heart. Deep inside his heart, he looks back with regret and sorrow and rediscovery to find out what he could have done and what he can do to move forward in this new path of life he sets for himself. In spite of the often rushed script and some details that were left behind, ""American History X"" is a powerful film that must be seen first before it can be judged.",American History X
80,gangstahippie,Excellent movie!,9,29 September 2008,"American History X is a very powerful film about neo-nazism and racism in general.The acting is all around very good.I am used to seeing Ethan Suplee in comedy films, but this is his first dramatic role if I am not mistaken, he does a great job as well as Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Stacy Keach & Beverly D'Angelo.The movie is about an intelligent young man who'se father gets killed during a drive-by shooting while putting out a fire.The man then turns into a racist and under the influence of an older neo-nazi named Cameron, he becomes a neo-nazi gang leader.They shave their heads and wrack havoc on anyone who is not white.He goes to prison for killing three black people who were trying to steal his car.In prison, he works in the laundry room with a black man and starts to change his ways and befriend him.He comes out, completely reformed and no longer racist, however his younger brother is slowly becoming like he used to be, even writing a book report of the Adolf Hitler book ""Mein Kampf"".So now, the man must stop his brother from going down the wrong path he did.American History X is a very good film with very powerful performances.The ending is pretty surprising as well.I recommend it!",American History X
81,Chase_Witherspoon,What goes around comes around,6,31 July 2012,"Evocative and controversial film deals with a neo-Nazi (Norton) whose life spirals out of control when he's incarcerated for his crimes, and discovers that the road to redemption is not going to be without collisions, irrespective of his contrition and new found respect. Furlong, as his kid brother, idolises Norton and follows him into the false promise of hatred, only to find he's been led astray and faces an even more arduous return from the brink, if he gets that opportunity.Some interesting commentary concerning the seemingly innocuous origins of racism, how it incubates through adversity and is then practiced by naivety; a condition to be pitied rather than to fuel reverse hatred. Norton is perhaps too accomplished for the material he's given, because despite the film's sombre tone, it's still clichéd and pretty simplistic in its resolutions. There's plenty of shock value in the beatings and sodomy on offer, but in my opinion, these are milestones in a weak plot that's only vying for conventional pathos. Not strictly the same angle, but I thought ""Romper Stomper"" was a more atmospheric and seemingly realistic portrayal of the neo-Nazi lifestyle in modern society, sans the Hollywood gloss.",American History X
82,brando647,A Powerful Message About Hate,8,16 February 2009,"Here is a film with a powerful message. In his first feature film, Tony Kaye has created a gripping drama that tackles the subject of hate and racism in America. Edward Norton is Derek Vinyard, a charismatic leader in a White Supremecist organization in Venice Beach who is imprisoned for murder. Upon his release, he intends to turn his life around but discovers that his younger brother has fallen in with the same Neo-Nazi organization. A fantastic cast and a strong message come together in this ever-relevant film.Edward Norton deserved more awards for his performance in this movie. For those wondering why I easily consider Norton one of my favorite actors in modern film, Kaye's movie is a prime example. Norton is such a strong performer that one can actually start to understand the racist rhetoric he spouts in the film and for an example of the passion/animosity he summoned for the role, one only needs to see the look on his face when Vinyard is arrested. While Norton is definitely a powerhouse, the film boasts an equally impressive supporting cast including Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacey Keach, and Elliot Gould.The film portrays a powerful message of how hate and violence will only lead to further hate and violence. The main characters are led to discover how meaningless the cause they fight for actually is and the repercussions of their actions. The final few minutes caught me off guard, as I definitely wasn't expecting the ending. While some feel the end to be meaningless, or even counter-productive to the film's theme, I disagree (but I hesitate to go into greater detail at risk of spoilers). Your best bet would be to check out the film and form your own opinion, as the film is sure to inspire thought.On one final note, did anyone else find it odd to see Ethan Suplee in the role of a hate-monger? To his credit though, he did a great job.",American History X
83,elliotjeory,Powerful film,8,24 August 2020,Classic film with Ed Norton in one of his best performances. Great supporting cast too.

84,Lady_Targaryen,See reality in your eyes when hate makes you blind...,9,27 May 2006,"''American History X''is one of the most amazing movies I watched in my life! My dad gave me the tape to watch, and after almost 2 weeks of laziness to watch this movie, I finally watched it 2 times! First, I need to say that both Edwards( Norton and Furlong)are great! Edward Norton specially REALLY looks a skinhead, showing all his anger and awesome body in this movie.I like the end of this movie (who is very sad by the way, since I liked the character Danny very much)showing how hate and violence only makes even more hate and violence, in a effect like a snowball.The other ending that never was filmed, in which Derek shaves his head again in the school bathroom,would not help very much with a good message, but it could have some sense, showing that the prejudice and the racism will continue no matter what we try to solve it. (But it is too pessimistic!)I don't think this movie is racist like many people are saying. It is against racism, since the moral of the story was to show how the prejudice of all races and ethnicities only can make problems and anger for everybody.It's funny to see how many goofs we have in this movie. I didn't pay attention to any of them, since the story itself makes you not bother with errors.",American History X
85,Sergeant_Tibbs,Powerful and raw film despite its flaws.,5,7 January 2009,"This is a film that once had a massive impact on me, a film I used to consider perfect. It achieves many tones with a very well developed protagonist, giving us many situations in when we hate him and what he's done and then sympathize with him. Edward Norton deals with this transition with perfection and makes it 100% believable (even if it takes a rape to do it). The use of flashbacks is effective, and it helps that they are clearly separate (though a cause of the consequence because the actual retelling of the film is set within around 24 hours - this stretch gives us a value of time and helps us re-evaluate the characters). Furlong is equally as powerful giving his only notable performance besides Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Despite the strength of the film within itself in the narrative, the actual message is thin. Not weak, but thin. It seems to blurt out the message at every opportunity, giving almost a before and after of his thoughts in his behaviour. However, the protagonist preaches about racism, it's effected his whole life, but when he encounters a black person face to face on his own his reaction is calmed down and he seems to want to just leave and not take action; which contradicts his feelings. I must admit, there is not a moment in this film that I would give the label ""entertaining"", despite how often engaging it is. Which also makes it boring every time it stops being engaging. The end is the source of the emotional punch which almost alters the films' (or the characters') point and feels rather forced. The fact Tony Kaye actually wanted to disown the film limits my respect for it.7/10",American History X
86,valadas,Too superficial,6,18 May 2006,"Nazism, fascism or neo-Nazism and neo-fascism got multiple causes. Besides the individual personal psychological ones that turn a human being into a Nazi or a Fascist there are the collective social, economic and political ones which give birth to the movements where the individuals integrate themselves. Without the latter causes the former will be socially ineffective. Therefore the racial problem in USA cannot be treated with this simplicity because it's much more complex than what is shown in this movie. This movie is more about personal motives that make one to become a neo-Nazi even if they assume a form of a certain interpretation of social and economic realities usually a wrong one. It doesn't say practically anything about what is most important i. e. the roots of racism as a global social phenomenon. Without it you cannot understand this question. Of course you can tell me now that the movie doesn't intend to be a sociological treatise and just only to tell us a certain story. Well that may be true but then the movie is worth what it's worth regarding the theme of racism that is subjacent to it. This is undoubtedly an honest movie that tells us the credible story of a young neo-Nazi who repents himself of that, after having been in jail convicted for racial homicide and then tries to prevent his younger brother to follow the same path. But the story is told in a too superficial and not very deep way. It doesn't touch the core of the racial question. In respect to that we have only the discussion at the family table in the first part of the movie among the family members including the Jewish boyfriend of the young man's mother, which discussion ends in a bad way. The rest of the movie loses itself, besides the inevitable violent scenes, in some somewhat ingenuous sentimental ones, lacking intensity. In sum this is a sincere and just movie but not particularly remarkable.",American History X

Murray attempts to get Danny expelled for doing this, but Principal Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) — who is black — refuses, instead informing Danny that he will study history and current events under Sweeney, and that the class will be called ""American History X"".

88,sme_no_densetsu,A powerful film about the destructive effects of racism,8,31 March 2009,"""American History X"" focuses on a pair of brothers, both with ties to a neo-nazi skinhead group. Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) returns from an eye-opening prison stint to find that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his footsteps. Derek is committed to saving his family from further heartache but he soon finds that his past cannot easily be left behind.The cast is a pretty good one and features Edward Norton in an Oscar-nominated role. There are some other notable names and familiar faces but for the most part the acting isn't particularly remarkable. Perhaps the best supporting performance comes from Stacy Keach as manipulative white supremacist Cameron Alexander.Back when the film was released, director Tony Kaye tried to have his name taken off of it, supposedly because Edward Norton had recut the film. If that is indeed true I can't say that it hurt the film, though I suppose that we'll never know for sure. Kaye's direction indulges in a few flourishes but typically he keeps things simple. I'm not crazy about the stylistic choice of shooting the flashback scenes in black and white but others may not share my opinion.All things considered, the film is a powerful one, though the story isn't without a few faults. Some of the plot points seem a bit manufactured but the story is compelling and the ending packs an undeniable punch. I recommend the film though I think that it's a tad overrated.",American History X
89,Screen_Blitz,"Powerful, unflinching portrayal of racism",9,5 March 2016,"Racism is major issue that has been going on America for many generations now, and what still goes on in our society today. Many may be familiar with some of the most notorious racist gangs such as the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Brotherhood It has negatively affected the way we function as a society and lead to many tragedies and controversies in many areas of our society. This dark drama directed by Tony Kaye paints a powerful and brutal picture on racism and bigotry, and the consequences they can be lead to. Set in Venice Beach, California, this film stars Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, a once-happy young man with a healthy family who lost his father after he was shot by an African-American for simply doing his job. Angered by the circumstances of his death, Derek turns from an innocent young man into a cold, hate-filled skinhead, and becomes the leader of a white supremacist gang who exercises hatred against every racial group outside the white protestant. After getting arrested for brutally killing a black man who tries to rob his car, Derek spends three years in prison where he unexpectedly develops a bond with black man Lamont (played by Guy Torry) who teaches them that not all black men are evil. Upon leaving the prison, Derek comes home as a changed man, but learns that his younger brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path and tries to help him from suffering the same fate.This movie is made to paint a realistic portrayal of the life of skinheads, and the consequences that ensue. The film succeeds this feat very well and what results is a dark and gritty powerhouse drama that is incredibly difficult to watch. Writer David McKenna gives a powerful, if horrifying treatment to the characters and the story, and when it all comes on-screen, it pulls the audience into a dark atmosphere that rarely lets them rest. During the opening scene, we are introduced to the main character Derek Vinyard, sporting a shaved head and a swastika tattooed on his chest, representing him as a Neo- Nazi, within those minutes; we learn the atrocities of this character and his cruel, racist aspect. Vinyard is played by Edward Norton is astoundingly convicted in the role, he just swallows up the role with his performance and the scenes of his character spitting at others with his cold-hearted bigotry and hatred feel frighteningly real.When tackling the issues of racism, the story does not hold back nor does it try to manipulate audience with emotionality as both the emotional (and physical) intensity come almost naturally through the visceral storytelling. The story is told with a subplot of Derek's younger brother Danny being assigned by his principal Dr. Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) to write about Derek after his teacher (who is Jewish) sends him to the office for submitting an offensive essay on the book 'Mein Kempf'. The story progresses through Danny typing up his paper while jumping back and forth through a series of flashbacks (shown in black and white) showing the brothers' significant moments related to their white supremacy. These scenes include disorienting hate speeches against blacks, Asians, Jews, and pretty much every foreign racial group by Derek, a supermarket raid, a more detail and disturbing depiction of the murder Derek commits, and his experience of redemption he gained while serving time in prison. The story flows on well without just a minor flaw towards the end dealing a revelation of the character's racist behavior that feels a bit too tacked at the last minute. And it builds up to the one of the most shocking and heart-wrenching endings that leaves you speechless.American History X is very brutal portrayal of racism, and one that is very difficult to sit through. But at the same time, it is very important film to watch as it teaches viewers a powerful message about how racism not only hurts others, but can devastate you as a person. Edward Norton's performance is absolutely amazing and the writing is utterly inspiring at its best. This is a film I recommend, but probably not to those under 17 as the material can be very challenging to handle, even for the most harden individuals.",American History X

When he is sent into jail, slowly his beliefs begin to be questioned as he meets the people he used to hate so much and gets to know them better. Back in freedom, his younger brother wants to take the same path of right-wing gang membership and to change his mind won't be easy.In many ways this is a tremendous movie. It shows the power of education, that what we pass on to our children can influence their whole lives and even political beliefs. On the other hand it depicts how getting to know people instead of just talking about them can change your mind on how to interact with them. Futhermore, it is also a portrayal of a dysfunctional family, that struggles with death and disease. Unlike other reviewers, I sometimes would have wished for the moral of the film to be a bit more subtle. It is important to stand up loud against xenophobia, but it makes the film a bit easy to attack. Also, unfortunately, not all right-wing followers are just young and confused kids, we need to take them seriously in order to stop them.All in all this is an outstanding film concerned with a very important issue. Not my personal favorite in terms of the filmmaking side but that's just a question of taste since it is carried out more than professionally.",American History X
91,Pumpkin_Man,"A Great, Powerful and Brutal Film!!!",10,2 October 2015,"I finally watched this recently and was quite surprised by good it was. The movie deals with the touchy subject of racism and ends with redemption and sadness. Edward Norton was intense and brutal as the skinhead Derek Vinyard. His brother, Danny idolizes him and wants to follow in his footsteps by being a white supremacist. There was one scene in particular where Derek tries to make a point by almost attacking his family at the dinner table I thought was very claustrophobic and tense. The majority of the movie takes place in a series of black-and-white flashbacks that shows Derek's reign and killing two black teens for stealing his car. Three years later, Danny is excited for his brother to get out of jail, but finds that he's reformed and ashamed of his past. Derek tries to help Danny change his ways before it's too late. I can't believe it has taken me this long to see this film. The ending is pretty tragic, but I would go so far as to call it a masterpiece.

This is a heavy film with some great suspense moments, however nothing really jumps out at you despite the film being just around two hours long. The whole time I was amazed and transfixed by the acting and writing, but it never really shocked me in the way I expected to be. In my opinion, this is the only factor in keeping it from being a perfect film and one of the best of the 1990s. As mentioned before, Edward Norton proves he is arguably the best actor of this generation with a phenomenal performance that makes him so evil in black and white, as well as being able to sympathize for him in color.

The film cuts back and forth between the past and present, showing us what Derek used to be like and the path that his younger brother is at risk of going down.It's a solid drama and an interesting enough watch, but with an average rating of 8.5 it's also massively overrated. Several parts of the film feel forced and not at all convincing, especially the ending which was over-the-top and completely unnecessary.

Though I was a bit confused with the ending.  I didn't find it necessary.  Sure I know there's a form of racisim in every race, but did we have to end the movie in such a way.  Maybe it's because of all the stupid school shootings in american today.Frankly when I was young, I felt a little racist.  But I fortunately grew out of that.  Hate as they say in the movie is no way to live. Sure I don't want to deny them their free speech, but once it gets violent, then thats entirely different.  It's amazing how many racist webpages are out there.  I remember a few years ago, some of us raided the IRC undernet chatroom #kkk.  Bet ya anything, those strange folk are still there.

98,marcslope,God bless Edward Norton...,5,28 July 2003,"...and God grant him a less grandstanding, more subtle director than Tony Kaye, who has piled cliché on top of cliché in this diatribe against neo-Nazism and poured on the anti-racist moralizing as if he had invented the concept. You want faux-home movies of kids at the shore to symbolize lost innocence? You got it. Slow-motion violence? Check. Black-and-white flashbacks to contrast against the blood-spattered color of the present-day sequences? Why not. Pseudo-religious, semi-liturgical musical scoring to mythologize and elegize the predictable dramatics? It's dripping with it. The kind of rote plotting that demands one character will have to be sacrificed for the sins of another? That's here, too. The storytelling is resolutely episodic, a series of (predictable) set pieces: the basketball court confrontation, the convenience-store riot (which is admittedly frightening stuff), the prison gang-rape, the neo-Nazi rally. It's all prosaically told, but Norton does create a complex portrait out of little, carefully conveying Derek's anger, conflicting familial feelings, fierce protectiveness, and growing consciousness. Some very good veteran actors help out -- Beverly D'Angelo, Elliott Gould, Stacy Keach -- and Avery Brooks somehow manages to turn his angelic-teacher turn into more than a device. God knows a subject this timely and vital deserves more nuance and analysis, but the brute force of Norton's acting and the excellent support from little-brother Furlong (though Kaye, predictably again, lingers too long and in too-relentless closeup on all that anguished doe-eyed adolescence) ultimately win out over ham-fisted direction and unimaginative screen writing.",American History X
99,hall895,"No, we can't all get along",7,31 December 2012,"American History X tells the story of Derek Vinyard, a vile, racist, murderous neo-Nazi skinhead who decides he doesn't want to be that guy anymore. But he will find that once you are living that life it is not at all easy to get out. And much to Derek's chagrin he sees his brother Danny going down the same path which nearly destroyed him. Derek knows he has to reach Danny, change him, open his eyes. Before it's too late.The film's story unfolds in an unconventional manner. We see the present-day Derek, a man determined to do good, to change himself and save his brother. This is intercut with flashbacks which show us the monster Derek was. When the film opens Derek is about to be released from prison. When we go back in time to see how he ended up in jail it is shocking and disturbing to say the least. We see a man consumed by hatred and anger. He tears his family apart. He destroys his own life. And he does it all with a sinister smirk on his face. The saddest thing is that Danny idolizes his older brother. Danny is a skinhead too, proud of it. There was a time Derek would have been proud of what Danny had become. That time has gone. Prison changed Derek. How exactly it changed him is told in quite vivid, brutal detail. And when it becomes clear who it was who eventually reached Derek, changed his way of thinking, it all begins to make sense. The path to Danny's salvation appears. There is only one person who was ever really going to be able to change Danny and that was his brother. But Derek had someone very important on his side to help things along. That help had better come quickly. Danny may be too far gone, time is running out.It's a captivating film with an undeniably powerful story. But it's not a film without flaws. While Edward Norton is magnificent as Derek there's the sense Edward Furlong, playing Danny, struggles to keep pace. When Norton and Furlong share the screen, and they share the film's most important moments, there's the sense that Furlong just doesn't measure up. There's a certain level of maturity required to handle the very challenging role and Furlong seems to lack it. There are times it's hard to take his character seriously and that's a problem in a film as deadly serious as this one. The film also has a bit of a disjointed feel to it. The nonlinear structure works but not all of the pieces really end up fitting properly. This probably has something to do with the fact the film was taken out of director Tony Kaye's hands and reassembled by others, most notably Norton. There are places where the narrative just doesn't flow freely, the film bogs down. Kaye has said he wanted to make a tighter, shorter film. It probably would have been better if he had gotten that opportunity. The film also does a rather poor job of establishing the roots of Derek's hatred. One flashback dinner conversation with his father is all we really get and that sequence doesn't really work. It's as if it had to be tossed in because there had to be something there at the root of all this. But it's not enough. And then Derek's prison transformation, again not entirely convincing. You don't let go of that much hatred that quickly.In one of his earlier racial diatribes Derek had invoked Rodney King, the man who famously asked, ""Can we all get along?"" The old Derek thought Rodney King was some kind of subhuman, the scum of the earth. The new Derek wants us all to get along. But we can't. Some of us have gone too far down the path of hatred and bigotry. You may want to change yourself. But it's hard to change the world. Derek wants to leave his old life behind. More importantly, he wants his brother to leave that world of hate behind. The clock ticks. Time is not on Derek's side.",American History X
100,ODDBear,Absolutely riveting,10,10 February 2009,"This is one powerful movie. Not only is this movie an excellent showcase of dangerous thinking but also the misguided ways and wisdom that led to it.Edward Norton's performance is nothing short of spectacular, playing basically two versions of the same man. Utterly convincing and extremely menacing as the hateful C.O.D. leader, recruiting armies of impressionable people in the fight against society's parasites. Completely convinced in his cause, there's no better soldier for White Power. Norton's equally convincing as the broken down, fully repentant ""born again"" man released from prison, after committing a brutal act of violence.There's no sugar coating here; Norton is as brutal as they come. An intellectual filled with hatred finds just the right place to vent it and his mentor (a slimy and effective Stacey Keach) pushes all the right buttons.No less effective is Edward Furlong, as Norton's impressionable younger brother. Idolizing his brother, Furlong attempts to impress his brother by following in his footsteps, though it's somewhat apparent that he's not at all like his brother in way of thinking. He can be force fed, but ultimately with right guidance he could be steered in the right direction.Also interesting here is the film's statement about where the evil seed is sown. At a casual conversation at dinner time, the hard working father of Norton explains (somewhat clumsily) to him to question things and not take things simply at face value. Displaying some irritation over affirmative action the father exposes some racial concerns that may be attributed to racism. But the overall impression of the man is that he's decent, with some strong viewpoints which all may not agree with, but the scene clearly implies that racism can be passed on. Once his father dies in a shooting, the troubled son focuses his rage in all the wrong places and a figure like Keach provides him a dangerous feeding ground to nurture his rage.But this rage only taints his soul and causes sorrow and heartbreak for all around him and in the end proves quite costly.American History X is a sobering look at a massive world wide problem and it makes a strong case for what kind of people get involved with a cause like White Supremacy. Troubled or alienated kids, looking for a place in a detached cold world could easily find solidarity in a group like this. The same can apply for almost any group, be it a community of gay people, religious groups or activists against seal killing, whatever, people look to belong to some kind of community. The trouble here is that these people breed a dangerous, dividing way of thinking and, at worst, killers for a very misguided cause.American History X is one of those must-see movies. I cannot recommend it enough. Rambling over.",American History X
101,Stampsfightclub,exceptional drama about racism,9,21 December 2006,"The narrative.A passionate emotive tale about racism in society where Norton (Fight Club) is juxtaposed with Furlong (Terminator 2) as brothers who contend with many racial issues in Southern America. The beginning is sensational. The camera comprises a slow moving long shot of a seaside, filmed in black and white to emphasise America's gentleness and emotion. The film continues its brilliance with a disturbing black and white flashback of why Norton ended up in prison and set the agenda to state the purpose of the film, that violence and racism is wrong in every society. The film preaches society values through the characters, especially Norton who is completely against the black stereotypes and wishes to take action to defend himself and his country. His speeches and actions through the film are remarkable and his character is very controversial, to pull this role was sensational and he thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination for playing a character that is evil, violent and dominant but then sentimental and vulnerable over certain issues. The film is always engaging and extremely powerful. It entices older audiences with powerful moving speeches and violent actions by opinionated characters. Norton and Furlong were both outstanding and deserve praise for playing such emotional characters in this extremely violent film. The ending was remarkable, a shocking tactic by director Kaye who directed this film superbly throughout, but the ending is so powerful I was in tears. It was sensational the way it ended and will leave audiences asking many questions and wondering about their own actions and consequences. Flashbacks were a fantastic technique to emphasise the use of the character's lives and the significance of Norton's change. Always filmed in black and white the flashbacks set emotion and convince audiences of the brutality of the Vinyard lives. Racism in society. I'm not accustomed to racism and don't know enough about issues regarding Nazis but I can tell by watching this film that there was and still is something wrong in society. People are entitled to their own opinions about immigrants and other country values but to me it is wrong, there should be equality in the world and this film emphasises how wrong society actually is by encoding hate crimes and a powerful differentiation between different cultural groups. It is so powerful and meaningful that it simply can't be ignored. It will take a strong person to cope but it is an essential watch for the powerful racial, parenting, family, school and crime ideologies put forth.",American History X
102,CharltonBoy,A Black picture of American History,8,1 March 2000,The first thing to say about about American History x is that it is a two hour film that could and should have been an hour longer and that is about the only negative thing i can think of to say about this superb movie. American history x is a brilliantly acted masterpiece of a film about a white supremisist nazi who goes to prison for the shooting of two black thieves and the story of how he comes around to believing that the whole racist scene is fundimentaly wrong and his struggle to make his brother believe the same. Great acting from all the cast but a special mention must go to Edward Norton for the lead role. 8 out of 10.,American History X

Most of the film is flashback (in black and white) illustrating the progression of a relatively normal working class kid from average joe to a virulent hate-filled racist, and how 3 years at Chino causes a spiritual awakening and repudiation of his past.American History X is kept from being a great movie by its preachiness, and a failure to resolve and/or explain some of its  sub-plots and currents.American History X is a powerful film with large doses of physical and emotional violence, and it definately deserves its R rating.

104,fwomp,Sitting In Awe Of Norton's Performance And The Film's Message...,10,3 May 2009,"American HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, THE PAINTED VEIL), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.But can he...Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother? Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what 'might' happen.I hope...An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost.",American History X
105,KnightsofNi11,Slow beginnings pay off in the end,8,25 January 2012,"It's hard to know what to expect going into American History X. It's not the most approachable or accessible film, and it deals with particularly dark subject matter that is disturbing and off putting to many viewers. Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard, the head of a Neo-Nazi gang. In the film, Derek has just been let out of prison after serving a three year term for murder. When he gets released he comes to realize the error of his ways in the past, and now he is determined to prevent his little brother Danny from making the same mistakes he did. The whole film takes place on the day Derek gets out of jail, but black and white flashbacks dominate about 60-70 percent of the film. Watching his film is a brutal endeavor and I had some issues with it at first, but it all pays off in the end.American History X has a very strange and offbeat style to it. The cinematography is uniquely nuanced between black and white and color. The film utilizes a lot of camera techniques in strange places, such as the abundance of odd close ups and tilted camera angles. These things are somewhat distracting at times, but they give the whole film an uncomfortable and chaotic atmosphere that really sucks you in. Overall it is indeed an engaging film, possibly because of its oddities.It's also unique in its verbose screenplay. The film is full of ranting monologues that push the sub textual point of the film a little too heavy and make the film a little simplistic at times. However, it is filled with very poignant dialogue that captivates and compels to a great extent. The racist and hate filled rants that Derek delves into multiple times throughout the movie are extremely shocking as well as fascinating, albeit ridiculous at times. One issue I encountered, however, was the way the script isn't exactly able to differentiate its levels of speech. All the characters talk with the same literacy and dialect, and all with a very similar cadence to their delivery. This fault doesn't make it seem like Derek is the highly intelligent, yet misguided, young man we are led to believe he is. Instead he seems to be at the same level of intelligence as the rest, just with an ounce more charisma. Yet at the core of all its vulgarity and flaws the script is really very intelligent and has a lot to offer in the big picture.The big picture is an important term to use here because you have to finish all of American History X to get the whole picture. The film makes you think up to the very last shot. When I really thought the film would end up being a disappointment it hit me with a powerful and shocking ending that changed all of what I thought about this film. The film might slip up during the first two acts, but when it all starts to come together towards the end the payoff is unexpectedly brilliant. American History X is well worth the watch. It's not your average run of the mill film and it will challenge your mind to think bigger and it will open your eyes to the bigger and darker world we live in.",American History X
106,khanbaliq2,Edward Norton is absolutely riveting as the menacing skinhead at the center of American History X.,7,7 December 2009,"American History X is an inflated yet gut-slugging film. The story is about a neo-Nazi skinhead (Edward Norton) who sees the error of his ways in prison, and tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) following in his footsteps.American History X is jolting melodrama about an intelligent racist, which engineers his redemption too cheaply and gets suckered by its own lyric power. The film often seems at war with itself, but that's precisely the quality that makes Norton's performance so riveting. Director Tony Kaye disowned the released version, and claimed that Norton had altered and edited the film to give his role more prominence. Still, it's a compelling and provocative story.",American History X
107,The_Movie_Cat,Likeably absurd...,6,13 November 2019,"Likeable albeit thoroughly preposterous nonsense that somehow sits in the IMDb top 40 ahead of titles like Modern Times, Bicycle Thieves and Rashomon.Edward Norton plays a white supremacist who learns love and acceptance of black people after going to jail and befriending a black guy who tells him jokes. He then realises that white supremacists aren't all they're cracked up to be after they rape him in the prison showers... something he later claims he's ""glad"" happened.The film eventually enters an ever higher point of absurdism, as overblown, showstopping music - the kind only an American studio would think was appropriate - fills the screen. Scenes like two brothers tearing down their bedroom decorations of Nazi memorabilia are pat and simplistic, and too ""easy"". The plot lines take over the movie, and characters change from scene to scene because they're required to, not because of realistic motives. Even a typically eccentric performance by Avery Brooks can't rescue the film from its ludicrous premise.At date of writing, American History X is rated on the IMDb as the 35th greatest movie of all time, comfortably ahead of Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now. It's watchable stuff, possibly for all the wrong reasons, but probably shouldn't even be in the top 350, let alone top 35.",American History X
108,Falconeer,"2nd rate melodrama, unbelievably overrated..",4,1 March 2007,"According to the IMDb list of the top 250 films of all time, THIS comes in at a staggering #44. If we are to go by this incoherent list, we are to believe that ""American History X"" is a better film than Kubrik's ""Clockwork Orange."" It is superior to the ""Deer Hunter,"" and the classic ""Third Man."" It even outshines Germany's epic masterpiece ""Der Untergang/Downfall."" After you are finished laughing, consider the film ""American History X,"" a hack job so embarrassing that it's director, Tony Kaye wisely attempted to have his name removed from the final product. Why would a director want to deny responsibility for a film that is considered by countless idiots who consider this better than ""Metropolis??"" Because 'A.H.X' is a mediocre film at best. From it's infantile, laughable, simplistic, and thoroughly inaccurate views on racism, to it's soap opera like melodrama, down to it's gross, comical overblown stereotypes, such as the ex-gang member 'uncle tom' preachings of Avery Brooks, as the black school principal, to the ultra stereotyped Jewish ideal, played by none other than Elliott Gould! Why weren't more people offended by this obnoxious representation of minorities? And of course, the skinheads were portrayed as ugly, stupid, and faceless monsters, with the exception of Hollywood movie star Ed Norton, who is a fine actor, but who was just too pretty to be believable here. A word of advice to future filmmakers: If you want to make a powerful statement about serious political issues, avoid using the latest Hollywood pin-up hunk to get the point across, as it just does not work. Remember Alan Pakula's ""Devil's Own"" with Brad Pitt as the hunky IRA hero/terrorist? Enough said. Ed Norton plays Derek, a young man who turns into a hate preaching neo nazi skinhead after his fireman dad is shot while putting out a fire in the ghetto project. Norton does not look like he ever stepped foot inside a housing project, but that does not stop him from becoming the spokesperson/leader to a generation of mean, angry skinheads, all of which tower above Norton. And as good an actor as Norton is, I did not believe him in the role of a lower middle class skinhead; He sounded more like a sheltered private school boy trying to act tough. It seems that the filmmakers have never even met a real skinhead, as this portrayal was so unbelievably inaccurate. AHX makes the mistake that so many Hollywood films make; It attempts to manipulate our emotions with sad, wistful, dramatic music. This method was grossly overused here, and some of the dialog could barely be made out over the overpowering ""backround"" music. More evidence of this films failings; if the script, and performances are good, we will feel the emotions on our own. Intelligent moviegoers do not need our emotions to be ""cued"" by the appropriate music. This is a sure sign of a poor film. Derek's transformation from normal boy, to racist skinhead, to finally a strong, enlightened protector of his family and responsible brother/son, after an ""Oz"" like stint in jail, would work fine, for a film made for television. But the fact that this thoroughly underwhelming movie scored so high on this website is proof enough that these ratings cannot be taken seriously. It saddens me that so many people cannot see the difference between truly good cinema, and mediocrity. It is more tragic that so many people can be this easily manipulated by this kind of Hollywood dreck. Having had the opportunity to view hundreds of films from around the world, I am not impressed by Hollywood's repeated attempts at making serious, intelligent films that deal with issues such as racism and poverty. Hollywood needs to stick with the flashy entertainment, the explosions, the comedies, the Sci-fi, as for this type of film-making, Hollywood can't be beat. And for those who want to see a truly good film dealing with the same subject matter as A.H.X, take a look at ""Mississippi Burning"". Here is a rare example of when Hollywood got it right; a well made, beautifully realized piece of cinema, that deals with the racism issue without being corny or ridiculous. As far as ""American History X"" goes, do not believe the hype.",American History X

111,ajs-10,An enthralling tale of redemption...,9,12 June 2011,"I have to admit that I have seen this film before, but I maybe didn't appreciate it as much before as I did this time around. Everything about it is great, the plot, the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography and the music are all excellent. It maybe wouldn't have been top of my list of films to see due to the subject matter, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Yes, it does tend to wander a little in the middle and the pacing isn't at top whack, but it is quite compelling viewing all the same.Derek Vinyard was a neo-Nazi when he went into prison for the murder of two thieves at his house. He was the top dog amongst the guys he ran with, all with shaven heads and believing every word of their leader. Words fed to him by the manipulative Cameron Alexander. But something changed in Derek while he was inside, he came out wanting nothing to do with these people any more. He is in fear that his little brother, Danny will follow him down the same route. We are told, in flashback, how Derek became involved with these people in the first place and what went on in prison to change his view. The trouble is, is it too late for young Danny? As you've probably already guessed, the Spoiler Police won't allow me to say any more.I have to say hats off to both Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny. I have not seen either of them put in a better performance either before or since. Also worthy of note are; Beverly D'Angelo as their mother, Doris, Avery Brooks as the head teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, Jennifer Lien as their sister, Davina, Stacy Keach as the evil Cameron Alexander and it was also nice to see Elliott Gould as Murray, the English teacher.A large portion of the film is told in flashback and all of the flashback portions are in black and white, making it very easy for the audience to discern where the story is. I found this enhanced rather than distracted me from the narrative. There is much to admire in this film and I enjoyed it immensely. So, over all a really well made film with some great performances, a great score, a great script and some great cinematography Recommended.My Score: 8.7/10",American History X
112,TheNorthernMonkee,powerful film with an important message,9,21 April 2005,"SPOILERS April 2005 and Britain is held in the grips of a general election. Voting to decide who will become the next Prime Minister of the country, one of the key topics seems to be immigration. Pioneered by a Conservative leader who is seemingly obsessed, the issue has brought up the old trend of racial tension. What happens though when you stop perceiving an awkward subject as a problem, and begin to passionately hate all those who are different from you. In ""American History X"", Ed Norton provides perhaps his finest ever performance as a reformed Neo-Nazi with a mission. Powerful from start to finish, the film is not afraid to show the views of the extremist, whilst simultaneously proving the flaws in their arguments.Derek Vinyard (Norton) is the figurehead leader of a bunch of Neo-Nazi's in Venice Beach. Full of anger and hatred, Derek devotes his life to winning the area back for the whites. After a spell in prison however, Derek reappears dramatically different. Keen to get out of the way of life, he finds that his former associates are not that easy to escape from as he attempts to stop his younger brother Danny (Ed Furlong) from going down the same route.Written by David McKenna, ""American History X"" is a film that everybody should see. Whilst not the finest for direction and far from the finest film ever, it is a crucial film due it's solid performances, and the message it provides.As the bitter and twisted Derek, Ed Norton is indescribable. Playing an incredibly clever character, Norton manages to play the character as someone who has an underlying hatred beneath the surface, and who believes a view which he can't even convincingly argue for in a debate. Norton can give the character a sense of menace, whilst simultaneously giving a sense of internal misery and weakness. Some might suggest that the simple reason for this menace is that it tends to only be present when he has a shaved head, but this isn't true. This, almost terrifying, display which the character portrays is based on Norton's ability to walk the walk as it were and show an arrogance of sorts. Anyone can shave their head and attempt to look tough, but Norton succeeds, not through the lack of hair, but through his actions.One example of a character who can shave their head but never actually look even remotely intimidating is Edward Furlong's Danny. Played to perfection by Furlong, this character never really looks anything but a young, naive, scared boy with an admiration for his brother. Throughout the film, we see someone on the verge of fully committing to an ideal, but who never actually seems to commit. To Danny it always feels more like he is trying to imitate his brother whilst trying to belong to a group. Again, this is down not to a script, but purely down to an outstanding turn by Furlong.Perhaps the greatest thing about ""American History X"" is the way that we are shown the errors of Derek's ways. In so many ways, this film could have evolved into an arrogant story which preaches at you like a religious leader. It avoids this though. What ""American History X"" does is that for segments it shows family debates where views are discussed across a dinner table. We hear points of view about the extremity of equality in the work place, and we listen to ideas which have SOME logic and reasoning behind them. Through discussion and alternative events however, the film shows that the majority of these views are lacking. We are shown that there are extremists from both sides who argue both for liberalism and for fascism, but that ultimately all of these views are irrelevant. So much could be said about the eventual conclusions of ""American History X"" that hours could be spent on one part of the overall view. Ultimately though, the film demonstrates that actions speak louder than words and we should remember that.""American History X"" is not the best made film ever, but it is one of the most important. In a world today where race and issues surrounding the topic is so dominant, we need films like this. Superbly acted, and brilliantly thought out, it is a film to be watched and absorbed.",American History X
113,Libretio,Evils of racism exposed by scorching drama,6,12 February 2005,"""American History X""Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)An angry young white supremacist (Edward Norton) is reformed whilst in prison for killing two black men, and struggles to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from travelling down the same desperate path.Scorching drama, elevated by Norton's intense performance as the frustrated rebel whose intelligence is twisted by circumstances into an all-consuming hatred of minorities, until his eyes are finally opened to the realities of such manufactured racism. Commercials/music video director Tony Kaye made his feature debut here, though the project was taken out of his hands by studio bosses and 'completed' by Norton following a lengthy editing process, prompting Kaye to reject the finished product (he was refused permission to credit himself as 'Humpty Dumpty'). David McKenna's script describes the ways in which Nazi ideology is propagated by strong-minded individuals who impose their influence on the young and vulnerable (Stacy Keach plays the head of Norton's local skinhead chapter, who co-ordinates episodes of violent 'activism' from a safe legal distance), and how it manifests itself amongst those without an appropriate outlet for their aggressive tendencies.The film kicks into high gear from the outset, when the full extent of Norton's racism becomes apparent during a horrific confrontation with his widowed mom's new boyfriend (Elliott Gould), followed by a gut-wrenching scene in which Norton commits the sickening crime that will send him to prison and change his life forever. There, his worldview is profoundly challenged not only by his friendship with African-American co-worker Guy Torry (terrific in a pivotal role), but also by the double standards employed amongst the skinhead gangs he encounters within the prison system. For these characters, there can be no happy ending, and the film builds to a shattering finale. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, William Russ and an unrecognizable Fairuza Balk.

In my opinion one of the best movies ever made with stunning performances from the whole cast exspecially Edward Norton. Edward Norton is just one of those amazing actors of our time who can play any role and play it perfectly.American history X is about a skinhead (Norton) who is basically the leader of the skinhead group. Until one day he goes to jail for a serious crime. He comes out reformed just to find out his younger brother (Furlong) has been brainwashed by the same people who brainwashed him. This movie revolves around the older brother (Norton)trying to help his brother find out that this is not the right way to be.This is an amazing movie filled with heart racing sequences and excellent performances by all the actors involves. The script is just outstanding and the direction is even better. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of dramas or Edward Norton. Very two big thumbs up,American History X

He is put in jail and there learned that he was completely wrong. The film has a lot of charge until its end, but I may ask, why such an end? There is no need for a happy end, but perhaps for something more coherent with the ideas the director seems to defend. Sorry, but the epilogue to me is bias.",American History X
119,AhmedSpielberg99,Brutal History X!,8,24 August 2018,"American History X has one of the most compelling stories I've seen in movies in a while. It's a gut-wrenching, and heartbreaking story. But Tony Kaye's powerful and challenging direction is what made the movie so provocative.The movie also proves that Edward Norton has a huge talent that, unfortunately, has been wasted. Norton delivered the performance of his career in this movie. A performance that elevated the entire movie. While Derek Vinyard, Norton's character, has the most powerful lines in the movie, they wouldn't have been as powerful as they are without Edward Norton's staggering delivering.Also, Edward Norton's performance may be the only thing that remained sharp and solid throughout the whole movie. Because aside from Norton's riveting and smart monologues, the dialogue in this movie, especially at the first two acts, is so weak and often cheesy! The things got better at the last act but at that time I was wondering why the dialogue wasn't that good most of the movie. It's really baffling because the movie needed badly to have a decent and strong dialogue from its beginning, considering its subject matter. The dialogue often was too on the nose and preachy while it should have served its already gripping story. That also made some scenes in the movie feel so awkward and heavy-handed.The dialogue isn't the only, or the biggest issue I've with American History X. As I think that everything related to the Neo Nazi gang is completely underdeveloped. All the characters of the members of this gang are one-dimensional characters. They are totally undeveloped and bland, and almost have no depth. Which is a shame because they play a pivotal part in the story. They are part of the main plot, so to speak.Besides that balancing between two contradictory aspects of the story, Tony Kaye with his mixture of black & white history contrasting with colorful reality is magic to absorb and shows this film up to be what it is. Smoothly moving camera in the scenes in Black and White that are set in the past to convey an unsettling feeling, and bleak and restrained colored scenes to match the dystopian-like present.American History X also has one of the most shocking endings ever. But its ambiguity is what makes it more dreadful. It's an ending that can make you question the protagonist's fate, and that's more than horrifying!(8/10)",American History X
120,emm,Painstakingly important film provides a shattering look at violence and hatred.,7,21 April 1999,"It was very easy to realize in the beginning that I, too, would've found AMERICAN HISTORY X a minor coincidence in the making. Well, I was wrong. Again! Even with the influential direction of Tony Kaye and solid acting of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, the movie still could have squeezed more juice. It could have been simply more or less. More on its details and less of the slow pace, to be exact. You won't keep anybody down for not liking this picture because of its explicit nature. This one took the more provocative route, and it suddenly runs as smooth as premium unleaded gasoline. The disturbing racial hatred that has changed America's societal infrastructure forever is how this picture is portrayed. With its correct state of mind, the movie is nonetheless disturbing as well as horrifyingly true, and shows itself on a very high pinpoint of accuracy. It walks a large step further in giving out a dramatic study of what can actually be a truthful account of the life of a racial hate crime syndicate, and how the lives of two adjusting individuals are shared. The violence is what makes this movie fully express the way society is being mistreated. Certainly speaking, it does go off the deep end and is not for the faint of heart, so that's all there is to know. One nice touch is the use of photography and its expression of colors, which is a good move for having the story tell itself with proper understanding. I really wanted more out of AMERICAN HISTORY X, but it's got rock-solid potential to keep its open-mindedness with a variety of moments.",American History X
121,djurrepower,sub par,5,23 December 2019,"The flashback scenes are what keep this movie good. apart from the journey the older brother makes, its not much to look at. the story felt very short lived and rushed. the performances were fine i guess, but the camera work and editing we not. some jarred cuts and simple shots felt out of place and dont appeal to keep you interested.5/10: not much to care about",American History X
122,skepticskeptical,Didactic and Unrealistic,5,24 August 2020,"The ""message"" of American History X rings out loud and clear: Violence Breeds Violence. Okay, agreed. The primary problem with the production is that it is so filled with literal on-the-nose dialogue that it lacks any subtlety whatsoever.The transformations of the characters is also ridiculously implausible. Derek is some sort of easily manipulable chameleon, for all it takes is a conversation (with his father) for him to become a skinhead, and another conversation (with a prison inmate) for him to go back to his former view. In thinking about the improbable prison conversion, it is important to bear in mind that Derek's father has been killed by a black gang member. Is it at all realistic to believe that he will go through a full-on conversion process to renounce his skinhead affiliation by a black guy he folds sheets with at the prison? Or would he not, in reality, have fallen back in line with his fellow skinheads after their ""encounter"" in the shower, which his white bros appear to have viewed as akin to a hazing process?The storyline as presented would require a monumental power of forgiveness which stretches credulity, to put it mildly. A person angry enough to do what Derek did will likely be forged for life in that mold, if only to be able to live with himself after the horror which he has perpetrated. The younger brother is also a very bizarre asexual transperson, who would be writing it/they/them on its social media profiles if the movie were made today. Dan looks and acts like Jeanne d'Arc (see the early film), unbelievably enough.I believe that the high ratings of this film may be the result of people confusing the message with the delivery. The message rings true. The delivery is heavyhanded and much closer to that of a Lifetime tv feature. In fact, I was wondering throughout whether American History X had been a made-for-television movie. The cinematic style was interesting, with lots of close-up shots of the protagonists preaching. But that is the primary problem: they are preaching (in this case, to the already converted). The use of music is completely melodramatic, but that flaw is minor compared to the absurd story.If you would like to watch an excellent film about racism, see La Haine.",American History X
123,gigan-92,A Film With Obvious Meaning,10,29 September 2010,"Without a doubt Edward Norton's best role, never to be surpassed. The same nearly goes for Edward Furlong, but I'm still contemplating on that one. Nonetheless, both will never be forgotten as roles of nightmarish realism. A reality that some believe to have died off with the rallies and marches in the 60s. But it is alive and well, even in the hearts of some of today's unfortunately misguided youth. The story, as it progresses, expresses one fundamental idea. Ones does not simply wake up and accept the fact that there a fired up racist. It is a seed that starts out small, and is nurtured by those who do not know how to lead, or have their lost their own way. And then, at a certain point, it is fed like a fire needing fuel. But just like a flame, it can always be extinguished. Lots of symbolic stuff, huh? Well, one picks up these things after watching the film several times. Racism is not an inherited fundamental theory. It is a learned trait. The film's director Tony Kane and writer David McKenna worked hard to deliver this theme. As far as I've read at first there was a much more edited and toned down version to be originally released. But thank God that didn't happen. I also give praise to Anne Dudley's score, pure emotion if you ask me. An A+ plus no less.",American History X
124,redkiwi,Truly superb,9,28 May 2000,"This is a brilliant film, but very disturbing.  Norton as the skinhead who sees the error of his ways is excellent in the role, notably his internal strife and his trying to guide his brother away from following him.The rest of the cast support him well in what is a truly frightening insight into a section of society that people don't talk about, but is there and needs addressing.",American History X
125,moviesleuth2,Wow,10,12 July 2008,"When the credits started rolling after the film ""American History X,"" the one word, the one feeling that I felt was: Wow. This is an amazing, powerful film.One could quickly classify this as a film that deals with racism, but that is a misconception. ""American History X"" is about hate, and one man's journey from having it rule his life to realizing how pointless it is.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was the poster-boy for a white supremacist gang in California. Things changed after he was sent to prison for murder, and now he's trying to prevent his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path.""American History X"" is like the ultimate persuasive speech, both in what it achieves and how it's constructed. This powerful film tackles a complex and relevant subject head-on. But its construction as a piece of skilled rhetoric is genius. There's the set-up, addressing of both sides of the issue, then finally the explanation of the point that it wants to make. Director Tony Kaye deftly handles the material so that the subject matter, rather than directorial flair, is what hammers in the point. And he uses enough subtlety to make ""American History X"" seem more like a film than a piece of rhetoric.What makes this film work so well is that it seeks to UNDERSTAND both sides of the issue. It doesn't humanize people who hate, and it certainly doesn't expect the audience to sympathize with them, but it explains why they hate. This makes for a more compelling argument because it allows for a more finely-tuned rebuttal. The fact that the skinheads, at least Derek Vinyard, are allowed to sound intelligent, gives a fresh look on an argument that if done any other way would give this film a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel.Additionally, it gives insight into the sources of hate and how people like the skinheads become the frontrunners of such feelings. It offers a number of origins and introduces them in a number of ways.This film wouldn't be as compelling and powerful had it not been for a cast filled with superior performances. Edward Norton received an Oscar nod for this role, and he earned it. This is easily his best performance. His character has a wide, dramatic arc and Norton never loses sight of the character. Edward Furlong is impressive as Danny. Furlong has been almost off the map since his star-making debut opposite Arnold Schwartzenegger and Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Here he makes it clear that he hasn't grown out of his acting ability. Beverly D'Angelo shows that she can act off of someone other than Chevy Chase (and in a hard-hitting drama, no less). Stacy Keach is suitably creepy and vile as Cameron, the man who helped Derek with his rise to ""god"" status amongst the skinheads, but Keach wisely never goes over the top. Elliot Gould, Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee (in an unexpectedly fine performance) are all in good form here.The one person who gets no praise but deserves much is Avery Brooks. He's brilliant and at times equal to Norton. He fills the mentor role, but he knows this is not supposed to be a gentle performance a la Robin Williams in ""Dead Poet's Society"" (no ill-will towards Williams' role in that film); he's gritty and forceful and he fits right in. It's a shame that he didn't get an Oscar nod for his performance.According to IMDb, director Tony Kaye claimed that Edward Norton altered the film so much to give himself an Oscar nod for his performance that Kaye wanted his name to be replaced by ""Humpty Dumpty."" He filed a $275 million lawsuit against the Director's Guild and New Line Cinema when he wasn't allowed to remove his name. Be that as it may, at least the result was not the disaster that usually happens to a film that suffers from too much interference from someone OTHER than the director. It's hard to imagine this film being any better. Still, it would be interesting to see the director's cut of the film (the deleted scenes aren't much help in guessing what Kaye's original vision was, as they're mostly the sort of throwaway scenes that had a reason for being left on the cutting room floor).While I respect Kaye's decision for wanting his name removed, having been left with his name on the film is not exactly a bad thing. In fact, his work is amazing. The scenes from Derek's past are shown in black and white (no hint of film noir-style from the oldie films), and the scenes from the present are shown in color. Kaye acted as his own cinematographer, and his skill in both positions is evident.Insightful, provocative, and undeniably powerful, ""American History X"" is a brilliant film, and one that needs to be seen.",American History X
126,athies,Excellent Movie,10,5 August 2002,"Why do people only believe traumatic events push you towards the dark side in movies, but when a movie portrays a traumatic event pushing the character in a good way they refuse to believe it. Edward Norton's character has plenty of time to think in prison, and this takes three years - that is not quick at all. Prison gives you nothing but time to think. Of course we are not going to see every nuance of his change of mind over those three years, just the key moments. If you want to talk about a movie where a character makes a total chance towards race in a very short amount of time see Monster's Ball. Other review say Edward Norton's character transforms to a lover of all races. I do not see this at all. He becomes tolerant, at least to the point of being quiet. I believe silent hatred is the first step towards racial unity. This is flat out an excellent movie.",American History X
127,nathanmanson,That's an all time classic,9,5 January 2021,That was an absolute masterpiece. Edward Norton is an hell of an actor but it appears he's not the best at crying because when he was crying over his brothers dead body it wasn't very realistic.

128,rajdoctor,American History X,7,19 August 2007,"Number 41 in IMDb list.The movie deals with racism and hate. A neo-nazi Black hating fanatic person Derek (Edward Norton) shoots out 2 black men who come to rob at his house. He gets 3 years in jail. When he comes out he finds his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) walk on the same path as he had walked. Derek attempts to persuade Danny not to be like him but follow the path of life that is without hate. In between the movie deals with flashback on the transformation of Derek in the prison.The movie attempt is strong. The Director Tony Kate must have taken lots of guts to make this movie on racism and hate. It is not amazing to know that in its titles he did not want his name to be mentioned  (instead he preferred Hummpy Dummpy) just of the fear of being targeted by both black and white groups.The movie is bold, touches the most relevant subject of hatred between different people. But half way through the movie I felt that it has become too preachy. I also had this notion that Jews must have produced it. I do not know whether it is true  but there was one silly dialogue in the movie that will remain in my memory  You look good, you look like a Jew. That itself was racist and discriminating and negative conditioning.That apart, Edward Norton played the role really well. He was fortunate to get good roles in his career  Fight Club and then this. Now a day he has lost his ability, rawness and spontaneity.This movie can also become so relevant in today's India where the fanatic Brahmins wants to teach hatred to their children for lower castes, untouchables, minorities etc.Technically the movie is brilliant. It uses good black and white flashbacks and color current events. The camera work, the prison shots etc. are very authentic. The beginning sex scene was a bit overdone and totally unnecessary in the event of things in this movie.Sadly the movie starts with black committing a crime and getting killed by a racist white, and ends with racist black killing a white person.Anyways, a good representation and attempt!

Meanwhile, his younger brother, Danny is following the same road his older brother had been busted for and as Derek is released from prison, he tries to reshape his life back and reshape his brother's as well. American History X is an excellent film on all levels. Continuously, the movie is grabbing a hold of you and not letting you go for so many reasons. The performances were all top notch but Edward Norton's is by far the most entertaining and most likable roles of the entire movie. His character is so mind blowing and fascinating that it's so hard not to enjoy. As it's powerful and disturbing images are expressed through most parts of the film and it's character development being driven into a sophisticated environment, it makes the film more and more satisfying each time I watch it.

130,asda-man,X Marks The Spot,8,27 June 2011,"""American History X"" opens with our Hitler-loving, lispy Edward Norton shooting down two black people with a swastika tattooed across his chest which perfectly depicts the mood and theme for the entire film. I absolutely loved ""American History X"" and here's why.Tony Kaye directs this film to near perfection, right from the beautiful over-cranking shot in black and white (which cleverly outlines the battle between the blacks and the whites) to the intense rape scene in the shower, ""American History X"" deals with some intense subject matter and is also quite upsetting violent which is probably why it didn't win the Oscar for ""Best Picture"" although I'm pretty sure it deserved it.The cinematography is equally impressive and Edward Norton plays his character brilliantly and so does Edward Furlong as the confused teen heading down his older brother's path. What is great about this film is that it has an engaging story to tell and it tells it superbly through intelligent flashbacks and flawless directing. It deals with racism roughly, I mean that it doesn't hold back on shocking the audience which is good because it delivers a powerful punch by the time the credits role.The characterisation is superb and we get some really in-depth character analysis as well as well thought out scenes. I also found the screenplay remarkably impressive it's fast and intelligent and manages to build a believable story with an inspirational turn-around before a real bash of realism. The ending is incredibly emotional and thoughtful.""American History X"" is for anyone who appreciates good film-making. if you're after an action-filled fiscal noisy ride then stay away. This is intelligent, thoughtful and brave film-making at its best and would go as far to say this is a masterpiece",American History X
131,oOoBarracuda,American History X,2,29 December 2016,"American History X acted as my introduction to Tony Kaye and didn't leave me thirsting for any more of his work. The 1998 film, was his directorial debut, and that fact showed. The film stars Edward Norton as a former white supremacist reformed after a jail sentence who now wants to help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, avoid traveling the same path. What the film lacks in character depth it makes up for in its overarching moral message. American History X is devoid of all real human complexity in favor of the easy and overly simple message against racism without ever actually showing much in the way of race relations. Everything about American History X is safe, and safe films are rarely remembered years after their release.Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard, an easily mentally manipulated young man living in the increasingly diverse Venice Beach area of Los Angelis, California. Early one morning, Derek's brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) alerts his brother that his car is being broken into by ""some black guy"". Derek answers by loading a gun then heading outside in his underwear firing as soon as the door is open. Derek is arrested and sentenced to serve three years in prison. He bars his family and friends from visiting him while he is in prison, leaving everyone shocked when a completely transformed Derek emerges. When the white supremacist group that he used to head throws a party for his release, Derek wants no part of it and only attends the party to warn his former mentor to stay away from his brother and sever ties with everyone there. Derek's time is now spent trying to get his life back on track, find a job, and keep himself out of jail. His purpose, however, is to keep his brother, who idolizes Derek and watched his every move for years, out of the racism-fueled group that he fostered. He must impart his new-found enlightenment on his brother before it is too late. Aside from the glaring plot deficiencies, American History X is shot in a painful way. The heavy reliance on extreme close-up and often off-centered shots miss the grittiness the director may have been going for and is instead nauseating. The memories shot in black & white came off incredibly gimmicky and really didn't serve the advancement of the narrative in any way. The transition from black & white memories to present-day color shots was far from smooth and was rather distracting. American History X is not the type of film that requires a voice- over, yet, it was voiced-over throughout the entire film. Even if a film doesn't need a voice-over, it's easier to forgive if there is a succulent voice providing the narration; American History X does not have this either. There is a heavy reliance on the shots of this film to provide a shock factor, rather than the narrative itself which is indicative of poor directing when you're working with a plot as explosive as race relations. Back to the plot, the audience is told all throughout the film that Derek is smart, but we are never shown that. Twice through the movie, the audience is shown just how little it takes to emotionally and mentally manipulate Derek, leaving one to wonder if his ""transformation"" will even be permanent. The betrayal in the final scene may be just another manipulation to push Derek back to his old ways of vitriol hate. There's just not much to take away from Tony Kaye's feature film debut, which is disappointing considering that it could have been a masterclass in cinema, given its premise.",American History X
132,ronakkotian,Not entirely believable but Edward Norton steals the show,7,13 August 2021,"Edward Norton has been an underrated actor in my eyes. Delivering great performances in films like Fight Club, Birdman and Moonrise Kingdom, there's no doubt he's an outstanding actor. His performance in American History X is some of his best work.American History X follows Derek Vinyard, a former neo-nazi skinhead that tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did.The widespread love for this film got me interested to watch it. What I admire is how far they went with a subject matter like this. Its portrayal of racism is unflinching throughout with sequences that truly had me on edge and even shocked me. The film doesn't hold back and I found that to be helpful to get into and understand Derek Vinyard's perception of the world. The use of black and white during the flashbacks was an excellent choice as I felt it was very representative of the hatred and violent nature Derek possessed. Not only that, it added a murky feeling to the film that suited the dark and angry tone of the film. My main issue with American History X is how the film depicted Derek's reformation. Witnessing the large amount of hatred and racism built up inside of him, I found to be quite unbelievable how quick he was able to switch against his morals. For me, this weakened the film as this was the entire character development Derek had but it didn't come across as very believable. In addition, the ending is also something I'm not sure how I feel about. The best part of American History X is Edward Norton. He always manages to disappear into the characters he plays and Derek Vinyard is no exception. He lives and breathes this role and does an incredible job playing him. Edward Furlong as Norton's younger brother is also very good.American History X does have a lot of interesting things to say. The filmmaking is very well done and Edward Norton delivers an exceptional performance but I think the story required more subtlety and needed more to happen in Derek's life to make his reformation more believable in my eyes.",American History X

135,CinematicInceptions,Watch this.,9,24 April 2018,"If the feel-good movie is a genre, then this is the epitome of the feel-bad genre. I've seen plenty of movies that contain scenes that make me cringe because of their content, and many of them are great movies. But none of them, not even the brutal realism throughout Babel disturbed me as much in a good way as American History X. The curb stomp scene is possibly the most intense scene in any movie. After you see the violence in this movie, it definitely makes you look at some action movies in a different light.I would not call this one of my favorite movies, but it is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. No matter how little you've been affected by other movies, you will feel at least a little sick after watching this. However, I implore you to see it no matter who you are despite the disturbing levels of violence. There's a reason it's number 32 on the top 250, and that's because it's possibly the most insightful movie ever made.Going into this movie, I had always thought that white supremacists were just idiots that had no real reason for their extreme racism. But I had my view changed by this movie. Derek and Danny Vinyard, while not terribly educated are both smart characters and their racism is not blind. As a matter of fact, it is seductive, persuasive, and even understandable. It was scary how much reason I found in Derek's arguments, but the scenes in which we see why he believes what he believes are so engaging to watch. Unlike most movies that portray racial issues, this one is hardly one-sided. While the white supremacists are the antagonists, the black characters are hardly shown as saints. True they don't commit any heinous acts of violence on screen, but they are still shown as criminals in about equal measure to the white characters. The point of the movie is not to build up or tear down one race or another, it's just to show that all the racial hatred is a mentality that, while it may be seductive, cannot lead to anything good.It's a very emotional movie, which does not mean that it's all sad. Yes, it's mostly depressing in tone, but there are a few lighter and incredibly hopeful moments to balance it out. Because of the violence and rage and bleakness of the rest of the movie, scenes like Derek connecting with Lamont, and Derek and Danny tearing down the posters and pictures in their room are highlighted and are more uplifting.In terms of technical skill, it's done very well. Ed Norton's performance is amazing, and everyone else in the movie does pretty well too. Tony Kaye does a great job directing, making some unconventional but effective shots, like the extreme close-ups in the dinner scene between Derek and his father. Even the little decision for Danny to keep unconsciously rubbing his newly bald head was, I thought, a really good choice. I read that the movie was originally only 87 minutes and was extended by Ed Norton. Knowing this, I can see where some of the extensions may have been made, and while they aren't entirely necessary, they are included to good effect.If you are an American over the age of about 16 or 17, I would strongly recommend that you watch this, and probably watch it alone. You might not want to watch it again, but it is a very important movie that has a timeless theme about what hatred can do to an individual and a community. It does not directly comment on any of the racial problems that we face in our current state of affairs, but it is still pertinent to today's race related issues. It is understandable if you don't want to watch this, but there is not a good excuse not to. Overall Rating: 8.7/10.",American History X

Because of its subject matter, people like it because they think they SHOULD.  To dislike it might cause one to be perceived as being insensitive to racial issues, but anyone looking at this film with a critical eye will find that its shortcomings make it practically laughable.  The basketball scene itself is so silly, it single-handedly destroys any credibility this film might have had.  Others have already noted the unbelievable dinner and prison scenes as well.  A lifetime of hate - instant contrition.  How can anyone possibly take this thing seriously?

I have been looking forward to it since I last saw AHX in March this year (this is also my second comment on AHX). Well, so what did I think the second time? I have thought about AHX a lot since I saw it last, and it lived up to my memories of it. AHX is without a doubt one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The experience of watching this film completely drains me, I get very emotionally involved in what happens to the Vinyard  family (Derek and Danny in particular, of course). I could go on and on about how brilliant this film, but I will try to keep it short; I have nothing bad to say about this film, some of the flaws that other people has brought up here at IMDb is too small for me to care about, I'm aware of a few of these flaws but as the film is so powerful and brilliant I just don't care about that. A movie is not only about what is there in the script, it's about what you feel when you watch it, and AHX will definitely make you feel something. Edward Furlong is very good in this film, it's probably his best performance ever, I do believe that he's even better than he was in ""American Heart"".Edward Norton is absolutely brilliant! His performance as Derek Vinyard is awe-inspiring, how he did not win the Oscar he was nominated for is beyond me. Not only is his performance awe-inspiring, it's almost surreal as well, because how could anyone be that good? Edward Norton is one of the reasons to watch this film. Even if the premise does not seem interesting to you I think you should see AHX anyway because Norton's performance will blow you away.(10/10)",American History X

It is thought provoking, superbly written, superbly directed, and not to mention the brilliant acting by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Some scenes are very shocking, but they need to be there. Having seen this movie another neo-Nazi movie immediately springs to mind: the Australian 'Romper Stomper' (1992). I think that 'American History X' is the best of the two since it is more analyzing and less violent, and the acting is much better (not to say that the cast of 'Romper Stomper' is bad though). Norton is without a doubt the best actor right now, and Furlong is certainly almost as good.",American History X

People in jail loose their basic rights and yet rather than making jail the ultimate rehab ,harder than all the rest, it's set up to encourage racial divide and return rates. I inquired about an old friend who is in jail now and the response was 'he's gay now because he is in jail' I mean seriously America what the F? It's hard not to come away with all sorts of anger .

141,bat-5,Edward Norton is amazing,8,30 January 2000,"As you watch Ed Norton in the role that garnered him a nomination for best actor, you realize that you are watching acting of a caliber that hasn't been seen since the glory days of Marlon Brando and the early works of Robert DeNiro.  Norton virtually vanishes into this role.  He is scary.  With the shaved head, bulked up physique and tattoos dotted across his torso, he comes across as truly menacing.  The real strength in this role comes from Norton's convictions.  When he rallies his fellow white supremacists into a raid on a grocery store, you believe him.  Then when he returns from prison, you see a totally different person.  You see the pain and sorrow that has cost him three years of his life.   When Norton looks into the mirror and sees the giant swastika emblazened on his chest, you see in his eyes a look of regret.   Edward Furlong is also good in the role of the younger brother who is headed on the same path of destruction that his older brother was on.   All the performances in this film are top notch. The film is hard to watch at times.  The violence and the hate mongering that Norton perpetrates is tough to stomach, but in the end, Norton's character is redeemed.  He has seen the error of his ways and he hopes to keep his brother out of the life that took so much from him and his family.",American History X

143,rajatdahiyax,Norton's astounding performance!!!!!!,9,19 August 2014,"American History X is a 1998 American crime drama film directed by Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. It stars Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, and co-stars Fairuza Balk, Stacy Keach, Elliott Gould, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee and Beverly D'Angelo.In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are inter cut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek",American History X

146,TaylorYee94,Compelling message: Hatred is baggage. Someone has to stop this circle of violence.,9,14 October 2021,"What dose it mean to be American? Illegal immigrants. Are they Americans or not? If not, U. S constitution and laws do not apply to them or are not responsible to protect their freedom? How about looking at this issue with humanity? Is it right to use violence or discriminate because they are not U. S citizens? What if immigrants from Europe? Do people treat them the same way as they treat the ones who are looted by Cameron's gang? In 'American History X', who is right, and who is wrong? Can one pick just one side completely? Do you think Derek will go back to being so hateful and enraged after Denny's death just like after the death of his father, thinking 'I was so right about these people. Blacks are parasite to the society'? What will happen to the student who shot Denny? Will he have the moment of awareness or epiphany as Derek did? Can one even classify or define a person based on ethnicity? Does certain race of people behave in certain way? Or is it because people with the same race share similar backgrounds such as neighborhood, economic status, and education? Is affirmative action actually fair when a better candidate for the job has to sacrifice because of a quota left for certain ethnicity? So many questions pop up endlessly for an hour even after finishing the movie. It means 'American History X' is effective and powerful. Rather than telling a story black and white or crystal clear who are good guys or bad guys, the film shows what's happening out there sharply and honestly but with delicately controlled story development. It is audience's job to watch, feel, observe, analyze, and solve. Gosh, it becomes more attractive because it does not just hand out answers, one has to look for it.'American History X' abstains from labeling the characters: skinheads, neo-Nazis, Facists, or white supremacists. They sound so far from the audience. They are just Cameron's gang one can encounter from time to time so near our neighborhood. Through Derek, the movie gives mighty message that 'what can be learned can be unlearned. From his history, his father, and how he is to despise the colored and to feel deprived by equal treatment with 'inferiors' to his awareness of himself and of society, his future, and his lesson learnt passed on to younger brother, Derek changes slowly but dramatically. The movie provides deeper analysis of a character than simply labeling him just like how complicated racial issues and violence are in real life.Juxtaposing Nazi flag & American Flag is one of the most shocking and daring images in film history. Derek looking himself in the mirror and covering swastika in the similar pose when American soldiers put their hand on the chest during national anthem is the most metaphorical and brilliant image as well. Two flags which represent two opposite ideas: freedom & liberty and totalitarianism existing in the same place, overlapping from one scene to the next, and being worshipped by the same people portrays this great irony in American society. How can one beats this to be more realistic, forceful, and ominous.Norton's acting, charisma, and magic (whatever the heck he does) have consumed me for full two hours. It is charismatic enough to lead dense story with so much energy, and he brings 100% of audience with him. He does not let one's even little self stay behind in the seats of theater. Just Mesmerizing. He never lets me down. Rather he goes beyond talents shown in his previous works to surprise audience.",American History X
147,emperor_bender,A film that shows both sides to Neo Nazism,9,20 February 2009,"Nowadays there is more than enough hate in this country. Racism is probably one of the most bitter roots of this hate.American History X shows us the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who is one of the most provoking individuals of hatred as a Neo Nazi. His hatred started when his father Dennis (William Russ) was murdered by African Americans. His hate heavily affects his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo) and younger sister Davina (Jennifer Lien). He is even hateful toward his mom's new Jewish lover, Murray (Elliott Gould).However, we also see Derek's transformation to the other side, who are disgusted with all of this hate. His younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) takes after his brother's hateful ways a little too well and falls in with the Neo Nazi crowd with Derek's old buddy Seth (Ethan Suplee) and his ex girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk). Derek challenges the group led by Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) and their hateful ways. However, Danny soon is told how bad his ways are when confronted by his principal, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and asked to attend his personal history class, American History X.The movie has a lot of bitter moments and is hard to watch at times, but it thoroughly gets the message across about hatred and racism.9/10.",American History X
148,Bogey Man,Powerful depiction of racism,9,8 October 2002,"Tony Kaye's extremely impressive feature film directorial debut AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998) is a film one necessarily wouldn't expect to come from today's Hollywood too often. A strong and harrowing depiction of racism and rotten minds who feed it and keep it alive in ""civilized"" society. The film is written by David McKenna who has since written films like Blow.Edward Norton and Edward Furlong play brothers in AMERICAN HISTORY X, a brothers who have been taught to support racism since they were just teenagers. Then their father gets killed in the line of duty and Derek, the older (Norton), decides it was all because of blacks and other non-white American people who live in their neighbourhood as well as in the whole America, too. He turns into real devil in the form of human being and starts a gang in their neighbourhood to destroy all the ""parasites, immigrants.."" and becomes hugely popular skinhead leader who is hugely admired by Danny, the younger brother (Furlong). Then a horrific act of violence takes place and things start to take new directions..Rarely have I seen a film about racism made this restrainedly but still extremely harrowingly and memorably. The actors are of course great and Oscar worthy, but the screenplay is the most important thing. There's no humor or lightening elements and the ending is definitely not a traditionally happy and ""it was just a movie"" like. The ending is there to strike the viewers even more effectively and force us think and realize. Especially the last speech is important and thickens it all.
Also the acts and ""opinions"" of the skinheads are written with care and the film doesn't moralize anything which is great. The skinheads really believe in their thing that all other than non-white/American citizens need to be killed, hurt or otherwise destroyed and removed. When I listen to them I cannot but admire the work of the scriptwriter; even the real skinheads should stop and think do they really want to look so pathetic and ridiculous because they ARE realistically depicted in this film.The music is powerful and sad and makes the images even more powerful and stunning. Kaye is also a cinematographer in this film and it shows as he captures some nice landscapes and uses B&W photography very effectively. There are many extreme close ups of character heads and face expressions which really show how serious all the characters, racists and non-racists, are and I cannot find single one irritating or unnecessary role or actor in this film. The ending is unexpected and very sad. The violence in the ending is also very fierce but it is pretty much symbolic and makes the man who grabs the gun really see what has now been done by him and why. The film includes some very strong scenes of violence but they are never even distantly exploitative or gratuitous but realistic and thus so painful to watch. This is the kind of film which can make viewer turn the eyes off the screen at some points and that is a sign that the message has been delivered and will stay haunting inside the viewer mind and that is also one thing from which a remarkably powerful movie can be recognized.Tony Kaye's film is easily among the greatest and most important Hollywood films of the 1990's. It can be seen universally and won't lose its power too easily during years and as long as this kind of wickedness takes place in the world everyday, these films remain as important as when they were released and should also be seen by many people who don't necessarily understand how serious these things really are not only in this film but in real world, too. Films like this are for everybody and concern everybody. 9/10",American History X

A dinner table rant was more powerful in defending our reformed skin heads' view of the results of liberal government than was the quiet shaking of the head by the true adults. You also can't write below your audiences' level and cover it up with a diatribe just because it is raw and brutal. This contrived plot uses an artificial good guy (black teacher) and an impossible good guy (older brother who, three years prior, curb stomped a black car thief he had already shot numerous times) to oppose the beach side community of hate. When tackling the Grand Canyon of social issues in Racism, you better understand your audience who knows that it takes an army of time and thoughtfulness to change mob mentality.

Well, apart from showing that anyone can change, we get an accurate look into the minds of the people who have submitted to this insanity called racism. How one leader is enough to brainwash and put ideas in gullible people's mind and make them believe it so much they'd kill for it.

153,ericrnolan,"I'm glad I watched ""American History X"" (1998).",9,29 September 2014,"It's a good, smart, enjoyable film. I learned from it.I'd really rather not discuss its social or political messages. One glance at an online discussion of this movie shows that they're divisive and often ugly. (There are even ongoing debates about which gangs or groups should rightly be called ""Skinheads,"" and which are racist.) I'm just not in the mood for controversy this morning. I'd rather just tell you what I thought about AHX as a film.This movie had a lot of great things going for it, but two things stood out in particular. The first was Edward Norton's tour de force performance. I've liked Norton elsewhere, like ""Red Dragon,"" where he was good. Here, he's phenomenal. He's goddam frightening as Neo-nazi Derek. (He reminded me of Bill Moseley's turn as ""Otis Driftwood"" in ""House of 1,000 Corpses."") Then we see him as a redeemed man. Then, through flashbacks, he's made even more human and three-dimensional, as we see a sensitive young teenager traumatized by the death of his father. Norton was so damned good that I still seem to have trouble believing that the same actor played all three roles. I don't pretend to be a film expert; reviews like this are just a hobby. But I think I know great acting when I see it, and this was great acting.The second was a really smart script. Again, I learned from this. I always assumed that Neo-Nazis were poorly educated nuts from the fringes of society. As it turns out, they actually do have an ideology, albeit a horrible and misguided one. This movie makes a very smart move in scripting Derek and his younger brother as ""brilliant"" students, who articulate facts and motivations for doing odious things. Listening to Derek's tirades (including one cringe- inducing scene at a dinner-table) actually sheds light on what motivates the characters' real-life counterparts.Only two small things occurred to me that made this film a little less perfect than so many others have claimed it to be. First, this movie doesn't even know the meaning of subtlety. Its message and delivery were so heavy handed that it was almost an ABC afterschool special. We even have an overly convenient framing device – Derek's adulating brother, Danny (played wonderfully by Edward Furlong), is asked by an African American history teacher to write a report on Derek's life. The superior film, ""Crash"" (2004,) for example, handled racism with a hell of a lot more finesse and surprises.Second, one character arc was way too quick and implausible. After one conversation with his redeemed older brother, Danny also disavows the Neo-nazi movement? After years of propaganda and socialization by the group? I'm not so sure a disturbed, fascist teenager can be deprogrammed so easily. Did anyone else who saw this movie wonder about this as well?Still, this was a great film. I'd give it a 9 out of 10. One final note – the ending quote by Abraham Lincoln was just beautiful. I'd actually heard only snippets of it sampled by films before – once in ""Apocalypse Now"" and once in ""X2: X-Men United."" It's better in its entirety.",American History X
154,backup-50362,The most un-Hollywood movie in 2021,9,23 June 2021,"Because the narrative is so far twisted nowadays by the puppeteer US media that you'll never see a movie like this ever again. This is the only good modern movie on this subject.It shows both sides' struggles and both sides' prejudice. It shows everyone's ugly side, and how we're all sadly equal in all of this garbage.It doesn't pretend that white kids aren't subjected to violent racism just like it happens to black kids.Which is all the things modern cringey Hollywood woke movies will never show. That's a difference between a cash grab and a genuine story that also has a moral lesson to teach.It shows that boys growing without fathers is damaging, regardless if they're black or white. That's an issue noone seems to be addressing nowadays, yet it's related to many, many problems in America. The fact that politicians and MSM want to push a narrative where fathers aren't needed.It also shows how disloyal *hoars* are, and your ""gang bros"" really, no matter your race. The second you stop conforming to them - you're the enemy.If you're a guy - you don't have friends. You can sometimes rely on your family at best, but that's not always the case either.It shows how men get sexually assaulted too, it shows that blaming others and taking zero responsibility leads nowhere. That being a punk who doesn't think but acts based on primitive ego-driven ""morals"" will land you in prison. Ruin your life, as you ruin someone else's. That's what happens to many men every year. That's how the movie ends.And somehow, this one single movie managed to portray all of this in less than two hours.Whatever, I doubt anyone will watch this in 2021 and understand it. It's a great movie. Great actors too. And genuinely, clearly driven by true experiences. It's not a make-believe ""woke"" fantasy or pandering so that advertisers and low-IQ viewers like it and praise it. Just brutally real.The only thing I don't like is how slow it is sometimes, and the ending... But I guess that's the point. None of this leads to a happy ending, for anyone involved.

In terms of technical aspects Kayne's great to show the Flashbacks of our protagonist in black and white, and highlight the timeline, he wants to make us remember World War II, meaning that all such discrimination is a thing of the past, and narrative off of Danny and the family unit is great, because if we saw the film without these two aspects we do not apegaríamos Derek, on the contrary, we'd hate, and hate is the opposite of what the film wants to preach, we we can not agree with Derek, but if we hate, we are not very different, the soundtrack is accurate, the picture is beautiful, especially in black and white times, the script is extremely intelligent, but leave some loose ends, and the performances are all great, especially Edward Norton, who is a great actor, but unlike the majority of his other films where he has a submissive and apathetic performance, not here, he is threatening, you really afraid, and yet he can pass the dramatic side, this is certainly one of the greatest performances of his career.

158,mOVIemAN56,"Powerful, emotional, stirring, amazing",10,25 May 2007,"American History X has gone down as one of the most brilliants works of art in the past twenty years. Focusing on the subject of racism and Neo-Nazism within the United States along with the questions of affirmative action and illegal immigration. The film holds nothing back. I have never seen a film so balanced. What I mean by balanced is how the dialog, the story, the acting, and the characters are all amazing and brilliant equally. It is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen on the subject of racism.Derek is one of the most feared Neo-Nazi leaders in Los Angeles. He holds nothing back when expressing his beliefs. If he needs to kill, if he needs to destroy, if he needs to harm, he'll do it just to see what according to him is right is accomplished. But after a brutal three year stint in prison for the murder of two black men, Derek's only fear is that his brother will follow down the same path as he once did. Ed Norton stars as Derek in a film of redemption and acceptance of one another.Ed Norton is one of the best actors around. He held nothing back for American History X. He became the crazed, racist, mislead Derek that we see in the film. His performance is one of the most memorable performances by an actor in the past 25 years. The ending scene will bring tears to your eyes as Derek's ultimate horror finally comes about in startling fashion. When someone says ""Norton was the key to this films success"" they are right.Edward Furlong is strong as Derek's younger brother. He makes you believe that Danny is being influenced by his brother. He makes his character to be innocent yet dangerous. We see the true human side of people through him and his misguided beliefs. We come to understand him and the dark side of Neo-Nazism through Furlong's character. The chemistry between Furlong and Norton is very strong and very believable though not nearly as memorable as Norton's.The film is seriously intense. Language is flying at every corner. There isn't any drug use which seems to be common in every gang movie today. I liked this because drugs seem to always be the focal point when it comes to gang films. Instead of focusing on drugs and things, the film focuses on the beliefs of the Neo-Nazi's and how in trying to strengthen society, they have all but divided it more. They have just brought more violence with their beliefs and the film stands as stark opposition to anyone who is racist or discriminative.Tony Kaye disowned the film after it was released. I still don't know why. The film is brilliant and mostly because of him and the work he did on it. The dialog, the characters, the story is all memorable in my book. I have trouble finding a better lead actor then Edward Norton. I have trouble finding a more complex character then Derek Vinyard, and I have trouble finding a more believable and brutal story the American History X. It is by far one of the best films of the 90's.5/5 Stars",American History X
159,squeezebox,Would be a great movie if not for the awful ending,7,19 April 2005,"American HISTORY X is, in general, an excellent movie. The screenplay, performances and direction are all first rate. Unfortunately, the movie jumps its track in its final moments, with an ending that, when one thinks about it, negates the entire movie! SPOILER ALERT!!! The moment I saw Edward Furlong appear on screen, I knew he would be dead by the end of the movie. I knew this movie couldn't possibly have a happy ending, or even a remotely uplifting one. I also figured out that the young black kid with whom Furlong had a run-in would be the one to kill him.My problem is, what's the point of the movie with this ending? I thought the movie was about redemption and enlightenment. But it seems to me that the message of the movie is that redemption and enlightenment are either impossible or useless. By the time you realize the error of your ways, it will undoubtedly be too late.Also, the fact that Furlong is killed by a black kid whom he attempted to intimidate doesn't sit well with me. What are the filmmakers saying? Racism will turn a white kid into an angry delinquent, but will turn a black kid into a murderer? That's a real positive message to get people to question the stereotype of all young black men as gun wielding gang members.I'll praise this movie with a 7 out of 10, because I think the bulk of the movie is excellent. But the handling of the ending is sloppy, lazy and, yes, racist storytelling. I agree Edward Norton's character had to pay for his sins, but the way in which they have it happen practically affirms his Neo-Nazi beliefs.I have a feeling that's NOT the message the filmmakers wanted to convey.",American History X

Norton and Furlong are utterly believable as is the whole cast.  Instead of being parodied or mocked, the white supremacist are made believable and the legitimate social, economic, and cultural issues that underlie their despicable beliefs are made real and believable. Many movies about racism oversimplify the complex social dynamics.  American History X makes one think about those social dynamics and confront them.

Problem is the outline of the story gives away too much, so I'll say this: Norton is a nazi-skinhead who despises 'foreigners' because they apparently leech off his country's government and cause American 'natives' to go without. Truth is he is just a racist who hates anyone who isn't a white christian. The movie is about how he justifies this existence and causes his own brother to follow the same path.

162,XxEthanHuntxX,American Lessons,8,14 February 2020,"This film is not exactly reflecting the time or place I live in but it really doesn't matter because the film explains it very clear. The film is a very interesting story about the trouble of the American society, which is of course very sad and unfortunately but is an important concern. The film's character, Derek, is a very well constructed character, and at least I can sort of chare his opinion and understand his thoughts through the film, and while his opinion changes, mine does too and I start thinking my self, its a really cool happening, with lack of a better word, and really caught me off guard.The film is very well done and doesn't have many bad scenes, in my opinion, I think the characters and their personality is fantastically done and acted, they were super realistic. This film has some really tough, powerful,violent scenes which I as a teenager liked, but It also had some emotional and sentimental scenes which I also really liked(like the last event, very good). I feel like both of these elements were very important elements for the film.So I think this is a very well written and directed film, and I really recommend it. It got allot of wise life advice and really got your thinking with a little eye-opener. This film also is like the group System of A Down, which is one of my favourite bands, they pretty much spread the same message I suppose. Everything in this film is important and well-orchestrated, I understand why this film is so highly rated.",American History X

Of course, they also have bad things to do. But who are you at fault? Maybe it is the poor who are alone, and the rich are the best. Use your own ability to change the people around you, change the people around you, and all beings are equal.
The racial issue has always been a pain in the hearts of Americans. Although we have seen progress from the liberation of slaves to Martin Luther King to now Obama, we have seen many innocent lives and lives on this difficult journey. The painful soul was trampled and trampled. From the teachings of Wen Ya's father to him, he can fully see the deep-rooted discrimination in some white people. When he reflected on himself from reality and reassessed his previous value judgment, the contradictory resentment accumulated by the two races for many years made the tragedy come again. We don't know what kind of entanglement will make him choose. There is still a long way to go before trying to eliminate the suspicions of race.
Looking back at us, it seems that ethnic contradictions are not so sharp, but is this really the case? I am a protected and sheltered instant gainer. Tibetans and Xinjiang people have no way of knowing their inner feelings, but they can understand their anger or helplessness even from very sporadic messages. What is more terrible is that we cannot sort it out as slowly as the United States, and gradually repair and make up. We can only watch everything happen and fall to the abyss with everyone.",American History X
164,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Just great,9,17 June 2008,"Perhaps the highest compliment you can pay to Edward Norton is that his Oscar-nominated performance in American History X nearly convinces you that there is a shred of logic in the tenets of white supremacy. If that statement doesn't horrify you, it should; Norton is so fully immersed in his role as a new-Nazi skinhead that his character's eloquent defense of racism is disturbingly persuasive--at least on the surface. Looking lean and mean with a swastika tattoo and a mind full of hate, Derek Vinyard (Norton) has inherited racism from his father, and that learning has been intensified through his service to Cameron (Stacy Keach), a grown-up thug playing tyrant and teacher to a growing band of disenfranchised teens from Venice Beach, California, all hungry for an ideology that fuels their brooding alienation. The film's basic message--that hate is learned and can be unlearned--is expressed through Derek's kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), whose sibling hero-worship increases after Derek is imprisoned (or, in Danny's mind, martyred) for the killing of two black men. Lacking Derek's gift of rebel rhetoric, Danny is easily swayed into the violent, hateful lifestyle that Derek disowns during his thoughtful time in prison. Once released, Derek struggles to save his brother from a violent fate, and American History X partially suffers from a mix of intense emotions, awkward sentiment, and predictably inevitable plotting. And yet British director Tony Kaye (who would later protest against Norton's creative intervention during post-production) manages to juggle these qualities--and a compelling clash of visual styles--to considerable effect. No matter how strained their collaboration may have been, both Kaye and Norton can be proud to have created a film that addresses the issue of racism with dramatically forceful impact.",American History X
165,flicklover,This film will make you think!!!!,9,13 May 2001,"This is a film that uses imagery to make its statements, it is not a subtle view of racism in America. The focus of the film has to do with what effect hate can have on a family.Edward Norton's performance is as powerful a performance as I have ever seen. His character is not presented as a monster, but as an intelligent kid that is smart enough to know that what he preaches is wrong, but circumstances in his life fill him with anger and hate.The movie does want to hammer home its anti racism message, to some it may seem as manipulative, but the images are so well done that it is hard not to feel a reaction. The movie would have been well served if the other characters were as fleshed out as Norton's character Derek. Norton's brother is played by Edward Furlong, his performance is good, but he is really more important as the film's narrator. The skinheads in the film are by and large shown as mindless racist drones. But I think that it is the film's point that intelligent kids like Derek is what these organizations need for recruitment.The film is not subtle, it WANTS to get under our skin. Derek's eventual change of heart is dealt with too superficially though, it would have been good to focus on that a little more. Though the film is not perfect it is undeniably powerful, its best trait is that whether one likes it or not, it is a film that will cause discussion, some of the images will stay with you long after the film ends.",American History X

American History X is a fine blend of drama and thriller, a story behind the leader of a neo-nazi cultist Derek Vinyard (Norton), seen from the eyes of his younger brother Danny (Furlong). AHX flicks from flashbacks of Derek's rise (head of a cult) and fall (murder), and rise again (redemption), to his present day atonement. Derek's crime is one of the most violent off-screen acts in cinema history. Danny looks up to his older brother, slowly but surely following his footsteps. It's down to Derek to put things right. This film sticks to the back of the mind, because the representation of its immoral actions are heavy, powerful and a harsh kick on reality regarding hate-crime.",American History X

168,refresh_daemon,Good enough to merit watching,8,30 September 2006,"I've always been meaning to watch this film, after hearing so much about it. Now that I have, I see what people like about the film, but at the same time, find some issues with it. Nevertheless, I really like the film still.It's easy to point out the good in the film: good performances, daring to handle a tough topic, even direction. So on and so forth. It's a mostly solid film. But it has its weaknesses too.Here are some of the issues: The story pushes a little too hard for the things that happen in the film.Spoilers follow Having the protagonist bond with the laundry guy was a little too convenient and a little too easy. Not that I don't believe it could happen, but based on the protagonist's character, it's asking a lot for the relationship have so little conflict. Also, the protagonist is supposed to be smart and a rallier of his peers. When he's in prison, he seems to lose his smarts, or they get put under his ""ideals"", which wasn't immediately convincing. His moral dilemma is also a tough sell, because we don't get to spend enough time with him getting confused.End spoilers In that sense, the film asks the viewers to make some large leaps of faith and I wasn't entirely convinced. The other issue is the ending of the film. The film goes on too long and the end-drama doesn't seem necessary and even goes to the point of being a little over-the-top. A little more editing would've helped the ending be less melodramatic.Nonethelss, it's good enough to merit watching. And I liked it despite my small frustrations. 8/10",American History X

It often tastes like sugar candy, and yet again, like Scotch Whisky. There are periods of sick....racism....but that never appears to be real. The key scenes when the Edward Norton character faces up to the Stacey Keach big boss Nazi horror....are under-developed. If your going to make a movie about black / white neo racism you need to come up with something better than this. This was made in 1998 and it feels like 1962.

Edward Norton gives a great performance as Derek Vineyard the former neo-nazi released from prison who has changed forever and Edward Furlong is just as good as his trouble younger brother Danny. The rest of the cast including Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Stacey Keach, Fairuza Balk, and Elliot Guild are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie has brutal violence, pervasive strong language, a graphic sex scene early on and then a rape, and nudity so parents should be warned to watch this first before allowing their children to see it. American History x is a powerful film and as mentioned before it's hard to watch at times but this is one movie that shouldn't be missed.

It could have been a *great* movie, but it turned out to be merely a decent one.  I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't really liked the picture.  There was some real potential in this film, and the potential was never realized.  Roger Ebert sums up my views very well in his review.  It's always rather painful to see a movie that ""wants to take off and soar"" end up sitting on the ground (albeit sitting very well).  I also agree with Ebert that the fault was mainly in the direction.  If the movie had a great director, it would have been a great film.

This film is not a feel-good movie, but one that will challenge you and ask questions about the world we live in How do we approach social prejudice?

176,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,an excellent profile on racism in the modern world,10,3 August 2006,"Led by two of the strongest performances around, 1998's 'American History X' is one of the films you need to watch in your life. Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead who, after a life changing stint in jail, tries to prevent his brother (Edward Furlong) from taking the same path. The film is brilliantly directed by Tony Kaye, as he catches every emotion that Ed Norton conveys in his performance. Kaye captures the mood and emotion very well here. He makes a lot out of this film, and it remains one of my favorites. Ed Norton's performance is simply brilliant in every sense of the word. He captures the essence of evil, while at the same time providing a likable character. He plays the strong Vinyard to perfection. Ed Furlong's performance is excellent for what he's given. He's given the brooding and potentially one dimensional character, and turns it into a deep, confused, and potentially volatile young man that is easily influenced. American History X remains one of my favorite movies because it displays how racism can effect an entire family. I cannot stress how good and moving this film is, and this is possible because of Norton, Furlong, and Kaye. Beware this film if you're younger, though, because there is strong, strong racism, racial stimulated gore and violence, nudity and sex, and the worst of it all, a rape scene. Not for anyone under 17. If you see one film from 1998, see American History X.10/10 --spy",American History X
177,tributarystu,Nearing perfection...,9,29 November 2002,"American History X is one of the saddest, one of the most moral and definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything, from the subject of the movie, to the actors is nearing perfection(as we know: nothing's and no one's perfect beside God). The actual fact, that the movie's theme is as real as it can get is a strong point. These are things which probably are still happening everywhere. It doesn't matter if it's black, yellow or red. It happens everywhere.    Unfortunately, the brilliance of this movie seems to not have been understood or accepted by some people, and I'm thinking especially about the people who award the well known Academy Awards. But, let's be serious: does a movie have to be recognized by a hand of people to be good?    From the beginning to the end of the movie you shall feel the intensity of the things that are happening. You shall tremble, and you shall fear. You shall think and you shall see, that maybe you know these things. Or, maybe not. It's a thrilling walk, through our present world. It's something you might not understand. It's something you might not accept. It's that fact that some people do think the way it's presented in the movie. Maybe one of those is reading this. I'm sure that those people will say the movie sucked. And maybe it did for them. You can choose to either be as blind as.or to be as open minded as  Derek. It's your choice. And whatever you will do, you will have to say it before God. Of course, for these people the only problem is: God does not exist. As proven, it's not a lost cause, and you can always turn around. There's one point of view out of which I fear this movie probably failed. If it's only purpose was to entertain, then it's merits are sky high. But, if it had the objective to change the way some people are thinking, I doubt it succeeded. That's what I believe. Sadly, the movie only repeats the things most of the people know. It can be less impressive for some, out of a simple reason: It shows you reality, a reality in which you live in, but a reality which you already know. Or think you know. The fact that at the end Danny dies, killed by a black kid will leave a big question open: what will Derek do? What will he do now, after his second relative is killed by a black personhe might turn back to his old waysit remains an open question, and the answer will depend on each persons character. I myself, believe that he shall not stray on the wrong path again. Despite that fact that all you learn, can be unlearned, I think that after the lesson he got in prison, he will not waste his life without doing anything good for him, his family, or any other person.    Now to the cinematic part. I think Edward Norton was simply amazing! He fit so well in his role and he acted so flawlessly that he would have deserved a tiny, tiny bit of the Oscar. Of course, Roberto Benigni's acting was as good as Norton's, and it's very hard for me to choose a winner. I would go though on Benigni, because I have a good feeling when American awards are handed over to non English speaking people. I mean people who don't have English as their native language of course.      Norton though is one of the actors which will have( if you don't want to say he already has) a shining career as an actor.        Edward Furlong showed some impressive skills, and surely deserves to be called a great hope of modern cinematography.        I would like to end the review here, because there isn't much more to say to it. This movie should be seen without hesitation by everyone, because it can be a lesson. And I ask, can a movie be brilliant if it doesn't effect the viewers' lives?    Rating? 9.5/10",American History X

179,illbebackreviews,"'American History X' is a superbly acted, rich and emotional story that is sure to leave everyone happy and sad at the end",9,27 January 2013,"As part of my challenge to see all the movies on IMDb's Top 250, I randomly decided to check out 'American History X' which is a movie I've been rather interested in seeing. Going into the movie, I wasn't sure if this would be a good movie or a bad movie or simply just a little disappointing. I had no clue what to expect. I can say, as the first scene ended, I had a huge smile on my face and was soaked into the movie.American History X is the tale of two brothers, Derek and Danny Vinyard. Derek Vinyard is the leader of a street gang who attempt to bring equality amongst the black and white people as well as dominating over them. Sent to jail, his younger brother Danny becomes much like him and so, Derek must try to stop his brother from following his trails. Despite that being the plot of the movie, this story is far more deeper in every way. I cared so much about Derek Vinyard as well as his brother Danny. The way the director made Derek both a criminal trying to simply achieve justice amongst the two races as well as such a caring brother and son to the family was what made him such a great character. You could tell that he simply didn't want his brother to become the person he did. The director did a fantastic job giving such a rich history to these two characters.The acting in the movie by Edward Norton is probably his best performance, yes I enjoy this performance more than Fight Club. He was absolutely fantastic stealing scene after scene he was in, which is pretty much the whole movie. Edward Furlong, John Connor from Terminator 2, does an absolute fine job playing his younger brother. I do not care what people say, Furlong is a good actor.The cinematography in the movie is far superior to most movies that came around during that time. The idea of black and white for past events was clever and easily helps you understand the movie and the two are easily distinguished. The music in the movie is very good, but of course, in this type of movie, the soundtrack isn't important. For a drama to succeed, the characters and story have to be interesting, and this film easily accomplishes that.During the movie, I kept guessing what would be the next thing to happen but every time I was surprised at the way the director took this movie. The film is just under two hours, but seriously, this movie felt a good half hour shorter. This happens when you love a movie.***SPOILERS*** The way American History X ended with Danny being shot in the school bathroom was shocking. It was simply that sad due to the performance that Furlong gave and the character's developed story. The way it ended with Danny narrating how the two races weren't supposed to ever fight but to be friends to each other was perhaps one of the finest endings to a movie ever. Seeing Derek mourn for the loss of his brother was shocking.****ENDING SPOILERS*** Overall, to sum it up, American History X is definitely a must see movie for movie fans however isn't recommended to those under the age of 13 due to the racism in this movie. That being said, those who haven't seen this movie, please do so now as you will be pleasantly surprised and how good this movie exactly is. If you don't see it, its your own personal loss...",American History X
180,basrutten,Impressive,10,16 January 2002,"This is a very impressive movie. I think it gives a fairly realistic view into the world and ideas of ""white power"" and neo-nazism, although it's true that you could also get that view from watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel. However, this movie also succeeds very well at showing how nonsensical and futile those ideas are, and makes a very strong statement against racism. Furthermore, the acting in this movie is really top-class, and the movie is shot in a way that makes everything look very realistic, right down to the blood and gore. Also, this movie has a remarkable ending compared to most Hollywood movies that always have an extremely happy end.
The only complaint I have about this movie is that Edward Norton's character's move away from neo-nazism while he was in prison happened a bit too sudden: no real insight into his motives way given. This is a minor complaint however, which doesn't stop me from giving this movie ***1/2 out of **** stars",American History X

Norton immerses him-self so well within the role that you forget the past measly characters he has done and focus on this muscle bound skin-head before you! The film is shot beautifully and told through black and white flashbacks which let us into the world on Derek and Danny as we see the traumatic events that shape and change their lives forever and not to mention the beyond repair damage that they go through. Although the film might be basic, it has a very hard hitting message about hate , no matter what colour or background it comes from but still leaves us with no easy answers or comfortable conclusions. This movie truly must be a top one to watch for people who don't normally watch movies anyhow let alone be on the top 100 films to watch before I die list. All performance from Norton to Furlong even to Suplee were nothing short of excellent not to mention the score which is superb from Anne Dudley.

Edward Norton blows me away with the rage and passion he brings to parts.  I work with lots of teens and I have seen some of this rage- and the movie is right on target for what happens when rage is not dissipated. AHX is an important film showing how teachers can affect the lives of their pupils as well as parents-- like the song from South Pacific ""you've got to be taught to hate"" and that is what Derek's dad did- but others taught him to be tolerant.

184,stevenfallonnyc,Very overrated but not bad,6,17 April 2006,"I finally saw the famous ""American History X"" and while it was a decent movie, I'm reading here that it is one of the greatest films ever made? Maybe the greatest ever made? Wow, those are some accolades. I'm thinking, hey it was decent, but are you kidding me? The film isn't bad, but no matter how one tries to disguise it, preachy is preachy. There are a few things not too evident in the film. One is how many ""typical"" Americans totally concur with the societal views of Norton's character, especially everything he said at the dinner table. Maybe people don't want another Hitler around, but millions do feel the way he did about immigrants and why America has been falling into the toilet. So when they come out the mouth with a guy with a huge swastika tattooed on his body, they appear to be ""extreme."" Considering that even right now, at this second,with racism so high among non-whites towards whites, and many millions of Americans being tired of the advantages illegal immigrants have for instance, those views aren't always so ""extreme"" after all.And the racism in the film - it's predominantly white-on-black, and again, since the whites here are skinheads and Nazis, their views seem ""extreme"" despite the millions that agree (again, short of reviving Hitler). It is rare we see black-on-white racism in the movie, and even when we hear (or see in the deleted scenes) that the leader and the fat guy got attacked by blacks, they don't get too much sympathy from the viewer. The black kid in the final violent scene probably came the closest to showing any black racism, muttering the phrase ""white boy"" earlier in the film and getting in Danny's face.The turnaround of Norton's character in the prison is just too convenient. The film even gets a little sappy here - watch the neo-nazi lighten up to his black cleaning partner, because the black guy does funny things and makes him laugh. It's almost like this black guy was there for Norton's amusement, putting on a minstrel show, even wearing a sheet over his head imitating a klansman and making funny sounds. Look, now they are even talking about basketball together! If you spend one-on-one time with anyone long enough you will lighten up to them, but to change your whole philosophy? Even Norton's reason for his prison stay - gangbangers don't go after revenge anymore? After what happened, they don't even go after the family? Heck, they even knew the address!I think the film may have been much better if the part that was supposed to be tagged on at the end of the film was actually filmed and inserted. ""American History X"" was a decent movie, and the acting was especially good. But it is a very flawed film, too easy, and really doesn't reflect reality as much as so many think it does.",American History X

While in jail he befriends a black man, is raped in the shower and has his life comptly turned around by the time he is realeased. But upon arrival back home he sees that his little brother, played by Edward Furlong is going down that very same path and must save him before it is to late. Norton ignites the screen in his best performance to date. He gives ever line with power and emotion and Furlong is not far behind him. This film also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen. It left me totally speechless.

From the first to the last scene I was just amazed at how unnatural the scenario unfolded and how jaw-droppingly convenient every plot turn was laid out the viewer to mercifully accept. I just don't understand what people find entertaining about this sort of movie. The social commentary was laughable and at best lacking, the score obnoxiously present and far too much actors overacted to the point of it being a parody.All it takes is one preachy racist lecture from dad at the breakfast table to make a seemingly intelligent young man a skinhead...what? Even the average daytime soap creates a better backdrop than this. Blacks simply giving up their turf over a lost game of hoops? On what true story on what planet was this movie based again? *Ugh*This movie could have been made by Ikea; during construction everything is completely spelled out for you, but that which should be holding it together is randomly missing.3.5 / 10",American History X
187,harrylosborne,"Nazism from a new angle, but too reliant on its lead performance",7,7 June 2019,"Highly regarded and seen as one of Edward Norton's most prominent roles to date, American History X is a dark retelling of racial tensions and Nazism in modern America, highlighting the unending vicious circle of conflict. Personally, Norton is leant heavily on to bring this film to life: the concept is without a doubt interesting, but doesn't go deep enough to really highlight the beliefs and thoughts of those so opposed to other belief systems and races.The story is self-explanatory enough: following a stint in prison, Derek Vinyard (Norton) tries to distance himself from his Nazi past, before realising his younger brother Danny (capably played by Edward Furlong) is already deeply integrated. Flashbacks of Vinyard's past (all shown in black and white) detail parts of his family's history, explaining his journey from one of the most hardened affiliates of the party to a far more self-aware character. Throughout the film he tries his best not to let Danny get sucked in further, but every action has an equally damaging consequence.Infamous for one scene in particular (a failed carjacking upon which a lack portion of the film is based), American History X actually isn't as revolutionary as it has been considered to be. No doubt interesting and somewhat thought provoking, some of the scenes seem gratuitous (both in violence and story-fleshing), fairing to really elevate the film. Norton himself is the gem, but without his stellar outing, it's hard to believe that this controversial film would truly be remembered today.",American History X

The addition of a star to NORTON, however, was too much for the actor's acting alone to sustain such a heavy and grand theme.",American History X
189,brianberta,One of the most powerful films ever,8,3 February 2015,This is probably one of the deepest films made in years. Edward Norton made an incredible lead performance that drives the movie well. This film can be hard to watch at times and it may not be for everyone with its intense action and violence but the overall message of the movie is well thought out and is quite moving. Even the most violent of people can change as seen by Derek when he becomes friends with a black man when he was in prison. Behind all the violence lies a great message that is pretty motivational. Its plot details how black and white people despise each other and often get in fights and even kill each other. The movie details how brothers Derek and Danny both try to turn themselves around from their harsh life. All of their friends are racist and both of them fear their friends turning on them if they try to leave their gang. The ending is tragic and it's hard to watch. It gets me every time but it's fitting. This is a really amazing film. It has a great story and a great message. All of this combines to make one of the best movies in the 90's. As long as you can get by the gore and action then this will likely be a film for you. This is a must see film for all fans of drama movies.,American History X

While some of the elements were a bit too abrupt, the film did not dispense easy answers to tough questions, nor did it sentimentalize or offer a pasted-on happy ending.  Very few current movies are so thought provoking.I think that the comments by Tony Kaye were due more to injured pride than injured film.

History X tells us how impressionable our children are in the new millennium and let's face for the past forty and fifty years since the arrival of the Sixties and Rock N Roll but there is also a side to the movie which is giving it's audience food for thought and making you realize what is really important and that's to believe in what you believe not in what you are told to believe. It's like that in schools, countries and even prisons where you are told what to believe, what to think and what to feel (Famous words of Tony Montana) and it makes you realize that you have to be a free spirit to get along in this world.

Only almost embarrassed, because the right wing antics of Ed Norton's main protagonist would probably have made Hitler blush. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a Neo-Nazi of the Uber variety. This guy really hates black people. The very presence of a black person makes his skin crawl. He rants and raves, sounding wonderfully maniacal, about the blight that is black America, angering and upsetting his family - even though it was his own father that instilled these ideas initially. All, that is, except his younger brother, who looks up to him, admires him, and devours every word of vile rhetoric. One night, Derek carries out an act of ghastly violence against a black criminal - this scene has to be seen to be believed - and winds up in jail. There, his life, his attitudes and his thoughts about the path his younger brother are on are brought into sharp focus. Disturbing, unrelenting, unflinching and as harrowing a movie as you are ever likely to see. Black, white, yellow or an odd shade of mauve, everyone MUST watch this movie.

194,mr_popcorn,American History X,9,30 October 2008,"""His father taught him to hate. His friends taught him rage. His enemies gave him hope."" Tony Kaye made his feature directorial debut with this dramatic exploration into the roots of race hatred in America. In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Danny's account of Derek's life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek. Director Tony Kaye, with a background in TV commercials and music videos, filmed in L.A. beach communities. Rated R ""for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality and nudity.""American History X is a powerful statement to modern society. Racism have always been a sensitive subject to tackle and not since Schindler's List have we seen this powerful of a film be presented with such potency. Edward Norton shines in his role as Neo-Nazi white supremacist skin-head Derek Vinyard. He was able to adapt to his character both physically and emotionally. Playing as his brother Danny, Edward Furlong sizes up to Norton's intensity and was able to spar acting wits with him.The touch of black & white was a nice addition as well. Director Tony Kaye gave the film a grim look and his eye for visual style was impressive as well. The ending is cringe-worthy.

I love the way this movie was made, because it solely focused on showing what lead to Derek killing two people, not just showing how he and his neo-nazi crew demolishes stores and assaults black people.Derek was a normal teenager, but it only took a few minutes worth of lecturing from his father to change his life. He took his father as a role model and became a neo-nazi fanatic, falling into his ignorance and leading others to the same. When Derek's father got killed, his rage towards other races escalated even more, making him angrier than ever. Danny looked up to his older brother and ended up trying to copy him. However, just for a brief moment before Danny got killed Derek managed to change Danny's opinion on life. Just shows how easy it is to influence a life of a person close to you and change for the better.Derek realized, that it doesn't matter what is your skin colour, you can still get along, and freed himself from the ignorance he was living in. He stopped looking at stereotypes and judging everybody before getting to know them, some people really would need to wake up and realize this in order to make a better world.Edward Norton showed everyone once again - he can play a variety of roles, he looked just awesome at the first half of the movie, when he was a neo-nazi fanatic, could not have imagined he that badass look to him.

199,PCT1970,"""People Look At Me And See My Brother"", A History Lesson",9,10 May 2019,"Kaye helms one of the best films exploring racism in recent memory. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, settings, cinematography, score and acting. The entire cast delivers exceptional performances. In particular Norton, Furlong, Brooks, Falk and Keach are superb. Norton commands the silver screen and his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. The plot revolves around a neo-Nazi, Derek and his younger brother, Danny. Danny is assigned the task of writing a paper on his beliefs by his school's guidance counselor, Dr. Sweeney after submitting a book report on, ""Mein Kampf"". Dr. Sweeney is the former teacher of Danny's brother Derek. As Danny sits at his computer to start the paper the story of his family's history begins. We find his brother Derek is a very intelligent neo-Nazi who spreads his hatred, propaganda and recruits for the local chapter leader Cameron. Derek is doing time for committing a heinous act of vengeance after his dead father's truck is stolen. During his time in jail Derek is subjected to a brutal assault and is visited by his former teacher. This experience opens his eyes as to why he embraced the neo-Nazis after a life growing up in an environment of violence, hate and racism. Upon his release Derek's mission is to save his family and change his brother's path while struggling with old associates and his own past. This leads to a confrontation with Cameron and a equally eye opening story he tells Danny. The plot is intense, violent, thought provoking, insightful, heartwrenching, disturbing and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes and not just quotes, but speeches in this film. After his reunion with his brother, Danny's report starts off as, ""People look at me and see my brother"". If only that was not the case, but sometimes it takes tragic events to see things differently, change one's beliefs, end the violence and alter one's future. This remains one of the very best modern day films probing racism and violence. It is a sublime and brilliant work of art in it's genre.",American History X
200,lagriff05,Overrated and incomplete,8,8 December 2007,"Well, this is a bit of a letdown, but then again, I went into it with a critical mind anyway, so it's not such a surprise. This is the much lauded American History X, and it is in fact a great movie, and I do mean truly *great*, instead of just *good* or whatever other adjective you might stick in there. What is ""great,"" then? American History X boasts a sleek, crystal clear filming job and top-notch, through the roof acting, and it's obvious that this one wasn't let out of the gate until everything was just picture perfect all around. Yet, at the same time, this is not always good, with a few blemishes adorning its polished-to-perfection exterior. Yes, this is surely a giant of a film, but it does tend to stumble over its own feet a bit. Just a bit.Not modest or afraid at all, American History X is chock full of lengthly, rather rotund exhibits of preaching - and it is even mentioned once in the film - which is not a bad thing in itself. I hear lots of people crowing about how that's what's wrong with this movie, but no, it isn't. I don't mind it at all, and it mostly just serves as food for thought and a way of carrying the story along. But yes, there it is - this preaching, as it is so dubbed, carries the story far too much, overwhelming the movie like a blanket. The problem with this movie is that it's incomplete. Come on, are we really supposed to believe that all of this - the party, the talk, the flashbacks, the death - happened in one night? Are we honestly expected to believe that this white supremacist teenager changed his outlook in life in one single night while writing an essay? The ending, too...while touching, it left me feeling cold overall. Nothing here was elaborated upon properly - we didn't see near enough of Derek's transformation to a new man in prison; just the bare minimum of it. There were less than 3 scenes with this Cameron character, who had been built up as quite important, and the whole party speeds by like a blur to the point where you wonder what just hit you. Give us more, dammit, this barely scrapes the surface of the potential this movie had. It tries to fool us by throwing in a lot of preaching and whatnot, but that won't fool me.Regardless, I did enjoy this quite a bit. American History X grabbed me by the throat and went full-throttle for damn near two hours. The characters are believable, and the plot is thick and quite juicy. It's a thoughtful, pensive film that will force you to really sink your teeth in and think; this isn't a summer blockbuster or a popcorn flick of any kind. For fans of intelligent, creative, introspective films, this is a winner, but be warned, it is not as good as people say. A rather tragic complex; a great film that just doesn't live up to expectations. The potential is there, though, and all in all this is an enjoyable film, so go get it if this sounds like your thing.",American History X

Unforgetful performance by Edward Norton(Derek).I think this is his best performance up to date.He has proved how dedicated he is to his acting & truly this role deserved an Oscar. Edward Furlong(Doris) also plays a fantastic role.Lending deep emotions in to the role.This movie will make you feel that in the past if you have wasted your years for no good reasons then please don't waste it now.Becasuse Hate is Baggage.Love can overcome all odds.Some scenes in the movie will make you feel why you don't get along with your brother that well.Hopefully you can learn and see for yourself. Specially the scene in which Derek takes a bath & the movie takes you back to his childhood days playing side by side with your brother.This will cut you deep.You will feel the pain. The ending is very good & unpredictable.Soundtrack is fabulous.Will make you feel why you wasted so many good years of your life. Truly a masterpiece!!!Best movie of the 1990's.,American History X
202,allyjack,"Wildly variable quality, but fascinating and gripping",7,1 September 1999,"Suggests the devil has the best tunes: the portrayal of Norton's immersion in the movement is scintillating, conveying both the visceral excitement and his fearsome articulacy and the sexy physicality it gives him - the scene where the dinner-table discussion of Rodney King grows into a brutal attack on Gould is painful to watch. At such times the sleek, visually punchy style draws you right in and is all the more mesmerizing for the repulsive nature of the identification.  But the movie has way more problems with the other side of the argument. The prison scenes are reasonable enough, if too reliant on a single amiable black guy as a positive influence on Norton, but Furlong's personal journey makes far less sense - the performance is blank and he doesn't have half the space to explain or demonstrate himself. The closing stretches are messy and disappointing. The social fabric of racism is barely touched on (easily the worst scene is the clunky flashback to the racist dad) and the movie's ""anti"" argument consists mainly of assertions about  racists being sad, time-wasting assholes. Despite this wildly variable quality, it was one of the more fascinating and gripping movies of its year.",American History X

204,sandnair87,American History X is A Harrowing Morality Tale!,10,27 April 2015,"Make no mistake; American History X is not pretty. It's not fun. It made me squirm and cringe. Not because it was bad, but because it's powerful stuff - a refreshing change from the usual saccharine attempts by Hollywood to address racism, giving us a brilliant tale told without restraint or bias.The movie begins on the day former leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) gets out of prison after serving a 3- year sentence for the vicious manslaughter of black thieves who were trying to steal his truck. The incident in question was the culmination of Derek's indoctrination as a white supremacist, begun in the lessons of his father who was slain at the hands of black men, and picked up by Venice Beach's white-power kingpin Cameron. Derek's high-flying stardom within the latter's organization crashes in prison, where Derek slowly learns the error of his ways and builds a resolve to keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. He comes home to find that his brother has succumbed to the rancorous influence of the same hate- group who turned him into a skinhead thug.Meanwhile, at school, Danny must rewrite a paper for his history class because the glowing essay he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was rejected. He is ordered by his high school principal Dr. Sweeney to instead write a report on his brother and his own journey into the twisted skinhead world titled 'American History X'. Derek is the star of Danny's account, and Derek's transformation is revealed in black and white flashbacks when he recounts to Danny about his prison ordeal - his disillusionment with other skinhead inmates, their revenge on him and his unexpected friendship with a black convict. Danny slowly comes to realize the truth - the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates nothing but misery. In the end, though, there is no escaping the price for Derek's sins. American History X is deceptively simple in its story telling, but first-time director Tony Kaye directs it like an auteur, giving us a harrowing morality tale that is both rich and gripping at all times. But it is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real. He plays the raging neo-Nazi with unsettling conviction, spitting hateful propaganda and brutally letting his feelings out. Edward Furlong's performance as Danny shows an impressive range for a young actor, making Danny a believable teenager.When Edward Norton's brilliant, fully rounded performance rubs up against the film's grainy toughness - complimented by an impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay - American History X becomes an exhilarating experience.",American History X
205,mohit_sinsniwal,This is a fantastic movie...,10,26 May 2019,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film.",American History X

As the back cover of the DVD mentions and in many cases it's right, American History X does know how to push every raw never to it's very core. I was surprised as that throughout watching this film, I was able to analyze everything I had saw.The film digs deep into the story about a man, his bro, his family and all other people who are racial and very brutal towards are cultures. The man does a runner, killing two and spent some hard time for three years owning up for it. After the grueling period, he is released but is told and maybe convinced that his brother is going down the same track he did. Aware of his brother's unawareness of the danger that is up ahead, this man tries to prevent it.Edward Norton does a very good job at playing his role of Derek Vineyard who was a very brutal, raw and sadistic being who naturally became an honest but still unstable character. His performance was very believable and Edward Furlong as the bro Danny was a good choice for a back up and he was an emotional being. The rest of the cast did very well and I enjoyed each and every one of their performances.I believe the story was quite an impacting one because throughout we're feeling what these characters are going through. It's almost one of the saddest films I've seen recently since ""Angela's Ashes"".The use of black and white cinematography to create the flash backs and the cinematography full of color for the current moments was done very smartly, watching it the first time it almost caught me off saying, ""what's going on here?"". Overall I loved that use of filming techniques, gave it something powerful to look forward to.I think this is one of the only late 90's films which is able to stand up and rank as one of the best of it's kind, in that particular year. 9.5/10",American History X
208,Nightmarelogic,Almost brilliant movie.,7,6 December 2019,This is one of the those movies that is brilliant until the last five minutes. Except if you watch the movie you can actually see it coming but you still hate it. This is the story about two brother. Derek and Danny. The story is being told in large part through flashback as Danny is telling the story about Derek and how he landed in prison for killing to black gang members who were trying to steal his car. The beginning of the movie starts with Danny breaking up a fight with another young gang member who was bullying a white kid. Who happens to shoot him in the last few minutes of the movie. That's the part of the movie that annoys. The circle of violence. It wouldn't be so bad but by this point Derek and Danny have both decided to give up the gang life and hate in general so it makes no sense to kill of Danny.

209,extravaluejotter,"Nasty, Unsettling, Possibly a Classic...",7,14 June 2007,"""American History X"" is a pretty conventional film. The plot could be summed up as ""Good boy gets led down the wrong road, realises the error of his ways and tries to distance himself from his misdeeds."" Hollywood has done this sort of thing hundreds of times before but there's something about ""AHX"" that gripped me from start to finish. I thought that I knew how the movie would end, but I didn't. There was just enough exposition about race hate to make me question my own prejudices. There were some powerhouse performances, particularly Edward Norton's.""AHX"" isn't a perfect film by any means. Some scenes (like the one establishing Derek's father's racist credentials) don't work because their messages are too obvious. The pathos of the final scenes are diluted somewhat by a flagrant disregard for police procedure, which almost pushes the film into melodrama territory.I wonder what the film would have been like if director Tony Kaye had been allowed to complete his edition of it. As it stands, it's a thought-provoking and mostly uncompromised glimpse of the racial tension that simmers in every mixed-race culture. Perhaps Kaye WAS taking too long to finish off a simple story, but perhaps the message that he wanted to convey would have been more powerful if the studio suits hadn't rushed him..?",American History X

Eventually when they try and shift through the gears although the messages stick and generalisation the film unfortunately doesn't. The film is now outdated and has this have been made now would have been immediately pulled off yet that's what I liked it was brave and real. The best statement was actually from Monica Gellar's Dad when he said you don't even know the world your children are living in. Now the message here wasn't just for Edward Norton but to all parents as a wake up call. The problem is parents fail or failed and this is passed on to generations. At the same time the system fails its people, now society is over run with different groups, not in terms of nationalities but everything. People have too much to say, things have become silly and so riots protests etc. At the end of the day people don't hate skin or people, they hate behaviours. It's these behaviours that forces these messages to go round in circles. Hard to know what's good and what's not. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground, people don't want to bite their tongues anymore. Now, that doesn't mean that is right or wrong. But look at the film from the school assignment and the music to the shaved heads, what's been shown in the language and languages used. Hommie, init, eff this and that, tripping. Whether past present or future the main message is people chose which side they are on or what they believe, sometimes they're easily manipulated but if you step back all it is is behaviours. Parents should be better, communities should be and so should authorities.",American History X

Nothing about this film disappointed me or that I thought was stupid about it. Every element was stunning and amazing. All I can say is, i'm simply speechless.Finally, a film that doesn't follow the typical ""don't be racist"" message. Yes, it has that, but in a completely different way and tone. It's brought out different as well.Story: Edward Norton is a Neo-Nazi civil leader who's anger and mean spirit towards immigrants leads him to murder two African Americans, sentencing him to 3 years in prison. Out in the open 3 years later, a changed Edward decides to change his life, starting by preventing his younger brother, (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path he has.The film is mostly told in a flashback perspective, introducing what causes Edward to visit prison, what inspired his anger, and how prison changes him.Edward Norton's performance is the god of all performances. Not only should he have won the Oscar for best actor, but it shouldn't be the least bit close to any of the others. Unbelievably convincing and inspiring, and flawlessly carries out his role. His performance made this movie. It completely resembled everything this movie stood for. No words can describe how much his performance inspired me. I'm confused on how it's even possible that a performance could be as good as this. He nailed this performance from beginning to end.Edward Furlong excellently transforms from a little trouble making punk to a changed, and well understood boy who learns to appreciate other races.I'm not going to say a thing about the ending. All i'm going to say is that it is a gigantic slap in the face. Regardless, it gets the message around very clear, and manages to stay professional. Although not the ending you may expect, it is still a very nice and perfect conclusion to the film.This is just the brink of what I can say about this film. The performances, the story, and the all around film was just nailed perfectly. The film, from beginning to end, knows what it's doing, and does it...brilliantly. This film is a must to see. See it, because this film impacted my life greatly, and made me look very differently on life. I'm so glad I saw this film. I don't know if i'd see it again, because something as beautifully done as this doesn't come around very often, and I would not want to make it tiring, ever. Maybe one other time years later. All I can simply say is that this film left me speechless, but my mind filled. I thank this movie, and all responsible for it's creation.",American History X

I will not give spoilers, but there were a few times you can tell the plot was a bit contrived to fit the authors narrative. It was as if they were willing to sacrifice a bit of realism for a neater story. I also object to the ending, again I will not reveal what happens, but it felt unnecessary. Kind of like overkill. With some slight reshuffling there could have been a more rewarding ending. What they decided on is shocking, but it doesn't really add. With that out of the way I can talk about the good. Taking a serious look at Neo Nazis is a very bold move. The overall message is still that racism is bad, which is hardly original in itself, but I still like how they did it. Instead of making the Nazis ridiculous cartoon villains, they actually gave them a credible perspective. Not that you have to agree with their views, but you can at least see why the characters think the way they do. Actually, if anything some of the liberal characters are at times more cartoonish. Then again that might just be because it is so much more common for liberal political opinions to be in Hollywood movies, so they inevitably seem more cliche. The cast all do a great job, Edward Norton deserves recognition for this, he was able to bring a very complex character to life, and explore some very dark themes. I know this movie was made well before Breaking Bad, but it does remind me of Walter White, in the sense that you may not agree with everything he does, but you cannot stop watching to see what happens next. Overall, this is a very heavy film, you need to be in the right mood for it, but if you are, it is very rewarding. This is a great movie.",American History X

In the Cilton years prison racialitst reform was filling prisons with minor offenders of wrong colour, while affirmative action was turning hard working Amuricans into hatte filled monstuers . A growing, ambitious guy of high IQ and later questionable tattoos has an inspiring black teacher that sells his woke agenda, while his policemen racialist father is against it. Black violentia kills the dad and a foster father figure is found in local corrupt republican-leaning manipulator. This causes guy to shave his head and when a gang of melanin rich drifters try to rob his car after losing control of the basketball court due to movie hero being an awesome, if melanin challenged, athlete, he stands his ground and uses some excess force to whack a couple of them here and there. For that he gets some prison sentence but whilst in jail he befriends a dark skinned comedian and rejects his ideology of republican nativism, all while getting some stitches for snitches and books from his ideologically possessed O-bama wannabe former teacher. After being brain-washed he gets out of prison to try to imprint some liberal woke bs into his impressionable younger brother. But, alas, as left wing indoctrination portrayed as sincere repentance for white privilege of being an orphan whose daddy policemen (also white privilege) had a privilege of being shot on duty by some gang members with excess access to drugs and melanin after protesting incompetence of his co-workers that got jobs via affirmative action, was beginning to work, there is a new problem. The violentia wins again as a bullet is shot again from a minority member into his brother, killing him on spot. So, violentia wins the day, and the circle continues, since no matter how many republicans repent for their white privilege, problem is not solved, since the root of the problem is was on the other side all along.

Transforming himself in the intelligent skinhead Derek Vineyard is a textbook example of great acting. His co-stars, even Eddie Furlong, combine to make this movie a great one. The message of the movie is not subtle but hits you right in the face with reality. People hate, and that hate can be turned around to hurt you in the worst way. This film doesn't lag for a second and every frame is loaded with meaning and emotion. This isn't a movie for the faint hearted and if you don't like what you are watching then it will be even harder for you to digest the fact that there are people out there just like every character in the movie. I think that everyone is racist to some degree and this movie has you both agreeing with what Derek has to say but at the same time thinking that you're not in the same boat as he is. You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga.

It is raw, in your face, unapologetic and as real as it gets. The main message of the movie is about mistakes and about history repeating itself.

219,shaun98,terrific (major spoilers),8,12 April 2002,"One overriding them of ""American History X"" is that redemption is possible for even the worst if us. When we see Derek Vinyard as a skinhead, he seems like the most despicable type of human being, as he blames people of color for all our societal ills. His statements are so hateful and incendiary, I suspect even some racists would regard them as too extreme. He is taken under the wing of Cameron Alexander, a notorious distributor of hate literature. He is prone to fits of violent anger. As a matter of fact, even he admits his own lack of self control. All this anger, hatred, and rage explodes during that one fateful night, when he murders a black man for breaking into his car. At that point it seems he is among the damned.However, prison life forces him to change his outlook. He is no longer in control of the situation. He is at the mercy of vengeful, unstable fellow inmates. One of the most chilling scenes in the film is when he is gang-raped in the shower. During that scene we are presented with the unthinkable: the viewer actually feels sorry for the character and wishes him to find a way out of his situation. Thankfully, he has a chance to do so, and is horrified to see his younger brother follow in his footsteps.In some scenes we see him working in the laundry room with a black inmate. He finds himself opening up to him, even making small talk about sports. By the time he his released, so complete is his change that he seems like a new person. For all intents and purposes that does seem to be the case. Edward Norton's performance makes the film completely believable.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by New Line Cinema",American History X
220,Kubris,One of the best films I've ever seen.,10,26 June 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 38AHX is, in my young eyes, one of the best films ever created. A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone: hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.The most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...But almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.Only Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though: he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.The music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come: an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.And it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch. You will feel emotions watching this: not sadness, but that might happen, but shame. That snide joke you made to your buddies behind that person's back, that prejudice you thought in your head, well American History X will remind you of that. The plot is well crafted and well told, the flashbacks are placed perfectly, and the pacing keeps things constantly interesting. If you can stomach the infamous scenes and the ample, but necessary language, American History X might just change you as a person for the better. 9.8/10",American History X
221,lucasversantvoort,"Good character drama, lackluster social study",7,5 May 2015,"I remember watching this film in school when I was about 15 or so. Needless to say, it was an impactful experience. American History X is without a doubt an emotionally charged experience, but the way it's all handled is also ironically where I feel things go a bit wrong.It's nighttime. Danny (Edward Furlong) is trying to sleep, but his older brother Derek (Edward Norton) having loud sex with his girlfriend is keeping him up. Suddenly, he notices a few black men trying to steal Derek's car. He alerts Derek who, armed with nothing but his boxers and a handgun, kills one of the men, shoots another one and tries to shoot at the remaining one driving away, but to no avail. Danny, seeing what his brother wrought, looks at Derek while he walks angrily toward the black man he wounded earlier. The film then cuts to the present, shot in color (as opposed to the B/W flashbacks), as Danny meets with the principal due to him writing a paper on Hitler's Mein Kampf. The principal (Avery Brooks), who also used to be Derek's teacher, tries to explain to Danny that it's Derek, now serving a prison sentence, who made him this way, but he doesn't get through to him. Instead, he gives him a new assignment: to write a paper on his brother. The film then crosscuts between flashbacks to how Derek became a neo-Nazi skinhead, how he got incarcerated, etc. and the present, showing Danny and Derek, who has changed his ways while in prison, trying to make it in their day-to-day lives.It's to director Tony Kaye's credit that the film is the emotional journey it is. He makes extensive use of dramatic orchestral and choral music (courtesy of Anne Dudley), slow-motion and black-and-white photography to enhance the drama and he mostly succeeds. Also great are Norton and Furlong's performances who not only excel in their individual scenes, but exhibit a chemistry in their scenes together, a sense that these are indeed two brothers who've lived together.I do have a few issues with the film however. It has an unhealthy tendency to give a lot of screen time to neo-Nazi ideology. We of course know that the filmmakers are not proponents of this ideology through the existence of characters like the benevolent principal Sweeney, the black inmate Lamont and the evil skinhead leader Cameron, the subplot of how Derek became a neo-Nazi (he was fueled more by anger than ideology and was subsequently easily manipulated by Cameron), the fact that principal Sweeney came to visit Derek in prison after Derek was raped by skinheads because he befriended Lamont and tells him that he cannot run away, thus ensuring the safety of his family, but that he has to stay with them and try to make amends. Make no mistake, the film doesn't in any way portray neo-Nazis as good, but the incessant focus on discussions with Derek spouting racist ideology are strange in that you realize the film actually seems to spend more time there than providing a balanced view and social context. I know it's an unfair comparison, but remember The Wire? That series spent countless hours (which a film doesn't have obviously) explaining the complex cyclical relationship between the police and criminals. It gave insight into the hopeless prospects of many poor blacks and showed how sometimes joining a gang is the only viable option. Despite the fact that American History X isn't fundamentally racist, it doesn't give us enough social context to get rid of that nagging feeling that things could've been more balanced.Also relevant is that apparently the film's ending is an alternate one. Instead of hearing the dead Danny quote Lincoln's 1861 Inaugural Address, we would see Derek unable to deal with Danny's death and shaving his head, thus becoming a skinhead again. This would then tie the whole plot together and show how the film's really about 'the endless cycle of violence'. But, at least according to IMDb's trivia page, this was altered after Norton objected. I can see why as that would've been an even more hopeless ending, but I wonder if the original ending wouldn't have been better. As it is, we see Derek and Danny truly bonding after which Danny is shot by the same black boy he insulted earlier. The film thus ends with blacks being the aggressors which results in the white characters we've come to know and understand either being dead or emotionally traumatized. We can't really look at it from the boy's point of view either, because the film doesn't grant us context about his way of life, save for a shocked close-up of his face as he realizes what he's done. Again, like the film's excessive focus on racist ideology, this ending leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, despite Danny's quote about how 'hate is baggage', etc. At least Derek going skinhead again would have softened the racist angle and strengthened the 'cycle of violence' point of view.All in all, it's hard to summarize my feelings toward American History X. I appreciate all the potent melodrama director Kaye and screenwriter McKenna create, I like Derek's character development, principal Sweeney, Lamont, etc., but I can't help but feel the film should have provided a more balanced social context à la The Wire.",American History X
222,FeverDog,"Terrific at first, but something's not right... (SPOILER)",7,6 August 2000,"I finally saw this again on cable this week.  When I first saw this in theatres, I of course was totally blown away. It was stunningly acted, beautifully shot, and, for the subject matter, very restrained, objective, and nonexploitive (the score was a little overbearing, though).  All these aspects remain in my second viewing, but the ending seems to negate everything that precedes it.  Throughout the film the story is Derek's hatred and his subsequent enlightenment and how Daniel is headed down the same destructive path.  We're led to believe that Daniel, by being made to write about his brother, will realize the error of his ways and change his outlook while he's still young and impressionable to do so.
So if this is the point of the story, why do the filmmakers have Daniel murdered in his high school bathroom by some kid that got in his face? Obviously, since he's dead, everything that he just learned the night before means absolutely nothing.  Are the filmmakers saying that it was already too late to help Daniel?  Why give more pain to Derek and his family in Daniel's brutal, practically random slaying?  Derek's already learned what he needed to.  Or did the filmmakers just want one more final shocker to tidy up the movie. Why not have him live, and the audience walk out hoping, praying, that he becomes a better man? (Same problem in American Beauty.)
(And what are the odds that a high school bathroom would be completely empty right before class starts? Just wonderin'...)I am in no way trashing this film. We can add another 90's Oscar theft to the list [Morgan Freeman, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Martin Scorsese, PT Anderson (I could go on), and now Mr. Norton].

PS- I could have done without the prison rape scene, and could have seen some more of Fairuka Balk sex scenes would have been nice!
Leftists always give you the same ad-hominem attacks... ""These are people who think that time has passed them by..."", or, ""Racists do what they do because they are insecure""... bla bla bla!
I love the scene at the dinner table, where the guy who's the Jew dating the lead's mother says, ""these are people that feel alienated by the system""....
Oh please, spare me!! The only thing that matters in this world, that matters to God, is the actions that you take!! Your own internal dialogue, as this character seems to be suggesting, is something that dominates our personality in the end, and there is no free will. But since not everyone acts on those impulses, the results of our actions are the only tangible things others can see!!
That being said, this movie is entirely believable, and the main character completely justified. This film seems to take the left-wing, communist path of ""destroy the individual, by attacking his motivations and not his actions.""
Communist liberals don't really care that there are dead bodies in the streets... they care about tearing down the concept of right and wrong... Case in point? Derek, the main character, becoming overly violent on the night in question that landed him in jail on murder charges. Ask yourself: would Derek have been a hero if he had simply shot the guy who broke into his truck, to leftists? No, he would not have been!! He would have been a hero if he had left the guy go and steal his truck. Why? Because, leftist communists are hypocrites, and believe in ""one standard for those who help bring about the divide, and another for those who call for the same standards of behavior for all."" Communists can only come to power when society is divided. Then, they sneak in and steal the country while people are looking to fight each other, and not them!! Hence, the real racists are on the left!!! What does all this mean? It means, you cannot put a guy like Derek through the loss of his father, constant harassment in life, and expect him to react as a pacifist. As it is, the film only serves, in my humble opinion, to further the divide. The real statement of this movie is: There is one standard of behavior for blacks and other minorities, and an entirely other standard for whites (which is to say: bend over and take it because we have had it too good for too long!)>>.....",American History X

Another problem I have with it is that it blames the Vinyard family (ie Ed Norton, Ed Furlong, and company) for all the problems in the movie, as if some invisible ether on their souls is invisibly causing all these social problems that they face!
Not one single white person in the movie committed a major crime- that would be all the black characters in the movie! And yet, being a mildly bad Nazi in a gang formed out of necessity, oh! Why that is bordering on unforgiveable!
How about some logic applied to these academic eggheads?? Maybe next time, make a movie about white people who live on their own, where they don't have to face the challenges of a multi-racial hell hole like Los Angeles!!

The first one simply points out the racist drawings about the Black and white people in America and the second one recalls us that the Black & white period were people who seem to be colorless. American History X is none other than that. The subject is so strong and it has its world appeal. It looks familiar not only in America but also in the entire world. Racism and important topic which was talked, discussed and rectified (up to a mark) all-time ago but it has its significance in these times also. We are unable to eradicate it. And that core element swings through each and everyone which indirectly points to secularism and the shut down of secularist vision. Racism has strong roots nowadays also. When it comes to the film, mainly it revolves around the character of Norton, his subjective consequences, and his mind stage from wrong to right and his relieving part.

What makes his performance special is his laser-like intensity brought to all things skinhead, at least for the pre-prison part of the movie. The movie starts to unravel during Norton's transitional phase to someone more sensitive and socialized. That transition isn't given enough context and his prison ""friendship"" isn't sufficient to believe he's a changed man. It's all too convenient a plot crutch. Norton's asked to make this shape-shifting believable, but the screenplay lets him down. Nevertheless, Norton's excellent performance deserves to be watched regardless of plot quibbles. N.B.

It could have been a great movie but there were one major flaw that made the movie just a better-than-average movie.My main issue with the film involves Norton's younger brother. It did not help that Edward Furlong gave a very poor performance. Perhaps because he was not on the same acting level as Norton, Furlong was unconvincing. Sadly, I really did not care about the fate of Furlong's character. If there was a better actor in that role, it might have changed my feelings about the movie.I certainly understand why American History X has an effect on many moviegoers.

And it is always nice to see that there are also films dealing with problems from the here and now, namely discrimination and racism.
but the question is always how good is the movie
but such films always seem to excite me as an excuse or excuse and not to torture white minorities in front of the camera.So I just went a few scenes too long, I found a few of the dialogues are completely pulled on the ass hair because skinheads are so bald. But I have to applaud the movie because it's the first movie of my life that actually showed racism in a realistic way.Of course, there are other films about racism but people are just ugly ass bones screaming. As someone who belongs to a minority, we noticed in parallel and this was perfectly captured in the film because the problem of most racists here is that they believe they are right because they are convinced that they have to help others and with their actions You achieve that.
Of course I could still talk all the key scenes everywhere, the famous scenes like the conversations, the basketball scene or, of course, the curb scene the distance is more famous than the movie itself but I focus on the important.

When he is released from jail he tries to get away from his old life and help his brother, played by Edward Furlong, to understand what happened to him. The film covers racism from nearly every angle and really makes you think. The narrative structure is a bit twisted though, and a lot of it is just flashbacks explaining how Derek came to be a skinhead, what happened to him in jail, etc. It's interesting to see how his hatred tears apart his family and hurts those around him.

Ed Norton is way over the top, and hardly worthy of award consideration for his performance.  In fact the best work (as usual) is by veterans Stacey Keach and Beverly D'Angelo.  The best scene in the film is the usual prison shower rape, which is very funny, especially Norton's reaction to it.  In fact this whole film is more inadvertantly campy than I expected.  I can't believe anyone thought it 'dramatic' or 'powerful'. See 'Into the Fatherland'.  A much better movie on the subject matter.",American History X
232,Don-102,A Powerful History Lesson For Us ALL !!!,9,13 April 1999,"The third best film of 1998 is a tenacious, overwhelming depiction of hate for no reason and stupidity that is learned.  Everybody should see this picture, no matter how old, or what color, race, or creed.  AMERICAN HISTORY X is not profound, is not symbolic, and does not have a hero who lets us know at the end that this is all wrong.  In fact, Ed Norton is quite the anti-hero, even after release from prison.  You see he killed two African-Americans who were robbing his car on his own property.  It was certainly NOT self-defense.AMERICAN HISTORY X is a message movie, no doubt about it.  But the message is not told in words or speeches by the actors.  Experiences tell the story of some very small-minded people who believe they have the temerity to ""rid"" a portion of California of ""unwanted, inferior races.""  A racial basketball game punches what the opening sequence pulled off right home.  Norton is a 'lieutenant' in the D.O.C., a neo-Nazi organization.  He is the leader while a sinister Stacey Keach recruits and brainwashes from a headquarters somewhere in the city (Venice Beach, CA).  If the whites win, the blacks must leave the court, forever.  I can only imagine the cheers or jeers this scene brought about in audiences who saw the picture during its brief theater run.  In fact, it was probably in the public's best interest not to keep it out too long.  This is sad, but a point is presented here.  Smart, open-minded people will see the senselessness of it all and see racism for what it is: sheer stupidity and ignorance.The film is presented in an interesting narrative method, with flashbacks in black and white before Norton's incarceration.  After his release, we see in living, breathing color the scary gangland that is the racial atmosphere in this section of Cali.  The tragedy of it all is Norton's little brother, played by Edward Furlong (TERMINATOR II), who is clearly headed down the same swasticized path Norton went down.  In prison, Norton's status in the neo-Nazi underworld was heightened to God-like and Furlong, young and impressionable, looks to carry the torch.  Throughout, we see scenes of demeaning race relations and brutal dialogue and ideas put forth blatantly by the skinheads.  Ed Norton, one of the best actors of his generation, bulked up considerably to look the part of the sick skinhead, but after some waking up in jail, he has had enough.Rumors spread rampantly that Norton and director Tony Kaye fought while filming and that a disagreement ensued.  Whoever's ""vision"" won out is the correct one, because this film never steps wrong.  It may be headed down a predictable path, but there are multiple ways this picture could end.  Doom and tragedy are in the air and you just know someone is going to die for no other reason than learned racism and philosophy on different creeds.  It's a shame that the ideas come from someone who should've been the most responsible person in these kid's lives.  He was incapable of shielding them from these idiotic thoughts of single-minded bigotry.  Catholics, Jews, Prodestines, African-Americans, and most importantly, skinhead Nazis should see this important work of art and think about the shame of it all.RATING: 10 of 10",American History X
233,Ladiloque,Seeming or being right. Trauma example,8,31 May 2013,"There's no photography or editing in this film worth a special note. No costumes or dialogues. It's all about the topic. Yeah some scenes are great (hard discussions at lunch with the family will remind you a lot of personal experiences for sure) but overall this film is just an educational chronicle of how efficient communication usually overwhelms and is more convincing than strict sense (and right) reasoning. And so any average kid might be prone to become the nazi monster, the terrorist or the outlaw just since his supposed to be ""authorities"" told him to be so. It might also help you think at your own prejudices. Given this background the film just seem a good high school documentary and it is: but it's also well paced, well acted and passionate.

234,mattrochman,Almost flawless,9,15 June 2006,"This film is a gem and a rather intelligent and poignant story. Extremely gripping and almost has educational value: I would not object to schools showing this to kids in the mid-teens.But I have three complaints (the last two cost it one star).First, Ed Norton being overlooked for the Oscar for his performance in this film simply goes to show you what a ""wank"" the Oscars really is. I'm sure that Roberto Benigni's performance in ""life is beautiful"" would have been terrific, but I'm prepared to hand the Oscar to Norton without even seeing Life is Beautiful for one simple reason: transformation. Acting a character who's personality and eccentricities are constant (eg.. Forrest Gump) is not nearly as difficult as playing a character who starts out as one type of person and transforms gradually to another throughout the film. Norton performs this to a tee and is, to date, the most under-rated actor to grace Hollywood - (did anyone else see his top-notch performance in the People vs Larry Flynt?) Second, there is an unnecessary addition to the story. At the end of the film, Norton walks his brother, Danny, to school and they stop off at a diner. Then the school principle and another guy rolls in and tells Norton that some of his old neo-Nazis mates were beaten up last night and he needs to re-infiltrate the group. Norton was protesting saying that his old ""friends"" are probably looking to do him in. I didn't really understand how this fitted into the story. What exactly were they trying to achieve with this extra piece of story that seemed somewhat out of place or superfluous to the film? All I can think is that they were re-iterating the fact that Norton won't so easily walk away from his old life, but this still seems unnecessary to me.Third, I think the film was just a bit too peachy pie in some respects. From the moment that he starts folding sheets in jail with the likable and funny black guy, you know that somehow these two are going to strike up a friendship and this will play a pivotol roll in helping Norton to ""see the light"" and turn his life around. But the problem is that everything just happened too perfectly. First, he is raped by his neo-nazi friends for dissin' them and playing basketball with black guys. Just didn't seem to be credible in a way, but then again, i've never been in prison and shared a cell with Ben Dover and Bob Downe. Nonetheless, the fact that the neo-nazi's raped him instead of another ""group"" of inmates makes his ultimate rejection of neo-nazi ideology all the more.... ""perfect."" I'm not a neo-nazi advocate by the way. But what about this: after he diss's the neo-Nazis, they no longer protect him and in turn, he is beaten and raped by some random guy. See that is credible! But the writers desperately wanted him to be raped ""by his own"" so that his rejection of them and his transition to being a ""good and accepting"" person is peachy pie perfect.I also found that the shooting of Danny at the end of the film was partly an attempt to ensure that the film doesn't have too much of a peachy pie perfect ending. As a result, I felt like there was something too deliberate about it and come to think of it, I think that the scene in the diner with Norton (as I mentioned above) was probably a distraction, so that we were more surprised by the fact that Danny was shot only a few minutes later. Even if I'm wrong, it seemed a bit too contrived and cost it a star.Otherwise, brilliant film",American History X

Very good and entertaining film, and a very sad one too. 10/10 Masterpiece definitely recommend.",American History X
236,Hawkensian,"Although it is somewhat heavy handed, American History X has great performances and a shocking brutality that leaves a large impression on you.",8,30 September 2014,"The film is carried by Edward Norton, he portrays his character Derek Vinyard with real gusto and vitriol; what a howling, credibility defacing decision it was for Robert Benigni to trump Norton at the Oscars for his vexing role in the saccharine turd that is Life is Beautiful.Vinyard is an intelligent young man from a middle-class suburban home, however he rapidly develops fervent fascist views after his father is murdered by a black gunman. Vinyard has clear leadership skills and he channels them in all the wrong directions. His fierce oration makes him a notable figure in the Californian neo-Nazi movement, bringing him to the attention of veteran racist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), who is well cast as the creepy, manipulative leader. The influence of both Derek and Cameron mean that Derek's younger brother, the rather more placid Danny (Edward Furlong), also harbours dangerous neo-Nazism, although not with the same zeal as his brother.To its merit, the film is unrestrained in its depiction of violent racism. With their foolish understanding of Nazism, the swastika adorned skinheads have a palpable hatred of all things un-Aryan. No one's hatred is greater than Vinyard's, who commits a brutal act of street, or rather curb, justice that has since become infamous. So abhorrent is the scene that it entered my top 10 most painful scenes in cinema history.It's Vinyard's act of violence that lands him in prison, where, perhaps predictably, he has a change of heart. I felt that the manner in which Vinyard changes is rather too pronounced and straight forward, the transformation of such an extreme psychology should have been more nuanced in its depiction – the shift of a psychological complex is one of subtle shades, not clearly defined, narrative friendly episodes.However, I think a good argument can be had about Vinyard's rapid change. Beneath all the extremism is a measured, intelligent man; he isn't an ignorant, retrograde fool, he's a subject one can work with. After all, his realisation isn't completely instantaneous, he integrates with the white thugs of his wing, the Aryan Brotherhood or whatever they call themselves, but their business practices are at odds with his strict principles. Combine this with his repeated and isolated work detail with the black Lamont (Guy Torry) (which I should think is an unlikely scenario for obvious reasons), and his sudden and considerable change of circumstance could have woken him up.There's a whiff of stereotypical characterisation at times; the two principal black characters of the film Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and the aforementioned Lamont are within the realm of the stock character, the latter particularly. They can both be deemed as 'Magical Negroes', a term that refers to black characters whose sole purpose is to serve the development of a white character. Sweeney is Derek's former and Danny's current high school teacher. He is a respected, righteous man with a seemingly infinite wisdom; he manages to disarm everyone with sagacious monologues and philosophical questions that are delivered with his deep, portentous voice. His character is heavily influenced by civil rights figures such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.Lamont, the inmate who Vinyard has repeated laundry duty with, is portrayed by comedian Guy Torry; I haven't seen his stand-up, however his manic, animated performance is certainly reminiscent of a Chris Rock gig. He's a rather frivolous character that's little more than narrative function that services Vinyard's character development.It's not a surprise to find that director Tony Kaye's career began in advertising, his visual flair has transferred to the silver screen and can be seen throughout the film, with repeated use of slow motion and a black and white pallet for flashback scenes. Considering History's subject matter, I felt the film was sometimes stylish to a fault, particularly during a racial territorial dispute on a basketball court that's constructed in a way through aesthetics and music that inclines the viewer to support the white men.Other examples of ill-judgement were during its humorous moments concerning the obesely corpulent and repellent Seth (Ethan Suplee), particularly during a brutal assault on immigrant supermarket staff where he steals a large plastic burger, it's not funny and is inappropriate in its placing.Although its morality tale is heavy handed and simplistic, I must reiterate that American History X is a highly memorable film driven by an incendiary Edward Norton and an unrestrained, vicious intensity that few contemporary films strive for.83% www.hawkensian.com",American History X

238,BB-15,The Underbelly of America,5,11 December 1999,"I was immediately struck by the power of this film, the violent images, the great performance by Edward Norton that just oozes hate. But as the rhetoric of anger and racism built up in the film, I became so uncomfortable I could not continue to watch it. So, this is not a true movie review. I did fast forward to scenes I could handle and the very gruesome ending.This is a very effective portrait of the skin head gang world. The process of how a person can change is also pretty well done considering that 3 years of prison time is compressed to a few scenes. Norton's acting is terrific in showing that transition. Also, the confusion and suffering of the Norton character's family is powerful. Avery Brooks' role is briefly allowed to be a sincere but pretty ineffective counter balance to all of the hate. With the exception of him and another African American in prison, all the African Americans in the film are grim and threatening. And this brings up a huge contradiction in the movie. The African American high school students shown are out of control and no one is really trying to stop them. But, the fact that there are a lot of African Americans in prison is clearly supported in the movie. Meaning, cops do pay attention to them and arrest them. American History X can't have it both ways. To reflect that reality there should have been a lot more police involvement with the young African American gang members. In a way American History X is an example of what it is trying to criticize. It stereotypes most young African Americans as mindless thugs, giving no solution to the gang problem partly justifying the hate that it supposedly is against.",American History X

If you came to see a drama with a powerful story with a deep and powerful message that will leave anyone who watch wet in tears by the end, then you chose the right film.""American History X"" is a drama with a story full of violence and a deep message against society. Everything starts with Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) who after the death of his father by a black man, forms a Nazi-Racist gang called ""skinhead"" and with it the attempt to exterminate and expel all blacks and immigrants in their neighborhood by invading properties and get in conflict with other gangs. One day his house is assaulted by a member of a rival gang, which ends up in a double murder and with the arrest of Derek. 3 years pass and now Derek totally changed, is trying to clear his family name and try to ward off his brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) from the life of crime and racism that himself led into.The film has a very interesting direction by Tony Kaye, filmed in a dramatic and disturbing way. The film is divided into two parts; one in present with Derek coming out of prison and Danny getting closer to the gang; the other part telling Derek's past and how he came from a violent racist to the repentant man haunted by his past. Both parties superbly filmed with shades of different colors. In the present with normal and colorful shot, in the past with black-and-white shots.Not only the direction is superb as well as the writing of David McKenna delivering to the film disturbing and racist dialogs. At first it may seem that the film is in favor of racism and extermination of races. But throughout the film we noticed that they all try to show how stupid and inappropriate is racism and the prejudice that it can bring to those who practice it. All events on file show that more and more, and also the characters that built up the movie, mainly the professor Bob Sweeney (the old professor of Derek and the new from David) and Derek's ""friend"" in prison. Both of them through the movie show to Derek that all of us are equals.But the message to be delivered perfectly it needed superb performances to complete everything and leave everything fantastic. Thanks to both Edwards this is not missed: Furlog proves to be a great dramatic actor, and Norton proves to be one of the best actors of his generation with a FANTASTIC performance that improves with every passing minute.A film with a deep story; superbly written and with a final message that can make the toughest of men shed a tear thanks to fantastic performances and flawless direction.

I just watched it last night on video, and let me tell you it is still with me, and will be for some time to come. Hatred is senseless. This is what I have come away with after seeing this one. What is so sad about American History X, is even though it is a fictional story, it portrays a very realistic problem in our world. It is amazing how one can become so engulfed in hate, that they fail to see how the hatred is destroying them and the people around them. We think that the consequence of Derek's actions is a prison sentence, and the result is a wonderful rehabilitation that is going to change not only his life, but his brother's too, who is headed down the same hate-filled road that Derek was headed down. However, we come to find that life doesn't work that way. Indeed, the hate filled seeds that Derek sowed before prison have blossomed, and the consequences are more then he could have ever imagined. American History X is a great movie because of how painfully real it is, and it doesn't pull any punches. It lets us know just how senseless hatred is...any kind of hate. You see, just because this movie happened to be about white supremacism, doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to everyone. I think the bottom line is this: Any hatred toward anyone can bring you down. It leads to emptiness, and destruction, and can bring about events that will ultimately kill you emotionally, and maybe even literally.",American History X

His past life is told in black and white flashbacks throughout the movie so we get to see the type of person he was before he went into prison. What is ironic about the film is Derek got his brother interested in the neo-Nazi cause and it is up to him now to show his brother there is more to life then mindless hatred.There is a lot of complaints about the acting and the subject matter but I think those people ain't seeing what the film is trying to say.It is a very dark film that doesn't flinch away from the subject matter, the violence is hard to watch at times especially when Derek is raped by his fellow skinheads. What is disturbing most about the film is Derek and Danny are very clever but their minds are getting twisted by hatred that has no direction.I think the acting is not bad. Edward Norton is just mesmerising in the dual roles he has to play in this film. The first being a skinhead, you can see the madness from within him being translated to his eyes. Then as the changed man, his devastation when he see's his dead brother, has me in tears every time. Edward Furlong isn't bad either, although at times, he does come across as wooden. Stacy Keach plays a charismatic leader of the skinheads who twists their minds, even though he doesn't belief half the things he says to them and keeps his own agenda hidden from them so he can keep his control over them. He is also seen as a coward who is quite happy to incite all this hatred but not to take part in it. Avery Brooks who played Captain Sisko in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, plays a professor who sees past the brothers idiotic hatred and wants to turn their focus to something positive.If I have one negative thing to say, it is that I would have liked the film to show what happened to Edward Norton's character after his brother died, whether he went back to his old ways or continued on the more positive path and try to turn the skinheads away from the violence and hatred they embraced.This film just had me from start to finish.",American History X

It steps up to the tough questions and doesn't back down, and it's what helps set 'American History X' apart among the rest. It's an important film, a gritty film, something truly memorable that deserves to be seen, studied, and talked about.Though much of the film is shot in black-and-white, 'American History X' is anything but. It doesn't preach or cater to the audience, it's a frank and honest venture that makes for an extremely difficult but worthwhile sitting. And if there's one reason and one reason only to see this film, see it for Edward Norton's provocative performance. Surely one of the braver roles ever attempted in film, and it's one of the most unforgettable. His magnetic presence exudes power, perfectly conveying the anger and blindness that surrounds him.Unfortunately, 'X' does suffer from sporadic choppiness as it jumps through time to connect the dots and tell a complete, comprehensible story. More than likely, it's a result of Norton's editing overhaul that practically transformed the film from its original idea. However, director Tony Kaye's attempts to distance himself away from the project is a shame.

Mr Norton is truly electrifying as both the nazi-thug and the reformed ex-prisoner, trying to prevent his younger brother to follow in his footsteps (an equally excellent Edward Furlong). True, the violence in this movie is very disturbing, containing a murder scene that is the strongest and nastiest I think I have ever seen. It really made me cringe. But it never becomes gratuitous or just something to titillate the viewer with, but an integral part of the story. And all the time you feel that this story could very well be a true one. Nothing is too blown up, or exaggerated out of proportions. The nazi's party looks just like documentaries I've seen on tv. Heck, I even know some people who underneath their open minded exterior have some views regarding immigrants that are not too far removed from some of the characters in ""American history X"". The visuals are also powerful. Backflashes are black and white, but it doesn't feel superficial. All performances are great with some really outstanding ones: apart from the above mentioned there is Guy Torry as Nortons black buddy in prison and D'Angelo who is convincingly confused about everything happening in her family. If the movie has any faults, it's that the time Norton spends in prison is too sketchy. He is violently raped by some fellow inmates and suddenly (well, almost) he sees the error of his ways?!?!

Edward Furlong is also very good as the little brother on the edge, and Stacy Keach is great as the evil head of the group.Director Tony Kaye tells the story by having Norton's nazi days in black and white flashbacks, and the present day where Norton is freed from prison and his hatred in color. This makes it not only easier to distinguish the past and present scenes, but it somehow makes the scenes more effective.

  After having shot and killed two black people as they were trying to break into his car, Derek Vinyard (Norton) is sent up the river for three years, a journey he will never forget.  When he is released, Derek seems to have changed a whole lot while he was in prison and as soon as he gets home, he tells his young brother (Edward Furlong) who looks up to him as if he were looking up to God, that he doesn't want him to get involved in the Nazi community as he did.  He also tells his kid brother not to attend a Nazi party that is held the same night Derek just got out.  Not listening to his big brother, Danny attends the party and is caught red-handed by Derek. 
  It is at the party that we see just how much Derek has changed.  He even goes so far as to asking his girlfriend to follow him by leaving the Nazi party and its community for ever. After she refuses, Derek finds his brother Danny at the party and escapes with him.  After the escape, Derek tells Danny what happened to him in jail and makes him understand why he changed and why Danny should as well.  The movie doesn't have any flaws and is powerful all along.

257,eonbluedan-1,Blistering!,10,22 January 2011,"My introduction to the screen presence that is Edward Norton, this film is astonishing. Norton OWNS this movie, and apparently not just on screen; legend has it that Tony Kaye disowned his film, as he was ultimately not happy with how it came out, and that there was major turmoil between him and the principal cast. You would not know, going by what you get as the final product (it makes me curious how different Kaye's vision was to begin with).A powerful piece of work from beginning to end, it is uncompromising. It presents the story very much from a ""Devil's Advocate"" point of view; Norton's character is presented as intelligent, and in his twisted way, a caring brother, son and boyfriend. It presents the neo-Nazi argument as one that you can ALMOST understand and empathise with. Some would say this is dangerous, but I believe it is just honest and intelligent storytelling.It is not just in the way the story is told that it pulls no punches; the violence is tough and unflinching, showing just a bit more than you feel you need to see, to drive the point home. The now infamous ""bite the kerb"" scene remains one that scars you for some time. The film's finale is still one of the most surprising, shocking and poignant I can think of. The message of the film regarding hate and anger is brilliantly stated in the final act. Performances from a stellar cast, headed by Ed Norton in what remains his most controversial and powerful screen role.Approach with some caution, but definitely approach!",American History X
258,AbhiMathews,More Than Just A Movie,10,14 September 2013,"Watching movies has evolved into a passion of mine since I just regularly watched them for entertainment. In the past, I would simply turn the television on, pop a CD and watch for about two hours. This no longer happens.American History X is a truly wonderful film. It offers thought provoking discussions, an emotional plot and a story we can all learn lessons from. Over the years, watching movies as a hobby has transformed into a learning experience--one where the viewer is a student who witnesses the events transpiring. As the students, you start to see American History X is more than a single class where insolent children have catharsis; it's a place of growth where boys become men. People argue that you never really value something until you feel pain like the characters in this movie. The relationship issues, pursuit for happiness, thoughts of loneliness and anger that builds up inside are emotions we all feel. Maybe we never actually do realize the importance of others and the values we hold until a traumatic event occurs, but this movie certainly comes close.",American History X

Through the narration of his little brother Danny we learn the real roots of his brothers anger and brutality, he once was a bright young man until the death of their father which deeply affected him. Derek grew into a neo-nazi skinhead and the number 2 of a violent white supremacist gang that gained some notoriety in L.A. for the heinous racially motivated crimes they committed. Once locked away Derek finally gains some perspective befriending another black inmate and listening for once. Three years in prison can change a lot in a man, Derek has an earth shattering moment in prison that changed him forever and he was never quite the same again. Now reformed he is in a race against time to sever ties from his following, reconcile with his mother and sister, and prevent his little brother Danny from succumbing to the same grim fate.

260,Manal1987,Highly overrated,8,5 October 2010,"Totally loved it. But I'm a little bit disappointed I have to admit! The reviews I read prior watching American History X, and the fact that it was ranked one of the best movies of all time made me set the bar really high up. And during my two-hour view I was waiting for that moment when I'll be truly AWED. It didn't come though! I was highly entertained and thought-provoked... but never touched. The movie digs deep into one of the most unsettling problems in the American society (and it makes me think maybe I'd be more touched if I were an American myself!) and materializes its social impact. Director Tony Kaye did a great job shockingly portraying the gruesome and painful outcomes of this vicious circle of hate. However, he heavily depended on melodramatic score and slow-motioned takes and flashbacks to heighten this effect, which, I think, was quite cheesy. The movie is beautifully written, and wonderfully performed. Edward Norton has this magnetic charisma that you can't help waiting for the next scene he'll be in. His performance is naturally flawless. The young Edward Furlong pulled it off brilliantly as well.",American History X

262,tjsdshpnd,Controverial but a must watch,9,17 June 2009,"To start off, this was an extremely controversial movie when it was released.Maybe because of the racist, anti-black, anti-immigration, anti-Jewish, anti-Asian, anti- Hispanic etc etc remarks made continuously in the movie. This movie is actually divided into two parts and has a non-linear style of narration. The two parts being the flashback and the current scenario. The director has interestingly given a different look to both the parts with the help of colors. The flashback is depicted by black and white frames while the current part is depicted by normal color. The movie contains violence, sometimes very gory violence that may turn your eyes off the screen. It contains some statements which you may not agree with. But as a movie, it is a complete experience. The transition of the protagonist from a racial, neo-nazi skinhead to a caring, understanding guy who understands that it is not the color that determines a person, but his nature is put very underminingly by the director. His urge to stop his brother from going his way and spoil his life is depicted wonderfully. The part of the story in jail where Norton understands that he is wrong and has a radical transformation was done without preaching and high melodrama which is the case with many other movies.On the acting front, Edward Norton is anyways one of my favorite actors and in this movie all his acting prowess is put to the test and without any surprise he delivers . All the other actors especially Edward Furlong fit the bill perfectly . In short Controversial but a must watch Rating : 8.5/10",American History X
263,walken_on_sunshine,American History X:The Doc's Review,10,19 June 2006,"Much like the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan American History X will be a movie you will never forget.Probably the most realistic portrayal of racism other than Crash.This film is full of so much passion everyone is always angry and intense.The best thing is that each point the movie makes is valid and understandable whether it be coming from the ""gangsta's"" or the ""neo Nazis's"" the message is loud and clear.The characters are all again realistic to an extent.The films best quality is how it shows that one decision leads to consequence after consequence until it's too late to do anything to fix it.A very realistic portrayal of prison is only one of the disturbing sequences this film contains.Every death is brutal and difficult to watch as is the anal rape scene and the grocery store robbery.They all however are needed to be shown because without the unbearably brutal violence the message wouldn't hit as hard.The film is not slow paced as many may assume and that is why i prefer it to Crash.While Crash was brilliant American History X is more extreme and more true to real life and in my view more likely to hit home.Overall American History X is a timeless classic with a moving story about a character who you cannot stand becoming the character you root for after he realizes his mistakes.An enjoyable film that is definitely not for kids.",American History X

I've never seen a movie like this before, I mean it made my hairs on my neck stand on end. Edward Norton gives the most outstanding performance that I've seen in years from any actor. This film takes a straight up look at Neo Nazisim with very little held back. Shows how racism is everywhere in this society and is a wake up call to suburban North America. Any racists whom have seen this will have to do a little soul searching after this one. Very well layed out, very powerful. Quite possible one of the greatest films ever made.Edward Norton deserves a Golden Globe, and Oscar and whatever else they can reward him with. Consider this amount of talent.

267,alexkolokotronis,The Most Dangerous Person To Us Is Ourselves,10,1 February 2009,"American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.Who better than to display these wild but common complexities within people than Edward Norton. The range he shows here is astounding in only his fifth movie. Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a skin head that realizes through cruel yet necessary events in his life that he has gone down the wrong path. When he comes out of jail he attempts to stop his brother played Edward Furlong from going down the same road he had done. Through all his efforts though some things just prove to be inevitable. Avery Brooks also gives a great performance as Derek Vinyard's former teacher and now principal of his former school. His words may not be of the most inspiring but his actions and messages sent across are subtle yet strong and to the point.Norton's performance though wasn't just about range but exploring different dimensions of life. Whether it proved to be psychological, social or even political on a certain level. It is a transforming performance revealing something mind blowing and eye opening. That we, and this includes anyone, can take a devastating turn in life no matter how intelligent we are or thoughtful. That the person that determines the outcome of your life is yourself whether it is good or bad. Norton's realizations aren't through teachings such as the ones that got him in jail but they are through the events in the time he spent in jail. He saw the truth for himself realizing then what is false and what is real.The screenplay written by David McKenna is about as versatile as the performance Norton gives. Not only because of the Derek Vinyard character but because of the characters involved in his life. For example the root of his evil did not come from the murder of his father but rather his father himself. Through just a conversation at breakfast did his negative thoughts get really embedded eventually then leading to them dramatically taking over his mind and way of life. Only when his father got killed did these negative thoughts seem justified. The way this screenplay and direction was able to display this message in just a plethora of other underlying tones was spectacular.What makes this movie great though is that you can truly find yourself in the messages delivered. As much as the main character might not seem relevant or connected to many people it his emotions and functioning of his mind that all of us are able to connect with. Yet what makes a movie great is not simply the message or messages sent across but how powerfully they are delivered. American History X delivers its multiple and intertwining messages about as powerfully as I've seen from a film.",American History X
268,muons,An unimpressive family drama which fails to deliver,5,16 July 2018,"This is a bland story of a white supremacist and his transformation following his jail term. Despite all the hype and awards, I fail to see anything special about the movie. At times, Derek's long boring monologues almost put me asleep. Take the scene, for example, including the jewish history teacher at family dinner table. On the surface, there's tension and drama but the whole subplot is kept so long with a stale and contrived dialogue that the tension can't be sustained and the audience is tired. Derek's transform from an effervescent skinhead to a contrite preacher also looks very cliche and cheesy. A laundry boy's unilateral clownish acts towards an obnoxious working partner eventually warms up Neo-Nazi's heart and he repents of his past. Besides that some things don't add up at all. While Derek disapproves of his neo-nazi prison gang's dealings with hispanics, he is punished by the gang because he plays basketball with black inmates. Later, when he refuses to join the gang and chooses solitude in prison, the gang which were initially brutal towards him simply let him go. The female characters of the family are poorly developed and shown weak and subdued. The mother is totally indifferent to her sons' street activities. Their room is decorated with swastika flags and all sorts of white supremacist trash, which screams trouble but all she does is to smoke and cough in her bedroom. When the younger one follows the footsteps of the older sibling in prison, she then remembers to ask for help. Why doesn't she act before? Towards the end of the movie, it turns out the racism runs deep in the family starting with the slain dad. But that thread is not followed further. Ed Norton's acting is in general good but far from Oscar worthy. All in all, this is an ordinary crime story and family drama with gazillions of clones produced as tv series or dvd bin movies.",American History X
269,fleagles,An amazing film in its story and acting,8,7 September 2000,"Edward Norton gives an incredible performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-Nazi who goes to prison for murder, and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who worships Derek, and who is heading along the same disturbing path.  This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film. Norton is amazing - He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You.  His buffed-up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic).  His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town.  First-time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember. This film will make you think about racism, Neo-Nazism, politics & race, and where hate really comes from - it is passed along from parent to child.Vote: 8",American History X

You will not find one film with Norton that is just a walk-through picture.  American History X is most certainly one of the most thought-provoking movies he has ever done.  The story of a neo-nazi who goes through an ideological change in prison when he is befriended by a black man is very good.  But, Norton makes the story even better by giving his character a lot of intelligence.  I have to admit that although I disagree with EVERYTHING that the Norton character said before his conversion, he is the ONLY character of this kind who actually has intelligent, well thought out reasons for what he believes.",American History X
272,McFrogg,"A fascinating look into the minds of Hollywood liberals,",1,9 May 2017,"American History X has a good message. Hate and racism is very bad. Unfortunately, so is the movie. I can't believe that this movie is considered such a masterpiece. I'm not even sure if this movie is serious or not. Is it a piece of liberal propaganda, or is it a satirical comedy made by a conservative who wanted to show us how many liberals see the world? Most likely it's propaganda...but sometimes it's hard to tell.Because most of the time, it's not even about real racism. Except for some hateful comments, most of what Derek (and his father) says during the dinner table scenes isn't shocking at all. A black person could have said the exact same thing. The filmmakers took valid political positions and added a small pinch of Adolf.According to American History X, you're racist if you're against affirmative action. The movie also seems to say that black people are animals. They're not responsible for their own actions. They commit acts like rioting and looting because they're scared of white people or angry because of the oppression. The movie is mostly remembered for two things: the gay prison scene and the curb stomping. Everyone is talking about those two scenes when they bring up the movie. I almost think the filmmakers did it on purpose, they added shocking stuff so that people would talk about it. I remember that all the ""cool"" kids bragged about having seen the part where the nazi is violated in the shower.There's also a completely pointless sex scene right before the curb stomping. I wonder why the director thought that was a good idea. But then I remember all of the other bizarre stuff in the movie. Derek's transformation from nice young man to a neo-nazi is not convincing at all. ""It's nagger bullshot, son!"" ""Gee, dad, I guess you're right! Racism is awesome!"" And his transformation from a neo-nazi to Gandhi. ""Haha, a funny magical negro! Who knew that black people had the ability to tell jokes? And he hates the KKK too, what are the odds? We have so much in common..!"" At the end of the movie, Derek's brother is shot to death by a black kid. It's just a pointless and depressing ending. It doesn't offer any hope at all. It's sad that American History X is one of the most popular movies about racism. Imagine if they made a movie about real racism, without magical negroes, fake neo-Nazis, liberal propaganda and unnecessary graphic violence and sex. A movie that treated black people like humans. The real Nazis here are the filmmakers. American History X is just a piece of propaganda made by a modern-day Goebbels, designed to make viewers think that conservatives are Nazis and that black people are helpless animals.",American History X
273,Manthorpe,Not all that it's cracked up to be...disappointing.,7,6 February 2004,"Derrick Vinyard (Norton) is thrown in jail because he brutally murdered two black men one fateful evening when they tried to steal his car. He is a monster of a Nazi and is quite well known around the community as such. While in prison, Derek has had time to think and he realizes that his reasons for believing in what he does are complete and total frauds. His younger brother Danny (Furlong) seems to be heading down the same path. Can Derek convince his brother to change his ways before it's too late?Ed Norton deserves all the credit he receives as a talented actor, and he definitely shows off his skills here. It's hard to believe that he's the same skinny weakling that he portrayed in Fight Club. He's a big muscle bound monster filled with hate for the first portion of the film and is then transformed into a man that has seen the light and faults in his ways. Top notch actor. Edward Furlong, despite being in only a few films, also shows off his acting abilities...however, neither one of them could save this film.Minor Spoilers:The premise of the movie itself would make it worthy of being in the Top 250, however it has serious flaws in execution and especially the script, as it's filled with entirely unbelievable situations. Too bad because I really wanted to like this one. Nazis playing basketball with local black gangs? Um, yeah m'kay? But a bigger flaw has to be Derek's reasons for having the beliefs he does and the reasons he changed them. His racist beliefs stem from his father's dislike for minorities and from his death in which he is killed by black people while trying to put out a fire in a crackhouse. The latter is believable but the look into his father's beliefs in the dinner scene was entirely unnecessary and laughable at best. Once in the slammer, he makes friends with a black inmate who enlightens Derek's view by telling him sex jokes. And although Derek has had the Nazi beliefs he has had for many years, a simple joke or two and getting rammed in the bootay by fellow Nazis in prison sway his opinion to the opposite. It could happen right?The ending was what really put me off though and is the main reason why the movie showed itself, to me, to be pretentious. It would have made infinitely more sense had Derek been killed, but having Danny killed for simply blowing smoke in some black kids face is a serious flaw concocted by the makers, and is again, unbelievable. It makes me wonder what they actually thought when they first read the script. I guess they figured it would blow the audience away as there would be no way for them to foresee the final events. I believe that most people fell for this simple trick and is most of the reason why this film has such a lofty rating here at IMDB. Ideally, Danny's life should have been spared for Derek's redemption. Sure, it would've been a ""happy"" ending, but what we are left with is much worse. Groan.This film left me very disappointed as I was looking forward to it's story and had heard many good things about it. However, the movie is simply not believable. A movie dealing with real issues needs to be, I don't know, more realistic.Great acting, decent camera work, but terrible script.

276,J-bot6,Pretty good. A few minor tweaks would make it even better.,7,21 September 2016,"** This contains spoilers! **Edward Norton is frighteningly believable as a skinhead in this movie. In general, I thought the acting was good. This movie is kind of like The Shawshank Redemption -- except with less hair. It's well shot and edited. The pacing slows down a bit for the second half (which is pretty typical of most film plot arcs). However, it delivers the goods. One issue I had with this movie is that it borders on being a bit too soft in certain areas. For example, Derek's character changes a bit too quickly. I understand that there's limited time in a single film to explore a person's change of heart. To that end, having him not cry after he gets prison-raped would have been a better way to go. A guy that's actually that pis*ed off and aggressive would not cry in a situation like that. He'd be upset -- no doubt, but he wouldn't break like that. It would be more believable if he reacted like someone who was injured in a fight and genuinely insulted and even embarrassed (but not willing to show it). More stoic is what I'm thinking here. The crying should have only happened once in the film and that's at the end when his brother dies. That would give the death scene at the end even more weight. At the end of the day, Derek cares about his family and that's the secret to cracking his armor.",American History X
277,Tom Murray,A study of the causes of racism.,9,21 October 2000,"Man is a territorial animal. He will defend his property, often to the death. People put up fences; countries put up borders; wars are fought over control of territory. Man can, for a variety of reasons, also be nomadic. When one group of people moves into the territory of another, there will be animosity: Scottish Protestants emigrated to Catholic Ulster; Jews emigrated to Palestine and turned part of it into Israel; Europeans emigrated to America and displaced the natives. Attempts are being made to achieve some sort of reconciliation in these cases but the bitterness and hatred, caused by past revenge, make success difficult. When animosity exists between different races, it is called racism but it is no different than when the two contending groups are of the same ethnic background, as with the Scots and the Irish: both Celtic. It only matters that the two groups perceive of themselves as different in some way, even in ways that others would consider insignificant. American History X is about the racism created when blacks moved into the white Venice Beach section of Los Angeles. Derek's father was murdered by blacks and he desires revenge. He joins a Neo-Nazi group and becomes a highly respected leader. His opportunity for revenge comes when three blacks attempt to steal his car; he viciously murders two of them. Lack of witnesses allows him to escape a murder conviction and he spends only a few years in jail. During that time, he becomes disillusioned with other Neo-Nazis in the prison and he leaves them, and their protection. Miraculously, the blacks leave him alone, because he has befriended one of them, partly because of the influence of a black teacher, whom Derek respects, and who is always working for reconciliation and partly because his black friend accepted him, right from the start. This friendship causes him to abandon his hatred of blacks and feel remorse for his acts. When released from prison, Derek finds that his younger brother, Danny, has become a member of the same Neo-Nazi group and Derek attempts to free him from their influence. However, past actions have already made tragic events inevitable. The film is very intense. It left me feeling emotionally exhausted but very glad to have seen it and wanting to see it again. The acting is superb; the writing is very powerful; the characters are well developed and we care deeply about what happens to these two brothers. The central premise of the film is that reconciliation, however difficult, might be possible, if we strive for it diligently and with understanding.",American History X

This one has to be one of his most deserving performance to receive an award. Certainly one of the few comments I've read, you got hauled into his character. And indeed it proved true. Edward Norton's character has a very captivating aura. In the first place we see him a complete racist freak, who's blinded so much with hatred and rage. Then we see him gradually cools down (when he got in jail). And we finally see a complete shift of his character from a cruel racist to a peaceful friendly man who doesn't care what's your color. Edward Norton had performed this character really well, and I mean truly well. You can feel the imbibed hatred and rage in his heart when he condemns and spit off the existence of blacks in their country. He even had gone to his limits (even hurting his family, blinded by rage), and this gave me the chills! Made me even squirm in my seat! Especially when I saw him so mad in a meal discussion throwing off their viewpoints concerning blacks and other foreign immigrants of their country of who's got the right and who's out. His younger brother in the film, like anyone else idolizes his brother and we see throughout as well how he transformed. I love the structure of the story. The film doesn't only give me the reason to like it because of the actors' ability to portray their role. The story has something in reality, very genuine and sublime.

However, in some ways he can be seen as every bit as manipulative as the Stacy Keach character, albeit for the forces of good. In the world I live in people are seldom so clear cut.",American History X
282,segacs,Disturbing and powerful,8,23 December 2006,"American History X stars Edward Norton as a racist, xenophobic skinhead who is convicted of murder and sent to prison. It follows the effect of this on his family, specifically on his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, who idolizes him and yearns to follow in his footsteps.The movie is powerful and disturbing in the insider's look it gives us into the dark world of violent racist skinhead groups. For this reason, it is very difficult to watch. But it's an important film, because it tackles a subject that Hollywood is usually content to shy away from.Edward Norton, always one of my favourite actors, has one of his best roles of all time here. He is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Derek Vinyard, a character whose charisma and intelligence could have led him down pretty much any path, but who chose the wrong road. How many infamous men in history have had the exact same qualities? Countless. Norton embraces the role, wholly embodying the most terrible qualities of his character, and refusing to shy away from giving his all to even the most difficult scenes. He has even transformed his entire body to play this part (compare his muscular build here to his scrawniness in ""Fight Club"", for instance). Norton is so believable, and so compelling to watch, that it's all too easy to see how he could have recruited and inspired so many people to his fanatically hateful ideology. Also brilliant is Avery Brooks as the schoolteacher who tries so hard to redeem Derek when most people would have written him off long ago. Notable among smaller roles are performances by Fairuza Balk as Vinyard's girlfriend and Beverly D'Angelo as his conflicted mother. This is a dramatic film, and the acting has made it what it is.My criticisms are few. Furlong's acting isn't quite as strong - at times it seems like he's reading lines aloud for a teacher. And without giving too much away, the ending comes across as a bit too contrived. At times, the movie skirts dangerously close to after-school-special territory, and it can be a bit heavy-handed in its preachiness. It's not a perfect film, by any means.But it's a provocative film, one that I urge parents to watch with their teenagers and that is sure to open up a lot of discussion. A must-see.",American History X

284,Primtime,One of the best of 1998,8,18 August 1999,"American History X is a startling film that never lacks focus in its portrayal of a white racist; both in his learning and departure of the extremest beliefs. Kaye's debut is something he should be proud of, rather than trying to distance himself from the project. Each and every shot is well taken and the story, although constantly changing from past to present, flows like few other films do. Dealing with such a subject matter with force and staying neutral is an accomplishment in itself.Edward Norton's performance definitely merited the Oscar nod. Scenes in which he shows rage and anger towards Blacks, Jews or even members of his own family are what make this film what it is. Very few actors could have pulled this role off (think of Ben Affleck in this role instead and you will follow). Norton also shows the other side of his acting ability frequently in the film and is especially potent towards the end. This role moves Norton into the upper echelon of actors that can carry a film on their own. Without Norton, there is no American History X.The supporting cast all play their role to par. Edward Furlong does well in the role of the younger brother, although he is no Norton. Stacy Keach plays the leader of the skinheads very well and should have had a greater presence in the film. Beverly D'Angelo, John Avery and Elliot Gould round up the cast, all giving their usual smart performances. The only problem I has with this film was the manner in which Norton's character is such an extreme racist and is changed so quickly. Without giving away the reason, and a good one it may be, I felt that the sudden change took away credibility from the story. Perhaps this was one of the points that Norton and Kaye disagreed on.Regardless of any squabbles that may have occured between Kaye and Norton, this film is still one of the best of 1998. I would surely like to find out what the disagreement was about and whether it was personal or film-based.
This full gets a full recommendation.8/10 stars.",American History X
285,james362001,Edward Norton's tour de force,8,17 September 2001,"I had never seen Edward Norton befor I saw ""American History X"".  After the end of this film I realized this man has impeccable acting talent and is the next man to win an Academy Award in the near future.  He was nominated for his role in ""American History X"".  You might say this is Edward Norton's tour de force and I was so mesmerized by his performance, almost hypnotic. Don't be frightened away by Edward Norton.  This character is nothing like the actor, down-to-earth Edward Norton.  See him in other films, ""Primal Fear"" and ""Keeping The Faith"".  You will become a fan of his too.                          This film is about a Skinhead who gets revenge of the bad black men for vandalizing his car.  His little brother idolizes him.  I will not say anymore about the plot, but every person who is fed up with the neighborhood they live in and every parent who would like their teenager to be on the right path should watch this film.  Please discuss this film with your child.                                                            Skinheads, Nazi's and violent black people just is not my thing to watch in a movie, but ""American History X"" is the exception.  It is very realistic and there is a message here for all.

286,martinsplads,Racism ain't cool bro,9,26 February 2019,"American History X stars off very brutal and meaningless. But slowly as the film proceeds you scene after scene you feel that the main character played wonderfully by Edward Norton is another person then the terrifying psychopath you see from the first insane violent scene that is just good damn pointless. And when Nortons character changes for the better, is it his little brother played by Edward Furlong that is the new racist black sheep in the family that the big brother have to set on the path of good before its to late. This is the best film about racism ever made. It just sucks you in to this unfair world where nothing makes sense at all. I just love that a bad guy becomes good and finds his humanity its makes you feel good cause there is always a light in the end of the tunnel when evil appears. As I said before, the acting by the two Edwards is amazing and the movie just show how bad racism really is and why you should defently avoid at all cost.",American History X
287,Film Dog,An Edward Norton prediction,9,15 September 1999,"I predict that in the future we will be seeing alot of Edward Norton in alot of juicy roles.  Who would have dreamed the baby faced kid in 'Primal Fear' could have pulled off a performance such as the one he gave as Derek?  I'll bet there were alot of auditions for this role.  I'll also bet that, once Norton did his thing, it was a slam-dunk.  Simply incredible and, disturbingly, incredibly believable.  Then again, he was aided by a fantastic script.  Playing the role as a very intelligent, though misguided young man, I found it hard to argue with his logic, twisted as it was (think about the scene at the dinner table).  That bothered me.  This guy is going to go a long, long, way.  Maybe another Robert DeNiro.  Just hope he doesn't O.D. on gangster roles.  Too much of a good thing, ya know?stanhejl@netscape.net",American History X
288,Tetsel,Edward Norton: the next De Niro,8,31 May 1999,"Though this story is well told and nicely directed, it is Edward Norton who makes the film as good as it is. Ranging from pre- Nazi school nerd to post- prison adult, with a fabulously scary Neo - Nazi in between, he was well deserving of his Academy Award nomination. Not since early Robert De Niro films have I seen a young actor with such range, potential, and talent. I remember being impressed with his brilliant ""rookie"" year, 1996, when he appeared in Everyone Says I Love You, The People vs. Larry Flynt and Primal Fear. Now it seems he has taken the next step towards being one of the great actors. His portrayal of Worm in Rounders was solid, and Derek in AmerHistX is nothing short of brilliant. Look for him in the upcoming Fight Club and his directorial debut next year : Keeping the Faith.",American History X
289,bedazzle,excellent,8,12 April 2001,"Excellent depiction of racism's characteristics and causes. Also, I enjoyed the various subgroups and interactions of prison inmates, skin heads and gang members. A powerful movie that everyone should see. 9 of 10.

290,raymond_chandler,"""Has anything you've done made your life better?""",9,29 July 2001,"I will always regret not seeing this for the first time in a theatre. Even on video, the impact is staggering. Certain scenes, notably the two discussions at the dinner table ('Rodney King' and 'Native Son'), Derek's confrontation with Cameron at the party, and, for me, Derek's memories of himself and Danny at the seashore, are classic examples of what intelligent movie-making can be. The violence in this film is totally in the context of the story, and therefore all the more shocking for it. These are characters we grow to know and like, and their motivations are those of real people. This kind of film, which tackles tough, meaningful issues in the lives of everyday people, is all too rare these days. Derek's speeches as a skinhead illustrate why this is not a simple problem to resolve, but the film itself resoundingly discredits violence as a solution. Edward Norton will never deliver a finer-crafted, more-nuanced performance. Some of his roles have been showy (""Primal Fear"", ""The Score""), but here he creates a fully-realized, immensely complex person. Derek Vinyard is an archetypal character in cinema, and Norton's portrayal will be talked about for many years to come. But the rest of the cast is superb as well. Stacy Keach underplays Cameron beautifully, making him frighteningly ordinary, instead of a nutcase. Guy Torry is so likable as Lamont that he makes Derek's transformation believable. Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo, and Jennifer Lien give dignity and depth to what could have been throwaway roles. Even Edward Furlong, normally an actor I find annoying, elevates his game here - check out the scenes with his little sister and when he is just starting to write his paper. I have seen this movie many times now, and I really believe each time that these people are Derek's family.
 The structure of the film is one of its greatest strengths. The contrast between Derek now and Derek then is so stark that we are compelled to find out what changed him. On repeated viewings, you can see that he is the same person - charismatic, no-nonsense, passionate - but the older Derek has let go of his hate. The use of black-and-white makes it easy to follow the sequence of events, even though the flashback scenes are not presented chronologically. Every scene, every line adds to the overall effect. This is a landmark film, no doubt about it.",American History X
291,Mcnabbbeasty,Unbelievably Powerful; An Essential Movie Watching Experience.,9,26 July 2020,"A true masterpiece, American History X is a movie I feel everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.

Edward Norton displayed one of my favorite performances ever as the most powerfully redeeming character in maybe the history of cinema. All people can change.",American History X
292,xmdbx,It's All Ridiculous,3,19 November 2019,"This movie is seriously flawed. Like everything about it is flawed. The slow motion is dreadful, the flashback scenes are almost always terrible and the message is ridiculous. A few specific awful pieces of the film include the fact that Danny has a single night to write this paper and does so with the eloquence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the entire basketball game scene and how much blood Danny has in his body. But the worst part of the movie is definitely the idea that Derek needed to meet a nice black person in order for him to change his views. I get it has to do with him being sheltered and closed-minded but it doesn't make sense and gives the viewer a horrible idea of how racial differences can be solved. The film tries to push an agenda on the audience so hard and, at least in my eyes, falls flat on its face with its most important message. It's a major problem when a character's white supremacy rhetoric makes more sense than his reason for being reformed. There are countless cliches and more moments of bad acting. I don't think Norton did anything special and nobody else was good.",American History X

294,emdoub,A tremendous disappointment,5,29 November 2005,"Great casting, excellent acting, marvelous cinematography. Truly, a finely-crafted film.Unfortunately, all of this wonderful story-telling expertise is used to tell a story that is as satisfying as one that ends with ""and then the little boy fell out of bed and woke up"".*** MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW *** The ""moral"" of this story is, apparently, that it's racist to stand up to bullies if they're African-American, and it'll get you shot - and it'll be the fault of your racist older brother, because he led you down a skinhead path.The skinheads are portrayed as remarkably unlovely people. It's true - racism is ugly, and it's possible that skinheads are that badly over the top in their social skills and attitude. But the cinematic debate that is the heart of this film is remarkably one-sided. We are not shown examples that disprove the racial stereotypes examined, we're shown examples of the people with legitimate complaints over-reacting, or degenerating into absurd complaints.This movie examines race relations in the USA - and Ghu knows that they need to be looked at. Racism is a real problem. Pointing a finger at white extremists is not going to be effective - looking at all aspects of the problem may help, though it may be less comfortable. It's a complex problem - the simple source that this movie looks at does little to illuminate that. In portraying the wrong-headedness of white supremacists while glossing over their legitimate complaints, the movie becomes racist itself.For a far better movie that examines this problem, I highly recommend Crash, which can be seen at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/",American History X
295,alexklatt-28518,IT MEANS NOT WELCOME,7,6 August 2019,"This is a great movie. Its non-chronological storytelling is easy to follow and effective.

It's cheesy or funny at times, but mostly poignant and entertaining.",American History X
296,Pelrad,RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGIC,9,13 April 1999,"THERE ARE MANY MORE RACES THAN THE BLACK AND THE WHITEAmerican History X is about racism, but more exclusively about the tensions between the white and black races, so deeply-rooted in the U.S.. Yes, black people make up the largest minority in that land - I believe about 10% of the population - but U.S. film-makers are becoming a little more awake, beginning to touch upon the lives of other races. For example, another 1998 film, ""Smoke Signals"" dealt with two Native people. American History X, thoughtfully touches - though in a low-key way - upon other races, like the Koreans who ""took over"" ownership of the grocery store.When I was in the most racially diverse region of the world (the Caribbean), I observed how interracial marriage both preserves that diversity while creating unity. When a black person marries a white person, one child will come out completely black, one completely white, and one a beautiful mixture between the two. (Blondes and brunettes intermarry and we have not eradicated these hair colours creating an exclusively brown-haired society!)RACISTS CANNOT BE REFORMED BY LOGICSome people were understandably upset that the film failed to ""rebut"" many of the arguments in favour of the Neo-Nazis. I thought that the brilliance of the film was that it subtly argued that this was futile. Rebuttals on one side are only met with rebuttals on the other and so the argument goes on back and forth endlessly. The arguments at the dinner table with the Elliot Gould character confirmed this. The film showed that reforming a racist is done not through appealing to his mind, his logic, his reason, but through his heart. Those that marvelled in wonderment over Derek's black laundry co-worker befriending him with humour about sex, thinking that it would have been more reasonable for him to argue racial issues failed to see this point I think.The film pointed out how self-defeating the ideals of white supremacy (or supremacy of any race) are by showing how illogical the beliefs are. At one point, the younger brother states that it is best to steer clear away from anyone who is not a White Protestant in the midst of his insisting on doing away with Jews. Of course, the founder of Christianity, a faction of which is Protestantism, was a Jew! Another point that shows how self-defeating their beliefs are is that they want to do away with immigration. But their ancestors, themselves, were immigrants. All whites immigrated to the Americas from Europe. They never asked for permission from the Native people. The characters do take up this point and try to argue that the whites were good immigrants because they built up a great civilisation. But it is crystal clear how weak that argument is.""American History X"" shows us that it is nearly futile to try to reform a racist by appealing to his faculty of reason, because his beliefs are not based upon reason, they are based upon emotional hatred. Derek's laundry co-worker began joking about an unrelated issue, an issue which Derek could not argue against and set up defences against his own point of view. The wall of hatred around his heart was penetrated. Blacks and whites actually had something in common that they could laugh about!  The mind can only be righted through appealing to the heart. This is the central message of ""American History X"".NOT INTENDED TO BE A PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDYAnother criticism given to the film was that it was unclear how Derek was led down the path of racism. It was commented that it was initiated by his father using the 'n' word at the dinner table and by the fact that he was murdered by black people. It didn't seem to me that the film was saying that these were the exclusive reasons for Derek's embrace of racist views. It was just pointing out a few of the many fragments off of which he fed along this dark path. ""American History X"" was not aspiring to be a psychological study of how people become racists. It was simply revealing the darkness of racial hatred. I'm sure that such a psychological study could not be satisfactorily concluded in a two-hour non-documentary film; it is a complex issue. There is no one cause, and outside incidents are just a pat on the back, because everyone has free will to embrace whatever beliefs he chooses.CONFUSION OF ECONOMIC VERSUS HUMAN ISSUESMany people, also, seem to confuse economic issues with human ones. Racism is not a ""right-wing"" issue. ""Right-wing"" vs. ""left-wing"" are policies of economics. They have to do with such issues of public versus private ownership. A person can embrace the economic theory of capitalism and be a strong proponent of racial equality; while, another can side-with socialism and be a racist.HOW DO YOU REMOVE DARKNESS FROM A ROOM?The film's ending has its pro's and con's. One the one hand, yes, it is conventional, but on the other, it allows the film to leave an emotional impression on the viewer which helps him to reflect on all that he has seen.In conclusion, ""American History X"" pointed out to me that hatred (""hate"" is the verb, ""hatred"" is the noun, please), like darkness, hatred cannot be depleted by attacking it. You can't remove darkness out of a room by shovelling it out, only by turning up the light of love which automatically dispels the darkness away.The films advises that one should always end a piece of writing with a quote, so here's one. It is paraphrased from the sayings of Gandhi:""If you simply take an eye for an eye, it won't be long before the whole world goes blind."" (9 out of 10)",American History X
297,TroyeEvans,Inspiring Story about Racism,5,14 April 2012,"There is no need to remind you of the dark nature of this story. It's intense and violent throughout; the profanity is perpetually spread. But for those who admire the film, they admire in another angle. This is an interesting film that makes me reflect and inspires the way we think about this society.American History X is a story depicting a profound relationship between two brothers, and the family as a whole. It is a story about racism, a story of bravery and redemption. It shows the truth: sometimes it takes experiences to see the light, and sometimes it takes time and strength to overcome your past and mistakes. But it is also cruel in a sense, though it is the ultimate truth: even if you try so hard, your mistakes can still haunt you and the ones around you.Edward Norton shines like a diamond for his performance as the big brother with a dark past who strives to prevent his little brother from walking down the same path. Frankly it's easily one of the most outstanding performances I've ever seen in movies.This film has depth which one must explore and experience by himself.

298,bulleetz37235,Provocative,9,17 September 2005,"American History X is a film that on first impression is artistic, yet quite touchy. It raises themes that you don't really want to watch. Racism, violence and segregation - to name a few.The story is about the Vinyard family. And their involvement with Neo-Nazi racism groups. Derek Vinyard (The ever-fabulous Edward Norton) is the main man. A tough rogue filled with hatred and bitterness against other races, and convinced he must fight against them as a white protestant male. Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is his brother, an impressionable teen who admires his brother above all others.---The story is harsh though, and told in very interesting ways. Part of it is flashback, part of it present time, part of it is narration by Norton telling of his time spent in prison, for the murder of a black man. And even more imaginative is the way in which events surrounding the racial antagonism are commented and shown via an essay of which Danny is forced to write for the principal of his school, an essay for his own special class - namely - American History X, which is hoped to bring down the hateful feelings, and inflict some sense into him. With a bunch of gangster chums around the place, exerting and trying to encourage racial hatred it isn't easy. And many fights are depicted. Struggles.But this film, which is phenomenally brutal, but effective has a big message to convey, and it does it well. Racism is just a case of hate, and being annoyed at things... And is totally wrong.I love this picture, it is well made, well acted and well received.It is also very deep. Making it absorbing and a grand viewing pleasure, even if it is brutal, and brash. This quote may help you understand how deep it is, a passage from Danny's essay:""So here's what I found out. My conclusion. I figured out that hate is baggage.

299,DorianWynHowells,A very powerful film!,10,21 January 2002,"A mate of mine suggested this film to me, and I found it to be the most thought provoking film I have seen in many years. This film challenges the viewer from beginning to end.This film is so important. It takes a very serious subject - rascism, Neo Nazi beliefs - and dissects and analyzes the effects it has on the a) Protaganists. b) Victims. c) Societies. Edward Norton, still relatively unknown when he made this film, gives a gritty, realistic, and overwhelming performance as Derek Vinyard. His transformation from hate fuelled Neo Nazi to understanding rehabilitated young man, deserved an Oscar. That's how good he is! He is electric.This film also features the most shocking piece of cinema I have ever witnessed! The scene where Derek executes a burglar, who also happens to be black. There has been much controversy over the inclusion of this scene in the finished film, and it's a good thing that this scene was allowed in because we need to see this scene to see how violent, and brutal Derek was before his transformation. We needed to see that scene to show us the way in which he felt about black people. Derek was a creation. He was a product. Of a man who believed that black people are worthless. What's more frightening is that this man, was a product of another man's beliefs and hate, and so it goes. Who do we blame? Is there any Blame? This is the film's ultimate question.Edward Furlong gives a very good performance as Derek's younger brother. He too is being corrupted, just like Derek had been, and this brainwashing is what the film highlights most.The film is not one I can review lightly, it's a very serious film, and deserves the highest respect. I do not want to say anything that may offend anyone. With a film like this you have to be careful how you phrase things.Overall, a great film, strong performances, intelligent script and a real eye opener to anyone who watches it.

300,Jsimpson5,One of the best movies of all time,9,22 December 2006,"This may contain spoilers! I saw this film for the first time about 6 years ago when I was at the beach with my family. My cousin decided to rent the film, and told me that he watched it when he was in drug rehab. The movie is about a neo Nazi Derek Vinyard(Norton) who goes to jail for killing two African American men outside his house. He younger brother Danny Vinyard (Furlong) saw this, but did not testify, saving his brother from a life sentence. Derek gets out of jail 3 years later when his sentence is up, and finds out that his younger brother is on the same path of destruction. Derek tells Danny about changing his ways, and explains to what happened to him in jail in hopes that Danny does not go to jail either.This is a very powerful movie that is central theme is about anti-racism. The plot is a fairly generic one, someone telling someone close to them to change their ways so that they do not follow a similar fate.The acting is well done for all of the characters and you can see the emotion that Edward Norton has the end of the movie. The movie also has a unique way of tell the story. For any evens that have occurs in the past, black and white film is used, and when it's for the present color film is used. This film is NOT for everyone. If you are offended by racial slurs, acts of violence and hate against minorities, strong profanity (mainly the F word), rape, and or nudity, then do NOT watch this film. This film has all I have listed in the previous sentence in it, and then some. This is the one of the best films that I have ever seen, and I don't think any of the films that were made in the last 6 years even come close to the greatness this film has.So if you are not offended by any of the stuff I have listed above, then buy this film and watch it.

301,ntvnyr30,Powerful film,8,28 July 2007,"This is a very effective movie, which for me is gauged by how many times my stomach turned during this film. Edward Norton gives the performance of a lifetime, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar.The topic of race relations in America is a touchy subject, and this film thankfully didn't portray one side--i.e. the whites--as being the problem. There are many black ""leaders"" who fallaciously allege that blacks cannot be racist because they haven't any power. This allegation is ridiculous: the fact that Tawana Brawley was never prosecuted for her fiasco is an excellent example of which side has the power. The worst thing that you can be labeled these days? A Communist--no. A Fascist--no. The worst thing you can be labeled these days is a ""racist."" That's why many whites are reluctant to speak on race relations, it's the 3rd rail of politics.No one probably wants to admit it, but Norton's character makes a lot of sense when discussing the illegal immigration problem and the Rodney King debacle. I had heard a stat from the FBI not too long ago that was eye-opening: that black men, who are 6% of the American population, commit 45% of the violent crimes in this country--that's unbelievable!! Further, you have people that practically swim to this country from Asia, learn the language, and still outperform blacks in school, and yet all we hear are excuses from the black ""leaders."" The vision of a Southern governor of the 50's standing outside a school to prevent black children from entering is a distant memory. Now you have schools practically begging black students to apply to college, despite their poor qualifications, in order to promote ""diversity"" while Asian kids, for example, work their butts off and get cheated as colleges admit the less qualified applicants. So much for fairness and the American dream. And yet, these policies by liberal do-gooders promote more friction among ethnic groups. Unfortunately, however, a white man like myself is not supposed to brooch these issues--for only someone like Bill Cosby can, and he has, to his credit. Despite my rants above, I don't believe in the radicalism of these white supremacist groups. This nation would undoubtedly be more harmonious if there were no more ""protected minorities"" and that all quota systems would cease. People should advance based on merit, not by skin color. After all, isn't that what Martin Luther King Jr said?",American History X

The plot is excellent, the message loud and clear, the performances stunning, and the ending heartbreaking. To think that Edward Norton didn't win best actor surprises me to say the least. Roberto Benigni must have given one HELL of a performance if it was better than Edward Norton's.One of the things that makes this movie so remarkable is Derek's transformation from cold-blooded, bigoted, ruthless neo-nazi to moral, upstanding citizen. Much of the movie (the black and white part) focuses on Derek's life before and during prison. He goes to any and all lengths to prevent his brother Danny from going down the same wrong path. From an act Danny does early on in the movie, he pays the ultimate price at the end.To think that American History X wasn't even nominated for best picture is really, not just shocking, but strange too. Strange that movies like this are overlooked all too often these days.",American History X
307,critic-22,One of the most powerful movies/drama ever made - but flaws remain,8,27 April 1999,"American History X has got a combination of great script writing and acting which when combined bring out an incredible drama that proves that anyone can be manipulated into certain ideas and dogmas. When Edward Norton talks from the racist view point there seems to be some truth to what he is saying. This is what makes him really dangerous as he inspires others to have the same attitude towards other people.There were a number of faults in this movie that prevented it from classic status, but it is worth seeing it for the qualities I have already mentioned. 1) At the start of the movie I felt that Norton was somewhat justified to harm and get angry about two black youths stealing from him. He was protecting HIS property, this scene could and should have been different if the movie was trying to convey that violence is wrong and unjustified. 2) The prison scene did not convince me that Norton had converted to a different way of thinking. The prison scene was a great opportunity for character development of both Norton and the other inmates that influenced him. This movie failed in this department which as it turns out was fundamental to the whole story. 3) The ending scene it can mean violence leads to more violence is a cliche I have heard in thousands of other movies including Boyz in the Hood. The movie was much more than a black and white issues as another alternative view of the movie's ending could imply. The movie was not simply about hatred, rather emancipating a person through understanding another person's point of view. Yet the movie ended in cliche and violence. This is not totally a bad thing as it would move some people to think about their actions and consequences, but fails to push the debate along from what other related movies have achieved. Tough not as good or clever as Life is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella), both deal with hatred and intolerance and are well both worth seeing for the acting and script alone.

Don't get me wrong - it's OK - infact it's a good attempt at a serious docu-drama by Hollywood - it's just that Europe does this sort of thing much better. And the UK (esp. the BBC and C4) has made much better films on neo-Nazis. The film is also a little sentimental and hard to swallow in parts (the rapid transformation of the brother from normal boy to Nazi back to normal boy again was hard to believe). On the positive side, Edward Norton is excellent and the movie is never boring. Maybe I'm spoiled having seen Norton in 'Fight Club' recently. Now that *was* a great movie...",American History X

In the end, Norton's character just isn't believable at all. But what makes it even more flaws is the grand finale, which was disappointing, rushed and forced. It was as if the writers had once again said ""we need to inject academy award winning ending."" And how unfortunate that it just was entirely ridiculous after all that time.

Few people encounter such overt racism in their everyday lives, and this film serves as an important reminder about the dangers of such beliefs.  In the past 5-10 years, America pulled itself out of its ""PC"" era which means anti-racist thinking is on the way out, only to be replaced by something more honest and instinctual (much better in my opinion).  When's the last time you heard the word ""prejudice?""  I never thought that would be a buzzword, but it is.American History X serves to remind us of the pockets of anachronistic racism still living in the U.S.  How prevalent these beliefs used to be still amazes me, and film exhibits no exception.  Check out Spike Lee's Bamboozled for a shocking glimpse into that.  I'll also take this opportunity to say again how much I hate Gone With the Wind... a classic joke of overacting (not Gable) and inadvertent racism that I couldn't get past.  Films with double purpose of education and entertainment are few and far between.  Chalk another one up for Norton, this one's a keeper.  Prepare to be shocked. 10/10",American History X

314,Pierre_D,Uneven film with a strong message on racism.,7,11 June 2012,"American History X is a star-studded film whose message about racism hits you at a visceral level, but ultimately seems like an after school television special with its characterizations.We're in California a few years after the Rodney King riots and incidents. Ed Norton is Derek Vinyard, a tough-talking skinhead and his brother Danny is getting drowned in the maelstrom of hate. Derek's room has posters of Hitler and other white supremacist tokens and he has a swastika tattooed across his back; he's crossed that line and there is no coming back, or so we think...Sadly uneven, American History X could have been much more. Blacks in the picture are shown as either neutral (playing basketball and hanging out) or criminal or almost subservient. It isn't until Derek is in jail that we say an African American with depth and by that time we would really have liked another one with depth. The prison scenes are some of the best in the movie, with Derek being violated after he didn't pay for protection and his isolation from the other white supremacists finally does him in.Derek finds redemption in prison and tries to save Danny from the jaws of fellow skinheads but it all unravels for the family when he breaks up with his girlfriend, tells off Stacy Keach (the skinhead leader) and pulls Danny out, not a minute too soon. Seeing them tear down their propaganda and turn over a new leaf is as uplifting as Danny's murder at the end is disheartening. In the end, American History X teaches us that violence begets violence and that while you can change yourself you may never be able to change your environment.Sadly, the movie could used another half hour or so to show the other side of the coin, a side that was never explored until the prison scenes.",American History X

319,puttputtk,"moving, sad, gritty, powerful and beautiful.",10,26 June 2010,"American History X (1998)5 word summaryFormer Neo-Nazi tries saving brother American History X is a fantastic story of a ex Neo-Nazi skinhead who has changed his ways and is now trying to stop his brother from going down the same path that he went, which ended with him in prison. There is a large list of things that made this film so great. To start off the directing and editing. Showing the past when Derek was a skinhead as black and white, and the present as color, was a great idea. Not doing that would have been fine but since they did it, it really added a sense of darkness. It's the way he wants his life and his country, colorless, and it feels more depressing. All the acting was great, Edward Furlong, Ethan Suplee, Elliot Gould, everyone really gave believable and some of their best performances. I didn't add Edward Norton in that group because he deserves extra attention for his role. Its amazing. The way he gives his lines, his body language, his facial expressions, everything is remarkable. The scene in which he kills the man for breaking into his car for instance, the look on his face is terrifying, so much pride and anger and accomplishment all shown in that one look as the cops show up. There are scenes with him as a skinhead talking about how bad immigrants, jews and blacks are and you just believe that's how Edward Norton feels, cause he just sells it so well its hard to believe hes acting. Then, he gets out of prison and his thoughts have changed and again you believe everything he says. Personally I think the scene that he shines the most in is when he's yelling at his old friend Cameron at his party, telling him to stay away from him and his brother, that scene alone makes me wonder how he didn't win the Oscar that year.American History X is such an important film. In a time when many feel racism isn't as much of an issue anymore this film shows that it is still real and shows the terror that it can bring. Although I doubt any extreme racists have seen this film and changed their way, it seems like it should. Derek learns the errors of his way, and we see it happen. We see how terrible white people and black people can be, but we see how good they can be too. It shows how racism is just ignorance and stubbornness, not knowing about other races and not wanting to. Derek never really knew any black people, he just thought he did, when he finally starts talking to Lamont (the black man he works with in prison) he sees he's his only friend in that prison, not the other Nazis but a man who, before then, he would have wanted dead. American History X is one of my all time favorite films and I think most people would agree that its one of the best. Its drama at its best; moving, sad, gritty, powerful and beautiful.

320,HardKnockLife210,Controversy Doesn't Always Equal Great Film-Making,6,5 February 2005,"Controversial subjects usually make for interesting movies, and American History X courts controversy in so many ways by examining neo-Nazis, racism, prison violence, and school violence all in the same movie. So American History X is a very interesting film, but it is executed so haphazardly that it becomes hard to enjoy, and it loses most of its potential and some of its power in the process.The film examines the life and crimes of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) through the eyes of his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), both whom are ""involved"" in the neo-nazi movement. In exactly what ways they are (and were) involved are examined in the film, much of which is told through flashbacks. It is evident that these two boys have forced much hardship upon their families, evident in the performance of Beverly D'Angelo as the boys' mother. However, the performances of both Norton and Furlong, although adequate, are short of spectacular.Much of the action of the film is shot in pain-staking slow motion, making everything so over-dramatic that it's almost laughable. McKenna's screenplay is indeed interesting at points, but some of it too gets caught up on formulaic statements and unneeded dialogue. Many of the scenes seem unneeded and seem to need replacement by scenes that give more insight into Danny's mindset. Instead of these scenes, though, the viewer is left with a character who seems somewhat one-dimensional.Even with the slow motion, Kaye's direction and cinematography are unique enough to grab the viewer's attention, even when it does distract from the rest of the film. Also, the film is thought-provoking in its examination of racial matters, especially as we see through the eyes of characters so prejudiced. Further questioning and thought is provoked by the movie's ending, which is both beautiful and shocking in such an odd way that it almost makes the whole film worthwhile.It is obvious that this film is unashamed to say what it wants to say. Yet it's still a shame that American History X was not caught on film as something more powerful and profound in its display.Final Grade: B-.",American History X
321,T-10,"graphic, powerful, compelling, and thought provoking",10,27 November 1998,"In the age of three hour movies I wish this had been.  In the just two hours the film did not develop some of its most im- portant story lines.  I wanted to see more development of Derek's move away from Neo- Nazi ideals and Danny's move towards. This may have served to give more meaning to the final scenes and made them seem less contrived and routine.  It may seem I did not like this film, but, in fact, I wanted to see more--more character develop ment, more dialogue between the main char- acters, more transitional scenes--just more!  On the positive side this is probably the most important movie of the year and is a ""must see"".  I particularly liked the cinematography.  The black and white flashbacks and the great number of close-up face shots were great.  They set the mood for the film as both dark and intense. The honest presentation of political and social problems that face the country in the late 20th Century is laudable.  Mr. Norton portrays a convincing, sometimes loathsome but sometimes very human even likable skinhead.  His journey to and from these ideals and the relationship with his younger brother, Mr. Furlong, make this a most compelling story.  Mr. Norton's performance is worthy of best actor consideration in his successful portrayal of this complex character.  I would emphasize that this film is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it is brutally (in all senses of the word) honest, and if you don't leave the theater thinking and/or talking then I suggest a brain scan.  Once again thanks to Mr. Norton for an outstanding performance.  Four stars for his performance and the topic even though it could have used a more (see above)",American History X
322,plpregent,Interesting subject matter oddly matched with pompous commercial-like visuals ; wonderful cast stuck in shallow characters with oversimplified psychology.,6,24 July 2019,"I was in my mid-teenage years when I first watched ""American History X"", and certainly thought it was quite a striking motion picture, both in its message and in its depiction of violence. I recently watched it again, and I'm not sure whether it did not age well at all, or whether my maturity as a viewer allowed me to put pure emotion aside and to lift the veil on fundamental issues with this film that are just very difficult to ignore.Over twenty years later, I can definitely say that this film speaks volumes about numerous worrisome truths that are still plaguing American society today. However, I have to say that the delivery feels visually pompous and narratively pretty shallow, if not sometimes incoherent as far as character psychology is concerned.We follow the story of a teenager named Daniel Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong), whose older brother, a skinhead named Derek (played by Edward Norton) is being released from prison, after spending over three years behind the bars for brutally murdering two black gang members. Through a narrative structure that includes numerous flashbacks, we get to see what led Derek to become a leader among a white supremacist gang and commit such a hateful crime. We also get to see how easily influenced Daniel is, trying to follow the same path as his older brother. Derek comes back home as a totally changed man, and as an older brother that feels the urgency to prevent his younger sibling from falling into the same spiral of hate and violence that ultimately ruined his life.It is a well-known story that the director, Tony Kaye, didn't want his name associated to this film even before its release, due to his disapproval of the final cut, which apparently involves a tone that differs significantly from what he initially had in mind. I have no idea what Kaye's cut of this film was like, and perhaps we will never know, but one thing I can say is this: despite a relevant message altogether, I found that both the characters' psychology and the moral issues that it explores are oversimplified and tackled in a frustratingly superficial way. Some of the dialogue is clumsy and sometimes unnecessary. The best example: Derek didn't need to say ""What did I do"" when holding the bloodied up body of his young brother who just got shot. Also, Derek's transition from being a young man filled with rage and hatred to becoming a completely changed man is quite abrupt and feels very unnatural, and so does Daniel's sudden ""change of mind"", which occurs within the span of barely a couple of minutes, technically. Right after that conversation, they added a quick shot of both brothers running around the deserted street, poking fun at each other right after, just to show that Daniel's moment of clarity paid off. Oh boy. Tried to keep my palm away from my face, but couldn't.This makes me wonder how badly the film's flaws are due to poor editing choices, and certain parts being left out of the cut that ended up getting released. We will never know, unfortunately.At the time, Tony Kaye's background as a director was mostly within the world of advertising, which I thought was apparent in a few scenes. On the other hand, other scenes almost felt like they were from a TV movie, which left an overall impression that the direction was uneven. The use of black and white during flashbacks, albeit arguably clichéd, was an artistic choice that paid off visually, as those scenes do look great. That being said, this highly stylized violence left me with mixed feelings, as it certainly contradicts the film's whole point. On that same note, I don't know if the use of slow motion was a result of New Line and Norton's input that ultimately led to the cut that Kaye disowned, but at times it seriously felt conspicuous.The film's main appeal lies in Edward Norton's performance, which is intense and excellent. Again, some of the dialogue, in my view, is not on point at all, and contributes to blemish the character, along with the scattered, untidy psychological evolution that he goes through. That being said, every time Norton appears on screen, he does phenomenal work. Other notable performances include those of Edward Furlong, Faizura Balk and Beverly D'Angelo, unfortunately playing characters that lack any trace of a nuance whatsoever.I know how beloved this film is, and I know that this review will probably be very unpopular. I'm not arguing that ""American History X"" does not have a strong and important message, or some really touching moments. Not at all. However, such an important subject matter deserved a more in-depth and thorough look at the psychological evolution of the film's two main characters, because polished visuals and a few tear-inducing moments enhanced with dramatic music and sequences in slow motion are no substitute for that in a film that tackles issues of this magnitude. I find its IMDb score of 8.5 to be quite puzzling, to be absolutely honest.A longer portion of the film's runtime is spent on showing physical and psychological violence in an ostentatious manner than on exploring the mechanisms through which hatred and violence is conveyed within a group of individuals - or a family. And that is a problem.Despite having both the best of intentions and ambition, ""American History X"" is quite a flawed film that shares traits with most melodramatic TV movies: it takes the easy preachy route and uses psychological shortcuts aplenty rather than thoroughly exploring the social issues that are at its core.",American History X

In jail he is forced to meet and be acquainted with minorities he hated too much to know. when he's released, he comes home to find that his younger brother his headed to the same fate as his and tries to stop him. now, this basic subject has been executed to motion pictures in all kinds of versions such as Rob Reiner's ghosts from the past but unlike that movie (which is pathetic, if i may say so) this movie tries to deal with the basic cause of racism instead of merely explaining it by the nature of southern yahoos that usually have the I.Q. of algea (according to reiner et al) finally, I would like to salute Edward norton who, if not tempted to play in mediocre hollywood films, is bound to be the next Al Pacino (i didn't say De-niro because he deteriorated so badly that i can't even talk about it). summing up: rent the movie justify your movie freakiness or at least remind yourself why you became one in the first place.",American History X

327,Brad K.,Edward Norton and American History X will leave you breathless.,9,2 May 1999,"American History X is one of those rare films that once it's over will make you sit silently for a few minutes not moving.  American History X is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  Edward Norton (Primal Fear, Rounders) stars as a recently released prisoner (for the brutal murder of 2 black men) who has recently given up being a Neo-Nazi.  When he comes back from prison he finds that his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong (Terminator 2, Little Oddessa) has followed him down the same path as a Neo-Nazi.  Norton with the help of Furlong's teacher, well-played by Avery Brooks (TV's Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, The Big Hit), tries to get Furlong out of that lifestyle.  The film deals with many flashbacks showing how Norton got where he is now in the film.  The film is disturbing at times, but always compelling and very powerful.  Norton is incredible in the lead role, deserving the Oscar nomination he received.  Furlong is great also, in a difficult role.  Fine support work is turned in by Guy Torry (Life, Ride) as a black man in prison who helps turn Norton around, and Beverly D'Angelo (Vegas Vacation, Lightning Jack) as Norton and Furlong's caring mother. Highly recommended.",American History X
328,vbz,"weak directorially, strong performances nevertheless",6,21 January 2000,"The scandal of Tony Kaye disowning his work and condemning New Line who took it away before he could realize his 90-minute cut is well publicized by now. And it's no surprise why the director became so enraged: American History X is definitely in need of major editing. In it's two hour theatrical version, this study of California skinheads seems haphazard and even amateurish at times. The studio's attempt to improve the film actually made it much worse:the picture looks like an effort by an ambitious, self-indulgent high school student assisted by his far less inspired teacher. Most of the black-and-white sequences (flashbacks of Norton's and Furlong's life as skinhead brothers) are much more powerful and beautifully shot than the trite and cheaply melodramatic color scenes set in the present day. One cannot help but contemplate this film's potential on all levels of production: for one, it should have used a more urgent and appropriate soundtrack of modern hip-hop and hardcore instead of the typical Hollywood solution to all dramas which we've all heard literally hundreds of times; and also cut down on the slow motion, arguably the most gratuitous since The Postman. Still, Norton's extraordinary performance and several thought-provoking scenes make one wonder what the movie could have been if Kaye was allowed to perfect his material without intervention.",American History X

Edward Furlong seems to spend the entire movie looking meaningfully at what's going on around him. I found parts of the plot a bit unbelievable.  Specifically, Edward Norton was redeemed by a friendly black laundry worker who was able to amuse with comic routines.  This black laundry worker appeared to have no knowledge of Edward Norton's vicious crimes, yet was able to hold back an entire prison group from murdering Edward. I usually like Stacy Keach but found his role depicted him as a buffoon. His character was highly intelligent with great organizational skills -- why was it hidden? Beverly D'Angelo gave a wonderful performance as the mother.  She is an actress with a wide range and q;uite believably pulls off her role as the mother (and widow) of a family who racially hates.",American History X
330,Kalle_it,How to ruin a good movie,7,30 November 2009,"Why can't we have good things?Easy: because every Hollywood movie MUST be, or become, preachy and cheesy at one point or another...AHX had potential, and lots of it. Edward Norton once again delivers a great performance, and the whole cast is above average too.The story, as it unfolds, is interesting and intriguing. Even the somewhat stereotyped ""nazis"" work quite well in the general flow of the movie. All in all the story holds up quite well until Derek comes home from jail.There it is: our turning point: the movie quickly becomes painfully predictable: thanks to a rape in the showers, to a clichéd ""friendly African-American inmate unjustly convicted"" and to his old professor's (African-American himself too...) Derek suddenly sees the light and turns his back to his old friends and ideals.Of course Derek's redemption has a huge influence on his younger brother Danny, but sadly his fate is written already...Essentially American History X is a movie of two halves: the first part is enjoyable and outstanding, despite some predictable twists. The second part is preachy and even more predictable, so the redemption-through-death ending doesn't come as a surprise, but more like as a consequence.To be honest, the whole movie is filled with clichés and stereotypes: Derek's dad is the typical narrow-minded WASP, the White Power guys are complete morons with zero depth (which might be realistic, but come on... show some imagination). The positive characters are African-American, and of course we can't go without the token Jewish character and the liberal one getting unfairly abused.Even disregarding that aspect, Derek seems to joins and leaves the White Power crusade too abruptly and with little-to-none inner labour.THAT, much more than the cheesy and predictable twists, is the most disappointing aspect of a movie which could and should have been more complex.But, as said, the movie industry is manichean: things are either good or bad, black or white. Layers of grey aren't welcome.",American History X
331,Wwmbrd,Powerful,8,20 September 2021,"A powerful message that neither glorifies racism, it's effects, or countereffects of the disease it symtomizes. I was most impressed by director Kaye's ability to entice the audience to sympathize with a violent, hateful protagonist in some tender moments of familial love, and yet revile his deeds by portraying them in their most brutal, realistic light. Derek Vinyard is not a good man, but under the intolerance and hate is a wound that is not dissimilar to the persons of color he victimized. I was also appreciative of how Kaye also doesn't portray any one group as purely a victim, in what could have easily been a (more) racially charged and motivated film than it was. It doesn't glorify gang activity, white supremacy, prison life, or racial struggles in any way, but instead paints a visceral picture of the multifaceted reality that it represents; a microcosm of real life... That nothing is fair, and it's how we choose to address the challenges we're presented. Hate never made anyone's life better.",American History X

The black&white/color aspect was interesting.  It both served as a divider between the past and the present, but I believe it also served as a metaphor for the closed mind Derek had in the black and white footage and the enlightened mind he had in the color footage.  Pretty deep, huh? Definitely left an impact.",American History X
333,kylopod,"Highly compelling, but not entirely convincing",7,13 March 2006,"The concept of a reformed neo-Nazi is so intriguing that it's a wonder there haven't been more movies on this topic. Once you see ""American History X,"" however, you will understand why. The movie's racial themes are provocative and unsettling, far outside the comfort zone of the average viewer, and the movie additionally has the challenging task of explaining how a violent criminal changed his ways. Does the movie convincingly explain that transition? Not entirely.It's an engrossing movie, nonetheless. It uses a device more common in literature than in the movies: inter-cutting between several story-lines. First we see Derek (Ed Norton) as a free man, newly released from prison, and having developed a conscience. Then we see earlier points in his life when he was a white supremacist, and finally the prison experience that changed him. The non-chronological approach is very effective, making the movie about as engaging as any thriller, even though the plot itself offers few surprises. Had the film followed a more conventional timeline, we'd have quickly grown impatient waiting for plot developments that were inevitable. With the way it's structured, our focus is on the process more than the outcome: How did a bright kid like Derek become a racist? And what turned him around?The movie takes great pains to show how articulate the younger Derek is when he justifies his hatred of blacks by citing the statistics of black crime. (His more personal motive is that blacks murdered his father.) His arguments hit upon common politically conservative themes as he finds fault with affirmative action, glorification of criminals like Rodney King, and liberals who blame (white) society for the problems facing blacks. But Derek takes this reasoning a step further and argues that blacks have a ""racial commitment to crime."" Of course, by taking that step, he undermines his own arguments. For example, how does his harping about ""personal responsibility"" square with his belief in judging people for factors beyond their control, like their race? Responsibility requires choice. If race were the reason for black crime, then black criminals would be morally blameless. But no character points out such contradictions in Derek's views. When he debates a liberal teacher played by Elliot Gould, the gentle Gould character acts like a milquetoast, unable to provide a strong rebuttal. It's a powerful scene, and more than plausible: as in real life, people aren't always prepared with eloquent answers, even when confronted by someone with indefensible views.Still, it's disconcerting that the film never fully addresses the ""intellectual"" side of his bigotry. The main impetus for Derek's change is internal: once he learns to respect himself, he starts respecting others--a nice thought, no doubt, but I'm not sure it would be a strong enough fulcrum for change in this character's racial views. Although some would assume that Derek is too intelligent to remain racist, I would assume he's too intelligent not to come up with yet more rationalizations.There are other factors at work, too, including his treatment by white inmates and his befriending of a charming black inmate (Guy Torry). But all this seems to provide, at most, an emotional response to the earlier scenes. The movie made me realize how much the public attitude toward race has changed since the late 1960s, when optimistic films like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" confronted racism by creating immensely likable African-American characters and ignoring any other social and cultural tensions that might pose a barrier to interracial relationships. In AHX, almost all the black characters are gang members and criminals, and there seems to be an underlying cynicism in the film's reluctance to provide a clear-cut refutation to Derek's right-wing arguments. Implicitly, the movie argues that there's a cycle of hatred going on between white and black gangs, and that the white racists aren't solely to blame for this situation. Aside from his relationship with Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and his prison friend, the basis for Derek's turnaround is largely negative: he realizes that he's no better than the black outlaws he so despises. That isn't exactly the most inspiring message about race relations.My main reason for wanting to watch this movie in the first place was to understand better how an extremist hatemonger could change. But that turns out to be the least convincing aspect of the film. The root of the problem probably lies in the conception. The filmmakers started with the intelligent skinhead character, then they thought, ""What sorts of events will lead this character to transform?"" That's why the conclusion feels just a tad contrived. It's a good film, overall, but ironically where it's weak is in the very area that makes the story the most interesting.",American History X

341,judemcrobbie,How politics in a movie should be done-A must watch!,10,16 February 2021,"This movie is heavily centred on race. The conflict between black and white mainly, hence the B&W. This creative choice not only compounds the narrative of the flashbacks, how the protagonist sees the clear divide between black and white, but also the idea to see the difference between the new ideas of the new moments.
There are some truly mortifying scenes that if I were to say could ruin the movie. I really do not recommend watching this unless you are at least a mature 15.
For a movie so centred on race, it's so well done. It is more of a teaching experience, letting the idea grow in your mind. This is better done than most movies on touchy films as they do not really give you the ability to think, shoving it all into your face not letting you think about right and wrong for yourself. This movie so powerful for this exact reason. Especially how main protagonist is someone, as a society, we are meant to hate. Despite this, the movie is through the eyes of the adoring younger brother, so he is presented as a good character for the majority of the time.
The humour in this movie is so well placed but also incredibly funny. It's usually used to make us enjoy, or like a Lamont (Guy Torry) is made to see the changes in ideals through the movie, especially for the protagonist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton). Lamont's personality represents that of the good of humanity, juxtaposed to him in jail. This shows no one is truly good of heart.
Edward Norton is astonishingly brilliant in this role. Yes the acting in the flashback is unbelievably good, but he time after he's out of jail is for me what makes it the best. The little details are what makes this role some of the best ever. For example, when he hears racist words (A word he has previously uttered personally) he grimaces and turns away.
The speeches are beautifully written with some of the most powerful dialogue ever written, but it truly comes from Norton's delivery.
This movie is just incredible. It will stick with me forever. It has truly enlightened me to bigger issues in this world and the other side of the argument. It has helped me to not understand nor empathise with the other side, but see the opposite side.
This is not a movie for the week of mid nor of heart, but it is truly one anyone should watch in such political times.",American History X

I saw it twice to ""correct"" the impressions I had the first time I watched it, but still make me consider this movie good but not convincing.The perfect script makes the dialogs fluid and entertaining, but also rich in the contents. Political debates seem real, as the director would deliver to us the ""gross weight"" of the words, confiding we'd make the right ""tare"" with our conscience. The boy Danny had a role I loved. He's probably the best actor in the movie, showing a teen-ager under the influences of a brother and mother with opposite minds, but (thanks to his age) both equally beloved, beyond political visions.Derek's redemption is badly portrayed. There is not a single reason because he should change his life INSIDE the fascist club, unchaining brawls and wounding the boss. The ""conversion"" of his brother on the stands is too quick and widely unrealistic. Also, performances by Brooks and Suplee are really really bad.The 2 hours go away rapidly when you like meaningful stories, but the shocking ending doesn't get a gram of relief. Probably it's a movie crafted for an American audience and something was lost in translation. Anyway, a minute after you've entirely watched it, an earthquake of thoughts invades your mind, with a unusual yearning to share and measure your own points of view with the others'. That's the best quality of American History X, inviting to take courage and sides on an argument, immigration and tolerance, concerning every single First World nation.Vote: 23/30",American History X
344,DylansFearFiles,Produces A Good Message,7,23 February 2009,"I am a big fan of Edward Norton and something of a gangland researcher. I expected something of a ""gangster"" film as well as drama. Instead I got a drama, an anti-racism drama, that produces a well tailored argument.Racism is seen as one of the greatest United States problems. The issue dates back thousands of years. I think it is wrong, but that opinion is unable to be proved. Many people have fought for civil rights, such as President Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..Derick Vineyard (Edward Norton) was seduced into the world of Neo-Nazi skinheads as a teenager. His father was shot down in a black neighborhood while fighting a fire on a drug den. This tragic incident thrown him into a large amount of anger and also created a grudge with other races. Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) recruits him and uses his charisma and intelligence to brainwash other frustrated kids into the group. At the end of Derick's career as a skinhead, he brutally killed two African-Americans that try to steal his car and is imprisoned for three years. When he comes out, he is completely rehabilitated but his brother, Daniel (Edward Furlong) is going down the same path. Derick decides that he must stop his brother from going down that path before it is too late.Norton deserved his Oscar nomination for this film. There is no question about it. I have probably never seen a movie that produces such a good argument about the topic. It really shows the effects that racism has on a family.All of the acting is good. The supporting cast was solid. Avery Brooks and Beverly D'Angelo both did a great job.This movie made me see how bad racism is. I am not or was not a racist to start with but still shows you what the problems and causes are. I hope you, the viewer, see it the same way.",American History X
345,Norway1,One of the extremely few moral installments in recent Hollywood history.,9,24 August 1999,"This was a movie receiving much controversy here in Europe and possibly in the US as well.I watched it mainly because I love Edward Norton as an actor - especially in Primal Fear! - and knew he would be exceptional in his role, though I knew very little about the story's plot.Edward Furlong is an incredible aspiring young actor (born in August, 1977 - he was 20 while filming this yet appears to be much younger, I think).I must say I was impressed beyond words by this films boldness and ability to stand forth with it's message.What is it's message?It teaches us that things aren't always what we're brought up to believe - Not always to believe the hype and circumstance that the paraphernalia around us so vividly offers. That we can make a difference in this world. That we are in complete control of our lives and can change the direction our life is going if we have the guts and tenacity.Mainly, I guess, I loved that Derek Vinyard saw the errors in his (and his brother Danny's) direction and was responsible enough to do something to change it. That he cared enough for his brother to lovingly help him to completely change the way he thought and, as a roll-model in Danny's life, to show him the example necessary to turn him around.I usually don't like movies with excessive violence and especially foul language, but in this case I think they were both necessary to show the extremely hateful world the white-supremests live in. I think it made it's point well. (Just be sure not to allow younger children near the screen while watching this. It definitely deserves it's 18+ (R) rating.)Though not without flaws I believe this movie to be one of the greater moral additions to Hollywood's disturbingly bland and irresponsible canon.",American History X
346,shamsee,Good Movie,8,24 August 2000,"I will give this movie an 8/10. It did a good job of tackling and explaining tough issues. It also showed how little incidents just become excuse for venting built up anger. It also showed the power of love, especially power of mother's love, love between two brothers, and love of a teacher to rescue students, perfectly. Mother's character and the scene where the argument turns into a fight was just too powerful. When mother is shown battling poverty as  well by sacrificing comfort for her kids, it moved me to tears. Also it shows that sometimes one good person, like the black guy in prison who becomes a friend to the main character, his niceness and attitude changed that man's life and saved him. Just imagine if that character had his own problems and rage then what would have happened. It also showed how foolish and shallow people associated with hate-groups really are and how it is an expression of their other problems.Despite all those power, moving, and terrifying moments, the liberal director and writers missed the point of their own movie. The movie that is supposed to be warning to those who hate and is supposed to show power of love and ability to overcome rage, and as a matter of facts wants to be a guide for people struggling with those issues, itself engages in demonization and unfair characterization, which will hurt the feelings of those who are being labeled and cause a rage to built up in them, a result opposite of what this movie should have and hopes to have.Is it really fair to describe opposition to Affirmative Action as a first step towards becoming a skin-head? That's what movie seems to be suggesting. Good people can agree on the issue and on ideas how to help those who need help but demonization of the extremely large portion of the population is hardly useful. Also the skin head is shown to use the words 'Democrat' and 'Liberal' as curse words. Yeah, that's fair, and that should really bring people together. It is sad that those who made the movie about overcoming anger and rage could not control their own negative feelings and had to demonize innocent people.In any case see this movie, if for nothing else, to see a mother's love and sacrifice.",American History X

350,sublime501,"Amazing, upon first glance.",8,25 July 2004,"AMERICAN HISTORY X is the powerful story of a proud skinhead named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who gets sent to jail for 3+ years after murdering a couple of young black men who invade his property. When he gets out, a reformed man, he finds that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his old footsteps--and even turned in a school paper entitled, ""My Mein Kampf."" Danny's school principal, Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), tells him to rewrite this paper and instead focus it on his own brother. After Derek attempts to flee from his old skinhead gang, and embarrasses Danny in the process, he tells Danny of the story that led him into jail, and what happened once he was there... which Danny then puts into his paper, in the process known as passing it on.AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of those movies that, upon first glance, is really amazing; but upon repeated viewings, it becomes easier and easier to notice its glaring flaws. The main flaw here is the script. It is awfully written, although there are several humorous moments and also several powerful ones (probably due to great acting and direction, though). Truly, the only interesting parts of the movie are the ones telling of Derek's past (filmed in black and white for an interesting contrast)--the current events, filmed in color, are rather boring and are most specifically when the terrible script shines through. And, though it's a pretty unrealistic movie for the most part, it's made up for.Then there are the aspects of the movie that you can't really win or lose with. The acting is the most obvious of this category. Edward Norton is GREAT in his starring role (and, kind of oddly considering he plays a skinhead jerk for most of the movie, very attractive), and really holds the movie together. Edward Furlong is also great, though he receives the brunt of the bad lines in my opinion. Among the supporting cast, Fairuza Balk is good as Derek's girlfriend Stacey; Ethan Suplee is good as Derek and Danny's friend Seth; Jennifer Lien is great as Derek and Danny's sister Davina; and Guy Torry is also great as Derek's fellow inmate Lamont. However, the rest of the cast is pretty bad. Beverly D'Angelo stands out in particular as Derek and Danny's mother Doris, as does Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. The former is very melodramatic and has awful delivery, while the latter is completely monotonous and expressionless. Elliott Gould (as the mother's boyfriend Murray) has bad vocal delivery, but he also appears in one of the most heart-breaking scenes in the film.There are some very good and powerful moments, though, which can all be credited to Edward Norton's marvelous acting. The dinner scene is very sad and unnerving, while the smiley/arrest scene is almost unbearable to watch because it's so horrific and well-done. Even the second time that I watched the film, and I knew what was coming, I found myself cringing when Derek orders the burglar to put his mouth on the curb. The prison scenes are pretty unnecessary and badly carried out, however. And the ending totally shocked me--I could feel my jaw drop and stay there until the credits rolled.After first viewing, I was ready to give AMERICAN HISTORY X a 9. After my second viewing, though, I was less impressed (maybe because I wasn't so shocked and amazed by the disturbing and distressing ending), and was ready to give it only a 7. The average of those two: 8/10.",American History X

He leaves the penitentiary with radically different ideas and is determined to put his past racism behind him and to move on. That, though, proves to be not an easy task. And, while Derek was in prison, his younger brother Danny (Furlong), who was also a racist skinhead, was on the horns of a dilemma. He found himself torn between an attachment to the ideas of his black high-school principal and those of a local neo-nazi leader. ""American History X"" is a very good film. The difficulties that Derek faces in trying to turn his life around and those experienced by his brother in deciding whether to hunt with the pack (the neo-Nazis) or to plough his own more responsible furrow are very effectively portrayed. The film contains a number of very powerful scenes, not least the one in which Derek kills one of the car thieves. Despite its horrific nature, it is not gratuitous. What prevents the film from being a great one is that there is an element of preachiness about it. In addition, some of the characters' motivation is rather too simplistic. The film asks us to believe that Derek's racism sprang largely from a homily delivered during a family meal by his father about the evil of positive discrimination on behalf of black people. (Admittedly, the circumstances of his father's death also proved to be a factor.) And I was not convinced that Derek's friendship with a black prisoner and the influence that the latter had on him would have resulted in his reforming his ideas in quite the easy way in which the film suggests. Despite those weaknesses, ""American History X"" is a very good film that is well worth watching. 8/10.",American History X
357,panchodh_12,An intense critique of where can intrasocietal tension take us,8,20 October 2014,"This is a very shocking movie. The story is very good and the actors perform it greatly. But what really shocks you is the idea that it is an entirely feasible situation; that the ideas the characters express in the movies is also expressed by real people in real life situations. Although this movie revolves around Neo-Nazis, it does reflect upon tensions within society as a whole. It's not only about skinheads and their crazy WW2 ideologies, it's in general about the misconception of delimiting ""us"" and ""them"", about failing to see how human all of us are, and instead turning to the humanness of ""my"" group, and the lack of humanity of everyone else. It is about the very human attitude of putting the blame into other people, and it is also about that other very human attitude of guiding our behaviors according to our feelings as opposed to common sense. It is about the importance of the teenage years for the future adult, and it is about how traumatic can it be to realize one was wrong. It is a movie that definitely makes you think.",American History X
358,sterlinrivera-2000,A Powerful and Thought-Provoking Spectacle,10,28 July 2021,"American History X is a very powerful, incredible, and significant film that has a unique message to it.This film is about Danny (played by Edward Furlong) who is a trouble making high school student that has the choice of either to be expelled due to writing a civil rights paper on Mein Kampf, or to create a new essay for his class, American History X. He chooses to write one on his brother, Derek (played by Edward Norton) who is a former neo-Nazi leader that got released from prison after a 3 year sentence, and is a changed man. Derek, returning home, notices Danny is slowly becoming what Derek once was, and tries to persuade him not to go down the wrong path by explaining to him his experience in prison.This film is very intriguing from start to finish. For 2 hours long, it ran in a very fast pace, it had such a fascinating story to it, and the best part of the whole film was the acting. Edward Norton was tremendous as a character that went from being a horrible human being and then coming out of prison as a changed man. It's a big shame he didn't win the Oscar for this film because his performance was top notch to the 20th power, and I would say this is his best film because of that. Edward Furlong was also very good playing the younger brother, Danny, and the two Edwards together had spectacular chemistry.All in all, American History X is one of my favorite films of all time that I highly recommend checking out for an important message, and a tremendous story.",American History X

It is one of my favorite movies, not because of the plot, because believe me, I'm not a prejudiced biggot like some of the characters in it, but because it puts the horrors and stupidity of racism and of being a racist.  Every person (black, white, whatever) knows someone of another race that they don't like, maybe there's a bunch of people from that race that they don't like, and they tell themselves that they're not racist.  It's most likely true that you are not. This movie displays how evil people can be just because they may be a racist.    This movie reveals a great truth: that hate doesn't help, it only makes you feel worse abiut yourself and makes people hate you more.  This movie has a great cast as well as a good plot.

While both were great in their own way, Remember the Titans is essentially a feel good movie which gives you that warm feeling at the end. This however is a movie which shows the shocking consequences that race wars can have. And brilliantly portrayed as well.Edward Norton plays a neo-Nazi character who organizes meetings for the D.O.A, a neo-Nazi kind of outfit. Frustrated at everyone, following his dad;s death in an accident, which he blames on the system of granting privileges to other races, he ends up in jail for murdering two black youths. The story traces his redemption in prison and how he tries to prevent his younger brother(Eddie Furlong) from going down the same path as he did.Edward Norton is brilliant as Derek Vinyard. He conveys the characters hatred for other races with such shocking reality. Only a fine actor as himself can pull off such a complex protagonist. Eddie Furlong is pretty okay as the younger brother, but Norton is definitely the star of the show. Another imposing presence is Avery Brooks, who plays the local high school principal, Dr. Sweeny Todd. The man brings an amazing screen presence and makes a huge impact.The movie was probably way too controversial for the academy's liking, which was why, i guess, it did not find favor at the Oscar's.

365,joaocruzferreira,NOT Just Another Drama,8,21 July 2007,"This unrelenting and provocative film that uses the word ""fuck"" over two-hundred times was made due to a great job by Tony Kaye, who creates this fascinating drama in his debut as a director. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, a scene that hasn't yet left my mind, is when Derek (Norton), being handcuffed in slow motion, connects eyes with his younger brother Danny (Furlong). That one glare tells the story of their intense relationship. In fact, that one scene is the screenplay of ""American History X"" in a glance. Artfully done.In a role where he had to gain thirty pounds of muscle, Edward Norton undoubtedly delivers the best performance of his career as the intimidating and yet uncomfortably human Derek Vinyard. Edward Furlong is also solid as the young and very confused Danny.""American History X"" is one of the most powerful movies ever released. Since ""Schindler's List"", I believe the subject of racism hasn't been tackled so masterfully.Unfortunately, despite the fact that ""American History X"" is one of the best films in years, it is quite underrated, only being nominated for one Academy Award.

Keach's performance is stunning and really deserved to be looked at for an award but this movie was way out there for any chance of that in 1998.William Russ turns in a short but powerful performance as the fireman father of Derek and Danny. The scene around the family table is true-to-life and instructive for families who endeavor to avoid the poison of prejudice and hate from scarring their homes.Alex Sol and Nicholas R.

368,MatBrewster,"Passionate, flawed film",7,14 March 2005,"It has been many years since I have seen this film. My memory attested it to be an excellent picture that meaningfully discussed issues as heavy as race relations, prejudice, and hatred. Unfortunately my memory is a little at fault, and upon viewing it this time I found it a bit disappointing. The film sets its sights to the heavens, and while succeeding in many ways, it could not attain such a lofty height. In trying to cover all the basis in such a thorny issue as race relations it cheats a bit in its storytelling. But we'll cover more of that in a bit.The plot involves a young, white Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and the tumultuous 24 hours after his release from prison for killing two black men, while they were trying to steal his car. Much of the story is told in a flash backed black and white. Here we learn that Derek was a Neo-Nazi skinhead leader who has had a change of heart after his stint in prison. Post prison time is being spent trying to keep his brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. A path he is already walking down.This is a powerful, moving film. Reading the boards on IMDb will attest to lives being changed through watching it. It works best when it shoots for an emotional response, rather than an intellectual one. Scenes such as when Edward Nortan's skin head leader rallies the troops to loot a local grocer, or the opening scene where we see Norton kill the two aforementioned black men, or a traumatic rape scene in prison, emit a guttural response from its viewers. It is in such scenes that we are rallied into discourse on the issues presented. Yet when the film gets talky it falls short of its ideals. It presents nothing beyond the general rhetoric you can find just about anywhere. In fact most of the rhetoric is spewed from the Neo-Nazi skinheads, and this type of discussion can be found every other day on day time talk shows. There is little in way of discussion from the rational, unprejudiced mind.There are two powerful performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. At this point Norton was already beginning to take his role as the new Robert DeNiro, who had previously taken his turn as the new Marlon Brando. Let's hope he escapes the fate of mediocrity that they fell into. Furlong who once made Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier with such a wooden performance, here has finally made himself worthy of attention. He gives a fine performance here, as a young man struggling with the passionate feelings of youth.Tackling an issue as heady as racism in America is a worthy, yet difficult cause. It proves to be too much for first time screenwriter David McKenna and director Tony Kaye. Trying to condense their story into regulation movie time they either skipped over completely or barely touched on some important issues. To give reasons for Derek's turn as a skinhead we are only allowed one small dinner table conversation with his father who spews some hateful race sentiments. This and his fathers murder at the hands of black addicts in a crack house, whom he was trying to save from a fire must suffice for an intelligent, middle class youths turn into a Nazi. Likewise his subsequent salvation in prison is not dwelt on enough to give us sufficient reasons for this turn of heart. Yes, the skinheads in prison are hypocrites, and yes the rape scene is brutal enough to turn away from their midst. But, his relationship with the black coworker, Lamont (Guy Torry) is not enough to change the heart of such hatred. Torry gives a fine performance, and does enough to show Derek that all blacks aren't as vile as the rhetoric made him believe, but are jokes about sex really going to make a skinhead believe in the goodness of the black race? In searching for a cause behind the Neo-Nazi scene in America the filmmakers seem to point directly towards the intense feelings of anger found in adolescence and the need to fit in with some social group. And rightly, these two issues play powerfully on the minds of many in the skinhead culture. But the issue goes deeper than this, and it is here, again, that this film misses the mark. Just as Derek dismisses issues of poverty, and social position in the plight of the black man this film seems to skim over some of the deeper motivation behind racism.Don't get me wrong. This is a powerful, well made film. There is plenty to chew upon and discuss. It is, in fact, a good film to watch with others and bring into light an important debate. Yet when I watch it I can't help but think of how it could have been better, how it could have reached the heights it was reaching for.Like this review?

369,charbelelaro,"""American History X"" is the true purpose of film",10,5 September 2017,"Let me begin by saying, this was not an easy film to watch. It was highly confronting surrounding aspects of racism in American society, as well as the unspeakable reality of prison. Although this is exactly what made this film great. I have not seen a film be this courageous in tackling issues that occur in society. Issues that people would rather be oblivious to, are completely exposed in this film. A large number of people steer away from films like this, and prefer to watch meaningless, poorly made films, as its an easy watch. And to a certain extent, light hearted movies are perfectly enjoyable. But ""American History X"" is the true purpose of film. As to why it is, can be described through various elements which make up and form this masterpiece.The first element is the cast. 'Edward Norton', as Derek was incredible, to say the least. His character possessed so much depth, which was slowly revealed to the audience as the film went on. He progressed and behaved so realistically, I no longer saw an actor playing a character. Furthermore, the casting of his entire family was perfect, in particular his younger brother Daniel played by 'Edward Furlong'. He portrayed a troubled teenage kid in the most realistic way. At times I was trying to pick flaws with aspects of his character that weren't as refined or polished, only to realise that these imperfections are true characteristics of any average kid. The history teacher, Dr. Bob Sweeney, played by 'Avery Brooks, also did a spectacular job, in trying to solve the complicated situation. The second element is the screenplay. This is how a screenplay should be written. Take a simple story-line, and execute it in the most complex way possible. This screenplay takes you on a journey, by firstly showing the situation at hand as a uninformed outsider, but then slowly gives you context and background as the film progresses. This was done so coherently with brilliant flashbacks, which by the end of the film, made you look at each character in an entirely new light. This was what made the film so engaging. The fact that I was curious to see what events shaped these characters, made the flashbacks feel very much anticipated. Also the dialogue between characters was sharp and gripping, especially in scenes where opposing ideas and opinions were battling against each other. It really built the intensity and tension in the film. The final element is the cinematography. The camera movement, and editing was exceptional. The way in which flashbacks were presented in black and white, gave past events much more power and intensity. I particularly liked the way in which there was a constant focus on water. The slow motion shots of dripping water in the shower, made you really feel the exhaustion and fatigue felt by the characters.Overall, the general reason as to why 'American History X' is the purpose of film, is due to the fact that it exposes its audience to confronting aspects of our world. It is able to inform people who may live sheltered lives, much like myself, about the racism and violence, which is a constant reality for many till this day. This film provides its audience with a wider view of the world, contributing to our worldly knowledge and awareness. This is all achieved due to the perfect execution of the elements in the film, discussed above, which all assist in making this film a true masterpiece.",American History X

The acting is above par but the story seems poor paced and the characters shallow.The basketball scene was one that I really didn't appreciate. Norton is elbowed early on by a black player (can you really blame him after Norton proudly displays his swastika tattoo), this is supposedly to make him the victim/hero of the scene.

377,SnobbyDude,Something didn't quite click....,6,28 March 2003,"I'm all over the place in evaluating this movie because the movie is a mess also. It's got a lot of good qualities and just as many bad ones.When you read the reviews of this movie, many people get the feel that it is a technical mess. I agree, that it was a technical mess too. I did enjoy it overall, but I didn't find it as enjoyable as it should have been. I have been thinking about this for a few days now since I have seen it. What was missing? I think it tries to bite off more than it can chew and that is its biggest weakness. It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions. The film is considerably bogged down by trying to solve a lot issues and emotion is lost. The focus of the entire story is shifted. Then we wind up with a complicated mess of answers, which, for me, raised more questions, because I wasn't sure I was satisfied with the answers/solutions I was given. It is a good film with great performances, especially by Norton. This is usually the kind of movie I don't enjoy watching because I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind. I like to watch movies for entertainment, not to feel like I'm being taught/lectured to. Do I sound like I am having a hard time making up my mind about this movie?I am!I liked it, but I can't put it on my list of top movies because it was too predictable and not very believable. I predicted the ending in the about 10 minutes before it happened and knew what was going to happen in the flashbacks every step of the way. Another thing I was wondering about was realism....I don't live in CA, and have never been to the bad areas, but is it possible that black gang-members would ever play basketball in Venice (I think it was Venice) with Neo Nazi's? I didn't think that scene was realistic. Also, the movie makes it sound like Neo Nazis are a real threat to society, but how many skinheads are there? I've never met one before, let alone seen one... I think, these days, people think being unbiased and objective means looking at 2 groups of people and being equally harsh in judging both of them. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life, but I think in attempting to try to be ""fair"", the movie makes with people out to be a much bigger threat to society than they are. Is there anyone in the USA that is afraid to go out at night because of Neo-Nazis? I think, in attempting to be be unbiased, the movie discredits itself and becomes unrealistic. This is a shame, but the bottom line is that this is a VERY complicated subject matter. I doubt anyone could really make a film of this nature without making lots of missteps.Rather than trying to find a solution, they should have let the audience decide what to think. I got annoyed when I was spoon fed the ""hate is baggage line."" Let me figure it out on my own! The best movies are the ones that make you think, not the ones that try to think for you.",American History X

379,tommyboy-16,the real treasure of hatred,8,15 January 2001,"I gave this movie a solid 8 and it came real close to sliding into a 9 spot. The violence and language is not for the tender. The brutality of the body and spirit is necessary for the story line. The movie would lose its gut impact without it. Gut impact is a good word for the feeling this movie renders.This film is not center staging violence nor does it take the easy road with quick glimpses of passionate sex. The star is an emotion. It has survived since the beginning of time. Sometimes it appears to be the only thing that lasts. This emotion is hatred. We watch as a family unravels before our eyes because of hatred then tries to mend itself by changing course.The movie does a real good job of showing both sides of the tracks. It covers some real tough social and economic problems that are too often and incorrectly tagged to a certain group. Derek, the skinhead, does have some real true issues and is a hurting being, like many other humans in this world. He is a section of society that feels left out and left behind and becomes angry about it.  He makes some good points and some obnoxious points. He falls into a pit that all bigots descend into by concluding that society's problems would be eliminated with certain groups being exterminated and or severely controlled. The story is not totally one sided as many times it's simply survival of the strong. It's kind of like living on the grasslands of Africa where there are predators and prey. In this case blacks and whites prey on each other as well as being a cannibalistic beast so to speak. Sometimes they are living in fear and are just trying to survive. When you deal with hatred one can't dance with the devil without getting a little stain on one's dress. In the case of Derek's family the stain runs deep. We all may be quick to judge one of these groups, but we never know what our reactions would be unless we have been in their shoes and had to survive.Edward Norton plays Derek perfectly. I have never seen an actor look like a mean and nasty neo-nazi skinhead one-minute and then a pencil pushing office room geek the next. The change was due to Derek's epiphany he had in prison and the help of a good-natured high school teacher. While in prison, Derek learned what brutality is and that skin color or a matching tattoo does not guarantee loyalty and sincerity. He found that skin color is only a difference and should not be a  guidance system to hate. He realizes the bigger picture and then discovers guilt. He learns life is too short. He must carry his guilt that only becomes a bigger burden once freedom rings.This movie is a very good movie and portrays hatred as purely evil and rightly so. In this movie it's not all whitey or blackie's fault. I applaud the movie for that. Sometimes a movie similar to this makes blacks look all bad or that all whites hate everyone different from themselves. In this movie both groups are brutalized and each ones actions, while being a horrible injustice, may be more understandable if we lived in their world. There would have been a few things I would have done differently in this movie as a director, but not much. My score of 8 is a score that I do not give out very often. I would not recommend this movie to everyone and especially young kids who are easily impressionable. I know many feel this movie reveals only  the evil side but a person, that relates to one of these groups, might concentrate or only feel the raw power in the violence and find it mesmerizing. Not a movie for everyone!",American History X
380,ad2020,Just had to see it!!!,10,6 January 2001,"And I'm glad I did!! I went into this movie like so many other people (probably because the thought of Nazis is enough to get me me to go get a gun and be rid of these people), and, of course, I came out better for the wear. The film and the way it portrayed (kind of cut-and-paste editing) is very effective for something this real and brutal. SPOILERS, it's not going to be pretty...... It states that Derek tries to prevent his brother from becoming a skinhead soldier like he was, if anything, he's preventing him from being affiliated w/ the neo-Nazis since he doesn't want him to be marked like he was (which we see power by affiliation and it's causes), also, I'm sure Danny watching his brother curb-check a Crip (who,if you ask me, probably wouldn't have kissed the curb anyway)and then look at his expression of anger and pride when he's arrested, it tends to keep one from ever wanting to become anything that barbaric. I couldn't swallow the fact that someone like Derek would reform their beliefs after prison, but being raped by your own kind and realizing that you should look to better your life rather than your pride (also finding out that your leader is a squealer helps), would make someone wake up and change things anew (good thing I realized this in my life as well, this validates this film portraying how hatred turn one's ability to love into destruction.) My qualm w/ this film, and this does tend to happen in real life, is the fact that Sweeney asks Derek to talk skinheads out of being skinheads, especially since Sweeney understands that Derek needs breathing room for being back into the outside world, that was just plain wrong, but it also makes the ending more hard-hitting than it would've been. I say no matter who you are, check this out, but if your looking for a political agenda, I have to say I deeply symphatize w/ your ignorance. A 10!!!",American History X

But the entire film borders on masterpiece level. Very important film that all should see, even if you have to watch partially blindedfolded to get through the difficult parts.

His actions, as well as those of Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks and especially Guy Torry, are flawless.It's the story of how a bright kid, Derek Vinyard (Norton), with wrong ideas gets in to a skinhead-gang because of a cunning leader who uses him for his own purposes, to establish nazism in America. Its frightening to see how much Dereks racistic opinions makes sense when hes arguing for them, I almost found myself agreeing with Derek(!), and its easy to understand how some people have gone so bad because of group mentality.Then, when we watch Dereks life in prison, it feels like i'm being redempted myself. He befriends a black guy (Torry), learns how he got more years there for stealing a TV than Derek got for his double murder, and he is astounded. He (we) suddenly see through his clever arguing, and discover how stupid his ideas really is.This is a hands down MIGHTY movie, and one of the best you will ever see.

The trauma that his sons experience leads Derek (Edward Norton) into the path of the white supremasive movement. He becomes a skinhead who rallies other disaffected whites into a movement that rejects not only blacks but also Asians, and those of Spanish heritage. He becomes a hero to the white supremacists and organizes attacks against those he blames for his father's death.He winds up in prison for the death of several blacks who tried to either steal of damage his car. Whether those black were stealing or vandalizing car remains vague in the story line. Never-the-less he ends up in prison for three years where he learns first hand the hypocrisy of race relations. He befriends a black inmate who was mistreated by the criminal justice system, and soon reject his affiliation with the white/Aryans crowd.A commentary on this film cannot be complete without mentioning DR. Sweeney. A black professor who encourages his students to write an essay about issues of civil rights. Derek's brother writes about Mein Kampf. At about the same time Norton gets released from prison and goes about rejecting his path of hate.This is one of the best film I've watched. I highly recommend viewing this film.

The whole history of America rests on that. So basically the movie covers it all and so justifies the title.
And if you look at the world and and that's the only problem we have, if we could just short out our religious, racial, fascist beliefs, it will be all. Be it any country, its always about the differences. I India-religious , in America-racial.
It can't always be t** for tat. You can't be selectively good or bad, you are what you are for everybody.
The movie drives one point really well, that hate begets hate and nothing else, no victory no prosperity only the doom, death and destruction. The earlier we get the point the earlier we can save ourselves from the doom.

386,Navaros,"Very contrived, badly-acted and unrealistic soapbox movie to let us know ""Racism is bad!""",1,19 February 2008,"American History X is a very contrived and unrealistic soapbox movie against racism. The purpose of the movie is simple: beat viewers over the head with a simplistic message that they all already agree with in the first place! Namely, ""Racism is bad!"" Everyone already knows racism is bad, so a movie comprised of 2 hours worth of strung-together ridiculous contrivances that exists solely for the purpose to push the message ""Racism is bad"" is not exactly a work of art. Nor is it food for thought. This movie won't tell anyone anything that they don't *already know*, therefore the existence of the movie is pointless.Edward Norton plays a hardcore Nazi skinhead. He *looks* the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth, any chance of him being believable in that role is utterly destroyed. Edward Norton talks like - and has the demeanour of - a computer geek. There is no way to reasonably be immersed in believing he is a hardcore Nazi skinhead. For this reason I'm going to have to say Edward Norton gives a terrible performance in this movie. *Good* actors can change their voice, demeanour, and the aura they give off. Edward Norton cannot. He uses the exact same voice, and has the exact same wimpy computer geek demeanour/aura in American History X as he does in every single movie role he ever does. It bewilders me why such a bad actor - with no range whatsoever - is so popular. It actually makes this movie be *unintentionally hilarious* to see such a buffed guy be so incredibly wimpy and non-threatening.Edward Furlong plays his little brother. Furlong gives a good performance as always, however, he isn't given anything to work with. All his lines are very generic and bland.Avery Brooks gives an okay performance as the school principal, but there is nothing special about it. He's exactly the same in this movie as he is as Sisko in Deep Space Nine, or the gangster in the movie The Big Hit. Actually it seems Avery Brooks has actually *dialed down* his intensity in American History X; an intensity he has in all those other roles but *not* in American History X. So I must conclude that Brooks' performance in American History X is worse than usual.Edward Norton is supposed to be playing an extremely smart individual, yet his actions in this movie are anything but. He foolishly sets up a chain of events where if he had any intelligence at all, he would have foreseen that that chain of events would be sure to lead to his rape in prison. He also would easily have avoided prison in the first place if he had any intelligence. He also would have been able to prevent the bad ending his brother receives if he had any intelligence. Yet he sticks around the neighborhood like a moron at the end of the movie, which is what allows for his brother to be murdered.The ending of the movie is ridiculous, and actually ends up *reinforcing* the (incorrect) idea that Norton's character's original beliefs in this movie are accurate. The movie exists to say ""Racism is bad!"" in big flashing NEON letters. However, the ending of this movie (perhaps inadvertently) completely destroys this message by implying that Norton's character was right to be a Nazi skinhead. The ending of the movie has a Black guy murdering Furlong's character for no reason. Furlong blew smoke in his face earlier in the movie, but that is not a reason to shoot someone dead over (maybe a beat down at the very most). It is not something someone would do in real life. Yet this movie (perhaps racistly) has a Black kid killing a White kid for no reason whatsoever, which lends (tragically!) undeserved credibility to idea that the Nazi beliefs are correct and Norton's character was wrong to abandon them. This movie can't even get it's own very basic message right.0/10.",American History X
387,s_iliya_p,What a performance!,8,24 March 2019,"This movie has been finally crossed off of my watchlist. Apart from the fact that it's kinda clear how the story will develop, I have nothing against this movie. You can really tell what exactly will happen in each scene, so no big twists or surprises. However, the story is good enough to keep your focus in tact.Mr. Norton has shown his great range, and ability for long monologues. What I ejoyed about the movie is the variety of scenes, certainly took them a long time to prepare all the locations.I'm not sure if this movie is re-watchable, for my taste it has been too strong and long, that said, I understand if so many other people would watch it more than once.It's a great piece on not only Neonazism but rasism itslef, and what rasicm may bring to a society. It emphasizes on the great dangers of prejudices among all races which is not exclusive to a certain country or skin color, even sadder!
I was wondering how easily the adolescent could be radicalized, and how important it is to educate them properly; specifically, parents' role in this. With everything going on in the world, now, watching this movie is for sure justified and well-advised for it shows a great deal of radicalized, emotionally abused, and hyped-up actions and their inevitable consequences.",American History X
388,moumindaherabtidon,"Worth the watch, but not perfect.",9,19 April 2019,"I'm probably too emotionally charged to be writing this but that might just be why I need to do it, so here we go...The movie started strong. It introduced the characters and the environment in a not-so-linear-timeline which is a plus because it kept me wondering not only what's going to happen but also what had happened while still keeping me engaged in what is happening. Hard to pull off this kind of method of storytelling, but he (the screenwriter, i guess) nailed it. At least to a certain point towards the end of the movie where everything started to crumble. That ""certain point"" was right after the father scene. That moment was the climax and the pinnacle of this film. It made the ""not-so-linear-timeline storytelling method"" all the more perfect for the movie and contributed to very writing of this scene. But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about how EVERYTHING began to fall apart afterwards... HOW? Ok, let's take a look:1] The main character had a belief, that belief had roots buried in his soul, a belief he lived by through YEARS of his life. You'd think that would mean something, right? ""Oh, my fellow white men rapped me and beat me, maybe they're not so good after all. And oh, i befriended this Black guy, maybe they're not so bad"". I don't think that's how it works in real life. But then again you need to recognize the problem to fix it. Was he a racist? A nazi? A white-supremacist? All of the above? Doesn't matter, it should've took something more deep and meaningful to get rid of any of those, let alone all.2] Why? What purpose did the murder of the brother serve?

This film could have been even greater than it was, but probably thanks to production squabbles, it wasn't.  The black-and-white sequences were superb and very well done.  In comparison, the present time sequences are poor but still well done.     Even though the acting in the film was excellent, a lot of things could have been done to make this film better.  I think the prison sequence could have been even longer, and I would have preferred if we saw just how changed Derek really was.  I also felt like I didn't really know Faruiza Balk's character very well, but this could be a good thing showing she was a one-dimensional idiot.        I was really impressed with the way they made Edward Norton look in his skinhead prime, he actually looked menacing and scary.  I also liked the directing style for some strange reason.  Someone pointed out before it seemed amateurish, but I disagree. This was a good, thought-provoking film.  It showed where racists get their beliefs and just how crazy something out of control can become.  It showed the horrors of hate crimes in a way other movies have failed to do in fear of being too frightening.

391,StoryCharts,Prejudice and bigotry will kill our children,9,14 August 2013,"American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.American History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.The movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit.

This has to be one of the most powerful films ever made on racism. The story, performances, camera, music all feel so real and thought provocative. It tells the story of Derek, a white supremacist nazi skinhead and how he transforms and now just wants his little brother Danny to not go down the same path. The narrative is non linear where the past is periodically shown in B/W while the present is in color. One of the most haunting aspects of the film is it's background score which is among the best I have heard. The writing is balanced and nuanced and it shows. Because honestly the plot is slim but the screenplay they made out of it is bloody brilliant. The film explores hate and the effect it has on people. The constant struggle is there to see, some scenes are very hard to watch and are extremely violent on the eyes and mind. We have all seen films portraying racism in one form or the another. But there is something in this film which stands out among them. And that is Edward Norton's jaw dropping performance as Derek Vinyard. He lights the screen on fire in the scenes he is delivering dialogues which reek of hate. It was a laudable performance. But I was left wanting for more. I do feel a bit more of Derek's back story on his journey into becoming a white supremacist could have been explored to add another layer. The film has a brutal climax which I didn't expect at all. It kind of comes a full circle in the end. The final moments of the film ends with an Abraham Lincoln's quote written for a paper by Danny he submitted for his AMERICAN HISTORY X class.

393,MikeSmash,American History X: A Lesson in Excellent Movie-Making,10,12 January 2006,"American History X gives us an intense look into the ugly ramifications of racism & Neo-Nazism run amok in the lives of a select group of people in our society. AHX shows how even a microcosm of society's ""Aryan Brotherhood"" can vastly change people's lives forever. The basic plot is presented in an ""in your face"" demeanor, as well as paints a very realistic picture of exploding racism, territoriality & a deteriorating social fabric as we know it. AHX pulls you in to the story of Derek Vinyard, an intelligent & arrogant young future Neo-Nazi leader who is sent to prison for manslaughter, reforms his hateful ways & beliefs while befriending a black inmate, gets out of prison to save his younger brother Danny from taking his former path, & makes a major choice to leave the Nazi gang for good with dire consequences. This is one powerful piece of film-making, with the viewer walking away to an unbelievable ending. It is not the controversial story that grabs you but the riveting performance by Edward Norton that will blow you away! Edward Norton's performance as rising Neo-Nazi leader & reformed convict Derek Vinyard was as Oscar-worthy a bad guy as ""Silence of the Lambs"" Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. Norton will make you hate him & love him in the same breath!! For such a young actor, Norton brings an innocence & veteran actor's skills to the film's success. With a solid supporting cast including Edward Furlong, Beverly D' Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Stacey Keach, Elliot Gould & Avery Brooks behind him, Norton flourishes in his role complete with foul mouth, toned physique, shaved head, and Nazi tattoos to complete the ensemble'.This film gives the viewer a true sense of the hatred & bigotry expressed in each black & white flashback(the entire movie was done in most scenes shown in retrospect). I appreciated the ""hit over the head"" messages portrayed which does not glorify but brings responsibility to the outright & overt prejudice running rampant throughout the film. For those who accept realism & can handle blatant truth, I highly recommend anyone to see this film, over the age of 18, of course. AHX is a wake-up call to all those who enjoy a film with teeth, and boy does this one bite you!! Tony Kaye does a wonderful job bringing together competent actors, smart technical film-making, & a very, very controversial & sensitive plot.

Ed Furlong also gives a good show as Mr. Norton's little brother. The most disturbing thing about this movie, I think, is the fact that I found myself seeing points in what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was saying. What if Rodney King had hit a kid, then attacked the police? Would we be thinking the opposite? And what his father was saying about two white men who scored higher on the fireman's test than two black men, but didn't get the jobs because of affirmative action. Honestly, I don't support that kind of thing. If there are seven white men and three black men who have the credentials for ten top jobs, then those are the men who should get the jobs, not five men, five women, or five white men, five black women.

In other words, I rarely am dazzled by, stunned by or otherwise totally believing in the characters I have seen Ed Norton, Jr. play. He is the star of two of the most overrated films in history--Fight Club and American History X--both currently appearing in the top 50 here on IMDb.com. 50. The top 50 movies that have ever been made? Give me a break.Don't get me wrong--like Fight Club, American History X is an entertaining and interesting film that is certainly worth a look. Not for a second was I bored during either, and I have given this one a positive rating (6 out of 10). My problem is mainly with Ed Norton, Jr.'s acting. As is usually the case with Norton vehicles, at no point was I unaware that I was watching Ed Norton, Jr., and I had a load of trouble believing in his fanatical racist character here.Maybe Mr. Norton just seems like too much of a nice guy to me. I do not hate the guy. I like him. Maybe that's my problem. In this one in particular, he really came across to me, somehow, as a person who is passionately opposed to racism. I felt he had trouble totally committing to the role, I guess. Not in an obvious way that I can really detail, but that's how I actually felt. It did not feel real to me.If you disagree with my point about Norton, you'll probably love this flick just like almost everyone that bothered to comment on it here. Besides the unfortunate casting of Norton as fanatical racist, it was pretty good.But speaking of fanaticism, I would really appreciate a little less fanaticism regarding Ed Norton, Jr.'s work. Really. Ed Norton, Jr. plays a fanatical racist? What's next? Ed Norton, Jr. plays Adolph Hitler? Ed Norton, Jr. plays Satan? Whatever. I think Norton needs to be cast in roles that are not quite as evil as his role here. The same exact problem plagues Fight Club as well as The Score. Something about his face, and his voice--it leaves a sort-of-cherubic impression, at least to me. He needs to be cast in more sympathetic and/or heroic roles like he was in The People vs. Larry Flynt.",American History X

It follows a Neo - Nazi Skinhead whose burning hatred towards the ""black"" society (started by his fathers death caused by such individuals) spirals out of control over time. He surrounds himself with fellow followers starts gaining major credit off these followers for his acts almost earning legendary status.He trains and Carry's out small escapades attacking shops and claiming back territory round his home town.Then one night whilst his truck is getting broken into at the peak of his hatred he kills the burglars. Sending him to prison.Whilst he's in prison his brother gets deeper and deeper into the world of black hatred heavily influenced by old friends.Upon leaving prison a changed man Derek seeks to drag his brother out the mindless brainwashing he found himself fall into at the same age.This film is quite simply amazing. The acting is outstanding Norton gives the performance of a life time as does Edward Furlong. I was never a huge fan of Edward Norton before this to tell the truth i found him bland and boring but this opened my eyes to what this guy can do.The story is handled perfectly and slowly builds up to it's shocking finale.the settings are perfect and extremely believable.The dialogue is handled just right as is the level of violence. It is definitely not for the faint hearted there are some pretty nasty and graphic scenes. This is not a ""nice"" film. But at the same time it never over does the violence going too over the top.I loved the way it always left in the dark for a while then brought you up to speed later. It let you develop an opinion and then tested it.The flashbacks to Dereks time in prison were a prefect example of this.All in all this a film anyone can and will enjoy.It Carry's a very important message. It shows that racism and hatred are both terrible things and don't get you anywhere they only come back and you and hurt you and the ones you love.

Most of the thought-provoking and large-scale shocking cases in history are also examples of distortions in faith. But Tony Kaye chose a more painful process. He stripped the coat of faith subversion and exposed this difficult transformation process nakedly to the world, but it is also so that he can deeply touch the heart of the audience. The most secret reserve.",American History X
403,pgear83,Asking the Right Questions,10,16 June 2008,"A genuinely moving and inspirational experience, American History X ranks one of the best films I've ever seen. Edward Norton gives one of the great performances of all time as Derek Vinyard, a former skinhead trying to make amends and save his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from the same path. The narrative is non-linear, alternating between the present and flashbacks to various points in the past. The flashbacks are presented in black and white, representing both the static and unchanging nature of the past and the simplistic former world-view of Derek.Norton is not only great in his performance, but frightening as well. He is articulate, intelligent and sometimes for a moment, he almost seems to make sense. Unlike, say, Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York, his character cannot be dismissed as a relic of history; there are people like this around today. His rhetoric embodies everything that is both dangerous and alluring about the Right, whether in the form of the Nazis of the past or the Neo-Conservatives of the present. It feeds upon the vulnerability of the ignorant, upon fear and disillusionment and the need to feel victimized. From what he says, you would think that white Americans were at the mercy of some kind of hegemony of minorities, rather than the other way around (listen to the drunk college students in 'Borat' for a disturbing real-life example of this). We are ""losing our right to pursue our destiny,"" Derek preaches before leading his gang to commit acts of terrorism and thievery. Where anyone who is not a WASP fits into this ""destiny"" is not made clear, but the words are hypnotic like Danny's Iron Cross swinging in front of his computer screen. These people hide behind false patriotism, using it as a tool for justifying the ugliest acts imaginable. The presence of the American flag is pervasive throughout the film (early on we see Danny picking his teeth with a miniature American flag, a brilliant metaphor for the above).Eventually, Derek kills two blacks (perhaps the most sickening sound effect in movie history was that guy's teeth on the curb; if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) and is sent to prison for three years. There, he meets and eventually befriends a black man who is there longer for a much lesser crime and he starts to see through his own rhetoric. He is changed both by his realization of the complex nature of the world and of the flaws in his manner of going about things. His former teacher (Avery Brooks) advises him, ""You have to ask the right questions,"" and asks ""Has anything you've done made your life better?"" Salvation will come not through rhetoric and being vindictive, but only through working to change things for the better because as Danny later says, ""Life's too short to be (expletive)ed off all the time."" After Derek gets out of prison, he severs his ties with the old ""chicken-hawk"" Cameron Alexander, who had previously been his mentor and who was now courting his brother. Danny is outraged when Derek snubs his former followers and after catching up to him, noisily beats him against a metal garage-like door while Derek calmly repeats to him, ""Take it easy."" That is perhaps the main message that we take away from American History X (and one also brought into focus in Paul Haggis' Crash). People are too quick to anger and too slow to accept responsibility for themselves. In this film, as in life, the easiest answers are seldom the right ones, everything is more complicated than it seems, and there are unfortunate consequences to actions that not even the best of intentions can allay. But 'Taking it easy' is an important step in the right direction.To conclude, this is another (perhaps unfortunately) timeless piece of film-making. The US is heading into what will likely be the ugliest election in its history. That ""Southern Strategy"" of race-baiting will be used, perhaps more subtly than in the past, but powerfully and more than ever. It seems that John McCain's only chance will be the rallying of men like (pre-redemption) Derek Vinyard. In any case, the soul of a nation is on the line, and we're all going to be rising up or going down with them to some degree, whether we like to admit it or not. Though those outside of the US may feel powerless in this struggle, we can at least share in a great work of art like this movie, and receive some illumination as to the nature of the issues at play.",American History X
404,wittkecmission,Hate is baggage,10,2 January 2020,"HERE'S a movie that people try to avoid talking about. The most powerful, iconic, and infamous scene in American History X, as you may have guessed, is the curb stomp scene. When I first saw Edward Norton's character kick that robber's head on the curb, I actually felt my head split open in unison with the guy and my heart plummet into my stomach. The shot that followed also really got me, in which Norton, as he is being arrested, puts his hands on his head and turns around. His eyes are wide open and staring at his dumb-struck younger brother, his eyebrows raised, and his smile stretching ear to ear. Across his face are etched the words, ""I have no regrets. Absolutely no regrets."" The film is a shocking and tremendously powerful one that has a strong message about the immorality of Nazism and racism. It's a visit to a world that most of us hope to never encounter, let alone join. Surprisingly, the graphic content in this film doesn't compel me to give it a lower rating. There's a equilibrium in the violent and nonviolent scenes, which is why I'm giving this film a 10/10",American History X
405,Kynde,A rough but great movie!,10,4 March 1999,"This is one of the roughest movies I have seen. It takes you through all the emotions. I cried and laughed, and then I cried again. In this movie we are shown the most terrifying murder that I have seen on film. It really felt like someone put a knife in my guts, and turned it around. This is the only reason, why this movie should not be one of the best. On the other hand, it could also be another reason for it to be even better, because it dares to show the main actor doing such a terrible thing. And even though you know he did this, you learn so much about him, that you later in the movie forgive him, because he changes, and at the end, he is almost a hero in your mind. When I read the comment of Ari NY on the main page, two days before I saw the film, I thought that he most certainly overrated this movie. But now I have to admit that he was right. I wouldn't say this is the best movie I ever saw, but it's up there with the greatest. And I agree with Ari that Edward Norton deserves the Oscar as best actor compared to Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. I haven't seen all the other movies so I can't say anymore about that. But I can say: ""Go and watch this movie on the big screen, but be prepared for the roughness.""",American History X

(In my personal pantheon, he already has.) This is the sort of film that I eat up, given its human rights/politically-oriented theme and its somewhat bombastic script. (That's not meant in a bad way, despite what it may seem.) It's Norton's eyes that do it - witness his facial expression as he turns to face the camera, hands over his head, ready to be handcuffed. Compare that with his prison scenes, his reunion with his family, and his confrontation with his gang of skinhead disciples. I think you'll see what I mean.",American History X

But Edward Norton, every film is a near-perfect with hes perfect acting skills. the role in this film is not a typical role for him, in the other movie he played. A lot of mixed feelings while watching the viewer. Between anger and compassion, the pity and hate, between love and disappointment. And Very moving ending. Somehow, after watching the film, it will be hard to stop thinking about him and connect with your real life. But I know it happened to me and I'm pretty sure it was everyone else watching this film.

Edward Norton produces an outstanding performance as Derek, and Edward Furlong creates a believable and likeable-in-spite-of-his-mixed-up-politics little brother.  I rated this film 9/10, and the only thing keeping it from 10/10 was the script, which occasionally gets a little preachy, and at times I was aware that the characters were functioning as a mechanism to try and educate me, the viewer, not talking to each other.  Norton was up last year for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Derek here...why wasn't this film up for a Best Picture award?  It's a stunner.",American History X
409,Rumples-2,Very good - with minor drawbacks,8,24 January 2000,"There is simply no question that this is a very stylish and provocative movie. Equally it is true that it has its limitations - due largely to time and production restraints (and the odd influence of hollywood/mass market appeal) - and a few too many simplistic resolutions/devices. Norton does a typically superb job and is quite adequately supported by the remainder of the cast - but this remains Norton's film. On the whole, a movie likely to shock or offend some, move many, and influence almost all. Definitely worth a watch. My vote 8/10",American History X
410,Johnny0581,Underrated gem,10,9 March 2005,"What can I say, this movie is hands down the best of 1998 and one of the best films of the decade. This movie was definitely underrated when it came out, and Edward Norton should've won an Academy Award for his tour-de-force performance, and also the director, Tony Kaye for best director.This movie tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Norton) a young man in Venice Beach, California. The story is narrated by his younger brother, Danny, played by Edward Furlong, who is following his big brother's footsteps by being part of a neo-Nazi skinhead group, and basically taking his life and future down the drain. Danny's professor, played by Avery Brooks gives him an assignment on his own big brother after he had done a previous one on Hitler, and the professor of course, rejected it.The movie goes back and forward in time through Danny's narration to highlight the events leading to Derek ending up in prison for three years, and later on the story is told from Derek's own perspective starting from the time he went to prison until he gets out. There's also a strong supporting cast here; Avery Brooks is great as Danny's professor Dr. Sweeney, Ethan Suplee does a very good job as Seth, who is close to Danny and Derek and also shares the same beliefs, Stacy Keach as Cameron, the leader of the local skinhead group, Fairuza Balk as Derek's girlfriend Stacy, and Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's mother, all do a great job in their respective roles. The movie is very gripping and it will keep you glued to your seat whether you're a fan of this genre or not, because the performances are sizzling. This is by far one of Edward Norton's best roles in his career. The movie touches on a topic not many movies dare to touch on, racism, and has strong pervasive language and some very disturbing scenes, so it's not for everyone, but it's an Oscar-worthy movie nonetheless. A rare underrated gem. Ten out of ten!",American History X

I just want to say that if the director, Tony Kaye, ever reads my comment here I want to say that you made a very big mistake by discrediting and disowning such a fine masterpiece of cinema.

With hatred comes violence. With violence comes incarceration. With incarceration comes more violence, which could sometimes lead to tolerance. This is how a vicious cycle comes full circle with a young man named Derek Vinyard.""American History X"" is a movie about a young white male, with far above average intelligence whose father is murdered by a black gunman, is subsequently taught to hate. Instead of having the capacity to understand a bad coincidence for what it is, and let justice take its course, he turns the shooting into a racial incident. His inability to see the truth, digs a hole for himself that he may not be able to get out of.The movie is put together with a series of flashbacks, alternating black & white scenes (the past) with color scenes (the present). Edward Furlong plays 16- year-old high school student, Daniel Vinyard, who has just been punished by his principal, for handing in an essay praising Adolf Hitler. His sentence: He must write a five-page essay covering the arrest, conviction, and incarceration of his older brother Derek, a Nazi skinhead.Derek Vinyard, (Edward Norton), has just been released from prison on parole, for the shooting death of two blacks who were on his property, attempting grand theft. Even though he had the right to protect his family, he took vigilantism to an extreme. He was charged with second-degree murder.Derek wants to turn his life around, close out his relationship with the neo-Nazi skinheads, and keep his brother Daniel as far away from them as possible. The problem is, that in the long time Derek spent in jail, Daniel had become much involved with the skinheads, their lifestyle, and their language. With his bald head and dark clothing, Daniel now even looks like a little skinhead.Now the question is will Derek be able to convince Daniel to stay clear of the skinheads? And if he does, is Daniel too far involved to be saved? ""American History X"" is a good movie, but the ending is disturbing and sends a wrong message that is inconsistent with a story that begins pitifully, but progresses hopefully. The movie has too many flashbacks, and put together with the scenes in color make the film choppy in texture. Also the Edward Norton character never has the swastika on his chest surgically removed, which makes you wonder whether he has really changed. All In all, ""American History X"" is powerful movie, but not really a great one.",American History X
415,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,One of those films that makes you think,10,18 February 2010,"American History X isn't a movie just for Americans. I'm Australian, and any country with a history of neo nazism or racism or hate can watch this and understand it. Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is seeking revenge after the murder of his firefighting dad. Derek is idolized by Danny, his younger brother (Edward Furlong). I won't give anything away, but take note that this film is split between flash backs and the present (it's easy to tell). This movie isn't preachy, it just tells you the story. It's message is clear and although the movie is full of disturbing, violent scenes, the grim reality of the movie is hard hitting, gritty and unforgettable. Quite simply, American History X is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The performances are amazing from Norton and Furlong as well as Elliot Gould (who plays a Jewish teacher, a short yet memorable performance) It's a rare movie that doesn't shove anything down your throat, but let's you think for days after the credit has rolled. And that's a rare thing",American History X
416,hamass-mujadid,"Hey Dolphy, Hit Me So I Can Hit You Back",7,15 March 2015,"Feurer, command—we follow. It was the slogan of Hitler's tsunami back in those days, which is still found in individuals, underground single-man and obsessive people; they're obsessed with a certain lifestyle, and believe not in discussion, neither in argumentation, but in imposition. Bald-headed or not, individuals like Derek are reality, so are Danny(s) who're confused in choosing roads. What makes their predicaments even worse is the double-minded composition of the world, and that's something that is going to remain constant for a long time. Hence, so are the extremist mobs. I'm not declaring them wrong, I'm only calling them ambivalent. I'm aware of the Holocaust and the society that thinks it's perfectly justified. I wouldn't contradict their viewpoint, but my promulgation will certainly devise the conduct of suggestion, interaction, and double-exchange rather than straight exterminations. I don't wish to be called a monologue-r, although that title gains more viewer-ship. ""Appeal to popularity"" is an argumentative fallacy that individuals of all levels adopt in their conversational discourse. Now let's go to the review. American History X captures absence/lack/irrationality of egalitarianism in a very unique way. Using Nazism, it extends its effects to the black community. Edward Norton (crazy-eyes) suited the role only from physical and expressive way; he was pretty bad from the ""vocal"" perspective; the guy can't do working-class roles at all; I mean let's face it, the guy's voice appears to be of an over-intellectualized kid doing weed, not a hipster or gangster. His acting nonetheless was superb, like when officers are arresting him and he looks at Danny with that psychotic smile (crazy-eyes, no?) The nigga-facta was good. Almost all the extras in the movie were African-Americans. I think this was a directorial flaw. America's still flowing with Whites. I'm not personally against blacks, in fact I've a lot of Afro-Am friends myself. But that doesn't mean that you flood the set with them. But then looking at the low-budget, it's acceptable. Moreover, the movie didn't look at perfection, but realism and digging the small-scale on-goings in America and potentially all over the globe.American History has nothing but Norton's acting and screenplay (even that limited to the amount of touch with real-life scenario). But what it has is delivered with excellence. The story keeps you ponder over the ruthlessness of all sides. The world isn't so perfect as shown. You can't expect things to be rational, or mildly reasonable. Even paternal guidance isn't entirely logical, neutral and aimed at resolving physical and mental issues. I was hit down by the movie, and I started to question the logical sense and accuracy of ""white man's burden"" claim. From Derek's skull-crushing to his assault in prison, and from that to Danny's ultimate redemption, everything builds up your trust with the movie, and believe me, whatever it says, you'll start following it the same way. So yeah that's probably the only good-thing about it. With everything said, I think if you look from the low-budget perspective and director's mindset, you'll realize that film's intention and imparting was limited and it successfully got what it aimed. However, from the dramaturgical viewpoint, it lacks several accessories.",American History X
417,jacobywarner,A Brutally Raw Take on a Sensitive Topic,8,26 November 2019,"What a fantastic raw film that focusses on showing not only the brutal acts that hate groups commit, but also showing the human elements that contributes to the corruption of adolescence. Everything about this movie is incredible from the themes that it tackles to the stylistic choices made by the filmmakers. One in particular is Tony Kaye's choice to use black and white footage to represent the changing of opinions had by Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton), physically showing how black and white everything began. Along with these awesome choices all the actors performances were on point in this film, Edward Norton is at his best giving the audience a look into his characters personal psyche. Another incredible part of this movie that I think is worth mentioning is the use of violence. I think the reality of violence in films is almost glamorized in a lot of films taking away the horror of simple acts, but not in this film. The first sequence of this film is of a brutal depiction of violence which physically makes the audience sick, and with every viewing you find yourself more and more upset with Darek Vinyard.But before I rate this film I would like to say that I was not a fan of the aspect ratio they chose to use, I know that this might not be the largest detail but I still wanted to bring it up.

421,willsgb,by no means black and white,9,9 September 2008,"It's important to retain a sense of objectivity throughout this film, which keeps skewing and provoking reaction and consideration with controversial situations, imagery and dialogue that explores the dangerous and volatile issue of racism and social tensions in brutal depth. it's not perfect but in dealing with such complex and deeply rooted societal flaws, prejudices and ignorance it tests the viewer and forces lengthy consideration and discussion. it is an engaging, magnificently powerful and important article.Norton steals the show with his fierce and terrifyingly focused portrayal of young front leader Derek Vinyard, while John Connor - a perfectly cast Furlong - plays his impressionable brother Danny, handed a special assignment by his black head-teacher, to write an examination of the racial hostility issue relating to Derek, his family and society in modern America. Derek is released from prison that day.what unfolds is a compelling story brought together through flashbacks, dialogue, confrontations and self reflection that does not hold back, a difficult amalgam of social conflict that plays out in the most destructive and devastating way possible to examine the reactions of the participants. Derek's was a once prosperous family in a nice house, until fire-fighting father was shot putting out a blaze at a crack den; Derek allied with the manipulative Cameron, asserting his dominance playing a black gang off the basketball court. at school Danny defends Malcolm in the middle Francis from a couple of black kids, which will have repercussions.the cinematography and shot selection is crisp and evocative and important scenes are slowed down for maximum impact; a haunting choir and score reinforces the conflagrations, murders and epiphanies that yank this movie from hope to despair, hard-line racism to bright-eyed acceptance. the flashbacks appear in black and white, a none-too-subtle nod towards the racial conflict this film deals with, as well as a contrast with the colourful present; in the past things seemed clear-cut. due to events, relationships and revelations, Derek and by extension Danny through his assignment see through the hypocrisies; it's a lot more complicated then the sheep mentality of the conflicts and societal effects involving gangs, immigrants, community and country.Derek violently killed 2 of 3 Crips who tried to rob his dad's car, enraging him to gleefully perform that brutal curb-stomp; he got 3 years. Danny goes to a party held to honour Derek's release but Derek defiantly attempts to turn his mind from the vengeful Neo-Nazism fostered by Cam, the suitably repulsive Seth etc. and onto their family, now living in a cheap apartment, struggling onwards. we are treated to flashbacks of Derek discussing social problems at dinner with a focused ferocity that underpins the misguided anger fuelling it, a store robbery he lead and his difficult time in prison, which includes an unlikely friendship with a cheeky black guy who ended up protecting him when the crew of whites that did turned away, ironically because he rejected their pseudo-Neo-Nazism, and symbolically raped him. that head-teacher came to help him, and he renounced his formerly racist ways.in the morning the police corner Derek to help them with the supremacists, which he is reluctant to do after warning Cam off the previous night, causing a standoff and an escape after which he enlightens Danny to his time in jail and his revelations. they and Danny's insightful and reflective paper are for nought as he is shot in the school toilets by the black kid he stood up to the previous day. Derek cradles him and asks 'what have i done' crying hysterically, the chain of vengeful violence perpetuated in spite of the enlightenment embraced by the Vinyards.the film only concentrates on the Neo-Nazi side of the issue, creating an imbalance realised when the Crip kids bully Francis and 'smoke' Danny for defending him. they are as aggressively and tragically misguided as the Nazis who oppose them and lament their co-existence, but a lack of focus on them creates an imbalance in the morals the film promotes. Derek is also quick to feel remorse for killing the guys who were, after all, robbing his car, one of whom would have shot him when he opened his door if he hadn't shot the guy first.the film preaches. if it's not Cam, Derek or Seth, it's the head-teacher. the messages are deceptively attractive and seemingly insightful, like when Derek pigeonholes minorities for social problems and unemployment, then destroying the store, beating up the employees, which presents the blind siege mentality of the rhetoric. it may be somewhat narcissistic that Norton edited more of himself into the film, causing the director to sue no less, but he is definitely the vehicle that drives the twisting perspective, and his fury is riveting.there is one compelling scene featuring his father reacting negatively towards his reading list, given by that head-teacher, veering from a completely acceptable and justified assertion - the black guys shouldn't have been hired ahead of the white guys who got better scores - to dangerous diatribe - conspiracy involving blacks. this bit of dialogue highlights how complicated and delicately poised the issue is, at all levels, at home, on the basketball court, school, prison, in all society.this film is as complicated as the issue it's trying to deconstruct, a memorable and ambiguous study that transcends the preaching and brutality and permeates the very direction and intentions of the film itself. it doesn't focus on the black gangs and completely ignores Hispanics, Orientals etc. besides the store attack, but this reflects how skewed the issue is.hopefully, through the poignant and genuinely painful tragedy that befalls our heartily acted protagonists, the viewer can perceive the utter pointlessness and horrific waste of the hostility from all sides that breeds the problem. if not, the viewer should watch this masterpiece again, for it is a spectacular study of the issue.",American History X
422,g_ryder,Rewrite your history for your own sake.,10,19 June 2012,"The interesting title of this movie supposedly comes from the teacher in the school (Dr Sweeney) who tells his student (Danny) to write an account of his life especially in regard to his relationship with his brother who is a Neo-Nazi Skinhead whom he idolizes and wants to follow in his footsteps. The teacher is telling Danny not to be stuck in the past of others who have made the same disastrous choices but to find for himself whether he is capable of thinking on his own rather than follow the logic and rhetoric of a gang of bigoted Nazis. By writing out his own story, Danny first revisits his past, and finally discovers through the experiences of his brother in prison that indeed he has only been following the prejudiced logic of others, a logic that is fortified into an emotional frenzy of hatred by the archaic rhetoric of people like Hitler, and in this process they have become mere pawns in a game of domination that seems to go on eternally. The whole point of the movie is that this game of domination is a lose-lose game of false or illusory honor or pride in which even the 'king' is eventually forced to commit 'hara-kiri', whereas the pawns, whether on the side of the oppressor or the side of the oppressed who react violently, are either slaughtered or lead a foolish, meaningless life of subservience or futile violent reprisals in which they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again, learning nothing from their past. So American History with the suffix X (symbolizing the unknown – that is, capable of being reinterpreted without racial prejudice) is the attempt to breakout of this vicious power game, so that something valuable can be learned from History, rather than be trapped in it. The X is also a sort of tribute to Malcolm X who renounced his racism against whites and said that the problem of race was not merely an American problem but a world problem – a problem of humanity (Dr Sweeney's story about dealing with the problem is quite similar to that of Malcolm X's transformation of attitude). This movie is an attempt to deal with this problem by pointing out that this must be dealt with fore-mostly in the educational institutions and that the teachers have a crucial role in this. If this issue is not dealt with at the school level, then it becomes extremely difficult to correct at the later stage of an individual's life as there are no existing institutions that deal with this issue of reforming racial prejudices and attitudes. The turning point in the movie comes when Dr Sweeney posits the key question regarding the problem: ""I didn't get no answers because I was asking the wrong questions. You have to ask the right questions – has anything you have done made your life better?"" Yes, everything depends upon the questions that you put to yourself and then honestly try to answer those for your own sake.

425,delbomber,Powerful and frightening,8,3 May 1999,"For every thirty worthless, big-budget, shoot-em-up action movies whose only purpose is to make a profit, there is a film such as this one.""American History X"" is one of the most effective, yet frightening, films I have ever seen.  I say frightening because it shows how impressionable young people are, and how easily they are led by someone who asserts him or herself.  The need to feel important and the need for fraternity is prevalent, showing that people are willing to do things they wouldn't normally do, just to be accepted.  Edward Furlong's character is so enamored by his older brother that he tries to emulate his entire lifestyle.  Even Ed Norton's character, Derrick, who seems to be in control, has been influenced by his prejudicial father.  It takes a stint in prison, and a friendship with a black prisoner that changes his life, for him to realize that spending all of one's time hating is wrong.This is not a movie about neo-Nazi's, although the trailers for this film made it look as if it were.  Rather it is about choices and focuses on the lives of people involved with a hate-group to get it's message across;  it shows the scary but real consequences of living such a life.I only gave this movie an 8, however, because I had some issues with the film-making that detracted from it.  The story and theme, as I have just commented on, were practically flawless, but Edward Furlong is not an actor I like to see in such an important role, and the ending was predictable. There was an abundance of flashbacks and I think more time should have been spent in the present.  These are minor complaints that are easily overlooked, but they are part of the film so I have to factor them in.I find it unfortunate that it was only released in 1200 or so theaters because of its controversial subject matter, because THIS is the type of film that should have been released ""in theaters everywhere"".",American History X

It fears nothing, not holding back for the sake of the status quo in what films are allowed to show.  And the message it sends is an important one: that hate is a terrible thing to have.The acting is stellar, in particularly by Edward Norton, whom i believe was oscar-deserving in this and is one of the best actors around.  He really plays two roles in this, and does both fantasticly.  His diction is strong, and his expressions are as well.  The look he gives his brother after murdering 2 men is the most chilling look I have seen in film.  Norton is absolutely fantastic.  Also brilliant is Avery Brooks, whose voice is tremendous.The directing and structure of this film is great.  The Black and white and the water serve as important symbols.  The story is well told and done in an original way.  It has very few flaws, in particular the overdone prison rape scene, although really graphic in this film.  Also the ending is disturbingly unresolved, although that could also work to its advantage. Overall, the film is superbly done in every way.  I highly recommend it.",American History X

It is perfect in every aspect. Resplendent story-telling with powerful performances by the cast makes this movie a class apart. Tony Kaye is superb in directing this flick as well. I don't want to write anything about the story as it was told a lot number of times. If you remember the dinner table conniption about the discussion on ""Rodney King"", I felt that I moved into that very stance. The acting was so excellent and flamboyant especially the brilliance of Norton outfoxed everybody. Furlong also played his part perfectly. This is an intense delineation of the neo-Nazi movement which affects a person's life and his entire family. The words communed by Furlong's voice says all the movie tries to convey to the audience.

428,karagoraymond,Woah !!! That was disturbing,8,18 March 2015,"Hands down the most disturbing film I have ever seen. American History X is simply outstanding.One of the film's great strengths is the great all round performance by the cast. Empire Magazine claimed that Edward Norton did not win an Oscar for his performance one of the greatest Oscar injustices of all time. And I completely agree. Some of Norton's racist monologues were so convincing they bordered on being scary. The rest of the cast did great as well. I do think, however, that they could have selected a better actor to play the younger brother, Danny, but that is a nit pick, the actor in the film did fine but I just think someone could have given a more compelling dramatic performance.Overall, what I loved most about the film was the fact that it shows racism for what it is, something that is taught, how naïve people can be led to believe anything if their circumstances call for it. The disturbing scenes where very disturbing and encapsulated the sheer lack of humanity that comes with such racist cults, such as, in this case, the Neo-Nazi's. Ultimately, American History X is not for the squeamish but it is one of the best films I have ever seen.",American History X

430,nyancatcandy,Racially loaded work of art - from a different point of view,8,1 March 2019,"American History X is the white piano note on the aspect of racism. It is true that race discrimination can be seen from different points of views. Play the white note and you hear one sound, play the black note and you hear another. Whereas Tony Kaye's masterpiece plays the white tiles, it can be said that Richard Wright's Native son plays the black one. Both stories are displaying a different perspective on the topic of racism, both do it so well, and both are oh-so-important.This film is appealing to the white crowd - the crowd that through generations have oppressed the other crowd for being less, when we are all equal human beings created together - to try and make people realize, as Derek realizes. The feature follows Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton), or rather his younger brother, Daniel (Edward Furlong) and their lives as neo Nazis and their road to redemption. It begins with Derek being released from prison, after serving 3 years for brutally killing two black criminals trying to steal his car. During his time away, Daniel, who worships Derek like a God, has followed in his footsteps and now Derek must try to keep him off that path. A different Derek came out than the one that came in, which is off-putting to Daniel as he struggles to cope with this new reality.
The motion picture is filmed alternating between colour and black and white. The part in colour standing for the present, and the black and white part for the flashbacks. They provide an acumen into Derek's life and development and there are clear connections between flashes from the past where he is seen as an innocent young boy realising the equal worth of all humans, but also the tormenting from his father to steer him onto an awful direction, and the coloured future scenes where a now salvaged Derek, who no longer is a little boy, resists the temptations of his racist friends.As for my opinion of the film, after seeing it twice, I can say nothing but that it's a masterstroke by the creators. No less credit can be given to the outstanding performances of the cast. Edward Norton keeping up with the rapid changes in his character, and Beverly D'Angelo putting on a truly devastating act. Moreover, you could argue that the film is too violent, but not according to me. The violence only helps provide the message of the film. Tony Kaye really nailed this racially loaded movie and provides for an entertaining show with a meaningful message.Whether American History X will go down in history as the neo Nazis favourite movie or a true life- changer that hits close to home for many struggling white racist people, is perhaps unnecessary to discuss. There will always be people who simply doesn't care for humanity, or anything else for that matter. What does matter, however, is that movies such as this one is not only important but a must to show to young people in particular. Even with all the violence, it shows what could happen if you go down the wrong path.",American History X
431,scoopcc,"Intriguing, well-casted movie",7,2 September 1999,"I did not see this movie until after Norton received the Oscar nomination, so my expectations were elevated somewhat (I had high standards for Norton to begin with). What I saw once I finally viewed this movie was a rather earnest look at the combination of ignorance and immaturity and how one's thinking evolves with time using a topic that will always draw definite lines: race relations. I still have trouble with the bonding of Norton and his laundry room buddy (all it took was a little 'I miss my woman' thing for Norton to let down his guard?), as it came too easily, and I have a hard time thinking that little guy was going to keep Derek out of trouble with the rest of the black prison population, but hearing Norton's dialogue and sleek casting (Ed Furlong, Fairuza Balk, and Ethan Suplee, as much as I hated his character) more than made up for the questionable bonding. The casting approval extends to the ill Beverly D'Angelo and the ""E/R""-before-George-Clooney's-ER-star Elliott Gould as the teacher.Norton was great, period. Some scenes were chilling, enough to prompt a rating of 9 out of me. The extension of the first scene later in the movie involving the curb .... that still brings flinching obscenities from my mouth.

I do think its quite good and of course its controversial, but i can't help thinking that its getting as much credit as it has for being just that. It has some good moments and the fact that the neo nazi's opinions are put a cross in a well constructed manner, rather than the usual thick headed thug type fashion does make it more uncomfortable and asked more questions of us (perhaps) and of course it has other current flowing under the obvious ones, like the element of prison and what that brings etc etc, but overall this film lacked any subtle moments. Everything is thrown infront of you in an aggressive manner, which i know people will say is the point perhaps, but in my opinion it isn't. We all know racism is a bad thing so to have it spelt out and then have the rather obvious idea of redemption but paying for your sins or for your actions (being accoutable) for your eventual loss is a little obvious",American History X
434,barrwell,Edward Norton gives Oscar-worthy performance in moving drama,9,16 September 2010,"American History X is an intense, moving film dealing with racial tension in contemporary American society. Edward Norton, in a performance that should have won an Oscar, plays Derek Vinyard over the course of several years. As the film opens we see him as the leader of a group of skinheads in LA. Later he goes to prison for murder and emerges as a changed man. We also see him as a sixteen year old (thru flashbacks), and he is amazing and memorable throughout the entire film.We find out that Derek was always intelligent and a natural leader, this is why local longtime racist and militant Cameron (Stacy Keach) has been grooming him to lead a young band of racist punks. Cameron is using Derek to fulfill some warped agenda of his, but Derek doesn't see through Cameron until its too late. After some black punks attempt to break into a car outside Dereks house, he murders one of them in a shocking and graphic scene that shows the depth of Dereks hatred and brutality.Dereks family has also been effected by racism...when Derek was 16, his firefighter father was murdered by a black junkie while on duty and he has become the man of the family and father figure to younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong). Danny is a lot like Derek, and we can just tell that he could go either way in life, but currently seems to be following Dereks lead.This is an emotionally and physically scarred family, the mother (Beverly Deangelo) smokes too much and is constantly coughing, yet still is desperately trying to hold her family together. She is seeking a man to be a father figure to Derek and starts dating a Jewish teacher (Elliot Gould). In possibly the best scene in the film (at least the most thought provoking), Goulds' character and Derek get into a political debate at the dinner table that soon gets out of control. Its an amazing scene and brilliantly acted, this is a scene every American should watch as topics are discussed that most films just don't have the courage to explore. In a way It's like the quintessential left vs right debate over racial issues, but we are also left thinking that Derek, while making some real points, can not discuss these points without ultimately showing his racial hatred and turning violent....he's been programmed by his hatred.The film moves on to Dereks prison years, I wont divulge details here, but this is the period that changes Derek immensely. He eventually opens up to a black fellow inmate with whom he becomes friends, and as events play out we see the ultimate irony occur which results in a changed Derek.The final act of the film gives us a reformed Derek (with a full head of hair) released from prison and trying to start over. When he gets home he finds his brother Danny has been in contact with Cameron and tries to intervene. Danny is a becoming a mirror image of what Derek once was and Derek must act to stop him. Any more at this point would be a spoiler but I will add a few more thoughts...In the flashbacks to Derek at age 16 we see that despite all the outside influences that developed his hatred....originally it may have came right from his own home. Nobody is born a racist, racism is taught...I think that is one of the points the film-makers wanted to make.This a shattering, heartbreaking film....a true masterpiece in the realm of social drama. The quote at the end from a speech by Abe Lincon is very fitting. This is an American classic that every American should see at least once.Also, I really was pleasantly surprised to see this film rated so highly at IMDb, not that it doesn't deserve it because it does. This is rated higher here than many very very good films....but I wanted to add my 2 cents worth anyway...",American History X
435,selenedm999,***spoilers contained***couldn't it have ended five minutes earlier?,8,10 July 2007,"American History X is a brutal and moving portrayal of racism in late-20th century America. At first, it seems balanced and intelligent, which makes it all the more tragic. This leads a viewer to feel uncomfortable--on the surface, it seems to bring out questions of one's own views on racism, but on repeated viewings, I figured out why it left a bad taste in my mouth. First the good: American History X is beautifully shot, with a grace that few movies achieve. Tony Kaye's background as a director and cinematographer is in music videos, but instead of quick edits and jarring effects to build tension, he uses light and textures, and often slows moments of impact so that even the most brutal scenes become a sort of ballet of forms. In addition to powerful performances by the film's leads, Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, who are two of the best actors of the 1990s, the supporting cast brings depth and subtlety to even the smallest roles. Standouts include Stacy Keach as a White Supremacist leader, Beverly D'Angelo as a frustrated but loving single mother, and my favourite of the group, Elliott Gould as a Jewish high school history teacher, who acts as a catalyst for a couple of small, important moments in the action. Gould's performance is completely heartbreaking during one scene, where he says nothing for several minutes, but the sadness on his face says everything: ""Where did everyone go wrong?"" This is the important question, and the film works hard to show the White Supremacists as a group of frustrated, angry kids who have been led to this point through the leader's exploitation. In fact, they're realistic enough that they reminded me of several of the guys I knew in high school, who were, like Derek Vinyard, so smart and informed about politics that you wondered what they could achieve if they used their powers for good. Through the narrative, we see Vinyard transform from an angry kid with something to prove into a complicated adult, who learns lessons about compassion and consequence, and tries to show them to his brother Daniel.****SPOILERS BELOW***Unfortunately, they should have left it at that. The film fails for two reasons. The first is that the death of a major character at the end of the film, for no good reason, to me says that the writer didn't know how to end the story, and I consider this a weakness. The movie seems to be saying that violence begets violence, however, violence is usually the end result of a set of circumstances. While the film tries hard to achieve a balance that shows all the characters, white and non-white, as being well rounded, with both positive and negative qualities, I think it fails most of its Young Black Male characters. The second reason the film fails is that by having Danny die as the result of race-related gang violence, the message of the movie underscores what the ""bad"" White Supremacists have been saying all along: Blacks are the scourge of the community the White gangs are trying to protect, and violence is a way of life for ""those people."" That's the true tragedy. It's bad enough that gangs ARE a source of identity and culture, and that so many young men live such a violent existence, but American History X perpetuates the same tired stereotypes. Will Hollywood ever break free of this? Somehow I doubt it--if nothing else, it sells. Whatever your views on racism, whatever side of that line you're on, American History X is still a gripping movie, despite its flaws. It will stay with you for a long, long time.",American History X

Things like the excessive use of slow motion and the overbearing score. Also, the easy conversion of the main character while in jail rings false.However on this latest viewing I found the film's glorification of violence particularly disturbing especially because of how it is framed by the director. There seems to be a relishing of the violence. Every minority in the film is to be blamed thus the violence justifies for being a gang member or for hiring illegal aliens while the white characters are allowed to be just run of the mill humans.The only thing that saves this film is Edward Norton's performance despite having a weak script to work with.",American History X

441,Member,The Klansmen,1,17 September 2003,"****Spoilers*****AHX begins and ends with violence committed by the African-Americans against the white people, mainly the neo-nazis of the film. IMO this creates a kind of frame for this film that got me thinking about another film with similar narrative and semantic problems. The D.W. Griffith film The Birth of Nation, aka. The Klansmen came to my mind and back when that film was made there really was racism around, and guess what, there still is. Everyone remembers the glorious battle scenes of Griffiths' film but how many remember the horribly racistic depiction of african american slaves portrayed in that film.To me AHX suffers from the same symptom, trying to tell an epic story of some type but ultimately succumbing to racism because they simply hadn't done enough thinking about the subject matter that they had chosen. I really despise people who take everything that comes out of Hollywood as some kind of gospel that has to be studied and deified, IMO if it smacks of racism it's good to keep a distance to it. This film fails to say anything substancial about racism, it only succeeds in introducing the subject but it is as if the audience is being left waiting for a sequel, not because the original was so good but because the original failed to tell a good and complete story. And believe me, I have personally witnessed enough racism to know that one can easily make a really gripping and thoughtful film about racism, even without resorting to shock-tactics such as this film does.
This film reminds me of that tv-series Oz that tries so very hard to be 'topical' and 'philosophical' and 'gritty and in-your-face realistic' but fails to do any of them. Both, Oz and this film, only succeed in being a kind of soap opera that caters to the sick minds of the ones with an appetite for violence. Violence does not a story make.",American History X

'American History X' creates its characters through a series of black and white flashbacks that are narrated by Derek's impressionable younger brother Daniel, played by Edward Furlong. Daniel, who has witnessed his brothers violent threshold reach its fiery peak, has also decided to brand African Americans as enemy no.1. but hasn't suffered the consequences of his sibling idol as Derek's reign as racist leader lands him in jail for murder. Unlike Derek, Daniel has the opportunity to exit the world of white supremacy before it's too late as he sees Derek surprisingly turn his back on the nazi cult he helped create and ride a road to reform and regret. Director Tony Kaye has made a movie of relentless force and brutal vulnerability, a bold, aggressive and confronting vision that few young film makers fail to achieve.

Honestly, I think it is one of the top 5 performances of the 90s.The content is a mixed bag.  I thought this film would be idiotic, but in fact, it does succeed in addressing a number of issues (from immigration to affirmative action) in such a way as to illustrate how a reasonably intelligent adolescent could be lured into the Neo-Nazi movement.  Still, there's almost an implication that anyone who doesn't support affirmative action or who does support tougher immigration laws is one step away from being a through and through bigot.  There are indeed shades of gray that exist between black and white.  American History X fails to find these shades, and instead rests comfortably in extremes.Oh yeah, the violence is pretty graphic.  If you're a pansy about that sort of thing, you may not be able to stomach it.  I think it's done responsibly and to great effect.In short, see this film.  Take it with a grain of salt, but see it.

He lost to the tour de force performance of Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". Whether Norton deserved it over Benigni (I hope that is the right spelling) is a question worth debating, both were career-making performances. I think that Norton probably deserved it a little more for 2 reasons: 1. He plays COMPLETELY against type. You can not believe that this is the same relatively tame Edward Norton who won so many people over in such movies as Rounders and the People Vs. Larry Flynt. Rarely are there such acting transformations. 2. Norton carried the movie. The direction was somewhat sloppy, the script had a couple holes here and there, and besides Furlong's convincing peformance as an impressionable youth, the acting is only so-so. But Norton was solid, convincingly ranting and raving and recruiting. The slow transformation of Furlong's character into a neo-nazi under Norton's influence and then the transformation back to tolerance truly exemplifies how the Nazi movement could have spread through Germany over 60 years ago.

If, however, you already know most or all of the above, you might get bored, or marvel at what a remarkably ""clean"" movie was made out of such an inherently ugly subject. Sure, the two strayed heroes have their dark sides but both of them, when they're not doing their white-supremacist gang thing, are mostly mild-mannered, well-behaved, polite kids you'd love to have baby-sit your daughter. It's no wonder then, that this dark side is so easily dropped by both at once - it didn't stick in the first place.

452,thetruth45,Good...BUT,7,26 June 2008,"This is a good movie. There is one glaring flaw that everyone fails to mention. This guy is the ultimate racist right? So how come he decides he is going to reform just because he gets raped by a white supremacist? What does some scummy Nazi guy raping him have anything to do with him realizing that racism is wrong? I mean really it doesn't make any sense. He is sitting there, in prison, telling his white supremacist jail friends what scumbags they are for mixing with other races (i.e. he thinks that whites shouldn't mix with any other race at all and his jail friends aren't so extreme). He doesn't respect their opinion in the first place because they aren't hardcore racists like him, so logically it makes zero sense that these people, who he doesn't respect, would have any influence on his racist beliefs. In fact, you would think it would make him more racist.If you can ignore the fact that his choice to reform is based solely on him being raped then it's an awesome movie.",American History X
453,andrewtowne-1,"To get this movie, you have to read between the lines",10,25 June 2008,"On the surface, American History X is a preachy movie that tells us racism is bad. But the details of the movie undercut the preachiness and show that life is a bit more complicated than that. We see why the white kids become racist against non-whites. First, their police officer Dad gets passed over for promotion in his job because he is white, and non-whites are favored over whites under the department's affirmative action policy. Next, the beach town where they live is becoming integrated, and some white kids are beaten up by non-white kids. To defend themselves, they form a gang to counter the gangs of blacks and Latinos that have moved into their traditionally white neighborhood and schools. Next, Derek, the neo-Nazi leader, complains about the fact that new non-white immigrants (both legal and illegal) are coming into their town, taking jobs away from unskilled whites, not assimilating into American culture, and getting government benefits not available to whites. Last, there is racism directed at whites by some of the non-whites. The question this movie poses is an important one: Can we be honest about the fact that what I have just talked about is going on (too many in our society deny all these things, or pretend they are not important), but still look at people as individuals and not pre-judge them on the basis of race? Derek, the neo-Nazi leader, eventually meets a black inmate in prison who wins Derek over with his sense of humor. It turns out that the black is protecting Derek from other blacks and Latinos after Derek loses the protection of his neo-Nazi buddies because of a dispute between them. Where the movie fails in my view (and of course, this view will be seen by many as politically incorrect) is in its transformation of Derek into someone who is now against racism simply because he made a black friend and may owe his life to that friend. There is no good reason to believe that Derek's new-found ability to not pre-judge a person on the basis of that person's race means that he still doesn't believe that non-whites in general are being unfairly favored over whites in our society. I myself object to the entire social discourse on race in our society today. It would be one thing if we had truly moved beyond judging people ""by the color of their skin instead of the content of their character,"" but our ""enlightened"" society today never forgets the color of people's skin. The difference between now and the time when Dr. King spoke is that today our society rewards people for being a certain race at the expense of people of another race. And so we never move beyond race to looking at people as individuals and rewarding them based on their character and efforts.Many argue that we need to go through this period of racial favoritism in order to level a playing field that favored whites in the past, and still favors many whites today. Perhaps. But those who make this argument must be prepared for the consequences that result when people lose out on opportunities they would otherwise enjoy. The Dereks of this world are not a figment of some screen-writer's imagination. And they did not create the problem that society now asks them to solve by putting their dreams on hold. I would be more inclined to support this leveling of the playing field if everyone shared in the burden. For example, the white leaders and politicians who support racial favoritism. Why do they never step aside and offer their own jobs, positions and money to non-whites? It is ironic that, in a supposed attempt to create social justice, only middle class and poor whites are expected to make the necessary sacrifices.Perhaps the makers of American History X were inclined -- somewhat -- to agree with me because the movie ends with the brutal and apparently unprovoked murder of Derek's white brother by a black. The movie thus subverts its own message that everything will be just hunky-dory if the neo-Nazis just forget about their grievances over race and -- indeed -- recognize that there was no foundation for those grievances in the first place. Could this ambiguity in the movie have something to do with the disagreement between the star and the director? That is the question the movie left me with. Anyway, it is a superb movie in terms of acting, cinematography, and so on, and is well worth watching.",American History X
454,Castor-10,Brilliant work,10,7 December 1998,"I've seen this movie 3 times now and it is one of the most brilliant and (by far) the most controversial film I have ever seen.  Edward Nortan should get an oscar for his performance in this picture.  I am curious of whether or not we will ever see the directors final cut when this movie comes out on video, I have a feeling some parts of the movie (the ending would be the first to come to mind, and maybe more to deal with the two black men Nortan killed) were better explained or had more meaning in his version.  But don't get me wrong, this is an outstanding piece of work and for those who give themselves the chance to see it will be talking about it long after they see it.

455,Predator-11,A powerful and brutally honest film about racism in the United States.,10,25 October 2000,"American History X is by far one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. It stuck with me for days after the first time I watched it. The story is fairly simple. A highly respected Neo-Nazi named Darek gets out of prison and attempts to mend the damages done to his family by his hate-filled life. It's told through a mix of Darek's younger brother recalling the events leading to his arrest (in black and white) and current events just after his release (in color).Edward Norton gives a fantastic and moving performance as Darek. This is one of those movies where the actor get's so into the role that you completely forget you're watching a movie. In the flashback scenes he spouts extremely powerful dialog in a manner that will make you think he just thought of it on the spot. And in the present scenes he gives an emotionally moving performance as a loving brother. Norton was absolutly robbed of the best actor Oscar.The story is incredibly touching and honest, with scenes that will arise dozens of emotions in you. The manner in which the story unfolds is executed perfectly, cutting you off part way into the plot, but never leaving you confused or uptight. Each moment is just as interresting as the last. The ending leaves you with so much to think about that you'll want to see it again, just to make sure you took everything in.I recommend American History X to anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll warn that the violence and intense, and sometimes angering subject matter might be too much for some. But since the film was obviously meant to be realistic, it succeeds in every aspect. I give American History X a perfect 10 stars out of 10.",American History X

457,eric20other2002,Top Rate Acting in this Incredible and Necessary look at life in America,10,8 May 2013,"It took me a long time to watch this film, the nature of racism and bigotry is nothing new to anyone, its all around us and sadly will always be there, whether its against Black people, white people or any other ace, its unavoidable. What this film does is amazing, it takes you through one man's journey from a young man, whose outlook on life is like any other at a young age, to someone whose hate is fueled by the unfortunate death of a loved onto him trying to save another loved one to a similar fate. Each and every performance is significant, from the small, but effective roles portrayed by Fairuza Balk and Ethan Suplee, as members of the DOS that Norton's character at the start of the film has brought together, as kind of a new age Nazi regime. The two performances in the film to really look at here goes to Norton and Furlong themselves, the characters are both shown to be bright individuals despite their obvious ignorance and as we get to know them, we begin to really want them to succeed in a turn around. Of course, with Norton's character we see him already changed, trying to put the pieces of his family back together, due to his actions in the past and its through flashbacks we get to see his turnaround. Another performance that should thrown out there is by Guy Torry, who plays Norton's cell mate of sorts(they don't share a cell, but they have the same work duty), his character is likable and he manages to make you feel like your there in the film helping him to turn Norton around. The main focus of the movie starts out with Furlong's character on the verge of becoming the hateful clone that his brother was locked up for going too far with, while we see him as a caring member of the family, its hard to see his ignorance come out, simply due to skin color and feeling that society is now so focused on being equal they are screwing over the white race, which as a white person living in the projects, I can relate(although, I don't grow any hate over it). Edward Furlong does a phenomenal job in this film, although, they look nothing alike, you really feel they were brothers with a tight bond. Another aspect of the film that really sends a great message is how the story the told in present time, with the flashbacks being told in black & white, it keeps the film feeling surreal, while still giving you the message the scene is trying to get out, with the most effective scene coming in the form of what ultimately got Norton landed in jail and what Furlong is thinking of when he finally has his turnaround. Although, I put in that there are spoilers in this review, I think its best you watch this film to see how the ending plays out, its an unexpected and very non-cliché. One that will have you watching through the credits as you wrap your mind around what you just watched. 5 out of 5 stars I will also have to note that this film has never gotten a decent DVD release, no commentary, no featurettes, nothing. The studio needs to wake up and give us something like that.",American History X

Oh yeah, in this one seen at the dinner table, his mother is like dating a jewish guy and Edward just gets crazy and yells at him because he is pro anti-semitism a.k.a he is jewish. He tells him that he is ""poisoning his families dinner with his jewish ni**** loving hippy bullsh**"" then he tells him to get the fu** out of his house. That part is hysterical.

460,curtman2,"A Searing Blow to the Face, A Cultural Cornerstone",10,2 February 2005,"""American History X"" is one of the most graphic, brutally honest, harrowing, and challenging films you'll ever get to experience. Period. Featuring Edward Norton as a reformed Neo-Nazi, immersed into an endless cycle of hate and just released from prison with a dire awakening for tolerance, this is a study that doesn't question its subjects' animosities and hostilities as much as it delves into their world, consumed by social depravity and intolerance towards all, endeavoring wherever and whenever they might simply to promote white supremacy across America. The narrative is Derek Vinyard (Norton)'s younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), who is assigned, nay, obligated, to write a paper detailing his influence Derek's path to social degradation so that he might better understand how to grip with his embedded anger and perhaps relinquish it. There's nothing pretty about this harrowing and powerful story, yet it demands to be hearkened: it's brutal and incendiary, taking us deep inside a culture of hate, and having us understand the roots of the subjects' animosities. It's timeless and timely, unequivocal and unflinching, and it is about as uncompromising as a series of dour blows to the face, and then some. Watching this incredibly potent and brutally honest study of the roots, repercussions, and reformations of a culture of hate is a transformation of reckoning: its tone is dark (manifested in black and white cinematography), and whatever message that is trying to be conveyed, it is sincere, yet not entirely hopeful. Edward Norton is astoundingly human, in encompassing the chastity, and evoking the chilling menace of deep-seated abomination. This is one of the most powerful human studies I have ever endured: it is intent on tackling the most consuming quality of man in examining its sources and its brutal extent of barbarity and inhumanity, even showing us that hate and prejudice is so powerful it can collapse even the dearest relations. The plot is structured scatalogically rather than chronologically, so that multiple themes can be examined at once, never settling for the here and now, but rather than the then and now to advance its themes and an understanding of its subjects' plighted deviances. In conclusion, one can hardly excoriate ""Histoy"" for exonerating Derek, Danny, and their Neo-Nazi cults, but rather, the film barrages the culture of hate, wherever and however it exists, because in the end, it squanders even the brightest potentials (e.g. Derek) and makes enemies of us all. The ending is exceedingly disturbing for me, as it virtually contradicts some critical and seemingly discernible themes developed throughout the film, of acceptance and tolerance through brutal reformation. Perhaps the message that Kaye is trying to elicit is that the cycle of hate perpetuates throughout cultures, and consumes and ultimately destroys its subjects. ""American History X"" is a contemporary cornerstone for cultures everywhere, that will only re assuredly resonate through time. **** out of ****",American History X
461,Linda-21,I wish it would have been better,6,6 December 1998,"Edward Norton's performance was great.  He is a fine actor who has a natural mastery of difficult roles and made me feel that he actually WAS the skinhead he portrayed.Southern California is a hotbed of racial tension and it's time that someone finally was willing to deal with this problem in a film.Ed Norton plays the role of a skinhead who has a change of attitude while in prison and then tries to keep his younger brother from following in his footsteps.  There's lots of brutality and violence.  And lots of excellent directing.  Flashbacks are in black and white.  There are good uses of slow motion and cuts.  But not every performance was as stellar as Norton's, and there was way too much psycho-babble instead of some thought-provoking scenes.

462,Aidy,"Powerful, pointless",9,30 March 1999,"I'd like to start by saying that this is a fantastic movie that you should go and see.  It is gripping 100% of the way through.  The acting is superb, the imagery is breathtaking, the violence is thoroughly brutal.However I did have some gripes about the actual intent of the movie.  The story follows the lives of Derek (Edward Notron) and Danny (Edward Furlong) Vinyard.  Danny, the younger brother of Derek, is instructed to study the life of his brother after he submits a paper on Mein Kampf for school. Danny looks up to and admires his brother and they are both neo-Nazis. Derek ends up in prison after a race related manslaughter, yet his time in prison shows him the error of his ways and after release he attempts to reform his younger brother as he himself has been reformed.The first part of the movie explores Derek as a character and his white power motivation and ideas.  Derek is not your stereotypical thug.  He is intelligent and articulate.  The whole first section presents both racism against whites and racism against blacks.  Both black and white are seen to be equally discriminatory and violent, a war of two equal sides.  Yet we only ever see the motives of the neo-Nazis.  We are given the propaganda that the neo-Nazis feed on, social problems are dredged up and the blacks and immigrants are blamed for all of it and Derek is Hell-bent on putting those wrongs right.  Apart from the awful violence there are no strong reasons given why Derek is in any way 'wrong.'  We have no real reason to hate or despise him, after all the men he killed were trying to kill him. His father was killed by black people as he tried to save their lives. This whole idea prevails...both 'sides' are 'wrong' yet both are justifiedIn prison, however, Derek becomes disillusioned with his 'own kind' and turns from them realising they have shallow motives and are unguided.  He feels the thugs in prison don't share his ideas; they are simply thugs. He decides to become a loner, neither friends with the white gang or the black gang.  This leaves him wide open as to even survive you have to take at least one side.  The only reason he makes it out alive is due to a friendship he develops with a black inmate.This is the rather flimsy basis of his conversion.  Separated from everyone he begins to realise that he has been fed a lie and vows to distance himself from his former gang lifestyle.It is all-well and good seeing that Derek is no longer a racist thug...but what about all of the white-power ideas?  All of the social problems that Derek points out still exist in society.  Nothing he says throughout the movie is rebutted.  So neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.Another interesting point was the cinema dynamics.  I can't remember any other movie where I have squirmed in my seat, practically ashamed to be white.  Half way through the movie I was praying that all would turn out good lest I be lynched outside...it really is that powerful.  However as both black and white exchanged words onscreen I squirmed as 'my race' demonstrated their racism toward the blacks, yet the black members of the audience felt it acceptable to laugh out loud as the onscreen blacks were racist toward the whites...So I would like to finish by saying that not only was I practically ashamed of being white, I am proud to say that at least I was ashamed.",American History X
463,Mike-469,Good but too Short,8,1 July 1999,"This was one of those films that needs to be about an hour longer -- both because it is so good and because it skims the surface of so many of its' plot points.  For example, the prison scenes needed to be longer and more in depth.  One whole year of Derek's sentence is covered in just a few minutes! Nonetheless, this movie had a powerful and moving message that will not soon be forgotten.Other than that, though, this was a very good and disturbing movie.  It was nicely shot, with good use of color, camera angle, close-ups, etc.  All of the actors do a good job as well, especially the two leading roles.  I recommend it highly, although if the director ever comes out with an expanded version, it would improve the film immeasurably.One other thing -- I have to say that I think the movie unfairly (and maybe unconsciously?) labels anyone who is against affirmative action and immigration control as a right-wing racist or even a skinhead.

This movie was by no means predictable like the other 99% of movies that Hollywood comes out with. For once, it seemed as though the director and the writer of the script put serious thought into this one.The acting was incredible! I can't stress that enough, especially Edward Norton. I always depicted him to be a weak, nice guy. Not here. He completely surprised me, and in a pleasant way. He depicts the evil side of the human race with a very close resemblance, if not identical. His change from hate to love was also amazing, one which I haven't seen an actor do in a long time. I seriously cannot find any flaws in the cast. Everyone fits their roles perfectly.If you have not watched this movie, I strongly urge you to watch it, in fact, I beg you to go watch it. This movie does a great job in simultaneously portraying racism in its rawest and most complete form. I must warn, however, that it's a very strong movie, but at the same time represents our modern society perfectly, and it is this latter aspect that makes the film a drop-dead gorgeous masterpiece (I know, it's redundant, but that's how good this movie is).

468,cinna665,One of the most powerful movies I've ever seen!,10,22 December 2005,"American History X is a story of two brothers - Derek and Danny Vinyard (Edwards Norton and Furlong) - who believe in White Power, and they belong to a Neo-Nazi movement where people think if you are not ""white protestant"", you're not worth anything. When three black guys try to steal Derek's car, Derek freaks out and kills two of the thieves and goes to jail where he is forced to see the other side of things. ""In here, you the nigga. Not me"" tells Derek's working partner in the prison.American History X is probably the most powerful movie I've ever seen. The way two stories - current day in colour and past events in black&white - are told in a parallel way is very beautiful, implicating how things in the past were so simple, so black and white, whereas in reality they are much more complex. The story is very strong and wakes up strong feelings in the viewer, but towards the end gives also hope and vision of a brighter future. As the little brother Danny puts it: ""Hate is a baggage. Life's too short to be p****d off all the time. It's not worth it"".Edward Norton got Oscar -nominated for his role as the skinhead Derek Vinyard. And I don't question that nomination a bit! He is just awesome as first the hateful, self confident skinhead, then confused and sad man, questioning things and in the latter part a strong father figure for his little brother. The growth story of Derek is brilliantly made, a very powerful role for Norton who delivers his performance flawlessly. It is also amazing to see the transformation of otherwise a bit skinny baby-faced Norton to this muscular, tough guy skinhead.Edward Furlong as little brother Danny plays a beautiful role as well. Grown up in the shadow of his brother he is the sweet big-eyed little brother everyone wants to protect. Furlong fits into his role 100%.American History X jumped directly to the top 10 of my all time favourite movies. After watching this two times during the weekend, I can still feel the movie in me after so many days. Not many films make that kind of lasting impact.

469,drewconnor,We are not enemies,10,4 December 2013,"This is the only film i have seen which really tackles racism in a realistic and intelligent way. The Ed Norton character is an intelligent and articulate individual who convincingly preaches the twisted logic of racism. The film manages to convey most psychological explanations of racism - the authoritarian personality,the scapegoat hypothesis, in-group out-group bias, transference, etc, without feeling preachy. I can't think of a more socially important or responsible film than this. Derek's emotional oddessy is both moving and disturbing, with all points of view given equal airing, no matter how extreme. Personally I found the question asked of Derek 'Has anything you have done made your life better?' a stark and penetrating wake up call for anyone who is unhappy. The ending has been criticised for being overly emotional but I thought it was appropriate, Derek gets hurt by former chosen enemies who have not yet learnt the lesson he has. This makes us question whether Derek was wrong in the first place. This is a complicated film about a difficult subject which should be required viewing in all schools. The ultimate message is to do your best and try to get along with other people. Its not just about racism, its about personal choice, do we live to hate or do we try to make life better for ourselves and others. The director walked away from the film, my question is if he was unhappy with this cut, what would his version be like? This version is a technical, artistic and emotional triumph.",American History X
470,rosaishere,Norton's acting delivers the sheer loss that racism can truly bring,8,9 June 2006,"Probably one of the most powerful films I have ever seen, with a subject matter that is so delicate and easily could have been mishandled  this film delivers a performance of a lifetime from Edward Norton and a superb story shaping the influences around him.The film is told in two tales; one in black and white, conveying the wrongful doings of Derek Vinyard (Norton) and about how his racial crusades slowly infiltrate the mind of his little brother. After a brutal racially motivated murder of three individuals for breaking into his car, Derek is sent to jail where he soon learns the errors of his ways and comes to realise the pain and suffering he has caused.The second story told in colour, runs parallel to that of the past of Derek. This story focuses more on Danny Vinyard, and about the effect his brother has on him. After handing in a paper on Mein Kampf, the school's headmaster orders Danny to write a paper about his brother. This is where we hear the vocal expressions of the effects that he has had on him through a well delivered voice-over. On the same day when Danny is reunited with his brother, Danny sets about trying to impress his brother by taking up where he left off  the tattoos, the haircut, the attitude  aspiring to him. But as Derek's story develops from his time in prison, you begin to realise that he cannot let his brother take the same path as he did. He disowns all his friends and connections in the neo-Nazi party in a ditch attempt to save his brother from a similar life of destruction and mayhem. The relationship between the two brothers is what drives the plot of the film; the acting between them is impeccable and emotionally driven. As Danny finally realises what his brother is trying to teach him, he is shot by a gang member that he encountered before his brother showed him the right path. Derek holding his dead brother in his arms is the greatest lesson of all. Norton conveys with such passion, the pain, the guilt and true regret the character is feeling his brother's death was his entire fault. Without a doubt one of the most powerful films you will see, and I can't help but feel that under all this there is a powerful message that mankind is twisted and troubled in today's society over such petty issues as race and equality which could so easily be dealt with by the governments in place.",American History X
471,buseoana,one of the best movies out there!,10,26 February 2006,"this movie is really brain damaging! it will keep blocking your mind the entire day after you've seen it! it is so powerful and abundant in contradictory conceptions on very delicate things that it will put you both in the pro and in the con category. it says things that are extremely true and it tries to show in the end that, no matter how revolted and enraged you are, you just can't do much and things are not so simple. it's in a way an analysis of the system and the discrimination and crimes of the so called 'democracy' and 'human rights' characteristics of our world. it really shows you how humans think under good leadership and how easily our minds change after personal experience and how our mistakes are always payed back in full. it shows the bad parts of being and thinking extreme, like the Nazism conception, and also the bad things of supporting a democratic society. it is a true masterpiece, a movie that makes you think a lot about things that you considered or taught that they are horribly wrong and makes you realize that things are not as simple as you thought!",American History X

Unlike some other movies on this subject, American History refrains from becoming a one-sided racial editorial. We are presented with a character whose situations lead him to a bad choice. That choice is not excused, but rather held up as an example. Sadly there is a lot of hate in America that needs to be addressed. This movie is a compelling look. Norton is impressive in the lead role, and Avery Brooks also gives a great performance.",American History X

It is absolutely not a film for those who go to the movies just for fun; it is, in fact, for those who see art as an object of reflection about our world, ourselves and our lives. It is a motion picture in which the image says more than a thousand words, concerning a serious and real drama that affects not only the America but the whole world: the prejudice, one of the most irrational attitudes of human kind; proving that some legacies must end. It is even better due to the remarkable performance of Edward Norton as the former neo-nazi skinhead Derek Vinyard.

475,jefflittle19,Fascinating Film,9,21 June 2003,American History X is a fascinating film that I would recommend everyone watch. The basic storyline is ordinary however the way it plays out is extraordinary. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong really poured their hearts into this film and it shows. They are magnificent in the lead roles. Tony Kaye really directed this well and the film should be mandatory viewing for every white supremist. It may change the way some of them perceive things.My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five),American History X
476,jayjay21718,It's not great but ok potential was there.,6,28 September 2021,Got to say very disappointed. Been meaning to watch this film since 2007 maybe event sooner. Since always heard good things about it. So finally. Had an opportunity to see this movie unedited un censored 14 years later. So was the movie filmed nicely. Sure. In sure most of it was filmed slightly backwards since. They go form long hair to medium to short hair. So a lot of thought was put into the scenes film order etc. All the characters did a great job acting. I will give them that. For sure. So filmed great. Acting great. What was weak is the story line. So what the dad the firefighter complains he has less then perfect coworkers due to race. So he then what hate them tells his son. And then after he dies I guess he meets that other guy and he starts to hate immigrants. But to attack the grocery story like that so extreme. But. Not as extreme as the black guys attacking his home since they can't play on the basket ball court. Then he curb stomping him since his dad gave him the truck. Then for him to only get three years in jail. Wth. Then they never explained the deal that was being made in the prison. But I guess since he played basket ball with them gives them a reason to rape him. Since he blew them off. And the black guy to help him not be murderer not sure if that's enough to make him a pacifist. Same with the brother yeah he was disrespectful and blew smoke in his face so you shoot him. Did he even get caught what happened with the group like there were lose ends that weren't tied up. Really Think it could of been great but there was a lot more improvements. That should of been made.,American History X

As a viewer the close ups became very erratic. It ignored decent portraits and landscapes. Tony Kaye's cinematography looked flat instead of mind blowing. Tony Kaye's directing did not look professional. In addition, the plot was down the drain for me because it only explored a very tiny piece of the racial subject matter. David Mckenna's screenplay was absolutely preachy. It did not let the audience have access to their perspectives. In my thoughts, it made the characters behave like puppets instead of organic. Derek Vinyard behaved more like a puppet being pulled by its master than any other normal human being. I hardly felt anything from the storyline because of the lack of depth. I could not empathize with the plot at all. To add, Ann Dudley written down beautiful notes for his orchestra to perform. His composed tunes trapped my ears from beginning to end.

479,Bandit1974,Has Anything You've Done Made Your Life Better?,10,3 January 2007,"Asks Bob Sweeney, a former high school teacher of our main character, Derek Vinyard.Derek is a white male who was brought up in a white middle class family and neighborhood. Derek is also the local poster boy for the skinhead white supremacists. Derek is evil personified.At the start of our story we learn that Derek has been convicted of two brutal murders. He has just been released from prison after serving a little more than three years. All of Derek's disciples, including his younger brother, Danny, have been waiting for this day to come. They've been waiting for the return of their hero.Derek has other plans, though. Three years and one prison rape gave Derek enough time and reason to rethink everything he once believed to be true. With the help of his former high school teacher turned mentor, Derek now fully understands the emptiness of his former beliefs. Derek simply wants a second chance at life, but it won't be that easy. Danny worships Derek and is stunned at his change in attitude. Not only will Derek have to remove himself from the life he once lead, he will now also have to remove his brother Danny. A task that proves to be much more difficult than it sounds.Any movie covering the topic of racism is typically difficult to digest, especially when its portrayal is as honest as American History X. As the viewer we get to see it all from the brutal hate crime that landed Derek in jail to the irrational beliefs that fueled his rage. It's not an easy movie to sit through, but well worth it.I have often felt that American History X could be used in high school to educate students about racism. It would take an incredibly talented instructor to tackle the subject using this movie as a tool because many people that harbor racist beliefs depicted in X may view Derek as a hero for all the wrong reasons. I say this because I have personally talked to people who ""like"" this movie for all the wrong reasons.X does an excellent job of portraying the pent up anger and frustration of white middle class males that typically leads to these sort of beliefs. Even better, X shows that racism usually starts in the home. Derek adopted his beliefs from his father and were, in his mind, only justified when his father (a fireman) was killed in an all black neighborhood while attempting to do his job.X brings up many social arguments including border control laws and the demographics of prison populations. The movie doesn't attempt to address those issues from a solution standpoint, rather it suggests that if we continue to use examples of societies problems such as these to justify our hate and unhappiness than we are only that much further from becoming happy.The movie is an honest look at an ugly part of our society. I think the movie does a superb job of portraying the story and issues without preaching to the viewer. That being said, it's impossible for an educated viewer not to see the flaws in the views that lead to Derek's hate crime.I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone with the caveat that at times it can be uncomfortable to watch. I'd also add that if you are a fan of Edward Norton his performance was Oscar worthy.",American History X
480,the rock-17,i don't think i've seen a better movie,10,30 August 1999,"After I watched this movie, I could only say one thing: wow.  I think that this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life.  Not only did Edward Norton deserve by far that Academy Award nod for this movie, I am surprised that Edward Furlong, who played Danny, Derek's (Norton) younger brother, didn't get a nomination as well.  I am also dissapointed in the Academy for not putting this down as a contender for Best Picture of the year.  I have seen all five of the nominees for this past year, and sure I agree with Life Is Beautiful, The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan, and even Shakespeare in Love, but American History X could have easily taken the place of Elizabeth.  This movie was great.  The ending was sad, the acting was more-than-phenomenal, the direction was excellent, all of the scenes were gripping (especially when Derek was being arrested after killing a black man.  I still get chills down my spine when I think of that scene, with him smiling and then noticing his younger brother, and suddenly his whole facial expression changes in an instant).  I own this movie on DVD, and I've seen it three times.  Even my mom, who doesn't like any movies, watched this and was stunned.  She's seen it twice.  This is a great example of cinematic masterpiece that everyone should watch at least once.  My grade: A+",American History X
481,chasman99,"Provoking, violent and not sugar coated",10,11 August 2004,"To those who say the movie is poorly done, maybe you should sit down and watch the movie again.  Edward Norton is an amazingly imposing figure. During the scene where he gets arrested that so many people allude to, he raises his hands and turns around, tattoos showing and a smile so evil you want to puke.  He has zero remorse.  How he got to be this way is somewhat inconsequential but his father's death and political views on being passed over for a job are the root of that problem.  His control lover the household, and his younger brother is amazing.Once in prison he realizes that everything is not as he was lead to believe. The white supremacists that he meets are completely different than what he expects.  Norton has actually bought into the true image and cause of white supremacy.  When he finds out that is not at the heart of the movement he changes forever.  Having a black friend in the slammer and being raped didn't exactly help him to love his ""white brothers""Upon release he feverishly begins the efforts to change the fortunes of his family for good.  The ending is sad, but it gives the movie something most do not have in Hollywood, realism.  not everyone forgets.A fabulous movie, and one that is not for the weak of stomach.  violent, racial, angry and profane.  But well done.One last note: many people make comments about the dinner table scene with Elliott Gould.  To me this is a fantastic scene where the one person you know you are supposed to disagree with (Norton) says some things that actually make sense.

It's intense and for the most part riveting. It's high rating on IMDb is well deserved. It's weak points, though few, are unfortunate -- making it a really good movie instead of a classic for the ages. Edward Norton as the Derek the skinhead who goes all the way and then sees the light was a bit too intelligent and sensitive to be fully believable. (Perhaps it was because I just saw him recently in Fight Club, and kept seeing a yuppy under the muscles and Nazi tatooos.) Avery Brooks as the black mentor I didn't like much -- he seemed to be a bit too smirky, as though he had all the answers. Also the ending was predictable and a bit overblown. In general toward the end the movie begins to lose its grip, shifting safely into the politically correct. The effect is a sense of betrayal of the gritty reality portrayed earlier. It didn't have to spell out a message -- we already got it.The really standout performances are all by secondary characters: Stacy Keach as the manipulative organizer, Fairuza Balk as Derek's neo-nazi's girlfriend, Guy Torry as the fellow prisoner who helps Derek come around.",American History X
483,DanielStephens1988,Beautiful film about how hatred will never resolve the problem,9,22 October 2019,"The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil.",American History X
484,Benzzo,Gripping and thought-provoking,8,17 June 2000,"I've been wanting to see this film since it first came out.  What took me so long to get around to that, I don't know, but I'm glad I gathered myself to experience the occasion.  First and foremost, Ed Norton has reassured me that he is probably the best male actor of his generation.  It's a stunning performance, it's almost like a floating camera followed a real skinhead through life and in prison and we get to see how he acts.I was glad to find out that this wasn't a movie like Higher Learning where the students had all sorts of racial tendencies for no apparent reason at all, and were so extreme about it.  I mean, come on, have you EVER seen a college campus like that?  But not American History X, the story is always intriguing.  What's best about it is how it shows how there is a false sense of security in numbers.   Many of the blacks and whites think they'll be all right hanging together as long as they don't get killed, but little do they know that their lifestyle is progressively leading them to destruction every day they band together in hate.But what kept this movie from being the greatest of its genre are some of its forced moments.  A few come to mind right away.  One is when the skinheads plan a party for him the day he gets out of prison.  He tells a select few that he has changed and he wants out.  This leads to a scuffle with one of the members and results in Seth (the fat guy) to pull a gun on Ed Norton.  Ed's girlfriend, who was elated to see him and was in love with him before he was locked up just yells ""Do it!  Shoot him, Seth!"" without really knowing what was going on.  The other is the whole idea of how Derek (Ed Norton) got to be a skinhead in the first place.  He is very happy to be under the teaching of a black principal at his high school, but when his dad puts doubt in his mind by siting affirmative-action at his job we don't really get to see how it festers into full-blown racism.  Somehow I don't believe that most white kids whose father was killed by blacks in a non-racially motivated way would tattoo a swastika on their chest and start a white revolt.Still, I am recommending the film for its captivating qualities and the acting performances of not only Norton, but everyone else in the film.  The style is great, color to show the present and black and white (which is probably symbolic in some sort of way) to show the past.  This film is definitely one of the better race relations movies I've seen.*** (out of 4)",American History X

486,PolSci80,More than you know,9,23 May 1999,"American History X wasn't as great as it could've been, but it was still amazing on another level.  You see the transformation of Derek (as played by Edward Norton) from a good kid, to a racist, back to a decent guy, then you're left hanging.....wondering if he's going to go back to being a racist because of what happens to his brother.  The fact that this movie makes you think and doesn't just let you off the hook by explaining everything is admirable.Personally, I think Edward Norton is the best actor in Hollywood today. Deniro, Pacino, Nicholson, Hoffman.....they're basically starting to turn in the same performances while Norton is constantly  treading new ground.  In real life he may have attended Yale, and then there's his boyish roles in Primal Fear and Everyone Says I love You....But as the movie progressed I forgot about all that
Speaking of good performances, I have to recognize Beverly D'Angelo. She's come a long way from the nagging Ellen Griswold of the Vacation movies.  I wonder why she wasn't nominated for an Academy award for her turn as the tortured mother of derek and danny (edward norton), because she deserved it.",American History X
487,1981,"A good film, but limited in scope.",8,11 June 2001,"I would imagine that this could make a very fine book because the issues that the script attempts to address are fascinating and infinitely complicated. However, in a two hour time frame it is very difficult to attempt to understand how the human mind and psyche operates as well as how family dynamics are constructed and/or break down.This movie is primarily concened with the effect racism, loss and hatred have had on Daniel and Derek Vinyard. They lost their father in a racially motivated killing and the stress and tragic results this event had on their family led both of them to turn toward hate, particularly the older Derek who, under duress, vainly attempts to fill his father's shoes after his death. Derek's decision to turn toward a local skinhead organization has a significant impact upon his younger brother who is in need of a father figure.While Derek is in prison he begins to try and reform his ways and through the help of a former teacher, begins to see past the intellectual and logical confines of the racial-hatred he had adopted. His experiences with skinheads in jail only further solidifies his feelings that something is very wrong with racial hatred. Without a doubt we could devote a lengthy picture to studying Derek's character development, his motivations and how his decision making leads him to the different stages in his development. This movie mistakenly attempts to both briefly accomplish this and examine the development of the younger Daniel. The two hour format does not allow more than a cursory attempt at character examination and furthermore, we find that the social tensions and racially motivated hatreds that are so prominent in these two main characters, are not evenly remotely addressed from the point of view of persons on the other side, notably minorities or other poor or lower-middle class whites struggling with similar economic difficulties. The movie leaves us with another equivocal point, what about the racially motivated killing of Derek's brother Daniel. What is the purpose of this action in the story? While on the one hand racial killings occur on a regular basis and for apparently simple reasons, how does this relate to the trajectory of the story? To me it seems like a very simple and Hollywood way of ending a story that is too complicated to resolve in so short a time frame. Is this God paying Derek back? That too seems extremely sophomoric an ending, a very biblical explanation to a question that, by its very nature, is challenging conventions and demanding that those who are willing to entertain its implications, rise above simple answers and their own assumptions and prejudices. The ending is a disappointment because it does not acknowledge the very difficult and complicated causes which led to its very occurence. I have to admit, I walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied. While this was a good film with excellent acting, I must add that the script seems as though it either falls short, or loses its resolve.",American History X

I got this movie out from the library, and was watching it and feel asleep just after the black guys got killed and the film changed to color. It just looked like another one of those crazy American youth type films. I saw the comments on this site, however, and thought I'd better have another look as I still had it out.On watching it a second (first?) time, I overlooked the lecturing (American style) and bad language, and got through to the end. I also found out why the color was being switched on and off. The here and now was in color and the past events in black and white. The film actually got better as it went on. It has an important message of forgiving your enemies and that race hatred doesn't pay. It is also best to get along with everyone if possible, and not try to annoy others.The film also acts as a sort of documentary of American city life, and the problems that young people have. I guess that racism is alive and well in most places.Unfortunately things don't turn out as expected, but they never do in real life anyway. I think it is a good film for people to watch, but it may have limited appeal for women due to the extreme violence, continual shouting, and bad language.

If you aren't moved after watching this movie then you just aren't human.Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton) is one of the most dynamic characters I have ever seen in a movie. I mean he is so impressionable but yet so charismatic at the same time. Very rarely do get that kind of dangerous combination together. He was so gullible and would believe what any strong willed person forced upon him, but the dangerous part is that he take what he learned and influence so many people with it. He had that special something that people were just drawn to. He could make people do whatever he wanted them to do, but in the same turn would do whatever someone else wanted him to do. His transformation by the end of this movie was just so inspiring.

494,Timeee,Watch it and think about it,9,28 November 2007,"I think racism of any type is simply crazy and stupid, however it just doesn't have the same meaning in different situations. It is not the same whether you have racial views in Africa or in America, whether you belong to the major ethnic group or you are part of the minority. The manifestation of racism might be the same but the substance and the motives are different. In American history x I felt these motives were pretty much unconvincing.To begin with Derek is not a cattle-like asshole, like many of his skinhead friends, who only embrace racism because they are too limited to think any further; neither he becomes a racist solely for the benefits of being part of the gang (like the majority, I suppose). Derek actually does think, he is a leader- at least that's the idea. As a result when he does become a racist he does it because of an internal belief that this is the correct, sane thing to do. He arguments, he has an opinion based on facts, he is becoming convinced because of these facts- the point is not that he misinterprets things, the point is that he is not a racist because of the emotional trauma, not because his father died, but because he thinks things that way. In addition his prison rebirth is very unlikely to me. So what was that about after all? He saw one of his gang's members buying pot from a black guy, or a Mexican, i don't remember- so what, is this thing capable to destroy his whole world-view? What did he think, that all white guys have the same ideas as he has? He met a funny, sympathetic black guy- OK , now don't tell me that Derek, intelligent as he was, thought that all black people were jerks. He was not a racist before his father's death, he actually liked Sweeney!-that part was very artificial, I mean, what is this supposed to mean, that Derek forgot just like that everything he had known about people, just because his father died? It was a trauma, his television interview-outburst might be explained with that, sort of a ""homage"" to the racist dad, but why did he start to hate EVERY black person all of a sudden from then on? Like I said before it wasn't just an emotional thing-it couldn't have been. Derek had his theory of black people being more likely to commit crimes, of taking the jobs of decent white people and so on-there was nothing in the movie that made a counter-argument to these, accepted by Derek; he simply forgot these at the end.All in all, my observation is that the movie is very well acted, well structured, but not very realistic. Derek's-and for that matter Danny's- sudden changes of their view are totally unconvincing, because they do not come from the right place- Derek is a nazi because he believes in the theory, and there's nothing that should change him so radically, because every experience he has is mainly emotional. Danny probably never was very convinced of anything, so he is actually much more credible than his brother.",American History X
495,tomiron77,Awesome,9,28 December 2005,"This was an awesome, almost mind-blowing movie. Until I saw this movie on a late night re-run recently on cable, I was always thinking that Edward Norton was overrated and he irritated me in some movies like The Italian Caper. This should have gotten him an Oscar nomination at least (for what it's worth). Maybe it did. Edward Furlong was also superb in a supporting role. I don't see him in movies recently, and I wondered what happened to him? I have a tough time enjoying child actors with big parts in the movies generally, but Furlong in Terminator 2 was one of the very few that seemed really natural and didn't grate. That guy has talent, not just another pretty face.Back to the movie itself, this was a powerful depiction of the scary force and pull of the hatred between races movement. By following the evolution of Edward Norton's character and the resulting circumstances, people around him, the movie was not sermonial, but extremely persuasive and compelling in showing us the consequences of this never ending cycle of rage.

Not only is the story great, the performances in the movie are phenomenal, especially Edward Norton. The guy should've won the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor back then. The dark and haunting score helps lift the atmosphere of the movie to new heights. And the way it is directed (cinematography and such) just adds to everything. The way they use grey scale for Flashbacks is something I just simply adore.This movie is fantastic in every way possible. It is definitely one of my favorite movies and I highly recommend it. DISCLAIMER: This movie isn't always easy to watch.",American History X
497,curiousbush,"Good story and concept, but some glaring flaws",8,25 November 2019,"I thought the movie was good and memorable, but I can't really get over two major plot holes, namely the second.1) Derek initially becomes pissed off at the white prison gang for doing business with Hispanics. This tells us that at that time, he was more ideologically stringent than they were. However, he immediately starts talking with the black laundry guy afterwards, even before being raped. So his initial grievance that led to the rape doesn't make sense.2) When Derek comes back from prison, Danny is fully immersed in white nationalism, hook, line, and sinker. He's enraged when Derek rejects everyone at the party, but suddenly changes his entire worldview from one conversation afterwards? He just says he's sorry that the rape happened to Derek, and that's that? Now he knows that what he's believed for his entire adolescent life is hateful/wrong? Within an hour, he can completely re-examine his ideology and write a regretful paper about it? Huh? He completely skips the stage of questioning. Just goes from one extreme to moderation by hearing that Derek got raped by pseudo-white nationalists and protected by one black guy from other black guys.Essentially, I think the character development was just a little rushed. Still; good movie.",American History X
498,littlerascal-11989,Decent,7,7 October 2018,Ed Norton did a great job in this film about neo-Nazis. I must say though where I felt the film let me down was in the simplistic dialogue in parts. Overall a great film!,American History X

500,AndyInThePieWithAlmonds,A compelling film which may leave you uneasy...,8,1 February 2000,"American History X is an undeniably breathtaking viewing experience. Nevertheless, it left me with certain reservations regarding the message presented. Each racist argument presented during the movie is delivered with considerable detail, feeling and conviction. The anti-racist argument, on the other hand, relies solely on the presence of a couple of sympathetic black characters, a whole load of despicable white ones, and no real equivalent intellectual basis. Whilst it is hopefully correct to assume that the viewer doesn't take much convincing to be repelled by Nazi ideology, this is surely not enough to justify Danny's inevitable and immediate transition from swastika-worshipper to peace-n-love merchant.This movie is far from racist. Scenes such as the hard-to-watch humiliation of a black supermarket check-out girl or the shock ending ensure this. However, I wish the director had put as much energy and vitality into his portrayal of Derek the changed man as he does Derek the charismatic, MTV-style neo-Nazi. A flawed masterpiece, perhaps...",American History X
501,Reel07,Overdone realism,6,5 July 1999,"American History X is a good movie, not a great one. Neither does it make this year's best films, in my opinion. The story is about a former skinhead (played superbly by Edward Norton, who is going to hit it big) who is sent to jail for an intolerable crime. He then ""changes"" (I don't know how, but I can tell you that the film didn't show that, and if it did, then not enough) and comes out of jail, only to come home to his younger brother who seems to have been influenced by him and the story moves on about how the character tries to change his brother's views. As realistic and frightening as the film is, it goes overboard with torture and suffering. There are many scenes which could have been trimmed, including the brutal food market invasion of the skinheads, and an unwatchable prison rape scene. The camera angles are poor, with too many closeups at times. It is a beginning achievment, but I felt discouraged because the topic and story should have been given to a masterful director, like Scorsese, and all the brutality would have been shown in a more absorbing and watchable way. Nevertheless, there are great moments, and great performances. Edward Norton deserved a nomination, but not the oscar.",American History X
502,film-29,This movie is blatantly racist.,1,11 April 2004,"It can be compared with a pick-pocket who after stealing a wallet starts yelling: Catch that thief, catch that thief!If I were a member of Arian Nation I'd screen this movie as a powerful recruiting tool. All the Nazis wannabes would join with tears in their eyes.A few examples: 1)ALL the fights and trouble are started by African-Americans. 2) Koreans play dirty and get stores from real Americans (please tell me what on earth is a real American) just to fire white employees and hire only illegal immigrants. 3) Hispanics are depicted as bunch of wet-backs who enter the US illegally just to be exploited by greedy Koreans.I have only read twenty comments about this still-born and nobody seems to realize that Nazis are equaled to African-Americans. That is, there are two matching sides, two gangs: on the one hand a bunch of obnoxious nazi skinheads, on the other African-Americans. Not to mention that every relevant African-American character on this movie (by relevant I mean a character who can be seen during ten seconds or more) is a punk, an out-law or a member of gang, -or like Dr. Sweeney, a former member of a gang. Also it should be noted that the director of this thing, underhandedly but also coarsely, drops the idea that the nazi violence is some sort of a reaction against a preceding insult: Nazis are bad, but nazi violence is what you get when African-Americans, Koreans and Mexicans move to your neighborhood, get the all the jobs, win the basket-ball plays and date attractive white women.Intentions behind this libel remind me of the Nazis from the movie Bullet Proof Monk who set a Human Right organization in order to hide their actual intentions.And last but not least, have you counted all those shower slow motion takes.

Ignore the hype though: this is a stand-out film. Beautifully lit and shot in black and white it is a tale of hatred and redemption, exploring far-right racist hatred and the violence that underscores many male relationships. The cinematography and lighting are astounding: this is Kaye's debut film (preceded by an illustrious career as a commercials director) and he triumphs. The performances he draws from his lead actors (Edwards Norton and Furlong)are remarkable, career bests from both and it is depressing, though perhaps not surprising, that neither were recognised with either BAFTA or Oscar wins.

508,aaditya-swaroop,Edward Norton Classic,9,18 November 2012,"Powerful, hard hitting, provoking, touching. AMX is truly a classic on a controversial social theme. It is one of those movies where the viewer is left stunned when the end credits start rolling and it takes a moment for him to realize that he just viewed a good work of cinema. Though many movies try, but very few leave such an impact on its audience. AMX has this quality.For me, three things stood out in this movie - Direction by Tony Kaye, dialogues (written by David McKenna) and above all, Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard. Tony Kaye has been known to come out with work on social themes, his other known work being a documentary on abortion debate, Lake of fire (2006). Through AMX, Tony has depicted the impact of the black-white divide in a very impactful manner. His depiction of the struggle that the youth go through and the impact on their impressionable minds is spot on. But more importantly, he was able to convey the message by building up a story which conveys the impact of this racial hatred on the vineyard family - father's killing, Derek's violence, Danny's death. The sequence of events could have been done sequentially without any voice-over. But having this told by Danny's voice with flashbacks made the story more honest and real. Derek's character transformation inside prison made sense and was not random. Tony was himself the director of photography for AMX. He made sure that the shots which needed impact were done differently - slow motion, face shots. The story/screenplay is by David McKenna. Since there was no credits given separately for dialogues, am assuming David wrote the dialogues as well. Unlike other movies handling the same theme, I found the dialogues of AMX were much more though provoking & amazingly articulate. The dialogues weren't just swearing and shouting obscenities - they had meaning and made the viewer understand how clear the character's thought process was. This was amply displayed multiple times - Derek's speech to his gang before they busted the departmental store or the lunch table conversation. The same clarity wasn't showed for Danny's character and rightly so - he was simply confused whether to follow his brother's footsteps or be the good family kid.Tony's and Danny's work would have been unreal had Edward Norton not brought Derek's character to life. I would rate this as one of Edward Norton's classic (along with Fight Club). He powerfully portrayed Derek's pre-prison character as an intellectual youth misguided by neo- nazi propaganda. The extremities of his youthful obsession came out beautifully when the cops arrest Derek for the killing of two black youths, but all he does is smile. There is a look of triumph on his face, a sense of pride. Pure hatred, no regret. Overall, AMX is a thought provoking work of cinema which is well written, nicely directed and brought to life by one of the best actors of our generation, Norton. I rate this movie 8.5 out of 10.",American History X
509,dae5,Norton carries an otherwise unremarkable film.,7,24 November 2003,"I don't purport to have the greatest taste in movies, but I can't help but feel that this movie does not belong in the top 250, especially not the top 100.  If ranking great performances, then yes, Edward Norton certainly qualifies: his turn as a neo-Nazi skinhead is stunning, possibly one of the most powerful portrayals of pure hatred.  Covering the gamut from heartbreaking to frightening, he never lets the character degenerate into a cliche.If only the same could be said for the rest of the movie.  American History X is unquestionably preachy, and even if it's a good kind of preachy (I like the ending, although to many it will be predictable), it's too by-the-numbers approach hinders the filmmakers' ambition to make a profound message movie.  Save Norton, the rest of the players could be cardboard cutouts from any after-school special about bigotry and diversity.But, of course, an after-school special wouldn't include homosexual rape.And despite its shortcomings, watch this movie.  Norton is incredible.",American History X
510,r-downey1,One of the most powerful movies ever made!,10,19 August 2005,"American History X is one of the most important films of are generation which tells us about the true horrors of racial prejudice(from both white and black citizens) that still goes on in our world today. In the state of California a young Neo-Nazi skinhead called Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is arrested and jailed for the violent killings of two coloured men who were trying to steal his van. Then while serving his sentence Vinyard slowly begins to realise just how wrong he was to do all the savage things he did. Derek vows that on the day of his realise he shall be a reformed man and is determined to save his younger brother Danny(Edward Furlong) from adopting to the same life style he had once lead due to the fact that he has already fallen under the influence of Cameron Alexander the older man who had convinced Derek to set up the white power movement that he use to lead, while destroying shops in their area which were owned by foreign businessmen. The story is very well written and makes it easy to understand all the characters. The ending is a bit of a shocker but still powerful as it remains us that every racial group on this earth can be racist not just the while people. Edward Norton's acting as Derek Vinyard in this movie was legendary and easily his best performance so far, passing Fight Club by miles in my opinion. I here he was up for an occur back in 1998 for his role in American History X and was only denied it due to all the controversial scenes in the movie, which I fell was a real shame as he really deserved it much more that anyone else that year. Edward Furlong is also excellent in his role as Danny Vinyard and was a really good narrator throughout the film. The rest of the cast which included Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Fairuza Balk and Stacy Keach are also terrific.This movie is one of the best and most powerful pieces of acting I've ever seen in my life and I'm actually quite surprised its only ranked at number 60 instead of in the IMDb top 20, but oh well I guess popularity polls can never be the exact why you would wish them to be. Anyway this movie has lots of important lessons to teach its viewer and I would suggest everyone to watch it. I overall give American History X a definite 10/10 stars.",American History X
511,oakcourt,American History X,8,22 April 2006,"I've seen a lot of Ed Norton's films and he's one of my list of actors whose films I'd watch initially without bothering to read who thought what of it etc. He was completely scary in this film great acting but scary! I do wonder why he didn't get an Oscar or nomination for this rather than Primal Fear. He was good in Primal Fear but much better in X. It was a little like seeing Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, totally convincing performance. Also made me think how frightening it is when you are faced with those who are so narrow minded as were a lot his friends in the film, and proof of how much peer pressure is a strong influence on not just the young but on us all.",American History X
512,goddangwatir,A heavy film,8,14 March 2020,"American History X, directed by Tony Kaye, is the story of an American Neo-Nazi (Edward Norton) who decides to abandon his cause, and now has to stop his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from going down the same path as he did.As one might have guessed, it is quite a heavy film, and light-hearted movie goers may want to take caution. It is however a movie that everyone should see at least some time in their life, as it teaches a very important message; violence is not the way.The main highlight of the film is Norton's performance. He is simply excellent as Derek Vinyard, and after seeing him as the compassionate big brother in one scene, and as a totally unhinged and chilling psycho in the next (flashbacks), you really understand what range he has got. His Academy Award nomination was well deserved. Edward Furlong plays Danny Vinyard, the younger brother. Although I have never been quite a fan of his voice, I suppose that is just a nit-pick, and he still delivers a fine performance. I also enjoyed Fairuza Balk as Derek's downright creepy girlfriend Stacey.I must also praise the cinematography, especially for the flash-back scenes with the use of black and white. It adds a certain atmosphere to them, which intensify the emotional weight of the entire movie. The editing could be criticized, since the slow motion sequences are perhaps a bit too common, but all in all, it is only a minor flaw. The score, composed by Anne Dudley, is excellent and some moments are simply breathtaking (such as the choir parts from the piece 'American History X'). It too plays a great part in delivering the great emotion the film has.To summarize; American History X is a very powerful film, which definitely left me quite shocked. It features spiffing acting, great visuals and a good soundtrack, but it unfortunately suffers from minor flaws. In my opinion, these flaws can be quite easily glossed over however.80/100",American History X

Edward Norton is astounding, and just when you thought Edward Furlong had disappeared into obscurity, here he is, a fine young actor. The film is flawed, however.  I find some parts a little hard to swallow, but these are minor gripes when there is so much here which is amazing.  I think the black and white/colour thing is a little obvious, cliched and even a little pretensious, but when the film is over, the impact is such that you just don't care, and the overall result is a staggering film.",American History X
514,Dark Scribe,"Shocking, moving, brilliant",9,27 March 2000,"American History X will go down in my memory as one of the best dramatic films ever. It pulled no punches, dealing with racism in its most extreme, violent form, illustrating well how destructive bigotry can be to those unwillingly exposed to its venom and hatred. Undoubtedly the star and shining light of this film was Edward Norton, who finally broke through into the elite of Hollywood, where he fully deserves to be. His portrayal of Derek Vineyard was flawless, hardened bigot one moment, reformed and remorseful killer the next. No doubt that in any other year he would have walked off with Best Actor, his performance was breathtaking. Ed Furlong also delivered a really top performance, as the younger impressionable Danny, delivering his best performance since Terminator 2. Gritty and harsh, this film will live in my memory for a long time to come, not only for the shocking nature of it, but for the best dramatic performance by an actor in a long time. 9 out of 10.",American History X
515,RLove,Racism hitting you in the gut,9,12 August 2002,"I love this movie.  I'm not going to declare it ""perfect"" or one of the best films of all time, but it's nevertheless truly great.  About the first 20 minutes are pretty bad...the story is set up in a clunky manner reminiscent of after-school specials.  The all-wise principal is also artificial, but he is a minor enough character that he doesn't detract too much from the film. I also had a problem with the music in a couple of places, particularly on the basketball court.  I recognize that the usual term is ""dramatic score,"" but this score heaped the drama on way too early in some places.  Like the movie itself, however, the music recovers and begins to simply fit.Ed Norton is the one who made this movie brilliant.  Sometimes when one actor dominates the screen so much the other portions of the movie suffer (personally, I'm thinking of Washington vs. the Canadians in ""Hurricane""), but in this case Furlong was compelling enough to avoid this problem, as one of the two was almost always on the screen.  The Eds are great, and Norton's nomination was well deserved.****SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS****The most common complaint about this film seems to be that the character's turnaround was not believable, that it was ""overnight.""  I couldn't disagree more.  It was not overnight, but over the 1095 nights of his sentence. Derek had a lot of time to think, and that's what undercut his ideology. His Nazi brethren were ignoring the tenets of his belief system, exposing them for what they were--people latching on to an idea for identity, not for the merits of the idea.  As a thinking individual and former honors student, Derek needed to justify his feelings of hatred with logic.  Cameron's teachings fit the bill nicely.  Then he realized that people didn't care about the ideology so much as the image.  Shortly after that his Nazi friends rape him.  As he lays unconcious on the shower room floor, the word that came to my mind was ""wreck.""  Derek was completely wrecked and destroyed.  In his fragile state, who comes to visit him?  A black man.  He initially questions why his former teacher bothered to come, but as the shivering and tearful mass that he is at that point, the friend is sorely needed.  Does it all feel slightly contrived?  The emotional content of the sequence prevents the viewer from feeling the artificiality, but a cerebral examination of the events ends with an answer of ""yes.""  The teacher is too wise and saintly not to be questioned. Disbelief of the teacher's character suspended, is the transformation believable?  Yes.American History X doesn't just tell you that hate is bad.  It may overtly state that ""hate is baggage,"" but it's a message of summary, not instruction.  The movie lets those who watch it truly FEEL that hatred causes pain, and does it as well as I have ever seen it done.  Ordinarily a beginning as poor as this movie's first 20 minutes would greatly lower my opinion of the remainder, but not here.  The rest of the movie is just that good.  9/10",American History X
516,mgr81760,Really Very Well Done,9,28 July 2010,"I just saw this film on DVD. I thought it was very well done.I thought Ed Norton was very well cast in this role, and delivered superbly. In fact, he was a lot more convincing as a white racist then he was the reformed and much milder man who came out of prison. Overall, I thought the acting was very well done with an emphasis on his performance.I liked very much that the script confronted some realities. The speech he gives outside the grocery was correct when seen from that perspective, i.e., he didn't have to make things up to rile up his cohorts, he just had to speak the truth as it presents itself to that demographic: lower white middle class. Mouthing platitudes about how bad racism is a useless endeavor, if we ignore the factors that have so many whites scared and responding in racist fashion in lieu of any other way to express what they see as their grievances. The script forces us to confront the reality that it's not just bigotry that is the problem, but the underlying forces.And I think this is why Danny dies in end. There is no happy ending to this story, because even if Derek is reformed, there's another racist a- borning, either black or white, and willing to use violence to address his problems. This isn't really a happy film, and I don't think anyone can walk away from it feeling the better for it. But I do think we walk away having learned from it, and that, indeed, is what art is about.",American History X

Seriously, did we go to the fridge for refreshments during all the parts containing the black guy Norton does laundry with in prison? Or how about all the parts containing the ""Doctor"" (the principal of the high school)? Did we ignore those parts? Maybe i'm mistaken, but they seemed like pretty likable characters to me. The rest of the black characters SERVE THEIR PURPOSE. Most of them are gang-members, you're not SUPPOSED to like them. And how about half of the ""skinheads""?

Very powerful and moving performances and a helluva strong storyline make this movie a hell of a ride. Norton and Furlong and DAngelo work together well as a family hurt from hatred.

Rightists are violent, crazy racists! Oops--a few problems. ""Nazi"" means ""National Socialist."" They were leftists, not rightists. If the film had been honest it would have blamed the neo-Nazi movement as a response to the liberal/socialist programs in this country that fragment people into primitive, racial, ethnic tribes.

This movie suffers from organizational problems i.e. jumping from year to year like hopscotch, spending an extremely short amount of time on important scenes and vice versa, etc. Aside from the fact that it was interesting, the film was overdone and sophomoric.

This movie totally disillusioned me and showed just how incomprehensible a true racist's mind is. I still can't shake the last, dramatic and shocking scene from my mind. It was one of the few times I've wept openly during a movie, and it shows the absolute futility of unconditional hate. This movie isn't for the emotionally immature.

Edward Norton is a powerhouse in this movie, nobody could have close to pulling this off as well as he did.  Un forunately, he was up against Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful, for the best actor award at the Oscars.  Edward Furlong comes out of nowhere and gives a brilliant performance playing his Norton's confused brother who is caught up in the whole Nazi mess that his brother used to be part of.

What's insidious is that hatred often begins with some rational arguments, which are masterfully presented in the movie. But those arguments are not so much intended to persuade, as to tap into deep human instincts of self preservation. Those fears trigger anger, and rational thought becomes distorted.A powerful metaphor for the entire film occurs in the brief scene where Daniel begins his ""American History X"" essay. He types in the line ""Analyze and interpret"". As the line repeats down the page it mutates and becomes increasingly incoherent, then abruptly rematerializes in a reconstituted form that looks similar to the starting point, but is in fact vulgar. This progression foreshadows the rest of the movie, on several levels.The movie demonstrates that any group based on hatred, whether neo-Nazis, gangs or terrorists, leads only to the ultimate ruin of its' members.",American History X
528,hyperexcel,"Brilliant, passionate, gut-wrenching",9,16 July 2003,"American History X tore out of me any innocence that might have been left concerning race relations today.  There is no doubt that this movie is passionate about the pockets of American people who are so embittered over each other's race.  The journey of a Neo-Nazi (Norton) from his first encounter with racism to the spiralling descent into hellish prison ends with an indescribable finale that left me paralyzed in my seat.  Edward Norton is quite possibly the finest actor of his generation, proving yet again that his ability to seep into a dark, uninhibited soul is paramount among his peers.  Edward Furlong has come a little ways since the tough kid John Conner of Terminator 2 fame; he has the same attitude, but the context of the movie certainly adds clout to his performance.  The surrounding cast is amazing.  Beverly D'Angelo is truly amazing as the desperate mother of two lost boys, and Avery Brooks as the determined Principal attempting to free the would-be Neo Nazis scores big.  The cinematography, o the cinematography!!!  The non-linear story ties in to Danny's class assignment on his brother wonderfully; the change from color to b&w works very well; all the past events seem even more brutal and honest than the scenes in color do.  The one piece I would have to pick on American History X for is a few loose ends that seemed to be asking to be resolved at the end.  The angry Neo-Nazi gang, the basketballers from the past, and the high school thugs all had a very equal and probable chance of reentering the plot at the crucial point, but the two left out of the picture were a small distraction when the main focus was staring me in the face.  Overall, this intense and violent portrait of hate in America left me emotionally paralyzed for several minutes.  I can't even describe the roller coaster of nihlist-to-optimist-to-confused emotions the movie left in my lap after the climax.  The entire movie was a kick in the face and I recommend it be seen by anyone in America doubting or even championing race relations in America today.9/10",American History X

There is so much cr*p out there that people want to talk about as if it were important, but this film is so much more interesting and edifying. It seemed so real that it almost felt like a documentary. Afterwards, you just want to discuss all the issues raised in it, from neo-Nazis to racism to the American school system to anti-Semitism to the prison system. Be sure to watch with intellectually awake friends to discuss those issues and your new insights with them. But be ready for violence and cussing. Seeing that makes you wonder how anyone from such a home could possibly leave his or her family as a psychologically and emotionally intact human being. The fact that such excellent actors as Edward Norton, Stacey Keach, and Beverly d'Angelo played in this movie shows you how important it was to them to make a stand.",American History X

The party was really disgusting. It had a good, well written story. Great screenplay and cinematography with useful use of color for the flashbacks. The score was beautiful. Brilliant acting by Edward Norton. His Oscar nomination was very well deserved. The development of the character he played is one of the best I've ever seen. There were some very disturbing scenes like the pavement side scene. Which became especially gross when Danny told about the sound that action made. I'm still shivering thinking of it. The scene of Derek running to the school was moving and one of the best scenes in the movie. The scenes in the prison were also very powerful.

Even though it came out in USA last year its only just been released where i live. This was an excellent drama, some very brutal scenes in the movie. It was also very scary because Edward Nortons performance as a skinhead, was so utterly convincing. He's definately one of the best actors around.      A few negative things stuck out in the movie though. For example when Derek is telling Danny about his turnaround in prison, Danny accepts he's right straight away, and if Derek was so intelligent and smart, how come he was so easily turned towards hating blacks? I know his father put a few thoughts in his head, and he was killed by a black gang, but please!! I also thought the slow motion scenes were a bit too ""Hollywood"". I shouldn't be too picky though, because although the movie has a few flaws, American History X is still a stunner.",American History X

Tony Kaye's direction leaves much to be desired, and the musical decisions within the film make you feel like you're watching The Last of the Mohicans, and not a contemporary film about race.  Derek Vinyard's transformation from skinhead to savior is admirable, but even this main character's development is done poorly, as are the other roles.  The plot (though somewhat lacking in sophistication) is engaging enough, yet Edward Norton's superb acting alone saves this piece from being completely unwatchable -- further convincing this viewer how much better this movie would have been under different direction.

It's like if the movie spins a web that brutally absorbs you. Honestly.I first watched this film projection on a festival that was doing a school. The room was filled over to the top. But, actually at the middle of the movie some people really went out. Specially, two girls. They went out crying as hell. But, anyway, that's another story.American History X is directed by British director Tony Kaye and written by David McKenna. Is about a racist, Derek, (wonderfully played by an impeccable Edward Norton) that wants to 'clean' (let's put it that way) its neighbourhood of colour people (I am not a racist) and Mexicans and all. But after he is arrested for killing two colour people (and crushed it's head to one of them) he reforms of what he has do. But, his little brother, Danny, (played by an excellent Edward Furlong) is following Derek's steps. But Derek will do anything (even go back and look, in a metaphorical way, to his disturbing and terrifying past).Verdict: An stunning and truly terrifying movie, with magnificent performances, excellent music and beautiful photography, that you won't soon forget. An instant classic. Edward Norton's performance is one of the best of the history of cinema. An extreme odyssey. Definitely, one of the most daring movies of the last 100 years. It's a shame that I can only give 10 stars to this movie. I would give it 1 000 or a million or all the stars in the world. A masterpiece. One of the best pictures ever made.

540,gnc3736,Where no man has gone before.,8,21 July 2003,"American History X is a piece of brilliant satire that director Tony Kaye took to the next level.  No one has ever to my knowledge made a film about Nazism.  It's all ways been considered such a sacred thing that no director, producer, or movie goer would ever want to touch.  The amount of symbolism and irony in this film is unbelievable.   Edward Norton as usual delivers a brilliant preformance as a White supremicist who is jailed for murdering two gang members for attempting to break into his car.  While he is in prison his younger brother (Edward Furlong) begins to show signs that he is following in his brothers foot steps.  While in prison nortons character meets a group of fellow skin heads who end up turning on him.  It is then that he relizes that you can't hold a certain group of people responible for the actions of just a few, and that hate is just a waste of time.  The entire cast delivers an excellent preformance.  I strongly recomend this film to those with a strong stomach and a desire to see a film that wasn't made for profits, but made to teach something.  It's rare these days for a film to really teach something, but at the same time keep you interested and wondering whats gonna happen next.",American History X

The role he plays as Derek Vineyard took me above the water. He played it so well that it was almost like he was playing himself in this film. The movie starts out as black white then goes to color. The movie is filmed in black n white to show the past and the color to show the present. The movie is very well acted and Edward should of won the Oscar for best actor but at least he was nominated so that's just as superior. Avery Brooks whose from Star Trek also does an amazing job. He's like a God given actor like Morgan Freeman is. This movie is a powerful drama so there are some pretty heavy scenes in it and it is also pretty graphic too just to warn people who haven't seen it yet.

This movie carries with it a powerful and gripping performances by Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and all the others in this movie.Basic Movie Guide: Derek Vinyard's (played by Edward Norton) father is killed while fighting a fire by suspected Compton drug dealers. Over the next few years, he transforms from a innocent teenager, to a anger fueled Neo-Nazi, who begins a gang in California called the D.O.C. (Disciples of Christ) and recruits young impressionable teenagers to commit acts of intimidation on immigrants and. One night, he murders two Crips and is sent to prison for three years. While in prison, he must confront a harsh truth: his little brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path that his older went down. Faced with this revelation, Derek must make a choice: continue down his path of destruction, or forsake the lifestyle that he, himself, built.My Notes: Spoiler Alert (may give away certain aspects of the movie but nothing too much I promise, but still if you wish to be surprised avoid reading until you see the section entitled ""Verdict"")The rape in this movie is (while not as graphic as one of my other movie reviews I Spit on Your Grave) is still disturbing. However, it is not completely unwatchable. And while my previous review of I Spit on Your Grave may cast me in a hypocritical light, this rape is not graphic, it is enough to tell you what happened, and then it is over. It doesn't hang on it over ten or twenty minutes and then try to make a movie out of it. It starts, it ends in less than thirty seconds, and the movie continues.The murder of one of the gang members in this movie is also disturbing, and graphic. The way he is killed is brutal, but it's over in less than second, if you blink, you will miss it.And the ending is something that you will never see coming. It will makes some people literally jump in their seats, I promise you of that.Spoiler Ended (Continue Reading)Verdict: Some may view this as a racism melodrama. Some may hate this movie because it may come across as preachy, or may even see it as trying too hard to be something more than just entertainment. But for my part, I enjoy this movie, and highly praise this movie for it's message, its powerful acting and how it depicts racism for what it truly is: a fire that sucks in everything around to feed it and burns everything it touches, and sometimes that flame burns you the most.Rating 10/10",American History X

Edward Norton does an amazing job, playing basically two very different characters throughout the movie. Edward Furlong also does a great job. The story is everything you can hope for. It has deep characters that go through tragedy and failure, with a glimpse of hope at the end, that is even more tragically shattered immediately. The story is about ideology, how ideology works and spreads, hate, the root of hate and change. All of this is brought to the screen in an absolutely stunning way. Not only great black & white footage, but also breathtaking closeups and slow- motion make for a beautiful movie. The music is just beautiful as well. This movie stuck with me for quite a while (maybe it had a little more impact for me than others because I'm German, who knows), and I still think about it a lot. I definitely recommend this movie.

It's amazing to see a single film take a character and develop him in such a way that it seems like two opposite and distinct personalities.  Ed Norton gave the performance of his life in this movie, and it's too bad that the Academy Award for best actor can't go to two people in a single year.  The thing that impresses me the most is the way that they didn't stereotype the characters like they did in ""Higher Learning"" or make them completely wooden like in ""Juice"" or ""Menace.""  Norton's shining and most convincing moment didn't even come with dialogue in this film.

On the plus side:  some really solid acting, including Edward Furlong, Bevery D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Guy Cory, Ethan Suplee, and most striking because it is so understated, Elliot Gould as the mother's Jewish boyfriend.  Other pluses:  a different look at another kind of bigotry; the relationship between the brothers; the interplay between Norton & Cory; the powerful prison scenes.   On the downside: the heavy handed music, the preachiness, Sweeney's cardboard character, the pretentiousness of some of the arty photography, etc.  One does wonder what a better director (Spielberg, Scorcese)  might have done with the film!

I did expect a certain level of didactics, which is very difficult to avoid when dealing with a complex and sensitive issue.The film is not one-sided, but it is unbalanced. We hear some very powerful arguments from the fascists, and get a very strong emotional message from the other side but neither is reciprocated. We do not really see the hatred in the fascists and hear no argument against them from normal' society. What we end up with is a messed up message that says these guys may be right but hate is bad because it does not make us feel good.I am  of course  simplifying, but being a cerebral person, I expect a cerebral argument. There are very good arguments against the white supremacists that can go way beyond the let's love each other because the other options are ugly' argument that was presented here. The grievances' voiced are never challenged. Are we supposed to reject the arguments just because reprehensible people represent them? Do not be too taken by my grumbling here, this is a very good movie, truly a must see for everybody. It just had the potential to be a lot more than what it is.

It almost has a documentary feel to it, the way we observe Derek's development is so well portrayed - it's an odyssey of a journey. It reminds me, in some ways, of Oliver Stone's Talk Radio (another great film). Here is a guy with some real pain inside and is looking for an outlet. Well, he finds it with the help of Stacy Keach's character and it would have been interesting to see their initial encounter. This movie succeeds where lesser attempts (like Higher Learning) fail, probably because the film treats all of its characters, racists and non-racists alike as people (not an easy thing to do) and not just cardboard racial or social stereotypes. The dialogue is tremendous. I don't know why people here seem to have trouble with Derek's laundry co-worker, his dialogue is really so much more than simple jokes. Perhaps there are some flaws in this film, but it doesn't matter. You'd have to be dead inside not to be moved...",American History X
552,kylekool150,"An observant, realized Crime-Drama about hate and change",9,26 October 2007,"American History X is a movie that details a graphic portrayal of a former Neo-Nazi, Derek Vinyard, who is sent to prison for 3 years for 2 murders. After experiencing certain unimaginable horrors of prison, he realizes he has to steer his younger brother, Daniel, from going down the wrong path. The events that follow what I have told you, are shocking, controversial, but not meant to direct any hate the characters express in this film, yet I don't think anybody who sees such shocking scenes as the Supermarket Riot, Prison Rape or even the ending, would want to have any affiliation with the horrible things portrayed in this movie.This film, and it's characters, are very realized. Edward Norton plays a convincing role as Derek, in which he earned an Oscar Nod. The Director, Tony Kaye, makes the film stylized and different by using color as recent events, and B&W as past events. A little touch that art-house film fans will probably enjoy. This film might be pretty compelling to some, but for those who understand the well intended morality of it all, will be thrilled.Films as recommendable as this, don't come along too often, but this film proves that independent films are still around today, and are just as enjoyable as other great dramas such as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"" and more. With that said, this film is definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and without giving away anything too interesting in the film, I will end my review.3/4 Stars",American History X
553,ravenmccoy_ff5,Norton at his finest!,9,25 September 2003,"As a huge fan of Edward Norton, I feel drawn to see any film of his. 'American History X', however was the film that cemented my admiration for such a young and brilliant actor. When I first saw him in 'Primal Fear' I figured that it would be that film that set him apart from the rest, but as soon as I saw 'American History X' it changed.'American History X' is one of the few films that change your life. I don't think anyone could watch it without feeling touched in one way or another. Whether it's because they see themselves in one of the characters or because of the sudden disrespect you feel at being a human, you are touched in some way or another.The story sets to tell the tale of the Derek Vinyard and Danny Vinyard, two brothers once joined by power, destruction and racism but now torn apart by the things that they once held close to their hearts and valued above everything. After a three year sentence in prison, Derek Vinyard has been taught a few lessons and his out look on life has changed. No longer does he hate black people and strive for a day when everything is 'American', he now values family over everything that he had, power, love and the label of the white man.Although some people may find this film hard to watch it should be shown to people as a lesson in what is and isn't important in life. It should be used and a warning to people who no longer hold human beings as equals and are shallow enough to only see the colour of someone's skin, and more importantly see it as a good thing.This film is flawless, from start to finish the editing, lighting, sound, acting, direction and script shine so brightly it's indescribable. Trust me when I say that this film will change your whole out look on life. The fact that this film only received one Oscar nomination to me sum's up the poor state of affairs when such a ground breaking film is not acknowledged.Star rating off the chart and it will probably be the most productive 114 minutes of your year.",American History X

I didn't know much about the film, only that it was related to racism. I found the brainwashing of Derek and Danny completely shocking, and the scene with the pavement chilled me to the bone, especially the look on Derek's face after the deed was done. Something I am not quite sure of is why Danny, having seen something so awful, would decide to go down the same route as his brother. I guess it was the only route he could see, but it just didn't quite stack up.Probably more shocking was Derek's turnaround in prison. I didn't expect that really. The shower scene was just so awful, but I am still surprised that he changed his views after being such a hard line racist previously.

557,navyfrog,The answers are endless,10,7 April 1999,"This is a powerful movie with a harsh reality overshadowing it to great effect.  The hateful rhetoric becomes almost plausible as you listen to Derek's (Edward Norton) views at the dinner table, or his recruitment campaign to the other young neo-Nazis.  The writer/director cohorts do an impressive job of accentuating the vicious circle of racism, and the actor portraying the main character, Edward Norton, carries out a brilliant performance worth remembering.I found the symbolic effects used throughout the movie were very effective, some being more subtle than others.  The most obvious was the use of black and white film for the flashbacks, when Derek (Norton) was a neo-Nazi, and the contradicting use of colour when he was released from prison, reformed. The suggestion that everything was black and white for him when he had his racist, bigot and white-power beliefs; everything was so clear and sensible to him; he was right, they were wrong, was ambitious and significant.  White was good; black, or any other tone for that matter, was bad.  The switch to colour during scenes when he was reformed was a hint at the refreshing nature of what life can be when you look at it from a different angle, when you take down your wall of hatred.Another little symbolic reference was the bowl of jellybeans.  Seth picked out the one black one before chugging down the whole bowl of white ones. Although at first glance it may seem like a joke, as if you think he's picking out one jellybean to eat it, but as a reference to his excessively overweight condition, swallows the majority of the candy, if you think for a second it's fairly easy to spot the white/black ratio, and his reaction to it.One other quick symbolic gesture was Derek's move at the coffee shop near the end of the movie.  He held open a door for a woman who was not white. Quite subtle, but effective.  There were quite a few other events or items with a similar purpose that I noticed at the time I was watching the movie, but which I unfortunately cannot remember at this moment.To end this ferociously long spiel on American History X, I just wanted to respond to a comment that another IMDB member who reviewed this movie said:""So neo-Nazism isn't the answer, but what is?  The movie leaves you dangling on this point, not really resolving anything.""But that's the exact point. Nothing is resolved in this world.  People look for answers in the wrong places, and most of the time never find them. Leaving the movie unresolved, yet establishing a blockade against neo-Nazism is not, in my opinion, unrealistic or unfurnished quality.  Nay, in fact, it's the opposite.  It IS realistic, because whether you search for answers in religion or gangs or hate, etc. etc. etc., you aren't going to find it. The answer to life is within yourself.  And the answers are endless.  I feel that's what this movie was trying to explain.",American History X

Hate IS a burden, as is so well depicted by this film, but what is most impressed upon in this movie is the fact that our ideas have to come from somewhere, and a family member is the most likely source. For anyone who has grown up with elder siblings, you know this to be true. From what I understand, young women grow up trying their hardest, not to be their mothers, and young men grow up trying equally as hard to BE their fathers, or someone their father will respect.  The family unit is a perfect backdrop for this film.  It proves that someone is always watching how we behave, and applying it to themselves.  It also shows that our actions affect everyone around us.  No action is solely self affective, but effects everyone with whom we interact. 
By carrying the burden of hate, it is so easy to be impressionable, and to cling to facts that are not necessarily true, especially if they feed that hatred.  I felt that Edward Norton was untouchable in this role.  He was intense and his portrayal of this character was unmistakably effective. 
Edward Furlong was also a natural casting choice for his character.  Both actors were superlative in this movie.  They play memorable characters and portray the conflict in such a way that you won't soon forget it. 
With no trouble at all, I rate this film a captivating 10/10.",American History X

564,stansellb,Truly a superb film.,10,16 April 2015,"The film is explained in the first five minutes. Sweeney says simply ""This child is confused"" ""He learned it and he can unlearn it"". It's a movie about how hate is taught, almost inherited. 99% of all racial issues in America today are explained in this film. We aren't born evil, we're made that way through years of conditioning. Our fathers are our models for God, if our fathers fail, what does that tell you about God?Many of the images in this movie are hard to watch. Even harder to admit that these things still happen today and the only cure is education and knowledge. Hating someone is easy. Knowing someone takes work. Quite possibly Norton's best movie. And while Avery Brooks is always great, I'd say this is the shining star in his career. And while everyone knows furlong from T2, I think he's awesome in this pic; truly showing that he does have acting ability.If you haven't seen this pic, you should. You won't feel comfortable if only because you can probably know someone like one of the characters in this film. It's a great pic with a great lesson.",American History X
565,led_zeppelin_zoso,"Amazing, Edward Nortons best performance",9,2 March 2005,"In my opinion this movie should have have been nominated for several awards then the Oscar would have gone to this instead of ""Shakespear in love"". Nortons performance makes this movie rise even higher than most movies. Edward Furlong drops his girl voice he used in ""Terminator two"" and gives a believable performance driven by emotion and defeat.The way this movie deals with revenge and revolt of the other race keeps you thinking for the whole movie. I liked how the should the conflicts of the two races during a basketball game and the outcome for the loser. Tony Kaye captures the emotion so well in this movie it makes you feel sad at some points, happy at others even mad and excited. This may have been a very controversial movie and i can understand that but I think the people who did not see this movie because of the high rate of racism should see it for what it shows about the society many people are in and how it can ruin your life along with the ones you love. This movie i recommend to everyone because it is simply one of the most structured films ever made, be prepared to be moved and shaken.",American History X
566,adithyasivas-234-471768,Edward Norton Steals The Show,8,3 September 2015,"This is by far, one of the greatest films I've ever seen which tackles the issues on racism, social inequalities and stereotypes. The movie is basically about a neo-Nazi skinhead who is an extreme racist, and part of a supremacist group mainly because of influences from his father, and Cameron Alexander, who is a hate-writer and a racist on the same grounds as his father. We don't get to see it much, but Cameron mainly serves as a father figure for Derek, which is why he does half the things he does throughout the course of the plot. How Derek finally realizes his mistakes, and reforms as a good and normal human being forms the crux of the plot. The movie swings between black and white visuals, and color, the former which signifies the skinhead days and flashback of the Vinyard family which is told in both Derek and his brother's perspective, and the latter being the new and reformed Derek's story. Edward Norton is the main show-stealer in this movie. After Primal Fear, and Fight Club, this is a 30 pound heavier Norton who plays a badass, and a normal human being throughout the course of the film. Tony Kaye's cinematography is brilliant, as is Anne Dudley's superb compositions which reverberate throughout the film's runtime. I was surprised that only Edward got an Oscar nomination, which he did not win (another surprise). I also felt that Tony Kaye, the film and Anne Dudley's score should also have been recognized. Other than a few niggles here and there, such as the actress who plays Norton's girlfriend in the movie's not so great performance, this movie is a treat to watch from the first minute. A must-watch.",American History X

To my surprise, it's a absolutely superb drama about the consequences of urban racism. A movie like I've never seen before.Filled with realistic characters, thought-provoking social commentary with a bite and moments of brief, shocking violence. The acting is superb all around with Edward Norton gives a strong performance to a character that we start off despising but gradually emphatising and liking in the end. Edward Furlong was also superb with his mature performance, although one would wish that his character could be developed more. The supporting cast, which includes Derek's sister, his mother and also his African-American friend in Jail.Directing is tremendous with the usage of unusual camera angle and black and white flashbacks, but doesn't make the story confusing. Some may find the violence are too strong, but it's adequate and realistic.At first I thought it's going to be another boring drama movie but instead ended up with a well made, superbly executed and involving movie that will leave you thinking.

568,Ari-21,This was probably the best movie I've ever seen,10,9 December 1998,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.",American History X

I just have to say that even months after I first saw this movie, it still amazes me. This is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have seen and was completely blown away and mesmerized by the performances given by the entire cast, especially the performance given by Edward Norton. Edward Norton has great talent as an actor and is probably one of the best actors Hollywood has seen of late. I remember watching Primal Fear with him and remember how his performance completely suckered me in his ""I'm-suffering-from-multiple-personalities"" and the first thing I said after viewing the movie was how he rightfully deserved an Oscar nod, even the award itself.The movie itself was great; it does something that Hollywood normally tries to stray away from: depicting aspects of the real world as honest as possible. This film shows the consequences that one must suffer should they decide to hold such a deep hatred for another person just because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. It is also quite graphic, so should someone decide to watch it, I suggest you not eat anything while watching this movie.Overall, this movie, in my opinion, is close to perfection as a film can get and I definitely recommend anyone who believes they are mature enough to view this film as it does deal with very, very, VERY mature subjects.",American History X
570,herb-20,One of the Best Films I've Ever Seen,10,13 April 1999,"When I First saw this film November last year and last week again on video, I thought, this is a good movie.  Soon, it became one of my favorite films, and besides for Saving Pvt. Ryan, I thought it was the best film of the year.  It depicts drama, violence, and other elements so excellently, so brutal, it can get a little scary at times. The film is about a teenager named Derek Vinyard (oscar nom. and shoud've been winner Edward Norton).  Right when he and his family were doing well near Venice Beach.  But, after his father, a fireman, gets murdered by a black man, Derek feels enraged, and with a felo neo-nazi, forms the DOC (I don't know what this means, but the org is only for Venice beach Nazis).  He and his group vandalize stores with Extreme prejudice.  But after he catches 2 black men try to jack his car, he goes to jail for murder.  Jail dissolved his ways of thinking (partly thanks to his teacher played by Avery Brooks). When he returns, he wants out (and also for his follower brother played by Edward Furlong).  The rest you'll have to see for yourself. This film explores many psychological transformations and torment.  And thanks to great performances (by all characters especially Norton) this makes the film great and provocative",American History X

American History X gives an honest portrayal of racism in the world we live in.  You see, people who follow radical actions like the crime of hate usually have something that has lead to their radical behavior.  One thing that really stuck deep within my soul is the realism that the people that are behind all these terrorist acts have in their minds reasons for their behavior.  I felt sorrow for the incredibly true to life racist inequality that is prevalent everywhere.  Edward Norton was absolutely brilliant in this film!  I believe that he will rise to the challenge of any character he portrays.  The truth is that life is not what it seems at times.  This film, done so perfectly, gives us that view.  One can not agree more after seeing American History X.",American History X

576,mssandlin,One of the most powerful films ever made,8,3 October 2002,"""American History X"" is one of the most challenging and thought provoking movies I have ever seen.  I'm not usually big on films and filmmakers that have an ax to grind.  I prefer a good story to a good sermon most of the time, but this film manages to provide both.  The characters are so real, and their feelings are so common to young people today that it's almost scary.  The film's star, Ed Norton,  is, without a doubt, the best actor of his generation.  His performance is flawless, and is a huge part of why this movie is as good as it is.  Despite the incredibly graphic violence, the horrific language, and the nudity, this film is a must see in my book. Even though most white kids in America would deny that they are racists and would completely reject any form of Nazism, they still identify with Danny Vineyard's feelings.  The racist speeches Derrick Vineyard delivers with such passion (the one in front of the grocery store, and the one at the dinner table come to mind) strike chords deep inside of most of us.  We hear him speak, and understand how people could get caught up in these ideologies.  Then, we see the results of his ideas.  Amazingly, we all sympathize with Derrick when he's crying on T.V. about his father's death; we sympathize with him when he says ""It's Americans who are poor and hungry.' and we absolutely love him when he steps in to win the basketball game.  Then we abhor him as he beats the grocery store owner.  We cringe as he smiles after brutally killing a two people.  We rail against the swastika tattooed over his heart.  Derrick Vineyard shows us something about racism that most of us overlook.  He shows us that while racism is a terrible thing, racists aren't necessarily terrible people, and he proves it during the color scenes in the movie.   The knockout punch comes with the final scenes, as the film takes a twist and gives us a piercing picture of reality that makes us reevaluate all the things we have come to feel during the course of the movie.   This film is truly, an unforgettable piece of art.",American History X

Full marks for avoiding the trap of painting evil as repellent and ugly, or furthering the fiction that humanity divides neatly between the perfect ones and the monsters. Hannah Arendt surely had it right when she spoke of the banality of Evil ; she might have added that it usually comes in charismatic disguise, as with the main character in this film. Only when we can deal authentically with the strongest of the enemy's arguments, are we really in a position to overcome him. This movie contributes powerfully to this struggle ; it is a gripping film that speaks both sides of the argument, pulls no punches and leaves us gasping with the pain of sin.",American History X
580,BlueHeMan,A Powerful must see Drama,9,12 December 2002,"Few films have had an effect on viewers (at least for me) like 'American History X.' The movie gives us excellent characters and a meaningful plot and send a timeless message...""hate is baggage."" The story involves Danny (Ed Furlong) and his brother Derek(Ed Norton). Danny is a punk and his teacher makes him write an essay after Danny does a book report on Mein Kampf. Danny eventually decides to just start writing about his older brother and skin-head leader, Derek. He tells about the family's past, how the father was killed by some black men and how Derek began to gain prestige as a Nazi Skinhead gang leader... Then Derek gets out of prison for murdering 2 black men.  Now a changed man, he tries to steer his younger brother away from the Nazi Skinhead movement by giving him his story of being in prison and how horrible it was. This creates conflict in Danny who tried so hard to be like is older brother and is already deep into the local skinhead group. The film does an excellent job of striking emotions in the viewer. As a white man, I cringed when Derek stomps on the black man's head while making him bite the curb, but I could sort of sympathize with Derek as he goes off on a rant at the dinner table about how minorities bring down the system. The film does this constantly to us: IT uses triumphant music, humor, and character strengths to make us believe in Derek. We cheer when the skinheads beat the black guys in basketball for possession of the courts, but then we want to strangle Derek and his buddies when they terrorize the local convenience store which employs minorty workers. This is the other way the film gets us, by making us angry at the skinhead group and ultimately sympathetic again for Derek and his family at the film's end. The acting is incredible throughout the film. Norton was horribly snubbed as best actor in '98 for this movie. The characters are believable and we learn to care about them. Even if you are sensitive to racial issues or squeamish about profanity or nudity, you should not avoid 'American History X'. It is very powerful and may change the way you feel about certain people. You don't want movies to tell you WHAT to do, but this one, like 'Boyz n the hood' gives you an idea of what might happen if you don't have an open mind.

Some of the acting is a bit over the top; however, most of it is very good.The film doesn't leave us with a lot of answers, nor does it bother to sugarcoat the stark realities that still plague our country regarding this racial divide. Would more good have been done if the money and talent put towards this film had been expended towards directly solving the problem? With out art, our society would be even more pathetic then it is.Some of the cinematic devices employed were too obvious; black and white for memory scenes; some aspects of the film were jarring and others were rife with stereotypes.

But the cops would never buy it or throw him in jail...Finally at the end he goes into a church and he decides he's going to change his life. Tomorrow he would make himself presentable and try to get a job and everything...and then the cops come in the church and arrest him for loitering!

Although enhances an excellent story, plus to add to it, a film in which has only very occasionally been done before, director Tony Kaye has created a master piece, which sets an extremely good example of what may happen to racist people. Having said that, the black and white scenes are unnecessary. Spielberg created 'Schindler's list' in black and white in 1993, and this worked beautifully, setting the field of a dark chapter in human history.

This film takes you on one hell of an emotional, and sometimes disturbing ride, as we get to explore the characters in full detail. There is no doubting Edward Norton's flawless performance as the film's lead role, Derek Vineyard. I think he made a big impression on the final outlook that I had myself of the film. Which wasn't a bad one, believe me. I think it would do everyone good to see this film, (even though it isn't easy viewing) because it deals with issues that need to be brought to public attention more often, and shows that violence certainly is NOT the way, to work things out.A truly amazing masterpiece, that in my opinion, deserves every last bit of praise, that it recieves.",American History X

It deals with big problems and it will have thinking about yourself for a long time American History X has to do with change. Edward Norton plays a reformed skin head that tries to change his brother after he gets out of jail and starts to examine both of their lives. He is put into jail because he killed two black people. His hatred for the Afican Americans started when his father was killed by one. He turns into a Neo-Nazi and his brother follows suit. While in jail his perception changes when he becomes friends with and African American and some Nazis in the jail treat him bad(don't want to get in to much detail).The movie jumps from black and white to color flawlessly and Edward Norton gives his best performance ever.

586,ohthatgigi,Its amusing how one-dimensional this film is.,2,1 April 2014,"So Edward Norton is supposed to be a chameleon kind of actor, abode in the upper echelon of thespian professionalism with a distinctive character and absolutely a cut above the rest of the Hollywood illiterates. I've heard of this movie for so long but never intrigued by the signal-blazing poster and preaching-sound plot. But then I watched it by default and become so angry that compelled myself to rant out my rage. Its rub*ish, don't sully your eyes by it.Honestly, every character is black and white. Long overdue prodigal son who used to be a loving a caring straight A student got lectured by his racist old man and SUDDENLY abandon all his DOUBLE PHD black teacher's words and starting to mutter extreme racist remarks on news report when his ""honest hardworking"" firefighter dad got shot and killed. Then unsurprisingly he was claimed to be brainwashed and apparently become the rabbis of his secret guild. And his uncontrollable ANGER(so symbolic and repetitively accentuated in the movie that you started doubting if the director thinks the audience are all eight year old) moved to his family, to defend his belief and stand out for his horrendous looking lady friend. he even stuffed a chunk of beef into his sister's mouth to shut her up. AND he killed the guys who tried to sneaked his car through the most thrilling way(I didn't know if you put mouth on curbs and kick it could kill a man). I'm flabbergasted how the storyline goes exactly as I predicted(I learned in primary school if you want to salute a kind of concept you first suppressed it and then through a heavenly epiphany you realized the folly of you and the mightiness of the concept, say the virtue of be punctual), I thought maybe deviated a little from the standard via but sadly, sadly it doesn't. the linchpin of the movie got his second life and love education behind bars by his fellow linen worker and a f*ck in the a*s.Every character is either purely good or evil, all deprived of sanity and love and proper education. The fat bug killer is a racist for a reason, he simply is insolent and grumpy as hell about his life, he eats jelly beans with a bow; the mason-vision gangster are dramatized and demonized to present the very extremity of racism, which itself desensitize the audience and shift the concept of racism to terrorism. Apparently the director itself is undereducated but ridiculously bold to produce a film regarding racism without do much research about the itself. You'd startled by the level of superficiality and phoniness of the film. They even spent 3 mins on a black versus white basketball game.yeah.",American History X
587,jtamburi,A Fairy Tale,5,16 April 1999,"American History X is basically a fairy tale.  It is a film about one man's implausible 3-step transformation from a naive high-school kid to a white-supremist Nazi and leader of a skinhead tribe, to an honest caring upstanding citizen who only wants to do the right thing for his family and society at large.  Like I said, a fairy tale.  I won't  reveal any more of the ending that wasn't already revealed on the preview.  Basically it's a mixed happy/sad ending, where the ""happy"" part is that the main character finally comes to terms with who we was, how evil he was, the way his evilness has negatively influenced the lives of other people, and is able to write a nice cheery new chapter in his life.  And all this happens in a short 4 years.What gets me is how unbelievably intelligent and level-headed the main character (played by Ed Norton) is, and how completely silly his transformation into a skinhead really is.Meanwhile his kid brother (played by Ed Furlong) who is also reasonably smart, follows in his brother's footsteps like a zombie.  Norton's character is clearly free-thinking and is not one to follow in other people's footsteps, while Furlong is just the opposite.  At least Furlong's character gives the impression that he might flip and go completely nuts at any given time, thereby adding some mystery to the film (Furlong is good at looking like a punk). But the reality is much more like a fairy tail.So basically the film doesn't know what it wants to be.  One the one hand, it deals with some incredibly moving race issues, and on the other hand we have a children's movie.I think The Chamber by John Grisham actually did a much better job at portraying a racist who slowly & reluctantly repents and finds the error in his ways, at the last possible moment.  At least in that film, we understand that we're dealing with someone who, at his core, is really not a very nice man.Just the opposite in X.(5 out of 10)",American History X

The company that made this movie completely mis-marketed this (just like Fight Club - but that's a different story), it was quite different than what I had envisioned and in turn made me think of this skinhead as a person and as a sympathetic character, credit Edward Norton's great acting. Myself being a black woman, this is quite a concept for me to admit. Seeing it again helped me formulate the opinion that all though it is flawed in some ways -  it seems that it is missing some scenes, like what else happened to Derek in prison his last few months and just who in the heck is this Cameron? (nice job with the make-up, I hardly recognized Stacey Keach) It has a an undeniable message that everyone should hear. Oh yeah, it was cool seeing Jennifer Lien as Derek's sister, Davina, in a post Star Trek Voyager role.",American History X
592,mobdick69,Edward Norton's greatest movie,10,7 January 2001,"I cant believe every time I watch this movie that it didnt get a single nomination for anything.  Ed Norton deserved no less than to WIN the Oscar for one of the best all around performances in movie history. His arc as a character was incredible and Norton was outstanding in every scene, he is truly the best of any actor under 40.  Frankly, the only reason I can think of for this movie not winning anything was the hoopla surrounding the directors atttempts to remove his name from this.  It must have cast a negative halo around the movie.  Kaye must be an idiot or a real egomaniac though, because this movie is out and out marvelous and this should be required reading in schools, just so people can see both sides of the race issue that is very much a problem with the youth of this nation.",American History X
593,Umblezi,This is a masterpiece,10,1 February 2000,"This is the most intense film I have ever seen. My favourite actor is, and always has been Marlon Brando. After him, it's Kevin Spacey and Edward Norton, and a large void between them and any other actor today. This is the first movie I ever saw with Norton and I was blown away. Unfortunately, I only saw it on video, but I did not take my eyes off the screen for a moment. The movie is brilliantly made, but even so, Norton adds something to it, which I now know he adds to all his films, which makes it stick in your memory. And I am so glad that he did not sell himself out, by doing worthless movies- he is now about thirty and done only a handful of films. I am very much anticipating the film he is set to do with Brando in the future, THE SCORE, and if Norton, Brando and Spacey ever appear in a film together I guarantee it will be a masterpiece. Anyone giving this film any less than 8 out of 10 has cannot see brilliance when it presents itself so intensely.",American History X

It brings us the subconscious racial divide in everyone so clear and crisp, that it makes one question himself (herself) of his or her real stand on the issue of racial prejudice.
Tony Kaye has done such a fine job, that I must kiss his hand and worship him forever for his direction in just this one movie. He's managed to deliver a 'message', managed to keep the flow so smooth, managed to keep the story balanced, managed to tell us a very convincing story without compromising on any of the values that film has set out on. In short, he's given us one of the best movies at a time when we are fed on half-baked and good-for-nothing garbage.Of course it's sad to note that some people have used the movie as propaganda machine to their own ends and the dialogues, quoted in the wrong forum, for the wrong reasons (against the very spirit of the movie). Whether or not people have learnt lessons from the movie, I hope it's definitely shaken a lot of folks and made a few THINK.The acting is top class across actors and a special note of appreciation for Ed Norton's outstanding acting; it's hard to believe it was not recognized. The fact that Roberto Benigni won the Oscar over Norton is hard for ME to digest.All in all a movie to watch. Never miss this one...10/10",American History X

Although I had heard about it, I knew little more than the premise of the movie and expected a clichéd story of reform and self-discovery. This movie is...incredible. The acting is superb, with Edward Norton's performance as the despicable, yet highly intelligent and convincing Derek Vinyard who ultimately undergoes a transformation that is so realistically and emotionally portrayed. Other cast members such as Edward Furlong gave great performances as well. This is one of those movies that really gets inside of your skin and stirs you up with emotion, as you are presented with two sides of the battle between racism and acceptance in all its gory detail, with heated debate and physical violence that captures the spirit of this film. Not much more I can say but to recommend it to all viewers mature enough to handle it (the R rating was given for a very good reason).",American History X

599,TTaipale,Touching story of hatred and racism,9,22 February 2002,"As racism and neo-nazis spread across Europe this is definitely the movie to watch. It tells the story of two brothers Derek and Daniel. The older brother, Derek, is convicted because he killed two black men trying to steal his car. They are both neo-nazis and the movie tells a touching story of Derek trying to get out of the the circle and Danny being pulled in to that same gang. The movie sends out the message, which we sometimes forget in the today's society. We are all different but we are also all equal. You should not judge the other by the color of the skin. What really amazes me that atleast in the film, the neonazis idolize Adolf Hitler, the same person that their grandparents fought in the WWII. The movie has a really strong and good story and the actors do great job. I have seen Edward Norton in such film as Fight Club and Rounders and I knew that he is a brilliant actor and again he is great playing the part of Derek Vinyard. Edward Furlong I have seen in Terminator 2 and Pet Semetary 2 and he does a good part in this film as well. I wonder why we don't see in other movies as well.

I highly recommend American History X for all mature teens through adults.  9/10.",American History X
601,retasulover,What Has America Come To?,9,20 February 2009,"American History X is definitely a film that will make the question come to mind. Just what has America come to? When your children can be so easily manipulated by stereotypes from others, and the media, and then turn that manipulation into a full blown belief, you just know that something is wrong.Edward Norton delivers a phenomenal role as Derek Vinyard, a young Venice Beach resident who transforms into a heartless and ruthless skinhead after his racist father is killed by a black man while trying to put out a fire in South Central Los Angeles.Edward Norton, while not regularly taking a villainous role, truly comes across as an nonnegotiable force of prejudiced evil in this film, even adorned with a memorable and gigantic swastika tattoo on his chest. Joining the misled youth during his tirade of hatred is the long lost Stacy Keach from M.A.S.H. as his white supremacist mentor, Cameron Alexander, who could very well become Venice Beach's own version of Adolf Hitler, a sly and evil man who uses his words and connections to reach out to frustrated youths, and rally them to his pure Nazi-esquire campaign.Also joining the pure white army is ""My Name Is Earl""s very own Ethan Supplee as the massive and short-tempered skinhead Seth, who can't help but gnaw away at all the viewers nerves, as he takes his hatred on other white people, rather than ONLY non-whites.Terminator 2's Edward Furlong also delivers a powerful role as Derek's impressionable younger brother Danny, who is well on his way to becoming just like his brother.This film is highly praised in my eyes, as it displays just how destructive racism is, not only to strangers, but also to those closest to you. A truly horrific scene, that will no doubt last forever, is when a furious Edward Norton drags a wounded black gangster to the concrete curb in front of his house, and mercilessly curb stomps his skull to the ground, and then grinning innocently as he is taken away by the police, as if he has done nothing wrong.Only until it is too late, and he is in prison, does Derek slowly realize the mistakes he has made in his life, especially after he is viciously raped in the showers by the local Aryan Brotherhood, and brought to his senses by his black former teacher.Upon returning to the real world, Derek tries his best to try and bring the old Danny back to his family, as the new skinhead Danny is very quickly going down the same road Derek once went down. Needless to say, his former Nazi friends do NOT take Derek's change of heart well at all.In a climactic, and earth shattering finale, Derek finally convinces Danny not to follow in his brother's footsteps, and they both decide to begin a hate-free life, but only to have Danny mercilessly gunned down in his school bathroom by a young black kid.Truly, hatred only begets hatred, and that lesson is very vividly shown in this masterpiece. American History X is a film that is to be seen by everyone at least once. If you have a family member, or friend, who is slowly succumbing, or showing signs of prejudice or hatred towards non white people, and beginning to take Nazi-like beliefs to heart, show them this film ASAP, so they'll know not to make those mistakes.American History X is truly a classic, and is to be respected as such.",American History X
602,fembot1005,Amazing Drama!,9,18 March 2014,"First off the most obvious thing about this movie that makes it so great is the acting, and I don't mean just Edward Norton I mean the entire cast. The girl from Charmed (the movie) and The Water Boy is really great though I can never remember her name. The leader of the racists, the fat racist guy (also the friend in My Name is Earl I'm pretty sure), Elliott Gould, the mom and even the little brother (and teen aged and child actors are usually awful to me). The cast of this movie is really great and make it so believable.That said obviously Edward Norton is the heart of this film. He is really awesome in this movie and gets the audience to both loathe how horrible he is but also sympathize and pity him and the life he has led and want him to earn redemption.I don't want to give away the ending but the movie is a great drama with a fantastic climax and Norton deserved the Oscar for his portrayal without a doubt!",American History X
603,addiewhiz,Edward Norton is the saving grace for this film,7,23 April 2012,"On my gallant, noble, and impossible quest to see every movie that has ever been deemed to be good, I happened on the title American History X. It was indeed a good film, but that's just it. It was only a good film. It did not give me chills or astound me like many of the other great films that I have seen.The most wonderful aspect of this film was the acting. When I heard what the film was about, and that Edward Norton was going to play the raving Neo-Nazi brother Derek Vinyard, I was initially disappointed, due to Norton's style of largely plain and deadpan delivery. I didn't think he had it in him to play a raving, deluded racist. I am glad to say that Norton's performance proved me very wrong. The way in which he delivered his lines was so convincing, that I actually experienced some amount of anger at his character, and not just the ideas he espoused. The convoluted logic behind his racism was so thought out and realistic, that it made it very easy to see how people who hold racial prejudices come to hold them. In addition, Ethan Suplee demonstrated impressive versatility in his acting. The first time I saw Suplee in a film was in Remember the Titans, where he played the slightly comical offensive lineman Louie Lastik. His character in this film, Seth, was incredibly dark, singing his White Supremacist songs and saluting Hitler. In general, the acting absolutely blew me away.The downside to this movie is that the plot sets itself up for much depth in the story, but never takes the dive. In the beginning, Danny's teacher tells Danny that he will be a part of a new class, called American History X, designed to prevent him from going down the same Nazi path as his older brother. This is the title of the film. I think it's fair to expect the film to go into significant depth as to what the substance of the class is, and what Danny would have been learning in the class. But, because of the nature of the film, we never find out. I'm not saying that the film should be changed. I'm just saying that the writers of the film should have made it such that Danny was just given an extra assignment by his teacher, as opposed to having an entirely new course constructed for him.Another aspect that goes undeveloped is the nature of the character, Lamont, who is Derek's Black friend in prison. Lamont is largely responsible for Derek's epiphany that Black people are, in fact, treated unfairly by law enforcement, and further more that racial hatred is a wasteful way of life. With such an important role in the story, one would think that Lamont's character would have been better explained. Instead, we never learn anything about him, other than the reason that he is in prison.Another large missing link in this story is the reason for Derek's racism. In Danny's paper, he writes that Derek claims his racism was rooted in his father's murder. Danny claims to believe that his hatred for non-Whites began at an earlier age, when his father told him about affirmative action policies. The film introduces this question, which seems to be a large and significant question, but really only spends about five minutes answering it.The final large missing puzzle piece, which is a problem that is slightly difficult to solve it whether or not Derek reverts to a life of racism at the end of the film. Not to spoil the film completely, but something happens to Danny at the very end of the film that would force Derek to question what he had learned from his experiences in prison. But, the film simply leaves us hanging there. We do not know whether we should feel happy or sad, for Derek, at the end of this film, when we feel the need to feel some sort of emotion in that regard. There really isn't a way to solve this problem, but it is worth noting.Overall, this is a good film, with excellent character portrayal. However, it definitely leaves some questions unanswered.",American History X
604,gr8one232,"Norton's best performance, but he flies solo in this one",8,5 July 2004,"This film is easily the best performance of Ed Norton's great career thusfar. He shows his blue collar side that will work hard to perfect himself for any role. The problem here is that the rest of the film lags behind his talent. He has little help from the supporting cast, a poor director, and a very soft script in some areas. My biggest problem with the film is that the story was told with flashbacks. We miss out on a great opportunity to grow and change with Derek. The prison scenes are all but pointless, since we already know he comes out reformed and non-violent. Why should we bother watching the middle of the movie? I would have liked this movie a lot more if it was done in linear fashion. The movie also builds itself on shockingly violent and strong scenes. These are done very well (the rape, the curb incident, the rant by Derek on the news after his father is killed, etc.) However, when we aren't watching one of these scenes, the movie doesn't have much to offer.The only member of the cast who does well in her role besides Norton is Beverly D'Angelo as the troubled mom. The Nazi influences in Derek and Danny's lives are all clichéd characters that add nothing to the film (Ethan Suplee, Faruiza Balk, Stacey Keach). Ed Furlong didn't sell me on his character being a potentially violent skinhead. Also the attempts at building up the fraternal bond between Derek and Danny failed. It seemed like Norton was carrying Furlong through the whole scene at the diner. Overall i still gave the movie an 8. It seems like I've bashed it here, but Norton was good enough to wow me, and part of me thinks we had no more character development BECAUSE the director wanted Norton to carry the movie.Not a bad idea in the least. I was also a fan of the ending, the message was a simple one, but one that I happen to agree with",American History X

I understand that it's an acquired taste but everything about it just seems so real. It helps to know a little bit about the world history and not be close minded to things that actually happened. The characters are just so rightfully played and the voice of derek when he tells how things are and gives you a glimpse of things that are going on, wow! it just puts the whole situation into perspective, he is seems so calm and collected and such a little guy but really he has a huge heart and a point to make. I have cried, laughed and been a little dismayed with parts of this movie, but never would i ever not watch it. I recommend this movie to people old enough to understand that meaning of it, the lines shaded behind the looks and actions of the characters.

Another perfect performance by Edward Norton his character shows the most depth of any on-screen. The film speaks volumes about racism and prejudice in general. I loved the idea of doing all the flashbacks in black and white. Although I realize that this is done in a lot of ""flashback"" type films, given the whole theme of the film I found it especially fitting. The characters in the movie steal your heart, you spend half the movie hating them, and the other half feeling immensely sorry for their closed minded views.The only reason that this movie didn't get an 8 or 9 rating is the ending.

I just saw it today, so I realize I shouldn't be writing a review since the movie is so fresh on my mind, but I couldn't help it. I am just so excited about how good this movie, the way it shows both sides, for Neo-Nazi and opposed Neo-Nazi, and the way he got from one opinion to the other (prison). Not only this, but when it shows him with the Neo-Nazi's it makes it look like Nazi's are good and it sticks you in his shoes, it evenly plays victorious music during the racial basketball that kicked the blacks off his court and showed it like it was a good thing he did and he was hero, then it goes from B & W to color and shows he sees more clearly at what he did. Not to mention my favorite part of the movie, the ending, but for those who have not seen it I will not waste it.",American History X
608,mic check,X marks the spot,8,11 May 2000,"So much is being written about the battles between New Line Cinema and Director Tony Kaye over his debut feature film that hardly anything is being said about the film itself. That's too bad because American History X, despite a few hiccups, is an intense, tautly written, and beautifully lensed trumpet song heralding the arrival of a formidable new talent.
Danny (Furlong) is an impressionable youth who greatly admires and looks up to his brother Derek (Norton). Trouble is, Derek is the leader of an organized skinhead group. One evening, Derek goes on a rage and murders two black men. Three years later, on the day of Derek's release from prison, Danny turns in a book report on Mein Kampf and lands in the principal Sweeney's (Brooks) office. As punishment, Sweeney demands Danny rewrite the paper tracing his brother's path to murder. Told partially in flashback American History X, grapples with serious issues of hatred, racism, and whether or not such deep-seated resentment can be turned back.Kaye directed commercials for Volvo, Volkswagen, and Nike (not to mention Soul Asylum's award-winning ""Runaway Train"" video) and much of the film features commercial-like moments: long lingering camera sweeps, plenty of slo-mo, light bursts, and inspired camera angles. Kaye manages to capture some memorable images. Still, despite this, at some points it gets a little tedious. Some of the emotional impact is washed away from certain scenes simply because the camera just won't stand still.Another wonderful surprise is the crispness of the black and white footage Kaye shot. Like Pleasantville, after extended periods of black and white, when color does reappear, it seems all the more vibrant.Maybe Kaye's version would have addressed this but the picture does have its share of problems. Will working in a prison laundry alongside a chummy black guy really change such deep-rooted hatred and fear in Derek? Wouldn't the skinheads attack Derek after his release from prison and beating of the white supremacist leader? Did his mother have to be sick? Couldn't we have seen a little more struggle from Danny trying to ditch his extremist ways other than just crying on his brother's shoulder? Did we really need to see another prison rape scene?Despite a mixed bag of problematic moments and inspired genuis, American History X is worth your time if for no other reason than to check out Norton and Furlong's taut performances. Norton never looked so menacing, nor showed such a proclivity toward evil doing. Avery Brooks, Fairuza Balk, and a surprisingly effective Beverly D'Angelo also turned in some nice (if uneven) performances.It's unfortunate that Kaye feels like he was unable to complete American History X. Much of the film feels great but there are moments of stumbling about. Perhaps Kaye would've fixed those. Or, maybe not. In any case, the ultimate message is diluted because of the inconsistencies. This is one of those tricky flicks you'll either love or hate and that is part of its charm.",American History X

Not only did this movie tell the inside story of militant white supremacist groups in America, but it showed the destruction of a blue-collar white family due to the Neo-Nazi organization.

617,jon-larsen,American History X,10,6 October 2011,"Film Review American History X is about a skinhead called Derek Vinyard. He brutally kills two black guys and goes to prison for only three years. His brother, Danny, who worships Derek, was the only one who saw him kill those guys, but he didn't testify. In prison he slowly befriends a black guy. This black guy, Lamont, tells Derek that he went for prison for 6 years because he stole a television and accidentally dropped it on the foot of a police officer. Derek realizes that black people and all the foreigners are not treated fairly. He also realizes that what he has been doing is completely wrong. After three years when he's released, he notices that his little brother, Danny, is following his footsteps. Derek teaches him a life lesson and tells him that he's choosing the wrong path in life. This is an amazing film. The director, the cinematographers and actors did an amazing job. I thought it was a fantastic idea to shoot the film in color and black and white. When you shoot films in color it's to get a more natural image of life and black and white is to express the realism in films. That's mostly used in documentaries and films that are based on real life. Although, back in the very old days, almost every film were filmed in black and white. I also loved the idea of filming the flashbacks in black and white, because Derek regrets his past and the color white symbolizes innocence, which I assume is not the right symbolism in this case, but it does symbolize for some common sense, although black symbolizes something more depressing like death, grief and melancholy.That's not the main reasons why I love this film. The main reason why I loved the film is the story and the message. The film does an amazing job to show what's right and wrong and the way it builds up to the message is just genius. It's a story of hope and even people who have so much hate in their minds can be flipped. This is a film that everyone must watch and I hope it touches everyone who watches this film just as much as me, and I hope they learn a lesson for life.I have seen many films in my life but there are not many films that touches me so deeply like this film.

618,blawson2010,American History X shows the hold hate can have over people,10,27 September 2009,"American History X is not a movie you will enjoy because its not a movie that you are meant to enjoy. It is extremely graphic and violent, but that is where it draws its power. This movie is meant to teach you a lesson and it does so in a very powerful way. Edward Norton plays a Neo-Nazi who is blaming everything wrong with America on immigrants and people who aren't white. This movie centers on Norton's character's racism and that is a main theme of the movie. Most people would draw that this movie shows us that hatred of other races is wrong but i think it is just using an extreme circumstance and extreme hatred to convey a different but similar theme. This theme is summer up in the final sequence of the film; ""Life is too short to live it full of hate""This movie is brilliantly shot and edited with music that wraps you into the film. Norton is brilliant as always and draws you into the movie, just as a good actor should. Don't watch American History X if your are looking for a movie with a feel good moment at the end, watch it and appreciate what the film is trying to show you.",American History X
619,exa56,A masterpiece! Truly one of the best film I have ever seen,10,26 January 2006,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",American History X
620,decoconnor5,Powerful,10,22 January 2010,"I seen this film a few years ago and while i enjoyed it I didn't appreciate it as much. I watched it again recently and I was blown away by what I saw, shocked even. The story itself is so relevant and honest that it hits you hard on so many levels. Its disturbing to realise that there is such hatred in the world. Norton delivers a career defining performance as does Furlong. The rest of the cast are all solid and altogether deliver a powerful piece of cinema. At times throughout the film I had to say to myself did that really happen, is such brutality real? But beyond the violence lies a problem that has been looked at one thousand different times and we still haven't found an answer. Perhaps there never will be an answer, but what we are shown in this film doesn't need an answer, it just needs to be witnessed to be believed. A masterpiece.",American History X
621,misterkevinoh,Are you serious,4,9 September 2013,"Okay, I get this movie was trying to talk about important subjects about racism, how people are conditioned to hate others, etc blah blah... But this movie... this movie fails so hard at everything it's actually astonishing how bad it got. Don't get me wrong, it had a strong opening, and a lot of the visuals are very striking. Perhaps the most powerful image is of Edward Norton walking towards the camera, hair buzz cut and swastika tattoo popping against his skin. There was good stuff like that in the movie. Bad stuff was that this movie should've been about the younger brother. I mean, it starts with him narrating, it opens with him. Is he not the main character? Why is Ed Norton here stealing every scene like it's his movie? Get the eff out of here Norton. Uninstall yourself from this film. It becomes glaringly clear that this just another dramatic vehicle for Norton's career, and any statement it was trying to make was lost in that horrendous ending. I have never been so disconnected to an ending of a film, but this movie tries *so hard* to have this bull dramatic ending where the little brother gets shot, and I couldn't care less. I could not care less about this guy, his dead brother, and I blame the movie for creating a complete emotional dissonance within me. Eff you American History X, I thought you cared.",American History X
622,buskk7642,The most powerful film concerning racism ever made!,10,21 February 2005,"American History X: Starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks and Beverly D'Angelo Written by David McKenna, Directed by Tony Kaye (New Line Cinema, 1998)****/ out of 4.From its brutal and powerful opening scene till the bitter end, American History X is a rare film that crosses the line between cinema and art. Through its bold and fearless acting (especially Edward Norton, absolutely brilliant) clever writing and masterful direction, American History X challenges the viewer to face the truth about hate in today's society. From the beginning of his career, Edward Norton has continually progressed as an actor constantly challenging himself artistically with projects that push the envelope of mainstream film-making and American History X is the prime example of his dedication. Norton plays Derek Vineyard, a former neo-Nazi skin head who just served three years in prison for killing a black gang member in self defense. Seeing the error in his ways, he returns from prison reformed vowing to stop his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down a similar path. From the beginning, Norton is nothing short of brilliant in his Oscar nominated role. His dedication was both emotional and physical; Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle for the role and is covered in tattoos, including a swastika. His presence and intensity command the screen so convincingly that the viewer needs to be reminded they're watching a film, not a documentary. In one of the film's most powerful scenes, Derek is talking to his brother about what happened to him in prison and what changed him. Norton uses body language and eye movement to create the most memorable monologue in recent film history. He looks at Danny with such conviction and says ""Looking back I can't believe I bought into all this s#$@, all this hate, this anger. It's just because I was p------ off, and I'm tired of being p------ off, Danny, it's not worth it."" Aside from Norton, the supporting cast even the most trivial roles are top notch. Edward Furlong is perfect as Derek's brother Danny who's confused about his views and searching for truth in the ugly world of racism consumed by propaganda and contradiction. The rest of the cast including Guy Torry, Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks as Derek's black High School English teacher who ends up mentoring him and steering him down the right path.The central point of the entire film is that hate and anger is nothing but baggage. The script carried this out with it's pace, intense dialogue and construction but the film needed a director with a strong visual sense to show the viewer what hate does to a society, a family and a man. Tony Kaye not only directed the film but also operated the camera for the film and was the lead cinematographer. Visually, the film is a flat out masterpiece from start to finish. By using color changes, time sequencing, and flashbacks, the film uses visuals to tell the story and metaphorically shed light on racism.When we see Derek out of prison, the film is shown in color to show how he sees everything clearly. While Derek is in prison and while he still had racist views, the film is shown in black and white to symbolize how he and other racists did not see minorities as people, just statistics. In the film's most beautiful scene, Derek returns home from prison and has reformed in his ways. He spends time with Danny and one by one, they take down all the posters and banners promoting racism and hate hanging in their room. Derek quietly out of the room to take a shower. The lush cinematography captures every single water drop as it falls off his body. The scene is crosscut with a flashback of Derek and Danny together on the beach as young children. The scene suggests all he has to live for and his love for his brother. At the end of scene, Derek steps out of the shower refreshed, as if he's just washed away his sins and has forgiven himself for his past. He looks in the mirror and slowly places his right hand over his heart, covering his swastika tattoo. Though very little is spoken, this scene is at the heart of the film's purpose and passion.The reason the film is so brilliant and why it works is the way the script is handled and translated to screen. The film proves its point about hate and anger through pacing, clever dialogue and offers an intelligent point of view on controversial issues impacting today's society. Issues such as gang violence, the job market and the Rodney King trials are topics concerning Americans today. The white supremacists are viewed as highly educated people with intelligent opinions concerning the issues of minorities in our society. The film looks at these points objectively and suggests that while these points are good, they are biased, unfair and illogical considering the basis for these arguments are hate and anger.American History X is quite simply the best film concerning racism ever made. It's more than just a great piece of cinema; it's a work of art. Through the powerful performances, masterful direction and thought provoking script, American History X is a testament to the truth about hate in our society and our world.",American History X
623,iamggn,Has Anything You've Done Made Your Life Better?,8,3 April 2014,"American History X is stirringly thought-provoking. It serves as a wake up call for the masses that differentiate on the basis of any particular entity.The movie reels off the story about a Neo-Nazi skinhead who was once against the black progeny, but later figures to prevent his brother from choosing the same path after getting a reality check. The movie is incorporated with peculiarities of anger, violence, compassion and honorable philosophy. It possesses an ideal run time of 2 hours and manages to blow away. Also, an unforeseeable climax diversifies the movie making it even more disparate.They probably couldn't have assembled a better cast. Edward Norton, who played the lead role was undeniably striking, no wonder he got nominated for the 'Best Actor in a Leading Role' category at the Academy awards. Edward Furlong was simply alluring while enacting an integral character of the story line. Greater supporting roles played by Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks were commendable. Accompanying them were Ethan Suplee and Guy Torry, they pulled of a splendid task as well. Minor roles impersonated by Jennifer Lien and Elliot Gould too were above average.Film Direction was brilliantly executed. Consorted by David McKenna's screenplay, Tony Kaye, the director, doubtlessly managed to produce the necessary ambiance. Editing sector was absolutely praiseworthy. Likewise, music by Anne Dudley was pleasing. Cinematography was garden-variety.All things considered, the film is top notch. Controversial yet soothing. Violent yet placid. In a single word, EPIC. Watch it and I'm certain that it will leave you thinking about racial abuse and its intracacies.",American History X

The storyline is about a nazi skinhead, who tries and saves his brother from a life of destruction and joining up with a nazi group. This happens everywhere, and for the story to be brought to life from our education and entertainment was outstanding. Edward Norton plays such a critical role, and is so believable as the characters its scary. An excellent production, turns so many heads as the gripping and brutal truth comes out about how some people think and act. This film is truly a great one, and extremely pleasing. The direction is fantastic, and acting is second to none, because its so gritty there are no over dramatics. American History X is a classic, it is a must watch.",American History X

Edward Norton was excellent as Derek, the bitter racist older brother whose anger and frustration over the death of his firefighter father was eating him alive. It contains very strong language and violence, so be warned. The supporting cast is excellent, too. Edward Furlong plays his younger brother and Beverly D'Angelo, his mother.",American History X
626,shortyrags,Haunting albeit Unrealistic,7,22 July 2008,"Tony Kaye offers a dramatic film in the form of American History X, on the topic of racism, presented through the marginalized perspectives of Neo-Nazi nationalists. The story centers upon a bright, intelligent man Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who unyieldingly displays his hate and disgust for other races. He and his group of friends repeatedly make life difficult for other races living in the area. Their actions finally climax when Derek goes too far and has to serve time in prison, leaving his younger brother, Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong, to the will of the Neo-Nazi group. The story is powerful and features ups and downs in the characters that add an air of humanity to these otherwise inhumane Neo-Nazi racists. The characters, for the most part, are grotesque and in certain cases, utmost embodiments of our own insecurities towards different cultures and lifestyles, initiating inner turmoil sometimes. The film sometimes plays off these fears a little too much and does not offer them in a more objective and subtle way.The film takes place in a surreal setting where there is constant conflict between differing races. The focus here is on tensions between the Neo-Nazis and African-Americans living in the same neighborhood, and at times the film tends to become a little one-sided. It feels like some of the targets of Derek's horrific actions are simply victims, when in the grand scheme of things, they likely harbor similar feelings towards Derek's group and commit similar actions in retribution. Moreover, Derek's transformation in prison is brushed over rather quickly and uses one or two powerful scenes to imply a lifetime of change. It doesn't really work honestly and the film loses a lot of its credibility there.The acting here is decent with Edward Norton standing head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. Danny Vinyard, despite arguably being the main character, seems like he's missing in certain scenes when Norton simply takes over. Edward Furlong does look the part but he doesn't act the part extremely well. Having said that, he does a decent enough job to propel the film forward, even with his annoying monologues that lack any spirit. The rest of the cast does well with what its given with Ethan Suplee playing Derek's leach-like and terrifying friend. Even William Russ makes a strong guest appearance in a flashback sequence that explains many of the present scenarios.The visual style is interesting here with color scenes meant to represent Derek's changed lifestyle in the present, and stark black-and-white shots used in flashback sequences to juxtapose the two races against one another. The idea, while pretty good on paper, ends up coming on a little too strong in the film, and does end up hurting the film, even though it tries to add depth. There are several haunting scenes here that the camera crew has taken from the script and captured well in film. The score is mostly two-sided, using dark and low notes for the past, and higher pitched notes to indicate a possible, brighter future. It works pretty well but like the difference in color and black-and-white, it sometimes goes for too much, especially towards the end of the film.American History X is a film about racism that is meant to inspire disgust for those portrayed on screen but also perhaps in ourselves when we sometimes shelter similar feelings. The film is literally a little too black and white, offering little gray space between, on the topic of racism. Unfortunately, certain things aren't always as simple as the film makes them out to be and Derek's transformation is both too unrealistic and short. Edward Norton does an incredible job here but the rest of the cast members, with a few exceptions, suffer greatly, and consequently, so does the film. Overall, the film sends out a powerful message, using powerful camera shots and characters to deliver it to the audience. It is grisly and gritty at times, giving us an extreme and bitter taste of Neo-Nazi racism. However, the film has too many flaws in its execution for it to be considered a classic of 90's cinema.",American History X

The cinematography is amazing each shot is brilliant and the way it flicks between monochrome and colour for flashbacks is very different to any other movie.

However, when I went on the internet and saw how good people said it was, I had to see it. I was memorized the entire movie.I have seen my share of Edward Norton movies, but not only was this one the best, but I have never seen one actor put so much emotion and care into one film. Edward Furlong also showed the best change in a performance that I have ever seen. This movie is fantastic, but I will admit, it is hard to watch at some times. How nobody won an Oscar for this film is beyond me. See this movie, you will not be disappointed, I guarantee it. I guarantee if you see this film, which is the greatest movie ever in my opinion, you'll say the same things I am saying. It doesn't matter if you are young or old, black or white, male or female, this is the best drama you will ever see.

Good to see Beverly D'Angelo playing against her ""Nat'l Lampoon Vacation"" role.As to the movie as a whole, however, I felt it tried to pack too much into too little time.  I wasn't as convinced with the transformationS of Norton's character as I might have been.  I also felt that the ending was unnecessary drama.  Rather than conveying a message of hope and transformation, we're left, I guess, with the adage that ""violence begets violence.""

633,Reviewer,The acting was as great as the flaws (Spoilers Included),8,30 September 1999,"Please note that these comments include spoilers, so if you have not seen this movie do not read on.The acting in this movie as have been already said was great - enough said I think. Of course this was helped by a great script as well in many respects. However this movie should not be regarded as a classic because of the following flaws in plot design and characterisation. 1) At the beginning of the movie, Derek seems to have a valid right to protect his property against those black people who were stealing from him. It would have been best if the movie depicted the black people just sitting on his wall and talking and then Derek got mad and did what he did.2) The middle part of the movie is a complete disaster. The prison scenes were the biggest let down in the movie without a doubt. How Derek quickly made friends with that black convict is unrealistic considering that he rejected mixing with the other blacks in the prison. His conversion and realisation of his criminal activity was too quick and non-existent or simply to unrealistic. When Derek is raped in the shower we see that he has suffered physically, but mentally we do not see how he copes with this harrowing situation. 3) When Derek makes his racist arguments there is no counter comments made throughout the movie, therefore the viewer is totally confused how Derek could have changed.4) When Derek slaps the face of the leader of the Neo-Nazi organisation, we do not see the leader reacting against Derek afterwards by going around to Derek's place (like in many scenes in the Godfather movies) with his henchmen. Rather we get an unrealistic ending which involves a side incident that occurs in the movie, rather than the main purpose.This movie is worth watching, but misses out on the classical status because of its flaws - hence no best picture norm in the oscars. Only if these flaws could have been dealt with then it would have been one of the greatest movies of all time.",American History X
634,PrinceMishkin,"A daring subject, with fine acting, but ultimately botched.",6,27 March 1999,"In the early 1980's it was regarded as a great novelty when the man behind the Hovis commercial directed a hit film. At the time the two worlds were still regarded as miles apart; once one took the soup from Kleenex or Curly Wurly, one was cursed to walk their earth for eternity, with no hope of escape. Ridley Scott broke that mould, with the help of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and his brother Tony. More recently, they have been joined by video directors like David Fincher. All share a common visual vocabulary; whilst many have made effective films, there is a cold polish to their work, a discipline of image over content which has often been counterproductive.American History X, whilst in many ways an admirable film, is a case in point. Tony Kaye is a highly respected director of both commercials and videos - the British Rail advertisement with the snoozing sepia people is his - and it shows. Fish eye lenses, tasteful monochrome, slow motion, faces in deep shadow, all are used and often used effectively. However one is constantly waiting for a silky voice to try and sell us perfume. Since Kaye is his own director of photography, all responsibility for this lies with him.The film tells the story of two brothers involved with Neo-Nazi skinheads in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles. Derek (Edward Norton), has just been released from prison after serving time for killing a black man. Danny (Edward Furlong), idolises his elder brother and has followed in his footsteps, his room bedecked with Nazi regalia. This is a very sensitive theme and it is extremely well played by the two Edwards. Norton's Oscar nomination is well deserved, but Furlong is no less impressive, he manages to convey the avalanche of confusion that engulfs a teenager. His racism is part of a pack mentality, one sees clearly that freed from the malign forces around him, he could escape and the humanity in him could blossom.The film dares to make both brothers attractive personalities, it dares to allow us to root for them. Elsewhere, the filmmakers are not so brave. On the side of righteousness there is Sweeney, a black school principal with ""two PhD's"", who goes out of his way to assist both Derek and Danny. This really is far too schematic, that the Nazis see the error of their ways because of a saint is much too easy. If there were a Sweeney in every high school, then the problem could  be solved over night. Similarly if all right wing leaders were as transparently evil as Stacy Keach's Cameron, then the Dannys of the world would be fairly safe from their grasp. Keach plays him as a cackling maniac, complete with scary scar; he belongs in an underwater base, cradling a white cat. As the electoral success of people like former KKK member David Dukes has shown, white supremacists are capable of appearing just as suburban and normal as Tony Blair. It is there that the real danger lies for America, not with demagogic caricatures.The process of Derek's political development is also rather cheesy. His dad warned him about affirmative action so he became suspicious of Sweeney's liberalism, his dad gets murdered by a drug dealer so he becomes a Nazi, he goes to prison and meets a nice black bloke, sees the error of his ways and changes his mind. This is the sort of clunky emotional exposition that used to define the character arcs of guest stars in Little House on the Prairie. Similarly, the many intriguing moral and political issues are not demonstrated dramatically, but are explicitly discussed in a series of set pieces over dinner. This is a shame since most of the time writer David McKenna delivers a very controlled and well structured piece of work. He avoids a neat narrative line and moves comfortably backwards and forwards through time.There is also a very sure sense of place, the Venice Beach locations lend the film an enigmatic feel. This is an environment which straddles race and class. Unlike the urban jungles of the industrial cities of the East, Venice has great natural beauty, the Pacific opens and closes the film. Yet man makes his own ugliness, the meanness of the human spirit is everywhere. There are very few American films which have so convincingly created such a dark nether world, otherwise ignored by mainstream media.And yet, Hollywood sensibilities do permeate the picture. In the end all it takes for Derek to convince Danny of the error of his ways is for him to tell him about the nice black bloke in prison; a sequence that is both schematic and dramatically moribund. This sums up so much of what is frustrating about the film, it is skilfully made but has little flavour of original talent, it is brave but not brave enough to matter.",American History X

I was not loking for any kind of solution to the racism problem, BUT the movie left me feeling empty and asking myself: What's the point? racism and hate are bad - Duh! or was it racism and hate can be ugly - Duh!....a non-intelligent film that turned good thanks to Norton's acting ability.",American History X

The complexity of this family, how their bonds to one another, and their painful experience of the world tugged them in various directions, was very moving. The cast was INCREDIBLE!!! Especially Furlong and Most especially Norton. And the actor who portrayed Derek's laundry room co-worker was a standout in a very key role that was handled deftly and with a lot of humor.

Every time I came to the same conclusion. This can't be done better! I believe that this film really describes how the neo- Nazi ideology works. One man is a leader type. He is coward, cunning, eloquent and always very careful, keeping himself in the background. Seth, played by Ethan Suplee, is this person. We see how he manipulate young and easy impressionable boys and girls and builds up a hate within them. Derek Vinyard, a intelligent young man, became  a neo- Nazi because of something happening to him in the past. It is scary to see how a smart kid like him can develop such attitudes and values because of one event. And that his brother, Danny, looks up to him so much that he will do anything to get his approval. The plot and acting is magnificent! Edward Norton dives into his role and plays it so well it's scary! He makes the scene where he does the killing so real that it hurts to watch. The expression in his face when he is arrested is nothing but the best acting I've ever seen. Edward Furlong plays his confused and indifferent younger brother. He too is playing his role well. The movie puts an important theme up to debate, racism and neo- Nazism. It shows us how easy we can be manipulated to do horrible things and what the consequences can be.

The idea is interesting. However, it attempted to gather sympathy (and successfully) for the boy's plight by taking pot shots at easy targets. Derek is portrayed early in the movie preaching a succinct set of more than half-baked ideals which magically disintegrated with his ""change of heart"" in prison; when all his better angels kindly removed his indignation. The most insulting nugget of sanctimoniousness is Sweeny's comment ""Ask yourself one question...has this made your life better?"". Folks, when fighting for ANY cause, no-one ever expects the quality of one's life to improve. Did Ghandi's life improve by fasting?!Frankly, this is a very tough and serious subject that deserves more than a `change of heart'; it also demands a change of mind. It demands a journey of thought and reason. But in Hollywood who needs reason when you have tears, right? Thus we're left with a serious theme that is trampled by trite and exaggerated sensationalism.I believed at first that the sanctimoniousness was Tony Kaye's. But perhaps this touch is Edward Norton's who apparently monkey-ed around in post-production to the point where Tony Kaye wanted to use a pseudonym (I don't blame him). This wouldn't surprise me after seeing Norton's naive tear-jerker Keeping the Faith. Unfortunately, in Norton I'm ""Losing the Faith"".This movie could've been much better if it was created for grown ups. But then it would have to have been created by grown ups.",American History X

642,michaelescher,What is the big deal?,3,26 August 2001,"American History X is a predictable race drama with no real insight.  A second viewing on television tonight confirmed my initial feelings for me.  The change for the main character seemed unmotivated and a bit too quick.One thing that was interesting was the film's use of Venice and the seemingly benign streets of LA's Westside as the location for this melodrama to play out.  A more obvious choice would have been the American South.All in all without the fine contribution that Edward Norton makes, this would be a complete waste of time.",American History X
643,thecrow22,Norton Shows his worth once again.,10,15 October 2006,"After seeing Fight Club I knew that Edward Norton was something special, but after seeing this movie, I can say with utmost certainty that he is one of the greatest actors of American Cinema.Norton plays a former skinhead who is released from prison after serving 3 years for murder. He finds that his Brother(Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path that put him in jail. A lot of the story is told through flashbacks, which are in black and white. At first the black and white was a turnoff to me, but it grew on me and added to the way the story was told.Edward Furlong also does a stand-up role as Norton's younger brother. His voice narrates the movie from the point of view of a paper that he has to right for a special history class that he has to take because he is not working well in his class(Writing a paper on Mein Kampf will do that to you).This is one of the true movies in American Cinema that everyone should be required to see. It brings out a lot of truths in the Nazi movement in America and shows the horrors that it can bring. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong truly tell a story that is worth telling.10/10",American History X

Nothing good comes out of hating each other and being pissed off just for the sake of it. This movie is 23 years old and this racial nonsense continues to ruin people's lives even now. All this political stuff gets people excited, gets them ""a place to be"", a company to ""promote your opinion"", but does it make you happy at all? It takes everything from you giving nothing in return! Look at a case of Paul Miller, his life has been ruined by hateful dicks and now he became a hateful one too! People forget about their lives just to become ""active"" in something cruel and malevolent. This gotta stop!Just about the movie: incredible dialogue writing, impressive actors, very good music and main idea. Would recommend this kind, heartwarming masterpiece to everyone!",American History X

647,nogsy11,Some Legacies Must End,10,21 April 2005,"This movie is one of the best films dealing with Nazism and how hatred can destroy your life. Lots of people who have not seen this movie think it is pro Nazi belief. It is not that at all, it shows that racism and Anti-Semitism is a thing of the past and that hating people for their race and religion doesn't improve your life. It revolves around a very troubled and misguided young man Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton)who winds up killing two black kids and gets 3 years in jail for it. In the pen Derek learns that what he did had no good effect on his life at all and it didn't better his situation. The flash backs are so well done and the things Derek does and what happens to him really make you feel sorry for him.Derek's transformation from skin head to a good person does not come without a price. He has differences with other Nazis in jail which leads to him being their ""wife"". After this happens he realizes what wrongs he has done in his life and he now tries to fix them. When released from jail Derek realizes that his brother Danny is headed down the same path as him. This results in Derek ending his tenure with his Nazi friends and telling Danny why he had to do this. The end of the movie shows that old wounds do not heal and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it.The message they are trying to put forth in this film is that hate is just extra baggage and that we need to stop hating what we don't understand. It is a very compelling story and it makes you realize how much hate and resentment there still is in this world.",American History X
648,pjm-pjm,One of the most important films ever,9,27 April 2015,"American History X is not only an immaculately made tale of redemption and loss, excellently anchored by an Oscar worthy performance from Edward Norton, it is also vitally important to understanding the problems that still lie in America today. This film deals with the naivety of racism in America, and how young kids, like Edward Furlong's character Danny Vinyard, can be drawn into a life of hate without even realising what they're hating in the first place. Contrasting two periods of Derek Vinyard's (Norton) life, American History X shows the despair and anger that are bred from ignorant hate but also the enlightenment that is found when the hate is lost and the anger drains away. The pulsating rage of Vinyard's character as he lashes out at his mother's partner is painstakingly juxtaposed against his feelings of sorrowful regret, as he attempts to save his brother from making the same mistakes he did. The film's climax is almost Shakespearian in its poignancy, and it will leave you thinking for days. A masterpiece.",American History X
649,jordanand94,A film that continues to speak volumes to old and contemporary America,9,29 September 2018,"This film is one that I would recommend to all, as it is just too important to ignore.Racism, in all its disgusting and repulsive forms, is what built the United States, and it has unfortunately been ingrained into its fabric ever since, hovering over the country and continuing to derail its progress. Despite the progress the country has made in regards to annexing racism, it is still very much alive. This theme is very important to the film, as hate is passed down from generation to generation, in this case from the character of Derek Vinyard's father to Derek himself and ultimately to his brother, Danny.The performance of Edward Norton and his transition from an angry and hateful human being to one of remorse and love for his family is impeccable. His character understands the pain he has inflicted on his family due to his beliefs of hate and tribalism, and that is a very positive message to movie goers; the more you become desensitized to what minorities go through in this country and the more you hate, the more your life will crumble. It is tragic to see the impact Derek has had on his family, more importantly his brother, which ends up being very detrimental at the end of the film.One of the most moving scenes in the film is when Dr Sweeney visits Derek in prison, shortly after Derek has been raped by some of his fellow inmates. Derek is coming around now at this time about the errors of his ways, and Sweeney tells him, ""You have to ask yourself, Derek, has any of this, any of your actions and your racist beliefs, made your life better?"" Derek immediately responds ""No"" and begins to sob. Just a beautiful scene.One issue I had with the film was how Danny, the younger brother of Derek, was so quick to realize the error of his ways, his thoughts. It just wasn't believable, from having been so upset with Derek one minute upon learning he didn't buy into racist propaganda to the next second tearing down the racist posters in his room. You would think it would take a whole lot more for him to change his thinking, based upon Derek's experiences in prison.The slow motion scenes in this film are beautiful and the transition from black and white to color is also well crafted. The direction by Tony Kaye is exceptional.Ultimately, this film is monumental in its importance and relevance to society today and holds a very imperative message - the more you hate, the more detrimental consequences it will have on your life. Life is too short to hate, just love. No need to be angry all the time, we are all the same. 9/10",American History X
650,rcvilau,"If the dog is dangerous, it must be put to sleep.",10,17 November 2005,"I've read other comments and I think most people don't get the idea. Everybody writes ""This movie shows us that violence is not the way to deal with..."". In my opinion that's the mildest version of what this movie shows us, because American History X is about reality and in real life , if a dog bites you, you have to react. Nobody can sit and watch while their brothers, sisters, sons or daughters get wasted in the street. I think that every man would react violently to that. It's just that it doesn't happen to everyone.In other words, this movie shows us that it doesn't matter if you run, hide, or even if you try being nice to it, the rabid dog will try to bite you. So the only option is to fight for your life and for your family.I think this is Ed Norton's best role since Primal Fear. He is truly a Neo-Nazi and he leaves the impression that he believes in his preachings. The only part I couldn't get was Norton's 180 degree turn in prison. I mean, a man of his beliefs wouldn't just start crying in front of his sworn enemy and then give up all his life's ideas just because of a rape.All that said, I still rated this movie 10, because it's a true story of men and dogs.",American History X

I went into this movie with no prior knowledge about the little rift between the director, the lead or the production company. And I really do not care too much about what the problem was. This movie was brilliant, beautifully directed, and casted. Ed Norton soared as the lead, his contrasting attitudes were played well (and he looked incredible). Ed Furlong was excellent as a teen with some issues. He was mature and realistic. Avery was great as the saivor. The rest of the characters were just as good. The plot was excellent, and the ending was so powerful that I actually shed tears. (This from the girl who did not cry during Titanic). I've recommended this movie to many, and when they come back they call me to say thanks for such a great movie. People should see this movie, and the bitter fight going on behind the scenes should stay there. The highlight of this movie is the direction, , which leaves me wondering why it was such a big deal. Bottom Line: See it, it has all the elements of a great film. Ed Norton and the director should be nominated for something!!!",American History X
653,KenE,Absolute dreck,1,4 November 1998,"A few minor disconnects in the plot? Where are the connects? Everybody's just responding to the volatility of the subject and to Ed Norton's charisma.

654,KenE,Worst film of the year.,1,27 October 1998,"Yeah, it's stunning, all right -- in the way a cattleprod up the old wazoo is stunning. Alleged director Tony Kaye should be grateful to New Line for taking away this ad-hoc piece o' crud, which he admits he winged from a script he never even liked. (Gods of videotape and DVD, please spare us his cut, which he never completed, by the way.) From the very first frames, it's clear that Kaye has no rapport with his actors, and has zero idea how to get decent, let alone consistent, performances out of them. As the buffed-up skinhead leader, Norton tries hard, but he has three different personalities in the film, with the transitions between them either patently phony or (mostly) non-existent. A worthy subject, but this ""X""ecrable effort proves why some people are cut out to do 30-second commercials and not grandiose ""masterpieces"". In short, this guy makes Oliver Stone look the subtlest man on the planet. For all you message- seekers, here's the flick's big payoff: ""Hate is baggage"".

But please, please, please, see some more films, especially from Hollywood in the the '30s and '40s and Europe and Japan in the '50s and '60s, and then go back and give this thing another try. Norton gives it all he's got -- which is about three different performances, all against actors who aren't on his wavelength -- but the film is TERRIBLE on a craft level, full of overblown camera work, corny musical cues, and badly edited sequences. I'm not talking about the script, which even Kaye said he hated, or the content, which is volatile, but the movie as art unto itself. There is so much more that cinema can do, and this shockem-sockem item, designed for MTV addicts, is operating on a very low level -- even if that's where a lot of people respond to it.

This film was far greater than Saving Private Ryan as far as script goes and surpasses Shakespeare In Love in every category.  The cinematography was excellent and the acting superb.  The screenplay should have at least been nominated at the Oscars, but not even that was carried out by the academy.  I can't understand how a film like this would be so carelessly overlooked as the best movie of 1998.  I actually gave this film a ten, and I have only given three films a ten in my entire IMDB career (American History X, Godfather, and Star Wars Episode 1).  I have to say that this film was eye opening in more ways than two.  It taught me not to discriminate, not to hate, and most importantly not to trust the academy awards when I want to see a good film.

Word is Norton had final cut and it shows. The film adores him, but it's all too much. When Norton grimaces after slo-mo action sequence (action b pic 101), his eyes seem to say 'look into my face and see the horror!' I looked hard and found nothing. This film is playschool meets Nazis and it just does not gel. Interested in movies about skinheads, without conventional plot lines supported by cookie cutter players and timeworn twists? See Tim Roth in 'Made in Britain' and Russell Crowe in 'Romper Stomper.' No bs films that tell it like it is. Violent they may be, but violence can't be gratuitous when it is central to the plot. I wish I could say the same for American History x - i.e Norton giving his foe a pavement sandwich. This is Kaye, and/or New Line's way of saying 'we're not afraid to shock! We're true to the material!.' Sorry guys, tag on violence don't make it so.",American History X
658,bobafett-16,A great film,9,2 March 1999,American History X is a story about the effect of white supremacy. It stars the great actor Edward Norton as the Neo-Nazi who gets out of jail and finds his brother in the same group he was in.

It was overall a great film with great and mesmerizing performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.,American History X
659,PinnHed,A well-portrayed expose of hate. And remorse.,9,21 May 1999,"This is one of those movies that begs your average moviegoer to hate it. Hate it for violence, for racism, for brutality.  The truth is, this movie would do more to abrogate racism, brutality, and (maybe) violence if it were shown more widely.  Edward Norton proves he is not interested in being a pretty boy, but an actor.  Edward Furlong continues to remind us all he's more than that effeminate kid from T2.  For those of us old enough to remember the birth of skinheads, this movie portrayed their hateful, baseless stance head-on.  If you were ever thrown in a moshpit at a Suicidal Tendencies show, you know how you were kicked.  By the biggest group of losers in town.  Until they found Derek Vinyard and felt vindicated. However, this movie turns around and displays the other side.  The mindless quest to be a gangsta.  Without concern.  The only downside of this movie is the preachiness which was understandable but overblown.  The generational influences in this movie are brilliant.  From Dad, to brother, to little brother, hate begets hate.  An excellent movie, with balls that movies like ""Colors"" would have benefited from.",American History X

Very graphic, but the great graphics of it all make it more powerful and punch it home even more.And in my opinion, by far the highlight of this movie is the brilliant job of acting by Edward Norton. Norton is simply fantastic in this, as every other movie he has done. The scene where he kills one of two black car thiefs, the look on his face as he walks away from the dead body is enough to send chills up and down your spine. That one moment where you see that look on his face speaks more for his character hate and demented mind than any other scene in the movie.",American History X

I think that the message behind it is such a positive one too.  With the beginning black and white, and the end in color, Showing change.  You don't find many movies like this one these days.  To be about such a hard topic as racism and hate. One must see this movie to see meaning about what I am saying, and to understand the power.  From beginning to end, you won't mutter a word.

I can't describe the way i was feeling after seeing this, i was speechless, the only thing i could say to everybody was «My God, this movie is amazing!», i was shocked and stunned and touched and everything at the same time.It's amazing how a director like Tony Kaye and a writer like David McKenna made such an amazing movie in their debut in the movies scene. I found out this when, after seeing the movie, thought to myself «I have to see other things from this guys...» and, to my surprise, didn't find anything!One of the things that made me like this movie very, very much, was Edward Norton. He is, without any doubts, the best actor of his generation, and his role in this movie wasn't easy, but he made it perfectly. One of the strongest sequences of the movie is when Derek is being arrested, he is the personification of hate itself. There are two things that you should consider in Edward's acting (and they're both perfect), the first is his acting as a skinhead, he really makes us to think that he is in fact a skinhead; the second is his redemption, especially starting from when he is raped in jail, from that moment he begins is change into a different man.The other actors also have good performances, but we must be real, Edward Norton makes them small with his greatness.The end of the movie is also an amazing thing, and that's beginning to be something rare in these days, movies are starting to be predictable.Certainly one of the best movies of all times...10/10",American History X

This is the kind of film that is missing in the current film environment that is usually based more around flash than substance, ie special effects and a physically attractive cast are commonly used to win over audiences as opposed to a solid plot containing powerful messages that actually might make you think. I saw this movie last night and it is a fascinating insight into the insecurity of young people and their desire to belong to something, to feel accepted. I believe this theme is equally as prevalent as the denunciation of racism throughout the film. Another thing I liked is that the cast is portrayed as being incredibly human... nobody in this film is ""perfect"", as we frequently see in other films. From the protagonist to his young brother to the wise English teacher, they have all had their share of problems in the past, as well as in the present. I think it is a testament to the director and cast that we actually end the film sympathising with a convicted murderer. The moral of the film is that hate is baggage, and we reap what we sew in life. We need to ask ourselves that one question when our lives are veering off course ""Has anything I've done made my life better?"". For the protagonist in American History X, this simple advice is enough to turn around his life from that point on... but it is too late to undo the consequences of his wide-reaching influences, hurting him in the most painful place he ever could have imagined. So once again, this film is sheer power. Certainly it is disturbing in parts, and probably not for young children or the overly sensitive. Nevertheless, it is a fantastic film, truly one of the best of all time. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.",American History X
667,PeggyGoodwin,"Compelling, Honest Film",10,3 February 2007,"I am always surprised when such a compelling film stays under the radar screen, as American History X did. Yes, it was hard to watch because it was brutally honest about the issue of gangs, violence and racism, but it wasn't a sensational film where violence was added for the sake of violence.This film was groundbreaking and should be recommended -- possibly mandatory viewing for gangs and incarcerated gang kids.We can see by the new resurgence in gang violence that this problem is only escalating. The movie showed how an impressionable young man, Edward Norton, ended up seeking the gang life after losing the primary male role model in his life, his father. The gang leader of this Neo Nazi group replaced his father and instilled hate in him.Gangs give kids without personal power and belongingness a sense of both, and American History X showed how tragic the outcome of belonging to these gangs truly is.I love the fact that Norton has never shied away from roles that are controversial and complex; resulting in movies all Americans need to see.

After he is released from prison, he finds out that his brother, Danny Vineyard, is going down his same path.  Derek realizes that if wants to be at peace with himself, he must stop his brother from going down the road he went down.  The beauty of the film is captured in the last scene, when Danny shows that he has finally figured out what is important in life.

Finally a movie with an ending that isn't silly and predictable. Norton almost breaks through in this movie giving an all-star performance, we a great support cast including Edward Furlong. This movie will send you away thinking. The only lacking parts are some of the other cast members delivering stale obviously over-rehearsed lines at times like the first dinner table scene. Overall it gives presence to both sides of Racism and leaves you the feeling that neither side is justified. Norton learns not to hate, and that rage is bad. Then his brother is murdered by a black kid. It makes you wonder what exactly the director was trying to tell us. In the end, a 10/10 movie, all time favorite.

It's also the story of piecing back together a family that's been ripped apart by the poison of hate.Norton is charismatic, frightening and ultimately tragic as Derek. His performance dominates the film ,American History X is passionate and compelling, It holds together as a horrifying portrait of youth swept up by the finger-pointing and easy answers of Neo-Nazism.Here's a beautiful Quote from the Movie "" So I guess this is where I tell you what I learned - my conclusion, right? Well, my conclusion is: Hate is baggage. Life's too short to be ****** off all the time. It's just not worth it. Derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote. He says someone else has already said it best. So if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong. So I picked a guy I thought you'd like. 'We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. """,American History X
672,Dorrito79,One of my favourite movies EVER,10,6 July 2010,"I saw this movie about 10 years ago when it came out in the cinema. None of my friends wanted to see it so I went on my own and I remember sitting there when it ended, and thinking about what just happened. And it lasted for days. This movie is one of the very few that changed the way I think of cinema, cinematography and the role of music. Ed Norton plays Derek, the right hand of a nazi leader and Ed Furlong is his little brother, who follows him whatever he does. When Derek kills a black guy trying to steal his car, he goes to prison for 3 years and there he faces the fact that everything he believed in was built on lies and deception, and belief can be twisted for the sake of convenience. He comes out as a changed man and the movie is the story of the next 24 hours, what Derek does next, as well as flashbacks to the reasons why he became a racist. Edward Norton is as brilliant as it gets. This is one of his major roles in his career. He leaves a deep impression and his change for the role, putting on 30 pounds of muscle and shaving his head, is jaw-droppingly convincing, considering his slim build and intellectual aura. Furlong is as memorable as in Terminator 2 - even though he is a sidekick, he plays the disturbed and dependent little bro perfectly well. Thinking he is a rebel, he is eating every misplaced ideology that he is given, without ever freely making choices for himself. Some of the shots stay with the viewer a long time after standing up from the chair, and the music is dripping with emotion.

673,myrrth_sicopath,The 'X' is in reference to a perfect 10,10,28 October 2003,"American History X is the most provocative film ever made. It will make you think, it will make you cringe, it will make you cry. Dealing bravely with issues of supremacy and racism, American History X goes where few films ever attempt to go, and it does it perfectly.Edward Norton gives his strongest dramatic performance, playing a very believable, supremacist older brother reformed by experiences in prison. His character is one of the many in this movie that are brutally convincing and real. Edward Furlong plays an equally realistic, impressionable younger brother.If you can see past the swearing and violence, which is SUPPOSED to leave you feeling dirty, then you can see the real message of this fantastic film. I cannot stress enough how important this movie is to modern day America.A+",American History X
674,adam-blackley,I'm afraid I really did not enjoy this - and not for the reason you might think.,2,11 June 2005,"I'm afraid I really did not enjoy this - and not for the reason you might think (I wasn't disturbed by the racism or the violence portrayed by the film). I am afraid that contrary to the seemingly endless praise given to this film and its director, Tony Kaye, and indeed recommendations from my friend that I should see this film, when I did I felt cheated and annoyed. There's no denying that what the film portrays is shocking and powerful, and that Edward Norton's performance is equally powerful, almost coming close in intensity to De Niro's Bickle, and the set-pieces are well made, but the inability for the filmmakers' to create a convincing story spoilt the whole film for me - the way we see in endless flashbacks (often the sign of a weak storyteller), Norton's firstly ordinary, sane, likable character's seemingly easy conversion to a Nazi maniac just by his dad uttering a few racist sentences at the dinner table is frankly ridiculous. Plus his seemingly easy conversion back from a Nazi maniac while in prison, just through speaking to a nice black guy. I'm sorry, but it just negates the whole film's power. Not to mention the endless flashy camera techniques used by former ad director Kaye, NOTE: slow motion close ups of a running shower tap does not a good film make. The film opens on a black and white shot of the ocean, for no apparent reason, leading to the conclusion that Kaye thought he could appear as a 'clever' and 'sophisticated' filmmaker by showing us an 'arty' opening sequence. This kind of pretencion is as irritating as the lack of convincing back story. Nope, sorry Mr Kaye, wasn't for me.",American History X
675,isaacj-oconnor,unbelievably intense,10,31 October 2014,"I'm just going to put spoiler just to be safe because I hate it when anything is given away in movies..Watching this movie, it feels almost as if my mind has adapted another view. I mean some of the scenes like the curb-stomping are just ridiculous. After watching that my body sat still and I couldn't do anything except say holy s**t. By far this is the most intense movie i have ever seen. Events that occur are harsh and definitely drastic. The acting is unbelievable. Not a single bad actor in the cast, all very well done it almost feels as if they ARE the character in reality. Midway through the movie I thought about the bad part about this movie is VERY bad. And it isn't even the movie thats the problem, its the impact it would take affect on a viewer. Racism and I mean look at the kid who killed his girlfriend and cut her limbs into pieces. Where did he think of that? He LOVED the show Dexter and thats what Dexter does, cut bodies into pieces. I honestly could see that happening with this movie, someone symbolizing the first hour of this movie, up to when he grows hair. Despite that one piece, this movie is incredible. The way that Edward Norton does this character is truly incredible and he deserved that Oscar more than anyone else that year, well I guess Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan did pretty good too.This movie really shows the impact of the older brother and how much his younge brother is taking after him and how he is the one that can change him to being a better person and lose the racism. Last half of this movie is truly inspiration.",American History X
676,margaret_thanos,The Ending is Confusing,7,4 July 2021,"This film was most certainly ahead of the curb in 1998, but tbh I have huge problems with the way the film ended, almost as if it was justifying this cycle of violence and what happens to Danny's character at the end. I think it needed a lot more explanation, because any white supremacist watching the film would just think 'exactly, Danny gets killed so we should remain as we are' which is a dangerous thing for a film to do. However, Edward Norton was fantastic in this role and the film was very confronting. It's a solid 7 for me.",American History X

678,Movie_Buff_Brad,One of the best films about racism,10,16 July 2007,"One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them. The acting is great all around, and Edward Norton gives one of the best performances of all time. I can't believe he didn't win best actor. While I haven't seen Benji's performance, I doubt he was half as good as Norton. The film is also highly inspirational and moving. How is it that this wasn't even nominated for best picture, while Crash was AND won? Crazy.This should be shown in schools.",American History X

680,gavinalves,A Touching and Impactful Movie,10,26 April 2018,"While scrolling through IMDb, I stumbled across American History X. Intrigued by the plot summary, I decided to watch the movie with high expectations. Those high expectations were shattered with the incredible acting, heart wrenching, and soul churning scenes that unfold. This movie is extraordinary in every aspect. I enjoyed every aspect of the movie and would watch it again. The ending takes a stab into the viewers emotions, showing us the untimely death of our would-be protagonist. The scene only worsens when Derek rushes to the school and finds his younger brother lying dead in the urinal. The screams, shrieks, and cries from Derek nearly brought me to tears. The journey he had undergone, though revolutionary, was not enough to save his younger brother from the fate that was already sealed from following in his path of being a Neo-Nazi.The journey that is shown throughout the movie, switching from black and white to color, beautifully shows the outlook on life which Derek abides by, separating those who are not White Protestants from anyone else. The color change is extraordinary to convey his character transformation.The ending, as stated before, is one of the best scenes in the movie, pulling at the heart strings of the reader. Danny's fate is sealed once he blows the puff of smoke into the face of the African American student. This fate was carried out by Danny by worshiping the actions and ideology in which his older brother, Derek, dominated.The opening scene of the car robbery set the mood for the rest of the movie, not pulling back any punches when it came to brutality. The opening scene, however, also showed the contempt that Danny has for the final actions of Derek. Derek's murder of two African American men attempting to break into his car changed Danny forever. This change, however, is suppressed by Danny in order to be more like his brother. When Danny discovers the massive change in Derek, his frustration is let out by pushing him against a garage many times. This anger seems to be coming from the confusion Danny now faces on whether to follow his brother again or stick to what he made himself believe.All in all, this is an amazing movie and I would recommend this to any friend.",American History X
681,minx-pietz,"very emotional, very good",8,13 May 2006,"At the start of this film, I didn't know what to make of it. I found the music quite irritating, but I think thats just my opinion, I just prefer things to be less obvious , so I don't like too much music trying to explain situations for me, but once I had adjusted, I really did enjoy this film. Edward Norton gives a very good, believable performance, and the rest of the acting is also very good- there are moments when you can look into the actors' eyes and see the characters' madness, their fear, their sorrow, but don't be put off by this- it is morbid, but it isn't completely depressing. It makes some very good points and has some very strong scenes. The timing is also often perfect, with perfect reactions from the actors' which makes the chaos seem realistic. It's also not too predictable which is good, and the way it is set out allows it to be cleverly unravelledVery good, I recommend it.",American History X

683,MRP41082,Highly symbolic and relevant film,8,17 November 1999,"American History X adds dozens of symbols to a very controversial topic, and the result is a surprisingly good flick.

On the outside, his brother, played by the young Edward Furlong, is following the same tracks.Edward Norton is deserving of all of the credit and Oscar nominations he has received.  He is an amazing actor, unrivaled in his generation.  Anything starring Edward Norton is bound to be a very emotional and superbly acted film.American History X is filled with many very small symbols that help the transition of the story.

Ed Norton was completely amazing and Furlong was not far behind. Furlong has grown a lot as an actor and Norton continues to amaze me since the first time I saw him in Primal Fear.  The message here is an obvious one, but it is played out so well.  Some movies just entertain you, and others make you think as well.  American History X is certainly the ladder of the two.  The brutality of the film might be a little tough for some viewers to handle but, if you can get past it, it is well worth it.  Some of these scenes are the most powerful ones I have ever seen.  A definite must-see.  No regrets here baby. 10 out of 10.",American History X

I saw the movie unprepared, since it was shown at a sneak-preview, so I had no idea what to expect. But it had me at the edge of my seat in no time.The major roles are very convincing, and the settings are truly believable. Sometimes a little too realistic. I must say that during some of the Neo-Nazi moments, the props made my blood run cold.However, I'm sorry that there's such a high age-setting. In my view a movie like this one should be shown in all schools all over the world... and the people who should see this are the same impressionable youths the movie rating wants to protect. I'd rather see that they see what hatred can lead to before they're swept away by some racist megalomaniac with smooth words.",American History X

The ending was so sad that I could never sit down and watch that part.  I thought Edward Norton did an outstanding job, I see why he was nominated for Best Actor.

A Masterpiece you'll never forget. excellent.",American History X
691,trickynicky72,Waiting for Kaye's counter-punch...,7,23 September 1999,"For a film that was clearly intended to be a jolting social commentary about the serious state of racial tension in contemporary America, I found it to be oddly lacking in any real dramatic `kick'. To be sure, it does have all the elements that should have added up to a classic tale of an `American Tragedy'---skinheads, guns, betrayal, and the final price of redemption---but somehow the end result seems all too neat and clear-cut (`black-and-white,' if you will) to be totally convincing.The acting, as advertised, was very, very good. Edward Norton did a fine job of rendering a believable (despite the shortcomings of the script) portrait of a troubled, yet bright and sensitive young man, and does deserve all the credit he has received. Having said that, I must say that it was the other Edward who really gave me a pleasant surprise. Furlong's role as Danny is by no means as showy as Norton's, but his performance was every bit as impressive. By bringing a rich mixture of quiet intensity and genuine sense of innocence to the role, Furlong has made Danny into someone very `real', someone you would actually care for---the sweet boy next door who's going through a rough, confusing period.Stacy Keach is one veteran who is always dependable, and in this film, he is chilling, dangerous, and oddly hilarious all at once. Good show for him! In fact, I liked everyone's performance with the exception of one: Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. I do acknowledge the fact that he's supposed to be the strict-but-fair `guardian angel', and must therefore carry a certain measure of `weight of authority' in playing this role, but boy, there is such a thing called `overdoing it'. Frankly, he looked so stiff and uncomfortable that I began to suspect that maybe his suit was too heavily starched. It's a shame because Brooks is actually a good actor who hasn't been too lucky in getting meaningful roles such as this one.All in all, the film is a solid one, the superb acting compensating for the lack of depth in terms of story development. It is a well-known fact that director Tony Kaye tried to get his name off the whole project due to `creative differences'. I have no way of telling, but I vaguely suspect that he was aiming for a direction that would have been more in line with what I had expected to see in this film. It would be interesting if he decides to tell his version by releasing a `director's cut' at some point.",American History X
692,Gordovox,Disappointed,7,2 October 1999,"I have to say that for all the hype I heard before seeing this movie, I was greatly disappointed in it. Although Edward Furlong, and Edward Norton play strong roles in this film, there was just something missing in the story to explain the sudden life affirming changes in Norton's character. I don't buy that his little bit of jail time could change his apparently strong hatred and negative emotions to his rival race. There just wasn't enough character involvement, or educational development in his character to believe that he could make such a wise decision. We are led to believe that he is a very smart, and charismatic leader, in forming and running his own ""white supremecy"" group, yet it all comes to a grinding realization when he spends some time in jail with a few black people, and sees how his own ""supremist"" group deals on an even keel with all of the other races in prison. I think this movie had so much more to offer, and started off on the right track, but just went flying along on that track too fast, and missed out on some issues that should have been dealt with on the characters level. I give it a 5 out of 10...but could have been easily an 8 or 9 if only character development wasn't rushed along so fast.",American History X
693,gdlange,WOW!!,10,8 October 2001,"I hadn't seen this movie until just recently but my brother has liked it since it came out.  ""Liked"" probably  isn't the best word.  This movie was absolutely horrific.  I was sobbing throughout most of it because of how much it disturbed me.  This movie is most definitely not for younger kids, I'm 18 and that might be a little young.  The movie was wonderfully done and Ed Norton did a great job.  Derek reminded me a lot of my brother, not the racist part of him, but just some of his mannerisms.  A must see movie to help bring to light some of the horrors of todays world.",American History X
694,Leigh-43,Truly amazing.,10,4 October 2000,"When I sat down to see this film I was apprehensive because I had heard that it was very violent and that's not usually my sort of thing. I decided to watch it though as it had been given such good reviews and I already knew what a fantastic actor Edward Norton was. This film is one that I think makes and impact whether you love it or hate it. I thought it was terrific and Norton's oscar nomination for his role as modern day Nazi Derek Vinyard was truly deserved. This film tells the story of how Derek came to reform while spending time in prison for the murders of two black men who were trying to steal his car. Derek, just released, realises that his younger brother Danny is headed down the same path and tries to stop him before he gets into trouble. Edward Furlong also gives a good performance as impressionable Danny. Well worth watching.",American History X
695,arthur-58,Unbelievable,5,26 October 2000,"I think a lot more could have been done with this movie.  The scenes were very realistic and really got the audience to experience what was happening. Edward Norton is brilliant as he moves from one segment of his life to another.  The use of b&w and colour was effective, albeit not very original.My major disappointment is the total unrealistic change of heart of the Vinyard brothers.  In a matter of four months (from the rape to the parole), Norton's character goes from full-blown Neo-Nazi racist to mild-mannered boy next door.  The same goes for the ""daddy breakfast"" scene.  Norton goes from one opinion to a totally contradictory opinion in a matter of minutes. How are we supposed to believe this?Maybe the story should have been played out over a longer period of time and the events swaying the characters opinions more dramatic.",American History X

It is truly Edward Norton's greatest performance and not only that, but one of the best performances of all time by anyone. All the other performances in the film are great too, but none compare to Norton.The story's portrayal of past and present is marked by the past being filmed in black and white, and the present filmed in color. This is a very effective tool and adds tremendously to the films power.The script portrays some of the richest dialogue in film history. Many of the best moments are when Norton is first becoming a white supremacist.AHX is powerful because of the intensity of several of its scenes.

This movie shows even the most fanatical person has this capability to change his or her beliefs. As a general rule stories, no matter books or movies or whatever, must be included that changing of its character for instance in changing in personality, change the way the character behave, changing in thoughts and many other things. The important thing is this change must be logical and fortunately in this film Derek change to another person logically. And after that Derek was worried about his brother when he realized that his brother has this tendency to follow his footsteps but they change their problems with talking. In addition shots in black and white and colorful pictures was a wisely action. In the end, what a great and shocking ending!

The language is a bit rough but it adds to what we have to imagine is their regular way of life. The Actors- Best acting I've seen in awhile, I had my doubts about Edward Furlong but he pulled it off perfectly and Edward Norton pleases as usual. Direction/Camera work- The direction is great but with camera I have one complaint at some spots it was too close but other than that brilliant. Also, the end will reduce many people to tears.

703,hrstar24,Brilliant.,10,8 July 2009,"There is definitely a bunch of controversy surrounding American History X, and not just because of the racial theme. Director Tony Kaye tried and failed to get his name pulled from the movie, because Edward Norton supposedly changed a lot of scenes in the movie and had final cut. The truth about how much Norton changed will probably never be revealed, but it doesn't matter. Whoever wants credit, Kaye or Norton, made an incredibly layered and brilliant film.American History X shows the fall of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a bright and persuasive young man, into the blame and hate of neo-Nazi skinhead gangs. After a few years in prison, Derek has seen the error in his ways and he tries to cut his ties with his former gang, keep his family safe, and he must keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from walking down the same path of anger.As soon as the film began, I was drawn in and taken for an emotional roller-coaster. It is an intricate weave of family, brotherhood, redemption, and anger all stitched together with racism and culture. Maybe it's because I have an older brother, but the relationship between Derek and Danny is incredibly realistic and touching. Derek is Danny's hero, just like my older brother was my hero growing up, which makes it hard to watch as Danny follows in his brothers footsteps of hatred. The damage of Derek's involvement with the neo-Nazi on his family is also documented very well throughout the movie, and it makes you wonder when is it to late for redemption and what happens when your past sins finally catch up with you? Edward Norton is an incredible actor, and he gives his absolute best performance here. It is chilling just how convincing he is when he justifies his racism. The entire supporting cast does a great job as well, especially Ethan Suplee who plays a fat, stupid, and incredibly racist skinhead. This film is cut and put together extremely well, highlighted by great shots of Venice Beach and slow motion capturing all the emotions felt by the characters. This is all topped off by an incredible score composed of a great orchestra and choir.It is almost impossible to find anything negative about this movie. Maybe a couple of lines from small characters like a prison guard aren't delivered too well, but that's about it. This film is perfection. It is so incredibly emotional from beginning to end, and is just put together so well, that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I don't say that a lot. I highly recommend American History X to anyone and everyone. This is one of the only times I have ever given out a perfect score for a movie.10/10",American History X

I had to actually pause the movie in order to watch the robbery scene, you know the one, the the guy laying on his stomach with his mouth open on the edge of the curb. Still bothers me.

The genre of this film is meant to be uber realism and this was not a likely path to redemption. Sorry if this was enough for you.There was no where near enough build up of hate between the younger kids which resulted in a high school slaying.The warmth between the prisoners on laundry duty was a missed opportunity, nothing of substance passed between the 2 of them to merit the benevolence. The score was great and the graphic violence was done very well, triggering raw emotions. Finally, affirmative action is mocked by many good people, politicians and social commentators all around the world without a racist bone in their body.

706,ahmet-erik0,Very Strong and amazing Film,10,7 August 2015,"I was expecting a kind of a moralistic movie with an overly present, almost preaching like message. The movie however turned out to be extremely powerful mainly due to the professionalism it was made with.The movie its story is told 'beautifuly' in black & white and color. The quite original directing from Tony Kaye gives the movie a nice visual style and certain atmosphere. The story itself isn't that complicated or extremely original on its own and perhaps at most points even predictable but the way the story is told is phenomenal. This is not a movie with an happy ending or a movie that provides a solution to the racial discrimination problems. It shows what is NOT the solution to the problems and that everything that is occurring is like a vicious circle. The movie does not give a hopeful message but instead shows the dangers and pain you're causing to yourself and your close environment when you're thinking as a white supremacist.As an anti Neo-Nazi movie this movie works really powerful. I think that its a really good and important thing that this movie is often shown in classrooms.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Also surprising good was the musical score by Anne Dudley who had already won an Oscar for ""The Full Monty"", the year before.This was a movie that surprisingly impressed me.

The research that writer made for this film is amazing ..! You just have concentrate in few dialogues that was like Out of the world !! Screenplay very well scripted and such a wonderful use of Slow motion shots !! As a whole The best from Tony Kaye and David McKenna !! I don't like drama kind of films but American History X wont disappoint you .....!! I actually TOO Impressed with Edward Norton ........!! He makes his way to ma all time favourites <3,American History X
708,DFG1916,Overrated,6,5 March 2006,"I'm truly stunned at the rave reviews this one has received. It's well acted, and contains some powerful scenes, but there is a huge, central flaw in it: Derek's conversions are simply not believable. One dinnertime conversation with his father sets him down the road from intelligent, easygoing bookworm to belligerent tattooed Nazi skinhead? This just wasn't credible. His conversion FROM fascism, while much more thoroughly explored, is also unconvincing - he just seems to have abandoned his (ostensibly deeply held) convictions all too easily and completely. And frankly I saw the ending coming a mile away! The film seems to have been made with the idea of shell-shocking viewers by its scenes of extreme hatred, and judging by the other user comments here it clearly succeeded in that. But strip that away and there just isn't much to it.",American History X
709,kimjoh,amazingly good,10,1 May 2005,"What more can i say about this film that already isn't said?... nothing. I just have to join in on the praise of this film. The story is so well told and bang up to date concerning racism and fascism. The acting is generally very good, but Ed Norton steal the show with he's amazingly believable performance. The story is told through the eyes of Dereks(Norton)little brother Danny(Furlong)It deals with racism in todays America and the frightening consequence's and historical misconceptions young men and women gets exposed to in a neo fascist environment. The hate and the belief that the white race is Superior overshadows all reason and logic. Without giving away too much of the plot i can only say that the consequences of Dereks way of life will have a deep impact for he's future and the future of he's family. An amazing film. If you still haven't seen it, get a copy today.",American History X

Such a hard subject to deal with in cinema yet so wonderfully portrayed.Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are the perfect acting duo for this role, you wouldn't expect Norton to fit so naturally into it, but he does, and nobody could have done a better job.This film has so much; tension, disgust, anger, love, comradery, hope, despair, tragedy....

713,baraktsafrir,A great meaningful film,10,5 April 2020,"May I just start by saying, that this film is one of the best I have ever seen. The cinematography is incredible and the acting is just perfect. The main idea of it is ""Hate is baggage. Life's too short to be pissed off all the time. It's just not worth it."" meaning that there are no people who are born bad or good, it's your actions that define as a person. But if you hate you just waste time that you can love and support.The film is not easy to watch and I still recommend it to everyone who wants to hear about it and that want to watch a fantastic film.",American History X
714,Petey79,Very Disturbing View into American Racism,9,13 November 1998,"This was an incredible movie that should get Edward Norton the recognition he well deserves, as well as an Oscar.  The cinematography was stunning, as well as most of the acting.  In particular Edward Furlong was very good in his role as the younger brother who just wants to please his brother.  You cannot watch this movie without being deeply disturbed at the very least. There was one scene in particular that I do not think that I will ever forget.  An instant classic.",American History X
715,Mr. Devo,best film of 1998,10,13 November 1998,"An amazing depiction of a racist skinhead's transformation to a non-racist after a jail sentence. Edward Norton is brilliant, the direction is strong, and for once, it's a fairly accurate portrayal of skins (the racist ones, anyway). Thankfully, it avoids the silly stereotypes that previous skinhead films like Romper Stomper and Skinheads: The second coming of Hate resorted to and I'd say this is unquestionably the best film of 1998. Everything about this film was right on. My brother and I left the theater speechless and in awe.",American History X
716,Nigel-16,The most powerful movie I've seen in a while,10,25 May 1999,"Ed Norton is an incredible actor.  I've seen five movies with him, and he's played a dramatically different role in each of them.  And EVERY one of them has blown me away. This time he plays a convincing skin-head neo-nazi, as well as a convincing ex-neo-nazi, trying to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. Every minute of this movie kept my complete attention (and believe me, I have a short span of it).",American History X
717,Dusty-28,Impressive,10,10 June 1999,"American History X slaps you in the face, as you see that Derek Vinyard, the guy that you saw horribly killing a black man, makes a pretty good point at the dining table, discussing immigration politics with his mum's Jewish friend. Unlike the characters, things aren't black or white in this movie. Which is good. It made an enormous impression on me, and Edward Norton is really unbelievable (especially when you remember him playing Aaron Stampler in Primal Fear!).",American History X
718,manwich,one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen,9,10 May 1999,"American History X is not a movie for the weak.  If you can't stand racism, hate, or anal rape, then maybe you have no business watching it.  However, everyone in America SHOULD watch it. It's the story of Derek, a young man who just happens to be the leader of a local neo nazi group.  After killing two black men who were breaking into his truck, he is sent to jail for three years.  During his stay behind bars, a series of events forces him to change his view of life. Upon getting out of jail, he finds that his younger brother is following in his hateful footsteps.  Derek must then attemp to convince his sibling the error of his ways before it's too late. This movie gives the viewer a chillingly realistic look at how bitter and ultimately sad life can be when hate consumes the soul.  One of the best movies of 1998, second only to The Thin Red Line.  Definately check it out.",American History X
719,Spuds007,Even a black girl can like it!,10,19 June 2001,"Never before have I felt so moved by a movie before.  People thought I was crazy to want to see a movie about a white supremacist because I'm black, but by the end of the movie, I was in a daze.  The opening and ending segments were enough to make me run to Circuit City tomorrow to buy this movie.  Edward Norton's diesel build naked didn't hurt too much either. This movie and Requiem for a Dream are two movies that will leave you thinking ""what did I just witness"" and you'll be thinking about it for days",American History X
720,msobhan,riveting,9,10 October 1999,"The very good film about prejudice and its effects on people. It has a rather scary portrayal of the Neo-Nazi culture. Although Derek's transition from a hard core Nazi to a tolerance preaching older brother is shown  too quickly (almost as if a violent rape was enough to create disillusionment), the transition from the son of a working class father to a brutal Neo-Nazi killer is given more attention. Some of the premise is a bit unbelievable. Overall it is an excellent drama.",American History X
721,joe7,"Silly piece of ""racism 101"" junk.",3,3 November 1999,"This is a truly insulting movie. They must assume the average American audience is a bunch of half-wits, and they can put on the screen every stereotypical idea about where racism comes from (""oooh, you see that? You learn it from your parents!"") You can make up any story you want for the screen. (""Oooh, look at that! The white guys betrayed and raped him in prison and the black guy told the other black guys to leave him alone! Now he'll see why he was wrong to be racist!"") Hopefully the American public isn't stupid enough to let such movie-makers talk down to us.         Skip this piece of junk and see ""A Raison In the Sun"" or ""Gentleman's Agreement"" if you want a film that at least engages the logic (or non-logic) of racism in an intelligent fashion.",American History X
722,neilpollock,Just another buddy film,5,26 January 2001,"I was expecting an intelligent analysis of the sociology of racism amongst urban whites in the USA.  I thought that I would gain new insight into the mind set of extremists.But I got a whole load of standard liberal Hollywood hocum, wrapped in the familiar buddy scenario.  With the exception of our brilliant and dangerous hero (played by Edward Norton) and his little brother, the neo-nazis are just a bunch of ugly simpletons.  Their shadowy leader, Cam,  played by Stacey Keach is .. ho hum.. another one dimensional figure of total nastiness.  Dr Evil without a sense of humour.In total contrast there is the black Mr Novak on the 90's - Dr Sweeney from the local high school.  The nicest, wisest, most one dimensional guy you could every meet - and perhaps the most boring.  Avery Brooks acts so badly in this roll I hope I never see him on screen again.And Elliot Gould is resurrected for some reason as a Jewish love interest that the film just didn't need. Yikes!Of course, the protagonist's white extremist friends betray him in jail and he is beguiled, and later protected, by a charming young black guy who makes him laugh.Funny that a film about racism succeeds in making everything black and white.  We all know that truth is dominated by shades of grey. But unfortunately it's difficult to make a good story out of the greys.The message is - hating is a waste of time because it doesn't make your life any better.  Yes, it's that deep.It think this flick would have sunk at the box office if it wasn't for the tremendous screen presence of Edward Norton.If you liked this you probably will like Colors, Higher Learning and Falling Down.  All dismal attempts to provide context and understanding of American racism.I don't think that Hollywood has added understanding since The Ox-Bow Incident (in the 40s), Bad Day At Black Rock (in the 50s) and In The Heat of The Night (in the 60's).",American History X

He plays such a different character here than he does in Fight Club, his other most notable performance, but he is still completely believable throughout. Indeed, here he plays 3 different characters - the confused kid, the racist hooligan and the redeemed hero. The film shows how racism can split a family apart and the devastating affects of enstilling racism into young people. A fine film.

It's a chilling experience. The performance of Norton is mind-blowing. As a damaged young man, he makes the transition from passionate racist to remorseful man without many words a real and feasible act. But I honestly don't understand why some viewers focus so much on the effect that the behaviour of the eldest son has on his family. Doesn't his hate reach much further than 'just' one family?

728,dopeydave98,A thought provoking film with a masterful leading performance,10,17 October 2002,"When the nominations were announced for the 1998 Oscars I wasn't surprised that Edward Norton had been nominated again. He had lost out in 1996 for his performance in Primal Fear, although I felt at the time the nomination was more of a recognition for a combination of his work which included The People vs Larry Flynt and Everyone Says I love You.The thing that bothered me was the film... American History X. Why had I not heard of it, let alone seen it. Unsurprisingly it had got a very limited distribution in the UK, I guess because of it's content. I waited for the video release and I was not disappointed...!?!Many people have lauded Norton's performance and rightly so. As a demonstration of his range it is masterful. A physical transformation akin to De Niro in Raging Bull, together with an emotional performance that takes in extreme violence, intellectual reasoning, regret, remorse and fear.But there is more to this film than Norton's performance. Avery Brooks' understated Dr Sweeney allows those around him to bring out the emotion of the piece. Stacey Keach's Godfather-like quiet menace is his best role in years. Much must be said too for Tony Kaye's directing, the starkness of the black & white flashbacks works superbly on several levels. It demonstrates how Derek's reasoning was as black & white as the images on screen, together with the sheer bleakness of the life he was leading; out of date film for out of date attitudes.Much has been said of the subject matter and the violence; the subject matter simply cannot be approached without reference to the violence, unfortunately that is the world we live in. David McKenna's script does not pick sides, but skillfully tells it's story without prejudice. Derek is a victim of circumstances, he's avenging the injustice of his father's death, falling under the spell of Alexander, leading the struggle on the streets against the politicians who haven't got a clue what's happening in the real world. Dereks journey from a bright schoolkid to a violent criminal seems so straightforward. Yet the real struggle is the journey back.My one moan would be that we didn't get the opportunity to see more of Derek dealing with life after prison. Norton's portrayal of 'violent' Derek is the lasting image I had of the film, simply because the performance was so good. It's fair to say had he had the chance to explore 'reformed' Derek, Norton with his range would have done a fine job and the film may well have been more widely accepted.All in all a brave film that demonstrates the actors craft perfectly. One of those word of mouth films, like Shawshank, that will be talked about for many years.",American History X

731,strangla35,Wow... just... wow.,10,3 August 2006,"If you decide to watch this movie, be prepared to be struck to the very core of your soul. Very few movies I have seen manage to dig so deep into my heart as this one has, and I am a critical, skeptical, analytical kind of guy---I am about the furthest thing there is from a sappy, ready-to-cry-at-any-time moviegoer!Set in Los Angeles, the story of the movie is that Derek Vineyard (Edward Norton) is sent to prison after a double murder that is motivated by racial hatred. During his three year stay, he undergoes changes and realizes the error of his ways, only to find out that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path that Derek once was. After getting out on parole, Derek is determined to make sure that Danny does not wind up making the same mistakes as him.Although the movie jumps back and forth from the present (shot in color) to the past (shot in black and white), it is not confusing in the least.This movie grinds and twists your emotions like very few other movies can, because it pulls absolutely no punches as it exposes you to some of the darkest facets of human beings. You'll gasp, you'll cringe and you may even cry as the movie demonstrates to you how warped and vicious human beings can become when they are consumed by anger and hatred---and ultimately, the destruction and horrible endings that that anger and hatred leads to if we cling to them long enough. One last thing---the acting in this movie was phenomenal. Every actor did an astounding job with their character, but I have to mention how off the scales Edward Norton's acting was in this movie. I mean, he has NEVER failed to impress me, but wow... to see him go from a man who is so filled with such high octane rage and hatred, to a man who is consumed by remorse and sorrow as he at last realizes his mistakes, to a much more soft-spoken, reasonable man who is filled with compassion and concern for his younger brother, and at last to a man who is torn apart by agony and grief as he fully realizes what his mistakes have truly cost him... and to play all of it flawlessly... well, I just can't say enough how good of a performance he gave. To see the true consequences of one man's hate, and at the same time, seeing that one man's hate tear apart his family---it's something that is not easily forgotten. This movie teaches why, as Edward Furlong's character puts it, ""hate is baggage"".",American History X

I would highly recommend this film to others.",American History X
734,Rebul21,A gripping performance from Norton leads American History X to glory.,10,8 July 2020,"American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi and his overcoming of hate, and his attempts to prevent his brother from following in his footsteps. The film shows how blame only leads to hate, and hate creates nothing positive, only suffering and regret.
Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard, the former neo-Nazi, is enthralling and showcases his exceptional ability. Norton bosses every scene he is in, whether he is portraying a neo-Nazi or one that has overcome that path; it almost seems as if he is portraying two different characters. Some extremely powerful speeches - whether for good or bad causes - are excellently written, showcasing the ability of screenwriter, David McKenna, and Norton delivers them exceptionally.
Supporting performances from many of the cast, including Edward Furlong, who plays younger brother Danny, are well done. Danny in many ways portrays the shadow of his older brother; he is on a very similar path, and this is clearly shown when comparing the Derek seen as a neo-Nazi in clever flashbacks to Danny now, and the gap in mentality and attitude there is between the brothers after Derek is released from prison. We get a more precise view of Danny's thoughts in small sections we see in his essay, American History X; he writes the words 'It doesn't bother me anymore' on his computer screen, and this in some ways explains his demise and how he has been desensitised to violence and hate.
The use of different characters to represent levels of extremes and how people influence one another is profound. The headteacher of Danny's school, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), is the first person in the film we see try to discourage Danny from falling into a hateful path, he represents a sort of hope that one can be better than full of views of hatred and division. The new partner of the brother's mother, Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), represents how people with decent views can be pushed aside by hatred. And characters on the other end of the spectrum, such as the brother's friend, Seth (Ethan Suplee), who embodies blind thuggery. How these characters influence both Derek and Danny show how important it is to listen to the right people and is also a showcase of the intelligent writing on show.
Director Tony Kaye utilises every minute of this film to full effect; no scene is wasted. The film has a good pacing and is done very well with flashbacks and current events. The cinematography is quite brilliant, the use of the noir effect on all flashback scenes is crucial. The black/white contrast is a theme ever-present in this film and the noir effect captures this perfectly. The fact that present scenes are in colour also shows a contrast and change in attitude of Derek; as in the flashback scenes he is a neo-Nazi skinhead, full of hate, and in present scenes he is a changed man, a neo-Nazi no more, and a man who has lost his hate.
The film shares some similarities with Shawshank Redemption: they both involve crime and prisons, but more importantly can give the viewer a slightly different outlook on life. Shawshank has been known to give many viewers a different outlook on life in general - how to view life and how to be more positive. American History X can give a viewer a slightly more nuanced look on life; it shows how hate gets you nowhere, it only causes evil, and that losing that hate can make your outlook on life much more positive.
American History X has a cleverly intertwined story that is still relevant today. Edward Norton's performance is outstanding along with the screenplay, and although the main character may not be relatable on face-value, the way his mind works, is manipulated, and the mental experiences he goes through can be compared with those of an everyday person. This makes for a captivating experience and is well worth the watch.",American History X

739,amblin53,Different Meaning,10,9 December 2007,"I've read many of the comments for American History and have understood people's opinions for this movie. But I am not sure if they understood the whole meaning of the movie.The movie is narrated by Danny Vinyard, a teenager who's brother Derek is head of a white supremacy group. During the movie you find out why everything for the Vinyard family goes downhill because of a tragedy that happens. But, what I think people are missing is what Danny goes through. Danny and Derek are kind of like teenager figures who are lost in today's over abundant society. Danny is trying to get his brother's appreciation because Derek is kind of a father figure, since their father's death. So when Derek started becoming a white supremacist Danny became one too. Lost in anger, Derek becomes very serious about gathering frustrated white kids to help him get back at others. Not to sure of himself Danny goes with the flow. Later on, Derek is released from prison as a new person, after he was sentenced for three years for killing two gangsters that were trying to steal his car. When Derek notices that Danny wants to be a criminal like how he was, he tries to convince Danny that all of the criminal acts Derek did were bull. Danny and Derek both have their own struggles.The reason why I say Danny and Derek are teenager figures is because during one's youth we experience suffering, peer pressure, anger, love, and life itself to become the person that we are. I myself could say that because people just like you the reader and me go through that everyday. I hope whoever reads this finds it useful. But remember, this article is just my opinion and thoughts about American History X. I respect anyone else's opinion, if they hated it or liked it. I just want to get a point out.",American History X
740,A_Memory_Forgotten,Love Hatred,8,27 September 2007,"Hated and ignorance is brought out in this film between people, but then there is the friendship between people also. Overall, this movie is about a love within another. Someone who cares about someone deeply, it's about a man who realizes that some legacies must come to an end.After a brutal assault from a black man who had came to get his revenge from a past event. Derek Vinyard, looked up to in a Neo-Nazi group is sent to jail for 3-years. Now his brother, not having a father to look up to (He was killed by a black man several years ago.) for the past few years must only act the way his brother had. Danny Vinyard acts hatred toward different races, and tries to follows his brothers foot steps. This 15 year old teen is very gifted in academic skills, but tends to throw it all away for the Neo-Nazi and intends to be a leader like his brother.Throughout Derek's experience of 3-years in jail. He realizes so many things. Now, he tries his best to stop his brother from becoming what he was once was.The acting in this film was phenomenal by Edward Norton. He is a very good actor and can bring out his character so well. 10/10 For the acting by him, for the whole movie it's just 8/10. This movie is worth seeing completely, for it is a great film of passion and love. Then, there is straight up hatred.

741,tomscammell,Irksome and Predictable Socialist Rant,1,14 July 2008,"This film had been highly recommended to me as a 'must-see' by a friend of mine as it was apparently so thought-provoking and powerful.The only thing that this film provoked in me was anger and disappointment - not with the subject matter, but with the film makers, and this type of film in general.If this film had been put before us in a realistic and more balanced, politically-unbiased way, then it would have perhaps got its message across much more effectively.In terms of realism - virtually every character in the film is a ridiculous stereotype. The funniest example of non-realism has to be the black v white basketball match could not have been depicted any less realistically if they had tried.The scene: A group of skinheads (who as far as we know have never played the game before) challenge the blacks (who seem to spend the majority of their lives playing the game) to a gentlemanly basketball challenge, whereby whoever loses has to immediately vacate the premises and never come back. Of course the skinheads narrowly win, and the losers politely vacate the area without so much as an ""M.F."" being uttered.Yeah right...The overall impression I got from this film was that it was just another crude anti-white, anti-democratic, socialist rant-fest along the lines of other similar films (Romper Stomper etc), and the message it puts across is this: If you are a white man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes black people, then you are a brainwashed, monumentally unintelligent loser who is incapable of reasoning or making any judgements for yourself. You idolise an insane 1930's Austrian dictator and there is a high probability that you are a homosexual rapist.If you are a black man who prefers the company of his own kind and dislikes white people, then that is totally acceptable and cool. If you want to be obnoxious and confrontational to the white folks, and go around shooting them through the head for no good reason, that is understandable because they are all probably horrid racists and deserve it.This film should be burned along with the small-minded chumps that made it.",American History X

743,FrannyBeanz,Nothing Short of a Masterpiece,10,17 August 2010,"It would be an insult to call this a ""movie"". It is a MASTERPIECE. I first saw this in my senior year of high school, and I literally sat in stunned silence well into the end credits. By the time this film is finished, you've been taken on an emotional roller-coaster and you feel like you've been punched in the gut. I know I did. Edward Norton turns in another amazing performance as the reformed skin-head who tries to prevent his younger brother from following in his footsteps. It's the story of how Derek (Norton) goes to prison for killing 2 black guys who he catches trying to break into his car. His younger brother, Danny (Furlong) witnesses the whole thing. Prison changes Derek's perspective on life dramatically, and upon his release from jail, finds out that Danny is coming dangerously close to mimicking Derek's dangerous neo-nazi ways. In order to explain to a confused Danny why he is so different now, he tells him about his horrible and traumatizing experience in jail, which we are shown through flashbacks. Some people argue that the ending was predictable... call me naive, but I did NOT see it coming, and I was left, literally, with my jaw on the floor.

It was an accurate depiction of racist behaviors and a lot of thought went into it. It was well made, especially the black and white scenes where the climax was. It was rather harsh though. I could see many people getting offended, and I really woulden't blame them. Edward norton and Eddie furlong give great preformances as do the other actors and actresses. Everything about this movie was well planned. It was extremely intresting. I think if more people watched this film, there would be less racisim.",American History X
745,KnightMove,"Powerful anti-racist movie, spoiling itself in a racist finish",2,2 June 2004,"SPOILERS!I don't know why so few people seem to realize it, but AHX is a self-contradicting, self-spoiling movie. In an intelligent way, it deals with racial problems and racism, condemning the latter. The main character, Derek, becomes a Nazi as his father is murdered by blacks, but has to realize to have made the wrong decision. This can be regarded as the message transported by the movie... till the finish, when the little brother of the main character is murdered by an ""evil nigger"" schoolmate for basically no reason. So in the end, this movie is confirming anti-black prejudice and doesn't make sense after all. It's even dangerous brainwashing. If even an anti-racist movie is racist, well, this attitude must be the right one...",American History X
746,amichiganwolverine,the best,10,19 June 2003,"This is my favorite movie by far.  I remember watching it for the first time, disgusted when derek uses his powerful dialogue to provoke the other neo-nazis, and getting that feeling of helplessness after the ending scene. No other movie has left emotions scarred into me like this one. I know it is only a movie, but it really makes one think of what kind of society we are living in today, and the prejudice some people are forced to face.  While Primal Fear is the movie that exhibited Edward Norton's potential, this is the movie that proved that Edward Norton is the best actor today.  Very powerful. 10/10.",American History X
747,gingerkris,Intelligent Drama,9,28 September 2004,"Strong performances by Edward Norton & Edward Furlong really make this  film for me. The direction by Tony Kaye with his mixture of black &  white history contrasting with colourful reality is magic to absorb and  shows this film up to be what it is  a true American Classic,  ironically by a British director.  The film itself is about two brothers, Derek the elder and Danny the  younger adoring sibling. Derek has been in jail for three years after  killing a black youth who tried to rob the family; the nature &  brutality of the crime still shocks me to this day.   AHX tracks Derek's history through the first formation of racist  sentiment laid down by the father. These feeling of hate are  embedded when later his father is killed in the line of duty. Derek  becomes involved in the local Nazi movement, his intellect turned by  youthful rage into hate crimes and the rational that comes with Neo  Nazi propaganda.   The Nazi-tattoo sporting, egotistical, philosophical younger Derek is a  steam train waiting to crash, his propulsion to stardom is eventually  embodied when he takes the life of the young thief, the scene is very  apt as he calmly lies down and knows he will be a hero to his friends.  Without wanting to spoil the film Derek encounters change in the  prison, he meets a black man whom he works with and faces his own  demons inside, I will leave it there for those who want to be moved by  his transformation. Anyway, he comes out a new man and only wants to be  that new person, which means leaving the old crowd, leaving the  Anti-Jewish sepal he's been living with so long. The problem lies with  his brother who has become a little Derek, getting drunk and being  influenced like he was. Derek's cross to bear is that he can't change  his life without his brother coming with him and being on the right  side of humanity.  I think that this film is less about race and more about our ability to  change as individuals, the fact that we can become what and who we want  is a gift. Derek becomes the man he always wanted to be, he only wants  the same for his brother.   Kaye's use of black & white creates an atmospheric drama that builds  tension and has you feeling like a stung out piece of drum leather by  mid movie. I love the way that Kaye subtly uses quotes and  intellectualises the Nazi Stance, only to watch it being broken down by  the same man (Derek / Norton).  Norton is a joy to watch as is Gould and Furlong.   To sum up American History X is a powerful intelligent drama, which  provides plenty of discussion after the movie. This film should be on  every high school curriculum",American History X
748,Youngman_Grand,"Weak, shambles, facile moralising.",1,15 November 2010,"Making a movie about racism is a very easy way to tap into an audiences pre-existing righteous anger without the need to really explore the subject, treat it with respect or develop any kind of understanding around it. AHX knows this, so advances a paper thin plot with any number of ludicrous clichés, cardboard characters and dopy narrative devices. Edward Norton is no longer the Universes least convincing skinhead (stand up, Elijah Wood), but this movie stretches credibility way past breaking point.The movie doesn't actually try to analyse racism on the more subtle, insidious way in which it exists in most peoples lives. Sure, there are neo-nazi and black power groups around, but this isn't most people's experience of racist behaviour. Only at the end of the movie do we get any hint this, when we see Dereks father discussing his pejudices over the dinner table. But this is very fleeting and it doesn't really give adequate justification for why Derek decided to go down this road in the first place. The movie should have spent far more time looking responsibly at the root causes of such peoples actions and ideologies - but that isn't as easy or as sensationalist as portraying all racists as maniacal cult-heads or separationists. The presence of characters like Stacy Keach's Manson-esquire demagogue serves the questionable purpose of allowing audience members to distance themselves entirely from these kinds of beleifs. Most people I think struggle to some degree with inherited prejudices as a result of ethnicity, class, geography, economic status etc, but films like this pander to our solipsistic view of ourselves as utterly non-judgemental by suggesting that racism only occurs amongst the lunatic fringe.Additionally Tony Kaye more or less disowned the finished product, claiming that Edward Norton used his star clout to have the film re-edited so that it was more to his liking. The main point of contention seems to have been that Kaye felt the film should have had 'an adequate black voice'. I'm not quite sure what was exactly meant by 'adequate', but I can totally agree that the films narrow scope shifts sympathy onto the white protagonists in a confusing and dubious way. Because almost all of the black characters are so unlikeable, aggressive and one dimensional, with no context to explain their actions, and because one of them ends the film by murdering Furlongs character (a child) for pretty much no discernible reason, it's hard not to feel like we are expected to empathise with Derek and possibly feel like his original agenda was justified. AS well as this, when a 'liberal' character like Murray is portrayed as an ineffectual, idealistic fool, you begin to wonder why the film is so intent on making a violent, near-psychopathic skinhead into some kind of marginalised voice of reason.Films that attempt to tackle the race issue in modern society will always fail to deliver as long as they are content to sit back and simply push buttons in order to generate a calculated response. The overwhelming majority of people in society know racism is a bad thing, but most ignore how endemic it is. Pinning it all on some gun totin' extremist hooligans, then not even being able to properly decide who you are sympathising with is not the mark of accomplished, mature filmmaking.",American History X
749,goyamjain-212-381704,Masterclass Melodrama,9,30 March 2016,"American History X is a mad frenzy wrapped in beautiful apparatus of direction, cinematography and screenplay. Although it showcases plethora of emotions, it does so in an unapologetic manner. Movie delivers a powerful and concise message and it all hits you well. Movie scores much less on symbolism and subtlety. But, it scores an 'A' in delivering what it wanted to, in a very direct fashion. It deals with morals, conditions, reasons and consequences of an ideology and gives precise conclusion. It scratches layers subject like racism and makes you dwell deep into all related aspects. Now to story telling and drama, movie does go overboard but keeping in mind the delivery of message, it was highly essential. Journey does get wonderfully erratic. A work on understanding psyche of community and its strong ties are well highlighted but scratch underneath, and you find dark hollowness. Protagonist found just that, as we take a journey with him and his family. Movie is well shot. Close angles captured emotions perfectly, to the point it makes us feel as if we ourselves are encountering situations and questions on subject. All actors do a fantastic job, nothing much on it. It could have been better written or perhaps meanings could have been hidden. Like portraying a step away from such ideology was shown in fully melodramatic manner of removing all posters from room. Overall, its a movie that engrosses you, takes you to uncomfortable zones, puts you into situation many a times, and delivers a particular message that hatred induces such actions and thoughts, and anything based on hatred at its core can bring no good to you.",American History X

I like how they portrayed Norton as a white supremacist. Not as a redneck but as a normal guy whose life is changed by a dramatic event, which leads him to join a skinhead group and later challenges his beliefs. Although the movie is brutal and very graphic, It goes along with the plot unlike some slasher movie just about gore. There is a reason to the violence and it shows during the course of the movie.

A comment made by Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny (Edward Furlong) Vinyard's father changed the family for life. A common story of a little brother following in a big brothers footsteps, with a twist. The older brother (Derek Vinyard) is a ""purist"". Wanting to eliminate minorities and totally against drugs. Anything that could ""infect"" the white race. Derek commits hate crimes and is sent to jail. While in jail for 3 years, his younger brother is confronted about writing a book report on Mein Kampf, saying that Hitler was a great civil rights leader. The principal of the school, Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) confronts Danny about his report telling him it was completely unacceptable. Dr. Bob Sweeney decides to school Danny in his own way, taking him out of his regular class and into a one-on-one environment. The class is called American History X. Danny is instructed to write a story about his older brother, being the god of a white power gang. Danny confronts Jerome (Jonathan Fowler Jr.)(an African-American) in the bathroom after Jerome jumps a white boy who cant stand up for himself and is scared.

Sure, it's a nice story  with a very clear and unavoidable message  but it did not really disturb me. I like a film to disturb me, to make me doubt my opinions. And I can get disturbed by strange and obsessive people, not by a single swastika now and then. In this movie everything was so obvious, clear cut and outspoken: the dialogs seemed to be taken from high school plays: our thesis on racism'. The filming was smooth, there even were some background violins if I'm not mistaken. But there was nothing raw, nothing hidden, nothing seductive, nothing strangely energetic in this piece. The whole story got told'. And I really disliked the black&white of the flashbacks, that did not add anything worthwhile. Conclusion: Of coarse' I can agree with the message  but the filming was a little cheap. I'm curious about the movie Tony Kaye wanted to make.",American History X
755,Acorn-2,"A provocative, intelligent, well-made film",9,13 November 1998,"It is always easy to poke holes in the the efforts of others. The more sincere and earnest those efforts are, the easier cynical critics find it to denigrate them.Nothing succeeds entirely and AHX certainly has a number of (minor) weaknesses that others have pointed out - primarily problems with the script. But where it fails it mostly fails because it tries to do something very difficult.
There is a sincere attempt here to add a thoughtful and provocative comment to the important dialogue on bigotry and hate that is essential to human survival in an increasingly inter-racial, intercultural world. That Kaye and McKenna choose to end with a truism: ""hate is baggage"" - is not a cop-out, but a painful truth - hate is in us and only by dealing with our own hate can we deal with that around us.What is perceived as Norton's ""vanity"" is completely in keeping with the character - stemming from the same insecurity as his need to control and his racist self-aggrandisement. What else is the swastika tattoo, for instance, but a piece of vanity: primitive body-jewelry? His performance is daring, frightening and compelling if one is able to drop the defenses of cynicism and be moved by it. Ditto Edward Furlong's work.This is one of the best realised films by a first-time director and first-time screenwriter I can ever remember. Although imperfect, it is damn good. Even to have gotten such a difficult, non-""feel-good"" film to the screen is an enormous labor.

756,Michael-100,Well meaning but poorly made,4,14 April 1999,"There's been a lot to do about nothing when it comes to this film. While watching it I was struck by the preachy nature of the film. Like I was watching an old high school film about racism and hate. The film is extremely cliched and, at times, simply formulaic with a stapled on ending which tries to add an ironic nature to the film but only ends up causing the film to suffer from the old Hollywood adage of ""serious films have sad endings"".The most blatant example of the poor story telling is when Derek is in prison and he realizes that black people simply aren't evil. The way in which this comes about is scriptwriting at it's worst. There was much to do about the directing but the film is filled, once again, with poor work. Kaye was said to have done his own camera work on cinematography. It's obvious that professionals should have been used. The only saving grace is Nortons fine acting which is lost among the many flaws of the film. Better films about racism and hate have been made. Skip this one.",American History X
757,Dave-291,An excellent film -- compelling and profound,10,5 November 1998,"I'd go so far as to say that it is one of the best films that I've ever seen in my life.  The reason I'm not afraid to make this statement is because I'm not judging it based on the technical aspects, but on the impact that it makes on the audience.In all of my movie-going life, I've never been in a theatre where not one person spoke throughout the entire film -- until now.  Even when the film ended and the credits were slated to roll, the theatre remained completely silent as everyone simply stared at the screen in either awe or shock.The range of emotions that this film hits is astounding.  Some of the most brutal imagery you'll ever see on film is captured in ""American History X"", imagery that will make you cringe.  But  at the same time, the character of Lamont (played excellently by Guy Torrey) will have you cracking up in laughter.  Edward Norton is fantastic as Derek Vinyard, illiciting from the audience feelings from hatred to sympathy, and even making the character likable in the end.This film should win best picture, but it won't.  The subject matter is too grim for the Academy to bestow that honour upon it, even though the film is as deeply affecting as it is.  It simply steps on too many toes.  But Edward Norton should and probably will win best actor, because out of this somewhat dismal year for film, he simply shines in this performance.",American History X

Edward Norton's performance in Primal Fear was spellbinding and his performance in this film was equally captivating.  Then add in Edward Furlong's performance and you have a film that is worth the price of admission.  But it goes way beyond mere entertainment.  It makes a statement about our society, sort of like a punch in the mouth...The script is excellent, the film's genre is superb, the acting is the best I've seen this year.  I hope the Academy will consider these factors and award the artists who collaborated to make this film, rather than shy away from the controversy.A final note.

760,c-dub,A film that elicits more questions than answers.,7,29 May 1999,"Any time you go in to make a massive moral statement in a film, much as in an essay, you should be able to back up your argument with equal or greater strength. A lot has already been said about why racism is bad-great movies have been made showing the idiocy of it-and yet it still persists. I'm worried that this film might actually do more harm than good. I thought the skin heads were very well portrayed to the point that their line of thinking could be agreed with by young people who are looking for an answer to there problems. The problem is, the counter points were mainly shown in violent cinematic splendor. The type of stuff we have become conditioned to see with a disclaimer going off in our head saying ""it's only a movie"".I kept waiting for a moment to pop up when our hero(?) would come through with a truly compelling reason to show his change of heart, but it didn't happen for me. The homosexual prison sequence is the kind of stuff people (who this film was meant to reach) might find funny. And the death at the end bit has been done so many times; it has become convenient to simply off a principle player as a solution.I felt it was coming close when we were shown how Derek was made to realize that it would take more than a change of heart on his part to make things right; he would have to address his past actions to make things right.Then the movie ended.Now one could argue that the death of his brother would have a greater impact than anything else they could have shown, but, as said earlier, it's been done so many times that it seemed like more of a cop-out.There can be no arguing that Ed Norton was brilliant. Maybe his performance was too good. The look in his eyes after he'd killed the man with his foot was chilling. I saw this look of pride and accomplishment on his face that made me wonder if some young and impressionable sort watching this movie might get the idea that it might be cool to do similar. And that scared me more than anything the movie could have shown.It's easy to counter this argument with the statement ""It's only a movie"", but this was a ""message movie"" and I feel there is more danger in the right people getting the wrong message.",American History X
761,Bijuno,Human. Nothing else.,9,7 September 1999,"My first glance at the movie were those black and white trailers.Now I see, those contrasts usefully display the difference between races on the flashbacks.  But them, at the same time, present the characters as one, and only one type of black and white human.  And that is the word.  Human. Nothing else. The excellent performance by Edward Norton gives us a view of what those divisions in the human soul makes of us.  The treatment of a very delicate theme such as racism is very well handled here.  Nobody wins.  Only hate and rage, justified poorly by us, are the winners. This movie isn´t about Derek (Edward Norton), it is about Danny ( Edward Furlong).  His point of view of what life is to him...and how it changes. The scenes were shocking. That is reality.  The cinematography is great ( water flowing from the shower).  The realism of the story purely convinces us.  Nothing is left aside, my thoughts were still flowing like for about thirty minutes after the film was over.  I was sitting still, looking at the screen, thinking "" Oh my God, this is what we do, this is how we do it, and this is absolutely human!""...Human race is pretty dumb, we like to dislike ourselves.",American History X

763,aeronaut,Why did it take so long for me to see this film?,10,4 April 2001,"Last night I sat down and watched American History X for the first time. I'm not sure why I didn't take notice of this the first time around, maybe it was the subject matter, or maybe it was the cast, i'm not sure but for some reason it eluded me.After my copy of Snatch refused to play in my DVD player I decided to put on American History X and settle down for a nice quiet night in front of the television.  What unfolded in front of my eyes was the most powerful and gripping film that I have seen in recent years.  From the first minute right through to the last I was on the edge of my seat.  So what makes this film so right?  In a film so completely brilliant it is difficult to pick out one thing, but the cast and script complement each other in such a way that it is impossible to pick any holes in the film.  Norton puts in the performance of his life with Furlong providing the commentary as the film diarises the rise and fall of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his influences on his younger brother.  In a film with such strong leading performances it is easy for the supporting cast to get lost in the headlights, but this is the amazing part, each supporting role (from what looks like a reunion of the Star Trek actors guild) is as strong and influential as the main ones. Avery Brooks plays the strong but subtle school principle and Beverley D'Angelo and Jennifer Lien play the Vinyard mother and sister respectively and they all turn in a real star performance.The best thing about this film is that it doesn't preach, it doesn't moralise and it doesn't hold back.  At all times the audience is left to make their own judgements on the story and the characters and anyone with a soupcon of intelligence will be able to make their own mind up about the films message.Since seeing this film last night I have to say it certainly ranks in my top 5 all time movies and it's a potential number one.

In this film, Norton plays a skin head who goes to Prison for brutally murdering two black men who are attempting to steal his car and comes out reformed only to find that his brother (Edward Furlong, turning in a fine performance) is headed right down that same route.Yes, the ""hate is bad"" message is overplayed and by the end of the film you've been hit over the head with it. The scenes, as well as the story, are minimal and the ""shocking ending"" is predictable, but it all doesn't matter. It's all more of an actor's piece than any one else's and Edward Norton turns in the  most amazing performance I have ever seen captured on film. No longer, the sweet innocent psychopath he was in Primal Fear, Norton bulked up considerably for this role and it pays off.It is, hands down, the most powerful American film in decades.

It deals intelligently with a wide range of issues affecting society and the individual.  Racism being the most obvious, but also the need to take responsibility for our actions and do whatever is in our power to improve the world.  If this sounds trite, don't worry, the film avoids sentimentality well (mainly due to the fine performances) and shows that the weapons that change the world are suffering and love.  It is not afraid to raise questions that it leaves the viewer to answer, which can be frustrating, but ultimately more worthwhile.  Somehow it also manages to be highly entertaining, with a rich vein of humour running through it. Director Tony Kaye shows his advertising roots too much but that can be forgiven.  Not a perfect film, but certainly one that shows that cinema can deal with far more than car chases, bad sex and fart jokes.",American History X

When Vinyard finds out that there are three black men outside trying to break into his car, he finds his gun and runs outside killing two of the three men.

Upon Derek's release from prison he is shocked and disappointed when he finds his brother in the group.American History X is an excellent film based on the story of a racist man and his family.  I have never seen Edward Norton in a role like this.  It is fantastic!  He does an excellent job at portraying his character.  The film starts in black and white, a flashback.  The film then progresses to color, the present, and flips back and forth between the two.  The flashback sequences are done really well, and placed at appropriate spots.  The directing of this film was also done really well.  American History X surfaces racial issues and does a great job at portraying their reality. When the movie was finished I didn't feel too happy, but that was not the film's purpose.  Kaye did a fantastic job at pushing through the emotion that he wanted the viewers to get.

Not only is his physical transformation incredible, but he plays this character in several different stages and is 100 percent believable in all of them. He's truly one of the greatest actors working today, and this is one of his top performances. The film itself also does an excellent job of showing Norton's character, Vinyard, as much more than one-dimensional.

A huge emphasis in the movie is given to the influence an older brother has on his younger kin, Tony Kaye shows how even the seemingly most horrid acts such as murder can be seen in a good light by a person who looks up to the person committing them. Overall the movie is relatively disturbing in the beginning, but by the end of the first hour and then towards the end the movie starts to resemble a coming of age movie. The main character represents maturity and conscience when he leaves prison and that contrasts well with his younger brother who if not stopped, is heading down the same path his brother was.",American History X

I actually found it hard for my brain to switch off when I went to bed afterwards, as it made such an impact I couldn't stop thinking about it.All of the black and white flashback scenes are completely captivating and are perfectly balanced with the present day story. The neo-nazi beliefs that the Vinyard brothers share are not just simply portrayed - they are explored in such a way that we discover seeds and roots and how the two characters have sunk to having such ideologies.The writers, along with Edward Norton and his incredible portrayal of Derek, the eldest brother, did a remarkable job of making you truly believe that the characters were capable of redemption, something they started building on early on, which carried the film the whole way through.Every character no matter how small provided interesting roles and thought provoking interactions and every single scene felt integral to the story.
This is such an emotional, enjoyable and harrowing watch and I think everyone should see this!!",American History X

776,andreadave-81699,Powerful and thought provoking,10,15 January 2021,"A movie that drives home the fact that anger , hatred and tunnel vision can destroy not just one but several lives. In this movie Derek was so full of hatred and rage that he acted onthese feelings , destroying not just his but his mothers sisters and brothers lives, and also the lives of his victims families and loved ones luckily there was a chance at redemption, although a life was lost it changed the path in time for Derek to save his younger brother from heading down the same path ! The fact that Derek was incarcerated and had his life saved in jail by someone of the race that he was so full of hatred against made him open his eyes and reasses his views, it made him a much better person and he learnt a few very valuable lessons which I think quite alot of people could learn from, anger and hatred are NOT the way to solve problems, our world would be a much better place if people actually stopped to think about how damaging acting on these feelings could be. Not everybody has to have the same views, but learning to just agree to disagree could be a huge step in maybe helping to stop a majority of the hatred in people, YES, we'll still have people walking around that are committing crimes ....and yes, people will probably feel like vigilantism is warranted....but at what cost ?
This is a brilliant movie that actually drives home the fact that any type of act carried out in a fit of anger will most likely be at the detriment of ..not the offender...but the person seeking revenge.",American History X

He doesn't cry because it's a love story, or because it's an utter tragedy, he cries because he sees the world for a moment and perhaps for the rest of his life through different eyes after watching this movie. I didn't even want to watch this movie because of the title. At first I thought a movie with an 'X', hhmm it might be about some twisted tale about Malcom X or people like him (ie. Nation of Islam before he left them). Then I read its about Neo-Nazis, and I felt like its now a racist movie on the other side of the spectrum. Either way I decided, watch it, learn what is really out there, no matter how much you may disagree with it. That was one of the best decisions I ever made.Not only is this movie based on a true story, but it makes us question ourselves. Are what we believe to be right and wrong so clear? Where do we draw the line? Where is it written that being white or black should automatically makes us enemies? This movie is deep. I fell in love with the cast, all of them, black and white, but most notably the main character 'Derek' and his little brother. Those two are an inspiration and all of us need to take examples from them.Whatever it takes, everyone in America, no, everyone in the World should see this movie. Absolutely Superb!",American History X
778,bobarinobobalucci,Good but not destined to be a classic,1,7 September 2004,"I'm a bit bewildered by the praise heaped upon this film. Ed Norton does a good job and was just coming into his own at this point. His acting was not at the level it is today though. Furlong earned his money but did not shine in his role. Balk utterly failed to rise on this cinematic occasion and Keach showed up for the check. The story, the underlying message and personal transformation of Norton's character should be considered the pillars of this film. I however staunchly disagree with its position at number 61 in the top 250 films. Ponder for a moment that Spartacus is over 100 films below American History X, that alone should give you pause. It would be accurate to say that votes from the younger, more internet savvy, could be held accountable for such an imbalance. Those who felt that Eminem deserved an Oscar for 8 Mile. In both instances the story had a degree of truth and realism but Oscars are for a chosen few. I urge generation x and generation next to take more than a mere cursory look at the fellow top 250.

Not only is it a film that inspired me to become a movie ""nerd"", it is a story that has helped shape portions of my attitude towards life. The message of ""Hate is Baggage,"" is something that I think about quite often, and for me, is as a result of watching this movie. The message is legitimized by Derek's story, and the insight the movie provides into the maturity of his psyche. It's simply amazing how the movie show's how easy it is to let little thoughts of hatred you're your brain, and how those thoughts can grow into actions with the help of influential people. ""Is anything you've done, made your life better?"" is a powerful question that the movie asks not just Derek, but everyone watching as well. Only a film as good as American History X could pull this question off. The movie creates a character that the audience puts so much emotional baggage into, that they (or at least me) are surprised that their answer is ""no."" In a way, the movie almost makes you believe that Derek's racism is justified, and then smack's you in the face by making you realize how wrong you are. On top of the incredible story, the movie is technically superb. The black and white flashbacks make watching the story easy for anyone. Edward Norton's performance is one that ranks with the best of all time, and the music works well with the emotional response of the audience. 10 out of 10!",American History X

At first, I wasn't very sure of it, because the plot didn't really seem to interest me.  Luckily, I sat down one night and started to watch it.  It was one of the most powerful movies I had ever seen in my life.  Edward Norton's performance of Derek Vinyard was one of the best I have ever seen, and Edward Furlong, not to be overlooked, gave an extremely touching performance as Danny, the younger brother desperately trying to fill his brothers footsteps, no matter what the consequences.

The direction is excellent and it was a great choice to film Derek's past in black and white, which is highly symbolic of his racial views of the world at that time of his life.  The direction is highly expressionistic with slow motion and extreme close-ups used extensively throughout.The Australian film ""Romper Stomper"" should be billed as a ""double feature"" of sorts with this film.  That film follows a group of neo-nazi skinheads around Melbourne and shows the racial hatred directed towards the asian population in the city.  Whilst it deals on resolving issues & conflict within the skinhead group itself as opposed to resolving their racial weakness, it gives a great representation of the Australian struggle with racism the same way American History X does for the USA.American History X - 9 out of 10, only because the ending was a tad predictable and the change in Derek's character could have been explained a bit better.",American History X
782,admiralpiett,The most powerful movie you will ever see,10,15 March 2002,"A while back, my roommate and myself decided to see a movie with a mutual friend of ours; as we couldn't come up with an idea by ourselves that sounded interesting (Clerks and L.A. Confidential came up, but we had both seen those), we asked our friend if she could bring a movie that none of us had seen but that was supposed to be well-made.  Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over.  It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night. American History X follows the story of a young, brilliant, and very charismatic leader (stunningly played by Edward Norton) of a gang of Neo-Nazis in California, as well as his younger brother's (played by Edward Furlong) involvement in the same group.  I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating.  Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it!  To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of ""Racism is the ultimate evil""; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion.  Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white.  Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of.  What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct.  Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them.  Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from.  Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed.  Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R: horrific violence.  What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting.  It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again.",American History X
783,wayupnorth,"flawed execution, but Norton is amazing",7,11 October 2002,"By now you probably know the basic plot, so I won't recount it.  The problem is that the overall message of the film - racism is malignant and doesn't provide the solace it promises - is completely undermined by Norton's presentation.  He gives a truly stunning performance, but his character (Danny) is so much more appealing when he's the mesmerizing racist poster boy.  When he returns from prison, after having sorted out all of his prior racist ideology, he's much less interesting to watch.  It was actually disturbing to me how sexy he was, shirtless in the street, after having just killed someone in one of the most violent ways I've ever encountered. It's hard to buy the idea that racism is bad when it comes in such an attractive package, especially when its opposite is presented as feminized and weak.This movie had high ambitions, and almost reached them, but in the end misses its target by letting Norton be TOO good.",American History X

I have been a fan of Edward Norton for a while now, yet only recently decided to pick this up as it was very(!) cheap. I never thought Norton could deliver a better performance than the one in Fight Club, but oh how mistaken I was. American History X is the most powerful, moving 1 hour and 50 minutes I have ever experienced. This drama chronicles the life and beliefs of Derek(Norton) and Daniel(Furlong) Vinyard (told through an essay which Daniel was required to write for his black teacher Mr Sweeney, Avery Brooks), who are members of a white supremacist group. After many years hard time in prison, Derek's views are drastically changed and he tries to convince his brother that the Neo Nazi way of life is wrong.Deeply touching and saddening at times, American History X is a very dark drama and not for the feint of heart, but one that needs to be experienced by everyone.

785,ryanbye7,The flagship of movies about racism!,10,20 January 2012,"American History X is a film that reminds me that movies can be about something important. Whether its a lesson that we as humankind come away from by the end about treating everyone equally and with respect. In my estimation this film should have won multiple Oscars. I understand why it didn't though. This is a film that shocks you with brutal, and I mean brutal truth. Edward Norton did score an Oscar nomination(HE SHOULD HAVE WON) for playing a vicious Venice Beach skinhead through certain actions ends up in prison and then becomes reformed for his bad deeds. It is so rare that you see an actor completely disappear into a character. For a while you forget that you are watching a movie and just experiencing life on screen. Every nuance that Norton brings to the table is like watching a cascade of fireworks ripping across the sky. Its up there with DeNiro's performance in Raging Bull. (Yes folks he is that good). There are scenes of such intensity with violent words or physical beatings that many people will be unable to look at the screen. Obviously the curbing scene. American History X is a story about family, redemption and of course the legacy of hate. Hate blinds us from its ripple effects and the damage that it causes to so many people. The only other film that comes close to these social issues is Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. But I think American History X is a better film because there is an ending in this film that just shatters your heart. I first saw this film at 19 and I am 32 now. I keep having different experiences because of my own experiences with racism and hatred. This is a film that sets the bar so high I don't think a film like this from a major studio comes around this often. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie it will change your life, for the better!",American History X
786,Musicfreakkatie,A chilling modern-day depiction of Nazis and racism,8,19 January 2003,"*May Contain Spoilers*I first saw this film three years ago when I was 14.  My friend suggested it to me; she said it had a moving plot and would have an amazing effect on me. She did warn me that it was quite violent (especially the rape scene), but that I should nevertheless still view it for its powerful message.  I took her advice and rented it.Now I know what you're thinking: ""How could a 14 year old understand this movie?  How could they get anything out of it?""  Believe me, I was a very mature 14 year old (not that I'm not mature now, at 17), and I understood this movie's message perfectly.The plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a former Nazi who was jailed for murdering a black man.  While in jail, he slowly befriends another black man and begins to see the error of his ways. (Let me remind you that this doesn't happen overnight; it is a ""gradual"" process).  Once he is released from jail, he is determined to keep his younger brother from following the same path he did.Meanwhile, Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) gets in trouble for writing a book report on ""Mein Kamph"" (did I spell that right?).  Rather than suspension or expulsion, the teacher tells him to write a report about his brother Derek's life.On a side note: You have to feel sort of sorry for Danny; he is a confused boy that looked up to his brother and is trying to follow in his footsteps. I'm not saying what he's doing is right; I'm simply stating that one should feel sympathy for him; he really doesn't know what he's doing to himself.I haven't seen any other films with Norton in them, but I doubt that they could match his excellent performance in this movie.  The hatred he emitted was so real; you really would think he actually hated blacks and minorities. Furlong was also great as Danny, though at some parts, I thought he wasn't really into his character (but maybe that's just me).Now some people may compare this film to ""Schindler's List.""  DON'T DO THAT. ""Schindler's List"" was a cinematic masterpiece; very few films on this particular topic match the depth, detail, and emotion conveyed in that movie.  ""American History X"" is not meant to be compared to ""Schindler's List.""  Think about Shakespeare's play, ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Now think of the movie based on the play (the one with Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie was decent, made you laugh and cry, but could never match the tragedy and romance that the original play had.  It's purpose was to entertain and give a message.  Treat ""American History X"" the same way.Overall, a powerful, chilling film, right up to the horrifying conclusion. It DID have an effect on me, and it is not a movie I will soon forget.8/10",American History X

Conceptual direction, writing, and directing are all superb, with effective and original use of black-and-white filming to rival that of Raging Bull. Cinematography was excellent, along with sound. Emotional build up ingeniously misdirected, to add for a real shocker. This is what a real depiction of deep familial turmoil and affection looks like, along with blind racism and prison life. Emotional themes are blind hatred, family love (especially brotherly), rebellion, with underlying tones of atonement, and a hint of depression.

It bought up a lot of issues and explored them in depth. There were references to the Rodney King incident, various historical studies and more involved. Another thing about this film was the sheer intensity and violence. That image of Edward Norton's character pavement-stomping the African-American man who was breaking into his house and then him lifting his arms before the police revealing the swastika tattoo on his chest, that remains etched into many people's memories as a rather classical film moment. The whole make-up of white nationalist culture is probed here as Derek Vinyard (excellently portrayed by Edward Norton) attempts to escape from the neo-nazi gang he was once the second-in-command of and prevent his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) going down the same path. There is one other performance that stands out and that is Stacy Keach's menacing portrayal of white nationalist mentor, Cameron Alexander.

Keep that one little question in your mind because it's the basis of this entire film. Look, everyone looks at skinheads, kkk members, and other miscellaneous hate organizations as mindless hateful machines. We give them no credit, we say there is no basis for their beliefs. Which isn't necessarily true, a lot of it has to do with how these people chose to act upon these feelings. That's what this film focuses upon it gives you more. More to work with, more to work off of, and that's what makes this film more than ""good"". This guy, hateful as he is, is human, with family with heart, and beliefs, and inner demons and choice and we see that. All of it. We start to understand him, we start to see little bits of ourselves in him (we may not want to admit it but we do) we start to watch him and analyze him. This ""guy"" is Derek, yeah, he has a name and this movie it chronicles his past and present. It goes from, intelligent to brainwashed to hateful to prison to changed (mind you, he never loses the intelligence, it just becomes masked by hate). Amazingly dynamic transformations. Yet, he has to watch his brother, Danny, go down the same dingy self-corruptive path. This is what the movie focuses on, and as you watch you grit your teeth and you soak it all up. Because you know in reality, everyone's a little bit racist. Everyone is ""capeable"" of attaining such a status. David McKenna wrote this magnificently, and Tony Kaye captured his writings with great artistic vision and skill. He didn't overplay it, he didn't water it down... much ;) He captured this film and delivered it with such amazing power and grace. Along with an absolutely brilliant cast Edward Norton as Derek and Edward Furlong as Danny, not to mention the small but powerful roles played by Beverly D'Angelo (their mother-Doris) and Avery Brooks playing the ""I won't give up on you"" history teacher Dr. Sweeny. This film is powerful, by all means. It does more than any over the top Oliver Stone flick, because it truly captures the essence and the moment. Because that's what it's all about. Right? Before we judge them we need to understand them, and change accordingly, and fight like mad to hold on to the things we treasure and consider dear. Remember that. If i told you more than the basics (which i kinda did) the movie, in my opinion, wouldn't be as much. All I can say is; I'd definitely recommend it, artistically, as well as content wise.

Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts.Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers. This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt.

What I loved most about this film is that no matter what your beliefs are when it comes to race and politics, it makes you think deeply about the beliefs opposing yours. I'm not saying that it made me consider neo nazism, but Derek's speech before the attack on the grocery store has valid points on the subject of Americans on welfare. But enough of the politics. This movie makes me wish that Edward Furlong would've continued to do great movies like this instead of playing cameos in less than impressive Seth Rogen/super hero movies. The character of Derek is actually based on a real person and his evolution out of the white supremacist idealism and the film truly sheds light on (sadly) a case in America these days.

After Derek left the prison, he understood that his life attitude was wrong, and trying to change his brother's attitude before it is too late.

Also it shows you that there will always be people out there that will not listen to you no matter what you say or do. I personally think that this movie tells you that you should try to reach as many people as you can and to not compromise your views to try and reach someone that won't listen to you, that's there choice and there the ones that are going to have to deal with it not you.

798,timmyfish,An unsettling in-depth look at the struggle between reason and frustration,9,31 January 2005,"Racial issues are not black and white- but enough with the cheap shots. What I think separates this movie from others of its kind is(apart from its awesome style and the performance of the cast) its tone towards racism. Instead of portraying the skinheads as idiots or demons, people that are beyond reason and understanding, it shows why anyone would become a skinhead. The answer is: for roughly the same reasons one would join a gang. Namely, affirming your dignity and identity by hating everybody else. When people start to hate entire races, they aren't thinking about a causal relation between criminal tendencies and skin pigmentation. Or about the metaphysically controversial notion that entire groups may somehow be responsible for the actions of individual members. They're not asking themselves whether ""groups"" as such actually even exist. In short, they aren't thinking logically: they're using perverted inductive logic to project their frustrations onto people they don't identify with. They treat these people as scapegoats. A coping strategy, as frightening as it is obscure. A phenomenon that seems to recur throughout human history, each time adapting itself to the spirit of the times. In this movie, Edward Norton en Edward Furlong both convincingly play bright but frustrated skinheads. They allow the viewer to understand the horrifying appeal that the racist rhetoric might have. And I found myself provoked to re-evaluate my own opinion on the matter. Affirmative action, racial profiling: what am I to make of these things? What would I do if I would encounter racial violence? Violence in general? How do we stop it? For once, this question, as well as the movie, is an honest one. I don't even know if it's possible. But it's going to take guts. that's for sure. So did this movie.",American History X
799,bkautzman,Perhaps the most powerful film of the 20th Century.,10,11 April 2006,"I won't recommend this movie to the faint at heart. I won't recommend it to anyone who is easily swayed by propaganda. I will, however, recommend this move to anyone who is open minded enough to understand that the material portrayed in this movie is real.Perhaps the most disturbing part about this movie is the fact that the actions and events contained within are the actions and events in every day America. Filled with powerful imagery and outstanding acting, American History X conveys emotion so vivid and so powerful, the meek will have a hard time stomaching it.Norton's character is so powerful, he could sway even the most devote civil right's leaders with his rhetoric. That is what makes modern day leaders in this regard so scary. When a person such as Norton can spew forth such crap with such conviction, he is a person to be feared. I do not know of another actor who could portray Derek Vinyard as effectively as Norton did.While Furlong's performance isn't quite as convincing as Norton's, he does portray a corrupted innocence that made me actually care for him. By then end of the movie, I felt like he was my little brother.This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever watched. It gets a perfect 10 on a 10 scale, and I'm pretty conservative when handing out 10's. This one goes on my top 10 list of ""all time greats"".",American History X
800,Sam_Moriarty,Brilliant Eye-Opener,9,15 May 2006,"Every now and then one of those films comes along and just blows you away. American History X is one of those films.Set in Venice Beach, in the Neo-Nazi skinhead neighbourhood of LA. You have two brothers Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) whose father was killed putting out a fire in a black neighbourhood. Their father's death estranged them into believing everyone none white-protestant is scum. One night after winning a game of basketball, two blacks try to steal Derek's car in the middle of the night, Danny hears and tells his brother, who is the right out there with a gun in his hand. Where he kills one of them, and performs one of the most disturbing deaths in cinematic history to the other. Derek is put away to prison for three years, where he meets Lamont (Guy Torry, who gives an excellent performance) a black laundry worker who gives him a speech that makes him see that his beliefs were wrong. He returns from prison a changed man, but isn't pleased to see that his brother has followed in his footsteps. And is being brainwashed by Seth (The amazing Ethan Suplee) and shady gang leader Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). And Derek goes about to stop this.American History X is a mind blowing assault on the senses and the mind. And gives out a powerful message. Although at times it seems like it is trying too hard to put across that message to the audience. Edward Norton is fantastic as the Neo-Nazi skinhead, and in my opinion should have got the Oscar at the Academy Awards. Also lookout for Ethan Suplee his performance as Obese, racist, basketball player is a very different role from the slow-witted Randy in My Name Is Earl, and is also outstanding.The films message is that racial prejudice is pointless and life is too short to hate people because of their skin colour, my hope and most probably the writers hope is that this message got through to some people.9/10 Magnificent film, only thing that lets it down slightly is that it tries to hard to touch upon it's basis, but apart from that: Incredible, definitely worth a watch.

803,cvijic-58983,My history X,10,7 January 2018,"Anything before or after TV show Lost didn't start such as emotions as this film.I don't know where to start from...
HATE ...mine was nationalism type and for one time my whole childhood was under nationalism.I didn't learn from parents or anyone, we kids learn it on streets. It's ridiculous how you can HATE someone that you don't even know and we as kids didn't even know why. But human needs HATE, he needs a group of people with same ideas who would make him part of something, part of something bigger, so he can be someone. 
One period in my sixteen years long life, I was under influence of Adolf Hitler and that whole concept of national socialism and I need to confess that I was attracted to it.I had anger, fury spreading through my veins and it wasn't race anger or nationalism anger, but it needed a way to express himself and it found nazism, idea that is made of anger and fury. Scary thing is that, even yesterday when I watched this movie, I can see some truth in the philosophy of Derek Vinyard, main character of this masterpiece.My anger was HATE - HATE against system, capitalism, Church, manipulation, television and to everything that controls human and slows him down.
By the way, main actor in this movie is Edward Norton.This is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.He got so deeply in his character, that scene on beginning where cops arrest him, there is something that makes me sick.It shows the man who is lost in HATE, who is so certain in his procedures that he doesn't realise that he is just a pawn to someone bigger, more powerful.He was so proud of himself that he didn't see his little brother who was watching him doing that crime.So bizarre.
End of the movie is great.It doesn't matter how hard you try, you can't fight the HATE.And it doesn't matter if one side is trying to fight it because HATE always needs two sides. 
I'm imagining the end where Norton is shaving his head where we can see the full circle of HATE.And message at the end, DON'T HATE, it's worth it, life is too short for that. Is the black man's fault that in Sahara there is like 50 Celsius and he evolved to protect his skin.My top5 movie

804,fezmendoza,American History X is a powerful film depicting neo-Nazism and racism in America,7,1 December 2016,"American History XDelivering a powerful and controversial plot, American History X tells the story of a neo-Nazi, Californian resident, Danny Vinyard, who serves time for brutally killing three African-Americans that were breaking into his truck. The movie takes place in the 24-hour period after Danny's release from prison but also shows many plot-defining flashbacks, shown in black and white. Danny Vinyard, casted as Edward Norton, shows a full range of emotion and motive from the beginning of this movie to the end. Vinyard begins this movie by showing the audience what they expected to see: a racist, hate-filled man with no hope to change his beliefs. When his younger brother, Derek, alerts him that there are three black kids breaking into his truck, Norton grabs his gun and, without any caution for backlash, makes his way downstairs to bring what he thinks is justice to the young men outside. When authorities arrive and tell Norton to get down on his knees, he complies, lays his gun on the ground and looks at his brother. Norton knows he won't be able to speak with Derek so he says all he needs to say in this one, powerful and gut-wrenching look. At first he smiles, as to tell his younger brother that he is proud of what he's done and looks as though he even took enjoyment out of killing these men. Then he narrows his eyes and looks deep into his brother's own and without moving his lips at all, Danny lets his brother know that he must carry the torch while he is away.While in prison, Danny makes a few realizations that change his life forever. At first, he makes it known that he his a white supremacy affiliate by showing the courtyard his swastika tattoo. This gives Danny an inauguration into the ""white group"", which ensures him a bit more safety inside the walls. But when Danny realizes that all ethnicities work together to get what they want in prison, much like the normal world, he quickly turns a cold shoulder to the members of the group and attempts to fly solo for the rest of his sentence. This may have worked for him, with the occasional rape here and there, but against his will he befriends one of his fellow prisoners that he works with while doing laundry, and it just so happens that this man is black! With a new outlook on life, Danny is released from prison only to find out that Derek has shaved his head, become part of Danny's neo-Nazi organization (which has grown and become much more official since Danny's prison sentence). It is now Danny's goal to try to take off the mask of hatred that Derek now wears much like Danny had to do himself.American History X is powerful, touching, and shockingly inspirational. While parts of the movie show the darker and more twisted side of humanity, (much like the infamous curb stomp scene) I think these parts are extremely necessary and expose the racism and bigotry that lives in this country today. The darker parts only shed even more light on the positive, inspiring parts of this movie like the fact that this terrible, grotesque personality like Danny Vinyard can come all the way back from the depths of Hades and then try to save his brother from falling into the same pit. Edward Norton delivers a terrific performance and shows the world his open book of talents in this film. While Norton's performance is great, his seemed to be the only one that shined out of the rest. While there are some clips of talent here and there, these clips were short and sweet. Edward Furlong, who played Derek Vinyard, fell very short in my eyes. His performance seemed more like it belonged on Lifetime than it did on the big screen. One thing I noticed, that I feel compelled to mention, is the major abuse of the extreme close up shots. Whether it's faces, showers, or a basketball game, this movie seems to always fit an ECU frame in almost every scene to the point where it's extremely noticeable and quite imposing. The movie's plot and screenplay were great but it all felt very rushed. The flow from scene to scene was abrupt and I often found myself feeling disconnected to the characters, even Norton's, due to the lack of background story. Danny's motive as a neo-Nazi was a bit unclear. It's understood that his father was killed by African-Americans, and that before then his father is shown telling him a very racist lecture in a dinner conversation but other than that the viewer is really left to wonder why there is so much passion in hate within this man. All in all, American History X is well worth the watch especially if you have an interest in history, social, cultural or psychological issues.",American History X

The idea and subsequent story actually has a lot of potential, but it is ruined by the movies weird cinematography (black and white to show scenes in the past??) and quite frankly terribly dialogue and acting by everyone except for Norton, who i thought was the only solid actor.

818,AJ-33,UNDERRATED,10,26 July 1999,"I think this film has been severely underrated by critics who say that the film's only merit is Edward Norton's masterful performance.  American History X is so much more than that.  I would venture to call this film a masterpiece, certainly one of my favorites and the best movie of 1998, along with Saving Private Ryan.  The film is very well-crafted and the flashbacks are poignant as well as powerful in showing how the events surrounding one person can affect so many people around him.  I tended to forget that the flashbacks were in black-and-white since the images stayed with me long after watching the film.  Also, this is one of those films where repeated viewings enhances the pleasure.  At first viewing, it is hard to understand the importance or effect of the flashbacks, but after the second viewing the story fits in perfectly.  Director Tony Kaye was so displeased with the finished project (his first film, have you) that he attempted to give the director's credit in an alias, (which I think was Humpty Dumpty). Anyway, if this is what he considers an embarrassment then I am very interested in seeing some of his future works.  And by the way, Stanley Kubrick, whom Kaye reportedly compared himself to, also disowned his first feature film.  And as for the cynics who say that the ending is a misfire, I think it is brilliant.  It leaves so many questions opened; Will Derek return to hate? Will his family ever recover? Who is to blame for the problems in society? These questions really remind me of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.  I am eagerly awaiting Tony Kaye's future projects, but I guess he won't make another film for about 5 or six years.",American History X

Still a great film, it could and should have been so much more with better care. Kaye's shot the film himself and his visuals are unbelievably good. However, the films driving force is Norton, who should have won the Oscar. We completely understand his character, and he makes a villainous, despicable young man's arc to reformed ex-con seemless. Beverly D'Angelo, Edward Furlong and Stacy Keach are all fine. However, Avery Brooks isn't used enough, and the jail scenes don't stand up with the rest of the film.",American History X

He was the actor in the movie "" Primal Fear"". I nearly cannot recognize him due to the dramatic change in his physical appearance. As a matter of fact, he is a good actor and he deserves to get the nomination of Oscar Actor. In this film, the director described the thoughts of a racist in very detail, why he thought like that and the impact of the environment and the peer group on his own. Especially in a dinner scene, what Derek says which really shocked me. But i do not prefer using the black and white screen to represent the past. Here, I highly recommend this movie to the people, to see that how stubborn people will be when they choose to have a belief without any doubts even killing people. The most hardest part in human to be changed would be the stereotype, bias and discrimination, the most horrible is that these thoughts can be past over and over the generation like Derek and his father.",American History X

I went into the cinema expecting a similar film to 'ROMPER STOMPER' depicting a skinhead gang being violent. What I got was not the story of a group, but the frightfully realistic tale of an individual.  With Ed Norton playing the powerful lead role as the confused Nazi, I found myself holding my breath or feeling physically sick throughout every scene.  Near the end I was disappointed to see the beginnings of a typical 'Hollywood' happy ending,  but my feelings soon changed when the conclusion shifted to an incredibly powerful and emotional end.

I was tired . . .What the hell is this thing, I thought, having rented it on the recommendation of a young bloke at my Video Store. More pushing of ideological barrows, plus manipulation by shaming, and guilt induction?After two hours glued to the screen, I felt wonderfully refreshed and surprisingly alert.The presentation and acting seemed, to my in-expert eye, to be excellent, to say the least - no problems there  at all.The idea underlying the story seemed to throw my emotions about considerably - well done.The White American Hero says that he is ""pissed off"" with being ""pissed off"". The Black American Teacher admits to the same thing.  I realised that the film pointed up the all too human condition of blind ego-centric living, a blind condition in which I share.A wise man once wrote that the the word ""Blame"" should be struck from our vocabulary.  The rationalisations of the feelings of being ""pissed off"" almost invariably lead to the projecting of my own shortcomings onto ""them"". ""They"" are the cause of all my troubles etc etc.  This is not to deny that every resentment has a ""hook"" in people, things, and circumstances upon which to hang.Notwithstanding, I thought, the viscious cycle of the mentality of hate cannot be broken by mindlessly blaming others for what is also deeply entrenched in my own heart and mind.This film, in my experience tonight, deserves high commendation for laying bare the reality of my part in the human condition, and in giving me a clear and timely call whenever I feel ""pissed off"", no matter my colour, creed, gender, or status.Painful? yes.

829,Joe-560,one of the best movies ever made,10,23 December 2002,"American History X is a powerful, emotionally devastating opus of beauty that should be viewed and experienced by all. Tony Kaye and David McKenna have done something extroardinary in seeing hate and racism from the POV of the American neo-Nazi, and helped us see more than we could have hoped for. The film's underlying theme was simple: life is too short to be p****d off all the time. Edward Norton's dynamic performance was his best to date, showing a grand transformation of the intelligent yet simple-minded young man who, while in an emotionally hateful and racist frame of mind, speaks certain truths that most of us wish were not the facts. However, it is only after befriending a black inmate in prison that he learns see things from a wider perspective, through all the b******t and propaganda that he has learned and taught others. He realizes that yes, maybe it is true that one in every three black males is in some form of a correctional facility. Maybe most black Americans have been using their past history of slavery to promote white guilt and frighten white Americans into recession. But the even harder truth to face is that Norton's hate had so consumed him that he failed to see any options other than blaming blacks and minorities for all of the country's problems. Hate consumed his mind and disabled it. This is one of the best movies ever made and one of my favorites. I have been watching Norton since Primal Fear and I know that he will go far as an actor.

One of the sons, after a stint in jail, has a change of heart and decides to save his little brother from the mindless hatred that nearly ruined his life.This film tries so hard to be a gritty, dark, morality tale of modern western life that it ends up parodying itself unintentionally.  I'm afraid a few angst ridden actors smoking and shouting out a lot of swear words does not a great movie make.The movie also has two of the stupidest moments on film.  Why the brothers, one of whom has just escaped death at the hands of his former gang, decide to sit and have a nice chat about life rather than run to the nearest phonebox and warn mom and sis (who are sitting passively at home like women do) is unrealistic.  Perhaps it didn't cross the boys minds.   Dumber still is why any self-respecting, skinhead gang did NOT immediately go to the boy's home and kill and destroy is beyond comprehension.  But perhaps it didn't cross their collective minds.The second stupidest moment on film ever is this film's ending.Do yourself a favour and see ""Romper Stomper"" if you want a truer reflection of the evils of skinhead violence.",American History X

You want to wake up the neighborhood so that they too, can learn, see and feel what you just have.And it was a beautiful bright 16 year old girl that brought this to me. Never think the young don't truly know, you may very well miss out on a lesson that brings you 180 back around to why you protested the wrongs of life to begin with.",American History X
833,sybolies,"Worn out pseudo issue of racism, overdone again",1,16 July 2000,"For it's appeal this movie relied entirely on dramatics based on pseudo racial tensions -- just like you see in almost all everyday boring media -- and the dramatics take on the same worn out theme of white supremacy aimed at the underprivileged black. Of course classism and other infinitely weightier issues are ignored in this type of black-and-white scenario. This issue is so overdone and so inaccurate that movies portraying it are at once passe and dangerously erroneous from a social standpoint.If you like drama that rams its theme home by beating you over the head with theatrics, and if you are uneducated enough to believe that simple discrimination results from something as superficial as skin color, then you will probably like this movie and even think it's profound. If you appreciate the subtle beauty in life and understand how nearly all issues have depth beyond their specious veneer, this movie will just be another tired rendition added to the multitude of preceding ones that pivot from the same worn and ridiculous theme -- racism.",American History X

What separates most antisocial young men from most healthy ones is pure luck, but of course there are also many who suffer that have the sort of perspective this film grants the viewer.Now, the cathartic relief of ruining my life - and the lives of those around me, which I hadn't truly considered before - isn't very tempting.",American History X

838,evergreengrad,"Uncompromising, unrelenting, unyielding",9,3 January 2007,"American History X attempts to do what many would consider unthinkable; to take a vile, disgusting neo-Nazi and portray him into a hero. How exactly does it go about doing that? By showing us his human side. Derek Vinyard's (Ed Norton,)father is killed by a group of black kids. Filled with rage, he becomes prey for Cameron Alexander (Stacey Keach,) leader of the local Aryan Brotherhood. Derek makes a name for himself,and it's not long before he lands himself in the clink. To his own surprise, he befriends an African-American convict (Guy Torry,) who ends up saving his life when Derek's skinhead buddies turn against him. Upon his release, he is disturbed to see his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) following in Big Brother's footsteps.I first rented this film out of curiosity, thinking it would portray racism in the typical Hollywood, sugar-coated fashion. Oh, how wrong I was. It was easily one of the most brutal films ever. Norton gives an outstanding performance, at once terrifying and yet uncomfortably human. Edward Fulong is also solid as the young, confused Danny. Beverly D'Angelo (as their mother,) Elliot Gould and Avery Brooks as teachers at their school, and Fairuza Balk as Derek's Nazi girlfriend all lend strong support, but, ultimately, it is Norton's show, and he runs with it.",American History X

It is an amazing film, meant for a mature audience. However, I plan on watching it with my Son when he is confronted with racial issues. I feel it is an important film for him to watch, because it goes far to explain why kids join neo-nazi hate groups and it does an outstanding job of showing why the beliefs of those hate groups are wrong. Hate is a delicate subject and American History X is able to balance our disgust with our quest for answers to the eternal ""Why?"" question.Edward Norton is amazing in this movie. I am glad he was nominated for his performance, because he deserved at least that much. His ability to transform his look and demeanor from scene to scene is about the best I have ever seen. But more than his performance, he, and the rest of the cast, should be commended for having the courage to take on such controversial roles. Great Film!",American History X

845,djamesc,The most powerful movie I have ever seen,8,2 September 2001,"I only saw this film recently but it completely blew me away. I have been meaning to watch it forever, many's the time I picked it up in the video store only to see another film that I wanted to see and for some reason, American History X always went back on the shelf. This time though I decided to finally watch it, and I am glad that I did and annoyed that I didn't sooner. This film is unbelievable, I can't remember the last time I was unable to take my eyes from the screen, I was literally on the edge of my seat, completely entranced. At the end I was stunned, shocked you might say, this film really made me think and made it impossible to sleep afterwards (I guess deciding to watch it at 1 am was a bad idea)This is an important film. First of all it gives us a real insight into the way the minds work of these white supremacists. Their completely irrational hatred. Not thinking for themselves, following like sheep because they now have a target for their anger. The way it affects the people around them and the costs involved.I will give you a run down of the plot. Well basically what happens is that a young man (the ever brilliant Edward Norton) gets involved in a white supremacists group, eventually leading to him murdering two men. He goes to prison, and after 3 years he is released a changed man - only to find that his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, and yes, it is the annoying kid from T2!) is now involved in the same group, Derek now faces a struggle to get his brother and the rest of his family away from white supremacy and convince them that hating for the sake of hating is wrong and all it does is eat you up inside.Like I said, this film completely blew me away, for many reasons - The script, the direction, the message and the fantastic acting ability of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong (once you realise he can act and stop praying that Arnie will pop up and shoot him).This film has real power, it carries a message, a very clear message. It's not all preachy and patronising. It carries the message over very powerfully and movingly.WARNING:  You will feel drained at the end of this movie so make sure you don't operate heavy machinery :)",American History X
846,jazzadelic,good film that could have been great,6,13 October 2001,"Racists in movies usually don't get treated like real characters in films. Usually they're seen as the guys in white masks that nobody ever who never even get to utter more then a few cliche lines. My guess as to why is that in an age of political correctness most filmmakers are afraid to dig deep into the psyche of the average racist. In Happiness, film makers showed a pedophile without judgement. In Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who is not only treated like a real character but is actually likeable! If they can do that in a film then surely should be able to make a film that portrays racism in a realistic and thought provoking manner. American History X is a good movie for that reason. It is the first film since Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" that deals with racism in a frank and open way and is unafraid of offending it's audience. What keeps ""American History X"" from being a great film (like ""Do the Right Thing"")is that some of the characters' actions seem contrived to fit the plot. Edward Norton's character is awfully wishy washy for a guy with deeply felt convictions. In one scene, he's talking about how much he hates blacks, then joking around with a black is enough to make him the picture of love and acceptance. Also, the film has a shock ending that does not make sense and confuses the message of the movie.",American History X
847,bendy_boy,"Fantastic, moving, powerful...",10,27 November 2001,"This may very well be the best film I have ever seen, probably the first movie to tackle the topic of racial hatred in such a full-on way without ever once reverting to tokenism and/or victimisation of one group to make its point.While the main story revolves around white supremacists Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his brother Danny (Edward Fulrong), racism is universal. This is a film about racism in ALL its forms and the effect it has on the people who practice and preach it and their loved ones.  This is a point summed up in Bob Sweeney's (Avery Brooks) question to Derek: ""has anything you've done made your life better?""* * * SPOILER AHEAD * * *The ending is fantastic, poignant and intentionally ambiguous.  It challenges you and has you thinking for days afterwards.  How does Derek come to terms with this after all he has been through?  Is this crime motivated by hatred for Danny and Derek, brought on by the actions of Derek and others like him?  Or is this just senseless racism in another form?This is a movie that never lets up.  The it refuses to hide the violence but is never gratuitous or glamorized but it IS brutal - the ""put your mouth on the kerb"" scene is not Tarantino-esqe violence, but is far more disturbing. Likewise the prison rape scene.The power of this film is helped no end by completely believable performances by all the principal actors.  Edward Norton, as always, is brilliant, and having only regarded Edward Furlong as a pin-up boy until I saw this film, I was blown away by his performance as the impressionable Danny.  A special mention goes to Beverly D'Angelo, who puts in the performance of her life as Doris, the boys' mother - who could believe she played another mother in the role of Ellen Griswold in the abysmal ""National Lampoon"" movies?It's obvious that the actors had a real passion for the subject matter and threw themselves 110% into performances which must have been very demanding.All in all, a fantastic experience for viewers who want a film which challenges them and leaves them questioning for days.

When I heard of this movie, I expected the mindless bashing of Nazis. While I personally consider it plain wrong, I feared this movie just would not go deep enough, and I would forget the next day. But I was wrong, I think I will always remember this movie when I discuss the topic, and believe me, when you are german like me, you discuss it a lot. The story itself is very simple; An american neo nazi rises to the top of the local gang. His brother admires him and follows his footsteps, but when the older brother goes too jail for killing two black men, he sees and experiences things that change his mind, and when he comes out he tries to save his brother. The story is fairly standard...just the way the story is presented makes the movie exceptional. Furlong and especially Norton give outstanding performances, and all the other characters are very well portrayed. And I do not agree with some reviewers who say the 180 deegree change of Derek is unreallistic...I hope and I actually BELIEVE that a person can change, see their own mistakes, through open minded thinking. There is now wrong philosophy, but following without thinking is wrong (my opinion, but I feel this is what the movie is trying to say too). I say you have too see the movie. Chances are you will not like it. You might hate it. But the chance that it gives you inspiration to think about a very grim and never to be forgotten part of human (not german, american, HUMAN) history are enough to justify spending two hours of your life on it.",American History X

For whom should the support go to? Which side does the protagonist fight for? How well do they achieve ""equality"" in the end?This is not most films. It's almost impossible to not take a stand while portraying a social issue. But that's where brilliance lies. This film taken a journalistic view on the subject. And it goes deep in it's research on why the protagonist picks his side in a visibly unequal society. We travel with the protagonist, what logic does he apply to his actions? Where did it all start for him? What took for his views to change?And it isn't like a documentary.. it never gets boring. You walk into the lives of black gangs, white gangs, jews, mexicans.. each group with their own story to tell.It's a film that requires an extraordinary performance for it to be subtle and convincing.

Disturbing, yes. Eye-opener as well, yes. This movie was the perfect example of how much a person's feelings of prejudice can hurt people, whether it be to themselves, or to those around them. Although this movie was very brutal in it's violence and language, those elements were not just thrown in randomly. They were what really made the movie, while controversial, also extremely well done. It was a harsh look at how much racism can damage a family and the people they love. The Cinematography was beautiful, with flashbacks shot in black and white. Tony Kaye did a superb job directing and he really showed his talent for making a touching film. The script was very well-written; harsh and stinging at times but very clever and profound. Edward Norton gave the performance of his career in my opinion, besides Primal Fear (both of which got him nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Actor). Also Edward Furlong shines as Edward Norton's younger brother, Danny. Stacy Keach, Elliot Gould, Avery Brooks, and Beverly D'Angelo also give very good performances.

The acting is first rate from all the characters and the story is conveyed beautifully through this and the use of black and white cinematography is an enlightened choice for so many analytical and subversive ways. i would recommend this film to anyone over the age of 15 especially those whose have a racist beliefs because it can show people just how flawed the 'perfect race' ideal is.",American History X

But it really makes me upset and angry at the end of the story. Isn't the last part when Danny is killed utterly redundant? I know it means to bring up the complicated feelings of the audience toward the problem the movie is dealing with. But hell no, it only makes me realize how serious and impotent America's gun control policy is. Are you going to blame racism when a freaking high school student is able to get hold of a gun so easily? When weapons that are so powerful such as guns are so handy and prevalent, killing is just a matter that could be done so easily. When something could be done very easily, would its happening be a surprise? It just happens, like all other easy matters like dropping a glass on the floor. You're not gonna blame on anything for such things. It just happens. Love and peace propaganda will only appear feeble and useless, and the safety of your life can't rely on human's subjectivity. I don't know America's gun policy well, but if in fact it's strictly conducted all the time, then my anger over this film is justified for it exaggerates the reality just for its dramatic effects.

The essentials are met - i.e. great cast, great acting, great directing etc. but more importantly, is the way the film dealt with the issue it explores and its opinions of it. At first it disects all the dynamic and sensitive emotions and reactions of a typical western/white race who's population is becoming increasingly racially integrated. This in itself is something people have wanted to put into film without it becoming more of a documentary. This film does that brilliantly. By the end, we have a very clever appreciation of why this happens and why racism is a failure of society. It is something that we deal with every day and that we all have an opinion on. This compromises most of those and seems to conclude with something every one can sympathize with - that it is a virtually uncontrollable situation, and that fear and confusion is the driving force behind it from all corners of the globe.It is certainly a film that I could watch over and over, and enjoy it more every time. It is leagues ahead of all films in its area and is certainly one of the best i have personally ever seen.

The first time I watched it, I sat there as it ended, and I was just completely in a state of shock. This movie, more than any other movie I had seen on the subject of racism, really made me think twice about how I treated people of a different race. The way that Derek Vinyard's family was almost completely split apart and destroyed due to his racist beliefs should be a wake-up call to those people who have any racist beliefs whatsoever. I believe that this movie was a whole lot more than just a ground-breaking, controversial drama; it was a portrayal of exactly how much damage can be done to a family and a nation simply because of the hate for a person or people of a different color, for almost no reason at all. The Bible says that ""God created man in his own image."" It also says to, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" which, right there, implies that racism is not something people should even consider. I wouldn't recommend that anyone under the age of 16 see this movie due to its graphic content and language; however, I believe that everyone who is over the age of 16, should see this movie at least once.

866,jennydawn00,A moving story involving someone that wants to better himself.,10,8 September 2004,"Wow...what more can I say about this movie. It is very in your face and deep. It shows why so many Americans just stay the way that they are, they know how hard it is to change. I think that Edward Norton does an excellent job of being the jerk that tries and better himself while still living in the same world that he is trying to get out of. The only part about this movie that bothered me was why was his little brother killed? Why wasn't he killed for his crimes and then change of heart that did not sit well with his friends. His poor little brother was trying to make sense of everything that was going on in his world, and just when he was starting to understand it and learn how to change it, he was killed. If you do not like gruesome acts of violence, then this movie is not for you because there is one part, the part that shows you why the lead character goes to jail, that is unbelievably gruesome, you will think about it before you sleep, and probably during. If you are not faint of heart and would like to learn a little bit about neo-nazism, this is a great movie. I definitely give this movie a ten.",American History X
867,litasnum1,It Stays with You,6,21 February 2019,"Today, I found myself changing my initial rating. I had originally given it 4 stars for kinda disliked, but changed it to 6 for kinda liked, for the simple fact that I think about this movie often. Maybe I rated it so low before because its depth got to me. The character arc of Derek, portrayed by Edward Norton to sheer perfection, is amazing, to make an understatement. The magnifying lens into people's souls is thought - provoking unlike anything else I've ever seen, most notably when the most ironic of climaxes occurs. Because of their lack of true racism, Derek denounces the Aryan Brotherhood and is raped, beaten and left for dead, only for him to be saved by Lamont, a black - man. To see the anguish Derek endures to try to repair his misdeeds, first through his friendship with Lamont, and later through his little brother is heart - wrenching and for Danny (Edward Furlong) to make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of racism provided a visceral reaction few movies have gotten from me. I cried. It was sad to see someone's little brother die. I was sad for Derek. I was sad for humanity.",American History X
868,BliuTiger,Didn't really impress me,6,13 January 2013,"It's a bit tough for me to review this one. Some of my friends said it's one of the best movies out there, a true classic. So I gave it a try and in the end it left me a little unimpressed.I don't have much to say about it because it failed to truly captivate me with its story and characters. The main theme is racism, but I didn't feel this movie explored it in a completely satisfying way, or at least in a way I haven't seen before. The story was pretty simple: the guy is a delinquent (Neo-Nazi), we see his life, he goes to prison, gets some kind of a realization after bonding with a black man, decides that his past lifestyle was wrong and becomes a better man after he's released from prison.At some points of the movie, I felt that the actions by some characters weren't appropriate or literally came out of nowhere with no build up like Derek murdering people in the middle of the street. And the moment at which film didn't do well was the most important one - the scene in which Derek realizes the consequences of his actions, how bad of a person he was and how little he devoted himself to his family. It just left me unsatisfied. It wasn't captured very well. The events that were supposed to lead him to this point lacked a bit in the execution department. The script left much to be desired here.With that said, this is not a bad movie. There are some great performances here. Norton and Furlong did a particularly great job. Danny's tragic fate also offers something to think about. However, the shortcomings of script and execution prevent it from being truly great. As it stands, it's just an OK film with an obvious message - racism is bad, don't be a delinquent.",American History X
869,hitman624,The Brother-Brother relationship,8,25 January 2005,"Every time I see this movie the one thing that jumps out at me is how real the relationship between the brothers is. Remove all the Nazi subtext and the relationship between Derek and Danny is exactly like the one I had with my older brother. I've never seen another film capture the essence of an older brother's influence over his younger brother. This film not only does that but makes it a major element to the story. I, myself also have an older brother. The difference in age is the same as it appears to be in American History X. Let me tell you, if my older brother HAD been a destructive neo nazi like Derek, I probably would have been too, just like Danny. I played the same sports my brother did. I watched the same movies. I listened to the same music. I tried to emulate him in every way possible. Even recently I started a job with a local utility company. The same job he started in when he was my age. American History X does an excellent job of showing the remarkable influence of an older brother, and how he accepts the responsibility that comes with it. When Sweeney visits Derek in jail, he tells him that his younger brother is headed down the same path as he is. Derek immediately shoots back that Danny is not his responsibility. Whether Derek wants the responsibility or not, he has great influence over Danny and must use it responsibly. Unfortunately, Derek realizes this too late. That's the essence of this story to me. The struggle of an older brother to save himself in order to save his younger brother. Ed Norton plays both the responsible and the irresponsible Derek magically. This film goes from being a good film to a great film because of his performance. The most realistic portrayal I've ever seen of someone dealing with family problems. 8 Stars out of 10.",American History X
870,millie-wild,i-n-c-r-e-d-i-b-l-e,10,9 September 2013,"Edward Norton's compelling and powerful performance of a highly misguided neo-nazi convict is a gripping and highly convincing one, and alongside Edward Furlong, this is an unmissable but hauntingly true interpretation by Tony Kaye that really brings home a message that's stuck with me forever.Whether it was just a cleverly written script, a good director or an excellent cast, I'll never know but what ever it is, it works and it works very well.Both Edward's reflect their prime ability to act with their portrayal of a fractured background and how it's influenced their behaviours and attitudes. It's an emotion evoking display from all the cast and a classic, classic film.",American History X
871,lemrogers,Emotional Manipulation at it's finest,9,21 May 2015,"American History X – Emotional Manipulation at its finest Films are made with the intention to entertain, to document and to tell a story, but the ones that stand out from the crowd are those that dictate audience emotions; something Tony Kaye has mastered in American History X. Of course, this film isn't for everyone and it's this emotional manipulation that is perhaps the reason why as viewers may not take a submissive stance and refuse to allow themselves to be controlled this way but for me, Kaye's unconventional take on emotional response makes AHX one of the best films of its generation. The narrative and stylistic techniques used by Kaye, McKenna and crew create such incredible levels of realism throughout a film where the majority of viewers will not be able to relate but alas this doesn't matter to us, we still feel just as connected, or disconnected in certain ways, to the characters and events, specifically the brothers Danny and Derek. On the surface, two 'despicable' human beings with little to no positive attributes but Kaye blurs the lines between hero and villain magnificently with Derek's redemption story and his little brother's longing for guidance. The inner battle that we see Derek, and eventually Danny, go through, makes their transformations even more spectacular. Kaye's ability to produce this emotion is what makes the film so powerful and no scene displays this as much as the basketball scene.Without spoiling the film, the scene basically portrays Derek and his gang taking on another group, race vs race, in a game of basketball. Now if Kaye were to take away all the abusive and racist dialogue from both camps, as well as the prominent symbolism of the swastika, the audience would be forgiven for thinking this was just another underdog sports movie: the protagonist manages to win against all odds even despite the opposition cheating. It's Kaye's magnificent use of both the dialogue and the symbolism that make this such a chilling and powerful scene. Almost everything about this sequence makes us want to cheer for Derek with the camera work focusing significantly on his team and emotional crescendos popping up every time Derek scores a basket, courtesy of Anne Dudley who makes the whole film ripe with tension. The manipulation is so perfect, we become dragged along with their triumphant victory and we come to ask ourselves who the real villains are in the scene. We're brought right back down to earth, feeling completely ashamed that we essentially cheered on such despicable characters, however, by the symbolism of the swastika on Derek's chest and the vile dialogue. It's this technique that Kaye uses to cement this inner conflict within the audience, often switching from scenes of moral progression to flashbacks of Derek in his heyday. Pulling away from that scene and to the whole film in general, the overall emotional response that it creates within audiences is something which I've rarely, if ever, experienced watching a film. Edward Norton gives what might just be the best performance of his career providing such raw emotion with simple glazes into the camera and his co-star Edward Furlong portrays the younger brother looking for a path to follow perfectly. The cinematography gives some of the greatest shots seen in modern cinema, with Kaye also not afraid to make use of obvious tropes such as slow-mo and chilling sound to create tension. Still, these work magnificently throughout the film, creating memorable moment after memorable moment, none perhaps more memorable than the infamous 'curb stomp' which was done to perfection. Of course, with the subject matter it has, the film has attracted some controversy, with viewers suggesting Derek's redemption was accepted too easily and portrays an unrealistically swift realisation amongst both brothers, but for me, that's what makes this film great. Not only is it a powerful character study but it also puts across a strong message. Kaye is brutal and unbiased in the film as all races are 'thrown to the dogs' so to speak. Unfortunately, there are still so many children like Danny being moulded by their environments in the wrong way and whilst progress is still being made, it isn't happening fast enough.",American History X
872,fmpemy,to make it simple.... amazing,10,20 January 2005,"I can't even begin to comment on how moving this film is. Not moving as in pro Nazi-ism, but on how hatred can ruin America's culture and modern society. I love this film, although it is very abrupt and forward. it does a wonderful job of accomplishing the goals that the filmmakers (i believe) were hoping to accomplish. My favorite shot of the whole film was when Derrick finished unloading his clip at the car driving away, and they go to a shot of Derrick walking back to the wounded gang member. They put it in slow mo to emphasize the anger and hatred on his face. This shot goes far deeper than any other shot of the same length would. This even shows how damn good of an actor Edward Norton is. This film is just so powerful, and just so moving that I could talk all day about it.",American History X
873,fernandofmarte,This is a really good movie,9,28 February 2005,"I believe that he is already, but this should'be made Edward Norton a superstar. I think the movie is a bit flawed. The ending was shocking, but didn't make ALL THAT MUCH sense to me (for those who've seen it, I just don't get fully why it was done?), but Norton's character carried the entire movie. I recommend this movie to everyone. Fight Club was cool, and it is also really good, but damn, this kid could do anything. Watch him here, then watch Death to Smoochy. It's hard to believe that it's the same actor. It sucks that good roles only go to Cruise, Pitt, and Hanks all the time. I'm not knocking them at all, but Hollywood should give Norton more of a chance. He definitely deserved it after this flick.",American History X

Finally a movie thats not an attempt at a romantic comedy or a senseless action movie. This movie touches upon some really sensitive issues..its one of the best I've seen..right from the acting to the storyline. Edward Norton is a brilliant actor..and i believe that this is his best performance. 10/10..all the way!! Watch this movie with an open mind..and it'll definitely make you feel a lot differently about some issues. No wonder this movie is in the top 50 of all time.The dialog's are great and the movie manages to stay away from the trap of being too violent (credit to the director for that),American History X

But I can honestly say that I am so glad that I did cause it's one of my favorite movies now. I love everything about it. I guess I'm different but the part were Derek makes the guy bite the curb is a part I like....not because of anyone's color just because he is protecting what is his. But I also love the fact that it shows that anyone can change themselves into being a better person, with a more open and loving heart. I hate the fact that the family is almost torn apart and that the little brother dies. For me the ending could or would have been better if both brothers had been able to change and lived a happy, loving life. But all in all I love it.",American History X
876,lodi_70005,Great until the end,8,24 August 2006,"This movie definitely deserves a spot in the top 250. I gave it an 8 out of ten, but I can easily see why other posters would give it a ten. I could not give this movie a ten because it is not one of those classics that I can watch over and over. The movie is a roller coaster ride that I felt should have ended on a high note. Sure, I am not a fan of the cliché ""perfect Hollywood ending"". However, this is one film that I felt should not have ended in the most depressing way imaginable. I have read some comments on IMDb.com about the director having problems with the ending. He even went so far as trying to have his name taken off the credits and replaced with ""Humpty Dumpty"". I must say that I agree with him. Since I know that the younger brother will die in the end it prevents me from watching this movie very often as it is just too depressing. I think a good alternative ending would have Norton's character held back for the rest of his life by his record. He is way too intelligent to enjoy life while having to work as some sort of laborer for the rest of his life. The irony would have been ""an eye for an eye"" as he ruined lives by committing manslaughter and there is nothing worse for an extremely smart person to dig ditches for a living. This is something I can definitely relate to. However, his younger brother often supports him financially in the future as a payback for saving him from a life of ""naziism"". Norton's character is punished for his sins, yet there is some redemption for turning his back on the nazi's which regarded him as a hero. That is how I would have ended the movie if I was given the script. This alternate ending would be far from your stock ""Hollywood happy ending"", without being so depressing.",American History X

Is an emblematic film against fascism and Nazism! tragic finale that shows the hole true of the the situation in school nowadays and the danger that our kids are involved every single day! The summary of the film in my opinion is that parents they have to upbringing their children to a open-minded and friendly family environment. Parents' hazardous believes propagandize children minds and transform them from good little people to an ""atomical future youthful bomb"". Mainly parents are responsible for theirs children delinquent behaviors and actions and first of all we have to blame them for the tragic incidence and not the children. Luckily there are several teachers nowadays who still believe that is their duty to rehabilitate delinquent teens and the most important part is that there are people that still believe in human kindness.",American History X
878,donnamae-32782,Overall this is a good film,8,18 August 2017,"Years have past since Danny saw his neo-nazi brother, kill several black males who were robbing his car. Since he has been in prison, Derek's legacy has grown among the white gangs of the area and Danny has followed in his brother's footsteps. When he writes a racist paper for school, his teacher makes his write a new paper, focusing on recent history – that of his brother and how he influenced him. Meanwhile Derek leaves prison a reformed man with only the desire to repair the damage he once did to his family with his beliefs and his hate.I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves). It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film. Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his 'sins'. As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film. It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment. The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong). The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction – the characters and the film's world seem very real. The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point. One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's 'road to Damascus' experience in prison – it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in. In b&w flashback he is at his best – a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug. Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required. In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow. Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed – Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a 'morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.Overall this is a good film, which occasionally struggles when it forces the issue in the 'present' scenes. However for the most part it is a powerful film which owes a lot to well captured themes and an excellent performance from Norton.",American History X
879,connorwilliams-22774,A failed redemption done RIGHT!!!!!,10,8 September 2019,"I watched the film for the first time knowing absolutely nothing about it. and I did NOT expect it to end the way it did. The whole movie I was expecting Derek to redeem himself for his actions and behaviours he's exhibited throughout his life, until THE VERY END, I was convinced that people CAN change their ways even if they are an extremely horrible type of person. But I like to believe that Derek will go back to his old ways due to the death of his brother Danny.This is why I believe that this movie is the perfect example of a redemption storyline that turns back around at the very end, as a viewer you think the movie will end with the main character changing his ways only to potentially revert back for the SAME reason he ever became a neo-nazi in the first place.Amazing film.

881,quena,Amazing beyond words,10,9 November 2005,"Edward Norton and Edward Furlong give a flawless and incredible performance. American History x is a phenomenally written movie that is TERRIBLY UNDERRATED. Perhaps it was the controversy surrounding this film that caused it to be silenced in the media, I only got to watch it because of ""chance"" (luckily I heard it from a website). Anyways, it's about a man named Derek whose life is presented out in pieces throughout the film on his Neo-Nazi beliefs, and the progression of his recovery in prison to discover his beliefs and anger have only destroyed him throughout the years. He then must prevent his brother Daniel from pursuing the same path. This movie is beyond words. It is definitely in the Top 10 movies I have ever seen. There are just no words to describe how moved I felt when the film was done. I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for watching a fantastic movie. To be more accurate, I would give this movie 9.9/10, not a perfect score because the ending was too sad.",American History X
882,atala21,Those crazy Neos,10,22 September 2005,"Jesus, that was a wonderful film.From beginning to end,this movie is a wild mechanical bull ride.It begins sadly, and it ends yet worse. It was really an emotional roller-coaster, at least it should be if you have empathy towards other human beings.It is beautifully directed, i enjoyed the way in which the screen would turn black and white during flash backs, Edward Norton looked more impressive that way, and in slow motion.I am not a Neo Nazi or Skin Head, but that tattoo which Norton's character bore on his chest was simply amazing. He was a sort of Fuhrer, for the twenty-first century, somebody who we could relate to better than we could Hitler, as gangs in the slums are something which is common today, and quite out of control.Tony Kaye was an amazing director in this film, he delivered it quite realistically, and it was hard not to be touched by such a dramatic series of unfortunate events. This is not to mention Edward Norton's acting, which was even better than on the set of Fight Club.

Unlike the hot new Oscar Winning movie about race ""Crash"" which was much more contrived and star-studded, ""American History X"" features the gritty and realistic side of racism instead.Filmed both in Black and White (with the scenes involving the past events) and color (with the present tense) the film moved at a pace which totally envelopes the viewer. Even though some scenes are extremely graphic and often hard to watch, the violence and gore in the movie is not gratouitous or without meaning. Each time there is a gun or a fist in this movie it is to make a serious point, and or a display of power from different characters.Actors Edward Norton and Edward Furlong offer the performances of both of there lifetimes as the closely knit brothers Danny and Derek. Norton, as Derek, is especially chilling as a Neo-Nazi turned Redemption Seeker in the story.This is an extremely important and very timely movie.

886,applejackjed,"AN ABSOLUTE POWER HOUSE OF EMOTION, AND CONTROVERSY",10,22 November 2018,"Director Tony Kane's American History X not only displays the brutality of racism, but how it effects your family and the conflicts that rise from casual dinner arguments, and how hatred just drags you down and doesn't do anything at all to help you solve your problems. Instead, it just creates more problems. Edward Norton has given one of the best performances of his career. He plays a Neo Nazi Skinnhead who is sentenced to seven years in prison for a horrific act of manslaughter. During his time in the joint, he befriends an inmate who happens to be black. His friendship with the inmate changes his perspective on racism and how wrong it really is. Norton's character Derek, has a little brother named Danny (Edward Furlong) who has always looked up to Derek, starts to head down the same path his older brother once did. Having the scenes of Derek being a Skinnhead, shot in black and white was an absolutely brilliant idea. Because if there is one thing black and white cinematography does now a days is present a dark and depressing tone, which is exactly what you feel when you experience these scenes. Beverly Diangelo delivers a captivating and heartbreaking performance as a widow. It had been awhile since we've seen a performance like this. Diangelo said in an interview ""this was her first take on a dramatic role."" Well let me tell you, not bad for her first take on Drama, not bad at all. American History will perhaps go down in ""History"" as one the most contraversial films ever made, and one of the most brutal, other than that, it's got an honest story, captivating performances, and an extremely emotional ending.

It seems strange that I despise this movie with such venom while other people hold it up as a perfect piece of work. Maybe my standards are higher. Maybe I've seen so many movies that I can see cliches more clearly than most. Maybe I expected more from a film with an ambition to change the world. Maybe I'm feeling disappointment because it failed so completely.I think ""American History X"" is a complete waste of your time. This is the story of a neo-Nazi named Derek who repents and gets out of prison just in time to save his kid brother Danny, who is going down the same skinhead path. That's the whole story. Everything else is atmosphere and complication, with sermons at every turn. I can understand why the director wanted to remove his name from the picture.Likewise, I can understand why Edward Norton was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Derek, the jailbird brother. Norton is one of our best actors and squeezes lots of blood from this stone of a production. His speech rhythms and body language are wonderful. However, I can't find anything else to recommend apart from Norton's performance. The script is preachy, predictable, simplistic and badly staged. Edward Furlong is useless as Danny the baby skinhead, and the annoying fat guy who blabbers Nazi platitudes is one of the worst actors I have ever seen in a major motion picture. The black-and-white flashback device would be laughable in a film school thesis, and it's embarrassing to see it used here. It took all my strength to stomach the scene at the end where the brothers slowly remove all the Nazi propaganda from Danny's bedroom wall in ultra-dramatic fashion. This is an amateurish production of a bad screenplay that didn't think itself through.I didn't believe anything that happened here. Why are all the neo-Nazi punks dressed so impeccably? Shouldn't they be lower-class kids wearing hand-me-downs and thrift store bargains? Maybe there would be a few trust-fund lads around, but the whole crowd of Nazi youth looks like they shop at the Gap and J. Crew. We find out that Derek experienced a trauma in prison, and are expected to believe not only that this event completely changed him, but also that Danny would make an immediate character switch as soon as he hears about Derek's prison experience. I didn't buy it, and why should I? This movie thinks I am stupid enough to believe anything I see without questioning it. And isn't that why we have neo-Nazis to begin with?Don't believe the hype.

His portrayal of Derek Vinyard, a Neo Nazi skinhead was riveting  The journey of a boy with a serious chip on his shoulder to a man who'd do anything necessary to protect his family was most believable.Kudos to Edward Furlong for implementing very necessary aspects of Derek's younger brother, Danny...the angst of many of America's youth, misplaced loyalties, the need for acceptance in the only world he'd ever known, and the hope to follow in a hero's footsteps, his brother.I was on the edge of my seat at the climax, hoping that at the end everything fell into place but knowing that it would be far from a fairy tale ending.This is a wake up call to America, people!",American History X
897,baeri,violence justified,9,16 May 1999,"Much has been said about the amount of violence in the film American History X. I've read comments to the effect that the violence in this film is unnecessary, that we should not be so mesmerized by it, and that a good movie need not show such horror.I have a differing viewpoint on this. Gratuitous violence in a form of entertainment can have an adverse effect on society to a certain degree. The issue I take is with people who say that the violence in this movie and others like it is unnecessary.The real reason that people are afraid of the violence in this movie is because this is a truthful representation of hate. Those who truly hate others for the color of their skin, their religion, or national origin are prone to this type of violence.I live in Pennsylvania. This state has the second highest number of hate groups in the country. I have seen the damage that hate has done to people, the violence that is done against those who are different. This film is an accurate representation of that violence.The movie also flawlessly points out that this hatred of those who are different does not lie with one particular race of people. The ending, which many have complained is not surprising enough for them, shows the vicious circle that mindless hate can cause. Hate is a learned thing, whether it is white people hating black because parents have handed that down over generations, or black people hating white for trying to keep them down. No one is inherently better than anyone else: it's time we learned that.The only other thing I have to say about this film is to praise the impeccable performance of Edward Norton as the young man who learns that hate kills the hard way. I fully agree with critics who the week before the Academy Awards stated that Edward Norton would not win only because of his age and inexperience on the Hollywood scene. His portrayal of the teenager who falls into hate and the young man who is hauled out of it by circumstances is superb, and if he had had even one prior nomination, I believe that he would have won the Oscar.",American History X
898,Arild-4,Great deep-reaching movie about hate,9,10 September 1999,"American History X hits America and its wide, problematic racism right on its present spot. Many racism-related films make you hate hatred. This film rather wants to get to the bottom of it, making a statement of what need to be done.It doesn't just show racist people, in this case neo-nazis, as frustrated, lonely people reaching out to whomever willingly to accept them. The main character, played convincingly by Edward Norton, is an intelligent orator and charismatic leader, who let his black side explain the problems of society, and act accordingly.Hate is shown from both sides. Good reasons for hate are presented. At the same time the narrowsighted aspect of it carefully comes to light, making you see that hate blinds your good judgement. Making you reject there is a flip side to the matter. If you see beyond the entertaining value of this film (which is great), it might actually grab you, wanting you to help those who hate.This movie also makes a huge point of the effect trusted persons arguments have on others. Fathers, be aware of what you tell your children!",American History X

I really liked this movie, and thought it was intense and powerful. Violent too, yes, but always in a realistic way. The cinematography is especially stunning.

902,SJCAMike,"Moving and Thought Provoking, Harshly Realistic",9,6 December 1998,"I saw American History X last night, and I enjoyed it very much.  The story is compelling, and the characters are mostly real.The subject matter is both disturbing and thought provoking as we confront the real world struggles of a working class white family and their frustrations as they view their quiet safe neighborhood being overrun by ethnically-based gangs, while the same racial groups are given preference through federally mandated affirmative action programs.  There's a grain of truth in the hate-based movements, which is part of what makes them so dangerous; and angry invective in response does not diffuse it.Edward Norton is vivid and complex in his role of a confused and conflicted teen who expresses his inner turmoil through the vehicle of a neo-nazi white supremist movement.  He succeeds brilliantly in being at once revolting in his rhetoric, frightening in his actions, yet real and reachable and still human.Edward Furlong does an adequate job of portraying Norton's adoring younger brother, through whose eyes the story is told.  But his adoration is so complete that he seems uninvested in his beliefs, and the character falls short of being a real person in the movie, and seems fairly uninteresting. I think Edward Furlong has a lot of potential -- he has a vulnerability that reaches out and makes me want to care about him; but too often he comes off as unemotional, too much like a stereotypical slacking teenager.It was a pleasure to see Avery Brooks (Benjamin Cisco of ST:DS9) in the role of Dr. Bob Sweeney, principal of the high school and the champion of civil rights in the film, who takes a personal interest in the boys and acts as their counselor.Elliot Gould was also outstanding in his role as a liberal teacher at the high school, who has a romantic entanglement with the boys' mother, played by Beverly D'Angelo.Beverly D'Angelo played the role of the mother probably as well as could be expected, but I was disappointed with the depth of character exploration they afforded her.I won't spoil the end for you, but I found it to be a little dissatisfying: ironic and realistic, perhaps, but not particularly helpful to the discussion.",American History X

The Academy was afraid to accolade American History X because it dealt HONESTLY with the issue of racism.There is one feeling that addicts us to movies, and the theater for that matter; it is that poignance that places us in an almost euphoric trance where we appreciate the and feel the movie more after we have seen it than during seeing it. The movie lingers in our thoughts for a few days after seeing it. We are addicted to this feeling. It is a drug for the human soul. I can offer no  better movie to evoke this drug than ""American History X"". See it.",American History X

906,dumas-2,"Good idea, sadly gone wrong",5,5 March 2001,"I wanted this film to be good.  I wanted it to be what it looked like--a stirring, difficult to watch, challenging portrayal of racism in modern America.  It just missed too many boats to do that. But in fairness, I'll talk about it's good points first.  The basic premise is great, a truly remarkable way to address American racism.  Focus on one town and more specifically one family...really good (I'd like to refer you to the TNT movie ""Freedom Song"" as a film that more successfully deals with racism by looking at one town deeply rather than the whole country shallowly).  Some really good acting from Norton and Furlong, also D'Angelo. Also succeeds in being, if nothing else, shocking.  The EVENTS of the film, in a synopsis, are genuinely moving, and I think a really good film could have been made out of such a premise.Unfortunately, the quality of a movie is not just based on subject matter.The flaws are far more numerous and deadly. The script was really dull, only one good line, and lots of really hollow scenes.  The exposition towards the beginning is artless--police reports and news footage to give us character backgrounds?  That may not sound so terrible, but it really stood out to me as insultingly trite. Also takes too long at the beginning to get started.  We spend over an hour wondering what it was that finally converted Norton and the answer is underwhelming.  I was trying to decide if it would be sudden epiphany or gradual coming to understand.  The answer?  It's neither.  The black guy he works with in the prison cracks some jokes, Norton finds himself laughing, and bang, all his racism gone.  Right.  Ditto Furlong's character.  The movie takes less than 24 hours (not counting flashbacks), and in that time Furlong goes from being a Hitler-in-training to the most understanding fellow around.  How?  His brother (Norton) tells the story of how the black guy he worked with in prison, etc., etc.  Sorry, I needed more of a struggle there, then I'd see his newfound tolerant convictions as being stronger. Many of the characters, as other people note, are one-dimensional, most unfortunately the main secondary character, Furlong's teacher who talks Norton through his conversion.  This fault ties in with a much bigger one. It seems like everyone in the town is concerned primarily with racism. Obviously, it's a movie about racism, but when the only two cliques in the prison were black guys and neo-Nazis, it felt too contrived.Sorry, like I said, good idea, poor execution.  A shame, it could have been good.",American History X
907,Cézé,Processes or equalization?,8,7 May 1999,"Although I think that American History X was one of the best films in year 1998 I had to observe several points. The most important was that I could not feel -because of the flashbacks- the deepness of the film's message as the storyline was broken. This made also impossible to illustrate the process of Derek's arriving to the final point. This part was rather told superficially and in the end we only got a spoon-fed but still neutral conclusion. (The father's conservatism could led to the children's tendency - but quite interesting that the daughter, Davina does not becomes affected..) In spite of this - unfortunately determinated - problem of flash-backing the film represented the most natural and most beautiful flash-backing technique I've ever seen. Splendid idea the way as the final point - killing the black man on the pavement - wasn't presented for the first time (Introduction), this brutal and in a way symbolic action could be saved for the deeper part of the film, making it really catarctic without becoming disturbingly effectual-seeking. The other advantage of the technique that Derek could be presented two ways at the same time to avoid presenting him neither as a rat nor as a hero, always equalizing the bad and the good points of his attitude.Even not spoken of the importance of the main problem - Neonazism - of the film, I can advise it to everyone.",American History X

Powerful scenes are abundant in this movie. There is one scene that I will remember forever (if you've seen it, you'll know which one it was). The scenes could have still been fairly powerful with average actors, but the entire cast was exemplary. Edward Norton's acting was perfect, as was Ed Furlong's. Beverly DeAngelo was surprisingly good; a quantum leap from her other movies. American History X is a very strong movie. It rams home its point much like Saving Private Ryan did. In SPR, you understood fully why war was stupid. In AHX, you understood exactly why racism and nazism are stupid. Definitely one of my all-time favourites.",American History X
910,wildiris,"Flaws and merits, but more merits",8,10 April 1999,"In the eventual final cut that emerged from the celebrated editorial disputes, flaws and merits struggle for supremacy but the merits, I think, win over. On the down side, the treatment of Derek's ideological metamorphosis is a tad superficial (though understandably presented), and Tony Kaye's arty camerawork is sometimes used to overblown effect, as is the otherwise beautiful score. On the up side, there are fine individual scenes and excellent performances, and when the visuals do work they can be stunning - there can't be many films in which the opening credits themselves are a work of art. AHX is not perfect but it is affecting and more special than the typical multiplex movie-by-numbers. In a way, its flaws themselves could be seen to reflect its attempt to do something darker and original and not stick to safe guidelines.",American History X
911,Nitzer-3,The voice of experience...,10,22 April 1999,"In a great majority of the comments I have read, American History X has been described as a 'typical' Hollywood movie. People seem to think that it was just another vehicle for gratuitous sex and violence. Unfortunately the point of it was lost on them. As a former Neo-Nazi, I can vouch for the gratuitous sex and violence...we were not the type to sit around in coffee shops and rationally discuss our 'problems' with non-caucasian people. Non-whites, to the Neo-Nazi, aren't deserving of time and patience (or politeness).American History X really struck a chord, a very painful chord, in the way that it explained the behavior and beliefs of the average Neo-Nazi. Neo-Nazi's are a 'family' of sorts and will not be changed by 'rational' ideas. American History X took a subject that is generally taboo and turned it into a movie about the truth. It didn't display all Neo-Nazi's as ignorant and it didn't display all African-American's as violent, drug-abusing gang-bangers. This movie brilliantly captured reality. The cinematography wasn't perfect, neither was the plot. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that it made its point effectively. The point wasn't that racism is there and that racists are bad. The point was more along the lines of: There is a problem. We have to do look closer than we have been to solve it. Otherwise, nothing will change and racism will get worse, not better!The principal was an extraordinary example of an African-American man who has risen above the racism and hate to the point that he entered a jail to comfort, albeit not for that sole purpose, Derek (the main character / Neo-Nazi), who had been raped by fellow Neo-Nazis in prison.American History X went further than that. It showed that even someone like Derek, who believed so strongly in his races (white) superiority, can change. It showed that not all people are 'lost causes'. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a 'feel-good' movie, people died and a great deal of pain was evident.This movie is excellent and a must see for anyone who wants to take a peek at the real world of Neo-Nazis and their violent (and all-too-often short) lives. This movie was, to me, like looking in a mirror and straight through to my past. American History X can be an eye-opener for anyone willing to look and learn without prejudice and bias and without PRIDE!To quote an old friend, and former Neo-Nazi:""There is nothing more dangerous in this world than the          person who sees everything and learns nothing.""American History X: A 10 out of 10.",American History X

I would not recommend this to the dispassionate movie goer who would rather experience robots, spaceships, and the obligatory hero-villain/beautiful woman/ little kid scenario where the roller coaster eventually stops in ""and they lived happily after"" land! This may be too graphic for the weak at heart, and the all consuming hate current that runs through the soul of this saga may even be totally unbelievable to the naive among us, but what this powerhouse exposes is the true nature of the beast that runs rampant while most of us choose to turn deaf ears and blind eyes! Pretty loud alarms sound about every 5 or 10 minutes in this movie, and Ed Norton should be heralded as the most capable actor of the 90's. I really didn't see any ""slouch"" in this movie, and it had a deep seated uneasy effect on me for days, which to me made it an even more powerful viewing experience than the immediate aftershock.

915,Crit eye,There is only one thing that irked me in the film.,8,29 September 1999,"I have watched American History X and I loved every second of it. It vividly portrays how blindly cruel humanity can become. The important thing one must keep in mind  is that both Derek and Danny had the right to feel bitter the way they felt. Derek learnt his lesson thanks to his mentor ( who is ironically coloured ) in prison. Derek, being the eldest in the family has a deep impact on his younger brother Danny, who is in turn ignorant of his brother's change in opinion. I find that Derek's role in the film is to patch up the aftermath of his initial neo-nazis way of life  ... retribution and the killing of the inferior race. The scene where he looks at himself in the mirror seeing the swastica and feeling incapable of erasing it besides being most impressive, hints at his futile fight to erase the effects he had on Danny.  One could say,  Danny changed in the end. In the film, it is the mentor phrase that predominates ... stop the vengeance and the killing to have them stopped being done to you.There is only one thing that irked me in the film. It is the fact that Derek's impression on Danny took whole years to be implanted and grow ... how on earth did these be eradicated overnight ?",American History X
916,JackSlims,"With a closed mind, there is no other perspective than one's own.",8,7 January 2000,"Narisicism is ingrained in human nature.  People's love for themselves often leads them to bond with others who are most similar with them.  This lack of diversity of thought lends members of such a group to believe that their paradigm is the true or correct way to view the world.  American History X portrays these feelings excellently.  The neo-Nazis began simply as angry young men who were scared in the world which they lived.  They found solace, and soon ignorance, in the company of fellow men who, in one way or another, held similar feelings. This comfort which grew from the mass quickly bottlenecked its members' ability to empathize.  People with different perspectives were not only ignored but seen as the enemy. narrower and narrower mindset soon set in, eliminating the ""big picture' completely. AMX's use of this theme was magnificent.  I hope that those who see this film enter with an open mind and leave with a heightened sense of the world around them.  Even for those where racial inequality is not a factor in their life, this movie still offers insight.  Ignorance to the feelings of fellow human beings can be found in the smallest of daily activities.  Open your eyes, take a step back, and look at the world from the shoes of another. You'll be surprised at what you see.",American History X

Cause the way the director filmed it was already great. And when the movie carried on it was getting better and better and slowly the message of the movie because more clear. And changes the total perspective of this movie.Edward Norton, one of the best new actors since years, played like he was doing this for years, he's a natural. I've seen him before in ""Primal Fear"", were he stole the show from Richard Gere. The same counts for the ""People vs. Larry Flint"" In both movies and in this movies he plays every time again a totally different part and has got many faces.This movie is so much better than most of the movie's cause of the great story and perfect screenplay.The great shots are so real that you really believe it happens like that in real life. Tony Kaye did a perfect job for his first movie he ever produced. If this is his first movie I can't wait to see his next one.Edward Furlong who plays the brother of Dereck (Norton)made a few bad movies but in this movie he proves himself as a great actor with a lot of skills.I can say only one thing about the movie: If you haven't seen this one then you have to see him tomorrow",American History X

931,daggerboy34,A beautiful film with a powerful message behind it,9,24 December 2007,"I remember I saw this on the history channel once. I have to say it was great. This film kept me interested the whole time that i couldn't even leave for th bathroom (exept for commercials). Edward Norton did a great job playing Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead preventing his brother going down the wrong path he did. The acting is just perfect when characters express their emotions through rage, humor and depression. Many people say the message of this film is that racism is bad, but there is more to it. The message being (from my point of view) is that many of us are role models for other people or some us have role models and it's the role models' responsibility to be a good one. In this case, Derek was a bad one and Danny followed down in his footsteps. So if you are interested in good acting, powerful messages getting across to you, i recommend this movie.",American History X
932,tredotcom,American History !,9,30 July 2020,"American History X is a very powerful film with messages about hate and racism. We see how hatred never solves problems and violence only attracts more violence. In this film, you will see amazing acting from Edward Norton. You learn that being mad at things you can't control doesn't solve any problems. Hate is something that is taught to and engraved into the minds of kids that will believe that racism is the answer to the problems of the world.
Overall, this movie is a gem, it will stick with you and may change your perspective on the world and how you think and are as a person. I highly recommend you watch this because you will leave with lessons learned.",American History X

I say this because the movie brings out the changing attitude of the human nature towards another human/animal. And best of all this change is so quickly done that it just is amazing. This movie according to me has a perfect pace,for its nature with all the characters in its place. The two brothers having to fight the background that they come from and for Derek to realize,during his jail time that a human being is not judged by his color but by his soul which is colorless. This is actually according to me a lesson in itself to all of us. All in all this movie moved me and thats why i say its one of the best movies.",American History X
935,dverdejo,A Must See For All...,9,27 November 2001,"Edward Norton plays an absoulutely realistic and profound character as Derek Vinyard. Derek is a strong willed, intelligent and very pro-active character with a mixed up view on the realities of racism (Neo-nazi), primarily due to the deficiencies in the American system. As a result of brutally killing two afro-american youths who attempted to steal his car, Derek faces imprisonment. While in prison he experiences a different perspective which serves as a rude awakening to his wrongful hatred. This is a very strong and meaningful movie as it deals directly with the issues of hatred which are so very real in our society today. The director deals with the issue without judging between black and white, which makes this film a MUST SEE FOR ALL. Great acting jobs by the entire cast, particularly Edward Norton, who looks much fitter in this movie than in the Fight Club.",American History X

However,the film's greatest draw must be the astonishing Edward Norton,disgracefully passed over at the Oscars, who turns in a remarkable performance as Neo-Nazi hate-monger Derek Vinyard.Norton transforms the film from a good rent to an essential view,seamlessly portraying his almost duel-performance of Vinyard before and after his reform from racial hated,entirely convincingly.The film is far more than a stream of shocking (and they are shocking) set-pieces, and the violence, brutal as it may be,is never glamourised.The film's harrowing conclusion is the icing on the cake, ensuring that this is a tale that will stay with you long after the video is back in the box.All in all, a very good movie, if not one for the faint of heart!",American History X

Every time you watch the movie you take the same taste as the first time maybe even better. The first scene starts with a man making love with his girlfriend that makes you shocked at the first minutes but then the story takes you to a terrible prison, neo-nazi people defending the racialism so hardly, a family so close to fall into pieces and so on. The players are chosen very carefully and I think Norton fits to his character very very much. The friendship between Derek and the laundry man Lamont is so similar to the one between Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding in Shawshank Redemption movie. This is a movie that everyone must put in his archives.",American History X

American History X is by far Norton's best work.In History X he plays Derek a leader of a neo Nazi gang of skinheads in Venice Beach, California. After Killing two black guys for trying to steal his car he is sent down for manslaughter. While in prison he is made to work with a black man, at first he resents the man but as the film goes on he becomes really good friends with him. Also while in prison he meets another group of Nazi's who he befriends. When he see that the men in this gang are not as dedicated to white power has him he leaves them and starts playing basketball with the black cons. With this bring hatred from the nazi gang and something terrible happens. This helps to reform him and change him from a Nazi to a respectable member of society. On his release he realises that his little brother Danny (Edward Furlong, Terminator 2) has followed in the same footsteps has him. Is there enough time to rescue Danny before something bad happens?American History X is not biased to any race it just tells the story of a neo nazi's reform. It has some really good arguments for both races.Buy this and you'll be hooked not just by how different Norton is from Fight Club but by the acting and story. 10/10",American History X
942,jhambrock444,Emotionally Gripping Drama About Life and Family,8,23 July 2002,"When we see someone we love become something we hate, it tears us apart. Such situations can destroy families, such situations can bring families together. In this film, one family is put under enormously serious situations in which how much they can endure will prove how strong they really are.On a fateful summer night in California, Derrek Vinyard  (Edward Norton), hears the noise of glass shattering. He looks out the window to see a few men trying to break open his car. Although we do not know it, this series of events will labeled as a race crime. The men in our eyes are black. The men in Derrek's eyes are not men, they are creatures tearing apart our economy, our American foundation, and our neighborhood. In a violent and excessive way, Derrek defends his family. The end result is the death of 2 African American men.Derrek is sentenced to 3 years in prison for Defensive Manslaughter. While it may seem that Derrek is the main focus of this story, the person most affected by this is his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong). Like almost any younger brother, Danny admires Derrek. Danny recognizes what Derrek did. Danny sees that nearly a hundred other people like his brother worshipped him. Danny is not blind. He sees that the impact Derrek had on their community was so astounding that it is only in Danny's responsibility to carry on that tradition.In an amazing realistic and true-to-life story written by David McKenna, we watch and take in every event which happens in Derrek's life after that fateful night. We watch the transformation of characters, the metamorphosis of the Vinyard family over the course of 3 years, and even a few before that.After seeing this film, you don't think about the pervasive violence and language, you don't think about the graphic content and often disturbing realism involved, you are left with a mindset which leaves you in a twist. You know some of these things that happen are wrong, but why do you agree with them in some points? What makes these characters tick? Why does this happen? When you ask yourself theses questions, you know you have seen a work of art.Brilliantly and beautifully filmed and directed by Tony Kaye, he pulls us into this world which is so similar to what we live in today. We become so involved with the characters, that in the final act, we are left with a feeling of confusion and sorrow.This film is surly to be labeled as controversial for all times, but should be more remembered for its message, especially in this time of our world.",American History X

I can't begin to describe how awesome this movie is, I was so drawn in and the ending (which I'm not going to spoil)made me teary.Most of the movie is in black and white because it's mostly Derek (Norton) and Danny (Furlong) remembering the past. The movie also shows us Derek's unfair racism hate towards black people and immigrants, and a good portion of the movie shows us his time in prison and the key as to why he survived (He was surrounded by black people and such) Anyhow, the rest of the movie is about Derek trying to make sure his brother Danny doesn't end up like him.Overall, it's a amazing movie. I definitely recommend it.",American History X

Once out, he realises how quickly in number his old gang of nazi thugs has grown and wonders if he can save his brother.This is a brilliant film. Perhaps what disturbs me the most is the way that Edward Norton looks so brutal, yet sounds so intellectual throughout the film.Although the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension. Neither black nor white people are ""judged"" in the film, it's primary focus being to outline that it's people's brutality that causes a racial divide, not race itself.",American History X

They sincerely think that it is the American black people which are deteriorating the American exchequer. Govt. is doing every single thing for them. And thus in the rebuke they carry on the skin head tradition. And thus equally participating with the blacks to make America.... not a good place to live. This movie rotates about one family and tells their story when protagonist moves to jail(before and after), the changes that term brought into the protagonist.

953,rehan-yunus,"Derek is a charismatic, intelligent, articulate young man who has just got out off prison and finds out that his younger brother is following in his footsteps.",9,18 January 2008,"American History X pokes at the belief of white supremacists and political correctness in America. Tony Kaye punches you in the face with his fierce dialogue and cinematography, supported by a masterful performance by Edward Norton, the reformed and remorseful Neo-Nazi protégé. It reinforces the current standing that clever racists can profoundly exploit those that have no direction in life and nowhere to channel their anger. Even with its verbal and physical brutality, it is a film that should be watched to see these extreme issues and how things could end up if we let poverty, racism and political correctness feed of each other. It is shame that Tony Kaye has not directed many other films.Edward Norton is a talented actor as he possesses an ability to morph into many different characters (The Narrator, Fight Club) (Monty Brogan, 25th Hour) (Eisenheim, The Illusionist), providing he has the artistic room to breathe. Tony Kaye utilisation of Norton's flexibility has made this one of 1998's poignant yet underrated films.There were a few scenes in the film that gave the impression of the unnecessary purity of racist violence. Triumphant music scores as the white supremacist battle with their darker counterparts and almost 'Jesus-like' holiness during Derek's revengeful murders were overcooked. Although the sole piece of the film revolves around Derek, his actions and consequences, it doesn't explain his family's staunch views against Racism. With all the family difficulties, financially and spiritually, the film does not explain their moral convictions and the importance of education as shown by Derek's sister's devotion to education. There was also the over simplification of why Derek was going to be dormant racist in the making due to his father views. It would have nice to see a little bit more of Murray (Elliot Gould) and Sweeney (Avery Brooks) interact with Derek and how there lives were affected by his persona. Finally, the deleted scenes should have been added to the film as I felt added weight and understanding.Even though this film is several year old as I write this, it is still provoking today as it was in 1998.

The great composition and amazing acting and meaning to this movie set it apart from so many others. Edward Norton showed in this movie as he had before and has after and still is today that he is an amazing and diverse actor, and has a moving performance, which i was not surprised at, at all. Edward Furlong on the other hand, i could not have imagined would have played his very important part as well as he did. I don't think any person of the stature and age for that role at the time could have done better than he did. This movie showed so well the real life issue of hate towards each other. Blacks hate for whites. Whites hate for blacks through very really movements like the Neo-Nazi movement.

Likewise Edward Furlong played his role quite well, they make a great on screen duo, Furlong should star in more movies like this, it allows him to bring back that rebellious terminator 2 boyhood charm - which can only be done by him.This movie is an integral part of my DVD collection.

Derek is a white supremacist and is a huge role model for Danny, his younger brother; however, his violent and hateful lifestyle leads to him taking jail time. Throughout the course of the stay, he is reformed and leaves prison hoping to stop his brother from going down the same road as he did.This film would be half as good as it was, if not for the actors. Both Edward Norton and Edward Furlong portray their characters powerfully and effectively, and the audience can truly step into their shoes.

Wonderfully shot, this is one of the most powerful modern movies I've seen, I even enjoyed the cliché use of black and white for past events - it really works in the film.I cannot recommend it enough, it's a movie about life, and hate, and though it deals mainly with racism in American culture it also has words to say about prison culture and family.  Although some may be put off by the violence or the language, this is one of those special-case movies where you've got to look past it and watch 'the film' not just the actions.If you had the chance to see this movie and didn't (like me) I urge you to see it as soon as you can.

It shows how youths are easily corrupted with superb performances from Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and even Stacy Keach. It also sends a message that there is no real point in racism and persecuting ethnic groups. Norton shows his hate for African Americans very well as well as his reform. The only major flaw that I could see is the somewhat illogical radical change of Norton's attitude toward minorities in prison.

963,abfacebookab,Very good movie? yes. Instant classic? no.,7,15 February 2011,"This is a response to some negative reviews. Some people were wondering how Derek, a supposedly smart kid was influenced only by his dad's one remark. Though the movie did not explicitly say this, I believe it is after his father died that he met Cameron, who became a father figure to Derek, and with his constant propaganda began to change Derek's mind and overwhelm the opinions of his family. Another question is why the African-American kid kills Danny at the end for seemingly nothing but blowing smoke in his face. Again it is implied that this is not their first interaction, and with Danny's opinions probably made very public, there was probably growing tensions between them, that with the smoke just put him over the edge, not to mention the African-American kid was also in a gang that was probably fighting with the white supremacist group Danny and Derek were a part of. This gang was also probably responsible for trying to kill Cameron and Seth at the end. Also, the ""change of heart"" that Derek had did not take place in 2 days like some reviewers are saying. Remember that Derek saw dealings he didn't like between his group and the minority groups in prison, this lead to tensions between him and the group which lead to him being raped in the shower. This combined with the growing relationship between him and the African-American he was working with and Sweeney's guidance were all factors in changing his attitude. Remember this was based on a true story so these events are not all bullshit. I do agree that some of the editing and stylistic choices weren't the best (ie the slow motion and could have explained things more clearly with more scenes).

This violent, powerful film shocked many audiences with its brutal truth of white supremacy groups in America.The story is told brilliantly and keeps you feeling very unsettled throughout. The film often showed flashbacks revealing truths about main character Derek's past and how he ended up in prison. The flashbacks are shown in black and white, which I think works very well as it emphasises the darkness of his past. The film deals with some very violent shocking scenes that possibly aren't suitable for small children or in fact some adults.

Norton puts in a powerful performance, that at times has you almost wondering if he is actually fighting a just cause. The film itself is rather slow paced, but for the better I would say. This film isn't for the Van Diesel generation, this film is for those of us who like substance, meaning and good acting in our films.They storytelling is wonderful, with a dual perspective on some scenes seen from the point of view from Edward Furlong (who plays the younger brother) as he idolises his Brother (Edward Norton).The film itself follows Derek (Edward Norton)and his brother(Edward Furlong) through the problems they've had with racism and the blacks that have 'infested' there local area (and eventually killed there father), which causes Derek to join a cell against Blacks. The film however isn't one sided at all, in fact it shows both sides equally, and the climax of the film is tragic after all that Derek has tried throughout the film.It's unfair however to place all of the credit on Edward Norton, as Edward Furlong also plays a fantastic role as Norton's younger brother, who Norton tries to save and reform. In fairness the whole cast, while it may not be 'Mainstream' is fantastic and everyone puts in a powerful and truely believable performance.This film will make you think, it will make you grimach ""bite the curb"".

I've always admire him as an actor and this movie is no exception. He plays the brother who returning from prison he finds that his little brother is following on his footsteps by joining a Neo-Nazi organization. The movie goes back and forth between the older brother's life before going to prison and his life after he gets out. The acting is impeccable and the story very good and the message timeless(especially with the current situation all over Europe). No doubt one of the highlights of the 90s' movie era and one of the best movies of Edward Norton (along with Fight Club and Primal Fear).Intense scenes but very realistic considering the issues it circles while the finale is one of the best I have seen.,American History X
968,ticktop,One of the most over rated movie!,1,27 November 2003,Can't believe this movie was rated higher than Braveheart! This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen! The movie scenes were so contrived. And the movie was so boring it put me asleep. One of the most over rated movie of all time.,American History X
969,amahdramsey,Powerful film,8,4 August 2017,"I was looking forward to see this film as I missed it at the cinema and am a firm believer that Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is always worth seeing (even if some of his films have given less than he deserves). It was maybe better that I only saw it recently as I was able to enjoy it without all the hype and fighting over who did what to who, or all the comments from director Kaye as to his opinions of the film. Having seen the pompous fool interviewed several times, I find it quite self assuring that I don't agree with his opinions of it!The plot is a mix of flashback into Derek's hate filled past (told in b&w) and the present (colour) where he is desperate to save his brother and family from suffering anymore from his 'sins'. As a basic narrative the film struggles at times to make a solid story and seems to be trying too hard to create confrontations to up the drama within the film. It still works mind you but this is not it's best asset.The main thing the film does well is to be a very true representation of white male disillusionment. The film avoids painting these people as monsters straightaway (although makes no bones that they are confused, misled and wrong). The arguments and discussions they have in the film are not so far from reality that the characters seem fiction – the characters and the film's world seem very real. The film's message that hate is no way to live no matter who it is directed at may be a little simplistic but it is a valid point. One particular weakness which I felt was a little hamfisted was Derek's 'road to Damascus' experience in prison – it was OK but was far too easy given the character we had just seen brutally kill several black men.The other main selling point the film has is a performance by Norton that simply ensures he steals nearly every scene he is in. In b&w flashback he is at his best – a larger than life character who is never allowed to just be seen as a thug. Norton acts out the various stages of his life well and makeup ensures that he looks younger when required. In the present he is less dominant but still is very good giving a different performance. Furlong is also very strong, although he only has a few scenes where he is able to be outside of Norton's shadow. Support from Balk, Gould, D'Angelo and Brooks is mixed – Gould's Jewish character is only in the film to allow for one scene to occur, while Brooks' righteous teacher is simply a 'morally upright teacher' with no meat on his character.",American History X

972,howrie,One of the greatest movies ever,10,15 October 2004,"WARNING SPOILER'S AHEAD: This movie has everything that a good movie needs. It has great acting from actors such as Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. It has a great storyline and the end is good, sad but good.During the movie you see how someone can really change their own life. At the start of the movie Derek Vinyard is a skinhead leader of a white power movement. At the end he is no longer a man filled with hate, he becomes a man full of love for his family. Derek also pays the ultimate price for what he used to do with the death of Danny who is his brother who loves him to death.American History X is brilliant with the bits in Black and White, this is a great symbol because when Derek was a skinhead for him it was just white people against black people. But when its in color he sees everyone as equal.The end of the movie is very sad and emotional, when Danny gets shot and Derek comes running in and starts crying it is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen. The way that he would loved his brother was so great and he knows that it Danny's death could be blamed on him.How Edward Norton didn't get nominated for an Oscar proves that the Oscar Commitie Board vote for people in politically correct movies. Edward is great in it and the movie is rated 10/10.",American History X

The transformation from bad guy to good guy is amazing, and I'm pretty sure based on many people's real life events.The younger Edward (who plays Norton's younger brother in the film) plays an excellent 2nd fiddle to Norton, and the performances from both are really touching.Without giving the ending away, I felt as though something like that was always going to happen.

I have heard of the KKK and stuff, but never about anything related to Neo-Nazi skin heads in the news. Does anybody have any replies or have heard of something similar happening in their area or abroad? Oh, if any of you liked this movie, I strongly recommend the new South African movie, 'Red Dust'.

Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) used to be the kind of man that could be described in no other words than ""racist"" and the shadow of Hitler. And only after he lived his days in prison, did he realize how wrong he was about everything. When he was freed, he left that life...but that life continued around him. His little brother, Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong), was taught the same things he was taught, but Derek didn't want it that way. He told his brother of what happened on those many days in prison, how he became friends with an Af/Am and was beaten up by a gang of Caucasians because of it. Soon their family sort of ""patched up"" and was like new again....until a twisted ending.I loved this movie. Not only was it moving and dramatic, but also because of how great and talented all of the actors were. I've never thought so much of how we should appreciate the fact that we're all different. I couldn't believe that human-kind could be so hurtful to other people, our brother and sisters. The ending (which I won't speak of) was completely surprising. I gave it a 10 because of the lesson it taught me and the lesson it could teach others.",American History X
976,AlexCartney14,A true film making masterpiece.,10,24 May 2006,"A truly brilliant piece of film making, it is seen through the eyes of Danny who's brother, Derek got 3 years in prison for the murder of three black car jackers, Derek was a neo-Nazi skinhead, you see his time in prison in a series of flashback style shots, when Derek gets out of jail he is a changed man, he has left behind his racist past, but when he gets out of jail he finds that Danny has gone down the same evil, racist road that he had. It all happens over a 24 hour period as Derek tries desperately to save his brother from the same hate fuelled bigotry that consumed his life and got him jailed, you find that it was the friendship of a black inmate that made Derek change his views. He manages to change his brothers views but is it too late to protect Danny from his earlier mistakes? There are fantastic performances from both Norton and Furlong and I would find it almost impossible to not give this film 10 out of 10. The film is a compelling tribute to the unrelenting human spirit and its ability to overcome the intolerable. Like Danny did in the film i will end this review with a couple of quotes that i think fit well with this film: 'those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities', 'The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil but because of those who look on and do nothing.'

977,martinjrigby,Powerful and evocative,9,15 November 2004,"Edward Norton delivers a career defining performance as the neo-nazi frontman, Derek Vinyard. This film is outstanding from start to finish. The acting is truly remarkable. First rate performances from the whole cast instigate a real sense of feeling and empathy for the characters (even those with extreme views!). The plot is gripping and thought provoking. The moral and racial issues raised in this powerful drama are evocative and at times controversial. The movie toils with your emotions at every turn, with feelings and opinions flipping from one extreme to another. A powerful and emotional masterpiece.9/10",American History X
978,KSqueaker,The best movie I've seen in a while,10,14 August 2005,"American History X is a very important movie. It delivers its point (the effects and seeds of racism in middle-class America) unabashedly. At points the film is grotesque (I won't say what, but I was trying to tell a friend about one scene and I couldn't even say it, it was so disturbing!!!) and sickening. Even just the mindset of Derek (played MASTERFULLY by Edward Norton) at certain points in the movie was horrifying. However, racism itself is a horrifying, electric issue that should not be handled lightly. A movie to compare American History X with is Crash, which tackles the issue of racism, but with a lot less subtlety and sincerity. And though it bears an R rating, the film feels so restrained, like the actors made it just to have something activist-ish on their resumes. American History X, however, shies away from no subject, and in its honesty delivers an uplifting message and a dire warning. The script and cinematography are excellent, but what stands out most is Edward Norton's performance. He is my favorite actor (and I don't take that title lightly), and gives a good reason why in American History X. Such complex, wildly different emotions (his apparent satisfaction killing some black men who were attempting to steal his car, his turnaround, guilt, and utterly moving explosion of grief at the end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall, an incredible movie.",American History X
979,tiffanyox34,amazing.,10,6 February 2005,"let me first start off by saying this was probably the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life. it shows the feelings that real people have inside. It shows why people hate different kinds of people... even thought people say that all white supremacists were stupid and ignorant they may be ignorant to some things but most aren't stupid. take a look at derek, he had more to say at that dinner table [ when his mother had a man over ] then probably anyone I've ever seen. He showed more intelligence then anyone expected him to show... the fact that he learned from his mistakes showed that he was a much stronger person then any of his old friends. Also when he was in jail he befriended an African American only because he saw that the other white supremacist in the jail didn't care what color people were they sold drugs with people from another race and hurt people of their own color, so he saw that it didn't really matter what color you are just if you help them .. he knew it was all a fake and a lie, and he knew he had to get out of it for his life and the life of his family... basically saying, this movie was amazing and I'm very proud that it was made because if it wasn't then maybe people wouldn't know what they know that. people don't hate color, they hate themselves.",American History X
980,winstonwardell,this film is all Reich with me.,10,9 October 2013,"without a doubt this film is the most emotionally moving film I've ever seen. The fact that Edward Norton did not win the Oscar for best actor only validates the bias nature of the Oscars and it loses credibility.Edward Norton shows a man with very strong opinions and how they are manipulated and form into this dark evil monster that he has to battle alone. Derek is character who does something very difficult even a morally sane person would struggle with, not just doubt his beliefs but confront them face on. we see this pure evil manifest into something even worse and yet he is able to gain perspective in jail. now this film hardly paints jail as a nice, lovely place were people go to find there moral compass but rather tries to show it as I suspect it really is; a crossroads for people to either gain perspective or continue to be blinded by there own ignorance. The black and white flashbacks symbolic of a world were Derek separated blacks and whites, beautifully depicts the internal conflicts he faced on a day to day basis only to show once he sees the light (represented by the return of colour) he is a different person still facing the same problems but his approach is different this is paramount and the anchor of the storyline. every character faces a crossroad but its only till perspective is gained will they emerge from this haze of ignorance and stupidity. this film is so down to earth it plummets to the core of the world it is illustrating and faces the monster that has left a trail of destruction, negatively influenced loved ones and physically harmed others, it does not wrap a pretty ribbon around it just makes you feel something and much like the characters in the film, leaves the audience with perspective and how racism manifests and who it affects.",American History X
981,TheVillageRogue,"A Brilliant Piece of Work, With an Often Misunderstood Ending",10,22 April 2005,"Edward Norton shines in his role of Derek Vinyard in AHX, which is the bluntest, most realistic portrayal of racism in the world that Hollywood has ever produced. The movie is one of an evolution in philosophy, of courage and standing up for what is right. Unfortunately, some who see this film come out of it with the impression that it contradicts itself.*Spoilers* In the end, when Danny is shot by the black student who he confronted in the opening scene, some people seem to believe that it gives the impression that it makes a villain out of the black student and destroys the lesson the film tries to preach. However what some fail to realize is that the film is about racism, spoken from a white person's perspective, however racism is a problem within all societies and within all races, and as a result everybody loses. Danny lived a life of hatred and lost his life as a result, and his killer, fueled by the same hate, is obviously going to live the majority of his life behind bars as a result. The movie may be about redemption, however the message serves as a warning and tries to keep the audience from living a life similar to the Vinyard brothers before you go too far.All in all, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.

Though by the end it showed a different side and left me more open minded than I was before I watched the film. The movie is based around race and racism and the divide between the two. The film had a shocking ending and changed my whole perspective on the topic. It left me in between which concludes me agreeing with the message it gives across that we shouldn't live our life angry and dependant on a belief because each side is valid and has an opinion just a much as the other.

I found the movie OnDemand, and selected play. From the very first scene to the very end I didn't move. I was amazed. I did not even pause the movie for the whole 110 minutes. This film was brilliant, one of the best out there. Never before in my life had a movie stuck to me like this did. For the next few months, and even today, I am constantly thinking about that movie and the intensity of it.

I recommend this film to everyone who is interested on knowing that the new Nazi movements are not something to take as a joke, that reality is in the streets and this history shows the horrors that this people commit. In my opinion the only failure that it has is that the personality of the small brother is not too much worked. In addition I want to say that the last lines that are read in the film have a message of which all we would have to learn: the life is too short to spend it being always upset.

This film is a roller-coaster of emotion, and an epic drama at its finest. In my opinion, the most important point of American History X is not white supremacy, but the compelling and gripping portrayal of A family unit without a father. Most notably between younger and older brothers (Derek and Daniel), but also between a mother and her two sons. The racist and Nazi tones are simply very strong devices to show these bonds during extreme times.The story is told through current events (filmed in colour) and past events (filmed in black and white), which provide a great contrast in the film. With some very hot direction from Tony Kaye, a good script and a great casting, allows Edward Norton shines. It is one of the greatest performance by a leading actor in a modern film. He Pumps emotion and a real belief into his words, with much conviction that you, the viewer are sucked in and start to believe what he is saying is the truth.For Edward Nortons performance alone (although there is so much more to love about this film) American History X is firmly in my Top 10.",American History X

In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitler's Main leader, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeney's.

There are plenty of uneducated people out there that need to understand how their actions may be wrong. I think that this movie should be taught in school, or at least segments of it. It is a great movie and it will definitely pertain to modern society in 5, 10, 20 years because these issues still haven't stopped.

Neo-Nazism have the elements of a Nazism ideology which are ultra nationalism, racism, able-ism, xenophobia, homophobia, antiziganism, antisemitism, and initiating the Fourth Reich. The film focuses on racism and xenophobia, the white people fears that foreigners(Asian/Latin) who owned businesses will only hire foreigners and it will lead to a higher number of jobless white people. Racism is also one of the film main theme thinking that white people have supremacy over people of colors. American History X excels in story telling, why? because of its black and white and colored scheme every time there is a flashback, which is in black and white format and wherein its story line evolved. The colored one represents the present time. Edward Norton got nominated for this film and I think he really deserves it one of the flawless acting performance I've ever seen, It's shame that the Academy didn't nominate this gem in the Best Picture category I think the reason is its provoking theme and I think the academy is not ready to recognize a Powerful Politically charged film during the 90's",American History X

One neo-Nazi who is so indoctrinated to the point of killing because of his ideology does not simply go to jail, make a black friend and go out as Jesus, that doesn't happen. Extreme dogmatic groups like neo-Nazis do a much better job of washing people's brains. Also this movie doesn't explore the real issues behind the existence of this groups. This movie is a big underestimation of the complexity of this issue and it's clearly meant to be watched by people that already agree with the premise that racism is bad, sadly the movie misses the opportunity to be much more thought provoking and ends up being the equivalent of showing a text that reads ""racism is bad"" for two hours... yeah we know that.CONCLUSION (spoiler-free): This movie is an underestimation of the complexity of the problem of racism and radical hate groups, it's unrealistic and it won't teach you anything new or even entertain you enough to make up for its lack of accurate description of reality. 4/10 not worth it.",American History X

When he comes out he realises what he has done to himself and his family, which includes a superb Edward Furlong of Terminater 2 fame. Told through his eyes the story flashes back to the incidents that lead Dereks incarceration and the impact it has on him. Also featuring excellent performances from Ethan Suplee and Fairuza Balk this film is the cream of the crop. If you haven't seen i suggest you do - quick.

It's a powerful movie, no two ways about it.The people who made this film should be applauded for taking so such a sensitive topic head-on and really taking the matter into their own hands, sending out the message in no uncertain terms that racism is wrong. Terrific acting by Norton and Furlong, and amazing videography. 10 out of 10, no questions about it.",American History X
1003,MRawn15,So powerful I doubt I can watch it again,10,2 February 2007,"Few movies truly deserve to be rated a ten out of ten, but American History X earned it. The film, with no flashy CGI, edgy lighting or editing, feels raw and real. Norton, who I am always a fan of, does one of the best cinematic performances I've ever seen. Every other actor in the film does a fantastic job as well.It's rare for a Hollywood movie to be gritty and poignant, harsh and beautiful at the same time, and this pulls it off perfectly. It is very hard to watch and left me sobbing at the end of it. One of my favorite and most respected movies of all time, but I'm not even sure if I can watch it again.Do yourself a favor and see this incredibly powerful, well-done movie.",American History X

It is shot absolutely perfect that it takes you into the film.Many viewers complain that this film is underrated and are surprised it did not reach such high popularity. I disagree for the fact that, although it is my favourite film, it is too controversial and powerful for the public. I do not deny that this film has influenced racism in me and gives me a hard time because of it. I think it is a great film and I am happy you can find it in a video store but not shining on the display.I think for film lovers this is a great film. For entertainment, maybe not so suitable.",American History X

1006,Kainoknight,"Beautifully shot, well directed, acted, and written",10,1 February 2007,"This is one of the most powerful fascinating movies made. Even though it's independent, you can't really see it.The camera work is great. There are some black and white scenes, but if there was ever a movie to convince you that black and white could be beautiful it's this movie.(Rereading that last sentence I realize it's kind of an ironic statement being the movies material) The black and white scenes are well shot especially the basketball scene. The color scenes are just as breathtaking.The direction tells the story very smoothly, we don't find out what Edward Norton character entirely did to get in prison until about forty five minutes into the movie and when you do you have to decide if he can ever be forgiven. The scene in the party, the costumes, the posters, the way you know people who live this way.I know everybody says this but it's true. Edward Norton IS the man of the hour in this film. Five minutes into his character, Derek Vineyard I said, ""Wait, THATS Edward Norton!"" The small mentally handicapped kid from Primal Fear, the weak looking narrator from Fight Club. Now he looks like a guy if you saw him walking towards you, you would want to walk on the sidewalk on the other side of the street. He gained 30 pounds of muscle for this role and actually looks like a militaristic skin head. Oh yeah, his acting, he never misses a beat, he sounds like he means everything he says and then some. Watching this movie a dumb person might assume he really is the role he plays. Edward Norton is the Marlon Brando of our day. The role itself is well written, but being the character, I'd say less than five percent of Hollywood would have agreed to the role.The writing is quite something. The story feels real and I've heard it was. The only people who hate the dialogue are people who just can't listen to it. The dinner scene had amazing conversations and is actually one of the best scenes of the movie. People say it's the violence that gets to them, I think it's the nature of the writing that makes them uncomfortable, it even makes myself uncomfortable during my first watch. The character Derek Vinyard isn't a simple one, he isn't the ignorant redneck racist we're all used to. He's intelligent capable and has what it takes to be a leader.Even though you've seen racism movies before, it's a mistake too pass this one up. It has plenty to offer, plenty of things you haven't seen or heard before. In the end it's worth it and you are glad you saw it.",American History X

American History really does deserve the awards that titles like those won. The ending of the movie really caught me by surprise, one of the few movies i ever watched that made me gasp when it ended. Liked how the movie went into detail of Dereks hatred in flashbacks, really gave me a feel for the character as the story progressed. I also got to add that while watching this movie i was acully convinced at first that Edward Nortan really was racist. This is a movie worthy of several Oscars.",American History X
1012,Jcombat,Excellent film.,8,2 July 2006,"This has remained one of my favorite movies for years and years now. It has always struck me as a very real-life film that needs no more than a turbulent story and great acting to capture its audience.The first thing that comes to mind in this movie's favor is Edward Norton's performance as Derek Vinyard. Very moving and powerful, and in my eyes the best performance of his career thus far. Edward Furlong's performance as Derek's little brother I felt was good, but not too exceptional. A few of his scenes just didn't sit right with me, maybe because of his age. All the other crucial roles I thought were superb.A powerful ending is what I think really seals the deal on any great film, and this film definitely delivers. The ending is somewhat of a surprise, and a very drastic change in mood for the viewer.All-in-all, the film has a great flow; easy to understand and very emotional. Why I gave it an 8 is probably due to watch ability. It's not a movie I'd sit and watch over and over, but more of one that I'd watch and leave on the shelf for a while. For Tony Kaye's first movie, forget about it. Definitely looking forward to more from this guy.",American History X

But, in reading some of the comments here, I wonder if I saw the same one.Yes, Ed Norton was superb and was deserving of his nomination. But I felt like maybe 1/2 of this flick was missing. Why didn't they delve a little deeper into his friendship in prison? Why was his separation from the skinheads so anticlimactic? It appeared there would be consequences for leaving Cameron for dead, but nothing came of it. Unfortunately, there are more loose ends.I guess I now understand why Tony Kaye was so upset that he didn't get to edit this film - they turned what could've been a classic into a pretty good movie.",American History X

Coming out of this movie I felt more emotionally drained than any other movie I can remember(Even more than after seeing Saving Private Ryan). One thing is for sure in my eyes, Tom Hanks will not be winning his third Oscar this year due to the exquisite performance by Edward Norton. If anyone enjoyed Norton in Primal Fear then watch out, because his performance in American History X is even better.

Not much is made up unfortunately... .the scenes from the Market, and even when Derek smashes the neck as ""the nigger"" has his teeth on the curb.

My fear is that the press from the director will scare people away. The irony is that scaring people away from ""American History X"" would be as much a crime as scaring people away from ""Saving Private Ryan"". AHX isn't a perfect movie; there are a couple minor disconnects in the plot.

Edward Furlong does a good job as well, as the misguided younger brother of Edward Norton. For the film's sake, and for the message it tells, do not miss this movie.",American History X

1031,Viccers,An analytical perspective on American History X,10,6 August 1999,"One knows America is problematic when one of its heads of state publicly denies the act of the Holocaust, one of the greatest tragedies of human existence. In ""American History X,"" one can deny that it existed, but one cannot deny the true hatred that is planted in each of us.The film revolves around Edward Norton, a NeoNazi who runs a group of hatred-filled white boys into looting and pillaging. After committing murder himself, he is locked into prison. His brother, Edward Furlong (in a great performance,) begins to follow in his footsteps, with the same friends and leaders his older brother had being held up in high regard. Once out of prison, Norton must turn his brother away from this path before it kills his whole family.As usual, Norton is spellbinding, and incredible to watch. From watching the pure hatred in his eyes when he kills to the desperation and tears when he needs help, he is utterly convincing always, and provides a character one cannot help but latch onto.Edward Furlong gives what I think to be the best performance of his career, downplayed and subtle, as the younger brother. He is best displayed at his callous disregard for his African-American peers, and then at his racist slander with Ethan Suplee. His character, often a silent observer, is wonderfully enacted by this young man who, if he continues along this road, could easily be another star when he gets older.To me, Beverly D'Angelo and Ethan Suplee are the wife from National Lampoon and the 3D-picture-watcher from Mallrats, respectively. When I saw them in the cast list, I let out a chuckle, but both gave stark portrayals: D'Angelo is at her peak when she screams, ""I'm embarrassed you came out of my body!"", and Suplee almost makes ""The White Man Marches On"" amusing to watch if not for its highly disturbing slander.A Fairuza Balk fan, I was pleased to see her in it, though I think her part could have been bigger. More impact could have been given to her still-racist comments to Norton upon his release, but she was, of course, a pleasure to watch.Avery Brooks was captivating as the role I knew there would have to be: the highly-intelligent, role-model black man. It was all too obvious this part would come up, and luckily it was well-done. Elliot Gould's part, while small, was great to watch as a Jewish man whose girlfriend's son, Norton, razes him with anti-semetic comments.However, all of this would be useless without the intricacies of the plot. I found myself nearly agreeing with what Norton and William Russ (in a brief but truly disturbing performance) was saying to some point about hate crimes and affirmative action, even what they were saying about Rodney King. But the point of the movie is that, to quote Edward Furlong, ""Hate is baggage."" One can be filled with hate, but to extend it to such proportions is useless and degrading to us all. It is a downer, yes, but one that should be seen by all, if only to make some people see exactly how this impacts everyone. The violence, though much vaunted, isn't that much at all compared to most movies these days with much lower AMA ratings.And yes, I am a white man. I am also half-Hispanic. And I found myself both relating to and recoiling from every word and action from every race and gender. No one is right, and no one is wrong. Go out and rent it. Your brain will thank you.",American History X

1033,atg,Brilliant portrayal of 'real' America - with its blemishes and hope,10,25 February 1999,"When Americans as a whole are willing to see and make films about the flaws in their society and face up to them, then there is hope for the 'hungry, tired and poor' which the country is supposed to embrace.  The film is stunning in its presentation of the polarisation of society at many levels and in many ways.  I believe it should be promoted in American and perhaps foreign schools to make people question and, hopefully, learn and grow.  It will also help to show socities elsewhere in the world that America is not the fairy tale land of Disney, Armageddon and 90210.  The film is accurately dark, but shines a beacon of light that through understanding, and not through confrontation, is the key to individual and social happiness.  10 out of 10 for willingness to 'look in the mirror'.  It says something about America that the director is not American.  Are American entertainers quite ready to see themselves as they are, and not as the myth tells them they are?  More movies like this will say ""yes, finally"".PS.  The film appears to borrow a little from the Australian film 'Romper Stomper'.",American History X

1040,djdeath,"Powerful, provocative, and brilliantly made.",10,10 May 1999,"Powerful, provocative, and brilliantly made, American History X is definitely one of the most thought provoking films of the 90's.  The film's release was great as it was released in the end of the 90's and perfectly reflects how people in this decade react towards race. The film discusses issues such as the Rodney King riots, illegal immigration and black history in schools, which are all relevant to people in the 90's and are often hotly debated.  This film shows the most violent, extreme and shocking side of these debates, but manages to keep the visual violence to a minimum, unlike the violent Australian neo-nazi film ""Romper Stomper"".Edward Norton was astounding, as too was Furlong, as a neo-nazi skinhead. Everybody has been praising Norton's performance, deservedly so, however I feel Furlong really made the movie what it is.  His portrayal of the young and impressionable little brother is great, as he manages to capture those traits in an applaudable manner, and really brings his character to the forefront of this movie, more so than, I dare say, was expected.  Norton however SHOULD have won the best actor Oscar for this role.  Tony Kaye has done a wonderful debut job on this film, particularly the way he made the flashbacks into black and white, and deserves high praise for his work.Everyone should see this movie.  It WILL make you think about your actionsin the past and most definitely your actions in the future.  You will think twice about using a racist slur in any situation in life.  It may even make you see your friends in a different light or maybe even yourself.",American History X
1041,orlo,A series of cliches,1,17 April 1999,"I found it hard to enjoy this film due to the overuse of tacky advertising techniques like slow motion (that were too slow), black and white for the flashbacks and general obvious editing and camera work - like when he has been raped in the shower and is lying on the floor. We see a close up of his Nazi Swastika (as if to hammer home the obvious point). This film tries to be poetic but doesn't succeed. After leaving the cinema, I had forgotten everything. This film doesn't even get close to a film such as The Haine, which had a much stronger build up of characters and story, and leaves a significant impact on the viewer, who can identify with the characters.

The b&w footage for the past and the color for the present made the movie a bit easier to follow with all its jumping back and forth.  But the jumping back and forth helps make its point, to keep things fresh on your mind throughout the movie.If you love America and dare to improve upon it, with out the endless need of finger pointing, give this one a view.

1046,Olbaid-2,Edward Norton displays phenomenal acting in this great film,8,8 June 1999,This was a great film.  The acting is superb (especially Norton's) the script is for the most part very solid and there is some excellent cinematic techniques.  The one problem is that it is fairly clear that the film you are watching is not the director's vision.  There are many scenes that leave you confused since the dialogue refers to previous scenes that were cut by the studio.  All in all this is a very daring film and was a big risk but is incredibly successful in portraying the racial problems in North American society.,American History X

Definitely overlooked as one of the best performances in the last few years. Unfortunate that a film such as this is needed in society, but it succeeds better than any other with the same theme. I haven't read all the comments about this film so I hope this isn't repeated but clearly the most important scene is the conversation at the dinner table with Derek and his father discussing his new teacher (Avery Brooks-also stellar in the film). This is the genesis for the rest of the movie-although Derek's development from the good student prior to this conversation to the extremist he becomes is lost to the natural lack of development that must occur in film, but clearly this type of ""harmless"" dinner chatter (and obviously the circumstances of his father's death) must be emphasized in film and life as powerful.",American History X

Rarely does a movie give us that opportunity to actually think about its message.  The racism and how the most unlikely of characters overcomes his feeling of racism (Edward Norton should have won an Oscar for this one)touches every single member of American society, racist or not, because we all have seen acts of racism.  I think this is a must-see for everyone.",American History X

1050,Zombied,"Very powerful movie,and must see as well",9,22 July 1999,"Although American History X does somewhat lag in the early beginning,and on top of it may slightly come across with a TV movie feel to it,the film does quickly pick up and is quite powerful in it's depiction of a disgruntled young mans coming to terms with the death of his father who was killed by minorities during the LA riots,Director Tony Kaye has a very riveting formula to make the viewer almost somewhat understand and relate as to why young Derek would associate himself with his neo nazi counterparts.This in turn is the sole reason why the movie really is so hard hitting and all the more gutsy. As for the dialogue,i must admit there were some scenes which were next to brilliant,kudos to writer David Mckenna.As for Edward Nortons acting i can truly say it was a very well acted and well a delivered portrayal,i can see hands down why he won such critical acclaim and was also awarded the nomination for best supporting actor.All in all i think American History X is well worth a rental,movies like this do not come around everyday.",American History X
1051,Cherub-6,Edward Norton was great,10,7 July 1999,"This movie is one of the best movies ever made. Edward Norton gave a great performance.  He worked out hard to get into shape for this movie.  Derek Vynyard(Edward Norton) might have had a stupid cause with the skinhead thing, but he was a leader.  He picked a cause that he liked and he was not a hypocrite.  He had a cause and he would have died for it. Even though racism is wrong, I like how he was such a leader.  Hate is wrong.",American History X
1052,Noodles-22,Extremely powerful and moving. Definitely an Oscar-calibre performance.,10,20 July 1999,"When I think of the movie American History X, I see an image.  An image of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, eyes ablaze and standing in the street wearing only a pair of white boxer shorts.  The big bold swastika on his chest sticks out and has a sort of character that says, ""Hey.  Get the f*ck out of my way or you'll be sorry.""The story is about Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who is somewhat of a white supremicy leader, and his younger brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong). Derek has just spent 3 years of his life in jail because he has murdered 2 people.  American History X chronicles the emotional and psychological change of Derek Vinyard -- after spending his time in jail, he realizes that life is too short to be pissed off, and nothing that he's done (white supremicy-wise) has made his life better and hating is not the way to a better life.  He's also trying to teach this lesson to Daniel Vinyard because he is afraid that his younger brother will fall in the same ill-fated footsteps.  It also shows the emotional pain that his family must go through because he has to face the concequences of hate.The bottom line of this movie is simple -- hate does not lead to a better life, and, quoted from the movie, ""life's too short to be pissed off.""My rating:  ****/****",American History X

It's about hate, but more than that it's about American society as a whole and how the system works or doesn't. I was not completely in love with Edward Norton until seeing this film, he's one of the best in the business. This film was directed by Tony Kaye, who also did the cinematography of the film, this man has vision. There many new techniques and visual angles that make this film the fine film that it is.

American History X was so strikingly bad though that I'm considering an attempt to sue for my wasted time. :-)The Plot:  Give the audience some credit!  American History X was painfully heavy-handed.  The word, ""Duh,"" sprang to mind (and often mouth) every few seconds.  Challenge us...make us thing...leave some loose ends.  Ed Furlong's 18-hour redemption plan?  Please!The Cinematography:  I don't know who's to blame; my guess is Tony Kaye. How could something smack of pretension and look like an MTV show?  Cut, pan, cut, pan, slow-mo, black-and-white.  The camera work is symbolic of the film.  Kaye never visually engages the characters and perhaps that's part of the reason that AHX is so ineffectual.Ed Norton did what he could with a weak script and a poor director. Unfortunately, the most impressive thing about the movie was the way Norton changed his body for the role.  Tony Kaye (understandly) tried to remove his name from this ""opus"" and claimed that Norton was responsible for the editing.  If that's true, let's hope Ed Norton sticks to acting and Tony Kaye goes back to music videos.",American History X

When watching this movie I wasn't thinking ""I hope everything goes right for Ed Norton's character"" I was thinking ""I hope everything turns out all right for Derek"".

1067,hbinc,A very polemical film that has some great acting in it as well!,10,14 October 2001,"American History X is a film that looks at racism in the today's society and how it is simply a form of ignorance that has existed in this country for many years. As a minority college student I found this film to be intriguing as well as polemical because it looked at a man by the name of Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) and how his views of other ethnicities simply changed because of an event that happened earlier in his life. Because of that as well as other family influences he went on to believe that all minorities were simply in the United States because they ""slipped through the cracks"" because some immigrants were over here in the US illegal and he also believed that they were trying to take what the ""white man"" has owned for years and that simply is not the case. Norton's character eventually becomes incarcerated and this eventually leads to his complete reformation which I found to be amazing but in the same sense it let me know that anyone can change their belief of something such as racism, they just have to want to do so first. American History X is an excellent movie with some great acting and a good movie for anyone who has views on racism or hating someone else because of their race.",American History X
1068,jwlynn,A very good depiction of the lure and danger associated with hate groups.,9,1 June 2000,"I thought that this movie did an excellent job of showing both the allure and the danger associated with hate groups.The director did an excellent job of showing how Cameron used Derek's anger at the loss of his father to gain influence over him.As bad as it sounds, you experienced the high when Derek won the court from the black youths.  In that instant, you can almost feel the pride that he had in gaining a ""safe"" place where white youths can play basketball.From there however, it is a quick ride back to reality as the events in Derek's life force him to see the flaws in his ideology and the bigger flaws in the other ""believers"".I thought that all of the characters were believable and the movie was edited very well.  I definitely recommend this movie.",American History X

1070,joehiggins,"Good, but lacking something...",7,4 October 2000,"Spoilers lie within...American History X came to me highly recommended and having just seen it I can see why.Edward Norton stars as the racist skinhead Derek Vinyard, who after killing two black guys trying to steal his car gets sent to prison. While he is inside his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is going down the same track as he did and on the day of his brothers release hands in a paper called ""My Mein Kampf"". Derek now reformed tries to stop his brother from going the same way as he did.I thought that film, while being powerful and, at times, shocking (see the brutal kerbing scene) it lacked something.It was a film for the 3 minute attention span generation, in that it seemed too short and the 2 brothers found redemption extraordinarily quickly (and in the case of Derek it was slightly cliched) I also thought that it got tied up in a fairly predictable story line after a while.That said it does have many good moments and Edward Norton gives a performance worthy of his Oscar nomination.7/10",American History X

Edward Furlong was good too, but it was Ed Norton who really stole the show....I acn't say enough good things about this movie... I read a review though, that said that they didn't really give a reason for his all of a sudden anti-rasist behaviour. Well, let me think, it might have something to do with what happened to him in jail!!!!

Some people say this movie is a cliche and doesn't have much of a plot. I disagree. I loved this movie, its deep, and amazing, and just incredibly smart. it forces the viewer to really think, not just watch.The story portrays the events of one day, the day that Derek, a highly respected new-nazi got home from prison after serving there 3 years for a double homicide. So while Derek was forced, through extremely difficult situations and events in prison, to rethink his whole life and the ideology that has been forced upon him, his young brother Dany chose to walk the deadly path Derek chose before, the movie shows the tragic events of this family, and shows how they led to the hate and hopelessness that consumes it now.This movie is about hate, and what it can do. It shows how unexpectedly it comes, and what it does. Violence doesn't have to be a way of life, and some legacies must end, for they have done much damage through their hate. Sometimes life if just unfair, and you can't undo the damage that you have done before.",American History X

But it's impossible. This film affects you in a way that really makes you realise just how powerful cinema as an artform can be.This fable, about a Neo-Nazi who, during a stint in a particularly brutal prison, sees the wrong of his ways, is so powerful. Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, our anti-hero, gives (for me) the definitive performance for any serious actor to follow. Travis Bickle, Harry Hill- all eclipsed. The Academy, in their infinite wisdom, chose not to award an Oscar to Norton, but one feels that here, there's the possibility that he is Derek Vinyard, and it would be wrong to give him any recognition. However, there's no ham acting here, and Norton is surrounded by a cast who never have, nor ever will produce better roles. Edward Furlong is perfect as the naive young man, idolising his brother, whilst Beverly D'Angelo plays her part so beautifully that I was wanting to put my arm around her and tell her that everything was going to be okay.However, it's not, and the brilliant use of cinematography mixed with the raw energy surrounding the film  make it something that you have to see, if only because it'll be unlike anything you've ever seen before...",American History X
1075,torf,An amazing portrayal of a difficult subject,10,13 October 2000,"I write these short few paragraphs only minutes after the closing scene of 'American History X', a film, which evocatively displays the effect of racism on our society.  It can be seen as an emotionally affecting documentary on the inability of men to live together in harmony.  A brutal, often graphic picture was painted and is an impossible movie to enjoy, but we can merely absorb and inwardly digest its message.The film was wonderfully shot, and its inevitable climax was expected but shocking.  Without going into too much detail it is impossible to describe the emotion cursing through my veins.  The constant use of switching from black and white film to colour also makes the continuous point throughout that they should be able to coexist.I find it difficult to recommend this movie to anyone.  However, if easily offended it may be too much to sit through in order to gain the full message.  The first hour of the film is wonderfully captured and a complete contrast to the ultimate end.Not many films can affect right to the core, but American History X manages it.  A difficult and controversial subject matter handled superbly by director and writer alike.  Top class performances by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong (who has matured brilliantly since T2) manage to elevate this superb film into a masterpiece.  I cannot speak more highly. 10/10",American History X

Fear takes over. And innocense becomes ignorance. I think that with this scene or picture, the director tries to tell you, that it can happen to you too. Some things in life just happen.

A superb plot combined with magnificent acting makes this one of the all time greats. From the films opening scenes to its gripping, knife-edge conclusion, the film powefully portrays one man's struggle to assimilate back into society after serving a prison sentence for race related crimes. The film weaves ingeniously between the flashbacks and the present state of Edward Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, a one time neo-Nazi, who's violent hatred of America's multi-cultural society culminates in the brutal murder of two men. Derek's imprisonment proves to be a life-changing experience, as upon his release he appears to his adoring family and friends as a reformed man, who's appearance, beliefs & ideology have drastically changed. With a clean slate, Derek now faces the gruelling challenge of rescuing his brother from following the same doomed path which resulted in his own incarceration. I was genuinely absorbed with this film from start to finish and although fictional, I felt it fully demonstrated the dangers and damaging consequences of racism.

It is a social education in itself and an object lesson in human relations gone wrong. The script is so real that you are actually there. All of the acting is so good that one tends to believe the actors' value system are reflected in their lines, although this could not be so because if they believed what they are saying they could not cooperate with each other. All of this is paced and timed by marvelously direction.Although the theme and script are specifically American they portray and expound a kind of problem which is perhaps the most universal human failing, i.e. suspicion and fear of difference and of otherness. Also a fearful adherence to the pseudo-safety of the status quo no matter what the expense to the other. The film elegantly and brutally demonstrates that the safety of uniformity and bigotry is illusory and ultimately destructive",American History X

1083,DunkinDan89,Norton's Pitch-Perfect Performance Makes 'X' a Must-See,10,6 January 2007,"There's a scene in ""American History X"" in which Derek Vinyard glances back at his younger brother, Danny, who's staring at the heinous crime his older brother has just committed. Derek's face alternates between pride and joy, all the way down to horror and shock in only a few moments time. This is the scene that basically identifies what the film truly is, a movie about a lot of prideful people about something truly horrifying and frightening.Racism.The story centralizes in on two very messed up and brainwashed characters, that being Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny (played by another Edward, Edward Furlong). Both are victims of the cleverly seducing Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), a white supremacist who targets young, socially insecure Caucasian males to join a group in which Hitler is exalted and ""justice"" is encouraged among the lower classes of society.Derek joins the group out of hate for what has happened to his family, that being the murder of his father by men of a different race. He is a brilliant student, as seen by the high regard teacher Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) holds for him, but that all changes in a few short years. Derek becomes a god among men, commanding complete respect by others in the group, as well as the respect of his extremely troubled family, even if he may fly off the handle more than an average person would. The multi-dimensional Derek eventually winds up in prison for that crime his younger brother witnessed. At a point in the film, it is revealed to us that if his brother would have testified, Derek would have gotten life. After serving his time however, he is a completely changed man, someone whose life goal seems set upon helping his younger brother swerve away from the path he is on, the same path Derek treaded upon when he was his age.The skill and creativity of the movie is seen early on. The film changes back and forth between the current events going on in Derek and Danny's life as well as flashbacks of what both went through when they were juveniles. Director Tony Kaye uses a black and white scope during the flashback scenes, while colorizing the ""now"" part of their lives, something I have never seen done before.All in all, I admire this film. Its a preachy movie, but its on a topic that is still very much at large in our society nowadays. Norton delivers one of the best performances I have ever watched, seeing as its not very easy to go from a neo-Nazi skinhead to a family man all in two hours time, but he does it successfully. Norton makes the viewer believe that he is not Edward Norton, but the sick and twisted Derek Vinyard. The language and content of the movie are both very rough, dealing with uncomfortable prison scenes as well as extremely vivid turmoil among the Vinyard family. Norton and Furlong are incredible as the two brothers, and a strong supporting cast in Brooks, Keach, and Beverly D'Angelo make the film a gem.Its not often that a movie comes along and completely changes the opinion on how I view the world and racism in general, but I can say ""American History X"" certainly accomplished this in captivating fashion.",American History X
1084,reynoso_juan,This movie rocks!!!! (and is true in most ways!),10,22 April 2006,"When i started to watch this movie I thought is was just be another crappy documentary about the Neo-Nazis and their uprising. I have seen a lot of them on the History Channel and they all suck! But as I watched the movie further and further I realized it was more emotional than I first perceived. The movie gave you true to life scenes of what it is to be a modern white Skinhead. All the parts were played perfectly, Edward Nortons' acting is superb. He plays the role so strongly that sometimes you believe that he REALLY is a Nazi (althought he is not). The drama in this movie is so realistic and very violent too. For example there is a scene is this movie where Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is in prison and gets raped by his fellow Skinheads because Derek believed they did not convey the views of the Aryan (Neo-Nazi) brotherhood like they were supposed to. Furthermore, after he is raped, one of his old history teacher in high school talks to him about his brother Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong: T2 actor). Daniel is Derek's older brother and he is killed at the end of the movie because he was a skinhead. Overall this movie is so true to life that it seems like a documentary but it is a movie. A must watch. ( NOT FOR THE KIDS THOUGH!!!)",American History X
1085,thedietcokeofevil,Superb!,10,25 April 2006,"Not a film that I really rushed to see but one that I've now seen again and again. Without wanting to give any spoilers, if you thought Edward Norton's performance in Fight Club was half decent... see this film. In my opinion career best performances from both Ed Norton and Ed Furlong, with great performances from the rest of the cast. A story of hate, hypocrisy and manipulation. A superb script and excellent direction make a film that is emotionally gripping, politically powerful and entertaining. Anyone who is not moved by this film is not human ;o) I really can't say anymore aside from this... Stop whatever you're doing and go watch it NOW!!!",American History X

1087,thesteve86,what is the film trying to say??,8,9 May 2006,"I have just finished watching this film for the 3rd time and it still shocks me. Without doubt it is one of the most controversial films ever to be produced.The first thing that strikes me as a viewer is the direction and cinematography which is apparent from the opening scenes. ALthough it is cliché to say that black and white is 'powerful' i believe it is the lighting in these scenes that make it so. The shadowy look of the room Derek and Stacy are in highlights the darkness surrounding the period of time that the scene takes place. Throughout the film the cut scenes, flash backs and numerous slow-mo close ups are seamlessly directed and provide the intensity needed for a film based on such an important and rage-filled subject.The subject is something that the viewer will be aware of before watching the film but when it is explored by Tony Kaye, this is where is enthrals me. This could so easily have been a mediocre film about race without the intelligence shown in the script. For instance the argument between Derek and Murray and more specifically Dereks speech at the dinner table brings to light the political awareness of David McKenna. This way of at least showing that some of the base views shrouded by racism are actually logical is something that makes the film engrossing.Perhaps the most engrossing factor of the film is the plot and characterisation. The 'bad boy turned good' plot is initially not particularly original but the way Edward Norton and Edward Furlong portray this is fantastic. How Norton captures the emotions of a man in turmoil is exceptional and will always be one of the most memorable performances i have witnessed in film.American History X has been widely critically acclaimed and so it should be. It is brilliantly directed and expertly written so much so that a person who watches this film will not only be shocked but absorbed into the political aspects of it.",American History X
1088,baseballguy07,Amazing Movie,10,13 May 2006,"Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. This movie not only has an amazing story, but the artistic value is tremendous. The stark contrast between the black and white scenes versus the color adds so much to the film. I can't remember another movie that I've seen that impressed me so much artistically.Norton embodies his character so well, as does Furlong. They go beyond characters on a screen to create a relationship between them and the viewer. By the end of the movie it's as if you've known them and been a part of their struggle.If you've not seen this movie, you should make it a priority.",American History X
1089,xonexbyxonex,The most amazing movie I've ever seen.,10,25 June 2006,"Honestly, this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. And I tend to watch meaningful movies. What I mean is, I'm not putting this movie up against Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle and saying it's amazing. There is so much to learn from American History X. It should be a requirement. The acting is incredible, also. But the storyline is what really gets you; this stuff really happens. All of it, it's all so realistic. I borrowed a copy of this movie to watch and I've watched it every day since I borrowed it. I don't plan on giving it back until I've purchased my own copy. Both Edwards (Norton and Furlong) give incredible performances in this movie. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, can learn at least one thing from American History X. I highly recommend it.",American History X
1090,robwest-87581,Why do so many people like this movie?,1,10 November 2019,"I had this movie recommended to me strongly as an instant classic, one of the best movies ever made. Not only was this movie not great, it wasn't even good. It was pretentious and heavy-handed, with a nonsensical story line trying so hard to mass itself off as gritty and profound. The swelling, dramatic orchestral music is horribly overused, along with such other tired cinematic cliches as unnecessary slow-motion to show the audience that they are seeing a pivotal moment, and black-and-white as a pseudo-artistic sign that we are seeing a flashback. The whole thing has a very cheesy after school special-type feel.The dialog is awful, both in its writing and delivery. Every line is spoken in anger, and nearly every line by the main characters contains the f-word, which is spoken louder and slower than every other word for emphasis, so you know these are angry, mean people talking. The dialog is unrealistic and forced, and watching it leaves you feeling like it was written by Kevin Smith, trying to write a Very Special Episode.The frame story is completely irrelevant and serves only to give the movie a title. The principal tells Edward Furlong's character that he will now be taking a special course called American History X, in order to learn the folly of liking Mein Kampf. Instead of seeing the progression of the character over weeks as he learns difficult, complex lessons about life and love versus hate, Furlong is told to write a paper about his brother (Norton), who is about to be released from prison after serving a long, three-year sentence for triple homicide(?). Over the course of the night, Norton tells everyone that he doesn't want to be a Neo Nazi anymore. Furlong doesn't take his seriously, and goes to a Neo Nazi party that evening instead of (but also apparently in addition to) writing the paper. Norton later tells Furlong that the Nazis were mean to him in prison, so Furlong changes everything about his outlook overnight and writes a paper expressing that. Then he gets killed by some angry black guys in the bathroom before turning in his paper, because that's apparently a fine substitute for an actual ending to the story.I mean, it's a little more complex than that, but not much. It's not any less dumb than that, though.If you like dramatic music, people being pointlessly angry, characters who are either completely one-dimensional or incredibly inconsistent, melodramatic music, people yelling ""No!"" in slow motion, black-and-white as an ""artistic"" choice, and being beaten over the head by an unbelievably obvious moral with very little human relatability, this movie is for you.",American History X

This is a true statement ""Violence as a way of life"" This film shows thee affects and the danger that racism brings upon hate rid, pain, suffering and other things. Every time I sit in my living room and watch this again, and again. I get something new out of it every time. But it also displays that the hate the world has for each other, why do we as mankind always turn to violence, and hurt, and hate rid when we get mad. A quote that Edward Furlong says when he is shot has been making me think for a very long time. That quote is "" Well this is where I tell you what I have learned, my conclusion right. Well my conclusion is hate is baggage and life is to short to be pissed off all the time it's just not worth it"" That is true he is trying to tell us that we should stay happy not mad.

It's the kind of unbearable truth that should make you see that you are exactly the same as Danny or Derek, even if you say in your head, ""I'm not that awful."" It's painful because it has to be. I think this is the film that has the capacity to revolutionize our flawed society, if only to promote discussion and change some minds. Ignorance only spawns further ignorance, so see it; hear the message. I recommend seeing it with children old enough to tolerate violence and look beyond it. Talk about the themes of the movie with kids, as, in my opinion, this film was created to spark conversation about the issues of hate, prejudice and defining one's self.

This film deals heavily with the aspects of racial bigotry in Venice Beach, CA showing us the power of what is wrong and the extent to which is effects everyone. Edward Norton is a fantastic actor in all of his films and certainly does not sell himself short in this film as well. Last, but certainly not least, the cinematic style of this film is truely unique and notably one of the best I have ever seen.

I love the way you can see the change in Norton after he comes out of prison and how he has to cope with his friends/family feeling differently. I thought the ending was very clever but sad too Edward Norton is fantastic, hes such a under-rated actor but he chooses all the good parts!

I must say after reading a lot of you guys post, racism will always be alive and well in America. We can try all we can to change it, but it will never change. Me personally I see people not color, some of my best friends are caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, whatever nationalities racist people see. I believe this movie sheds light on the few people that do make a change and stand for what is right. After this movie Ed Norton became one of my favorite actors.

The film has questionable scenes and dialog however, a very mentionable theme that leaves the viewer with many personal questions, ideas and thoughts of racial inequality and prejudice. The movie leaves the viewer with an astounding ending and truly touches each viewer so as to keep them thinking; thinking of racial conflicts in the movie and in their own lives. The movie is directed wonderfully so as not to confuse the viewer when the main character's little brother, Danny, recollects past events in his family's life. The scenes that are of the past are depicted in black and white, unlike the colored scenes of the present. The acting performed by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong is exceptional; very dramatic and emotional. The movie contains the wonderful element of irony more than once. The overall theme stays with the viewer and is just inspiring; inspiring to do for all races because we are all people. The movie's music, dialog and ""eventful"" scenes all contribute to the mood of the movie very well. You, as the viewer, can truly feel the hatred the actors feel towards other races; you might even feel disgust on the basis of their thoughts and preemptive actions. The movie questions your own thoughts and actions towards others. The film is about how we, as individuals, choose to live. I recommend this film to young teens and adults all around. It is a very dramatic and inspiring film full of amazing tone, mood and irony. The movie will touch all in some way and stick with you while you keep thinking of racial issues discussed in the movie.",American History X

Ed Norton SHOULD have won for this role but I guess a nomination will have to suffice.  I have never seen an actor portray such anger and hatred WITHOUT the use of words, everyone who has seen the movie knows the scene I am referring to...... and to those that haven't seen it yet..... you'll know it when it happens.  Ed Furlong does an excellent job in a supporting role which shows he has grown up since his Terminator 2 days, and seeing Bev D'angelo so gritty threw me for a loop.  We ain't watching a Vacation movie anymore.....American History X deals with centuries of racism in about an hour and a half but does it intellectually, without choosing sides but including the violence and raw human terror that has accompanied the black-white debate over the years.I consider this movie a defining movie of the decade and potentially of all time........",American History X

Edward Furlong plays the part of Norton's brother, and with a strong supporting cast, this film will, WILL make an impression on you. Make your own decision on this film. Others have expressed that this movie is too cliché, too predictable, etc. Others say it is one of the most influential films of the 90's. Once seen, you will lean one way or the other, but my guess is that you'll lean towards influence. In my opinion, this film discusses race issues we still deal with today from a fresh perspective of a higher class of white supremacy, and does a spectacular job of offering life lessons without preaching about normal diversity and race related issues we often hear today in our schools, businesses, and media. Regardless of what people say, especially on this website, this film is a must see.",American History X

I will not write a review about this movie because I would end up writing a spoiler. You have to see this movie. It is truly a very moving film. This movie teaches about the stupidity of being prejudice and how it can effect ones life if they really get involved. It also states in the film that prejudice is caused by anger.

There are scenes within which are brutal, repulsive, and vile. Yet, they need to be. American History X focuses on a family fallen to Neo-Nazism and arrogant white supremacy. Opposite are gangs of street-hardened minorities and illegal immigrants. A school principal fights against the hatred. Avery Brooks, while rarely on screen commands the drama and bends in to his iron-clad will.The result is a film dark as midnight and as effective as a hired killer. Its message is sharp and precise as the film enters its final moments. The oppressors are all too human, their victims far from innocent. It portrays a world which is not simple black and white but shades of all too familiar dark gray.This is a film you need to see, to appreciate, to understand.

""American History X"" touches a subject, which I can no longer say isn`t used enough, because every movie maker not only think that their views on the subject of racism are brilliant, but also original, and usually the product ends up being incredibly pompous and pretty boring. However, I can say that director Tony Kaye and writer David Mckenna do not fall under that category. While it is hard to be original in this subject, ""American History X"" was simply brilliant and one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.Edward Norton gives not only the performance of his life, but one of the top ones ever. The fact that he didn`t win the oscar shows truly how messed up the academy awards are. Norton plays a former neo-nazi, who basically becomes a born-again human being while being incarcerated for manslaughter. Norton more or less played 2 roles this movie and nailed them both. After being released from prison Norton does everything he can to keep his brother(played by Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps.This movie was so great, I won`t even bother to insult it by attempting to give it a rating.

American History X is one of the most powerful and in your face movies I have ever seen.  The movie will lead you through a maze of emotions as you watch.  You will cry, you will become angry, and you will laugh (not much, though).  I enjoyed this movie very much, mainly because it shows the struggle of a reformed racist fighting to save his brother from the ignorance of nazism and racism.  The way the movie is filmed and written, mostly in a flashback (all of which is filmed in black and white) makes it easy to follow the story.  It is well written and the movie flows exceptionally well.  The movie is as brutally honest as it is brutally violent.  The violence shown is enough to startle and shock almost anyone, but all of the violence is done in good taste.  If you are interested in reality-based movies that aren't afraid to show you what is going on in society, then this is the movie for you.  Also recommended is Romper Stomper with Russell Crowe.",American History X

1130,mainmanmitch,A brilliant film,10,13 June 2007,"This film is brilliant, pure class. It shows directly the consequences of being a white supremacist. It managed to get a true portrayal of Skinheads in America, people say that the shower scene wasn't needed, it is one of the most effective scenes in there and it's the major turning point of the film. The last scene of the film though is one of the single most effective pieces of cinema in recent years, it doesn't pussy out and let him live because he's changed his ways, it kills him for his past convictions. Now i rate this film highly up there with my favourite (taxi Driver, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, The Departed and Trainspotting). I'm not trying to say go out and see it but if you get a chance watch it. Not for the squeamish or the immature. If you like it i suggest you watch This Is England and Qudrophenia two films about English gang culture (Skinheads came from Mods)",American History X

Which probably has something to do with their tastes or lifetime experiences - you name it.Impressive acting and some clever scenes including inside the prison. The ending is never fully explained though, and I only found out who the shooter was by looking on wikipedia. Even so, nobody would be so extremist as to kill someone for simply blowing smoke in their face, especially a high school student. I also didn't get the ""wow"" feeling I got after I watched movies like V for Vendetta or Green Street, probably because of the weak ending.

At times oversimplified and a little too symbolic, which is why I wouldn't give it a perfect 10, but these directing flaws can easily be forgiven for the merits of good acting. Most characters have enough depth not to be sorted into just ""good"" or ""bad"" categories, which is quite rare for a film with such a charged subject as racial hate, or, for that matter, any subject for which the officially ""right"" point of view has been formed. In times when political correctness goes above truth, and people are presented preformed sterile opinions without knowing why, this film should be seen by every young generation.",American History X

Norton (another great performance), but now i'm glad i had the chance to watch this fabulous movie, almost 10 years after it was made.. 10/10, great story, cast, picture. When the movie started i though it was another lame movie about white supremacy and etc, but it keeps going into a great quality plot and very revealing consistent movie. The end is very quick and kind of sad, but the movie is all about that: Life.Just the way it is.""We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.

1135,mariok-4,"An examination of racism, in both directions, that is brutal, but brutally honest",7,13 July 2007,"I'm not quite sure which planet the last reviewer lives on, but to suggest that racism doesn't exist purely because of the colour of a person's skin is being either naive or in denial. This film portrays just how one-dimensional racists and white supremacists really are. The main character's views, played by Edward Norton, on white supremacy are second hand, as are his young brother's (played by Edward Furlong). Their conversion to racism is dramatic, almost akin to the conversion on the way to Damascus, and yet highly plausible. Their deliverance is again dramatic, and this can possibly be because their racist convictions were not necessarily genuine, or deeply held. I'm not quite sure why the last reviewer thought that class and other weightier topics were ignored, I believe they're present, but not rammed down your throat, after all, this is a movie about the dark side of humanity that comes clothed in racism,and racism in both directions. It isn't attempting to explore issues of poverty, mental illness etc. as I said, other issues do feature, you only have to be observant. This film, unfortunately, is as relevant today as it was when it was first made almost ten years ago.People are still dying on our streets (and corner shops) because of the colour of their skin, or their ethnic origin. The parts, in the main, are well played, although had they lengthened the film by another 10 -15 minutes, then they could have explored, a bit more, the characters of the mother and sister.Elliot Gould's character, unfortunately, fails to develop, and Avery Brooks does come across as a bit of a stereotypical crusader. On the whole, a movie well worth watching. not thought provoking, rather a pretty good mirror on the worst elements of society.",American History X
1136,kristina-madsen,American Atrocity X,5,27 July 2007,"I believe this film fails to do what it set out to. Intentions were doubtless noble but there are too many simplifications there for it to be convincing.First of all, we see next to nothing of the brainwashing that the supposedly highly intelligent Derek must have gone through in order to become the person he is in the beginning. The filmmakers seem to think that a few scenes with Derek's father spewing benighted nonsense is enough to explain that. I would have thought that the propaganda would have to be fed to him in a more intelligent, subtle way for him to buy into it, but apparently he just takes his father's (inane) word as gospel while he learns nothing from his mother. And this even though whatever brains he has he definitely inherited from her - daddy is nothing but derisive about Derek's doing well at school. Now why would a smart boy be so one-sidedly influenced by the parent with whom he has the least in common? Second, the same goes for his transformation the other way round. I understand that the film is ""based on a true story"" (not that *that* is usually a stamp of excellence), so the transformation did happen. But I do suspect that something has been left out. Don't get me wrong, it's fine for the film to be very loosely based on the story that inspired it, so long as the film makes its own sense. Sadly, it doesn't. So the other 'Arians' mistreat him (putting it politely), and he finds himself laughing at his black co-worker's joke? Well, Redemption City, here we come. From cold-blooded killer to fluffy do-gooder in two easy steps.And I haven't even begun to talk about the real wrongness: The way the camera accentuates Derek's hot body. The larger-than-life slo-mo of his semi-nude form as he triumphantly turns in the police car's headlights (after stomping the black boy's head into the kerb - or curb, for the American reader). Why is Derek made to look sexy in this scene? Or the Riefenstahl-like - and insultingly unrealistic - basketball scene? Is there a point or was it just that Norton wanted to look good? He succeeded there, but at the expense of what I thought the film was supposed to convey.All in all, the film's message drowns in cliché in form and content both, oversimplification, an embarrassingly tear-jerking score, and Norton's ill-concealed enjoyment of his own sexiness. That, to me, is just plain wrong. I usually like Norton's performances but not this one. No wonder director Tony Kaye washed his hands of it. Rumour has it that Norton took over much of the director's job. That was clearly a mistake. A shame, considering that racism in the US (or anywhere) is an issue that needs to be dealt with properly.",American History X
1137,chavdarb,Powerful movie that makes you think,10,29 July 2007,"It is NOT a typical easy on the viewer movie or a preaching one. I believe the idea is to ask the viewers the questions and to leave up to them to find the answers. I personally asked myself a lot of questions. And related it, to some events in my life. So i got some hidden messages that are well beyond the racism that is simply too obvious and overexploited. It is a shallow explanation for much more deep subjects touched in the movie.People tend to blame someone for their misfortune (polititians,jews, black, gypsies, concrete people) Sometimes they have their justification - a dramatic event in their lives. Especially young people always search for people to look up to, they tend to follow blindly and passionately ideas that gives the ""easy"" explanation of bad things happening around them and with them. And at some point you rational hate , becomes irrational and uncontrollable.Yes ! Life is F***** UP sometimes. BUT the question is not, Who to BLAME but, WHAT did you do, to MAKE it BETTER ? And are your actions really doing any good for you and people around you ?I am not deluded to believe, that all people will get the messages in the movie.

He portrays Adolf Hitler through racism to Hispanics, Yellows, Browns and especially Afro-Americans. Shown through deep acting and emotion, his character has sunk deep into the viewers eye's and catches every attention when on screen. His violence to grief leads him into a state of thought somewhere where thinking is the place. Brother of 'Derek Vinyard' is 'Danny Vinyard' played by Edward Furlong plays a crucial act in this film. As growing up with Derek, he has great influence on him and Derek places a scar on his character.This movie was great because, the story and acting was done so well. I could almost feel the intensity of the scenes. Stories as this really catch my attention because it is realistic and serious.Direction was sensational and unique.

This movies certainly did not do such a good job of making many of the black characters sympathetic, except Lamont. I mean come on, 3 guys with guns, one standing on your front porch and one in your yard and one breaking into your car...are we supposed to feel sympathy for them? I did not like the girl who played Derriks girlfriend...it would have been better in a miniseries perhaps if they had showed him longing for her but at the same time, wanting to leave the gang..instead the breakup was so abrupt. I would have liked to see more of the family flashbacks.

The characters were all pretty well-rounded and all made the story a mind altering experience. The story line was also slightly kind of hard to follow; there was a lot of people that had problems interacting with each other throughout the whole movie. It was dramatic and full of thrill, in the end, its an amazing story with good lessons and messages.

1145,JrPlested,"Quite simply, a masterpiece!",9,21 July 2008,"Before watching this I was thinking of how I thought the movie would be, my imagination didn't even give me a hint of the power this movie has. In this absolute masterpiece Edward Norton plays Derek, a violent yet intelligent skin head who is led to question his beliefs and what he has based his whole life on. Edward Norton plays a very powerful neo-nazi leader, he is praised and respected by all among him. Until one night he murdered two black people who were trying to steal his car. Derek was then sentenced to three years imprisonment, throughout his time he came to realise how wrong he was and that none of his past neo-nazi racist beliefs had helped him actually do anything for him as a person. Throughout this time in the movie you genuenly feel his struggle through prison, which is shown through the intensity of Norton's acting. He then is not helped by people of of his flag and belief, but actually by a black man, the very type of person he had been hating and fighting against for his entire life, and now he owes his life to this man for helping through the most meaningful and impacting experience of his life. This really puts his life in to perspective as Derek realise how wrong he once was, he cannot grasp the fact that he fell for all of it in the first place. After this miraculous change throughout his sentence in prison, he reforms as a person and then is set out to help influence his younger brother Danny, played by Danny Furlong who hadn't ever been seen in a big production like this, Furlong gives us true and meaningful performance of a younger brother trying to follow in the footsteps of his older brother's self. During this heart stoppingly powerful film we see Edward Norton master not one character but two. One of his old enraged neo-nazi self and the other of his reformed and regained self, whom had realised his mistakes in his past violent and tragic life and was trying to save not only himself but his family! Norton plays a totally believable character, going from a brutal killer to a intelligent and intellectual brother. Even though this movie contains a constant theme of violence and racism, it is not trying to judge either the black or white people, it is mearly just trying to focus on the point that it's people's violent and blunt actions which cause this racial divide. This is what this film is aimed to show and does extremely well, being the most powerful, touching, and meaningful movie I have ever seen!",American History X

Having watched Romper Stomper a few days back and reading its reviews, I was reminded of American History X's predictable plot. So I decided to watch it yesterday and prove myself right.. I was in error! This movie blew me away! I was watching it for all the wrong reasons, trying to compare it to a movie (Romper Stomper) that was very different from this one and in a league of its own.

1148,ashley-lewis,A Carefully Thought Out Portrayal of the Subject,9,15 August 2002,"American History X is in my mind both art and entertainment. The wide array of emotions that the viewer is taken through gives immense entertainment value to it. The style with which the story is delivered adds to that value and earns it the title of art.The storyline itself is an unusual and remarkable chronicle of events, but the dialogues, setting and characters are portrayed in a non-glamorous, everyday manner. Take for instance the scene in which Derek (Edward Norton) has come home for the first time. Amidst the setting, a small two bedroom flat, Derek's family look genuinely at home. Watching this scene feels somehow peculiar as though you really are snooping in someone's private life, not some kind of At Home With the Vinyards' reality show, but actually as though you are there in some sense. As all the events unfold around you this strange cinematic reality helps to absorb you a little more into the plot, with the ultimate aim that it shares with any story - to make you forget (at least for the duration) that these things didn't really happen.I believe the idea of this film was not only to give the viewer something to keep them entertained for two hours but also to inform, warn or educate the viewing masses. In a manner to try and make some kind of sense of that which drives the Neo Nazi. As the characters go through their development the key issues that give rise to the irrational hatred of racism and the reasoning that people build to support it are illustrated with a series of bullet-point plot events. We are presented with various different 'flavours' of hatred, and various different classes of racist.In this film the subject of all kinds of prejudice has been laid out on a public operating table and thoroughly dissected, so that anyone may see what drives the beast. What makes some Humans feel such an intense and unfounded dislike to their fellow man? Whilst it is by no means an exhaustive examination it is detailed and vast in nature, and is an element of the film pivotal to its success.The performances in American History X also make the final ingredient for our Really Good Movie Cake Mix. There are some excellent Actors in this cast, but in reality the story only has room for two strong performances, and whilst the supporting roles were on the whole excellently played, they were all simply outshone by Norton and Furlong.I have previously seen only 2 of Norton's leads, the Score and Fight Club. Each and every one of these 3 roles demands a completely different performance from this immensely talented actor, and I cannot fault the manner in which he has risen to the challenge on every occasion here we see a tremendous progression in his character which, despite receiving certain criticisms elsewhere, I believe to have been portrayed flawlessly, which is certainly supported by the fact that when the awards ceremonies came round the following year, Norton was the only man to be holding the awards (Golden Satellite and SEFCA) even against tough competition in that year.
Edward Furlong could not have possibly improved his performance as Derek's younger brother Danny from start to finish. Although it may be true that the film takes a while to find its feet and the better scenes are mostly at the end, there was something about Furlong's performance that shone through even in the opening minutes. He manages to show the sensitivity and intellectual properties of the otherwise boisterous and angry character at just the right levels.Notable supporting roles come from Ethan Suplee as Seth and Avery Brooks as Sweeney. Ethan has enjoyed fame comedy roles (Particularly throughout the Kevin Smith Films) but here he demonstrates his acting talents in a *slightly* more serious role, I say slightly because despite the dark nature of his character you can't help but grin at some of the more socially impaired qualities of his role. He portrays the typicalMost people will know Avery Brooks from his long standing role as Captain Sisko, a role which requires similar traits to that of Sweeney, it might be because of this that his performance comes off strangely natural when you watch him initially, but on more careful deliberation he seems too wooden in the role, although this is probably partly the fault of the script. Sweeney is a Teacher, with 2 PhD's under his cap, so why is he not teaching at a better college? The character does come across with a certain attitude of wanting to be helping where he can help most, but this good natured quality, even coupled with his caring and compassionate still don't excuse his presence in this college, his position seems to be below him. Sweeney is also as a some sort of Obi-Wan-Kenobi imparting pearls of wisdom at seemingly appropriate times and conveniently saving a lot of time by explaining other events with a few lines instead of requiring a couple of scenes.All in all American History X is the film maker's way of saying `Why can't we all just get along?' but this film does it with a gun pressed to your temple. The touch subject matter has been carefully considered and then attacked full on, and I must say it works. Although within the first twenty minutes of this film I thought I hadn't seen anything but a glorification of violence and prejudice, it takes the whole film before you see the whole picture (pardon the pun), the grand concept that makes this film more than mere entertainment, it is art.08/10-x-",American History X

1153,spezboy22,I cannot believe my ears,8,29 October 2008,"Though I believed that the film was extremely well done, and very entertaining, I absolutely cannot believe that almost everyone on this page has failed to see its overall racist perspective. Let me explain.First off, this film gives an amazing amount of statistics, whether they be true or false, that support racism as a system, especially when regarding the black community. This would be acceptable if there was something to in fact balance this racism out. However, there is not. All the viewer is given is a bowl 5h!t story of how Derik is ""saved"" by a black man in jail. This is completely circumstantial, and leaves nothing but an unlikely story for the viewer, in addition to cold hard facts that support bigotry. I find this extremely offensive, in that there are dozens of reasons why racism is wrong, but how many reasons (facts) are given in the movie? None. Every slight attempt to oppose racism through debate is shot down, aside from Sweeny's questioning which is again circumstantial (has being a skinhead helped Derrrikk). Finally, the ending of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of being rewarded for change, Norton is given a deceased brother. Are we to believe that this does not rekindle racist thought for Derik? It takes years to erase bigotry, but only one incident to rekindle it. Though some may doubt this assumption, I have hard evidence to prove my point. One of the proposed endings of the film was supposed to replace Danny's conclusion speech, with further plot. The final scene takes place back at the Vinyard's. In this shot, Derik is pictured with a towel over his head, starring at his swastika in the mirror. After cutting to a shot of hair inside of his sink, the camera returns to Derik, where he removes the towel and reveals the ""unthinkable."" He is now a skinhead again. And why shouldn't he be? Death of a family member is what sparked up this train of thought, and why should this fail to continue. After all, violence is portrayed as a vicious circle in this film anyways. One final thing that may sway your opinion as to how American History X is in fact racist, not ""Liberating,"" is the quarrel behind the scenes; between Kaye and Norton. You can look this up yourself, but just keep in mind, i did not come to this conclusion out of nowhere. AHX is fricking racist, despite the intentions of many involved with it. Norton's charisma, coupled with the plot itself exploit this, and I hope some of you can get your head out of your azzes and try to think past the surface.",American History X

1155,tellsri_krishna-1,A brutal Edward Norton makes you sit up through this American history,9,13 December 2008,"It is a powerhouse performance by Edward Norton that drives this compelling drama to a whole new height. Mr. Norton plays “Derek” a Nazi skinhead ex-convict who tries to prevent his younger brother “Danny”, played astutely by Edward Furlong, from going down the same path. The movie is narrated by both these protagonists as plots and sub-plots get unfolded smoothly. The plot is relatively simple but it’s the natural ease with which all actors play their parts that ignites the story. Mr.Norton is absolutely convincing as the angry young man, furious at his social system and in the process gets caught up in his own ideologies.Scowling and scoffing at anyone who is non-white, Mr. Norton delivers a performance worthy of his Oscar nomination; a perfect foil to the timid “Narrator” of Fight club. The scene in which he grins at his brother as he gets arrested and then the shocking realization as he is dragged away from his family is a gem.The other actors including Edward Furlong have played their parts extremely well. The characters have been sketched extremely well and reflect the contemporary American society. Edward Furlong as “Danny” who worships his brother reminds a little of the spoiled child in T2-Judgement Day. Derek’s mom, the mentor “Mr.Sweeny” and even Mr. Norton’s friend in prison, all are memorable characters that do stick in your mind. The film does have flaws. I found the movie a little short for its social undertone, but that’s acceptable since the director did not want to delve too much into Derek’s past. But his transition from the brutal skinhead to the redeemed prisoner is not as developed as one might expect. This is where the movie could have gained more intensity. It is not really clear why Mr. Norton lands in trouble. As a result, this sequence alone comes out half baked; a very crucial under-development to the storyline. Typical of its genre, the redeemed man is not let off the hook that easily. We know life is going to come hard on Mr. Norton. The shattering climax was expected but not surrealistic. ""History X"" suffers from falling into stereotypes so characteristic of it's genre. Nevertheless, it is a hard hitting movie on racism and depicts the underlying tensions in an American neighborhood with absolute sincerity. However it’s the charismatic Mr. Norton who elevates this 'just another tale of redemption' into a cinematic masterpiece. The bottom line;racism is a cancer. You try hard to wipe it out; it reappears in some other way more lethal than ever before. Watch American History X for its greatness in its social message; Watch it for “Derek”. As a cinema goer you will be enthralled; as a human being you will be concerned.",American History X
1156,sully524,American History X,10,8 December 2008,"What has to happen to transform a committed member of a skin head gang into a person willing to die to free his family from his mistakes? In American History X (1998), rated R for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality, and nudity, the story focuses on Derek Vinyard as he struggles to overcome the hate taught to him by his father and friends. The movie has a powerful message that steers clear of becoming a clichéd story about everybody getting along. It is a very dark movie that deals with very powerful themes such as racism and hate and also the ability to overcome these feelings. While the movie can at times feel rushed it is overall a very good movie that shows the transformation of one man and his family.In this movie all of the characters look the part of skinheads and racists, with shaved heads and clothing bearing the pictures and slogans of hate. Derek has gone one step further than this; he has covered himself in tattoos of swastikas, SS lightning bolts, and other symbols of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie comes when Derek stands in front of the mirror after being released from prison and covers up the large swastika tattoo over his heart with his hand. Also when Derek is released from prison he also begins to let his hair grow out again, no longer keeping his head shaved, showing in one more way that he has changed and that he no longer agrees with the ideologies of the skinheads.The acting in this movie is excellent. Edward Norton played the character of Derek perfectly. In the flashbacks it was almost scary to watch him as he spewed racism and hate. You got the sense that this was real. In playing Danny, Edward Furlong also did a very good job, portraying the younger brother striving for his older brother's affection and respect extremely well. The rest of the supporting characters were also very well done, all the characters seemed believable and you never questioned whether the hate they had was real.While the movie has several small, mainly cosmetic flaws, it is still a very good movie with an inspiring plot line. It is a powerful movie of love and redemption.",American History X
1157,ccityd,arguably one of the best films ever made,10,9 December 2008,"Edward Norton stars as Derek Vinyard in American History X (1998); a gripping story of a man who leads a group of young white supremacists. After being released from jail for a brutal hate crime, Derek quickly tries to right the wrongs he's committed in his life before they affect the people he loves. Can Derek save the life of his younger brother Danny, headed down the same direction he has gone, while simultaneously trying to keep himself away from his past and the dangers that come along with it? Edward Norton and Edward Furlong star in this disturbing yet insightful story directed by Tony Kaye. Set in Venice Beach, Kaye shows us a suburban town which is quickly being filled with racial diversity. The tensions between characters are built slowly throughout but not slow enough to take you out of the film. We see this development in much of the movie's lighting techniques. Going from a bright beach town, to the dark backstreets, the movie is defined by Norton's brilliant portrayal of a troubled youth guided down the wrong path of lies and deception. The dialogue is powerful and deals with racism issues that are occurring in American society to this day. Tony Kaye and writer David McKenna are not afraid to push the limits of acceptable language to get their point across. The movie keeps viewers enticed throughout the entire length of the film. Most of the production keeps you on the edge of your seat with an anxious feeling waiting to see what will happen to the characters with whom you seem to gradually develop a connection. The music simply adds to the mood when we listen to orchestrated pieces which leave us with a sense of approaching danger. American History X is a well balanced film with Norton's strong character and his younger brother Danny's innocent yet brain-washed personality. While Furlong is not as convincing of an actor, his performance still has enough to get you lost within the movie. Though the R-rating should be a good enough indication, be aware that the dialogue may be somewhat offensive to some viewers, so it's best to have an open mind throughout the movie. At first, the writer makes you feel as if it is nothing more than a hate-filled movie with no point to the offensive racial slurs. We quickly learn the movie's moral value which overall is what makes the movie a must-see. Through half of the movie, we hear Danny provide narration in the form of an essay which he owes to his history teacher Dr. Sweeny who takes an interest in trying to help Danny and Derek realize the error of their ways. Through this paper we learn a lot about Danny's real emotions and thoughts about his life and the people in it. As Derek tells his story, Kaye uses a black and white display to show flashbacks in the life of Danny and Derek. Through the flashbacks, we slowly learn the reasoning behind the characters' actions and hatred towards other ethnicities. Another great element used are eye-level camera angles which give us a better sense of what is running through Derek's head as he delivers some of the most powerful speeches ever heard in a movie. The movie deserves a 5 out of 5 star rating overall for its portrayal of a racist young man who is only driven by pain and misunderstanding. Though the cinematography may be lacking quality as far as uniqueness goes, it's quickly made up for by one of Edward Norton's best performances of his career. For anyone who enjoys good moral values, the movie is an excellent way to explain how misunderstanding can lead to dire thoughts.",American History X

His racist shows with Oprah and all the rappers that sing about him. I like this movie because it shows both sides. Hate is growing on both sides and we aren't far from this growing.

With excellent narration and an important message, this movie describes the potential of every human being, and what the will to change can accomplish in a person and his environment.It depicts what a man's downfall can bring and how his own very will can change that man, and those he love, to the better. The movie's more direct message goes to show what pain and misery racial prejudice and hate can bring. There are some very violent scenes, but if these things are used in the right way, they just underline the power with which the movie delivers its message and I can truthfully state that in American History X, they do.",American History X
1160,crazyc-07,American History X was a great movie!!!!!,10,14 May 2009,"The movie American History X explains the life of a former neo-Nazi/ skinhead who is trying to keep his younger brother from becoming a racist and committing the same mistakes he did before he was sent to jail.Derek Vineyard, played by Edward Norton, is a very troubled young man whose father basically raised him to be violent and have hatred against other people of various ethnicities. After being imprisoned for murdering two black men, Derek finally notices that not just African Americans and Jews are to blame for everything that goes on in the world. When coming out of jail, Derek is determined to speak out to his younger brother Danny. Since looking up to his brother Derek was very important to him, Danny ended up following all of Derek's ideas and who other ethnicities are the problem in the world.The actors in the movie have done a very great job in portraying the characters. Edward Norton does a phenomenal job portraying the character Derek Vineyard in the movie. His emotional change from being a gang leader of a white supremacist to a man who is enlightened by good ideas and not using other ethnicities as scapegoats is very transitioning in the movie. Actor Avery Brooks also does an outstanding job playing Dr. Bob Sweeny a principal who enforces hard work into his students.The view and the scenery of the movie makes people feel like their part of what's going on the in the movie. There are also many intense scenes, but I rather not spoil it for people who are going to watch the movie. Although there is a lot of foul language, the movie is made in an impeccable and interesting way.I think that people should go ahead and rent this movie. It is a very great movie and people could learn from it. This would be a very go movie for people who like drama, action, and very intense conflicts. It can also be a lesson for younger viewers that using hatred and violence against people can't get you anywhere, so go ahead and watch the movie. You will be amazed.",American History X

1162,kebadatta,Not All Black and White,10,20 October 2009,"Tony Kaye's 1998 film, American History X is a powerful and intelligent look at the Neo-Nazi movement in North America, one man's struggle to escape the group he was involved with and prevent his younger brother from going down the same path he did. It is a phenomenally good film, staying in the viewer's mind long after the credits have rolled. The exceptional directing, music and acting are what make it so memorable.American History X is certainly not the first film to pull out the racism card, nor is it the first film to show change within its characters. It is, however, a story told in such a way that entertains, challenges and moves like no other. A lot can be learned from the story of Derek Vinyard; a man put through various circumstances, is filled with hate and later joins a Neo-Nazi group. Later on, he is imprisoned and despite his initial feelings, eventually befriends a black inmate who challenges his way of thinking. There is a lot that can be learned about humanity through this character, and the later scenes between Derek and Lamont (aforementioned black inmate) are hilarious and heart-warming.Another great thing about American History X is that it never seems overly preachy, but still manages to make its points clear to all those watching and keeps them totally entertained at the same time. Towards the end, the film does an excellent job of showing the negative effects of hate and violence, and how it can still come back to haunt you even after you may have changed.Despite all of the other great points about the film, if there was one thing that could be considered the highlight of American History X, it would have to be the acting. Edward Norton in particular is spectacular as Derek Vinyard. The fact that Norton lost the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role to Roberto Benigni is flabbergasting. Norton plays the role of Vinyard with ease, being totally believable first as the racist skin head filled with hate and later as a reformed man, desperate to redeem his wrongdoings and stop his brother from making the same mistakes that he did. His performance here is amazing, even topping his portrayal of the complex Narrator in 1999's Fight Club. Certain scenes, such as his arrest after the infamous ""curb stomp,"" leave you mesmerized, all thanks to his talent. Norton's performance in this film would have to be one of the finest examples of acting I have ever seen.Even if they do not compare to Norton's, the performances of the other actors and actresses in this film are nothing to be scoffed at. Edward Furlong does a great job as Derek's brother, Danny Vinyard. He is not as skillful as Norton, but still does a great job of portraying an influenced youth, as well as making it believable that his character could change his views with just a little help from Derek. You can really feel the love between these two brothers and the love that they feel for the rest of their family, which makes certain scenes all the more painful and moving.The actors playing Neo-Nazi characters do a great job as characters you love to hate. These kinds of characters are great when they are both written and played well, and they certainly are here. Stacy Keach is wonderful as the leader of Derek's Neo-Nazi group, Cameron Alexander. Cameron is a lying, cheating racist and Keach does a great job of making the character entertaining and frustrating. Ethan Suplee is always memorable in whatever he does, and American History X proves to be no exception. Seth Ryan is really just another ignorant Neo-Nazi bigot, but Suplee plays the roll in a way that makes the character very entertaining to watch. Faiuza Balk works well as Derek's Neo-Nazi girlfriend, Stacey, who is unopened to the idea of change. William Russ is also worthy of a mention, even if only appearing in one short scene as Derek and Danny's father. This scene is very significant though; as it explains the origins of Derek's hate, and Russ does an excellent job of portraying a man capable of making his son believe in such ideas and ideals. Guy Torry, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo and Jennifer Lien also deserve mentions for their performances.The atmosphere of this film is dark, helping to add emotion to the moving storyline. The use of black and white in flashback scenes is very atmospheric and useful towards helping us understand what happened when. The soundtrack by Anne Dudley is also very beautiful and adds emotion to many of the scenes, though none of the tracks used in the film are very memorable. Even after watching the film several times, it is unlikely that the audience would remember any of the melodies of the tracks. Though despite this, the music was very pleasant and fitted well with the film.American History X is an amazing film with a good, strong message. The acting, direction and general atmosphere is excellent. The ending is also spot-on, showing that hate does not help make anything better and will only come back to haunt you, making things worse for you and those close to you. It is an exceptional piece of work.",American History X

1164,bahome-653-854387,"Thought Provoking, Daring Film",9,5 February 2010,"Tony Kaye directed his first feature in ""American History X."" This film explores deep analysis into the cause of race hatred in the United States. He shows the viewers that different races can look at the same evidence, but draw entirely different answers. In a very shocking, violent, opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard, played wonderfully by Edward Furlong, runs to tell his neo-Nazi brother one evening that a gang of thugs are breaking into his car in front of the house. Derek gets his gun and with no caution shoots the young men in their tracks. Tried and found guilty, Derek is sent away for three (3) years in prison, where he gets a completely different outlook as he compares white-power prisoners with a black prisoner named Lamont, played by Guy Torry. The changes within Derek show the positive impact that Lamont has given to him. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a radical attitude, seems determined to follow in his big brother's footsteps. With his new skinhead haircut and eye movements, the viewers can witness the hate which is planted in Danny. After Danny writes a positive review of Adolph Hitler, high school principal Sweeney, puts Danny in a course called American History X and tells him to write a paper about his older brother, who was a past student of Sweeney's. This part is shown by flashbacks, with the movie illustrating Danny's account of Derek's life before the night of the shooting.The main themes that are shown in the movie are affirmative action and racism. The theme of affirmative action is mostly shown through the character of Derek's father. These themes are shown throughout the whole film.The performances of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are unbelievable. Edward Norton shows the ability to demonstrate the hatred and development of his character quite convincing. Edward Furlong plays the ""narrator"" and character of Danny. He also shows the development of his character.The story of ""American History X"" is healing and opens the mind that racism does happen and we never really see how damaging it can be to oneself and others. The film makes it point quite well and gives the message clearly. The director, Tony Kaye, refuses the movie to have a happy ending. With racism and the consequences of it, this kind of behavior can destroy family members for life (i.e. tragedy built from hate and ignorance).",American History X
1165,mcdona07,Violent film about a neo-Nazi gang leader,7,6 February 2010,"The story evolves around two brothers, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) growing up in Los Angeles. Derek becomes involved with a Neo-Nazi gang after his father who was a fireman is killed by a black man while putting out a fire. With an intense rage and hatred for other races and cultures Derek quickly rises through the ranks of the gang. Then one night three black gang members try to steal his pickup truck, but Derek is there to thwart the attempt and ends up brutally killing two of the gang members. Because of the killing Derek is sent away to prison for three years. While there Derek joins the other neo-Nazi inmates, but gets in a argument and is raped by his own gang members. Afterwards Derek is virtually alone except for his one friend Lamont (Guy Torry) a black co-worker in the laundry, who helps him stay safe for the rest of his sentence. After getting released from prison Derek comes home with a new view on race, but finds out that Danny has become very involved with the neo-Nazi gang. Derek is determined to get Danny out of the gang, but is too late when Danny is shot and killed by a black gang member. American History X tries to show the social problems that are being faced in the poorer neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Similar to Boyz-n the Hood (1991) it shows the violent environment of the inner city with gangs and racial tension. In both of these movies the main characters are intelligent young men who realize that they must get out of this environment before it is too late, and they end up getting killed. After getting in trouble for writing a paper on Mien Kaumf Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is instructed by the principal of his school Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) to write a paper about his brother Derek (Edward Norton) who was the leader of a neo-Nazi gang before being sent away for three years for murder. In telling the story the director Tony Kaye uses black and white film to show the flashback in time, and narration from Danny to help tell the story of Derek. The black and white filming helps the viewer in realizing what a flashback is and what is happening in the present. Additionally the black and white adds suspense to the film, and to provide an abstract look at Derek's evil past. The narration or voice over by Danny provides the viewer with a better understanding of what is going on in Derek's life when the flashback occurs.",American History X
1166,kuhn12,The director hits the social problem of racism head on and leaves us spellbound by the reality of his depiction.,7,6 February 2010,"In the movie American History X, directed by Tony Kaye, the audience learns from the story of two brothers the hardships and root of ignorant racial views. The tale is told from the narration of the misguided youngest brother Danny Vinyard, played by Edward Furlong. During the opening scene the audience gains a full appreciation of the limitless boundaries of racial prejudice and hate. Danny is awoken by two black men breaking into his brother's car so he goes to interrupts his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. As Derek tosses his girlfriend off of him we quickly learn his characters radical racial views. With a large swastika on the wall of his bedroom and tattooed to his chest, we realize he is the epitome of a neo-Nazi skinhead. From the anger of his father's death at the hands of a minority and the misguided teaching of his neo-Nazi mentor Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, Derek unleashes his rage on the two black gang-bangers ultimately landing him in prison for manslaughter. With his best friend and idol Derek in jail, Danny is destined to fall into his brothers footsteps, unless influenced by his principle Dr. Sweeney, played by Avery Brooks, who gives him an assignment of writing a paper on the events surrounding his recently released brother's incarceration. From the beginning of the movie, the director transitions from color to the black and white effectively to capture the significance and realization of Danny and Derek's memories. It is through the memories of Danny we learn about Derek's progression of violence toward minorities. During Danny's quest to fully understand his brother, whose view and opinions have changed since leaving jail, we learn from Derek firsthand about his time behind bars. This technique helps the audience gain a full appreciation of Derek's progression towards hate and his harsh time in prison because it does not glorify what is depicted on screen. During Derek's incarceration he finds out his follow skinheads aren't all that courageous and turns his back on them. For his disrespect they rape him violently in the shower and threaten his life. With no protection and everyone out to get him he forms an unlikely bond with a black inmate and seeks the guidance of his old teacher Dr. Sweeney. Once release from jail Derek begins his journey to leave behind his old ways and educate his younger brother. Although he travels the streets with the same paranoia from prison he may be too late to save Danny from meaningless racially motivated hate crimes. American History X is filmed with the subjective view point similar to that of Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood. The director puts you right into the emotions of the character as they struggle towards learning that their cause is an ignorant ambition. This technique allows us to see firsthand the intimacies of racism and prejudice as both brothers grow to understand the realities of their beliefs. The director hits the social problem of racism head on and leaves us spellbound by the reality of his depiction.",American History X

I watched it at his house, having never heard of it before. Now, I was blown away by Norton's performance in Primal Fear but I thought he outdid himself as Derek in American History XNow, I consider myself a great and avid lover of film today but at that time was only familiar with more commercial fare that studios throw tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars into. I just find it unfortunate that regardless of his Oscar nomination, the movie itself reportedly only grossed around $10 million at the box office, meaning it probably got a limited release. If I remember correctly, Scarface was also a bust at the box office. Also, this years Oscar winner for best picture (The Hurt Locker) only had a limited release in theaters and reportedly grossed the least amount in history for a best picture win at the Oscars.

1169,heather_hm2003,"Excellent movie, although very violent",9,1 August 2010,"American History X is a story about two brothers, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and a black drug dealer while fighting a fire in a neighborhood in Los Angeles murdered Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong), who fight racism after their father, who was a firefighter. Derek goes to prison for 3 years after brutally killing black gang members who he catches breaking into his families car. Daniel follows his brother's footstep until Derek gets out of prison and tries to stop Daniel from going down the same path. Derek finally gets Daniel on the right path and Daniel is dropped off at school where a black kid shoots him in the bathroom; a black kid that Daniel had confrontation with earlier in the film. The theme of the film is about racism. The family battles it after a black drug dealer killed their father. The movie focuses on problems and conflicts between the family and black people. There is a scene where Derek organizes a raid on a foreign owned grocery store. He organizes people to go into this store and raid it, tearing up the inside in the process and confronting the owners. In the beginning of the film Derek kills, black gang members after they are caught breaking into his family's car. He shots at them, then makes a man put his teeth on the curb, and kicks the back of his head. Derek is then arrested. Daniel follows Derek's footsteps and joins the white supremacist. While Derek is in jail, Dr. Sweeny (Avery Brooks) visits him and Avery convinces him that racism is pointless. Derek realizes that the only reason he stayed alive in prison was a black person that he became close friends with. Time in prison was life changing for Derek and he was determined to change the family's lives when he got out. Derek and Daniel were committed to a better lifestyle without racism when Derek drops Daniel off a school Daniel goes into the bathroom and is confronted by a black boy from the previous day. They look each other in the eye and Daniel is shot to death right in the bathroom. American History X and Crash are identical in theme and plot. They both are about people who are racist in the beginning but then open up by the end of the movie. Both of these movies start out harsh in relevance to racism and by the end, all people are getting along. The lighting and color choice were very appropriate for this film. The film went from color to black and white, which was appropriate for the scenes they were showing. For example, the scene where Derek shots the gang members is black and white and I think it added feeling and dramatization to the scene. The color scenes were not overly bright which sets the mood for the film and how Derek's family is unhappy and racist. The lighting was not very bright and was dull throughout the movie. Both the lighting and color choice set the mood and tone of the entire movie. The motif in this film was the swastika as it was portrayed throughout the film. It was tattooed on Derek's chest, it was on posters in Derek and Daniel's room and it was seen many times throughout the movie. This shows or proves that the movie is about racism and white supremacists. This symbol was a fit for the theme of the movie and it was evident when they were taking there posters down that they were going to attempt a better life and a life without racism in it. This was an excellent movie and I enjoyed it however, I feel that it was very violent and should not be viewed by everyone. Not every individual can handle this film because of the graphic nature and the extent of the violence and the language. I think that everything was needed to get the theme across but once again; I would not recommend this movie to everyone especially if you are easily offended.",American History X

This guy Derrek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, has a younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong, who is basically going down the same road as Derrek did before jail. Derrek tries to prevent this from happening. Derek's deviant behavior had great influence on his little brother. Derrek was the leader of a gang of white supremacists in which committed racial crimes. Derrek's reason for going to prison was for killing three guys who tried to steal his truck in his yard. Oh, not to mention, the 3 guys were black. This film shows that no matter what a person has done in their past, change and forgiveness is possible. This film's story is told through Danny in the form of a paper through use of flashbacks. The purpose of this was because Danny wrote a paper for class that was not approved and Dr. Sweeny, played by Avery Brooks, made him rewrite the paper. This paper was to be about his brother's life. The editor's use of flashbacks and montages make this a film to be seen. The use of sound effects and customs are very effective and helps the film become real. The up close angles and the flashbacks encourage the viewing to be on edge and on point. This is a must see movie. The superb acting and the music behind each scene makes this movie of racial crime and reformation a must see movie.

1173,kish04,American History X is a film that both glorifies and humanizes racism.,7,12 December 2010,"Released In: 1998 Main Characters: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard (Edward Furlong), Murray (Elliott Gould), Dr. Sweeny (Avery Brooks)American History X is a film that both glorifies and humanizes racism. Derek Vinyard, Danny Vinyard's older brother was in the neo-Nazi ""movement"" due to past experiences with the loss of his father. Derek's father was firefighter who was killed trying to protect others, protecting an African American home and lost his life. This in sighted a rage in Derek, therefore affecting his entire family. This rage affected Derek's thought process and he felt as if he was doing what was right in society. Derek ended up going to prison and serving time for his outrageous acts. This is when Derek came to see the error of his ways. Derek met an African American, who befriended him in prison. This man allowed Derek to see things a little differently. Derek then returned home, hoped to change the ways that he had established within his family, with this return; he found the complete opposite. American History X has an overall theme of something everyone can relate to, making amends for past transgressions; more specifically the love of two brothers and the care for they have for one another. Another major theme that many people see within this film is racism. Racism is a major concern. Derek was the leader of the racist side within his community before his imprisonment. Derek influences many of his followers throughout this film. His followers were dissolution impressionable youths with weak family ties, had few friends, and needed to be a part of something. Danny, Derek's brother was one of the many who were affected by this strong organizer. This system appeared to be organized and was something that many were doing. However when Derek was imprisoned he had the capabilities to see African Americans as humans beings versus vicious animals. By doing this, his impression changed completely. Derek wanted nothing more for his brother to see the other side. Derek tired immensely to change Danny, however struggled. Danny began to see the truth in Derek's ways, Danny's heart and mind were changing. Danny tried to make amends with the African American boys in his school. Danny was strong minded, however not as strong minded as the African Americans. They were still acting out in rage like both Derek and Danny used to. In the end, Danny was murdered. Danny was killed by the African American, who was raised just like Danny. This African American boy did not and was not ready to make amends and see that all are equal. The theme of American History X can directly relate to the movie ""Crash"". Both of these films have a great deal of racism. Along with racism, making amends for past transgressions. The angle and lighting immensely relate to the theme of American History X. The film is shot in black and white that clearly conveyed one of the main themes racial tensions between blacks and whites. There are several scenes where the camera angle also conveys the theme; when Derek speaks throughout the film they focused on the swastika on his chest; he was proud to show it. In contrast in prison he was not, he became ashamed. In conclusion, the efforts glorify the racist movement failed. Derek saw the humanity in his prison friends. Derek began to have an understanding and love for many people; with his change in heart, he hoped to influence others.",American History X
1174,elatedbyu,"Capacity to change, racial issues, social injustices",7,18 December 2010,"Danny Vinyard played by Edward Furlong was a teenage boy who submitted an essay paper in class declaring his opinion of praise on the book Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. The teacher whom Danny submitted the paper to was Jewish. The principle summoned Danny in for a meeting telling him he is going to redo his assignment but with a different objective and twenty four hours to do it in. The task is a full essay on how his life has been shaped by the events that have taken place including the events that took place to land his brother Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton in prison. The day Danny met with principle and assigned his new objective was the day that Derek is released from prison. Derek became very involved in a white supremacist group and his hatred for humans with color was intense. One night Derek's vehicle was being broken in to and he goes out and catches the guys, he killed themhe went to prison. While in prison Derek's job paired him with a black man and over time they become close and Derek changes. Derek's change is the prime example to the prominent theme of the moviethe capacity of oneself to change. The movie deals with the life of Danny and Derek Vinyard and some crucial issues that deal with racism and social injustices. The themes of the movie are the ability to change yourself, racism issues, and social injustices. The motif and symbols seen throughout the movie were very relevant to the theme. The Mein Kampf, the posters, and the tattoos were all relevant to the theme of the movie. The dialogue to the movie was very appropriate and stayed right in line with the themes. The movie American History X was a great movie that dealt this issues that always seem to be issues at least in the past and present the issue of racism and social injustices have always been a problem and could be a problem in the future. I like how this movie showed the hatred, anger, and violence within a family and within the society but this movie showed all the gritty details and scenes that were full of hate but it also showed the consequences of decisions and the light at the end of the dark tunnel.",American History X

1176,ulbric01,Life is more than black and white.,10,5 February 2011,"All is not well down by the beach. Local teenager and Venice Beach High School student Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is on the same slippery slope his older brother, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), was on. After their fire fighter father, Dennis (William Russ), was murdered while putting out a blaze at a known drug den, young Derek was molded and guided by Cameron Alexander (Stacie Keach), a local white supremacist. Derek became the charismatic leader of the local neo-Nazi gang, the DOC. Here he recruited the scared and disenfranchised white kids in the neighborhood who were tired of living in fear of the growing local minority dominate gangs. Now, Derek has just been released from prison after serving time for the murder of 2 black, local gang members, who were trying to steal his car. As an older, wiser Derek emerges from prison, has he been released in time to save his family from the wide reaching grip of violence and racial tensions created by his own rhetoric? Director Tony Kaye's use of color wasn't to just simply help the viewer understand scenes that take place in the present and scenes that happen in the past. The motive of color goes deeper, as the present day scenes of color show us how Derek now views the world, with all its color and diversity. This is a stark contrast from the Derek of the past, whose view was much narrower and he saw the world as simple as black and white. Also, the use of low-key lighting during the past and the racially charged scene shows the clouded views of hate that Derek and others have of their surrounding world. Racially charged films show how their characters justify their hate. Much like Clint Eastwood's film, Gran Torino, the main character, Walt, drew his hatred for minorities from his war experiences. In American History X, Derek's hate was driven, in most part, by the senseless murder of his father (Morrissey & Kaye, 1998). This racially charged film shows that the world we live in isn't as simple as black and white.",American History X
1177,veruka_jade,Amazing Movie,10,6 February 2011,"American History X is an enlightening film about race, violence, and learning acceptance. Edward Norton gives a phenomenal performance as Derek Vineyard, an influential white supremacist. This is not a role I would imagine for Norton, but he makes the character completely believable. Edward Furlong plays the perfect struggling teen, Danny Vineyard, who is trying to find himself and fit-in at the same time. Derek is sent to prison for murder, while Danny is left behind to follow in Derek's footsteps. Derek learns a great deal about people and stereotypes during his three year incarceration. He eventually wishes a different life for Danny. With the help of one of his former teachers, he realizes that nothing he has done as the leader of his skinhead crew has made his life better. Instead of finding solutions to problems, he had been perpetuating a cycle of violence.This movie gives viewers a detailed look at racism and prejudice in our country. There is great use of flashbacks, shown in black and white, to provide a glimpse of how things came to be the way they are. The opening flashback scene was very powerful, giving an understanding of Derek's pride and his importance to Danny. Narration by Danny is also instrumental in letting the audience have an inside look at the Vineyard family. He looks up to his older brother and has seen some truth in Derek's views.This movie shares some common characteristics with the film Gran Torino. Both movies are led by racists white men who seem to make no exceptions when it comes to their hatred of minority races. It takes the development of a personal relationship with someone of color to make the men reconsider their preconceived notions. Derek comes to befriend his black coworker in prison. He realizes that it is not race that makes a person good or bad, and he learns that injustices do exist for minorities in our society.The end of the film is ironic but depressing. After Derek shares his epiphany with his younger brother, the violent cycle continues. Danny is shot and killed by a young black boy who used to be a target of Danny's hatred. Just when Danny may have been able to see the boy with different eyes, his chance is taken away. Derek blames himself for being such a strong influence in Danny's life. He can take his life in a new direction, but he can't change what has already been done.",American History X
1178,gregorenee,"One of the major themes of this film is race relations, and racism",9,7 February 2011,"The film American History X was released in 1998 by director Tony Kaye. One of the major themes of this film is race relations, and racism. The film is based on how races relate and how people see things the way they want when they are hurt by people of a certain race. In the film Derek Vinyard played by Edward Norton is very frustrated about life and the fact that a black man took his father away from him by murdering him in cold blood. Derek could never get over it, and he wanted revenge. Derek is sent to prison for killing two black men who tried to steal his vehicle.When Derek is released from prison after serving 3 years in prison he is changed his outlook about racism, but for Derek he will have to face it again, and through his younger brother Danny who is played by Edward Furlong a young lost soul who is following in his brothers footsteps. The film is very intense and very graphic you are able to see the way white supremacist act against other races.The film shows black and white scenes which represents Derek's pass and how he ends up where he is in life. It helps bring life and understanding to the film. The lightning in the film is both high and low depending on the scene of the film. The low key lightning is used to show dark and evil hatred that the white supremacist has against other races.This film can also be compared to the film Higher Learning which is also about racism and race relations. American History X is a must see film it is the sociological imagination of a white male who has reacted in a very negative way due to his past.",American History X

It is hard to believe that within a couple of hours, Edward Norton could turn from a skinhead killer into a noble big brother to Edward Furlong who also showed his abilities in this movie.

Everyone Should See This,9,28 April 2011,"It's amazing when I hear people say they didn't like this movie - one, no one ever says that, and two, it's a cinematic masterpiece if I've ever seen one. Everything flows together in a way that only the Scorceses and Spielbergs can pull off. I really felt connections to the characters as they developed, something that has been all but lost in modern filmmaking. Derek Vinyard's life is chronicled in such a way that you can almost draw parallels to your own; I thought about all of the things I've done that hurt other people, which in comparison were hardly that bad, of course, but the fact that even someone as evil and brainwashed as himself can be redeemed and be a small instrument of what is good about humanity is enlightening, if not humbling.Detractors of the film claim that his transformation is too extreme to be taken seriously, a product of amateur screen writing and a false sense of morality, but I argue just the opposite. No matter how far someone has fallen, there is always a glimmer of hope, and sometimes it just takes a new form of stimuli for them to realize it.",American History X

1185,maag06,"Life is short, so why waste it on an emotion like hatred.",8,14 June 2011,"The 1998 film American History X is about a family that is torn apart by the roots of race hatred within America. This story focuses on Danny Vinyard (Edward Fulong) who is in a white supremacist group which his brother Derek (Edward Norton) had once led. In the movie, Danny had written an English paper on Mein Kampf and now has to redo the paper and write about Derek. He has to analyze and interpret the events that had surrounded Derek's incarceration and how it had impacted his view on life and his family. Through Danny's writing the audience learns that Derek was the leader of the group and had committed crimes of a racial nature throughout Los Angeles. Now, Derek had just finished serving a three year jail sentence for manslaughter, for when he shot, killed, and curb stomped some African American youths for stealing his father's truck. Throughout the story, as Danny writes his paper, he reflects on all the events that had led up to Derek's arrest. Such as the trashing of Archie's Ranch Market, the violence at dinner, and the treatment of his family. However, what Danny does not understand is that during Derek's time in prison he had made friends with an African American named Lamont (Guy Torry), and had acquired a new outlook on life. Danny does eventually learn of Derek's new found look on life and in turn he too decides to leave the cult behind in search for something better not only for him but for his family.This movie had been brilliantly presented by the director Tony Kaye. Through the black and white flashbacks accessible throughout the story, the audience really gets to focus in on what is happening during the scenes, and are able to achieve a deeper sense of depth to the story. The lighting and angles used also had improved the visual perspective, which coupled with the use of the development of the characters to convey the message had greatly enhanced the movie as a whole. In the end, what the viewers are to take away from this movie is the fact that even though the story did not preach about it directly, it is about racism and the hatred that is created from it. The movie is closely related to another movie called In the Heat of the Night which also carries the themes of racism and murder. People should not allow the hatred to consume their lives and essentially destroy not only themselves but also their family. Life is short, so why waste it on an emotion like hatred.",American History X

If you want adventure and false feelings and fantasy, yes, you can enjoy Braveheart or any other movie, but if you in any way want to see a movie that tells about the human nature, this is it.I think that 10 is not enough for this film. It has the same ingenious daily atmosphere as Tarantino's Reservoir dogs, even though Tarantino is about pure violence while this.. this is so true and so bad. How can you describe better the stupidity of misled young people. How can you describe better the look on a mans face when he realizes that there is nothing he can say to make these young men understand that they are wrong?The actors and directing just makes me weak. Edvard Norton is one of the very best actors I have ever seen, and this is definitely his best performance so far. There is not even a one bad actor in this film.This is not just about neo-nazism, this is about violence in family, about love, stupidity, ignorance, repent.

The cast is great as well, Edward Norton plays his best performance I have ever seen since Fight Club and this may be the best acting of his career. Edward Furlong was also great and was the best child performance of 1998 and he did an amazing job. American History X is one of my favorite films of all time.

1191,singerbird,A Beautiful and Important film,10,21 January 2012,"I watched 'American History X' at a time in my life when I was thinking deeply about all the facets of racism and how it arises from the environments we are born into. I'm happy to say his film not only confirmed my own thoughts on these subjects but gave me even more insight into this worldwide problem. Being a white female who is probably still quite naive about racism because none of it ever comes my way, I am glad about the things I learned from this film. I find it interesting (and depressing) how so many movies and TV shows out there seem to glorify this idea of 'retribution' or vigilantism; the idea that one is not only righteous in murdering someone who has wronged them/harmed their family, but they gain respect from their peers (or those viewing the film)for doing so. Until I watched American History X I was yet to find a film that glorified forgiveness and change. For most of my life, I myself did not understand the concept of forgiveness, and unquestioningly believed in things like capital punishment, like many others around me (thankfully, I don't anymore!) What I love and relate to in this film is that it illustrates that every person, even those furtherest into their own beliefs, can change, and should be given the chance to do so. Some may say that the ending is cliché, but honestly I think when it comes to films with a message like this one, such observations are irrelevant and mundane. The ending was vital to the overall point of the film because it serves as a warning. At the risk of sounding cliché myself, the end of this film warns us not to carry on the cycle of violence, but to forgive, and let people change. It's called evolution :)",American History X
1192,lexusmarie06,Summary,9,1 December 2011,"American History X is a 1998 drama film directed by Tony Kaye, starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. The film tells the story of two brothers, Derek Vinyard and Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard from Venice Beach in Los Angeles, California. They are both smart and charismatic boys. Their father, who was formally a firefighter, was murdered by a black drug dealer while trying to fight a fire in a South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Derek is drawn into this whole neo-Nazi movement. In the movie older brother Derek kills two black gang members who he catches in the act of breaking into the truck left to him by his father, and is sentenced to three years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. The story shows how Danny is influenced by his older brother's actions and mindset and how Derek, now suddenly changed by his experience in prison, which includes a violent rape scene by white inmates.This is a very controversial film and is bound to spark up a ton of conversation.

The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly Edward Norton is truly fantastic in his role. He is very well believable as a Neo-Nazi as well as the reformed person he later turns into in the movie. It's almost like he's playing 2 different characters and he does that so extremely well. Also really good was Edward Furlong who we all long had not seen in a big production. Furlong and Norton are both acting well together in their scene's are highly believable as two brothers.Although the film contains a constant strong theme of violence, it is always justified in portraying a picture of racial tension.

1196,ChrisBlackbird,Stunning movie,9,28 February 2014,"The beginning was intriguing, middle kinda drowned it with Edward's temperament arguing with the family. The biggest thing about the movie is the sad end. Anyhow loved how the actors played. White ""bigotry,"" either in a current or historical context, is a favourite Hollywood theme. The films they churn out frequently portray society as ""dominated"" by a cruel caste of Whites who are grotesquely unfair towards minorities. These ""victimized"" minorities are presented as tolerant, open, understanding, calm, gentle and virtuous. In contrast, Whites are portrayed as brutally insensitive, oppressive, intolerant, hateful, violent, greedy, narrow-minded and destructive. These films show how the mean spiritedness of White Gentiles deeply hurts angelic minorities, who are at a loss to understand such raw hatred. Frequently, they feature a benevolent minority with tremendous patience and moral conviction who seeks to exorcise the poisonous racism demonstrated by the White characters (the very preachy Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Sydney Poitier is a shining example). The hypocrisy of reinforcing such crude racial stereotypes, when the prime message of these preachy films is that stereotypes should be eliminated, is seemingly lost on those who make them. The twisting of reality in the service of a ""progressive"" cause. a controversial essay near the beginning. The portrayal of White people as gullible and easily manipulated by ""misinformation"" promulgated by charismatic ""bigots."" A main character who, through deception, is rapidly transformed from being naive and innocent into a prominent neo-nazi/skinhead activist. A reversal and atonement for this neo-nazi/skinhead association. A link, or continuum, established between well-articulated and justifiable White racial frustration and neo-Nazism/skinhead-ism. Crude attempts to shock the audience with exaggerated scenes involving violent Whites who batter, kill and/or severely abuse minorities. Questions raised and dropped, which if stressed, would have made the story more true-to-life and insightful.",American History X

I'd like to know, but I guess it keeps the audience on a slight cliff hanger. It's just annoying that he basically died for his brother. I thought that the slow motion shots in the film were good and the use of black and white photography on different shots was interesting, however sometimes I felt it was done too much in the film, that I noticed it.

After the death of his father by a black drug-dealer, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) finds himself proactive in a Neo-Nazi gang led by Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) and right next to him is his girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk). One evening Derek's younger brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) alerts Derek that some black guys were trying to break into his vehicle. Derek darts outside shooting a gun, killing one of them and forcing another to ""bite the curb"" where he kills him as well. As Danny looks on, his brother is arrested, charged, and sentenced to three years in prison. Derek learns in prison that he was wrong in believing and acting the way he did when he leaves the safety of the gang in prison he joined and befriended a black man Lamont (Guy Torry). Danny is following in his brother's footsteps by: joining the same gang, writing papers such as Mein Kampf, and openly being a skinhead, Neo-Nazi supremacist. Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) from Danny's school visits Derek in prison to inform him that Danny is following in his footsteps. When Derek gets out of prison, he tries everything he can to reach out to Danny to make his see what he did was wrong and it's not something to be proud of. Once he gets through to Danny and they both vow to stay away from that kind of evil, Danny gets killed in the bathroom by a black man he had an argument with earlier in the film. The theme of this film is the ability to change oneself. Throughout the film there are flashbacks from Danny's point of view as well as Derek's when he is in prison. The story shows how events that happen in a person's life can ultimately change how they view themselves enough to change who they are when they realize that reflection they are looking at every day is not the person they want to be. With the theme in mind another film that I feel shows how people can change and view life in a different was is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" where two men who are in prison for different crimes learn that friendship and kindness can make life so much more worthwhile. The lighting, color, and angles used throughout the film helped to captivate the audience. When there were flashbacks the use of black and white was amazing to show the overall difference between past and present. The angle used when Derek was being arrested was to make sure the audience not only saw the outcome, but ultimately see the expression on Derek's face when he was looking at Danny and smiling. That was the last memory Danny had of him outside of prison. When addressing the theme on changing oneself, sometimes it takes a person to step back and look at how things were when there was happiness and innocence. One scene was where Derek is looking in the mirror and thinks about when he and Danny were very young. To that point he realizes how much pain he has caused many people around him, and what needs to be done in hopes to fix what he continued from the hatred his father taught him.",American History X

1203,noel-fredericks-318-299913,American History X is a film about the negativity and worthlessness of hatred and racism.,9,15 March 2012,"American History X is a film about the negativity and worthlessness of hatred and racism.Edward Norton who plays Derek, the proclaimed leader of a Neo-Nazi Skinhead gang in Los Angeles during the racially fueled time period of the Rodney King Trail, attempts to free himself and his family from the empire he has helped to create, after his release from prison. Derek's imprisonment which was caused by his role in the murder of two African Americans who were attempting to steal his vehicle yields him three years behind bars on manslaughter charges.Danny played by Edward Furlong, is Derek's younger brother who idolizes Derek after the death of their father. Caught in the same racist thinking traps, the film captures his racially fueled dialog and dramatic scenes to highlight the uncomfortable interactions he has with other races. Naturally Danny starts to grow closer to Derek's friends while he is in prison and begins to get noticed by the watchful eye of Cameron played Stacy Keach. Cameron, whose original vision helped Derek to organize and form the gang he led, is trying to recruit Danny through verbal manipulation in an effort to continue growing the organization.In the film the director uses a technique of switching from black and white to color as a way to delineate between past and present, while dramatizing the scene. As the film progresses, we notice Derek experience a great transformation away from racism, through the unlikely pairing of an African American prisoner (Lamont) played by Guy Torry, when they are both assigned to the same work detail. During the course of Derek's transformation he starts to understand that his chosen path only leads to destruction and the demise of his family. Faced with these new challenges upon release, Derek has to figure out how best to get his life back together along with his family. Derek comes home to less than optimal living conditions while mother, Doris played by Beverly D'Angelo is ill and can't afford to care for the family. Derek notices the toll his choices have taken on his family, more enlightened, Derek want nothing but a better life for his family to include his younger brother who is dangerously close to following wrong crowd, which leads to Derek's attempt to convince Cameron to leave him and his family alone.",American History X
1204,shamrockman247,American History X,7,16 March 2012,"American History X is a movie which follows the life of a Neo-Nazi skinhead Derek Vinyard (Ed Norton) that develops a hatred for any race other than his own. He soon finds himself in prison for killing two black men caught breaking into his truck. During his prison time, he begins to question his prejudices as he makes friends with a black man named Lamont (Guy Torry). Once released from prison, he dedicates himself to convincing his younger brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) that being a part of a supremacist group is wrong. The story attempts to show how being a part of a supremacist group can brainwash someone into unbelievable hatred for a person based on their color of skin. The unbelievable change that Derek makes in prison is hard to accept from his friends and family. He is soon cast out of the group and finds himself alone. Danny is described as a brilliant teenager that has been led down the wrong path in life. The principle in the school, Dr. Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) takes it upon himself to attempt to identify why Danny feels the way he does. Before Danny is able to show that he is changing, a tragic event unfolds. This movie has a strange similarity to the film Gran Torino. Both movies touch on a specific person that has years of hatred and prejudice for other races. The relationships developed from both main characters to people of other races shows that feelings can be changed and friendships made. In each of these movies, death represents what the cost of prejudice can be. Main characters in each of these movies die as a result of an unfortunate hatred. There were recurring ideas (motifs) throughout both movies. The indescribable prejudice that one person can have and their ability to see what is right and overcome that feeling. Many close up angles throughout the films attempt to show emotion and feeling without necessarily having dialogue. In American History X, there were many ""skinheads"" that displayed Nazi symbols in the form of tattoos and flags to represent their outspoken prejudices. In Gran Torino, the constant derogatory language that was used displayed the same emotion. American History X was an interesting look at a life many people do not live. The ability to understand why someone would have such hatred is shown in a way that the viewer would relate to. The underlying theme is the ability to overcome a life of hatred and see that we are all created equal.",American History X
1205,gary-j-duncan,American History X can bring the best of us to tears,9,12 April 2004,"Be warned! Anyone who begins to watch this film without the open mind that is needed, risks the chance of disliking what is probably the most powerful movie they may ever see. Indeed this film is not for the faint hearted, who will turn away at the first sign of obscenity. Nor is it for the narrow-minded ones amongst us, who will never appreciate the greatness this film has to offer. ""Hate is baggage"", arguably the most meaningful message brought to us in this film through the outstanding performances of Edward Norton (Derek Vineyard)and Edward Furlong (his brother- Danny). Danny is a young but intellectual English student at high school but also an apprentice of the local racist leader Cameron Alexander (Stacey Keach). Derek, a major figure in the ""White Power"" movement is the murderer of two black would-be robbers and the influential role model of his baby brother. The plot begins to unfold when Derek is released from prison after serving his time. Apparently transformed whilst inside, on his release he is devastated to learn that Danny has adopted his brothers wicked neo-Nazi ways. It is now Derek's duty as the older brother to alter the strong and narrow opinions that Danny has before something drastic is allowed to happen. The brutality, language, sexuality and heavy cultural influence are all appropriate if not necessary in bringing across the overall message of this film as one of positive redemption.A truly marvellous experience, two thumbs up!",American History X

I almost believed that the tears at the end where real.The other actors is also brilliant, you can really see the hate in thier eyes when they do ""that sign"" with their hands.At the beggining I didnt really understand what the film was going to be about, but that questions is quickly removed by the makers of the film. What I also like about this film is that the film-makers rely on the audience, that they understand the film (wich is quite easy, but still). They never say straight out that rasism is bad, they let the audience ""figure"" it out.And still the film has an unexpected twist at the end, that will make even the most cold-hearted person cry.",American History X

It really knows how to pull at the heartstrings too. I felt myself tearing up at a couple of parts. This is also due to the wonderful performances from the entire cast especially by Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. Although it has many positives aspects to it, for some people the language used and the brutality of some of the scenes may be a bit too much for some people to handle. So I can see why some people may not like it. In conclusion I thought American History X was a fantastic movie and a must see for film lovers. 9.5/10",American History X
1208,hylton05,Racism or redemption,7,17 June 2012,"In American History X, Derek Vineyard (played by Edward Norton) is a self proclaimed Neo-Nazi (skin head) and a leader of a gang, fostered by a preacher of hate, Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach). Alexander, who uses impressionable kids but stays behind the scenes to keep himself out of trouble, teaches hatred of anyone that is a minority and further pushes Derek into believing in white supremacy and uses Derek's skills and intelligence to help spread his word of hate. Thanks to his intelligence and skills in speaking, others follow Derek in terrorizing anyone who is not white as shown when Derek and other skinheads go into the Korean grocery store. Derek's first hint of racism came from his father, who was killed in the line of duty by a minority. This is where Derek began to have hatred for all minorities and was able to be easily influenced by the likes of Alexander. Derek has a younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) that idolizes him and wants to emulate him, and his mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo) and sister Davin (Jennifer Lien) who both are afraid of Derek but are also afraid of the life he has chosen and where that choice will take him. This theme of violence is not unlike the one shown by the Hmong gang that was terrorizing the community in Detroit in the film Gran Torino (Eastwood, 2008). After Derek was sentenced to prison for happily murdering two black youths that was breaking into his vehicle, things for Derek changed. While serving his sentence, he learned that there are good and bad people of every race and his view of others unlike himself have changed. Upon his release from prison, Derek must pull his younger brother from the mire of hatred that he once embraced. This feeling of hate and racism is one of the primary themes in the movie, and the easiest for the viewer to understand. Racism and hatred are both powerfully shown in this film but it ends with the enlightenment of Derek that what he has done in the past, and where his brother Danny is heading in the future, is wrong. There were many techniques used to show the power of the scenes. From using flashbacks to show what happened in the past to change Derek both negatively and positively, and the narration of the film by Danny, it all helped to tell the story the director wished the viewer to see. Plot points that supported the theme of violence and racism included the symbol of the Nazi swastika on Derek's chest. In the beginning, he wore that tattoo with pride but after maturing and becoming enlightened in prison, he wore it with shame. Camera angles were such that fear of the gang was shown by those that were terrorized by them and probably one of the most powerful was showing the violence of Derek killing the two men. American History X shows that there are consequences to the actions one takes and that enlightenment comes at a cost. For Derek, that cost was the time he spent in prison and what happened to him there.",American History X
1209,AlexWannaBeBee,"Released on parole after murdering two black men, a neo-Nazi attempts to reform.",10,28 February 2015,"American History X is a fine film, which has at its dark centre a towering performance that establishes Edward Norton as the most promising character actor of his generation.Told through the eyes of his admiring brother (a perfectly cast Furlong), American History X charts the rise, if that's the right word, of Derek Vinyard (Norton) a fiercely intelligent young man who, after the shooting of his father by a black man, and encouraged by sinister good ol' boy Cameron (Stacy Keach), shaves his head, has a swastika tattooed on his chest and proceeds to galvanise the local disenchanted youth into forming a racist gang before murdering two black men who were attempting to steal his car. When Derek returns on parole after three years of his sentence, his brother David (Furlong), whose doe-eyed puppyish looks bely his own gestating violent racism, is horrified to find that his brother has been reformed in jail and has not only grown back his mane but is determined to redress some of the harm he has done. Which is not a policy popular with his gang, which has gathered to welcome him back as a conquering hero.Neo-Nazidom has a short though distinguished history on the big screen. Alan Clarke's Made In Britain and Australian director Geoffrey Wright's Romper Stomper both took an uncomfortable look inside the heads of racist thugs. Yet American History X's strength is not its subject matter but Edward Norton's ballistic performance. Despite a weak backstory (Derek's rage apparently having its genesis in childhood after a few bigoted comments uttered by his dad, while his equally implausible moral reversal comes from ""meeting a nice black fella"" in jail), Norton manages to deliver one of the most convincing racists ever while retaining his character's humanity. Even after he kills - and in doing so commits to celluloid one of the most sadistically shocking acts of violence in the medium's history (if, that is, all the footage of this pre-release cut survives the attentions of the BBFC) - Norton manages to preserve the shred of humanity that carries us through his redemption and prevents us from simply dismissing him as worthless scum.Kaye's direction occasionally veers a little too close to his advertising roots; extensive use of slo-mo - particularly, for some reason, in showers that begin to resemble shampoo ads - and black- and-white lend a chic patina, which some may think is a little overcooked. And, in between set pieces, he flounders slightly, though this may be a symptom of the re-edit. Another may be the ending, in which Kaye seems to lose faith with the power of his own movie and delivers what could be seen as a cheap twist in place of a considered conclusion.But in themselves the set pieces are astonishing. A brutal attack on a convenience store, a gruelling prison rape sequence, and a dinner party argument that erupts into violence are all edited with sustained barnstorming energy.",American History X

1214,patton16,The journey of one white supremacists through some life-changing events and the impact they have on his life and those around him.,8,10 September 2012,"American History X is a film that brings out the ugly side of prejudice and white supremacy. The name of the film comes from Danny's principal who asks him to write a paper on his brother Derek's lifestyle as a white supremacist. Derek is the gang leader of the supremacist group in his town and always seems proud to show off the swastika tattoo on his chest.I believe the theme of this film is how racism and white supremacy affect a society and how people can change their views by learning more about one another. For Derek, this change does not come easy, and as you find out at the end of the film, it does not come in time either.In the beginning of the film you see Derek killing several colored men who are breaking into his vehicle in the middle of the night. Derek is arrested and forced to serve time in prison. There he quickly finds others that believe and follow the white supremacy beliefs. He believes this group can help protect him from the black and Hispanic prisoners. He later finds out that this group is actually ""paying"" a colored group to keep them safe and he decides he does not want anything to do with them. The white group feels betrayed by him and becomes even more furious when he begins chatting with a colored man. This man is Lamont, who Derek works in the laundry room with at the prison. The white group ends up raping Derek the shower room. This is a real turning point for Derek as he is shamed by his own kind. He realizes the white supremacy beliefs are not the way he wants to continue to live his life.Derek ends up leaving jail as a new man, with new beliefs, but in the same world as he left it. He sees his brother, Danny, following in his footsteps and treating the colored folks in town the same way he used to. Derek is finally able to change his brother's views after he shares all he experienced in prison. Unfortunately, it is too late as Danny is shot at the end of the movie by a colored man in a restroom.One film American History X reminds me of is Once Upon a Time in America. This film is similar in the fact that a ganger is forced to return to an old life he had years ago and deal with the issues he left behind. This is similar to what Derek went through upon his release from jail.A couple of film techniques stood out to me while viewing this film. The first was black and white vs. color. The film was shot in color with the exception of many scenes which flashed back to different times in Derek's life. All of the bad memories were done in black and white, but the one happy scene at the end remained in color. This one flashback in color was of Derek and Danny running on the beach playing as young boys. The use of black and white in this film makes all the bad memories on Derek's life stand out.The other notable technique used in this film was the use of symbols. The large swastika tattooed on Derek's chest was a mark of white supremacy. This was shown in many scenes throughout the movie when he wanted to show the world his position on racism. At the end of the film, after he has changed his views, you see him touching and looking at it like he wants to get rid of it.I thought American History X was a great movie. It tackled the hard issues of racism and hatred and showed how people can change their thoughts when they get to really know each other.",American History X
1215,dunham14,"""American History X"", Ton y Kaye out does himself with his portrayal of racism in Los Angeles CA . Told through the eyes of Derek and Daniel Vinyard",8,16 September 2012,"""American History X"", a 1998 film by Tony Kaye, starring Edward Norton as Derek Vineyard, Edward Furlong as Daniel Vineyard, and Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vineyard. The story is about two brothers growing up in Los Angeles, CA. Their father was murdered by a black drug dealer while fighting a fire in a South Central LA neighborhood. This leads to the racist tone of the movie and to Dereks hatred.The main theme in the movie is racism and the effects that it has on different groups of people. This can be seen throughout many of the scenes in the movie, one scene in particular was in the beginning when we are introduced to Derek who is seen bashing a black man's face against the curb for trying to steal from his truck. Derek is subsequently sent to prison where he finds out that being a white neo-nazi supremacist is not everything he use to think it was. Upon entering prison Derek shows off his swastika tattoo hoping to gain support and protection from other inmates that thought the way he did. This however is not the way it worked out for him. When Derek is finally released from prison he is a changed man, he no longer wants to have all the hate that he has carried with him for years and he doesn't want his little brother Daniel to follow in his footsteps. Another scene were the theme can really be seen is when Doris has a Jewish friend over for dinner, Derek cannot stand the fact that his mother has a Jewish friend and verbally abuses him and then throws him out of his house.In relation to the theme, ""Crash"" is another movie that shows a lot of the same racist tendencies. Both movies are set in Los Angeles, CA and almost draw on the natural tensions that come from that area.One technique that was used throughout the movie that I thought added a lot to the movie was the interchanging from color to black and white. Although most of the movie was in color the flashbacks that were used to depict portions of Derek's younger days were shown in black and white. I felt this did a good job of displaying the tensions and extreme hatred that Derek had at that time in his life by showing it in black and white, it gave the scene a different feel than the rest of the movie. Symbolism was also used throughout the movie. Derek showed off his swastika tattoo in prison to show his beliefs and with the hopes of finding others like him. The swastika can also be seen at the white supremacist rally. There are flags hanging in the barn and in Cameron Alexander the leader of the D.O.C.'s office along with pictures of nazi Germany. The music that is playing at the rally also adds to the theme of the movie.",American History X

It shows you the different conflicts about how people are dealing with racial issues and how this guy (Derek) didn't want his son to make the same mistakes as he did when he was younger. This movie is very surreal and helps you depict the different views of the issues going on in this movie. I think the most emotional part of this movie was the very end.

But, then again, if history has taught us one thing, it is that we can not change history. We can change our destiny. We can change the present if we set our minds to it. But we gotta act.

But the story is not what makes this a great movie.What won the movie for me was Edward Norton's character Derek Vinyard. This movie could very easily made the mistake of showing him not as a character, but as a personification of mindless rage and hate, and even though the movie sometimes go out of his way to make it clear that his beliefs and attitudes are ultimately wrong (something very justifiable given the sensitive subject), they show us where all of this come from. They us what happened to a brilliant young man that made him into a monster, giving the character depth and making us feel the tragedy of his downfall into a skinhead.The movie in a somewhat subtle way shows us that, despite the facts of his life influencing in his choice, the responsibility for his mistakes is his alone. This is made by his sister's character, who in spite of living in the same environment turned out to be a decent human being. This contrast of a character who is brutal, ruthless, and destructive to everyone around him but is not simply a diabolic Disney villain makes this a good movie.Said that, the others characters work well, with highlights to Edward Furlong who plays very well Norton's brother.Furthermore, the movie works well with the violence, making the audiences cringe with it, feel the suffering of the victims and leaving no doubt that the skinheads crosses completely any moral standart and should in no way be praised or idolized. Making the violence feel this real is somewhat difficult in an age where we are so used to it that if a movie kills less than half a planet we barely even notice.The movie is not however perfect. Norton's time in prison takes a little from the movie's plausibility, since he would need to have the shortest of sights not to realize that his open confrontation of the other neo-Nazis would lead to his raping and almost to his death, and maybe his brother reform was a little rushed.Where the story fails, the character construction and the powerful message as well as it magnificent use of visual resources redempts it. All in all, a must see. 8,5/10",American History X

This is, perhaps, one of the most difficult films there is there is to watch. Nobody gets out completely unscathed in this film. Not the white people, not the black people, not the correctional system (Norton's character kills two people and he gets out in three years), and certainly not the viewer.

1229,melchiorensing,Intriguing and impressive.,9,18 November 2004,"American History X is a movie about a boy who's brother has been in a Nazi-clan. The boy's name Daniel Vinyard and his brother is Dereck Vinyard. Daniel also becomes member of the clan. He sees his big brother as a kind of living example for his own lifestyle. Daniel had turned in a paper about ""Mein Kampf"" at school. The teacher ( who by the way is a dark-colored person ) does not accept it. He gives Daniel the order to write a paper about his brother's life. That's what the movie is about. In the movie you can see flashbacks about the life of Dereck and the actions he undertook with his clan. These actions are quite hard actions. Every not-white person was an evil person. But the strong thing about the movie is that not only Dereck and his clan are described as ""bad"" persons, also the ""dark-colored"" persons are evil. Both gangs are making rude actions and killing each other. The way the interaction between the two groups is described is very impressive. The movies characterizes in a good way too what wrong rascism can lead, from both sides. The end is also very impressive. I would say, watch the movie and your vision about rascism will change in a positive way. It is actually a non-necessary way of behaving. All people are equal and need to be threatened in that way. Greetings from Holland, Melchior Ensing",American History X
1230,bcostner21,American History X,9,4 May 2013,"In the film American History X, Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, who after some influence by his father's words, and later anger from his father's murder by a black man, becomes a neo-Nazi and joins a local Nazi gang. Derek, who heavily influences his younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong, is informed one night by Danny that two black men are breaking into his truck outside. Derek then grabs his gun, runs outside, and proceeds to gun down the men. He then finishes off one of the would-be robbers by smashing his head on the curb. Soon after, he is arrested and convicted of manslaughter, and avoiding a murder charge because his younger brother refuses to testify against him.Derek undergoes a radical transformation in prison, as he realizes that much of the racism and hatred he has been taught to display by others is really only superficial, and really deep down inside, there is no real reason for such malice. This helps show the theme of the movie, racism and hatred are learned traits, not born into a person. After enduring a violent rape in prison, and befriending a fellow black inmate, Derek has a change of heart, and realizes the foolishness of his ways, and the ignorance of hate and racism. He realizes that the most important thing in life is family, and not hatred for people unlike him. After his release from prison, Derek forsakes his old friends including his old buddy Seth, played by Ethan Suplee, and even his girlfriend Stacy, played by Fairuza Balk, as he attempts to distance himself from the neo-Nazi movement. The movie draws to a conclusion as Danny comes face to face with a boy whom he had a confrontation with days before, in the bathroom of his school on the day he is scheduled to submit his paper, American History X. The boy pulls out a pistol and shoots Danny in the chest and kills him. Derek learns of his younger brother's murder and becomes terribly distraught. The film ends with Danny's words from his paper, quoting President Abraham Lincoln. This film helps the viewer understand that hatred and racism is not something that is born in someone, as Derek and Danny were not shown to display these characteristics as children, but learned to hate as they got older by influences around them. This is a similar situation to Walt Kowalski role, played by Clint Eastwood, in the movie Gran Torino, as he witnessed the exodus of white, middle-class people from his neighborhood, and the influx of minorities. American History X uses a reoccurring motif to make the viewer aware of the racist hatred bred in the boys by those around them. We constantly see Nazi propaganda, along with swastikas, etc. Also, the dialogue in the film and the use of constant racial slurs reinforced the hatred in these young men's hearts. It is clear that racism and hatred are not traits that are born in individuals, but rather created in the hearts of impressionable people by those wishing to spread their prejudiced views to others. The theme of this movie helps us understand that a good way to keep these feelings from those we love is to try not to influence, or let them be influenced by this kind of animosity.",American History X
1231,caliorange33,Excellent Movie,10,6 May 2013,"American History X is one of the best films that I have seen in my lifetime. If I could, I would make it a mandatory viewing for every single individual. The moral lesson alone makes it a must see for everyone, especially those who are conflicted and caving to peer pressure; regardless of age. Throughout each of our lives we come to a cross roads at least once or twice where we have the opportunity to make a choice to let hatred consume us or to fight the urge for hatred to enter our hearts and our souls. This movie shows us how misdirected hatred can ruin lives, directly and indirectly. The film crew did a fantastic job collaborating to create a film that not only entertains, but one that makes the viewer think twice about the life they have lived and the impact they have had on the ones they love. I feel that all of the actors played their parts perfectly, but extra kudos goes to the core actors/characters: Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard and Edward Furlong as Danny Vinyard. These characters are played so well that you almost don't have a choice but to be pulled into the intensity of their lives. My favorite effects used in the movie, to my surprise, are the transitions from color images to black and white images. These transitions, in addition to the random and perfectly placed slow motion effects, enhance the emotional aspect of the film. As the story bounces around from present day/post incarceration and past/pre incarceration, it is easy to keep up with the storyline with the transition from color to black and white. I was surprised that I would like this aspect of the film, since I am not normally a big fan of black and white footage. The black and white images help the viewer to focus more on the emotions that need to be felt by the characters and the setting. On the surface, the film is about a reformed neo-nazi skinhead who, after being released from prison, tries to reverse the destruction he has created within his family – only to realize he is too late. Below the surface; however, is a much needed lesson that hatred of any kind will only destroy you and the people close to you. Regardless of what you believe when you allow anger to consume you, there is no good found in hatred. If you are looking for a fluffy film, this is definitely not the film for you. If you are looking to learn a much needed lesson about our culture and the world we live in, this is a must see.",American History X
1232,ksutich,I was reminded of the sheer power of this movie by watching it years later with my teenager.,9,13 June 2017,"I originally watched this movie so many years ago and was floored by it. I had forgotten how many emotions it wrangles out of you that you may not even ever suspect. It was an eye opening movie for me as a younger person and when I found out my 19 year old boy hadn't seen it, I pulled out my DVD of it and said, ""That's what we're doing tonight."" He at first had no interest in it after checking out the synopsis on the case and I almost had to force him to watch it with me. However, as I began to get immersed in this movie that I had forgotten its powers, it got quiet and I never heard another word from him. At the end of the movie, I was sniffling and I look over and he is sitting on the edge of the couch with tears, unspilled, but sitting in his eyes, mouth open, slack-jawed, and still staring at the blank screen. It was definitely a defining period in his young adulthood and a moment for me that helped define our relationship and that I'll always cherish. It's a classic that even now sometimes I talk to people who haven't seen it, and I recommend it. I'm glad I bought the DVD so long ago. It had the same reaction for me as it did the first time years ago.I don't want to let out spoilers and it's so hard with this movie. So that's why I haven't gone into detail. But if you want to see real, emotional, life changing in certain situations, movies that make you question things and/or really force you to put yourself into someone else's shoes whether you want to or not, watch this movie.",American History X

1234,tiagodz,Marxist Agenda,5,23 October 2015,"American History X intentionally mixes up concepts to cause confusion to viewers. It relates crimes motivated by racism to conservative ideas in order to cause the viewer to mistakenly associate racism to conservatism.For example, in the scene with the discussion at the dinner table, Derek delivers many TRUE facts. For example, he says that the act of someone finding an excuse to loot a store is nothing but disrespect for law and community, and not a morally fair act (supposedly legitimated by a situation of economical difficulty, or any other reason), meaning that nothing justifies robbing someone. Right after saying this, the discussion goes to a racist bias (where Derek is obviously wrong). And right after this, Derek's sister gives Marxist propaganda on how crime is caused by 'social inequalities' (and is therefore justifiable), and not a matter of moral values. That is saying it is OK to rob someone if they are richer than you. Derek than argues (correctly) that this opinion of hers is just like taking one thing (robbery, for example) and calling it something else (redistribution, for example, or, to quote Derek, it's like saying ""It's not crime, it's poverty""), with the intent to alleviate the responsibility of the one who commits it. That's exactly what Marxism does.This twisting of concepts happen in other passages of the film, where the speeches and dialogues intertwine racist and conservative ideas. For example, in the scene where Derek fairly criticizes welfare (which is basically looting tax-payers to give privileges to others) and right away he says something racist.The director's intent is clear: to unfairly associate racism to conservatism using a Nazi character to place conservative and racist ideas side by side, thus leading the naive viewer to wrongly believe these ideas are one and the same.",American History X
1235,cadainoff,Just Horrible,1,21 January 2005,"Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It reeks from start to finish, which is all the more painful because it was supposed to be good. Edward Norton sounds and looks more like the president of the Yale Republican Club than a white supremacist skinhead - the movies truly fatal flaw considering he's the linchpin of the whole thing. Elliot Gould as a woolly, ineffectual liberal is a stereotype, one of many in the cast.More troubling than the acting, though, is the direction, which could charitably be called confused. How else to explain why we end up rooting for the skinheads to beat the black guys in a basketball game to determine who will stay off the public courts of Venice for good. How else to explain that the skinheads actually win? On the Venice courts, where the level of play is so high that Ron Shelton actually set his own movie there (""White Men Can't Jump"")? This scene is symbolic of how completely out of touch this movie is, how it ignores basic realities to construct its own while purporting to tell the truth, and how confused its storytelling and direction are. If racism is so bad, why are the majority of the black characters so unlikable, and why do the white supremacist characters seem so much more sympathetic and their actions so much more understandable? These concerns would be mere quibbles if the movie didn't claim to be so much more than it actually is. It fails to convey its message, and it fails artistically. Everything about it just sucks.",American History X

The story is amezing.Men are commonly raped in prison—especially if they do what Derek did. And, in a movie about white supremacy,Nazism and gangs the violence is to be expected. What I like about this movie is that it shows something prevelent in our world today—hate. It must be remembered that we as Christians are in class despised by these very groups.

The title of it had put up a ''Indian vs White Men'' kind of a thing in my mind. But it was much more different. I just hope that the simple minded humans won't see the reason of Edward Norton's character's change in the movie as rape. That laundry has changed him. Between all those white sheets there was a black sheet, and the blinding light of the white sheets has caused him to see peace in the black sheet. In the movie, it is perfectly represented that human mind is something else than just a follower of a path. My brother has a saying: ''Never hate the change, for the change is the very reason men was created.'' A man who can change is greater than the others.And man, what an ending! I never knew that i was such an emotional person. When i looked at the mirror after the credits, i had no difference than a tomato.Such a powerful movie. This movie has taught me hatred.

1240,FeistyCadavr,Thoughts on American History X,10,11 December 2007,"The movie was written by McKenna (presumably Gentile), and put out by New Line (Jewish owned). It would have been interesting to be a fly on the wall at the production meetings as they tried to balance the need to make an interesting movie (letting a Nazi make his case) against the need for Semitical Correctness.... I truly wonder where the writer's opinions lie. The indications are that he has a good deal more sympathy for the skins' case than the Jews' because the former is strongly drawn, while the latter is barely sketched.The guts of the movie are the speeches by Derek. Of these speeches, the best is his dinner-table destruction of the Jewish cant put out by the Elliot Gould character courting his mother in which he demolishes the Jew's inevitable excuse explanations of poverty and racism for Rodney King and the L.A. riots. Edward Norton is a fine actor, and is quite persuasive as a strong and principled skinhead. He is much less plausible as a post-prison reformed soul, but that is a script problem. We are supposed to believe that the principles he stated and defended at the risk of his life have been changed because he encountered a funny Black man and some corrupt White racists in prison. This failure of characterization was probably made necessary by the dictates of Semitical Correctness at New Line. I'm sure McKenna realizes that Derek would be nothing but entrenched in his beliefs by a stint in prison.In fact, at no point are the racist beliefs of the main characters Derek and younger brother Daniel challenged. By challenged, I mean shown to be logically or evidentially impaired. Instead, they are attacked modern-style, by fem-think. We see kicked-to-the-curb Gould saying ""I'm sorry"" to Derek's mother, his tragic gaze suggesting his horror at a son so far gone. Perhaps the Jews at New Line think fifty years of maceration in their agitprop have the rest of us accepting their ""perfect and persecuted"" self-portrait. Perhaps they really do think that raised eyebrows, shaken heads and baleful stares and speech codes and prison sentences are strictest refutation. Hell, simple coherence -- let alone logic -- seems too much to ask of Hollywood these days.Gould was perfect casting. At once patronizing and effeminate, he is the precise foil to Norton's master-of-my-own-house masculinity. It's not just that a poorly educated skin makes mincemeat of him in argument, but that his Jewish dogma is so ugly. In Norton's combative integrity we see the Old America, made up of free and responsible White men. In Gould we see the coming World Slave State, where the thinking is done for us, and it remains only to Accept.The part that bodes thinking on is that this movie is about an inch from being quaint. As in, Oh, how cute, that little white mouse is crouching in the corner, baring its teeth in self-defense!, as our ugly Jewish hand reaches in to pick it up to feed it to the snake. Isn't that precious. Such stirring words and sculpted pecs! What a man he might have been two hundred years ago! But thanks to TV, we are all Jews now....",American History X

1242,zayronick,Best of the ninety's liberal or not!,10,23 November 2009,"American History X is about brothers Derek (played by Edward Norton) and Daniel Vinyard (played by Edward Furlong) whose father was a fireman responding to a fire. When reviving to the scene he gets shot by gang members.This leads to hatred against (mostly immigrants)foreigners from Derek and, being the eldest of the sons, he makes Daniel and the rest of his family grow up in a white supremacy surrounding. This will be shown in the movie many times, for example by hatred against a Jewish teacher who is trying to date his mother. Even though Daniel seems to be OK with the white supremacy surroundings, it's shown that he is more into having friends than being an outcast from his social surroundings. One day black gang members loose a basketball game against Derek's white gang. The looser would not show themselves ever again on the basketball court. This leads to retaliation and some of the black gang members are trying to steal the boy's deceased father's truck in the middle of the night. Daniel sees it and tells to Derek about it. Derek grabs his gun and kills two gang members in a brutal way. Derek is sentenced to prison for three years. Derek has a hard time fitting in to any group in prison and slowly becomes friend of another inmate who is black. This and many other factors make Derek finding him self in an ideological crisis. When he returns from prison reformed, his younger brother Daniel Vinyard who idolizes him is on the brink of becoming a Neo Nazi himself.Edward Norton and Edward Furlong do a breathtaking performance and you can really feel their repressed feelings and brotherly love for each other. Edward Norton transforms from a hateful Neo-Nazi to an intelligent normal man and does it in a realistic way. Edward Norton shows really good how he is trying to live up to Derek and feeling ashamed about it at the same time.Other actors like Beverly D'Angelo playing their mother are really good, too. She is being in a living hell after his husband's death and seeing her sons becoming racist. There are lots of smaller parts like Ethan Suplee's role as Seth Ryan, a dumb Derek idolizing, over weight racist, which makes the story just stronger. The movie is really violent in some parts but it is almost a must to keep the feeling so strong.Tony Kaye does an amazing job directing and timing every shot so that you don't get confused on flashbacks and what is happening at the moment. The movie reminds the viewer that we live in a world of chain reactions that can be transformed into hate and love. The film itself is a sincere and yet unrelentingly harsh look at race hatred in our modern society.The colour of the people is just what we see but as a human being we are all the same. Colour of the people is just what we see but as a human being we are all the same.Still, there are some problems. For example Dr. Sweeny (a black teacher) assigns Danny, the younger brother, to write an essay on his family history and his older brother's impact on his life. The paper is a part of what Sweeny calls ""American History X."" The film leads us to believe, then, that the movie a story about Danny. But it isn't. It's Derek's story. I think that it was an unnecessary for Daniel to begin the story or it could have been done better.Even though the movie is probably one of the best movies of the ninety's and leaves no one cold.",American History X
1243,camille-mennesson,Brace Yourself,8,27 May 2014,"I have watched American History X three times now, and the reaction and feeling I get after watching it is always the same: stunned. Tony Kaye, who directed the movie, plunged us into the troubled and dangerous life of Venice Beach, California, torn apart by the different gangs fighting for their space. Edward Norton and Edward Furlong star in the film, and leave us both tongue-tied at the end of this amazing drama.The movie tells the story of two brothers involved in a Neo-Nazi movement, after the death of their father killed by a black drug dealer. The older brother, DerekVinyard (Edward Norton), is sentenced to 3 years of prison for manslaughter, and comes back from it with his beliefs entirely changed. The people he met and the things he saw and endured during this time made him realize the true and important things in life. He will then try to open his brother's (Edward Furlon) eyes to stop him from becoming what he used to be.One of the big paradoxes of this movie is the character of Derek. As much as we may have hated him at the beginning from all his racist thoughts, acts and violence against stranger but even his family, we cannot help but forgive his mistakes when he comes around at the end and try to make up for what he has done. Indeed, the intelligence of the character serving an awful purpose at the beginning comes eventually to his rescue and to the rescue of his family. This evolution is the greatest thing to witness and gives us an inexplicable joy. This is such a success thanks to the talent of Edward Norton, able to embody and incarnate really both sides of this character so well.Tony Kaye decided to build the movie based on flashback from the time the father was still alive, to make us understand how racism developed, rooted and almost destroyed this family. All the scenes from the past are in black and white, as if the director wanted to give us a hint on the end of the movie,saying ""this time is over, things have changed now"".Overall, the movie is captivating and surprising mostly because it does not have the same approach as most racism criticizing movies. It is not a judgmental view of racism here, even though it is still described as horrendous and unacceptable. Indeed, the director chose to show us more how can racism be accepted and defended in the context in which the family is living and how one's judgment can be obscured by the common vision you have to share when part of a group or gang like they are.Final word, this film is to be seen absolutely, but brace yourself, you are going to be startled and even shocked sometimes; it is part of the charm of American History X.",American History X

I am full aware that this movie is shown in high schools all over the world with the message of Tony Kaye still living on. This movie needs to be seen by everyone who may and if you show it to someone who has never seen it, it will surely not disappoint. It makes you contemplate the power of ignorance, the power of brotherhood, and the immense power of love towards a family. What is also interesting about the movie is that it is bringing up something that is still relevant today. White extremists are thought of as a minor group in any community but that doesn't change the fact that they still exist. In Sweden for example, fascists and white power-based parties are growing like never before since ww2 and so is political violence.

The performance alone from Edward Norton was phenomenal, the guy takes you on an emotional roller-coaster like you would not believe until you have seen it for yourself. There are good actors who will portray a character well enough for the audience to understand a role but to make the viewers really get the uncensored underlying emotions and thoughts of the character is a talent to be well respected.

Understanding a neo-nazism skinheads lifestyle is not an easy task and this film certainly doesn't make it any easier but it is worth a watch if you can stomach the hard hitting punches of racism and violence.",American History X

The film shows several stages that could through ways of seeing things from the so-called skin-head without become this absolute truth. Hatred, violence, loneliness, redemption, are some of the emotions that are portrayed in this story. All carried out with great performances as those of Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, plus excellent picture with several ""flashback"" in black and white combined with moments ""current"" color.

His excellent portrayal of Derek, a brutal Nazi loving thug who through his life changing experiences in prison slowly realises the error of his ways. Supported by a fine performance by Edward Furlong who plays his idolising, yet astute younger brother Danny the film rolls a emotional ride of hate for black, Jewish, Asian, if fact anyone who does not fit with Derek's view of a normal American to the love for his brother and other members of his family. Extremely violent scenes in the film are not only justified to establish the utter ruthlessness of Derek but probably a true reflection of how these people live and think.",American History X

This film sheds light on issues that many people in society are afraid to discuss or take seriously. It does a fine job dealing with racism. A beautifully composed film. Edward Norton is as usual, a great performer, makes you LIVE every moment. I can't do any justice by putting my review about this movie, but I would say:""A must watch classic"".Unexpected turn of events more than once & Edward Norton makes it even better as he shows his true talent from the beginning. Mixed feelings and a variety of thoughts are brought up by the performances. You need to see it yourself, it will be worth your every second.

Derek gets his gun, kills them and then he is sent to prison. The movie follows his life in prison as well as his one before he becomes a Neo Nazi. We learn for example that Derek has been shaped by his father in racism. Meanwhile, Danny, seems to follow his brother's footsteps. After he writes review in favor of Mein Kampf, his principal forces him to write about Derek.
Apart from the out of the world performance of the actor Edward Norton, this is a movie well - worth seeing because it explains how racism is rising and why.

1255,goff08,spoiler alert. American can learn from this movie.,9,27 October 2014,"A former skin head in L.A recently released from prison and now reformed, attempts to change his ways and correct his past battles, to better his brother that is following down the same dark path he had been down.The theme of American History X is struggle to change. Derek from the opening scene is almost looked at as a Christ like figure when the cops arrive they ask him to drop the weapon and turn around. The camera angle is upward and it goes slow motion. This scene makes him appear like a superhuman or God like figure especially when he puts his arms out like he is on a cross. Derek's tattoos are very noticeable in this scene you see the D.O.C tattoo which normally means department of corrections. But if you really think of it as a struggle to change to help his brother Danny than you might say it could stand for die on cross like God did.After the opening scene the story is told from Danny's point of view. Their father was a fire fighter that had been shot while on duty trying to put out a fire at a possible drug house. Their father seemed to plant a racist seed in Derek and Danny's brain at breakfast one morning when Derek had brought up about his teacher having them read a book about affirmative action. From their on he flashed back to the coming of power of his brother in the DOC. Everyone in the DOC seemed to look up to his brother as a leader. On the basketball courts the DOC play an all-black basketball team for the rights to stay on the courts. Derek ends up slam dunking a basketball to win the game he then hangs on the rim. This is shot in slow motion once again peering up at him hanging showing him as a power figure once again. While in prison Derek starts to become friends with a black man Lamont. They become friends while working in the laundry room at the prison. While Derek is locked up Danny starts to get into the DOC heavily and following after Cameron. Dr. Bob Sweeney was a teacher of Derek's in high school, and is now Danny's teacher. He ends up helping to get Derek out of prison early after he had been raped by other White Supremacist for becoming friends with black people in prison. Dr. Bob Sweeney wants Derek to help get Danny back on the straight and narrow. Once out Derek breaks ties with the DOC and starts to get Danny turned around. Everything seems to be looking up for Danny, Derek and their mother until the closing scene of the movie Danny has had a run in with a black student from his school in which this time the other student is finally going to get the last word. American History X in my opinion is very similar to Menace to Society in the way that the characters end up being fairly innocent in the start of the movie turn for the worst and start to make a turnaround for the better again and in both movies end up dying.Like I have pointed out I think the slow motion scenes along with the angle are two techniques to help show the theme of this movie. Everyone seems to look up to Derek and the slow motion throughout the different scenes adds to his power and authoritativeness of his character in this movie, by looking at him at an upward appearance along with panning over/ at him and his muscular physique in slow motion to make sure he is given attention.""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."" -Nelson Mandela",American History X

It's one such movie wherein you'll find yourself somewhere among those characters and compare yourself with one of those, I mean if you are really a movie nerd. Being an Indian I really don't picturize what sort of discrimination is going on in USA. But this movie I think really gave me an idea of what it is like. And I got to know it's all about exasperation.Edward Norton did the best, was definitely an academy award performance by him.As you keep watching the movie at particular time you'll have a different perception about it. It'll definitely change your paradigm and you'll start thinking alongside Edward, which is the best part of the movie.

Edward Nortons spell bounding performance receives so much praise and admiration that I think Ed Furlongs performance is overshadowed. This is a complete shame as Furlong as absolutely spectacular in the role of Danny and portrays the ""young, angry white boy"" superbly. The film has no rest bite whatsoever and continuously amazes throughout. With most films there is a peak that you reach mid way through and then you can look away and breathe, but American History X permanently shocks and steals your breath. It is truly brilliant and Tony Kaye has definitely never directed a film as good as this, and he is extremely unlikely to. If you haven't seen it shame on you. If you have and you aren't in love with it shame on you too. WAY WAY WAY BETTER than the Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Lord Of The Rings and anything else you can show me.",American History X

And in prison he starts to see the flaws in what he believes in So when he got out of prison, he tries to rescue his younger brother Danny from falling in the same mistakes he did. And the story goes by. Personally, I admired the movie very much and I guess it is one of the best movies of all times. Our story-line here is the present and we move forward to see in the process flashbacks to previous events in the past and here was a thoughtful great touch to represent these events in black and white. Our Actors here were the best with flawless and unforgettable performance. The plot however is the one element you can doubt as I thought that it wasn't enough to build the twist on it and it needed a little convincing time and reason but I guess the movie here wasn't trying to lecturer those who are in the same path that Derek took So in a complete evaluation I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I encourage you to watch it.",American History X
1263,youarenothing,A touch over-dramatic but otherwise a perfect film,8,22 June 2005,"Yes, I agree, the slow-motion portions are there to make the scenes more dramatic than they need to be. Yes, the black and white for the flashbacks was unnecessary, but overall, this film has done for racism what Homeroom and Elephant did for school shootings.There is no explanation why Derek becomes a neo-nazi, yes his father was probably a part of it, as well as just being young and influenced by Cameron. It could also be attributed to his surroundings, the way he grew up, but there is no clear answer and that is what makes it so powerful. The fact that you don't have to be poor, you don't have to grow up in terrible surroundings, or have your parents influence you, to hate people that much.Edward Norton's performance was brilliant, his tone and body language was spot-on, although whenever he cried I was reminded that it was an actor playing a part and not Derek Vineyard. Edward Furlong may have been miscast but he still pulled Danny off very well, the voice-overs being perfectly apathetic.The cinematography was beautiful, the arrest scene when there was an American flag in the background behind Danny while the policeman was covering Derek's swastika, and the end scene was an amazing reminder of Lester in American Beauty. Red on white will always be the most powerful colors in my mind.Overall, I loved this film, not because it was ""edgy"" but because it, overall was better than 99% of the films I have seen and it left me shaking and in tears at the end, that is what I call a powerful film.",American History X

Derek is a neo-Nazi growing up in Venice Beach, CA. The film is very moving and a realistic account of race relations in Southern California, and also of the inner workings of prison life. The ending of the film was a bit sad, and was probably the weakest part of the film, in my opinion. The film moves along superbly, however, after Derek is released from Prison, he is a changed person, and in my opinion, I'm not so sure he would have done a complete 180 like that, however, it makes sense for the films sake. All in all, this is very watchable. Certainly a rated R movie, very graphic and strong language.",American History X

Is this something they inserted into the script intentionally, as a test case? to test if the audience really understands their message, or if they're just saying the mantra of the day?

1266,marshoby,awe,10,4 June 2015,"""American History X"" is a poignant story of family, redemption and retribution. It revolves around the life of Derek Vinyard, a Neo- Nazi who, after doing three years of prison and self-reflection, changes his ways, and when he is released from prison, tries to do the same for his younger brother; Danny Vinyard. Edward Norton does a fantastic job of portraying Derek, both before and after his transformation from his skinhead lifestyle. Norton accurately displays the opinions and thoughts of his character, without making him come across as your typical neo-nazi; Derek is an angry and frustrated man who blames blacks for his father's murder - yet he is intelligent and has his own opinions and thoughts regarding modern society; he is not narrow-minded, despite his strongly racist mindset. After his trasformation, Norton still plays Derek in a practically flaw- less manner, portraying him as the older brother filled with regret and remorse, but also someone who has not let this get the better of him. He portrays him as someone who now has responsibilities in his life, and also someone who is determined to turn both his and Danny's life ar- ound.Edward Norton is not the only actor in this film who does an outstanding job of portraying their character. Edward Furlong plays Danny, Derek's younger, confused brother. Furlong plays this character almost immaculately; he accurately portrays the frustration and rebellious nature that resides in this character. Danny was, for me, the most interesting character in the film; although I have no doubt others will disagree entirely. However, Danny is a high school student who has spent his whole life looking up to his brother Derek, idolizing him throughout his childhood and young adulthood, meaning that Dereks actions have reflected heavily onto his younger brother. In one scene, Derek has a dispute with his family about Derek's views. Danny rarely speaks in this act, but when he does, he is defending his brohter. The film is visually powerful. When the film is going through a flashback, the screen is changed to black and white, which helps to add to the overall dark tone of the film. One of the most notable aspects of the film are the prison scenes; During his jail time, Derek's only real friends turn out to be those who he thought he hated the most; the blacks. Derek befriends a black man named Lamont (played by Guy Torry) , who is essentially the biggest reason for Derek's transformation; He teaches Derek that, basically, not all black people are bad. When they first meet, Lamont knows that Derek is a skinhead; he knows that Derek most probably resents him just because of his skin colour. Despite this, Lamont still shows respect for Derek, showing him the ropes and being his only real friend in the prison. Derek's other black associate is a man named Sweeney, who is Danny's high school teacher. During the course of the film, Sweeney and Derek become closer friends, mainly through Danny. But here is the most important part: when Derek is assaulted in jail, Sweeney is literally the only one who is there for him. Lamont and Sweeney are possibly the two most important characters in the entire story; they prove to Derek that even whites can be bad, and that even blacks can be good. Without these two characters, when Derek left jail he probably would've just gone straight back to his old ways.In conclusion, ""American History X"" is a film that is not afraid to deal with common issues in American society head on. The film does not hold back, and hits the audience with cold, hard truth combined with it's gritty realism that leaves viewers in magnificent awe. AHX has one message, and it delivers it beautfully; and it is that if you follow the path of hatred, sooner or later you will pay the price.",American History X

Probably my favourite movie with Edward Norton in it of all time and I would like to see him play some similar roles like this again because he is so good at it! Very capable of playing many different roles but this is definitely some of his best work apart from fight club! watch this movie now, and if you already have, watch it again, classic!

1268,mario_ahmed,My Best Movie,10,30 July 2016,"This Movie gonna make me happy every time i watch it. The scariest and most convincing scenes are the ones in which we see the skinheads bonding. They're led by Derek's brilliant speech-making and filled by drugs, beer, tattoos, heavy metal and the need all insecure people feel to belong to a movement greater than themselves. It is assumed in their world (the beaches and playgrounds of the Venice area of L.A.) that all races stick together and are at undeclared war with all others. What we get, finally, is a series of well-drawn sketches and powerful scenes, in search of an organizing principle. The movie needs sweep where it only has plot. And Norton, effective as he is, comes across more as a bright kid with bad ideas than as a racist burning with hate. (I am reminded of Tim Roth's truly satanic skinhead in ""Made in Britain,"" a 1982 film by Alan Clarke.) Kaye wanted to have his name removed as the film's director, arguing that the film needed more work and that Norton re-edited some sequences. We will probably never know the truth behind the controversy. My guess is that the post-production repairs were inspired by a screenplay that attempted to cover too much ground in too little time and yet hastens to a conventional conclusion.Still, I must be clear: This is a good and powerful film.

1273,maxletsch,Does anyone think this movie has aged well?,3,25 December 2019,"I had heard nothing but good things about this movie, but after watching it last night I can definitely say I was severely disappointed. The director (Tony Kaye) distanced himself from the final cut, so I'm not sure how much of the blame I can put on him versus Norton and New Line Cinema.The acting was stiff (I believe Norton miraculously won an award for his dry eyed performance), the dialogue was clunky, the cinematography resembles the work of an amateur film student, and the characters are written horribly.Kaye has made other movies which seem to be notorious for staying in the middle of issues and presenting both sides equally. This movie seems to lean heavily towards the Neo-Nazis by explaining their motives in depth and presenting most of the black characters as heartless stereotypical gangsters. The few exceptions to this are two characters who seemingly only exist to better the racists as if it's their job.Overall, I'm giving it a 3 because it somewhat tries to send a good message while still being confusingly sympathetic towards one side of a double edged sword (at best)",American History X
1274,akkocyalcin,perfect,9,1 January 2016,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success.

But the fact that truth told in the beginning about the gangs and ruination of the neighborhood was glossed over was wrong. The truth should have been presented in a more detailed account of the destruction of the major cities of the United States. But as previously stated, the acting was good and although the premise was ridiculous the film is worth watching.",American History X
1277,charles_ddp,You can't get bored,8,29 February 2016,"Recently, I saw American History X again, because I had some work to do about it and because I was very pleased with it the first time I saw it. The truth is, you can't get bored by watching it.Without intention to challenge the fact that it is a great movie, something that can disappoint people is that some scenes are probably far too romantic and easily predictable. Theoretically, the movie claims to point the finger at racism ; it attempts to show us the conversion of the protagonist to the path of righteousness. Of course it is a noble goal, but some parts of the story look naive or even childish (Derek's conversion seems absolutely not rational for example), despite the fact that others are actually maybe not enough romantic because they tend to show us a reality which looks far away from us : hardcore violence and racism.In this review I would like to examine the inner morality of the movie. American History X has often been accused of a ""morally dangerous cinematic seduction"". What the critics mean is that the film would manipulate the viewer through ""glamorizing an immoral and hate- filled neo-nazi protagonist"", instead of denouncing racism. All this by using cinematic effects and techniques. However, I don't think that this argument is relevant. The film, as a matter of fact, takes place in an historical context and shows Derek's life and what happens to him. Of course you will understand why he's angry, how he became who he is. Nonetheless, it doesn't mean that it justifies his ideology : it is the way that the film uses to introduce us the white supremacy groups world and the conflicts of those times. The techniques employed may allow for many viewers a degree of sympathy towards Derek, but that is actually for me an interesting point of the movie. What I mean is that we can see the story within that contested groups and this is the master card of American History X.",American History X

1280,sweetdude168,Terrific Movie. (Brief Review),10,3 April 2007,"This movie is about a Neo-Nazi named Derek Vinyard, who finds his way to jail after murdering two African American LA Crips. His influenced hate on all non-white races began when his father was murdered by an African American while putting out a fire in the ghetto. His father taught him the ways of how African American's are always favoured in America because of what they had to go through in the past. When Derek is sent to jail, he quickly found other Neo-Nazi's to friend with. Still not changed, Derek finds that his own people are ripping off each other with Drug Dealing; after finding this out he becomes furious and starts playing basketball with the Black's and Hispanic's. Derek's Neo-Nazi co-friends get upset, and rape him in jail. When Derek comes out of jail he's a changed man. He tries to get his brother to not walk in his footsteps.",American History X
1281,josephdenuzzio,"Great film, regardless of any bias one may have.",9,1 July 2016,"While not perfect of course, this movie does do a wonderful job of exposing what racism and hate can do to a person or what effects they have on families. The main character, Danny, finds himself following the same White Supremacist cult that his older brother Derek had followed, which ultimately led to his arrest early in the film. Throughout the rest of the film, both Derek and Danny go through the same character arc - from racism to tolerance. There are many flashback, as well as present scenes in the movie that are very difficult to watch, but this is how director Tony Kaye constructs the picture of racism in households in America and the effects it has. The only complaint I have about this movie is the ending, I believe it is too ambiguous for the movie; but then again, it may be best that way.",American History X
1282,grimlovelis,Perfectly Gritty,9,16 July 2016,"It is rare that a film carries such weight and violence without feeling bloated, yet the grittiness of the film lends itself to heavy subject matter. I can still hear those teeth chattering against the concrete when I think of monotone intro that sets the tone. This movie could have been made today and it would have been great, but the 90s quality and feel inherent in the picture sets it apart. There are so many moments through the story that could be seen as shock value, but it always seems right. It's a perfectly gritty film about a very dark undercurrent that runs through America and likely always will to some extent. It's raw, honest, and ultimately heartbreaking as humans are terribly, terribly flawed, and that makes for compelling story lines.",American History X
1283,ameyaloya,American History X,9,15 August 2016,"American History X American History X is a magnificent movie and I would definitely rate it as one of the greatest movies dealing with the extremely sensitive topic of racism. Directed by debutant Tony Kaye, it examines and digs deep into the roots of prejudice.It is the story of a teenager Derek Vinyard, played by Edward Norton, who descents into Neo-Nazism after the death of his father. He is sent into the jail for killing two black people. In there, he has some life changing experiences which force him to retrospect the choices that he made. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Danny Vinyard is looking to follow his footsteps by joining the gang of neo-Nazists skinheads.Norton plays the role so persuasively and convincingly that it is easy to see how people get caught up in all this hatred.He was also runner up for the Oscars in the Best actor category for the same. Edward Furlong, who plays the role of Danny Vinyard along with the rest of the cast do their job pretty decently.All in all, the movie is filled with violence, racist spouting and tons of profanity and yet is an extremely compelling movie right from the beginning to the end. It is an unrelenting movie and seldom makes an easy choice. Finally, this movie gives a very simple take home message - "" Hate is a baggage. Life is too short to be angry off all the time. It's just not worth it. """,American History X
1284,carlsvenssons,Triggering racism,2,10 September 2016,"American History X may be one of the most racist films ever made. A summary of the message of the film could look as follows: If you are a nice white all-American family, don't ever sit around the kitchen table and talk negatively about blacks or immigrants or criticize main-stream media, however subtly, because that will most certainly turn your son into a violent hateful Nazi which will make him commit heinous crimes which will make him spend many many years in jail, where he will get raped by big black men as further rightful punishment for his sins. After that treatment he will learn not to be an evil white racist Nazi anymore, but his massive past racial sins will continue to hunt him anyway and in the end his beloved brother will have to die because of the older brother's hate and evil white Nazi racism.Only a clearly paranoid director with racial hang-ups could have come up with this script.",American History X
1285,Deus_Leviathan,Extremity,10,8 November 2005,"This movie is directly related to Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X,"" where both characters experience the metamorphoses of: 1) Self-hate 2) Extreme hate of viewed opponents and oppressors 3) A balance and realizationI've learned a lot from these two movies. They speak directly of the balance that exists everywhere, which is inevitable and everlasting. Balance always exists, but the process by which it is achieved can be drastic and violent sometimes. (Derek kills two black men; later, his brother is killed by a black teenager.) So, extremity can sometimes be the only way to go about solving things, but it ultimately needs to balanced out with logic. White supremacy in slavery leads to black supremacy in the civil rights movement, which leads to white supremacy immediately after. I used to think it was weak to be balanced in my viewpoints of the world. While it is okay to be angry and believe things are unfair, finding balance is the ultimate outcome. Well, either you find balance for yourself, or balance finds you, and sometimes it isn't the most pleasurable lesson.After birth comes death, and from death comes birth.",American History X

Did anyone else get this clear expression of the unfair justice system? This movie is Derek killing 2 black people and serving only 3 years for the crime. He did change after his jail time, after he realised that blacks were just like him, human, feeling but it didn't cut it for me. There is a karma in Derek's little brother getting killed because he killed someone's brother, someone's son, possibly someone's father. The message is change your hating ways before it's too late.

1289,fannydellenbo,Unforgettable film!,9,6 February 2020,"Where should I begin? This movie is beyond borders. First of all is the portraying of two brothers and their path in finding identity. The oldest brother, Derek, finds home in the local nazi-gang and Danny is soon to follow. This is implied in a very nice way and as a viewer you never really question why.The second treasure in this movie is everything we learn about group-identity. After watching, you will understand so much better why people join the nazis. The whole movie is very thought-out by the writers and in my psychology-course we have analysed it in many ways. We have for example talked about why the mother doesn't argue against the boys behavior and how the nazi-group works as a ""home"".And then there is all the rest camerawork, acting...down to costume it's all absolutely great. The only reason why I don't give it a ten is that I sometimes think it's a little bit too violent.

Ed Norton excels in playing dynamic characters, and this performance is in-line with his acting in Fight Club and The People vs. Larry Flint -- his performance is an honest and believable portrayal of self-recognition and redemptionThe camera work and direction are well-designed and artistic. If there's one thing this movie lacks, however, the writing is not on the same par as the rest of the movie -- the overall screenplay makes a classic, but the individual lines fall flat and some of the mechanics used for exposition fall pretty flat.",American History X

Have your college professors use it in a film class. GREAT!!The dinner scene is one to be remembered with your own dinner scenes. The fact that a black man defended him in prison was well used to point out that the Nazi's hated others not like them.

The camera angles are original. I recommend it to everyone, young and old. The director portrays the issue of neo-nazi's and rasism from the white supremist's point of view. By the end of the movie you are sympathizing with Derick and his brother Danny, despite what they have done to blacks and other minorities. It shows how rasism starts and how usually starts at home. Parents have a huge influence on how their kids view the world, and the director acknowleges this.

Having seen this movie the viewer will see bigotry portrayed as naked discrimination and the deceitful mask of warmongers mimicking great peaceful demonstrators hiding the excuses for war in other leaders successes. This warns that seeking the same fame without the same determination and honor makes for the revelation of false motives. This movie is a landmark in the industry. A must see for those who believe that they have to hate someone. Neo-Nazi skin-heads are seen by the parents of the neighborhoods and find themselves reacting to the anger of a suppressed nation of black youths. They seek solace in the act of forming their own gangs, believing that there is safety in numbers.

1299,js75231,American History X,10,14 November 2005,"Americam History X,is a very good movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters, and I was directly changed on some of my point of views, that I had before the movie. Edward Norton, which gained about 30 pounds of muscle for this movie was astonishingly, with his roll and how he played it. Edward Furlong also played a good role. Here is a review of the movie. The story follows an intelligent young man named Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and his decline into the world of disillusion and hate known as White Supremacy. Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) buffed up to 190 pounds, with a shaved head, swastika tattoo, biker goatee and a feral, angry gaze, he is one scary image. Once a thoughtful and easy-going teen, he soon begins his change when his casually racist firefighter father is killed while trying to put out a fire in a black neighborhood. Falling under the wind of a neo-Nazi (Stacy Keach), Derek becomes a recruiting agent for local white kids. While the local movement grows, Derek gets deeper and deeper in, polluted more and more by hate. This all comes together when Derek kills two black gang members who tried to steal his truck. He is caught and sent to jail, where he is shown the error of his ways. The hard way. With the help of one of his former teachers (Avery Brooks), Derek begins to reform. However, it may be too little too late. While Derek was in prison, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is starting to head down the same path. Now, aside from trying to leave the world he created he has to save his little brother from it too. I had do to a movie review for my English class so I watched the movie again, and I was not nearly as pleased as the first time. The movie seemed kind of all fake and so played out. You knew what was going to happen next. So I guess if I was you I would only see it once, and I would definitely not buy the DVD unless you collect movies, because this would be a very good movie to add to your collection.",American History X

1306,greenhalgho,"A Powerful, Eye Opening Story About Change",10,16 March 2018,"When I first came across the movie American History X it was while I was looking through Edward Nortons films on his profile. Having seen Primal Fear and Fight Club just a few weeks prior to this I was intrigued to see what other roles he could take on. Furthermore, I was a huge fan of Edward Furlong in Terminator 2 and was happily surprised to see him on this cast list as between 1991 and 1998 when this was released, he did not have many major roles.The story is told through switching from present to past and the way it is done is simply outstanding. The flashback scenes are in black and white to firstly make it clear when the time period is and arguably also to show the darkness that was consuming Edward Nortons character when following the neo-nazi way of life that he did for so long. Edward Norton himself also adds to this effect and his performance makes it seem like he is playing two separate characters. His brother in the movie 'Danny' is played by Edward Furlong who gives a very gripping performance as we see his character change his ways completely in front of our eyes. The time period of only one day also adds the severity of this change and in a very powerful way shows the effect of influence that one person can have on another.For people that haven't seen this movie it is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies I have personally seen and one that I believe everyone should watch. Because of this, I have not given away many details of the movie and I believe that words cannot convey the true message that this 'masterpiece' conveys.10/10.

While imprisoned his beliefs are transformed for a more positive outlook. He returns home only to find his little brother following in his footsteps. The main character, Derek, portrayed by Edward Norton was your typical white Supremist; full of hatred and stupidity. This is the type of movie that you love to hate. It was very well-acted I personally believed that the Academy Award belonged to Edward Norton for best actor. I hate however, that his little brother, Danny(played by Edward Furlong), was murdered by a black man. Just when it seemed like Derek had came around, he could have very easily been pushed back into the hatred he had once embraced, by the premature death of his brother. Easily put: what goes around comes around, and it sucks. The musical score to this film was awesome, the instrumental score really brought depth and meaning to certain turning points in the film.

Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present.
