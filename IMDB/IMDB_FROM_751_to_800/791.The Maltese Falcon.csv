0,MartinHafer,It's very good but Bogart did several better films AND it was nearly a duplicate of the 1931 version,8,13 April 2007,"I liked THE MALTESE FALCON and think it's a very good example of Warner Brothers Film Noir. However, for me, I can't see why this is among the very highest rated Bogart films on IMDb. Of course CASABLANCA is rated highest (this is no surprise), but I actually preferred a few of Bogart's less famous films over THE MALTESE FALCON (such as THE CAINE MUTINY). Instead of discussing all that has already been stated in many other reviews, I'll explain the one failing I noticed in this otherwise exceptional film. Despite the film being Noir, it had a surprisingly small amount of action and towards the end, it is way too talky as they explained the plot--sort of like they were filling in the missing pieces--most of which seemed like guesswork on Sam Spade's part. I really think the script could have been tightened up in this regard. Still, with exceptional supporting actors, a great cynical performance by Bogie AND the best last ten minutes you'll find in almost any film, it still is an exceptional film--well worth seeing.Also, I recently saw the 1931 MALTESE FALCON starring Ricardo Cortez. While Cortez was not as exciting in the lead as Bogart, the film was in many places word-for-word the same film. Dudley Diggs' version of the Fat Man was also essentially copied by Sidney Greenstreet a decade later.By the way, I have never seen an explanation for this, but I noticed one odd thing about the film. When Sidney Greenstreet is slashing at the statue and yelling, the voice does not appear to be his but was dubbed by another actor. I've seen the film several times and last time I even reviewed this scene and it just doesn't sound like him (actually, it sounds a little like Claude Rains). I assume it was inserted sloppily later but am surprised others didn't point this out as well. If you can help explain this, drop me a line.",The Maltese Falcon
1,TheLittleSongbird,Superb cinematic entertainment,10,10 June 2010,"The Maltese Falcon mayn't be the best movie I have ever seen, but it is along with The Asphalt Jungle, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the African Queen one of my favourite John Huston movies. It is simply superb cinematic entertainment with a sharp and decisive screenplay, rich scoring, crisp direction from the terrific John Huston himself and gorgeous cinematography. The story is very well-paced and done with real panache, I didn't feel there was a wasted moment while watching The Maltese Falcon. And the acting is wonderful, Humphrey Bogart was made for the role of the cynical private detective Sam Spade, while Mary Astor is terrific as the femme-fatale, Sydney Greenstreet makes an impressive debut as Gutman, who lusts after the Black Bird and Peter Lorre is very entertaining as the whiny and effeminate Joel Cairo. Not to mention Walter Huston as the ship's officer. Overall, truly terrific and one to watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Maltese Falcon
2,bkoganbing,"""I Won't Play The Sap For You.""",10,20 January 2006,"The Maltese Falcon has a totally atypical Hollywood history. After two previous filmings of Dashiell Hammett's novel, the third time a classic film was achieved. Usually the original is best and the remakes are the inferior product.These characters that John Huston wrote and breathed life into with his direction are so vital and alive even 65 years after the premiere of The Maltese Falcon. You can watch this one fifty times and still be entertained by it.I'm not sure how the code let this one slip through. Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade is partners with Jerome Cowan in a detective agency Spade and Archer. Client Mary Astor comes into their office requesting help in getting rid of a man who's intruding in on her life. Jerome Cowan as Miles Archer eagerly takes the assignment and gets himself bumped off for his troubles.Cowan is quite the skirt chaser and he certainly isn't the first or the last man to think with his hormones. That's OK because Bogart's been fooling around with his wife, Gladys George. That gives the police, Barton MacLane and Ward Bond, motive enough to suspect Bogart might have had a hand in Cowan's death.As fans of The Maltese Falcon are well aware, there's quite a bit more to the story than that. Bogart's investigation leads him to a crew of adventurous crooks, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr. who are in pursuit of a statue of a Falcon that is said to be encrusted in gold and precious jewels. The Maltese Falcon is a milestone film role for Humphrey Bogart. It is the first time that Bogey was ever first billed in an A picture while he was at Warner Brothers. In fact this is also John Huston's first film as a director. He had previously just been a screenwriter and in fact got an Oscar nomination for the screenplay he wrote here. There are some who will argue that this first film is Huston's best work and I'd be hard up to dispute that.After a long career on stage The Maltese Falcon was the screen debut of Sydney Greenstreet. Greenstreet may be orally flatulent here, but there's no doubt to the menace he exudes while he's on screen. Greenstreet got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley. Greenstreet created quite a gallery of characters for the next ten years, mostly for Warner Brothers.A favorite character of mine in The Maltese Falcon has always been Lee Patrick as Effie, the secretary at Spade&Archer. She's loyal, efficient and crushing out on Bogey big time. This and the part of Mrs. Topper in the television series Topper are Lee Patrick's career roles. I never watch The Maltese Falcon without hoping that Bogey will recognize how really ""precious"" Effie is.The Maltese Falcon will be entertaining people hundreds of years from now. And please no more remakes of this one.",The Maltese Falcon
3,SnoopyStyle,the ultimate classic noir,8,24 August 2014,"Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Miles Archer run a private detective agency in San Francisco. The Maltese Falcon is a golden jewel encrusted statue that the Knight Templars of Malta sent to Charles V of Spain in 1539 that was stolen by pirates. Miss Wanderly comes in to hire Sam to help recover her missing sister for $200. She is to meet Floyd Thursby that night with Miles following her. However Miles is shot dead that night and so is Thursby. Sam had been having an affair with Miles' wife Iva (Gladys George) and is a suspect for everybody. Miss Wanderly is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and she tells Sam that Thursby was her partner coming from HongKong. She begs him for his help but he doesn't trust her. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), with gardenia scented calling cards, offers to pay $5000 for the Maltese Falcon but also held a gun on him. Sam gathers Brigid and Joel Cairo together. She reveals that the 'Fat Man' is around who turns out to be Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet).The crackling dialog comes fast and furious. It's a tough thing to get all at once. It's a great noir hard-boiled film. The character are hardnosed and classic. It's a complicated story with a lot of exposition to follow. That's its biggest weakness and its most enduring fascination. It's a story where everybody is a liar and nobody reveals the truth easily. Peter Lorre is absolutely devilishly creepy in his memorable role. He is part of what makes this a true classic.",The Maltese Falcon
4,Hitchcoc,Just Another Fan,10,5 October 2001,"I wish film were so pure these days. This is a simple (on the surface) murder case which when looked at, has multiple layers of deceit and deception. The ""bird"" itself carries a curse, but where is the bird--is there really a bird? Those who hunt for it form a tenuous bond, devoting their very existences to the search. Bogart stumbles into the case, the lonely, baggage carrying private eye--intrepid to the bitter end. A man not to be bought. Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, multidimensional bad guys--Mary Astor--cool--confident--certain her charms will out. Everyone knows what happens. Comic relief comes in the form of Elisha Cook, the gunsel, overconfident and violent, and in way over his head. This is no longer a movie to me. It's a series of memorable lines, facial expressions and reactions, tension, and tears. Is Sam Spade the friend of the police or an adversary? Do they resent his skills or just him. Does he have a shady past? Miles, his partner, is a fool to Spade, but he is his partner and that is enough. He must play this straight so he can sleep at night. The whole thing is pure atmosphere. Shades of gray. The film noir. Quick feints and moves of a fighter. This is one of those pieces of film heritage which will never grow old.",The Maltese Falcon
5,Prismark10,The Maltese Falcon,9,6 July 2020,"The Maltese Falcon is the classic noir thriller which has been parodied so many times. Hard to believe that this was the third version of Dashiell Hammett's book.It is a film where everyone is shady and that includes its tough cold dark hero Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) who at least plays by some rules. Enough not to annoy the Hay's Code.It also made subtle use of language to highlight that Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) was gay with an emphasis on a perfumed calling and handkerchief. This allowed the movie to escape the censor's scissors.Sam Spade and Miles Archer run a private detective agency in San Francisco. Thanks to a job given to them by Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), Archer is killed. Later a man called Thursby he was supposed to be tailing is also found dead.The police think that Spade might had killed Thursby in revenge. Spade actually had a thing going with Archer's wife which eventually makes him a possible suspect for Archer's death.Spade thinks he is being played by O'Shaughnessy, she is a liar and cannot be trusted.The McGuffin is the Maltese Falcon that everyone is after. Covered in black enamel, few people have realised its true worth. One man who does is Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) a fat man who has been after the falcon for years. Now joined by the creepy Cairo as well as the psychotic Wilmer Cook.The Maltese Falcon was John Huston's debut as a director. It catapulted Bogart as a star, Greenstreet in his film debut became a much imitated cult icon.The plot is complex but fast moving. The romance part between Spade and O'Shaughnessy is hard to believe given she is amoral like so many in this movie. It does give Spade some great lines. After all his partner has died and he needs to do something about it.",The Maltese Falcon
6,mark.waltz,Taking an old story and turning it into the classic which started the official run of film noir.,10,24 April 2013,"Every few years or so, I revisit the classics of Humphrey Bogart, so many of which are films whose titles bring up an image, a quote, a pose or a visual of an unforgettable leading lady. ""The Maltese Falcon"" possesses all of these, a surprising feat because this is the third version of the same story, all gathered together now on a DVD which shows each of their individualities if not varying qualities. While elements of film noir existed in films long before this one came along, this became the definitive detective story upon whose basis the structure of film noir began.While the 1931 version of this is certainly a good film, this version is simply perfect, taking what had already been well done, later messed with (1936's ""Satan Met a Lady"") and fixed it to become an all-time classic. There's no sentiment or subtly to the toughness of the characters in this film, all amoral in one way or another, and all out for themselves. Even Sam Spade's loyal secretary (Lee Patrick) gets a bit more hard boiled than usual, and when the film got a misguided sequel (""The Black Bird"" in 1975), Patrick was back, giving her character a really tough old bird viewpoint that makes you wonder what transpired in this character's life over the intervening 34 years.There's traces of rawness in the dialog that somehow the production code didn't pick up, particularly with some gay references (in a pedophile manner) concerning Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo. Yes, he is sleazier here than any other film he ever did, and that is saying a lot. There's more subtlety for Sydney Greenstreet's fat man than Dudley Digges in the 1931 version, but there's no denying that every time this man appears on screen, he is commanding attention. Elisha Cook Jr. (who also re-appeared in ""The Black Bird"") takes cowardly menace to a new level, creating a film noir archetype that he would repeat many times.The biggest praise for me here goes to Mary Astor as Bridget O'Shaugnessy, the femme fatal, an aging vixen still filled with sex appeal that she would show even in films into the 1950's. Had she not won a well-deserved Oscar for the same year's ""The Great Lie"", she surely would have taken it home for this. (Seeing her in this makes me wonder how the similar looking Alexis Smith would have done had a fourth version been made a few years later.) This version focuses less on the affair between Spade and his partner's wife (Gladys George) and onto the mystery at hand, adding some more detail to each of the sleazy character's personas that makes them even more unforgettable than they had been a decade before.",The Maltese Falcon
7,classicsoncall,"""I can tell you a thousand tales of the men and women who have hunted this evil bird.""",10,4 December 2005,"""Casablanca"" may have the most quoted lines in film history, but ""The Maltese Falcon"", pound for pound, or I should say scene for scene, has the snappiest banter and greatest one liners of any film I've ever viewed. Most of them come from private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), and the tighter the fix, the more clever they are. My personal favorite is ""How'd I kill him, I forget?"", when Polhaus and Dundy (Ward Bond and Barton MacLane) interrogate Spade about the death of his partner. In fact, if you're not paying attention, a lot will sail completely over your head, so it's best to watch the film distraction free and with a scorecard to keep track of the players.The cast is a colorful lot, populated by both good guys and bad guys (and gals). Mary Astor turns up early, and with more than one identity before Spade pins her down as one Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She's on the trail of a fortune disguised as a pawn shop rarity, a black enameled bird rumored to be the fabled Maltese Falcon. Hot on her heels are Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), in league with a sinister Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), and a hot headed gunsel named Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.). Each is a dangerous character, but Spade sizes them up appropriately. Of Wilmer - ""The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter."" Have you ever heard a better description of a crook too big for his britches? Understated though her role may be, Spade's assistant and gal Friday is a sheer delight; Effie Perrine (Lee Patrick) appears to have been around the block a few times, and could be a worthy gumshoe herself. Note how she describes Iva Archer's belongings on the night her husband died, with an eye for detail and a sense of mystery. Sam knows he has an able assistant there, makes you wonder why he hasn't made a move on her himself, though he'd already compromised himself with his partner's wife.That's why it comes as somewhat of a surprise at film's end when Bogie's character comes through it all lily white, willing to throw Brigid over in the name of fair play and standing up for one's murdered partner - ""Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be"". He'd already served up all the suspects to Polhaus in as neat a bundle as the real one, the black statuette, which turns out to have been a stand in for the real thing. It's still out there somewhere, casting it's lure for another gang like Gutman and company. Wondering aloud what the ""dingus"" sitting on Spade's table is, his reply to the detectives sums up what the film's three murders can only hint at - ""The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of"".",The Maltese Falcon
8,gavin6942,The Very Best of the Film Noir Genre,9,30 January 2011,"I would normally put the plot here, but the film is so well known, I will not even bother.Mary Astor stars, looking like a hideous mess. Peter Lorre, one of my all-time favorites, appears as a hapless henchman. And Humphrey Bogart is the legendary Sam Spade, the private detective that trumps all others (though I think Adrian Monk gives him a run for his money for private eyes based in San Francisco).Everything about this film was practically perfect, with Bogart being a very smart yet seedy character, conning people trying to con him, getting the girl, getting blamed for murder, fighting crime... it was just great. The film's best parts are when the dialogue gets out of hand and the characters try to talk over each other and scam one another... such classic personality.",The Maltese Falcon
9,lee_eisenberg,How many movies mention Malta?,10,24 January 2007,"As I have long been into geography and learned early on about Malta, I was fascinated when I realized that ""The Maltese Falcon"" referred to a statuette from that Mediterranean island. But even knowing that can't prepare anyone for what happens in John Huston's adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel. In the role that made him a household name, Humphrey Bogart plays the hard-boiled but good-valued San Francisco detective Sam Spade, embroiled in a search for the title object while investigating a murder. The sense of SF's foggy environs helps in giving the movie a noir feeling, as does the slew of characters: femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), weirdo Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and slimy Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), to name a few.Probably the most effective scene in the movie is when Sam first meets Kasper. While the camera looks straight at Sam, it films Kasper from below, so as to show how fat he is (to make him look menacing, maybe?). And as Sam leaves right after having exploded at Kasper, we see him laughing to himself; after all, a good detective knows how to feign anger.But no matter how you look at it, every part of this movie comes out perfectly. One of Sam's comments applies to movies: ""They don't make 'em like that anymore."" Very good. Also starring Barton MacLane (Gen. Peterson on ""I Dream of Jeannie"") and Elisha Cook Jr.",The Maltese Falcon
10,jboothmillard,The Maltese Falcon,8,30 June 2012,"This is the directorial debut of John Huston (The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen, The Man Who Would Be King), and I had really good things about it, even before I saw it listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, set in 1941 San Francisco, Miss Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes to see private investigators Samuel Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) claiming that her sister has gone missing after being involved with a man called Floyd Thursby, and Archer offers to follow her as she meets this man at night. Spade meets Police Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond) at the scene after being told that Archer was killed, and after calling Wonderly's hotel where she has checked out, and being grilled by Polhaus and his supervisor Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), he is told that Thursby was killed too. After a visit from Archer's wife Iva (Gladys George), who he was having an affair with, Spade meets Wonderly, who reveals her true name as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, she believes Thursby killed Archer, but has no idea who killed his partner, so he agrees to investigate both murders. Back in his office Spade is held at gunpoint by Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) who offers him $5,000 to help find a ""black figure of a bird"", there is a small fight between them, but he is apparently hired, and seeing O'Shaughnessy he sees that she and Cairo know each other. Being followed next morning by Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.), Spade tells him to pass his boss, the ""Fat Man"", aka Kasper Gutman (Oscar nominated Sydney Greenstreet), before he meets him in person, the boss is looking for a valuable bird statue called The Maltese Falcon, and after some attempted escapes he is offered $25,000 and a quarter of the sales from the bird. After having his drink spiked Spade wakes and sees a newspaper article with the departure time of the freighter La Paloma circled, so he goes to the dock, but it was on fire, so he returns to his office, and a man, Captain Jacoby (Walter Huston) bursts in clutching something wrapped in newspaper, he falls down dead, and the wrapped item is The Maltese Falcon. He phones Brigid to arrange a meeting to give her the bird, and after the phone goes dead he rushes to the address she gave him, an empty lot, so he returns home to find her, as well as Gutman, Cairo and Wilmer waiting for him, with guns pointed. Spade will not accept the $10,000 from Gutman unless he can hand in someone to take the responsibility for the murders of Archer, Thursby and Jacoby, he suggests Wilmer, and after negotiations this is agreed, and in a fight he is knocked out and given all the details he needs to make it convincing. The next day office secretary Effie Perine (Lee Patrick) brings in The Maltese Falcon for Gutman, but he is devastated to find out that the black statue is a fake, so he and Cairo decide to head back to Istanbul to continue their search for the real thing, and despite his feelings for her, Spade turns in Brigid for the murder of Archer. Also starring James Burke as Luke, Murray Alper as Frank Richman and John Hamilton as Bryan. Bogart established himself with this role as a leading actor, having done mostly supporting roles before, and with a witty script by Huston he really delivers his lines well, and the supporting cast are all good too, with Astor playing against type being the Femme Fetale, and Greenstreet proving himself a worthy Oscar nominee with subtle villain performance. I will confess I thought this was going to be different, I was expecting a gangster style treasure hunt film, and I didn't fully understand everything going on, but what I did pick up on was worth watching, it is a worthwhile classic film noir. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay for Huston. Humpherey Bogart was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 27 on The World's Greatest Actor, ""The stuff that dreams are of made."" was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!",The Maltese Falcon
11,Tweekums,Classic Film Noir,9,30 December 2008,"I saw this classic film for the first time yesterday and having seen it I wonder why I waited so long to see it. The story was interesting and convoluted enough to keep me intrigued till the end.Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a private detective in San Fransisco. As the film starts a woman comes to his office telling him that her sister has gone missing in the company of a rather dubious man. Sam's partner Miles Archer volunteers for what should be a simple case in order to impress the client. Things don't go according to plan as later that night Archer is shot dead and shortly after the police tell Spade the man he was following also turns up dead putting Spade on top of the suspects list for the second murder. He soon learns that his client hadn't been telling the truth; there was no sister in fact the man she wanted following was a business partner who had double crossed her. When he returns to his office he is accosted by a man called Joel Cairo who says he is looking for a figure of a black bird that he is willing to pay $5000 for. It turns out that several people are searching for the mysterious black bird, which apparently is far more valuable than previously admitted. I won't say more about the actual story as that would spoil the rather surprising ending.If you are a fan of classic films or detective fiction you really should watch this, the story is gripping, the ending is memorable and the acting is very good. For its time is was unusual for films to feature good guys that weren't really that good but subject to the same temptations that real people might be.",The Maltese Falcon
12,ma-cortes,"Absorbing and worthy suspense film about blackmails , killings , corruption and strong intrigue",8,14 March 2015,"This one of the all-time grand films , a classic Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings and powerhouse filmmaking , at John Huston's first effort directorial . This is a story as explosive as his blazing automatics . Womanizer Sam Sapade is a two-fisted and cynical private detective operating in the big city . When his secretary tells him the new customer (Mary Astor) waiting outside his office is a knockout, he wastes no time before seeing her. It turns out she's a knockout with money. And she wants to spend it on his services as a private detective . This lovely dame with dangerous lies employs the services of the notorious private detective . She has some story about wanting to protect her sister. Neither he nor his partner, Miles Archer, believes it. But with the money she's paying, who cares? The job proves to be more dangerous than either of them expected. It involves not just the lovely dame with the dangerous lies, but also the sweaty Casper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet) , the fey Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) , and the thuggish young Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr) . Three crooks, and all of them are looking for the statuette of a black bird they call the Maltese Falcon . Spade is quickly caught up in the mystery and intrigue of a statuette known as the Maltese Falcon . As Sam fights to get hold of a black bird ¨the stuff that dreams are made¨ (a line suggested by Humphrey Bogart was voted as the #14 movie quote by the American Film Institute) . This first-rate and entertaining picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows Dashiell Hammett's book fairly closely otherwise , he also wrote ¨The thin man¨. Twisted film Noir about murders , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the novel ¨The Maltese Falcon¨¨and screen-written by the same Huston . Frustrated at seeing his script for Juárez (1939) rewritten by Paul Muni, the film's star, John Huston vowed that from then on he would direct his own screenplays and therefore not have to see them get meddled with. He was fortunate in that he had a staunch ally in the form of producer Henry Blanke who was happy to fulfill Huston's wish. Word-for-word and scene-for-scene virtually the same as the original novel. It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail .The climactic confrontation scene lasts nearly 20 minutes, one-fifth of the entire running time of the film. It involves all five principal characters, and filming required over one full week . Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the tough-talking P.I. Although George Raft was originally cast as Sam Spade , he allegedly turned it down because it was ""not an important picture,"" taking advantage of a clause in his contract that said he did not have to work on remakes . For decades this film could not be legally shown on US television stations because of its underlying suggestions of ""illicit"" sexual activity among the characters (i.e., O'Shaughnessy's promiscuity, indications that Joel Cairo was a homosexual). Much of the movie is filmed over Humphrey Bogart's shoulder so that the audience can be in on his point of view. His scenes with Mary Astor are awesome and at their best compared to those he subsequently shared with Lauren Bacall in ¨Dark passage¨ , ¨Key Largo¨ , ¨The big sleep¨ and ¨To have and to have not¨ . The couple Bogart-Astor throws in enough sparks to ignite several lighters . This was the first pairing of cynical Humphrey Bogart and Femme Fatale Mary Astor . Mary Astor's off-screen notoriety was instrumental in her casting , she had been in several scandals concerning affairs she had been involved in during her marriage. And she was having an affair with John Huston during the making of the film. Magnificent support cast , here was the first pairing of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, who would go on to make nine more movies together. Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by Arthur Edeson and magnificent musical score by the classic Adolph Deutsch . And also shown in horrible computer-colored version . The motion picture was masterfully directed by John Huston ; filming was completed in two months at a cost of less than $300,000. A former version in 1931 by Roy Del Ruth , it was also pretty good starred by Bebe Daniels as Ruth Wonderly , Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade , Dudley Digges as Casper Gutman and Una Merkel as Effie Perine . In fact , Warner Bros. planned to change the name of the film to ""The Gent from Frisco"" because the novel's title had already been used for this The Maltese Falcon (1931) , the studio eventually agreed to keep the original title at John Huston's insistence.",The Maltese Falcon
13,moonspinner55,Bogie as Sam Spade in John Huston's film debut...,6,29 October 2005,"Dashiell Hammett story becomes much-acclaimed directorial debut for John Huston, with definitive role for Humphrey Bogart as hard-boiled detective Sam Spade, here solving the murder of his partner while chasing down a priceless artifact which dates back to the 1500s. Third filming of this story (the others were in 1931 and 1936, the latter as ""Satan Met a Lady"") is set in San Francisco yet features practically no location footage (and the stock shots at the beginning are painful to look at). Set-bound noir seems awfully constricted, but Bogart is fully into his role and has a great time; supporting performances from Peter Lorre (a perfumed question mark) and Sydney Greenstreet are also excellent. Noir-addicts swear by the film, but it never really catches fire. **1/2 from ****",The Maltese Falcon
14,blanche-2,Such stuff as dreams are made on,10,27 May 2007,"Warner Brothers must have been really surprised at the rendering of this material in the hands of John Huston after the first ""Maltese Falcon"" starring Ricardo Cortez and the flippant ""Satan Met a Lady"" starring Warren William. What makes a classic? Well, there's a little chemistry involved, so it's not possible to totally define, but the 1941 ""Maltese Falcon"" fits the definition.Having seen the two misfires of this, the dramatic tone Huston took with the script serves the material very well. In the 1931 version, Cortez as Sam Spade is a relaxed playboy, and the emphasis seems to be on how many women he can shuffle around; the second is more on the style of ""The Thin Man,"" with Warren William treating it all as a big joke. But in this ""Maltese Falcon,"" the stakes are high, the danger is real, and the people are treacherous. We have a world-weary, no-nonsense detective in Bogart's Sam Spade, one who ""may not be as crooked as you think I am."" Instead of an obviously ruthless, sexy woman in the form of Bebe Daniels or the wide-eyed ingénue of Bette Davis, there's classy, serene, and beautiful Mary Astor - though Spade spots her shy demeanor as a put-on, he's still intrigued.Both Bogart and Astor are excellent, but two people bring this film up to a level undreamed of by previous directors - Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Lorre as Joel Cairo is pure slime, and his scene with Ms. O'Shaughnessy (Astor) in Spade's office is one of the best in the film. Guttman (Greenstreet) has greed and obsession written all over his face, and Wilmer, his resident thug who's like a son to him, is incredibly cruel for the fun of it. Greenstreet and Lorre were in their day and in their way as big a team as Bogie and Bacall. Every film in which they appear is a treat.Huston lets each actor go to the extremes of his or her character's personality, thereby letting the tension build in the ambiguity of the situation. Is the Falcon story true? Spade chuckles over it. O'Shaughnessy wants him to get it for her. Can she be trusted? How far will Guttman go to possess it? And what of Miles Archer and Thursby? Who killed them? And how does Spade feel about his partner being killed? He is, after all, having an affair with Miles' wife (Gladys George) though he doesn't seem too interested in her now.All the performances are wonderful, including Lee Patrick as Sam's secretary. In this version, she's very capable and helpful, and while she doesn't seem to be romantically involved with Sam, she's fond of him.If you want to see what makes a classic, take a look at the two earlier versions of this film and then watch this one. Then you'll see for sure, as Shakespeare says and Spade paraphrases, ""the stuff that dreams are made on.""",The Maltese Falcon
15,Quinoa1984,The first filmed noir story is a pure gem after so many years,10,22 February 2003,"John Huston's first film, The Maltese Falcon, from Dashell Hammiet's novel, makes itself a classic on the first watch with two things- great story development and a great lead/breakthrough.  Bogart, in his first role after a decade of B pictures, bursts with a range and scope comparable to Casablanca, and is as memorable as private investigator Sam Spade.  After Spade's partner is shot following taking a case involving a Mr. Miles, Spade gets thrown into an intrigue, a deal, involving a gold encrusted bird.  But there are indeed other parties as interested as him in finding it.  Along with Bogart, Peter Locke, Sydney Greenstreet, and his female counterpart Mary Astor, all shine and make the cold hearted and darkly funny moments last after over half a century.  As noteworthy as mystery films truly get. A++",The Maltese Falcon

New York opening at the Strand: 3 October 1941. Australian release: 5 November 1942 (sic). 9,030 feet. 100 minutes. (Warner DVD is a 10/10).COMMENT: Although both film versions received rave reviews in The New York Times, only the Del Ruth version could be counted as a box- office success on its first release. The Huston film was lucky to earn back its comparatively high negative cost of $381,000. Warner's big successes of 1941-42 were Sergeant York, which returned a colossal $6.1 million in gross domestic rentals, and Yankee Doodle Dandy with $4.8 million. The Man Who Came to Dinner, King's Row, Captains of the Clouds, In This Our Life, The Bride Came C.O.D., Dive Bomber, The Sea Wolf and The Strawberry Blonde were also enormous, multi-million dollar box-office winners for the studio.The Maltese Falcon didn't figure at all and would be forgotten today were it not for the cult status of Humphrey Bogart and — to a lesser degree — John Huston. All the same, it comes a surprise to find that among film lovers, sixty times more people have seen this version than have enjoyed the original, even though both films are equally entertaining. While few would contend that Digges, Mattiesen and Frye outclass Greenstreet, Lorre and Cook, the decision is close. On the other hand, as for Long versus Cowan, Merkel v. Patrick, Todd v. George, and Elliott v. MacLane, the winners are plainly Del Ruth's. Yet Bond is certainly more forceful than MacDonald, and Walter Huston has it all over Borgato, simply because he has dialogue. So we come down to the principals. Which set you prefer here is simply a matter of taste. I prefer the Cortez-Daniels combination. The 1931 movie still has a gripping noir atmosphere despite the fact that Cortez's impeccably suave, super-pleased with himself, egotistical private eye runs somewhat against type. There is no self-agonizing here. The Cortez character is solely concerned with looking out for number one. The ruthless heroine is also far more stridently hard-boiled, whereas Mary Astor turns her into a lady- like, high society type. As for directorial finesse and production values, the Huston movie is definitely the winner. All the same, despite his smaller budget, Del Ruth gives Huston a good run for his money.",The Maltese Falcon

A very complex woman, Astor first comes across as sympathetic and vulnerable, but as the film goes on, she is shown to be in the thick of murder and intrigue. For sure, she is certainly the femme fatale here. Lee Patrick is convincing as the widow of Cowan, who really loved Spade.

18,wes-connors,Full of Sound and Fury,8,29 August 2007,"Humphrey Bogart plays grimacing detective Sam Spade in John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon"" - a classic film; and, it deserves that status, in many respects. The performances and ""noir look"" of the film help tremendously. Peter Lorre's was the best characterization - and, he's great with ""The Fat Man"" Sydney Greenstreet. Mr. Bogart was memorable, as was Mary Astor, but, I didn't see any special magic in their relationship (perhaps none was intended). It was nice to see Bogart paired with a woman closer to his own age. The weakest element in ""The Maltese Falcon"" is a story that never really takes a stranglehold on your mind; which is made worse by the fact that it always seems like it is about to - like there is some mysterious all-connecting story element to be revealed (perhaps none was intended). ******** The Maltese Falcon (10/3/41) John Huston ~ Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet",The Maltese Falcon
19,Coventry,Flawless film-noirThe Maltese Falcon is a prototype of perfect cinema!,10,30 March 2004,"(Small Spoilers included) Making his debut at the age of 35 with an absolute milestone, John Huston's career began pretty spectacular. The novel already was adapted once in 1931, but Huston's version catapulted that one straight into oblivion. Believe itthis film is as close to perfection as one can get. An unfriendly attack towards human greed, filled with intrigues, unfaithful characters and constant sarcasm. Humphrey Bogart is uniquely cast as the dry private detective who gets caught in a web of money, betrayal, theft and even murder. Pivot object in the whole story is a very valuable statue of a black bird. Several parties are after this treasure and they're all prepared to go very far for it. Bogart is the only man you can imagine playing Sam Spade He gives an almost natural arrogance to his character and his consciousness isn't exactly clean' either He seems to have no emotions (when his partner gets shotor when he has to make a choice between his love and his credibility as a detective) and he isn't exactly sensible with women, neither (`When you're slappedyou'll take and like it'). The Maltese Falcon breathes an atmosphere that is purely film-noir and the screenplay  by John Huston himself  is extremely compelling and it requires a certain level of intelligence. The dry humor is terrifically oppressed and you have the idea you never really get to know any of the characters, which is great! Besides Bogart, the Maltese Falcon can also count on the solid performances by Peter Lorre (with the most creative haircut in his entire career) and Sydney Greenstreet, who also made his debut in this film. All three appeared on the screen together again a year after this, in the equally brilliant `Casablanca'. The wonderfully beautiful Mary Astor plays Bogart's love interest Brigid O'Shaughnessy and completes the perfect cast. If you want to become a cinema expert, you can't afford to miss this one. Essential viewing for anyone who ever showed the least bit of interest in cinema.",The Maltese Falcon
20,sunwarrior13,A Classic Detective Thriller,10,25 October 2012,"The Maltese Falcon film noir based on the novel of the same title by Dashiell Hammett.Directed by John Huston,it features Humphrey Bogart as private investigator Sam Spade and Mary Astor as his ""femme fatale"" client. Gladys George, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet co-star in key supporting roles.The story follows a San Francisco private detective and his dealings with three unscrupulous adventurers, all of whom are competing to obtain a jewel-encrusted falcon statuette.Sam Spade is a hard-boiled San Francisco private eye who can be as unscrupulous as the next guy but also adheres to his own personal code of honor. Into the offices of the Spade & Archer detective agency sweeps a Miss Wonderly, who offers a large retainer to Sam and his partner Miles Archer if they'll protect her from someone named Floyd Thursby. The detectives believe neither Miss Wonderly nor her story, but they believe her money. Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby. Miss Wonderly's real name turns out to be Brigid O'Shaughnessey, and, as the story continues, Sam is also introduced to the effeminate Joel Cairo and the fat, erudite Kasper Gutman. It turns out that Brigid, Cairo and Gutman are all international scoundrels, all involved in the search for a foot-high, jewel-encrusted statuette in the shape of a falcon. Though both Cairo and Gutman offer Spade small fortunes to find the ""black bird,"" they are obviously willing to commit mayhem and murder towards that goal: Gutman, for example, drugs Spade and allows his ""gunsel"" Wilmer to kick and beat the unconscious detective.Suspenseful, labyrinthine, and brilliantly cast, The Maltese Falcon is one of the most influential noirs.This film is still the tightest, sharpest, and most cynical of Hollywood's official deathless classics, bracingly tough even by post-Tarantino standards.And it is among the most important and influential movies to emerge from the Hollywood system as significant in some ways as its contemporary, Citizen Kane It's an action movie of sorts, at least by implication: the characters always seem keyed up, right on the verge of erupting into violence. This is a turning-point picture in several respects: John Huston made his directorial debut here and Bogart, who had mostly played bad guys, was a last-minute substitution for George Raft, who must have been kicking himself for years afterward. This is the role that made Bogart a star and established his trend-setting antihero persona. A classic movie that becomes better with multiple viewings indeed.",The Maltese Falcon

22,hitchcockthelegend,"The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter.",10,31 December 2008,"Sam Spade is a tough private detective who gets involved in a murderous hunt for The Maltese Falcon, a legendary statuette thought to contain diamonds.What can I possibly say about this version of The Maltese Falcon that hasn't been said, written and studied by the greatest film critics and industry members before? Well nothing by way of new stuff or a differing slant on the plot, I can merely concur and hopefully jolt prospective first time viewers into believing the reputation afforded this stunning piece of cinema.First off I have to let it be known that this is far from being my favourite Bogart movie, in fact it's not even my favourite Bogart movie from 1941!, it's well trumped in my affections by ""High Sierra"", but few films ever get as close to being perfect as ""The Maltese Falcon"" clearly is. The source from Dashiell Hammett is first rate, and yet it took someone like John Huston (director and screenwriter) to bring it triumphantly together. It had been adapted for the screen twice before with less than favourable results, but Huston, working tightly from Hammett's dialogue driven astuteness, crafts a claustrophobic, shadowy classic amongst classics, that in the process laid the cornerstone for what became known as essential film noir.You will search in vain for faults here, every scene is as tight as a duck's bottom, not one filler scene is in this picture. The cast are across the board perfect in performances, Bogart (Spade) is peerless, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet (film debut) and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out, but every other member of this cast also add something worthwhile. The plot (of which I'm ""so"" not going to summarise for you) is complex to a degree, but really it all makes sense, you do not need to be Albert Einstein to knit the twisters nicely together. Also don't be fooled into thinking this is a film devoid of humour either, it has deadly wry smirks popping up all over the place, ok so they may be the sort of smirks brought about by devilish unease of admiration, but rest assured they are valid and integral to the pic's classic standing.I could go on fawning but I really don't need too, The Academy may well have saw fit to not award this picture any awards for 1941, but time is an immeasurable force sometimes, and time now shows that The Maltese Falcon stands proud as not only a titan of cinematic entertainment, but also of technical movie brilliance. 10/10",The Maltese Falcon
23,Doylenf,The definition of detective film noir...excellent performances by all...,8,23 July 2006,"""When a man's partner is killed, a man's expected to do something about it."" So says HUMPHREY BOGART in his star-making role under John Huston's direction in this taut thriller from a Raymond Chandler novel.Bogart handles all of his crisp, tough guy dialog in fine form, very expressive in the way he gazes suspiciously at the lying MARY ASTOR as the story's femme fatale--or in the sly way he deals with SYDNEY GREENSTREET, PETER LORRE or ELISHA COOK, JR. He actually becomes Sam Spade, as if he understands the character inside out.And contrary to others, I have to say that Astor (while looking a little matronly with that unbecoming '40s hair-do), does an equally fine job as the conniving woman who's at the bottom of a greedy plot. Astor has some great scenes where the camera looks into her eyes and sees all the complexities beneath the surface as she deals with others in a very nervous manner while she spins a web of lies that are making her uneasy. She's brilliant in the role.The cast does a tremendous job of bringing the story to life--and so, of course, does John Huston, who has firm control over the style of this extraordinary film noir. Interesting that he gave a bit role to his famous father, Walter Huston, who has a brief part as Captain Jacoby, clutching the sought after icon before he dies from a gunshot wound.Elisha Cook, Jr. does a standout job as Wilmer, tears streaking down his face when he has to take verbal abuse from Sam Spade. And, of course, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet were so impressive that they were paired in many a Warner film after this.By all means, well worth seeing and enjoying, fully deserving its reputation as a classic film noir.",The Maltese Falcon
24,LeonLouisRicci,Iconaclastic,8,1 June 2013,"This is arguably the first Film-Noir. While it is a groundbreaking style of slick sensibilities, Camera Angles, and crisp Performances, the witty rhythmic Script is foremost the Star here. There is a surrealist, not a realism to the Dialog. A Pulped Up patter that can be found in the best Crime Fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James Cain. In real life People don't talk like that. ""What do you want me to do, learn to stutter"" answers Sam Spade. The Film is iconic Bogart and his supporters are along for the ride. He is in virtually every scene and it is his ship that the barnacles attach. Everything is dependent on the Character of Detective as he wanders through this wondering about what to do and who to do it to next.Undeniably infectious, things move at a rapid pace and is fascinating to watch. Not without flaws, such as a wordy, wondering Story and some stiffness. Still it is an important Movie, although it suffers from being Studio bound and some rather annoying, feathery Music. The end speech where Spade verbalizes his reasons for his actions is rather badly Written and Acted and almost doesn't fit with the sharpness that led us there. In short it feels tacked on and simplistic. But the rather weak ending is not enough to keep this from being a new slice of Cinema for the Forties and beyond. It is worth most of its relentless praise. There is a lot here to relish and only a few things that keep this from Greatness.",The Maltese Falcon
25,CinemaSerf,Lorre & Greenstreet steal the show...,7,23 September 2021,"Recently re-released in glorious 4K (nope, I couldn't tell the difference, either) but, hey - any excuse to see this wonderful crime noir on a big screen again is OK with me. When ""Brigid"" (Mary Astor) approaches PI ""Sam Spade"" (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner ""Archer"" (Jerome Cowan) with a dodgy sounding story about her sister being kidnapped by her older lover, they don't believe a word of it - but $200 (and a bit of a shine to the lady from ""Archer"") gets them to go through the motions. Well: they were right about one thing - her story was riddled with holes, but not so many as ""Archer"" becomes, and soon ""Spade"" and the police are trying to track down/avoid the murderer whilst trying to establish some sort of motive. Enter the stars of the film, for me, anyway - the uber-sleazy ""Joel Cairo"" (Peter Lorre) and ""Gutman"" (Sydney Greenstreet), the avuncular gentleman who has most of the pieces of the puzzle and who is as dangerous and devious as he is charming and disarming... Will ""Spade"" get to the bottom of the mystery before he ends up brown bread? That's where the film falls down a bit - there is precious little jeopardy to the plot; indeed the last fifteen or twenty minutes are just a little disappointing - rushed even. Bogey is superb in the part, though - his portrayal reeks of a wonderful cynic, a seen-it-all-before ground down sort of man who takes his first drink of the day from the same glass he took his last from the day before and Astor is efficient, though not terribly engaging, as the lynchpin upon which much of the film depends. It's 80 years old now - and I still think the use of a strong score from Adolph Deutsch, some wonderfully evocative lighting and effects (it rains quite a lot!) and, of course, a strong cast with a good story, takes some beating.",The Maltese Falcon

A typical early exchange comes in the wake of Archer's murder when, after ascertaining that Archer was following Floyd Thursby Barton MacLane's cop asks Bogie 'Why was he tailing him?' to which Bogie replies 'He wanted to find out where he lived' in that laconic way he practically patented. The plot itself is fast moving and reasonably intriguing but watching it today most of the fun is in the ensemble playing and spotting Hollyood regulars like MacLane, Ward Bond, Gail Patrick, Elisha Cooke, etc plus the finest threesome since the Nat King Cole trio in Bogie, Lorre and Greenstreet. This was Huston's first stint as writer-director and arguably he never eclipsed it.",The Maltese Falcon

Complicating matters is the arrival of two men, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), seeking a priceless falcon statuette that Spade's client may know the whereabouts of.One of those classic films I can watch over and over. I'm a big fan of Dashiell Hammett's novel and this is by far the best version of it. The script by John Huston (also his directorial debut) is flawless with all of Hammett's best and punchiest lines included. The cast is extraordinary. Sam Spade is one of Humphrey Bogart's most iconic screen roles, perhaps second only to Rick Blaine. Despite two other actors playing the part before him (Ricardo Cortez and 'sort of' Warren William), it's a role Bogie made his own and now it's unimaginable to think of someone else as Sam Spade. Sydney Greenstreet makes his film debut as Kasper Gutman. Elisha Cook, Jr. is the tough-talking gunsel Wilmer. Signature roles for both. The great Peter Lorre is the effete Joel Cairo. Underrated Lee Patrick plays Spade's girl Friday Effie. Nice support from Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as cops who hassle Spade. If I could find any fault with the amazing cast, it would be Mary Astor simply because she's physically wrong for the part. Her character is supposed to be ""a knockout."" While physical beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I can't see anybody thinking moderately-attractive Astor fits the description. Still, she brings to life one of film noir's greatest femme fatales.Tough, smart, fast-talking, energetically-paced classic with many enduring characters, lines, and scenes.

28,zardoz-13,"The Movie That Dreams Are Made Of , , ,",10,23 October 2011,"Scenarist John Huston made an auspicious directorial debut with the third version of Dashiell Hammett's murder mystery ""The Maltese Falcon"" featuring Humphrey Bogart in only his second starring role. This version cleaves closest to its literary source. Appropriately enough, Huston received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing. This Henry Blanke and Hal B. Wallis produced crime thriller also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Not a bad way for Huston to embark a prestigious career as a Hollywood helmer. Like most of Huston's pictures, ""The Maltese Falcon"" wraps up with a tainted ending. Meaning, the initial objective is never achieved. ""The Maltese Falcon"" concerns an international search for a valuable heirloom, the titular object, a black enameled falcon with gold and an array of precious jewels encrusted underneath the outer layer of enamel. This handsome falcon was designed as a gift for a greater power. People kill over the possession of this object. One character calculates its wealth at over $100-thousand dollars.As the film unfolds, a well-dressed dame, Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor of ""Don Juan""), enters the offices of Archer and Spade. She spins a yarn as wild as a march hare about trying to get his sister away from the clutches of a married man. Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) listens attentively to her tale. Spade's partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan of ""High Sierra"") barges in without warning and apologizes. Sam summarizes Brigid's story and that she will meet Thurby in the lobby of a hotel. Immediately, an enamored Archer insists that he will be in the lobby, too, keeping a close eye on her. O'Shaughnessy pays Spade and Archer the sum of $200 dollars. Later that night, Miles is walking down Bush Street when he confronts an off-screen person and watches in surprise as the individual whips out a Webley revolver and put a bullet in his pump. When the authorities find Archer is sprawled dead on a slope after crashing through a fence. The police call Spade a little after 2 AM, and he shows up at the murder scene about fifteen minutes later. After he gets back to his apartment, he finds Detective Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond of ""The Searchers"") and Lieutenant of Detectives Dudy (Barton MacLane of ""Prison Break"") knocking on his door. They grill him about Floyd Thursby's murder near the Hotel Florence. Naturally, Spade cannot prove his whereabouts, but he isn't taken in for questioning. The following day, Miles Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George of ""The Roaring Twenties"") shows up at his office dressed modestly in black with a veiled hat. She asks Sam if he shot Miles. Spade chuckles and sends her packing. Although he doesn't do anything ostensibly illegal, Spade looks like he could be amoral, particularly because he is cuckolding his partner in his sexual relationship with the wife. Finally, he corners Brigid again and demands to know her real name and tells her that they believed her $200 instead of her story. He pleads for Spade to shield her from the police. Things grow complicated when three men show up and tell a story about the black bird and its rich heritage.Huston assembles a first-class cast, including Mary Astor as the treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy who harbors no qualms about lying. Peter Lorre is appropriately unctuous as the obviously homosexual Joel Cairo. Indeed, in the classic Dashiell Hammett novel, written in 1930, Cairo was described as 'queer.' Incidentally, Hammett has worked for the Pinkerton Detective Agency so he knew a thing or two about private eyes. Lorre leaves little to the imagination during his initial visit to Spade's office; he strokes an immaculate cane and rubs the handle across his lips. The Production Code Administration prohibited the depiction of homosexuals in movies when ""The Maltese Falcon"" was produced, so Huston and Lorre had to rely on physical and verbal discretion to communicate his gender identity. Sixty-year old Sidney Greenstreet made an equally memorable thespian debut as the loquacious, rotund but ruthless Kasper Gutman. As his two-gun toting bodyguard Wilmer, Elisha Cook, Jr. provided some quiet but ineffectual menace. Of course, Bogart ascends smoothly above the pack as the suave but shifty Samuel Spade. Spade is heroic, but little about him is virtuous. Humphrey Bogart has a field day with the character. When the police question him after the murder of Floyd Thursby, Spade asks them to remind him how he killed him..""The Maltese Falcon"" is ten times better than ""High Sierra"" in part because Bogart is largely in control or recovering quickly.

30,Boba_Fett1138,More of a mystery than a film-noir but it's a great movie.,8,11 March 2008,"Well, to be perfectly honest, this movie slightly disappointed me. I expected to get to see one of the ultimate film-noir pictures. However I've seen movies that are way less known but also just simply better than this movie is. But in all honesty, this movie of course still was a great one to watch, mostly because of its well constructed story and the cast of the movie. My expectations for it were of course probably just too high.It's a movie with a great constructed and build up story but as far as film-noir's go, I've just seen better movies. As a matter of fact I don't even really regard this movie as a film-noir. The story and atmosphere remains too light for it. It's more fair calling this movie a mystery movie in my opinion.For it's time the movie was quite new and genre re-defining with its storytelling. Perhaps the very reason why this movie is being considered to be an important and classic movie. Just like ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't THE best movie ever made, it was still one of the most important movies ever made because of the way it redefined film-making and story-telling within a movie.The characters are all being played by great actors but yet their characters all remain sort of flat. I known it's one of the points of a mystery movie to have mysterious shallow characters in it, in order to maintain the movie its mystery and a certain level of unpredictability but in this case it just isn't in the movie its best interest. Nevertheless you sort of tend to forget this because of the fine actors that are portraying the characters. Humphrey Bogart is at his best as a private detective. What I like about his character is that he is a person with his flaws and he is far from a straight honest man but he still has his morals and more noble side. He also teams up for the very first time with Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. When the 3 of them are together in a movie, it's always something special (also see ""Casablanca"".) As a matter of fact, this was Sydney Greenstreet's very first movie role. Quite amazing considering that he already was well in his 60's at the time. Nevertheless he performs as if he has done nothing else in his life before.It was also John Huston's very first directing job. This movie might also very well be his best known work but it isn't his greatest made movie in my opinion. His movie's such as ""Key Largo"" and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" are even better, despite being not as well known or world wide appreciated.Perhaps more of an important movie than it is really a perfect classic.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Maltese Falcon

I forget,10,4 July 2010,"I haven't read the novel, but I hear that it is even better than this, so it must be excellent(also, I understand that this is a close adaptation, and the only one at the time). This is one of those films that you hear you must take in at least once, so I was ecstatic to find this on sale. While I admit to overall liking The Big Sleep more than this(on account of Bacall, the romance and the relationship between her and Bogie... other than those three, they are amazing in all the same ways), this had me gripped throughout. I *love* noir, and this is one of the best of them, and required viewing for any fan of the genre. The femme fatales, and in general strong women, the funny, clever, sharp and swiftly delivered dialog, the editing and cinematography(the angles, the early pan onto the floor to reveal what it says on the window as the sunlight renders it readable there, and how incredibly *smooth* it all is) and the plot. There are a few holes in the story; however, this moves so fast, and you have to pay close attention to follow it all(and it won't hurt to treat yourself to additional exposures), that you barely realize this until afterwards, and it doesn't take away from the enjoyment at all. With deception at every turn, Sam Spade attempts to locate the legendary Maltese Falcon, with law officials convinced that he's involved with the death of two men. Humphrey is charming as always, Astor is compelling(you can sense that there's something to her role beyond the first impression she makes), Greenstreet is amiable(to an extent!), and this is Lorre at his sleaziest(without ceasing to be amusing). Elisha Cook Jr. is spot-on; I could go on. The mystery is engaging, and this is tense and suspenseful. There is disturbing content in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with an informative and researched commentary by the male lead's biographer Eric Lax, the documentaries Becoming Attractions and One Magnificent Bird(I will comment on them on their own sections here on IMDb), an authentic theater-going experience(when this movie was shown originally, there would be shorts, animated and live-action, before the feature presentation), meaning, The Gay Parisian, Breakdowns of 1941, Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt, Meet John Doughboy(all of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), and finally, a trailer for this and one for Sgt.

And if you can follow the plot of ""Falcon,"" you're either smarter or paying more attention than I.But I don't know that anyone watches movies like this for the plot, and while I didn't see the ""Great Film"" in this that others seem to see, I still appreciate its place in screen history for kick-starting two things: film noir and the career of Humphrey Bogart.As long as Bogie's on screen, no one else really even matters, not even Mary Astor in a sizzling role.

And even though the earlier version was quite good, this one is even better with Peter Lorre (as ""Joel Cairo""), Sydney Greenstreet (""Kasper Gutman""), Lee Patrick (""Effie Perine"") along with the aforementioned Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor excelling in their individual roles. Again, while I liked the Maltese Falcon of 1931, this particular movie is a pure delight in every way and for that reason I highly recommend this film to all viewers and have rated it accordingly.

Humphrey Bogart plays detective Sam Spade whose partner is murdered and he becomes a suspect. Bogart's first big role played extremely cynical as he faces off against numerous adversaries in search of the Maltese Falcon. This is a valuable object that supposedly hides jewels. He prides himself on his ability to disarm potential suspects through their own false confidence, including those whom he was introduced on good will. Mary Astor hires him and becomes laughably suspicious as he mocks her distracting behavior. She will face hard facts and realizations when Bogart solves the case. Interesting villains played by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr. They are in search of the Falcon and all have different encounters with Bogart. Greenstreet plays the sinister leader whom makes an offer to Bogart with regards to the Falcon. Lorre and Cook are all too ready to pull a gun and suffer the consequences. They stalk Bogart but fail to realize that he is several paces ahead of them in terms of skill. The murders are all in connection upon what one can achieve without thought or concern of what they ultimate take from the victim. Score: 10 / 10",The Maltese Falcon

36,HotToastyRag,"One of the early, famous noirs",5,10 March 2019,"""The stuff that dreams are made of,"" is the most memorable and quotable line from The Maltese Falcon, but this two-hour, dialogue-heavy film noir has a lot more to it than a sentence fragment mumbled by Humphrey Bogart. If you need three good reasons to see them: John Huston's directorial debut, Humphrey Bogart's first ""trenchcoat"" character, and Mary Astor's famous turn as a femme fatale. The fourth reason doesn't count, since if you blink you'll miss it. Walter Huston, for good luck in his son's debut, puts in a cameo.John Huston, previously establishing himself as a screenwriter and the son of famous actor Walter, put on his director's cap and pioneered one of the earliest noir films. All the canted angles, shadowy lighting, and close, careful framing that you've come to know and love can be traced back to a handful of films in the early '40s, one of which being The Maltese Falcon. For his leading man, a man who had to come across as ""too cool for school"" before that phrase was invented, who was selfish, used as often as he was taken, and treated ladies like dames, John Huston cast Humphrey Bogart. This was Humph's big break, since prior to the anti-hero Sam Spade, he was always cast as straight villains, as in The Petrified Forest, Brother Orchid, and The Roaring Twenties. Because of John Huston, Humph was elevated to Hollywood royalty. He went on to Casablanca, The Big Sleep, and other ""trenchcoat"" characters that were all variations of Sam Spade and all placed on a pedestal by the male population because he didn't need a woman to feel good about himself.Mary Astor, a beautiful, vulnerable client who comes to Humph and his partner Jerome Cowan for help, gives a wonderfully memorable performance. She's obviously hiding something, but until the movie progresses, the audience don't know what it is. Humph catches on, but pretty soon after, romance gets in the way. 1941 was Mary Astor's year for good acting, since she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for The Great Lie. Check out both if you want to see a range of her acting. Also included in the supporting cast are Sydney Greenstreet in his first movie, who was known to pair up with Humph in later films, Gladys George, a tool to show Humph's coldness towards women, Peter Lorre, who's just weird and creepy, Barton MacLane, Lee Patrick, Elisha Cook Jr., before his television career, and Ward Bond, who's just everywhere, isn't he?",The Maltese Falcon

It's too dated to be of entertainment value today.I can see Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade is influential. But the other performances are kind of stiff.The directing by John Huston isn't great. People stand stiffly around while a very fake punch takes place between two people. The action is abrupt and comical shifting from no action to punch then no reaction. It's almost comical in it's absurdity. Selznick and Hitchcock did not direct so stiffly at that time. So it's not just that it's old.This is one for historians only.,The Maltese Falcon
39,Mr-Fusion,A classic in every sense,8,11 June 2013,"Dashiell Hammett's ""The Maltese Falcon"" was a great book, but it really says something when the movie version is even more enjoyable. Well- written and directed by John Huston, there's a playfulness that comes through not only in the script, but in Humphrey Bogart's performance (who was a terrific pick for Sam Spade, by the way). It's what makes it more than just a top-notch detective story; it's an undeniable classic. Bogie's got the tough-guy act down to a T (hell, he makes it look easy), and Lee Patrick makes for a great scene foil for Bogart (she brings her own moxie to the proceedings). Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet both excel at underhanded characters - Lorre, the slimy weasel and Greenstreet the refined wader of murky waters and smooth in a comical way (that chuckle is hilarious).The dialogue cracks like a whip, giving the ears a workout and making exposition scenes (dare I say it) exciting. ""The Maltese Falcon"" is more than a detective yarn and a film noir hallmark; it's just a consummate piece of classic Hollywood artistry. It's the sort of movie that leaves me hungry for more Bogey.8/10",The Maltese Falcon
40,SimonJack,One of the great detective films and the birth of film noir,10,3 June 2018,"Dashiell Hammett's 1930 novel, ""The Maltese Falcon,"" had been made into a movie twice before. The first time in 1931, it had modest success. The second time, retitled and greatly rewritten except for the characters, it flopped in 1936. But this time, Warner Brothers, decided to do it as Hammett wrote it - with the dark and sinister aspects, and the streetwise and hardboiled detective in Sam Spade. John Huston wrote the screenplay based on Hammett's book. And Huston had his directorial debut with the film. He pioneered the look of film noir on film with his stark shots and scenes. Everything about this production seemed perfect. The casting was the final plumb. Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade is the perfect portrayal of Hammett's character. He has something of a reputation for carousing, but he doesn't let that endanger his sharp eyes and nose. He notices details and when he smells a skunk, he brings it out into the open. Mary Astor has the female lead as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who first comes to Spade as Miss Wonderly. She's the perfect mysterious and questionable femme fatale. Spade doesn't know how far he can trust her. He falls for her, but he's nobody's fool. The supporting cast, too, is superb, and they each set a standard for the roles of the characters they play. Sydney Greenstreet is Kasper Gutman and Peter Lorre is Joel Cairo. Who could imagine anyone else in those roles. Gladys George is very good as Iva Archer, Elisha Cook is believably sinister as Wilmer Cook, and Ward Bond is very good Detective Tom Polhaus. A few dark crime mysteries were made before this, but ""The Maltese Falcon"" was the first to put everything together as clearly film noir. It is widely regarded as the film that established the sub-genre. Many consider this story and film one of the greatest detective stories of all time. Some think it is the best one. A 2006 documentary on ""The Maltese Falcon"" has several sources who comment on Hammett's story and the 1941 movie. Mystery writer Joe Gores, author of the 1975 novel, ""Hammett"", says Hammett ""wrote about what he knew. He was not a writer trying to learn about detectives. He was a detective trying to figure out how to write."" Indeed, Hammett had spent some early years working for the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Baltimore, MD. Eddie Muller, author of ""Dark City: The Lost World of Film Noir,"" said, ""Hammett's big contribution was writing speech the way it was actually spoken. Before Hammett, detective fiction was all very elitist, upper crust. It was game-playing nonsense, you know."" Gores attributed mystery writer Raymond Chandler as saying, ""Hammett took murder out of the drawing room and dumped it in the alley where it belonged.""Author Michael Druxman says that Humphrey Bogart's climb to stardom was boosted more by George Raft than anyone else. Bogart became a star from leads he played in films that Raft turned down. The three biggest such films were ""High Sierra,"" ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and ""Casablanca."" Indeed, since those films were made and well into the 21st century, few could imagine anyone else other than Bogart playing the leads in them. Perhaps that's one reason why Hollywood hasn't tried to remake those films.""The Maltese Falcon"" should delight anyone who enjoys intrigue and mystery. It's essential for any serious film collection.",The Maltese Falcon

Watched today it is fine with some good dialogue but it is slow to start. For current audiences the big entrance of 'knockout' Mary Astor is a real letdown. There is no sign of the lustful lovely and barely a hint of the 'femme fatale' although she does seem to get into the role and is hampered at first with the duplicitous nature of her standing. All is okay and interesting enough to hold the attention and then Peter Lorre enters and the screen lights up. Later it will start to glow when Greenstreet makes his wonderful entry. Bogart who has seemed a bit stiff and awkward with the similarly inhibited Astor is great with the guys, police and all.

I for one don't watch many old classic black and white pictures still this as a watch is interesting having you guess about the characters as no one seems who they really are, and after murders happen you wonder who and why. The film is done in classic detective Noir style though.Detective Sam Spade(Humphrey Bogart who reportedly made his breakout with this role) comes upon a gallery of low life characters who seem connected to one another in one way or the other as it all involves a missing jewel encrusted falcon. As the picture goes it's more apparent nothing is what it seems as clues open up thru old fashioned detective work this is one drama that keeps you guessing.

John Huston does this here with the help of a great Hammett story which he helped adapt for the screen play. He had plenty of help from a great cast including Bogart, Greenstreet & Peter Lorre.This was part of a group of films that Warner did in the early 1940's that put together Bogart et AL. and established him as a super star. It would lead to Casablanca and Sierra Madre and arguably some of the greatest films ever made in this era or perhaps in any era of film history.Sadly, the younger generation might not appreciate these films as much as they age, but the greatest generation has and they get better & better over time. What is amazing is how Warner Brothers happened to assemble a group of films & talent doing them during the late 1930's when they graduated from mob films into classic film noir. Warners & Bogart made this film as much as staple of movies until the 1950's as any company ever did to influence an industry.Mary Astor is the femme fatal in this movie and any woman who played with Bogart always seems to be the right one.

That enormous, in both body and mind, and well read and cultured Kasper Gutman, Sidney Greenstreet. It's there in the British Crown Colony where the Fat Man had a falling out with two of his gang members Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Mary Astor, and her boyfriend Thursby who checked out with the bird to what they thought was the safety of San Francisco.With The Fat Man and his boys sweet smelling Joel Cairo, Peter Lorre, and Wilmer ""Two Gun"" Cook, Elisha Cook Jr, bearing down on her and Thursby Brigid desperately go to SF private dick Sam Sapde, Humphrey Bogart, for help. Using the fake name Mrs. Wonderly Brigid claims that she's in the city looking for her kid sister Croinne who's being abused by her, Brigid's partner in crime, associate Thursby.Spade's partner PI Miles Archer, Jerome Cowan, at first takes the case. Later that evening checking on Thursby in his hotel Archer ends up getting shot and killed by an unknown gunman. It also turns out that Thursby is also murdered leaving Spade in a real tight spot by, besides Brigid, being the only person alive who knows or is about to know about what the connection is between the two murdered men: The Maltese FalconSpade is now in trouble with not only the Fat Man Mob but the police who think that he murdered both Archer and Thursby. Spade's secret affair with Archer's wife Iva, Gladys George, didn't help either giving him a motive to murder his partner. The movie then has Spade being confronted by the Fat Man's two buffoonish hit-men Cairo & Cook, the comical C&C boys. Tough guy Spade has no trouble at all making monkeys of them by alway beating the two doofuses to the punch and taking their pieces, guns, away from them without even breaking a sweat.There's a big break in the case of the missing bird that suddenly comes out to the surface. It's when the captain of the boat La Poloma Capt. Jacobi. John Huston,that brought the Fat Man and his gang to the states from Hong Kong is badly wounded in an assassination attempt after his boat was mysteriously set on fire in San Francisco Harbor. Jacobi escaping with both his life and the black bird makes it to Spades place with it just before he collapses and passes away. Spade putting the bird away with his trusted secretary Effie, Lee Patrick, now has all the marbles that the Fat Man is looking for. He then decides to play hard ball with him knowing full well that he has implicated himself in three murders, his partner Archer Thursby & Capt Jocobi, in doing so.Big and long winded final at Spades apartment with Sam Spade and the Fat Man and his boys and girl, Brigid, trying to figure just whom to set up as the pasty for the three murderers in the Maltese Falcon affair. It's then decided that the wimpy and tough-talking ""Two Gun"" Cook is the lucky guy to pin it on. The big surprise comes later when Effie brings the bird back to her boss Sam Spade and the Fat Man as it in fact turns out to be a fake. The big surprise causes Fat Man Gutman to completely loses it, mumbling unintelligently to himself, as he and both Cairo & Cook check out of the apartment empty handed as they plan to check out of the country as well. It seems that the person whom the Fat Man bought the bird from, a former czarist general named Kemidov, tricked him back in Hong Kong by slipping the Fat Man a phony lead, not golden, bird and then taking off with the real one :The Maltese Falcon! Spade calls the cops who quickly apprehend Fat Man Gutman and his gang. It's then that he confronts Brigid who, unlike the Fat Man and his boys, foolishly stayed behind thus exposing herself as the real mastermind behind this whole squalid affair as well as being the one who blasted away Sapde's partner Archer. Grabbed by the police who raid the apartment a mind-numbed and almost comatose Brigid is lead away to the police station by the officers in the building elevator with Spade instead taking the stairs. It seems that Sam Spade had very deep guilt feelings about his dead partner Miles Archer and the way he betrayed him by having an affair with his old lady Iva behind his back. Feeling in some way that he's as responsible for Archer's murder as much as Brigid was is what I feel lead to Spade's decision in taking the stairs and not the elevator down to the building lobby together with Brigid and the police. This conscious, or subconscious, decision on Spade's part will very well get him in his guilty mind to the same place, the hot spot where the sun don't shine, that Brigid is ultimately headed for but it, in Sam Spades case, would take just a little bit longer for him to get there.",The Maltese Falcon
48,ElMaruecan82,A Pivotal Moment in American Movies' History ...,10,20 July 2011,"In many aspects, ""The Maltese Falcon"" doesn't really help when it comes to convince people uninterested by anything 'old' or in black and white. You might want to prove that this is the film that established Humphrey Bogart's stardom as the new anti-heroic figure of American Cinema, or as everyone knows, paved the way for the noir genre, at a crucial time when people matured enough by World War II could assimilate the cynical and dark undertones that governed the hearts of the characters, in a shadowy black-and-white cinematography. You might as well praise the merits of John Huston's directorial debut and his powerful writing transcended by Bogie's unique nasal delivery. Anyway, say what you want about ""The Maltese Falcon"", its reputation is untouchable, but it's one of these films that need an extremely strong attention and mind-dedication, or in the best case, a second viewing, to appreciate its greatness.It's almost impossible to summarize the plot while discussing or reviewing the film, everything goes so fast, the plot is amazingly intricate, you'd probably be called a genius if you got everything at the end on one viewing, but the movie is not about the plot, it's a movie of style and characters. Take the villains' team, ""The Maltese Falcon"" is supported by a trio of supporting characters as eccentric as unscrupulous: Peter Lorre, the sinister looking but delicate and suave Joel Cairo, Elisha Cook Jr., the constantly bullied character actor as Wilmer Cook, and towering them, there's Sidney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the refined mastermind in a deservedly Oscar-nominated performance. Look at them three, you might never have seen ""The Maltese Falcon"", but you did see these archetypal characters in a cartoon, or a film, the overweight, hypocritically friendly crime boss, the refined effeminate psycho and the young thug, and it's a delight to watch them as everyone has at least one shining moment.The mission of these villains is to get a precious statuette, by any means and at any price, the 'Maltese Falcon', a Golden Falcon ""encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels"" offered by the Maltese Templar Knights to the King of Spain, before being stolen by pirates, and whoever owned the Falcon rarely died of natural causes. Many recurrent 'Hustonian' themes are foreshadowed in this masterful debut : the alienating power of greed to make one sell his soul, a cynical and detached view of life made of murder and deception, the eternal theme of failure highlighted by the realization that the bird is fake, letting all the protagonists in an equal position of losers. But a loser, Sam Spade certainly isn't, as the movie ultimately consecrates the triumph of noble and virile principles over manipulative feelings.This is probably the highlight of the film, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Mary Astor as the deceitful femme-fatale who asked for Spade's protection, revealed herself to be a calculating monster under that gracious mask of femininity, and eventually the murderess of Sam Spade's partner, Archie Miles. Sam didn't like Miles, he hardly blinked an eye when he learned about his death; he apparently had an affair with his wife, which quite doesn't paint a sympathetic portrait of the character, and makes him suspect number one in the police's book; but when Spade realized that Brigid, who played so well the part of the poor victim, inspiring his famous ""You're good. You're very good"" comment, killed his partner, he knew he could never have lived with himself if he covered her. The unforgettable line ""I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck"" is the perfect illustration of Spade's cynical predisposition to accept the fate of a person he genuinely loves, to accept the possibility of never seeing her again, as a man of principles. People were tougher in these times, and needed a model, someone they could identify with on the big screen, the final minute is simply the revelation of a character, of an actor, of a new star.Humphrey Bogart is one of these actors who achieved stardom the hard way, the long way but when he did, he never left it, and after ""The Maltese Falcon"", he never was a second-billed actor. Only for that, Huston's film deserves all the praise. Indeed the 'Falcon' helped to widen the range of characters Bogie could play, he who got his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the ruthless villain in ""The Petrified Forest"" gave such an electrifying performance, he had a short career, being the bad guy that makes the other bad guy look good (James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson) until Huston wrote him another leading bad-guy role for ""High Sierra"". But before becoming Bogart the apathetic and romantic lead that would pair up with the torrid Lauren Bacall, he needed a transition role, Sam Spade, the winning card of a brilliant career, where Bogart became the quintessential tough guy, at a time where male stars had to look like Clark Gable or Tyrone Power. Bogart looked like an ordinary man with an everyday look, but a man with an attitude, a heart, and a character. It's interesting how the statuette and scene stealer Gutman, always mentions what a character Sam Spade is. Spade inspired the respect of his own enemies and that was Bogie, the kind of man, you could love or hate, but never disrespect, before another defining role in ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".I think this characteristic mirrors what I think of ""The Maltese Falcon' you might not like it, finding it too talkative, too slow, too boring, but never deny its greatness and significance in cinema's history. There would be a before and after 'Falcon', at least for Bogart, but we're talking about the greatest American star.

It's an almost word-for-word adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett novel and it was adapted by John Huston who knew he was onto a good thing. Huston had written movies before but had never directed one and this is one of the two or three greatest directorial debuts of all time. It's almost totally dialogue driven yet the camera movements are fluid and economical and then there's that cast, probably one of the two or three best casts ever assembled for one film. (These are among the finest performances any of the players ever gave but with dialogue this good that may have been easy.Sam Spade is still the definitive private-eye, both on screen and on the page and Bogart's performance was the best of his career.

As the deeply duplicitous Brigid O'Shaughnessy, (I haven't lived a good life; I've been bad), Mary Astor gave us the greatest of all screen femme fatales, the definitive role of her career and the one by which all the other women in all the other film-noirs should be judged. Then there is Sydney Greenstreet's 'Fat Man', (By gad, sir, you are a character), Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo, (When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it), Gladys George's black widow, (Be kind to me, Sam), Elisha Cook Jr's gunsel Wilmer, (the cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter) and Gail Patrick's hard-boiled secretary Effie.

And what makes The Maltese Falcon with its ludicrous plot and foamcore characters so untouchable? Three things, in, uh, spades: pace, script, and archetype. All of these make for a stylized film--no gritty realism, no method acting, no penetration. No social commentary. No innovation. Nothing really but a beautiful sprint that leaves you breathless, but not tired. The film is about style, and coolness (not to be mistaken for hipness--cool as in chilled, unflappable). It has aura, and clever detachment. Even the characters are detached. They are pulled by the events but never, except when the fat man gets out his pocket knife at the end, swept away. One by one, these really great actors get to sharpen the edges of their two- dimensional selves, and it's really amazing to watch.This is John Huston's first film, and like that little first film by Orson Welles released just six months earlier, it has a scary mastery to it. But if Huston, like Welles, rode the talents of many studio professionals at their peak, he pulled the film away from cinematic excess into what almost feels almost like a fast, and highly distilled, adaptation of a theater production. (It's based, of course, on the detective novel by Dashiell Hammett.) The movie talks a lot because there isn't much to show--nothing physical really happens beyond a couple of fisticuffs--but such talk! When Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman first meets Bogart's Sam Spade and they share a drink, sit, and light up cigars, Greenstreet (also in his first film) bobs and feints through some fabulous wordplay, ending, with the camera low to make his size only larger: ""I'll tell you right out, I'm a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk.""Bogart says, ""Swell,"" and he talks without giving an inch. He really is ""cool"" in that way Bogart, through most of his movie roles, still defines for us decades later. Huston must have felt the transcendent power of the still rising star (Casablanca was still a year away) because, ultimately, the film is a vehicle for Bogart being Bogart, in the face of three or four counterparts who are each at their archetypal best. And gosh, Bogie sure knows how to take a gun away from hapless bodyguard played by Elisha Cook, Jr.The film is no empty exercise in expertise. It creates a fictional world we can understand top to bottom because it's so simple. We enjoy all the principals so much, we happily tag along on the unfolding trail of this improbable ""black bird"" and its sudden arrival toward the end for the sake of soaking up the characters, as characters. And look how even Bogart at one point looks jittery compared to Greenstreet, whose ponderous ease and guffaws in the face of trauma won him an Oscar nomination. Peter Lorre, plausibly uncertain and almost tender (and who's to say whether homosexual, too, in an wan, period stereotype) in his attempt at badness, is a marvel, someone you talk about later, someone who can parody himself in Capra's 1944 Arsenic and Old Lace (which shares a screenwriter with another Lorre film, Casablanca).Spade's cynicism, his wariness, his occasional up-and-up certitude (he gives the money back!), and his willingness to laugh at it all, above all, overcome weakness like his so-called romance with the Mary Astor femme fatale. The end actually falls a little flat because we don't believe in their love, but we're not sure he did either. And did we ever believe her? In fact, isn't that part of the trick here, not believing anyone, ever?",The Maltese Falcon
53,vincentlynch-moonoi,Exceptional (though flawed) film with brilliant performances,8,2 August 2013,"Although I had watched this movie a couple of times before, when I saw a documentary that talked about, I decided that perhaps I hadn't given it its full due. So I pulled the DVD off the shelf last evening and watched it again...after reading about it on Wikipedia for some background.In terms of plot, I don't think it's any masterpiece, although it is a good story. I would fault the movie somewhat because during the first half hour (of 101 minute film) you may find yourself struggling to grasp what the movie is really about (although, since I had seen it before and read about it, I knew...but I still think the first 30 minutes meanders around quite a bit with no clear destination, although that's not to say it's not intriguing. But then, things begin to fall into place and you have the development of a good mystery. In the end, you may reflect and say: wow! It's amazing how much they packed into 101 minutes! It's interesting how many references to homosexuality there are in this film...and that they got away with some of them. First, Peter Lorre's character is clearly effeminate, both with his behaviors and his gardenia scented calling cards. In an early scene, Bogart says to a male detective of his male partner, ""What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom?"" And later, when Bogart slaps a thug, ""When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it."" But the reason this film is sooooooo good is the acting. Although he had already been in films from 1928 - 1940, 1941 was really the year that Humphrey Bogart came into his own right as a true star, rather than a supporting actor. And it was in this film, in my view, that he showed what would be a fairly common theme throughout the rest of his career -- a good guy who was just a shade away from being a bad guy. As Sam Spade, that persona worked well, and continued to work well for Bogart in any number of pictures. The female lead -- Mary Astor -- is perfect here as a woman who is acting an evolving part in a never-ending comedy of errors; you can see she's not to be trusted, although superficially she seems highbrow, while underneath she's really a con.Gladys George, who surprisingly gets third billing, is rather irrelevant to the story as Bogart's partner's wife. I don't think how good Peter Lorre's role is here as an somewhat effeminate crook; in fact, I would say it's brilliant, and perhaps his best role. Barton MacLane is around as a detective, but his acting is always pretty static. Lee Patrick is enjoyable here as Bogart's secretary.Surprisingly way down at 7th billing is Sydney Greenstreet as ""the fat man""; but this was his first film...and he turned it into a gem of a role with his evil giggling; interesting to watch his early scenes here where he is filmed sitting and you see him at an odd angle from the belly up.I've always thought that Ward Bond was an underrated actor. Here as a police detective he gets better screen time. Jerome Cowan, as Bogart's detective partner doesn't last long...killed off within minutes of the beginning of the film. Of special note here is Elisha Cook, as Wilmer, an effeminate gangster (?) who plays it too tough only to be put down repeatedly by Bogart...a very good role for him. Interestingly, John Hamilton is around as the DA (he later played Perry White in television's ""Superman"" series. And you have to watch carefully for the ship's captain, who turns out to be Walter Huston, director John Huston's father, in an uncredited cameo.The bottom line of this film is the old saying that there is no honor among thieves. But few films have ever portrayed that concept with such verve. Highly recommended...an exceptional (though flawed) film.Walter Huston as Captain Jacobi (uncredited)",The Maltese Falcon

Its mood and characterizations drive the story and create interest.Humphrey Bogart is Sam Spade, a no-nonsense private eye who is hired by a woman (Mary Astor) to find her sister. At least that's where the story begins.Actually the story begins in the daytime, accompanied by upbeat music, but that dummy beginning quickly gives way to the shadowy cynicism that is the hallmark of film noir. It is a world where Sam Spade feels comfortable, making strategic moves in a game with ever-changing rules.Two other actors grace this film with their classic portrayals: Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, and Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo. This is character acting at its best. They are perfect foils for the twitchy pragmatism of Spade, for whom monetary reward may or may not be his highest motive.",The Maltese Falcon

While many film noirs have convoluted plots, here it's so much so that the characters spend the whole film trying to explain who is doing what to whom. As Sam Spade, Bogart is as cool as they come. Astor, Greenstreet, Lorre, Bond, and Cook round out the terrific cast. It is an impressive directorial debut for Huston. However, it's too talky and unnecessarily convoluted to be regarded as a great film.",The Maltese Falcon
58,The-Sarkologist,A Classic Movie that Deserves the Position,9,15 September 2013,"This is one of the most famous movies ever made. Based on a book the movie was first made in 1931 and later remade in 1941 with Humphrey Bogart playing the detective Sam Spade. Most critics, including Bill Collins, directs us to focus on the characters in the movie because it is the characterization that makes this such a great movie. I agree to a point, but I think the whole issue of the Maltese Falcon makes this such a dark movie.The book upon which this movie is based is considered to be a change in direction with the way detective stories are made. Edgar Allen Poe was the creator of the detective story and it was developed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but their detectives were intelligent, honourable men. Sam Spade could be seen as one of the first ""Down and Out detectives."" The author of The Maltese Falcons describes private detectives as police officers who do not like to work with people but rather go it alone. These characters are more crooked and ruthless than police officers. It is no wonder that the police in The Maltese Falcon are somewhat cold towards Sam Spade. Spade works with fellow Detective Miles Archer and the movie opens with a young lady, O'Shannahey, hiring Spade and Archer to trail some guy who has stolen her sister from her. Suddenly Archer is shot and the movie starts into motion.The Maltese Falcon was a statuette that was stolen by pirates as it was being delivered to the King of Spain and it has supposedly surfaced in San-Fransisco. The movie is not a search for the falcon but rather people all wanting a piece of it. The fat man, who is the villain of the movie, wants the falcon and pays Spade a lot of money to get it. He doesn't want to part with his money and has his gunsel Wilma to dispose of Captain Jacobi and get the falcon.The harsh parts of the characters are revealed with the Fat Man willing to sell out Wilma, whom he claims to consider a son, to get the Falcon off of Sam Spade. And then there is O'Shannahey, a beautiful young lady who grabs Spade's heart, yet we know that Spade does not truly love this woman as we learn that he is having an affair with Archer's wife. O'Shannahey is not what we expect. At first she comes as an innocent woman who is looking for her sister but we find a web of lies and deceit surrounding her and the more we get entangled in the lies the more sinister O'Shannahey becomes.Spade is not a hero either, rather he is an anti-hero. He his selfish and cold, ready to betray his partner for a woman, and ready to betray his lover for his reputation. He slaps around Wilma and Cairo, treating them like little children. Spade is an arrogant, self-centered person and would rather look after himself than others.I think the ending of the Maltese Falcon is brilliant. I am one who looks more at the ending of a movie than the content because it is the ending that we are left with when we leave. The ending of the Maltese Falcon is not happy, nor is it sad. Rather we are just left knowing that life will go on.",The Maltese Falcon
59,redryan64,"Long Overdue, Ryan !",10,1 July 2018,"WELL NOW, HERE'S one for the books ! It seems that some particular, optherwise very conscientious writer really stepped on it ! The scribe in question (me), has failed to write his impressions of this John Huston production of THE MALTESE FALCON (Warner Brothers, 1941). IN ONE SENSE, this would be an easy error to commit; being that it is one of those ""essentials"", as they are called on Turner Classic Movies. We've truly screened it probably about 5 score times (that's a hundred, Schultz!). This celluloid mortal sin is compounded by the fact that our association with IMDb.com dates back to 2001. OH WELL, PLEASE accept our sincere Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpas ! Now let's move on and rectify the situation.WHAT MORE COULD be said about this Classic ? It ranks right up there with such Bogart standards as CASABLANCA, THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, DEAD END and HIGH SIERRA. once this movie hit the theatres, there was a new standard set for the Detective Story.MUCH LIKE SO many Warner Brothers production of the period, this FALCON wastes little screen time. The story telling is taut, but not at all lacking. Director and co-screen writer, Mr John Huston, worked very well with the film editing department, possibly doing his job just a little too well. The editor most likely had a lot less to do than was the norm.AS FOR THE selection of the actors and actresses who would bring it all to life on the silver screen, everyone pitched in and worked as a sort of rep-oratory company. In addition To costars Bogie and Mary Astor, we had Peter Lorre (newcomer to Warners), Gladys George, Barton MacLane, Lee Patrick, Ward Bond, Jerome Cowan,Elisha Cook, Jr.,James Burke, Murray Alper and John Hamilton. These were all folks who were regulars around Warner Brothers, contract players. The cast also contained a couple of others, who could only be called ""Gems"" and inspired bits of genius. FIRST OF ALL, we had an unbilled, uncredited appearance by a veteran as Captain Jacoby, skipper of the ill fated steamship, La Paloma. It was Walter Huston, veteran and Father of writer-director John Huston. (This is an appearance that many otherwise astute film buffs remain unaware of.THE CROWNING GLORY and ultimate find was the casting of 63 year old Sydney Greenstreet in hi first film. Adding to his outstanding talent, tyhe production team made the fully figured Mr. Greenstreet appear even heavier and more portly. This was accomplished by specially tailoring his costuming and with the use of low angle camera shots done by the cinematographers.THE STUDIO HAD considered casting Edward Arnold in the role; but Studio Head Honcho, Mr. Jack Warner, saw Mr. Greenstreet in a stage play in the Los Angeles area and the rest is history. IN PARTING OF this most unusual and long overdue review, let us just say from the bottom of our hearts, ""THANKS, JACK !""",The Maltese Falcon

In this quest everybody wants to find this statuette because it is very precious and they will earn plenty of money from this.I liked this movie because it has very nice plot and many twists on it and this is something that makes this movie really good and interesting. I also liked this movie because of the direction which made by John Huston but also fro the interpretations of the cast. It has to be mentioned the great interpretation for one more time of Humphrey Bogart who played as the detective Samuel Spade and Mary Astor's who played as Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Another one interpretation that I really liked was the interpretation of Sydney Greenstreet who played as Kasper Gutman and in my opinion he was really good at it.Finally I have to say that ""The Maltese Falcon"" is an interesting movie to watch and the thing that makes it so interesting and unique is the really well written plot. This movie wants to show us that you can spend plenty of the time of your life searching for something and in the end it will not matter the result.

He delivers rapid-fire dialogue with a clipped precision and doles out punishment when necessary with two-fisted explosiveness. There's not a bad performance in the film, but my favorite (next to Bogart) has to be Peter Lorre as the sweet-scented Joel Cairo (an unusual performance, to say the least, for a film from this period). He takes it on the chin from pretty much everybody in the movie (the mere mention of Gutman causes him to go limp with fright), but forges ahead.

63,johnnyboyz,"Passingly interesting premise stretched out into somewhat something of a slog with its now basic, generic codes and conventions seeing it etched into the history books.",6,27 September 2009,"I'm not sure I 'get' The Maltese Falcon; a film lauded with so much praise and given so much in the way of attention over the years that it has embedded itself within cinematic history as one of the greats of the classical Hollywood era. Hollywood's star system may have died a death as the face of American cinema slowly shifted onto different levels, but it seems people just cannot get enough of this one hundred minute Humphrey Bogart vehicle that allows people to hark back to a time when set-shot, scuzzy, black and white film noirs were the mainstay for the cinematic crowd out for that genre; and people could see their acting heroes do what ever one-dimensional, 'tough guy' act it was that they did.A pet-dislike with The Maltese Falcon, although others will say it's all part of its genius, that I have is its low-key and minute look at a period in each of its character's lives. The film's item that springboards everyone into action is a small falcon statue, made by the Maltese for the Spanish in the 1500s, worth millions of dollars and is rumoured to be floating around the San Fransisco area circa 1941 when the film was set and produced. The tracking of the statue and the long history it carries is immense, rich and actually quite interesting; and yet The Maltese Falcon as a stand-alone film is only a brief glance into the lives of a handful of people; all of them squabbling with one another as they struggle with the finding of it. The film is an exercise in narrative; it revels in its labyrinth of a plot that doesn't really hold weight for its runtime. After an hour, we are ready for it to end; I failed to immerse myself in the lives of these people; I failed to connect with any of the predicaments and most of the film is a mundane, ponderous and somewhat daft passage of searching, talking, friendships, double crosses and make-ups.The film actually begins with a murder; a murder of a certain individual who is linked to the chief protagonist Sam Spade (Bogart) in the sense they were partners together in a private investigation firm. I always approach a film that has, in what is practically its first scene, a murder of someone, with a degree of trepidation. When a film begins as abruptly as this, it can use that killing on the thirty second or so mark as a reason to deconstruct why it was the perpetrator did what he or she did, as well as document the downfall of the victim in equal measure – did they deserve it?; What did they do wrong?; Who were they? There's a wonderful moment in 1990's Goodfellas when the film catches up on itself following its opening scene which is a brutal stabbing and shooting of another gangster. We are thrust into the forefront by way of the director's shock tactics, and maybe we don't like it all that much. What follows is a documenting of one of the abettors and a scene much later on in which it becomes obvious who the victim was and why he had that happen to him.The Maltese Falcon carries none of that heart. The film is, in truth, a really soulless exercise; a film that has someone killed in what is a tragic waste of human life, and then just jogs on with everything else it wants to deal with in a casual and uninteresting fashion. Is the statue around? Who will end up with it? Who killed that guy we had zero affinity with in the opening? The film shoots along at a rapid old pace and yet is sophomoric in its story telling. It's a complete waste of everyone's time; characters and audience alike – but hey, we get to see Bogart spit some one-liners and escape to the world of 'noir' for a hundred minutes; so who cares, right? There is that consistent ideology amongst critics, theorists and audiences alike linked to genre cinema, or 'genre film-making'; the ideation that if a certain number of boxes are ticked within certain genres, it garners a passing grade. The Maltese Falcon may well be one of the best genre pieces ever produced, what with its manipulation of light; its use of shadows; the desirable blonde who perhaps isn't all she seems; the downtrodden detective; the hard-minded cops that observe the lead tread between what's criminal and what's legal as well as the gruff voice-overs. In this regard, The Maltese Falcon is total noir; it is a less-than fascinating example of style over a substantial development of its two-bit characters and utter bore of a narrative. Perhaps it did set a trend for how noir was to be explored on screen; in that case, The Maltese Falcon is the filmic equivalent of an essay on the conventions of noir, as penned by John Huston - nothing more.It's not that I hate The Maltese Falcon, it's that I find it frustratingly turgid and inconsistent; characters will flick from liking one another to being one another's enemies, at one point a character even refers to Bogart as 'one of the wildest, most unpredictable persons I've ever known' in what comes across as a kind of self-aware line detailing the sporadic and inconsistent allegiances. Given the fondness I have for both the film and neo noir genres, not particularly taking to this might be the equivalent of a horror fanatic evoking a lukewarm reaction to Hitchcock's Psycho. The endless chasing and nattering on of this statue so steeped in history wears out its welcome as Bogart attempts to crack why his partner was killed so early on. It means 'who?' and 'why?' accompany, but do not compliment, 'where?' the falcon is. As an exercise in genre and laying out the ground rules, the film is somewhat appealing but it doesn't deliver for me.",The Maltese Falcon
64,filipemanuelneto,This falcon is still a classic today.,7,9 August 2020,"This is probably one of the most compelling classics in noir movies. It is a style that even today has passionate and faithful followers, and sometimes reappears in cinema, whether in the form of simple tributes or even in the form of a kind of ""neo noir"" that we can see in films like ""Shutter Island"", ""The Black Dahlia"" or ""Mulholland Drive"".The story of this film revolves around a statuette of a falcon, made of gold and precious stones, an ancient artifact that an order of knights - which the film clarifies at the outset to be ""the Knights Templar of Malta"" (I will talk about this later) - offers in the 16th century to Emperor Charles V in exchange for the Mediterranean island of Malta. According to the story of this film, the object was lost and never reaches the hands of the emperor. In this film its the search for the artifact that motivates a crime that is investigated by a detective, alongside the police.The biggest problem I had with this film lies in the historical premises on which the script was built. It may seem petty, but I am a historian and I value a certain historical rigour. That is why the expression ""Knights Templar of Malta"" gives me chills of horror as it mixes and confuses two orders of cavalry that should not be confused. One is the Order of the Temple, or the Knights Templar, which has nothing to do with this film, and the other is the Order of the Hospital, or Order of Malta. The Knights Templar were founded after the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099, at the end of the First Crusade. The order became very rich, acquired land, prestige and power, aroused envy. Persecuted by the French king Philip IV, it was extinguished by Pope Clement V in 1312. The Order of the Knights of St. John, or Knights Hospitallers, was also founded after the conquest of Jerusalem and also enriched but was never extinct and still exists today, with another name: Sovereign and Military Order of Malta. This is due to the fact that, when Jerusalem was lost by the Christians, the knights moved their headquarters to Cyprus, then to the island of Rhodes until, finally, they settled on Malta in 1518. The island, then part of the territories of the Crown of Aragon, was ruled by the Germanic emperor Charles V, who was also the king of Castile, Leon and Aragon (today Spain), as Charles I. Calling Templars to the Hospitallers Knights is, thus, a gross history error, almost like saying that Lincoln founded the United States of America, or that Napoleon I was the last king of France.The film is dominated by the presence of Humphrey Bogart. A great actor from the golden age, he is excellent and I just found it difficult to keep up with him when he accelerated his speech and ran over words, making it difficult to understand what he was saying. I also liked the performance of Gladys George and Mary Astor, which surprises us in the end with an interesting but somewhat obvious twist. In turn, the character of Peter Lorre struck me as a bit of a caricature. The film has a lot of dialogue and it can be a bit boring, especially for those who expect a little action, but I handled it well except for Bogart, as I said.Technically, its a discreet but very competent film, with quality production values. It has excellent cinematography, with impeccable and original shooting angles and camera work. Its relatively high contrast looks good on the screen and makes the film visually pleasing. The light and shadow effects and lighting are truly superb. The sets are routine but elegant, the costumes are excellent with all the raincoats and fedora hats we could wish for. Of course, cigarettes and alcohol couldn't be missing, and I don't see any problem with that.",The Maltese Falcon

67,l_rawjalaurence,Memorable Performative Evocation of the Film Noir World of 1940s San Francisco,8,17 October 2014,"Structurally speaking, John Huston's film is rooted very much in the quota-quickie tradition. It is mostly shot in the studio, with some stock footage at the beginning of San Francisco; and the action zips by at a cracking pace in a series of sequences shot mostly in close- ups and two-shots, with the occasional zoom in on the characters' faces to signal some dramatic moment. Lighting effects are straightforward yet meaningful, such as the mirror-image of the sign outside Sam Spade's (Humphrey Bogart's) reflected on one of the interior walls, making us aware of the cramped environment in which the private detective operates.On the other hand, THE MALTESE FALCON remains a classic of its kind, due in so small part to the quality of John Huston's script and the memorable individual performances. As Spade, Bogart comes across as a tough, no-nonsense personality; but at the same time blessed with a sense of humor. After having lost his temper with Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), we see him leaving Gutman's apartment and grinning to himself as he makes for the elevator. What we've just seen is a deliberate performance from Spade, designed to intimidate Gutman in spite of Gutman's bulk. On other occasions Spade registers his increasing strain with a grimace; after he wakes up from being drugged by Gutman, and kicked in the head by Gutman's sidekick Wilmer (Elisha Cook jnr.), he grimaces twice and totters towards the washstand, in an attempt to recover his sang-froid. The fact that he manages to do so is evidence of his tough, uncompromising nature. Bogart's characterization contrasts with that of Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy - an actress par excellence, she possesses the ability to turn on vulnerability at will in order to persuade men to 'protect' her. The fact that she doesn't need protection explains why she is so dangerous; no one, it seems, can get to the bottom of her character, not even Spade. When, at the end of the film, she declares her love for the detective, we cannot quite believe her; and therefore we sympathize with Spade's eventual course of action.Peter Lorre turns in a memorable cameo as Joel Cairo - a fastidious, bespoke-suited person with white gloves and an elegant top hat. He seems the kind of person who should be capable of avoiding conflict, yet he keeps encountering it with unerring regularity, and coming off second best. His first confrontation with Space is especially memorable, as he holds up the detective with a shotgun, yet finds himself rapidly frisked of his possessions. Lorre's diminutive figure contrasts with that of the gargantuan Greenstreet as the master-criminal in search of the eponymous falcon. He manages to keep his cool even during the most stressful situations - aware, perhaps, that he holds most of the financial and muscular aces.The plot is a complicated one, but really does not matter in a film that is nothing less than a feast of great acting, with the entire cast at their best.",The Maltese Falcon
68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Embodies so naturally so much of what the noir genre is,8,15 July 2012,"When you're going back and watching classic films, sometimes you happen upon something that encapsulates its style or genre so essentially that you mistake it for being unoriginal. That's how I felt initially about ""The Maltese Falcon,"" but it's far from unoriginal, especially when you consider the amount of talent it brought to the big screen in John Huston, Sydney Greenstreet and Humphrey Bogart.Of course the genre to which we're speaking in this case is film noir, evident enough by the amount of smoking in the film and the main character being a private investigator, though surprisingly there's no narration. Plus, it's driven by mystery and deception.Bogart stars as Sam Spade, whose P.I. firm of Spade and Archer gets a shakeup when a women identifying herself as Ms. Wonderly (Mary Astor) comes to their office and asks that they tail a Mr. Thursby, who she says ran off with her sister. Archer takes the job, though the woman's innocence looks like a sure rouse.Well, turns out indeed that none of that was true, as that evening both Archer and Thursby are found dead. Spade knows of the connection, and it puts him in a way with the police. He needs answers from Wonderly, who turns out to be named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, but he also needs money. He agrees to put up with her lies so long as he gets paid and gets a lead so that he can stay a step ahead of the police.Spade isn't crooked, but he's no saint of a main character. He's driven by the same things as the many supporting characters that become wrapped in this mystery and he's just as self- serving and manipulative. Spade sticks to his guns, which involves never getting in so deep that he can't keep his head above it all.Because Bogart practically created the mold for the noir protagonist, he deserves all the credit in the world as Spade. He owns every scene in the film (granted the camera only leaves his side once at the very beginning) and Only Peter Lorre, one of the greatest character actors of all time, can go toe-to-toe with Bogart as Joel Cairo, one of the men after the titular statuette. Astor has her moments in the film as her character's shell starts to finally crack at the end, but Bogart is the man here.Mystery drives the ""The Maltese Falcon"" more than suspense. The closer to the end the more the suspense takes over, but in the early going we are left without a clue as to what's going on; all we can tell is that everyone, especially Brigid, is probably lying. Spade has to work really hard to get a modicum of truth out of anyone, and only a person of his awareness has what it takes to sort through it all.The film is forthright in its deception and wastes no time trying to convince you of anything one particular thing being the truth. It makes it hard to care much at the beginning, but as all the players come into the picture with Brigid, Cairo, Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jr.) and Kasper Gutman (Greenstreet) it's easier to get a bit more invested in the outcome.As a first time director, Huston excels down the stretch in his debut and also at ratcheting up our interest after one of the film's many long dialogue-heavy scenes usually by giving us a mysterious or suspenseful image to carry our interest into the next scene or creating a major tone shift. It's not quite to a Hitchcockian degree, but it has a similar effect.When it's not long-winded ""The Maltese Falcon"" works. It engages its audience and keeps things interesting until the end with some performances that simply have come to define Hollywood's most classic genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

70,funkyfry,Slightly flawed classic,8,24 October 2002,"Houston's first film as director is a solid noir/detective film.  Great bits by Lorre, Cook Jr., and Greenstreet solidified their careers in the field. Bogart plays Sam Spade to the hilt, investing him with realism and at the same time giving him almost mythic stature.  There are some good twists but unfortunately we don't care about any of the characters -- Astor in particular plays almost a charicature more than a character.  Still, this film set up a good type for others to follow, and set Bogart on the course of his greatest stardom.",The Maltese Falcon
71,imseeg,"What's all the fuss about? No suspense, no drama, no romance, no originality. Just an average detective, beautifully photographed, but lacking in punch.",4,22 January 2019,"What was all the fuss about? This was supposed to be THE Humphrey Bogart classic? Get out a here. John Huston by all means is a great director who made marvellous classics, but this movie is just bland and going through the motions. Lacking in any sort of punch from beginning to the end.And I mean really lacking in punch, because I had to restrain myself from skipping certain parts that kept dragging on.The bad side: this movie has written FORMULA all over it. It was one out of dozen others. And one can sense that cheap formula format fairly easy when watching it, because there is no attention for detail. No true to life acting. No time or effort taken to make it special. The studio wanted to make this movie very quickly and director John Huston had every single line of dialogue prefabricated to speed production time up and save costs for the producers.On the good side: photography is beautifully done though. Many scenes are like portraits. Lighted in such a way that it could be a still photograph. Humphrey Bogart looks great when he doesnt move, but he acts a bit as a stiff puppet, although his acting isnt as catatonic as the supporting actors who look even more stiff and bland, churning out their lines as if it were a grocery list.What was all the fuss about this being an amazing classic? Get out a here. Only suited for movie geeks, but not for the casual viewer. Watch ""Cassablanca"" instead, because THAT is a TRUE classic, which still stands strong today and whjch has a story, that the casual viewer could really enjoy to this very day. ""The Maltese Falcon"" though is just a bland formula run of the mill movie, incredibly overhyped by senior movie geeks, who are only interested in the historic value of this movie.",The Maltese Falcon

This is the quintessential Bogart performance, hammered home by a similar performance in Casablanca. This is how we all (the baby-boomers) remember Bogey, and THIS is the Bogey we love.

73,freemantle_uk,The start of Film Noir,9,20 May 2010,"Film Noir is easily recognised as one of the best genres and periods in Hollywood history, offer audiences darker tales with faulted characters and often had a femme fatale love interest. This is a genre that has given us some real classics like Sunset Boulevard, Kiss Me Deadly and Touch of Evil. This is a genre that later influenced great films like Blade Runner and Sin City. The Maltese Falcon is recognised as the film that started this genre.Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) was a skilled private detective in San Francisco and a client, Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor) asked him to find her sister. Spade accepts the case but his partner is killed it becomes clear that there is more to this case then meets the eye.Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) also offers Spade $5,000 to help him find The Maltese Falcon, a small black statue of particular value. Cairo had been betrayed by Wonderley and Spade quickly becomes entangled in this complex case.As well as being the first major film noir, The Maltese Falcon was the first film from John Huston, the director of The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen and The Man Who Would be King. This was also the film that made Bogart into a star. So The Maltese Falcon is an important film from a historical scene.Huston shows great skill as a director, having a dark tone, a strong tone, effective lighting to add to the mood of the film and uses few settings to effectively tell the story. Huston shows Spade's is a resourceful, clever and only uses violence when he has to do. The final took place in one room, showing Huston's skill with it's simplicity.Spade is a excellent example of a faulted hero. He is a womaniser and his primary concern is money: but these faults makes Spade into a more believable character and Bogart was excellent choice for the part. Lorre too was a good choice as the generic foreign villain (or at least on of them), showing he was a top performer. Elisha Cook, Jr. was also an actor of note in the role as Wilmer, a henchman for the main villain of the film.A skilfully made film and start of a great genre.",The Maltese Falcon
74,PWNYCNY,Good movie but not as intense as the book.,9,13 February 2014,"This is a very good movie but it is at best a watered-down version of the book. This movie does not even come close to capturing the cynicism that permeates throughout the book. Also, Humphrey Bogart is miscast as Sam Spade. In the book, Spade is six-feet tall, is muscular and has blond hair. He crosses the line separating the client from the detective so many times that it is clear that he has joined the gang that he ostensibly had been hired to investigate. He literally becomes one of the thieves, and they are thieves and murderers. Furthermore, Spade obstructs the police who are trying to investigate the case which is involves multiple murders, is not above shaking down people and beating people up and ultimately violates the rights of his client by gaining her confidence and then using the information derived to turn her in to the police, this after he had slept with, stripped her and humiliated her. True, the lady is a murderer, but with extenuating circumstances. Further, Spade is cold-hearted and brutal. He is not above have an affair with his partner's wife and when she comes by for support, brushes her off, this while she is in mourning no less. Now, the question is: why would anyone want to write a such a story? Of course, the answer to that question is purely speculative, but from judging from the nature of the story, the author has a cynical view of American society and questions the honesty and integrity of those institutions that are supposed to protect society. The depiction of the police as being little more than nuisances is a case in point. Two police detectives are investigating a double-homicide, which is serious business, and Spade is refusing to cooperate in the investigation, which, of course, raises suspicions as to his culpability in the crimes. There us nothing about Sam Spade that is heroic, genuine or worthy of emulation. He listens to lies for money and when he learns that the thieves are chasing down something that may be worth a lot of money, he joins the chase, abusing his client's right to confidentiality to extract information, not to help his client but to help himself. The movie depicts Spade in a different light. Here his is cynical but not as overtly brutal. He is not shown sleeping with the woman nor of stripping her naked. He is also shown as having a certain code of conduct which he follows while in the book the code of conduct is discarded in favor of crass expediency. Mary Astor is wonderful in the movie, but she too is miscast. The young lady, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, is a whore who is running with a rough crowd and then steals something from a group of thieves, from which the story evolves. She came to Spade for protection and Spade took her money, thus becoming her employee, and confederate. Now, the question of love between Spade and Brigid comes up in the story. Spade repeatedly evades that question, yet his actions speak louder than words, thus showing that he cannot be honest with himself. His actions show that he cares for her: he has the key to her apartment, he sleeps with her, he kisses her, her caresses her, and intercedes on her behalf when another man, Cairo, attempts to molest her. She has no shame with him. In short, she loves Spade, and in return, Spade informs on her because he doesn't want to become one of her saps, which he had already become the money he took her money. Now, does this mean the movie should not be watched. Of course not, it is a classic and is entertaining. But don't expect to find it as intense as the book, because it is not.",The Maltese Falcon
75,ackstasis,"""I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble""",9,24 February 2009,"Nobody can be trusted. In the fast-talking, winner-take-all world of private investigation, you must always have eyes at the back of your head, otherwise, you'll wind up with bullets in your back. The overweight, conversational ""Fat Man"" (Sidney Greenstreet) has a few nasty tricks up his sleeve; the harmless-looking Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is determined to complete the task at hand; the frustrated hired hoodlum Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) knows how to hold a grudge; the deceptive femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) speaks naught but lies. This is the seedy world of private dick Sam Spade (the one-and-only Humphrey Bogart), a man who is used to being in control, always cocky in the face of danger, and never afraid to do what it takes to unravel a case. 'The Maltese Falcon' was the second great debut of 1941 (after Orson Welles' effort, of course), and even today remains a gripping and unpredictable thriller, with a perfect cast, intelligent dialogue and a twisted, winding storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end.Just last night, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep (1946).' The screening was my second viewing for both films, and Hawks' film seemed to receive a stronger audience response. Though both pictures undoubtedly emerge from the same storytelling mould, borne from the hard-boiled fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, respectively, there are marked differences to be found in where each director places storytelling emphasis. Whereas 'The Big Sleep' wades determinedly through swathes of seedy characters, many faceless and unseen, John Huston is considerably more concise with regard to his characters and plot. Sam Spade's investigation revolves almost entirely around five central roles, close-knit acquaintances who are continually stabbing one another in the back. This degree of intimacy works well with the story, ensuring that each character has a well-developed personality and back-story to justify their behaviour through the film, however frequently they utilise lies and deception.'The Maltese Falcon' is often cited as the first true film noir, which isn't entirely accurate. 'Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)' and 'High Sierra (1941)' more closely exhibit the sensibilities of the style, whereas Huston's film is strongly indebted to the pulp crime films of the 1930s, such as 'The Thin Man (1934)' {not coincidentally a Dashiell Hammett creation} and its sequels. Indeed, 'The Maltese Falcon' was in fact the third adaptation of Hammett's 1930 detective novel of the same, but it is generally considered to be the best of the three. What the film did contribute, however, is Mary Astor as the archetypal femme fatale, a lying dame whose rottenness is evident from the beginning, but whose charms are such that men are putty in her hands. The notion of a strong, independent heroine had grown in popularity throughout the thirties, and here it was turned against the usual male oppressor. In the film's cruel but justified ending, Spade acknowledges being influenced by O'Shaughnessy's allure, but ultimately reasserts his dominance by condemning her to prison despite his possible love for her.",The Maltese Falcon
76,robfollower,One of the quintessential much watch 'Film Noirs'.,10,27 February 2019,"One of the quintessential much watch 'Film Noirs'. Into the offices of the Spade & Archer detective agency sweeps a Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor), who offers a large retainer to Sam and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) if they'll protect her from someone named Floyd Thursby. The detectives believe neither Miss Wonderly nor her story, but they believe her money. Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case -- and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby. Miss Wonderly's real name turns out to be Brigid O'Shaughnessey, and, as the story continues, Sam is also introduced to the effeminate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and the fat, erudite Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his film debut). It turns out that Brigid, Cairo and Gutman are all international scoundrels, all involved in the search for a foot-high, jewel-encrusted statuette in the shape of a falcon.This is one of the best examples of actionful and suspenseful melodramatic story telling in cinematic form. There's two competing frames of reference throughout: the narrative itself, then a meta-narrative with the characters continually voicing the etiquette of their genre scenario .

So says Private Eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) to his professional client and would-be lover Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) after the ill-advised ""confession"" he's verbally abused out of her in regard to the death of his partner, Miles Archer (portrayed by Jerome Cowan, whose widow Iva, played by Gladys George, is his past and current bed mate, making Sam the #1 suspect in Archer's death!). This love quadrangle is completed by the fact that just before dying, Miles--no doubt sensing that partner Sam was dallying with his spouse--has pledged to get Sam back by boinking Brigid before serial womanizer Sam can have his way with this new girl drawn into the misogynistic orbit of Spade & Archer, Inc. FORGET ABOUT THE BLACK BIRD. This 1941 version of the Dashiell Hammett novel THE MALTESE FALCON proves serial-killer-by-proxy Sam one of the most lethal murderers ever to run rampant with no weapon except his forked tongue! Sam obviously set Miles up for murder, directly leading to Thursby's killing, if not Capt. Jacobi's. With three or four more of Sam's clients and business associates set up by their turncoat money collector (who takes the concept of professional-client privilege 180 degrees in the wrong direction) for a neck tie party on the California gallows as this tale ends, the only question is whether his secretary Effie Perine (Lee Patrick) is Sam's co-conspirator and sadistic true love.",The Maltese Falcon

Their mutual attraction is undeniable... But Spade will play the fool for no woman He is a loner, but he has contacts, and knows where to go for what he wants Even with very little money, he is totally incorruptible He has no apparent friends He is laconic, but he can throw a wisecrack as fast as he can throw a punch...""The Maltese Falcon"" molded the image we remember of Bogart all through the early years of the Fortiesan image elaborated upon and reinforced in ""Casablanca,"" and the one which all Bogart fans remember with great affection and admiration",The Maltese Falcon
80,snoozejonc,When I think of film noir I think of The Maltese Falcon,10,3 December 2020,"Private detective Sam Spade gets drawn into a number of shady dealings after the death of his partner.The Maltese Falcon was the first noir style movie I ever watched and I remember being captivated by the genre ever since. As a young boy I thought it would be cool to be like Sam Spade in the early 1940s, having to unravel a complex mystery, deal with amorous femme fatales, dodge nosy police lieutenants, slap trench-coated hoodlums about, and all whilst being waited on hand and foot by a glamorous secretary.The period, setting and lifestyle mentioned above is brought to life by John Huston using an intriguing plot, atmospheric cinematography and distinct characters spewing out rapid fire dialogue.Essentially the plot unfolds in a handful of long conversations between Spade and various others. It is intricate and laced with murder, deception and lots of single-minded, self-serving shenanigans. The movie's themes are never laid out explicitly, but they are embodied by the characters in their behaviour.The dialogue and its delivery by all performers is brilliant, particularly by Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet. Nobody plays this type of lead role quite like Bogart. He is ice cold as Sam Spade and many of his memorable and quotable lines showcase the type of antihero protagonist that feature in many of the noir films released after. Greenstreet matches Bogart in the lightening paced banter whilst Peter Lorre, Mary Astor, Barton MacLane, Ward Bond, Lee Patrick and Elisha Cook Jr all provide excellent support. When looking back at older movies you see countless examples of wooden, unnatural acting, but this movie contains none of it. Huston assembled a cast with no weakness.It has wonderfully atmospheric cinematography, making exceptionally good use of lighting and shadow. We have highly contrasting black and white footage taken at variety of angles that make the best use of the space for the actors to perform. When a movie consists mostly of actors talking to each other, it has to be shot exceptionally well to keep things interesting.The themes went over my head the first time round. How things change when you watch this movie through more matured eyes. When you have experienced the world a bit more, particularly its self-serving, backstabbing and greed. Some people will do anything to realise their dreams and then they discover the stuff that dreams are actually made of.",The Maltese Falcon
81,MissSimonetta,Deserving of its iconic status,10,17 May 2017,"John Huston's adaptation of The Maltese is one of the earliest and best films noir. It may not have the prominent chiaroscuro or stylistic flourishes of later noir movies, but it is a gripping story told well, almost perfectly cast (I still cannot decide how I feel about Mary Astor's matronly though calculating femme fatale). The camera is almost always set at a subtle low angle, making the scenes take on a menacing feel, as though anything could happen and no one is to be trusted. Bogart is perfect in one of the two roles that made him an enduring Hollywood demigod, the patron saint of cinematic masculine toughness.Despite the 1940s setting, TMF's themes of greed and human failing remain relevant. Except for the most superficial details, I would say the film has hardly dated at all and remains the definitive cinematic telling of the classic detective novel.",The Maltese Falcon

He is approached by 3 individuals to help find it - Mary Astor (Miss O'Shaughnessy), Peter Lorre (Mr Cairo) and Sydney Greenstreet (Mr Gutman). These three individuals will stop at nothing to get it and there are also 3 murders that need explaining by the end of the film. Sam needs to piece together what has been happening.The cast are good in this film - except the very annoying pipsqueak that is Elisha Cook Jr, who is usually badly cast as a ""heavy"". What a joke! Well, he's cast as a ""heavy"" again in this film although they have given him what sounds like a suitably girlie name - ""Wilmer"". Everyone else does well with my favourite being Peter Lorre who provides some memorably humorous sequences, eg, his first appearance when he is so doggedly determined to search Bogart's office. Lorre also has an unpredictable edge to his character that is genuinely funny, eg, his declaration that he is tired and wants to go home at an opportunistic occasion and his non-greeting to Bogart one morning in a hotel. His dialogue delivery is inspirational at these moments. However, the dialogue, in general, was spoken quite quickly - it seemed like everyone was using too many words. In fact, you can't afford to let your mind wander at any point or you will lose the plot. A mention must also go to Lee Patrick who plays the secretary ""Effie"". She was very good in her role and deserved a bit of romancing.The story is good and Bogart is a bit of a ladies' man in this film which is odd coz he's got a weird mouth.

I liked the characters and actors so much that I really ""wanted"" to get involved in the story. But everything was strewn all over the place and confused me enough that I was prevented from fully getting into the movie. There have been some films that seemed incomprehensible to me at times, but as long as most of their loose ends become tied up by the time the end credits begin to roll, I'm usually a happy moviegoer.

85,Enchorde,The lost bird...,7,27 January 2007,"Recap: Sam Spade is a private detective in San Francisco when a ordinary case that dropped in his lap suddenly evolves into a great and dangerous mystery. A beautiful woman under a false name says she wants a man followed in hope to rescue her lost sister. But that tail leads to Spade's partner getting shot dead, the woman's story quickly falls apart as more and more people turns up taking an interest in the case. Spade must keep his nose above the water in order to survive, and maybe make a profit out of it.Comments: A delicately put mystery, with twists and turns coming as quick and hidden as they can be. Which is both the main strength and weakness of the movie. You must keep alert to follow, which is good, the situation changes constantly. And the camera follows Spade, and takes his view as the story unravels. Which is good and neatly done. But this also leads to the state of me, as a viewer, being confused, and expecting being confused. You never really invest anything into the present situation, knowing that it will switch soon enough, so you never really get surprised when that switch comes. And that is the weakness. A great mystery with a twist must fool the viewer to believe the present, but at the same time subtlety plant a foreshadowing of the twist. So when the twist comes, and the situation changes, you'll be surprised, but when thinking/looking it over you can discover the leads and find the logic. In the Maltese Falcon you never really care to look for many leads, as you know them to be false... However, the mystery is entertaining to follow, but it is limited to just that, follow, a passive viewer. You can't participate to solve it...The actors give good performances. Bogart is there almost always and never misses a cue. His rambling speeches with some little quirks neatly inserted, as when he is at the DA's office, are great. But the best performance is the Fat man, although he can be a little too much sometimes. Haha - not that he is big - but he repeats himself a little too much sometimes.So, I felt it was a good mystery, but didn't quite live up to being #57 on the top list.7/10",The Maltese Falcon

87,Steffi_P,"""If you lose a son, it's possible to get another. There's only one Maltese Falcon""",9,27 June 2007,"Film noir was a boon to Humphrey Bogart. Essentially he could play the same roles as the cold, low down types he made supporting roles of in the 30s, but now these characters were in lead roles. Here he in his defining role, in a key film noir and debut of director John Huston.Film critics rarely agree on what was the first film noir. There are arguments for there being noirs before it, and there are arguments for it not being a true noir at all, but the Maltese Falcon is a convenient candidate for the primal film noir in the way that it seems constructed to announce itself and smash conventions. Conscience and cosiness are thrown out right from the start  in scene one we are introduced to the cheerful and innocent Miles Archer; in scene two he is shot dead. As the plot bowls along there is nothing but greed, deception and double-dealing. When Spade does the decent thing it is only because, in his own words, ""you're supposed to"". Even the long dead crusaders aren't exempt from accusations. And, one of the least often cited film noir conventions, the women are the untrustworthiest of all.Also appropriate for the Maltese Falcon's status as a key early noir is the history of the novel it's based on. Cinema has always been some way behind literature in terms of what it can say and get away with, and Dashiell Hammett's novel had already been filmed twice, once as a heavily sanitised thriller and then again as a comedy, of all things. By the time Huston came along, cinema was acquiring a brutal honesty and his version is far closer to the original story than the previous two adaptations.Whatever its noir credentials, the Maltese Falcon also works as a great piece of entertainment. It's incredibly fast moving, with absolutely no excess baggage to the script. It is constantly engaging, which is strange since it is virtually all talking, with very little action. The answer to this is that the story is full of enough revelations and plot twists to keep the audience constantly engrossed. By the final scene  a half-hour long tour-de-force  your heart will be racing. The only downside to this spellbinding mystery structure is that the film will never be as exciting as the first time you see it.As for Huston, it's well known that he began his Hollywood career as a screenwriter. What's not so often acknowledged is that he was also a keen painter, and always considered this more important than his film career. His painterly influence isn't entirely obvious in the Maltese Falcon, it's not a pretty film as such  although there is one very eye-catching shot of the burning Paloma  but you can see he pays great attention to the set up of a shot. He has a real awareness of background and foreground, as well a knack for getting the perfect angle. He makes the already plump Sidney Greenstreet look like a small mountain.If following a director's themes and obsessions is your thing, the Maltese Falcon also provides a perfect example of Huston's cynicism for material goods (as embodied by the falcon itself) and his continual focus on failed quests and unachievable ends.The Maltese Falcon was bound to be considered a landmark film, marking as it does the debut of one of the greatest American directors of his era, the transition of a well-known character actor into Hollywood's top leading men, and in retrospect the beginnings of a whole genre. Aside from it's historical importance, it also happens to be one of Huston's best, one of Bogart's best, and one of film noir's best.",The Maltese Falcon
88,ShootingShark,Our Private Conversations Have Not Been Such That I Am Anxious To Continue Them,7,26 April 2015,"Sam Spade and Miles Archer run a private detective agency in San Francisco, and are hired by a Miss Wonderly to find her sister, who has eloped with a man named Thursby. That night both Miles and Thursby are shot in separate incidents, Wonderly disappears and Sam is the police's chief suspect for both murders. Who killed them, and why ?Like only a handful of other movies, it's hard to overestimate The Maltese Falcon's huge influence on the crime genre in specific and cinema in general. Of course there are films which preceded it about private eyes, slippery femme fatales, shifty suspects and twisting plot lines. It's not even the original screen adaptation of Dashiel Hammett's classic 1930 novel (Roy Del Ruth first filmed it in 1931, and it was remade again in 1936 as Satan Met A Lady). This version however combines an astonishingly assured performance by Bogart with an outstanding supporting cast, a brilliant head-scratching script by Huston and superb direction to create perhaps the definitive crime picture, and paved the way for many memorable film noir and gangster classics to follow. It's also important to note the small scale of the film - Bogart and Huston were well respected as a supporting actor and writer respectively, but it was Huston's debut as a director (arguably one of the best ever) and it made Bogart a huge star and cemented his reputation as a hard-boiled tough guy. The screenplay is very faithful to Hammett's riveting book, with only minimal abridging for such a deliciously deceiving story, and as with all the best crime fiction it's really all about the people, and what drives their darker personas. Bogart plays a fabulous thin line between good guy, world-weary cynic and dangerous bluffer as he plays off everyone out to chisel him, on both sides of the law. He is aided by one of the most memorable support casts I've ever come across; Astor is sensational as the serial liar/lover who's constructed so many false identities she's not sure of anything anymore, Lorre is superb as the dapper Levantine Mr Joel Cairo, all perfumed accessories and aloof mannerisms, Greenstreet is unforgettable as the corpulently wily Kasper Gutman (""By Gad sir, you are a character.""), and arguably best of all is Cook as the psychotic gunsel Wilmer, who seems constantly poised to explode but instead suffers every indignity at the hands of Spade. The players bring Hammett's rich and strange characters to vivid life with such craft and intensity it's almost impossible to imagine anybody else portraying them. The rumpled detective has become such a staple of books and movies it's easy to forget its origins, but Bogart here will always be the definitive private eye. Crisply photographed by Arthur Edeson (who also shot Frankenstein and Casablanca), this is an unmissable forties classic and one of Huston's best movies. It's also a truly amazing book you must read, although in my view two of Hammett's other novels, Red Harvest and The Glass Key, are equally sensational. Trivia - the one-shot-no-lines-die-on-the-sofa scene-stealing character of Captain Jacoby is played by the great Walter Huston, the director's father.",The Maltese Falcon

It is one of those classic films that most people know of but never get to watch. But yeah, AMC had it on and gave me a chance to watch it. It was okay. Classic noir film. It isn't the best noir I have ever seen but it is okay. The acting is frankly lacking, from pretty much everyone except Humphrey Bogart. So yeah, the film with such an iconic title and etc is a bit disappointing. It may just be a little too dated which shouldn't make much of a difference if the film was a better experience with a cleaner flowing story, better acting, set design and etc, etc. Ultimately the movie is a letdown. 6.5 out of 10.",The Maltese Falcon
90,onepotato2,Pretty Funny,7,28 May 2007,"When I saw this as a teen about 20 years ago, I was really surprised and disappointed by the ending. I never thought much of it after. I expected that objects appearing in, and talked about in movies to carry it's meaning. But with a couple decades educated in real-world cynicism, sexual politics, and movies themselves I appreciate it more. Also knowing that the storyline is a all just a ruse, frees a viewer up to enjoy the trip. If you're confused, forget the bird, everyone is working to get their claws on a totem that signifies loot. 'Murder my Sweet' is more convoluted than this.Watching Mary Astor transform from a phony modest lady to someone who kicks Peter Lorie and loses her shoe (over just 40 minutes), is pretty funny. Spade's quick mind that can transform actual scenario A into phony scenario B is fun to watch. Bogart calling Astor out is great stuff. He has some hysterical lines notable for their harsh cynicism. Bogart is an amoral guy with crummy values, predating the anti-hero but in the end he decides on a moral but painful selling out of Astor. It's pretty startling.Greenstreet has a habit of repeating phrases and sentences to an annoying degree (""My, but you are a character!"" - 7x, ""...as if you were my own son."" - 2x)",The Maltese Falcon
91,Movie-ManDan,The First Brain-Popping Flick!,10,23 December 2014,"There are movies that require more than one watch to fully enjoy or understand. The Matrix and Inception are two great examples of this. I still know some people that have seen Inception many times and still don't fully get it. 1941's Maltese Flacon was (from what I know) the first movie to ever do this. A seemingly regular murder leads to another which leads to a quest for a little statue of a bird. How that happens requires many watches. What I like about these kinds of thrillers and mysteries is that I feel really good about myself and smart whenever I finally figure out everything that's happening.I may have mentioned The Matrix and Inception earlier, but The Maltese Falcon is less comparable to those two and more to The Usual Suspects and LA Confidential. The Matrix and Inception are sci-fi/action movies that are much better pieces of film, using techniques and special effects that no movies at the time had strength to do. The Usual Suspects and LA Confidential, on the other hand, have just crazy scripts that really screw with your mind. It took me about four watches before fully understanding The Usual Suspects. I'm about half-way getting LA Confidential and almost fully getting The Maltese Flacon.The general premise is detective Sam Spade's (Bogart) partner and a criminal are murdered after being set up by a woman (Astor). More murders and quirky characters are yet to come as the whole thing revolves around a statue of a bird. This is all I can say without giving too much away. Bogart delivers his best role as the film's first cool cop. I honestly find him better than Rick Blaine in Casablanca. What makes this so complex is all of the confusing points are explained so quickly in a weird order. That is clever, as it makes the viewer want to see it again and again. Bogart is such a cool character and the noir feel is awesome, so it is one to see several times even if it was easy to follow.4/4",The Maltese Falcon
92,winner55,the hero as a better shark,10,4 September 2007,"when John Huston took on the challenge of bringing ""The Maltese Falcon"" to the screen, he recognized a problem with Hammett's novel that previous screen adaptations had missed entirely.Hammett's Spade is an inveterate liar. Whatever his ethical commitment to his job, his partner, the law, in fulfillment of these commitments he just about never tells the truth.If audiences - of the book as well of this film - miss this, it is because the sea in which Spade swims is filled with sharks - thieves, killers, adulteresses, corrupt police and politicians. In such an environment, its probably best to keep one's teeth sharp and one's senses sharper. One can only accomplish something remotely heroic if one has first become a better shark.Does Huston manage to get this point across? Not entirely; it's really a difficult point to make in film, and the films that do make it strongly tend to be pure crime sagas, like ""Public Enemy"" or ""The Godfather"".Nonetheless, Huston certainly keeps us guessing on essential points, right to the end - and beyond. Does Spade really love O'Shaughnessy? If he could have gotten away with the real Falcon, would he have kept his bargain with Gutman? And now what's he going to do with his partner's wife, who was just a casual fling after all? There's no doubt that Huston directs the finale to be as final as can be - but the seriousness of such questions gives the film a weight it can't unload.Finally, it should be noted that Huston's gambit here would never have worked without exquisite performances from an ensemble cast.Improves on multiple viewings - give it a chance, it's worth it.",The Maltese Falcon
93,tomsview,Jewel encrusted,10,22 November 2016,"Whenever I see this film I am always impressed with how good the story is.These days we are used to brilliant crime/mystery series and movies on TV and cable, but back in its day ""The Maltese Falcon"" was head and shoulders over just about every film in the genre, which often had unbelievable stories and lightweight characters.It not only had that great story, but crackling dialogue and a perfect cast. From Bogart as Sam Spade, Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy to Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet as Joel Cairo and Kaspar Gutman, the cast almost seemed divinely inspired.When I finally read the book, I discovered that the great story and that crackling dialogue is in there: ""When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it"", ""I distrust a man who says when"", and all the others, they were author Dashiell Hammett's all along.But what director John Huston and the cast did was to bring the characters to life; they gave them shadings beyond Hammett's words. The film added to the book. That isn't always the case. How often has the indefinable magic in a book failed to come through in the film? But in this case the film added the magic.Although Hammett came up with the plot and just about every word we hear spoken, it's hard not to picture Bogart as Sam Spade even when Hammett describes him as a blonde Satan.No, something unique happened on that film, it was Huston's first directing job and he just laid out the pages, edited them a bit, and shot the whole thing pretty much in sequence - and he sharpened the ending.In his impressively researched ""The Lost One: A Life of Peter Lorre"", author Stephen D. Youngkin tells how Lorre regarded this as the most enjoyable filmmaking experience of his career. Huston created a family atmosphere among the cast and crew. That wasn't necessarily the atmosphere Huston always created - Ray Bradbury on ""Moby Dick"" probably didn't think so - but this was his first film as director and there was no shortage of enthusiasm.Although the film is nearly 80-years old, the story and the characters are so strong you soon forget that there isn't a smartphone or computer in sight. I love Bogart's tough, cynical Sam Spade, he's seen it all, but he is not without empathy.In fact it's those characteristics that are the secret to all the truly successful PI's and cops in movies and on TV ever since.",The Maltese Falcon

Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy (Barton MacLane), who inform him that Thursby was also murdered the same evening.

95,DeeNine-2,Classic gumshoe tale with a great cast,10,21 February 2002,"This was John Huston's first film and some say his best. It features a most interesting cast led by Humphrey Bogart who, one can see, had a great time playing the devil-may-care and cynical private eye, Sam Spade, a creation of mystery novelist Dashiell Hammett, who also created another cinematic favorite, The Thin Man (1934) (and sequels) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Playing opposite Bogey as the tearful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy is Mary Astor, at the time in her mid-thirties and a veteran of many films going back to the silent era. Interestingly enough one of the films was The Runaway Bride (1930). In Hollywood the films never change, they just get make-overs.Peter Lorre plays the perfumed and villainous Joel Cairo in a style both humorous and sinister. His distinctive high pitched voice has become a staple of cartoon villains. Sidney Greenstreet, the rotund one, who catches up on his reading while they await the delivery of the falcon, plays Kasper Gutman, art connoisseur and sly crook. Elisha Cook Jr., the eternal little man with a gun, whose face seldom changes expression from that of hurtful vengeance, plays Wilmer Cook, Gutman's bodyguard.What makes this film the favorite of so many is the supremely confident manner in which Sam Spade deals with not only the motley assortment of crooks and con artists, but with the police, tearful women and the district attorney. He's a man's man whose rationality and good old fashioned common sense allow him to spot deception in the twinkling of an eye and give him the power to turn his back on love if there are strings attached. The cosmopolitan air and the sophisticated script allow the players full scope and they are fascinating to watch. Astor's fake tears and feigned innocence cause both Bogey and the audience to grin broadly. And the tête-a-têtes among all the characters, but especially between Greenstreet and Bogart and Lorre and Bogart--the big eyes, the greedy grabbing of guns--are the kind of scenes you can watch again and again with pleasure.Some see greed as the theme of this film, and indeed John Huston is very good at delineating the psychology of greed--witness also his The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)--but in the existential character of Sam Spade we see an American legend come to life. He is the thinking man of action living life by his wits and an independent code, the kind of man who takes life as it comes but without ever losing his sense of humor, the kind of guy we'd all like to be.There are a couple of earlier version of this film, The Maltese Falcon (1931) with Bebe Daniels and Ricado Cortez, and one starring Bette Davis and Warren William called Satan Met a Lady (1936), neither of which I've seen, but I understand that the 1931 version is very good. With help from a script by Truman Capote, Huston made a kind of a spoof in Beat the Devil (1954).Incidentally, in this and in The Big Sleep (1946), Bogart never really plays the gumshoe with the kind of hard-nosed disregard for conventional morality as envisioned in the novels, but is politically-corrected for the mass movie audience. Note here however that the first thing Sam Spade does when he gets the guys unconscious is to go through their wallets.Bottom line: a classic and a treat. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Maltese Falcon
96,sme_no_densetsu,Classic film noir with an iconic performance from Humphrey Bogart,8,1 July 2011,"For John Huston's directorial debut he chose to adapt Dashiell Hammett's hard-boiled mystery novel ""The Maltese Falcon"", which had already been adapted twice before (with little success). The result was a highly influential film that is today revered as a classic of American cinema.The story revolves around private eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) of Spade & Archer detective agency. When Archer is bumped off while trailing a suspect Spade takes over the case and becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding the titular bird.One of the film's strengths is the Oscar-nominated script by John Huston. It's been a while since I read the novel so I can't recall precisely how faithful it is but it bears all of the marks of quality craftsmanship in any case.Of course, the script wouldn't seem as impressive without some quality acting talent to bring it to life. Humphrey Bogart delivers one of the best loved performances of his career while Mary Astor shines in the female lead. However, in my opinion the film's best performance comes from the Oscar-nominated Sydney Greenstreet (in his first film role, no less). Then there's also Peter Lorre, who contributes a colourful performance in support.Huston's direction seems to show a bit of inexperience but that's a minor point. Most of the time, his direction, the cinematography of Arthur Edeson & the Adolph Deutsch score combine to produce a trend-setting style. Some have referred to the film as the first major work in the film noir genre.In the end, while I appreciate ""The Maltese Falcon"" I think that it pales just a bit in comparison to 1942's ""Casablanca"", which reunited a few of the stars. However, since ""Casablanca"" is practically flawless there are few films that wouldn't suffer from comparison. In any case, ""The Maltese Falcon"" is a sterling example of film noir, justifiably well remembered after all these years.",The Maltese Falcon
97,seymourblack-1,A Statuette To Die For,8,1 August 2009,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is the unforgettable, groundbreaking crime drama which is regarded by many as the first film noir of the classic period. Its significance in Hollywood history is enormous as it provided John Huston with his directorial debut and Humphrey Bogart with the role which made him into a major star. Huston's screenplay famously remained very faithful to the style of dialogue used in Dashiell Hammett's book and in so doing provided some wonderfully economic and incisive lines, particularly for Bogart's character.Bogart's role also had a broader significance because as Sam Spade, he brought to the screen a new type of hard boiled detective who was destined to become the template for a whole succession of others who would appear in numerous films noirs particularly in the 1940s and 1950s. These men would be morally ambiguous , fast talking tough guys who had a cynical attitude to the world and who lived by their own set of principles.Sam Spade is no one's idea of nice guy. He keeps his emotions armour plated and when his business partner is suddenly murdered shows no concern of any sort. He had also been having an affair with his partner's wife but in his dealings with her, he also seems rather cold and offhand. Despite these characteristics and his obviously jaundiced attitude to life and people, his character is redeemed to some extent by a subtle quality which Bogart's innate charisma brings to the part.In ""The Maltese Falcon"" Spade is hired by a Miss Wonderley (Mary Astor) to find her sister. This job leads to the death of his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) and shortly after, to the murder of the alleged seducer of Miss Wonderley's sister. Miss Wonderley then contacts Spade and tells him that her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy and that the story about her sister had been as false as the name she'd given him and she then pays him to find out who was responsible for the two murders.Spade's subsequent investigations bring him into contact with Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), the ""Fat Man"" Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and his henchman Wilmer (Elisha Cook Jnr.) and it becomes apparent that they are all on a ruthless quest to locate the priceless statuette called ""The Maltese Falcon"". Furthermore, he discovers that O'Shaughnessy's earlier subterfuge had been linked to the fact that she also had been trying to find the ""Falcon"". Spade eventually identifies the murderer and informs the police who go on to arrest the culprit.Brigid O'Shaughnessy had acted naive, timid and vulnerable when she had first encountered Spade but his natural scepticism prevented him from being taken in by her. Joel Cairo was a small, nervy, effeminate man and Wlmer was generally a silent presence during Spade's conversations with the ""Fat Man"". Gutman was sophisticated, good humoured and friendly on the surface but was also extremely dangerous and untrustworthy. He also delivers some amusing and eccentric lines such as when speaking to Spade he says ""Now Sir, we'll talk if you like and I'll tell you right out that I'm a man who likes talking to a man that likes to talk"".Bogart and Huston worked well together and went on to collaborate on other major successes such as ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), ""Key Largo"" (1948) and ""The African Queen"" (1951). ""The Maltese Falcon"" was also a great box office success, was well received by the critics and was also nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Sydney Greenstreet) and Best Adapted Screenplay (John Huston).",The Maltese Falcon
98,Spuzzlightyear,The type of film that gets better with every viewing (and this is my first time watching it!),8,19 July 2006,"'The Maltese Falcon' is a dynamite whodunit, one of the best in the business, as it takes tremendous risks, even in the first 15 minutes, by giving a landslide of plot information, and leaving us, the audience to try to absorb it all while this mystery is going on,. Let's see, Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a private detective who takes on a female client who complains that someone is following her. Sam's partner in the firm, Archer, takes on the case. Unfortunately for Archer and the person he is following, both of them are killed. Archer's widow comes to Spade's office, and Spade and Archer's Wife make out like there's no tomorrow. The police get suspicious of Spade, mainly because he didn't really come to examine Archer's body at the crime scene, and the fact they have suspicions about Spade and Archer's wife, whether Spade iced Archer for her. Now, I haven't even HARDLY given you the main plot yet, as a matter of fact, all of this happens in the first 10 minutes! And the Maltese Falcon isn뭪 even introduced yet! Nor is the Fat Man!

99,bobsgrock,Maybe the finest of its kind.,9,8 March 2009,"John Huston's directing debut, Sydney Greenstreet's acting debut, and Humphrey Bogart's break-through role all come together at the right time in this third and finally right adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel. Bogart is smooth and cool as Sam Spade, a witty and smart private detective who stumbles across a plot to nab a priceless falcon thanks to a woman with a mysterious motive (Mary Astor), a man with seemingly limitless resources (Greenstreet) and his bumbling sidekick (Peter Lorre).What makes this film so interesting is that there is hardly any action at all. There is only one seen shooting scene in the first ten minutes and after that it is simply following Spade around until he uncovers all he needs to. This shows Bogart's ability to carry a film, Huston's writing ability as well as his direction that perfectly enhances the plot and always keeps moving forward. Despite the lack of action, the story is never boring and the end result more than satisfying. If you like any kind of mystery, this is a must-see. It's also a classic film showing the beginning of a new Hollywood genre, film noir, that practically changed the path of the industry.",The Maltese Falcon
100,film-critic,The Maltese Falcon is made out of PEOPLE ... PEOPLE ...,6,23 July 2008,"It is a caper of sorts, a classic ""who-done-it"" which forces the audience to listen for clues and make their own judgment upon a vast array of cinematic icons. There is the first time introduction to the cultish detective Sam Spade, an early view of Chiklis' Vic Makey from ""The Shield"". There is the dame, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who is the quintessential wild-card of the group, holding nothing but betting all, she sparks where there should be a flame. Peter Lorre's classic Joel Cairo leaves plenty for parody for the next several decades, while Sidney Greenstreet plays the cliché British crime lord willing to believe he is the smartest in the bunch. So we have a beginning  Huston inventing a formula that will be copies, used, abused, and overplayed throughout Hollywood for the rest of days  so  why doesn't this original feel original? With our players in place, Hammett's voice spoken with ease, and Huston behind the wheel  this should have felt like a country drive with tension building at the right parts, the take arriving sooner than expected, and Spade proving himself the victor unconditionally. Yet, this wasn't the track ""The Maltese Falcon"" took. Instead, we begin with a jumbled jigsaw puzzle of facts, relics, and the unknown that makes you feel that you have 5000 pieces and only an hour to complete. Huston begins our story with grace, giving us early indication of our characters and brute honesty that seemed unexplored for the time, but just as we believe we understand the overall plot, he throws in more, on top of more, on top of more to thicken the plot, when in fact he is fully pulling us away from the illustrious ""Falcon"". This movie is about a bird. It is a rare statuette that promises wealth and power to whoever holds it. It is this bird that scatters our characters all over the place, but ultimately takes them nowhere. Without giving any overbearing plot points away, Spade early on looses his partner uncaringly. Spade, a womanizer with his partner's wife, seems to care less about the death and is literally scraping his name away from the window the next day. I understood Spade to be a loner, a troubled detective whose brains foiled his heart, but this seemed a bit too cold for a character that we were to care about. Huston gives us nothing with Spade  any history that is begun is immediately dropped as a new plot devise is introduced. Bogart lisps his way through the performance, proving that he is just as cold as the criminals, but never quite connects with the audience. Huston will not give us the bird, so instead he detracts our focus away from the statue to Spade, which again, doesn't have enough to build on.My point is that our characters give us nothing. They may be enjoyable to view on screen, but they are as bland and thin as the paper I write this on. Over the years, they have been unjustly transformed into iconic characters, but I needed to know more about Spade  what made him tick and a bit more detail on his slight idiosyncrasies. While I may have enjoyed watching Lorre's portrayal of Cairo, his usefulness became obsolete by the end. These characters were there, but why? This is a question the inexperienced Huston forgot to include, but Hammett does in detail throughout his book. This is a talking caper, one that doesn't use fancy car chases or large shoot-outs to make their connections, but instead it uses words to guide our characters from A to B. With this said, the words were in place to tell a great story  but Huston could not get his characters to give varied emotions to give us characters. How could ""The Thin Man"" successfully do this, and entertainingly make me laugh, while as the time moved I cared less and less about this falcon that was supposed to carry this film? Huston just seemed to be missing a big element that should have connected our characters to this bird  we needed something to keep our motives in motion.Finally, without giving anything dynamic away, the ending was pitiful and unexciting. Finally, we have exactly what we need, the chess pieces are ready to be victorious, but then nothing happens. Huston builds tension, but provides no conclusion. Instead of being an ""Indiana Jones"" our heroines become sputterer's of life lessons. One doesn't need a lesson, we need a conclusion. The final image of the bird in the light sent shivers down my spine because of the time devoted to this slap-happy mystery. There was no mystery, only a warning about greed.Overall, I must credit this film for being an original. Sam Spade's likeness has been used in nearly every detective film both symbolically and overtly. But, just because an icon rests here  it doesn't mean that the film itself is worthy of praise. Hammett's words were not voiced properly in this film, and the dedication towards nothing was outstanding. This was a film about a statue of a bird, but instead we spend more time talking about it than actually finding the bird. Our characters are paper thin, and by the end we care nothing for whomever ends up with it  either good or bad. It was as if Huston had taken all the pieces of a puzzle, bunched them together, randomly hammered them together, and then provided us with a sloppy finished product. I wanted to like this film  it is a dark classic that is honestly overplayed  but I cared nothing for what was happening. Thirty minutes in I was bored. What would Spade think of that? The verbose ending ruined my image of Spade  how about you? Grade: *** out of *****",The Maltese Falcon
101,telegonus,The Other Big One From 1941,10,27 September 2002,"1941 was a phenomenal year for films. The number of great ones is too long to list here. Two of the most beloved movies from this remarkable year are Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon. On the surface, they couldn't be more different, and yet there are at times amazing similarities and contrasts that makes them worth discussing together. For one thing both were the directorial debuts of men who would each play a dominant role in American movies for the next several decades, Orson Welles and John Huston. Kane was highly touted by its studio, yet created a sensation anyway; while Falcon was made on a modest budget and turned out to be the ""sleeper"" of the year, putting its star, Humphrey Bogart, in the major leagues once and for all. While Kane made its director a celebrity, Falcon did not do the same for Huston, though as the years went by he became as famous as Welles. Kane is flamboyant, adventurous, baroque and outrageous, moving all over the place in space and time. Falcon is small-scale, taking place mostly in cramped rooms, with few exterior shots, on standing sets. The cast of Kane consists mostly of friends and colleagues of Welles' from his radio days, while the cast of Falcon was made up largely of people who scarcely knew each other, though they would become friends later, and in many cases work again on other movies. Both films are mystery stories, but the mystery of Kane is the character of its larger than life protagonist, while the mystery of Falcon is the relatively prosaic matter of who killed Floyd Thursby. Kane is about a man who already has a lot of money, who seeks glory, while the Falcon is about people who could care less about glory but care an awful lot about money. Both films deal with relationships between people who use one another a lot, and neither ends (spoiler here?) happily. The Maltese Falcon was actually the third screen adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's detective novel. It's story is, again, like Kane, hard to follow. What makes it a classic is the way it's done. Everything about this movie is low-key. Voices are seldom raised. The photography is the opposite of flashy. As Sam Spade, the man who is working for three clients simultaneously, and who is out to find the fabled Maltese falcon of the title,--a black enameled figurine of a bird encrusted with jewels--longtime movie bad guy and soon to be superstar Humphrey Bogart gives a straightforward, unmannered performance, Hemingwayesque in its stoicism and sense of style. To put it another way, Bogart never overacts, but he never doesn't act. He's always in character. His work here is brilliant, and one of the reasons for this is that he never appears to be trying. It's one of the classic movie performances of all time, and yet it feels almost ""thrown away"", as if Bogart just walked into the studio, put on his suit, and decided that morning he was going to play a detective. He makes acting look easy.In support, Mary Astor is every bit Bogart's equal, and steals a couple of scenes from him with her chic cafe society manner, like a cross between Katherine Hepburn and Margaret Dumont. Peter Lorre, as an oily effete foreign gentleman, is at times hilarious, and is especially good in his hysterical outbursts. Elephantine Sydney Greenstreet's sleek international crook, with his line of pseudo-scholarly chitchat, is sublime, and almost (but not quite) steals the movie from his co-stars. I especially like the way this treacherous bon vivant goes out of his way to impress detective Spade, as if the two of them were giants among the pygmies. It's small touches like these make the film memorable as much as anything. Then there's intense little Elisha Cook, Jr. as Greenstreet's hit man, trying so hard to be cool. He's like a Spade wannabe, but he's too small and nervous to pull it off, and Spade exposes him for the phoney he is.Indeed, Spade is, of the main characters, the only real deal among them. The rest are not only criminal but unreal. They're an amusing lot, fascinating, even charming at times, but they're all false faces. What trips them up is that their phoniness makes it impossible for them to recognize the truth in others, and this is Spade's trump card. He may not know what's going on, but he knows what's true. The others have at times a better sense of what's really happening, but they don't know themselves, as each character gets tangled up in his own little web of lies and deceit. Spade exploits all this, often cruelly, and in the end gets to the bottom of things. An existential detective film? In a way it is. Citizen Kane's a bit like this, too, but here it's Kane himself who weaves the web, the others who stand by and try to figure things out.",The Maltese Falcon

One of the greats and because it is....",The Maltese Falcon
103,hall895,A noir classic,8,20 May 2011,"The Maltese Falcon, the film which for many defines noir. The film which many would argue invented noir. If this was indeed the first film noir the genre could hardly have gotten off to a better start. Powered by a thoroughly captivating performance from Humphrey Bogart the film is an undoubted triumph. And if it could be said to have invented noir it also in a way invented Bogart. This was the film which began his rise from background studio player to Hollywood legend. But for as memorable as Bogart is in the film he is by no means alone in his brilliance here. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and a delightfully fiendish Sydney Greenstreet are all outstanding as well, each a worthy foil for Bogart. Great acting combined with a great, mysterious story. That's a clear recipe for success.The story unfolds in San Francisco with Bogart playing private investigator Sam Spade. He and his partner, Miles Archer, take on a seemingly simple case. A woman, Ruth Wonderly, hires them to tail a man named Floyd Thursby. Something to do with retrieving Ruth's wayward sister who is traveling with Thursby. Simple. Then Archer and Thursby turn up dead. Less simple. Now Sam Spade's got a mess on his hands. He's got a dead partner. And he's got the police sniffing around thinking he killed Thursby to avenge that dead partner. He's going to need to go to Ruth Wonderly and have her make some sense out of all of this. Which would be much easier if Ruth Wonderly actually existed.When Sam tracks down Ruth she comes clean. Her real name is Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The story about her missing sister was a bunch of hogwash. The real story? Well, we're not going to get the real story just yet. Even when Brigid ""comes clean"" she seems to have quite a problem in forcing the truth out of her mouth. She's still hiding something. What is this all about? Well ultimately of course it is about the Maltese Falcon. The black bird. What is the Maltese Falcon? That will be revealed in time. For now all we, and Sam Spade, really need to know is that people are willing to kill for it.It's a story of twists and turns, of lies and double-crosses. And undoubted danger. Menacing figures will enter the fray. The Fat Man, for instance. Real name Kasper Gutman. Downright terrifying he would be if not for the fact that, as played by Greenstreet, he comes across as a rather jovial fellow. Greenstreet created a terrific character here, one with great, quirky personality. A fiend, but a charming fiend. A man for whom obtaining the Maltese Falcon is his life's quest. His partner in crime is Joel Cairo, as played by Lorre. Cairo's no menace, he knows the value of the Falcon and wants it desperately but if he has to resort to violence to get it he's got problems. Violence is not his forte. When violence is called for that's what the Fat Man's got Wilmer for. Elisha Cook Jr. plays this part, the henchman who would love nothing more than to empty a few slugs into Sam Spade. Overshadowed by the bigger stars Cook does very well with this smaller role. All the supporting players do well, there's not a false step anywhere. But of course the movie belongs to Sam Spade. To Bogart.Bogart's performance in this film is legendary, and rightly so. Everything swirls around him. It's a great story, full of great drama and mystery, punctuated by wonderfully memorable dialogue. If the story has any flaw at all it would probably be that Sam Spade falls for Brigid O'Shaughnessy much too quickly, especially considering what she's gotten him caught up in. Everything unfolds so quickly he really has no time to know her, much less love her. But if Sam and Brigid have real feelings for each other that will make the climax much more powerful and dramatic. So even if this whirlwind would-be romance strains credulity a bit we'll just go with it. With the way Bogart and Astor play off one another so beautifully it's hard to really complain. With this film it is very hard to complain about anything. The Maltese Falcon. The stuff that dreams are made of.",The Maltese Falcon
104,gftbiloxi,The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of--On DVD,10,19 April 2005,"Seldom has any novel been so successfully interpreted on screen: in approaching Dashiell Hammett's seminal private-eye novel, director John Huston not only stayed meticulously true to the plot, he also lifted great chunks on the novel's dialogue directly into the script--and then styled the pace, cinematography, and performances to reflect Hammett's stripped-for-action tone. And the result, to borrow a phrase from the film, is ""the stuff that dreams are made of."" THE MALTESE FALCON is a iconographic landmark in twentieth century cinema.The story is well known. Private eyes Sam Spade and Miles Archer are employed by an attractive but decidedly questionable Brigid O'Shaughnessy to track down a man named Thursby--but within hours of taking the case both Miles Archer and Thursby are shot dead, and Spade finds himself embroiled in a search for a legendary lost treasure: the figure of a falcon, encrusted with jewels.The cast is remarkable. Humphrey Bogart made a name for himself first on the stage and then in films with a series of memorable gangster roles, and was fresh from his great success in HIGH SIERRA; Sam Spade, which offered a new twist on his already established persona, was an inspired bit of casting. Mary Astor had been a great star in silent film, but the late twenties and early thirties found her dogged by scandal; perhaps deliberately playing on those memories, she brought a remarkable mixture of toughness, tarnish, and absolute believability to the role of the very, very dangerous Brigid. And the chemistry between Bogart and Astor is a remarkable thing, a simmering sexuality that more glossy casting could have never achieved.The supporting cast is equally fine. Although a great star in Europe and the star of a number of 1930s films, Peter Lorre was still something of an unknown quantity in American film; Sidney Greenstreet was a minor stage actor with no screen experience; Elisha Cook was a well-liked but neglected character actor. But THE MALTESE FALCON would fix all three firmly in the public mind, and to some extent all three would continue to play variations of their FALCON roles for the rest of their lives.FALCON is particularly noted as one of several films that craftily circumvented the notorious ""Production Code"" by effectively implying but never directly stating the various sexual relations between the characters. Spade has clearly had an affair with Archer's wife, Iva; Archer is clearly a man on the sexual make, and leaps at the chance to tail Brigid. Lorre's lines effectively expose Brigid as man-hungry, and the script and situations do everything but flatly state that Lorre's character is homosexual. Perhaps most startling is the implied sexual relationship between Sidney Greenstreet and the hoodlum Elisha Cook, and the concluding implication that Lorre may well replace Cook in Greenstreet's affections. Just as the plot lines swirl and twist, so do the layers of innuendo and the tangles of sexual uncertainty--all of it adding to the film's feel of uneasy decadence and grittiness.The DVD bonuses are enjoyable but slight--two film trailers and a documentary that uses trailers to show how Warner Bros. marketed Bogart during the 1930s and 1940s. But even if it came without any bonuses the DVD would still be greatly welcomed: although it has not been restored in a computer-corrected sense, this is the finest print I have ever seen of the film, far superior to anything available on VHS. A great film, a true essential, and strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Maltese Falcon

107,gab-14712,Is The Maltese Falcon the First Film Noir?,9,13 March 2021,"John Huston's The Maltese Falcon is a masterpiece. This film is essentially a series of brilliant conversations interrupted by some violent interludes. You think for a second, 'Uh oh, a talkative film...how boring!"" Be prepared to change your way of thinking because its anything but. The flow and apt characterization are just some of the many things that hold this masterpiece together. The cast, starting with the fantastic Humphrey Bogart and brilliant Mary Astor, are exceptional. On the technical side of things, cinematographer Arthur Edeson and composer Adolph Deutsch prove how skilled they are with their respective crafts. The story itself is not the most original (as it is basically about trying to obtain a precious and rare object), but the three-dimensional characters, the excellent direction, and the editing/camerawork/score elevate that story into one of the best mystery thrillers of all time.
Some film historians call this film the very first film-noir. While this kind of story has been told in films and books prior such as the film's novel, authored by Dashiell Hammett, it is this film that inspired other films of the genre; the use of shadows/lighting, the tough-as-nails lead character, and strong female characters. What a spectacular directorial debut for John Huston! The legend behind The Treasure of Sierra Madre and The African Queen made himself noticed! For a first-time director, the man was confident. He methodically planned out his feature shot-by-shot, so it could be completed professionally, on time, and under budget. The film only had a price tag of $400,000. The actors appreciated the extra notes on the screenplay because it meant less interference from the director.
This is the film that gave Humphrey Bogart his due. His turn as the hard-boiled Sam Spade opened the eyes of Hollywood. He was a very good character actor in a supporting sense but never got his big break...until Huston came along. He wasn't even the first choice in the eyes of producer Hal B Wallis, but Huston pushed for him when first choice George Ranft turned the role down because of director inexperience...which wouldn't be his first time. Bogart and Huston became great buddies and working partners and Bogart began an unbelievable run of roles starting with this and Casablanca. But yes, his performance was nothing short of excellent. His character is a private investigator and not a nice one, which is part of what makes up the film-noir genre.
As I just mentioned, Sam Spade (Bogart) is a private investigator who uses methods that may or may not be ethical. Regardless, the man gets the job done. One day, Mrs. Wonderly (Mary Astor) approaches him asking for his protection from a man named Floyd Thursby. His partner is murdered when tailing the man. This sets off a string of deceit, lies, and perhaps even more killing. Why is this all happening? It seems as if a gold falcon statuette is at the heart of all these mysteries.
I could rave about Bogart's performance, but I already did so. Noir films also allowed the central female characters to shine. It gave them a voice. That is what Mary Astor's character was here; a strong, tough woman who didn't give in to the cliches. Our main heroes do not even follow the cliché where the hero gets the girl in a sense. I loved how the relationship between Bogart and Astor worked out. The menacing Sydney Greenstreet delivered big time in a supporting performance and as the film's villain. He appeared on stage, but never in the movies. Huston gave him the opportunity and he made the best of it creating a memorable villain. Peter Lorre is also fantastic as Greenstreet's henchman. You would notice that most of these actors would go on to work with Huston in some degree. After all, the director gave them their big break. With more talkative sequences than action, it was important for the actors to invest in their characters to make them interesting watches. They certainly succeeded.
Any movie about searching for treasure or hard-boiled detective story, I'm there. John Huston's The Maltese Falcon is a stylish, innovative feature that essentially created its own genre. The black-and-white lighting and camera angles gave the film a dark, shadowy feel. Huston did a great job with his writing and directing to create a tense and foreboding atmosphere despite a series of conversations within an interior set. Bogart proved why he is a leading man. He is complimented by the strong supporting performances from Astor, Greenstreet, and Lorre. If you need an introduction to what film-noir is, look no further than Huston's debut masterpiece.

109,itamarscomix,A noir landmark,7,23 September 2011,"Like many classic films, The Maltese Falcon just can't be as impressive now as it was when it was released. The main reason, however, is not that the film aged badly; rather that almost every aspect of it was copied, homaged and parodied so many times since, that it may appear as a a cliché, when in fact it's the original. For good reason it's often known as the original Film Noir - not counting early proto-examples like M - as it defined almost every rule of the genre (not including, surprisingly enough, first-person narration) so well, that less than a decade later it was easy for directors like Carol Reed, Orson Welles and Billy Wilder to deconstruct them effectively, making The Maltese Falcon look like a too simplistic take on a genre only a few years after it was made.But it stands quite well on its own merit, better in fact than many other thrillers of its time, thanks largely to the gorgeous black & white cinematography, and thanks to the excellent performances from the entire cast bust especially Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet, who are incredibly realistic and convincing compared to what was the norm in American cinema at the time. While it doesn't quite stand the test of time as the masterpiece it's often named as, it does so as a very solid thriller.",The Maltese Falcon
110,jem132,The first true 'noir' and Bogart's star-making role,10,23 April 2006,"'The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of' Humphrey Bogart came out of 1941's 'High Sierra' with more critical plaudits than he had enjoyed at any other time in his career with Warner Bros (with the possible exception of 'The Petrified Forest'). Except he wasn't yet a big star, and Lupino still got billing over him. That all changed when he took on the role as cynical detective Sam Spade in the classic 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Falcon' also established John Huston's career as an exceptional film-maker, and the noir genre.Bogart oozes charisma as the hard-boiled detective Spade. It is a great acting performance that well and truly established the 'Bogart persona'. Spade is dry and cynical, untrusting and seemingly incapable of normal human affection, yet women are entranced by him and men are slightly awed by him. Spade is investigating the murder of his partner, Miles Archer. Things get very tricky, very quickly. Archer was tailing a man for an apparently concerned sister, Ms Wonderley (Mary Astor), when he just happened to be shot. But Ms Wonderley is not who she says she is. She's really a suspicious femme fatale named Brigid O'Shaugnessy who has her eyes both on Spade and on a jewel-encrusted statue of a falcon. Spade then finds himself mixed up with a whole bunch of shady characters who are all desperate to get their sweaty hands on this elusive bird.The falcon works as the McGuffin (a Hitchock trademark)in this saga. Everyone wants it, and would even commit murder to get it. Fat man Kaspar Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, absolutely wonderful in the role) is particularly interested in the bird, and he is the one who has hired a whole team of high-living low-lives including Brigid, Joel Cairo (The marvelous Peter Lorre)and Wilmer Cook to get it in any way they can. Problem is, none of these would-be thieves are particularly trustworthy.Others have commented on Astor's unsuitability for the femme fatale role of Brigid. Astor does look a tad matronly as the dangerous woman Spade is most interested in, but her school-girl appearance and vulnerable manner add to the ambiguous nature of her character. Femme fatales are double-crossing, elusive, smart, dangerous females, and she has those qualities in droves.It is the first screen pairing of Lorre and Greenstreet in 'Falcon'. Greenstreat drips with perspiration and charm as the most intriguing character of the bunch, Gutman. Lorre's turn as the effeminate Cairo is spot-on. The portrayal of Cairo is also notable because of the homosexual element attached to it. Cairo is clearly gay by today's standards, and this is shown in Old Hollywood through his gestures, high-pitched voice and the gardenia-perfumed business card he leaves for Spade.Rising above all the shifty characters is the style. Indeed, style was probably the most important component of noir, and 'Falcon' has it in spades (pardon the pun). The plot is complicated and ultimately flawed, yet the shadows, lighting, mood and atmosphere are all perfect. 'Falcon' is positively dripping with suspense and intrigue, so we can forgive the dodgy plot for this. The script is immaculate, one of the best produced by Hollywood in the 40's, and the whole product is fresh. I doubt this film will ever get old.9/10.",The Maltese Falcon

Certainly it delivers lightweight thrills, set pieces and sharp one-liners as well as any low budget film and is almost a template for the thousand laconic private-eye movies (serious and otherwise) that followed.It also set Humphrey Bogart on the road to being the ultimate (film) private detective: A wonderful invention in that they  can be both criminal and policeman as convenience dictates. However, at the risk of seeming negative too soon, there is plenty of things wrong with this movie, most notably the one-dimensional back-of-a-cigarette-packet plot. Where is the suspense when pointing a gun at our hero makes no difference to his demeanour? Do we really believe that the villains will outwit Spade and  actually carry off their quarry? Or that Spade will fall for the lame excuses and explanations given in the movie?Bogart is one of those actors that tries not to gesture or even blink. Variety comes by way of  talking in double time or wisecracking. It really reminds me of what Robert De Niro said about acting ""people don't show emotions - they try to hide them."" The death of his partner (one of the driving points of this movie) doesn't seem to upset him too much, his first thoughts are about removing his name from the door! However, despite his lack of height or conventional good looks, the camera loves him and that is all that matters. He is cooler than a snowman in a  North Pole blizzard.Lorre and Greenstreet are rolled in almost like a comedy double act, with all the menace of second-hand car salesmen (however many guns they pull out). We know that cheats don't prosper in this Warner Brothers film noir world, but they obviously haven't read the rules. They still seem to enjoy their moment of being ""king of the castle"" and chew the furniture to order, but these people are clearly not in our hero's league.While highly enjoyable, the Maltese Falcon hardly takes cinema to new levels. If Bogart had not made this movie, but everything else had stayed the same, it would be a totally forgotten work - like the prior version of this same film.Arm Bogie with a few one-liners, dress him in a dirty raincoat and plonk him on those cheap  hardboard-and-smoke Warner Brothers sets and you have solid gold.

I agree with those who think that the role of Ms. O'Shaughnessy perhaps should've gone to someone more glamourous in appearance.

This beginning of a career for me is incomprehensibly good. I am aware that this is a film adaptation of the novel. However, this directorial beginning is rarely seen.The story revolves around a private investigator, who gets involved with three greedy, reckless and murderous adventurers who compete with each other to get the famous statue of the falcon encrusted jewels worth millions. The story is formidable circled, accompanied by excellent detective dialogues"" and I have nothing to add.

The term of Maltese Falcon is certainly mystical, but the mysteries of the statue is in relation to other elements of the film fell into the background. Humphrey Bogart (Sam Spade) with his left hand epitomized detective of all time. Ambiguous hero who is both honorable and greedy. Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy is femme fatale. Damsel in distress or rather trouble in the girl. I think that Astor is not up to Bogart. Although I'm not sure in my statement given to the scene at the end of the film. Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo just shines. Slimy, polished and professional. He's hard to find fault with. Every phenomenon requires slap in the face, shifty is sleek and evil. Perfect. Sidney Greenstreet as extremely eloquent Kasper Gutman, the nicest character. The villain which is pleasant to look at.

115,esteban1747,"Spade, a man with six senses",7,26 August 2005,"Most of the people who have seen this film argue that it is not understandable how the private detective Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) arrived to his conclusions, finding out the real guilty people of the murder of his partner. Looking the film carefully, one can see that Spade is always laughing with some roguishness after questioning all people likely to be implied in the murder as well as in the business of the black bird. This is a sign that he was already ""cooking"" something in his brains but during the film he did not show any finding until its end. So this final part of the film is not illogic as some may believe. Talking concretely about the film I found that Bogart was the right choice of Huston to play the role of Spade. Before making the film the proposed actor was George Raft, but Huston never agreed having him for the role of Spade. Another important finding was the inclusion of Sidney Greenstreet for the first time in a big screen. Certainly he played very well the role of selfish and arrogant Kasper Gutman. The other components, Mary Astor and Peter Lorre did what was required from them.

Houston directs well and the pace never lets up; a new location means a bad guy hiding behind a door, or a someone with a fatal bullet wound stumbling in the entrance behind you. Bogart gets to say all the best lines (though Greenstreet is given some awful stuff to spout at times, far too much of that ""I like a man who...""). Mary Astor is a letdown as the femme fatal - very wooden, and completely lacking in smoulder. The continuity, even for 1941, is neglected badly - eyelines and postures are often out-of-kilter on the match cut.

Everything about it just clicks. Bogart, Astor, Greenstreet, Lorre etc. What a remarkable cast! I also own Dahshiell Hammett's novel, and Sam Spade is even darker in the book than he is on screen. This is still one of Bogart's finest showings, and will probably never be forgotten. Greenstreet became an overnight star thanks to his brilliant performance here, thoroughly deserved.Director John Huston does a marvellous job of bringing the book to the screen, and I think this is the THIRD version of the story to be filmed! Who says all remakes are bad? This is one of those remakes that ensures the earlier versions are pretty much forgotten today.The snappy dialogue is some of the best and most memorable ever put on screen, so I'm not going to repeat it here; but the film creates its own dark world full of shady characters always out to keep Spade from getting close to the truth. The film is so good you almost forget the murder of Spade's partner at the beginning that kicks off events.A truly superb movie, that I can watch over and over again with renewed pleasure.

118,silverscreen888,Logical; Powerful; the First Hard-boiled Detective Story; Good,8,25 June 2005,"Someone finally had to make this film, and from a Dashiell Hammettnove; John Huston did, doing the final script himself. I claim this script is very different because instead of pseudo-Christian clichés, realpolitik arguments for the need to commit crimes or altruistic nonsense, Hammett portrayed a group of ruthless people going after a fortune, and ridding themselves of anyone who stands in their way. They unfortunately encounter a noir ""hero'--a man whose ethics have to do with using his own judgment--and who is applying it to reality and to them. The cast is famously good under Huston's direction. Humphrey Bogart is logical and powerful as Sam Spade, a man out to avenge his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan). Archer's neurotic wife had seduced him and is still chasing (Gladys George). Enter those in pursuit of the ""Maltese Falcon"", an Hitchcockian Magoffin of first-rate usefulness to the plot. The quartet includes Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Greenstreet's hired gunsel, Elisha Cook Jr. What ensues is a series of explanations to the police, arguments, attempted murders, real ones and definitions of the quartet and of Bogart in terms of their willingness to do others harm in order to get the bird or not. Bogart's secretary is played by fine actress Lee Patrick, and Barton McLane is a tough and believable cop,aided by Ward Bond. This is not a great film; but it is the first realistic detective film of all time, and as such of huge influence on the genre, on writers including Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane, Frank Gruber and other early masters. Adolph Deutsch did the music. Like ""Goldfinger"", this is too pat a storyline to be great. But the logic is flawless; and the scenes where Spade argues for the need to blame the goings on on Cook and Astor are priceless: ""I'm sorry, baby--you're taking the fall..."" This is also the signature piece. of detective fiction, brought to a climax in Leigh Brackett's later script for ""The Big Sleep"". Perhaps not a classic; but the next best thing -- a very seminal success.",The Maltese Falcon
119,davidcarniglia,"""It's the stuff dreams are made of""",10,18 November 2020,"The gold standard of film noir, and one of the most discussed movies of its era, The Maltese Falcon is also regarded as the film that made Humphrey Bogart. Sam Spade (Bogart) is carrying on with his partner's (Jerome Cowan as Miles) wife, Ida (Gladys George); Miles is murdered while on an investigation for Brigid (Mary Astor). Sam is drawn into an evolving case concerning the priceless statue, the falcon; throwing snares and roadblocks in his path are assorted hoods Joel Castro, Kaspar Gutman, and Wilmer Cook (Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Elisha Cook, Jr.). ...Clever set-up, plotting, pacing, superb performances from a great cast; moody, dangerous atmosphere, and the ever-snappy dialogue.Effie (Lee Patrick) let's Sam know that a client awaits him. ""She's a knockout!"" She's Weterby (Astor) trying to find her sister, who might be with a man named Thursby. When Miles shows up fills him in. Miles gets shot that night attempting to renedevous with the mysterious sister and Thursby. He calls hih partner's wwith the news. Sam goes to the crime scene and talks to dectective Polhaus (Ward Boyd). The mysterious client Wetherby Sam gets home, detective and lieutenant (Benton MacLean) pop in; peppering him with questions about his client. After some give and take, they're square for the moment.Thursby's dead too; headlines say the two murders are linked. At his office, Effie tells Sam that Iva is waiting for him; she as much accuses him of killing Miles, then leaves? ""Are you going to marry Ida?"" Snickers Effie; she hints that maybe Ida killed him. Anyway, the mystery woman Weberly calls and wants to see Sam. At which point she reveals her real identity. There's more, but she won't confide any more just now ""I need help just now"". He knows that she's still playing him. So, she tells him about Thursby; she's certain that he killed Archer. Thursby had been a bodyguard for a gambler. Who killed him?For a small fee, he'll pursue the matter--whatever it is. Now Cairo comes to see him. He wants Sam to recover an ""ornament"", i.e., the falcon. When Effie leaves, Cairo pulls a gun on him; but Sam quickly turns the tables. Sam goes through the knocked out would be client...then Cairo comes to. $5k for the statue is still his offer. Maybe, says Sam. Someone's (it's Wilmer) tailing Sam that night. He goes back to Brigid; she must be connected to Cairo somehow. They talk about the falcon. She ""buys"" him with a kiss.She needs to talk to Cairo; Sam arranges that. Cairo shows up--theyve both seen Wilmer lurking about. Obviously, the business at hand is about the Falcon. Cairo hadn't got the $5k, she hadn't got the Falcon. The cops drop in. ""There's talk going around about you going around with Archer's wife..."" Ok, but that gets him off of killing Thursby. Meanwhile Brigid scuffles with Cairo. The cops get the straight dope, but then a cover story. ""I hope you know what you're doing, Sam"" says Polhaus.Everyone but Brigid leaves. She starts to tell Sam about the Falcon ""is there any truth at all in that yarn."" In Cairo's hotel he finds Wilmer, who's shooed off by Polhaus. Then Cairo shows up; ""I felt distinctly like an idiot"" he says, having had to talk to the police. At Sam's office Effie takes a call from Gutman. Brigid's waiting. She still has an affected manner. Ida comes to apologize for her accusations; but business calls: Gutman that is. So we see that Wilmer is Gutman's gopher. ""Era talk about the black bird."" Obviously, it's worth a fortune. Sam says he knows where it is.Anyway, Sam storms out, and huddles with the D.A. and his assistant. He's trying to clear himself; it's true that unless he finds the murderer, he's still a suspect. Next move is to roust Wilmer, and have another bag fest with Gutman. So, once again, let's talk about the"" stupid falcon. We get the crusader background of the falcon. Hundreds of years of tribute, jewels, etc. And it's whereabouts since 1700. ""I haven't got it--I'm going to get it."" It's worth $50k to retrieve it. First problem is, same drugged by Gutman, as Cairo and Wilmer look on. Left alone, Sam staggers to his senses. He calls Effie, Brigid is missing (she'd been taken in by Effie).In Gutman's place he sees a notation about a freighter docking. When he gets to the waterfront, the boats on fire. Jacoby, near death, stumbles into Sam's office as Effiie patches him up. He drops a bundle on the floor. ""We've got it angel, we've got it!"" The falcon. Brigid calls, sounding fearful. Then a scream--have the guys gotten to her? He goes to the hotel lobby and mails the bundle to a p.o. box; then takes a cab to Burlingame. The address he has is just a vacant lot. No Brigid. Back home, there she is. Unfortunately, so are Gutman, Cairo, and the trigger-happy Wilmer. Well, Gutman gives him $10k. That's all. Sam says they need a fall guy to explain the murders.Hey, isn't Wilmer a good fit for three killings? Sam isn't above some radical brinkmanship. ""It's our best bet!"" Gutman even says he'd thought of that ploy himself. Sam will hand Wilmer to the D.a. on a plastic tray. Plan B and C: finger Cairo, or Brigid? Sam himself is basically untouchable, because he's the only one that knows where the statue is. It's Wilmer getting the shirt straw; he pulls his gun, which Brigid, then Sam gets a hold of it. So, the desk: the Falcon for Wilmer. The details of the murders spills out if the fat man's mouth so Sam can figure out what to tell the cops. Gutman was even responsible for the ship fire.All three of the conspirators stare down ominously at the pitiful Wilmer. Well, there's the $10k. This scene is a touch too long. Sam calls Effie to retrieve the falcon. Here we are: do,let's take a look. It's it's a Falcon. But is it The Falcon? No. Sam thinks that Brigid has duped them, Cairo blames Gutman. More importantly, the meeting breaks up. But, what's this? Sam calls Poulhaus: the whole deal on Wilmer and the murders.With the obvious bad guys gone, he grills Brigid about Miles. (Remember that that he had an instant attraction for him.) Basically, she used Miles to take care of Thursby, and then she killed the private detective. Now her only card to play is to suddenly tell Sam that she loves him. He doesn't care, but admits that ""maybe"" he loves her too. ""Don't be too sure that I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be."" Just as they embrace, Polhaus shows up, Brigid's toast. Everyone leaves. Sam is left explaining the statue,it's ""the stuff dreams are made of."" The end.The Maltese Falcon operates on more than one level. It's really as much about Sam dealing with his life, the mayhem surrounding the murders, as it is about the Falcon, which turns out to be fake. In he largest sense, the story is a mythic quest. The Falcon represents what we (through Sam's point-of-view) strive for; and, even though it turns out to be inauthentic, we find out a lot about ourselves along the way. In short--we have the experience of a lifetime. Things don't turn out as we think, and the objective is less important than the journey for it.Viewing Bogart's role itself, he's anything but a traditional hero; or so it seems. About the only one that he shows genuine respect for is Effie. But that's because she proves to be the only one he can trust. Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer are out-and-out crooks--of different pay grades. Both Ida and Brigid are opaque connivers. The police more or less get what Sam's deal is. Like Effie, they've got no personal interest in the statue. In other words, Sam disdains people because most of them are working angles, and are therefore insincere and not very decent.There isn't even the satisfaction that Sam will get closer to Effie; maybe they're relationship is just fine for both of them. The story more or less restores the status quo--Sam's made some money, but his partner's dead. No statue, no small or large fortune. It seems damning that Sam is kind of blase about Miles' death; that would be strange, but then Miles shows his true colors right off by flirting with around with the first attractive woman (Brigid) who walks in the door.I've mentioned the talky nature of the last get-together; those sorts of protagonist/antagonist meeting generally work well in this type of movie to show where everyone's at, and who knows what. But it gets stagey after awhile.With that quibble, this is an excellent movie. It starts quickly, and only pauses to catch us up here and there. Can't miss the Maltese Falcon.",The Maltese Falcon

This is a riveting story of a private detective named Sam Spade (played by Bogart) whose partner gets murdered but at first no one even knows who did it. I have not seen a film in that genre from director John Huston since the Hitchcockian film Key Largo. In the end i kind of found it funny when i found that the falcon was priceless when i actually thought it was worth something. There is a lot of top notch performances especially from Humphrey Bogart,Peter Lorre,Sydney Greenstreet (in his film debut),and Mary Astor. Director John Huston's directorial genius aside from the great performances throughout the film is really what made the film absolutely entertaining. For some reason this kind of feels like a picture from Director Alfrred Hitchcock when it was not set up to be directed by him. But i had no problem with Huston's direction and i didn't find a false note anywhere or in any scene of the film.",The Maltese Falcon
122,dr_foreman,perfect adaptation,8,24 March 2004,"I don't think I've ever seen such a faithful, pitch-perfect film adaptation of a novel.  True, Hammett's ""Maltese Falcon"" does feature a nude scene and more explicit references to homosexuality, but aside from that, this film is missing nothing (and, arguably, it's all the better for avoiding the ""direct"" approach to certain issues).  All you need to do is look at the other film versions of the same book to see that only this one is a classic; only this one really captures the right tone.Of course, that tone is somewhat unpleasant; Spade is not the nicest character, and everyone else is worse.  It's perhaps hard to swallow that Spade would deceive and cheat his partner in so many ways, but then get worked up about the man's death.  But I can buy it; aren't we all fallible and inconsistent?  Certainly, Philip Marlowe presents a more likable figure in ""The Big Sleep,"" but Spade is clearly a more well-defined character.The trouble is, ""The Big Sleep"" is noticeably more modern than this movie, and more entertaining.  By comparison, ""The Maltese Falcon"" is not terribly sexy (I'm not sure that Astor works as a seductress) and rather slow-paced. However, these two sins don't detract (much) from the film's success.  The supporting cast is so perfect (aren't Greenstreet and Lorre just the greatest character actors of all time?) and the music is so evocative that I can forgive the odd slip or slowdown.A perhaps pointless aside: Susan Sontag calls this a ""camp"" film, probably because it tries very hard to be serious but is, in fact, exaggerated and a bit silly.  But exaggeration is exactly what the detective genre, and the original novel, are all about.  ""The Maltese Falcon"" has no cause to be embarrassed by its camp label, then.  It accomplishes what it sets out to do - it entertains while telling a rather lurid, over-the-top cautionary tale about greed and deception.",The Maltese Falcon

But when the story of a black bird carrying jewels results in his friend's death, even Spade is bound by a unique code of honor to track the killer. In his journey he meets femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor), the effeminate Joel Cairo (a lovely performance by Peter Lorre), and the comical Kasper Gutman (Sidney Greenstreet. It's hard to see in this collection of villains anything threatening by today's standards. However their fluency is unmatched.Dialogues were always the best part of these movies, with their back-and-forth battle of wits and cool one-liners.

(Although top-billed, his name was after the title, and instead of being shown singularly, he was listed first among four stars' names shown simultaneously on-screen.)It is memorable, also, as a film which included Greenstreet and Lorre, who, despite not having had the longest of tenures, and who were as far from leading-man types as anyone, are among the most-remembered in film history.Finally, Humphrey, Sidney and Peter represent examples of presences of average, very large, and diminutive physical size - whether on-screen or off. They also each possessed different, but extremely distinctive voices, all of which have been among the most-imitated by impressionists for the many years from their active periods to the present.All of the above, along with an outstanding story and supporting cast, are displayed in a thoroughly-entertaining fashion in this great film.",The Maltese Falcon

Of course, he sort of owe all his good fortune to George Raft as we all know but could you even imagine Raft in this role. I certainly can't.As for the other performers, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are the two most hilarious interpreters of evil ever to be put on film. It is easy to see why Warner Bros. tried to capitalize on this pair in numerous other movies of the 40's. As for Mary Astor, she really revels in ""phoniness"" and by that I mean portraying con man, one of the first played as a female.John Huston, the director, certainly knew what he was doing and he gets the atmosphere of 40's seediness just right. The movie is mostly played at night, as are many other detective movies. He knows not to inform us about too much of the story and when we see who actually ""did it"" it comes as a genuine surprise.So, if you are one of those who hate black and white movies, you might wanna avoid this, but if you can look beyond that you will never find one that still holds up today as one of the best movies ever.",The Maltese Falcon

It's authentic, an engaging experience for the viewer right into the insides of the detective world, a grand prize involved, the complex plot with various characters and sides leading to the one same goal, the acting is assertive, energetic...But all in all, what we really get is a ton of that fast tough-guy talk for the whole way, even the ""action scenes"" really are a steady-paced piece of narrative, and whether or not this film certainly has its qualities in what it does it is still non-stop dialog which requires all the viewer's attention while not delivering much more than just what one could expect at the beginning of it. There isn't much surprise, anything in the way of its basic plot, if not for the expected turns of tides as Bogart's character is one of great verve and guts, not willing to give away an inch to his dissidents.It makes for quite a linear experience, and while again it achieves what it sets out to do, for non-fanatics of the genre it remains there is a flatness about it with a tinge of predictability or even monotony, but a fine product of its realm nonetheless.",The Maltese Falcon

I laugh when people complain that Citizen Kane was ""robbed"" of the Best Picture Oscar in a year that produced such classics as SUllivan's Travels, How Green Was My Valley (a film that was more than deserving of winning top prize), and The Maltese Falcon. John Huston, son of the great Walter Huston had never before made a film when he began his feature, The Maltese Falcon. Starring Humphrey Bogart, who I also make no secret of absolutely adoring, the story follows the pursuit of a priceless statue by a band of criminals and a private eye. Bogart and Huston would collaborate multiple times throughout their careers, always seeming to attempt to capitalize on the magic they made in The Maltese Falcon. It's incredible when a first-time director can make a film as good as The Maltese Falcon, which must go down as one of the best debuts of all time.Working as a private eye in a San Fransico detective agency, Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) are approached by a woman who calls herself Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor). Spade and Archer who have always shared a tempestuous relationship argue over how to handle the case, when Archer insists on providing the protection Miss Wonderly has requested. Things change pretty quickly as Archer is killed the night he is protecting Miss Wonderly, along with another man, and Spade quickly finds himself in the middle of an international mystery. It is soon revealed that Miss Wonderly is surrounded by dangerous people, all of whom Spade soon gets the chance to meet. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is a man after a mysterious take who uses scents to incapacitate his victims. She also has Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) on her heels, a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants ann under the guise of feigned civility. The only one seemingly able to provide her some protection is Sam Spade who has now been implicated in the murder of Archer or Floyd Thursby, the man that was also killed the same night at Archer. Finding the Maltese Falcon the criminals are hunting for may be the only way for Spade to help himself, or anyone else. Huston, a novice director made a brilliant decision to film a good deal of action over the shoulder of Bogart's shoulder. Allowing the audience to see a majority of the action from the point of view of the protagonist was an exceptionally innovative way to keep the audience engaged. Huston Not that innovative camera work is needed to keep one engaged during a Humphrey Bogart film. He truly was one of the best actors in the history of cinema to grace the screens. Peter Lorre, a consistently strong supporting actor, was also an absolute joy to watch. The symmetry achieved by Huston, especially in shots framing Humphrey Bogart, reveal an early expertise present in the filmmaker. an exceptional cast helmed by an excellent leading man Humphrey Bogart, a more than apt director, and a plot based on the work of the wonderful Dashiell Hammett produced an American classic that still persists nearly 80 years after its release.",The Maltese Falcon

We are only allowed to meet others involved in the plot when Sam Spade meets them and this keeps us wholly dependent on him - keep up with him or even get ahead of him if we're able to. To keep us concentrated on him, the camera never shows us who he's speaking to on the other end of the many phone conversations. I really liked this story-telling device. There are no flashbacks to any of the many important earlier parts of the story. If Sam wasn't there, it's not important for us to see. This is ingeniously done but it does mean explanations of these events have to be told to us instead of being shown to us. And who is telling the truth anyhow? In the confusion we have to trust that Bogart will see us through and eventually reveal the truth.

135,avik-basu1889,The First Film-Noir !!!,7,2 May 2017,"'The Maltese Falcon' is highly influential, oppressively dark and it presents a deeply pessimistic view of the world and life in Depression Era USA. The screenplay is very carefully structure and maneuvered to keep the viewer in the dark for almost the entirety of the film just like its protagonist Sam Spade. There is very impressive camera-work and crafty usage of lighting on show here which to a great extent laid down the framework for the visual language for film-noir. Reminiscent of German Expressionism, we see deliberately prominent shadows everywhere and a big chunk of the film gets engulfed by an oppressively, dark visual texture complimenting the thematic tone of the film. Like other noir films, the characters, including Spade himself are deliberately made to lack a sense of morality and they are shown to be greedy emotionless organisms who have opted to choose a life involving a constant pursuit of material gains, instead of being burdened by the worthless weight of a conscience.However if I have to be honest, even though I found myself relatively pleased and impressed by Huston's edginess and the colourful characters, I was never really bowled over by the film. I can easily understand and admire why it is so influential and important in American film history, but I'd be lying if I say the film and its contents lingered in my thoughts for a long time after it came to its conclusion. Whenever there is a film where the director is deliberately forcing the characters and the plot to remain and feel distant to the viewer, it has to be captivating and for the lack of a more appropriate term - fun. I find this aforementioned fun(along with thematic depth) in abundance while watching other noir films like 'Sunset Boulevard', 'Sweet Smell of Success', 'Ace in the Hole', etc. to name a few. Unfortunately 'The Maltese Falcon' never did manage to give me a similar fun experience at least on this first viewing which prevented me from being swept up by the film.I admire the quippy, razor sharp dialogue, I admire the technical elements like Huston and his cinematographer's lighting and intricate camera-work, I admire the colourful characters and the actors portraying them, but unfortunately I couldn't 'love' the film and as a whole it left me a bit underwhelmed.",The Maltese Falcon

Sure, there are some more famous movies that he's been in...but in this film he is so unflinching and believably bad ass that it makes you wonder 'was he really ACTING?' It seems like he's just being himself. More so than any performance I think I've ever seen.The story is great: a group of ne'er do wells is looking for a jewel-encrusted statue of a bird and private investigator Sam Spade (Bogie) gets mixed up in it. The plot takes many twists and turns and end in a grandiose Hollywood-style ending that leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth.Modern day actors should be forced to watch this movie fifty times before being allowed to act in a film.

Huston, who wrote the screenplay himself, stuck very closely to the novel on which the picture was based. The fine ensemble including the ever suave tough guy Humphey Bogart, Mary Astor, newcomer Sidney Greenstreet, Elisha Cook Jr., Peter Lorre and Ward Bond took a beautiful piece of Film Noir and turned it into a screen legend that still works well some sixty-five years later. Sam Spade would go on to be one of the most memorable characters in motion picture history, and the film is regularly regarded to be among the top 100 films of all time. I have seen the colorized version of this film and ""frankly"", as Rhett Butler would have put it, ""I didn't give a damn."" This film was made for black and white, to suit the mood of the piece.

140,jayjaycee,Intriguing and revolutionary piece of film noir!,8,30 November 2020,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is a 1941 film noir directed by John Huston starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor.
⚪
All in all, John Huston's directorial debut wickedly wheels above a mysteriously mischievous and complexly crafted game of chess that is defined by pure mistrust, unadulterated greed, merciless betrayal and more negative traits the human nature is able to display, and thanks to a suave leading performance by Bogart, a cleverly multifaceted narration and an intriguingly smart plot it becomes a twisted and most importantly, packing film noir treat that offers a lot of surprises, and is considered to be a revolutionary entry to the sub-genre for a reason.
⚪
One year after I first came up with the idea, I am now able to translate my undertaking into action: #ItsAHumphreyBogartChristmas is a project I conceived last Christmas when I found some of the legendary actor's movie under the tree and thought ""Why don't I turn this into a project next year?"", and here we are now, when a concept comes to life one year after it was first thought about. You probably wonder what this all is about, and I am going to tell you: This season, I will watch one Bogart classic film on every Advent Sunday, before I round it up by watching ""We Are No Angels"" on the first day of Christmas, a day that also happens to be the legend's day of birth. So, as some sort of countdown to both, the holidays and his birthday, I will watch some of his finest works. And this early film noir was undeniably a great way to kick off the adventure. In what happens to be the directorial debut of famous director John Huston, Bogie plays the smooth private detective Samuel Spade who unwittingly gets caught in a web of greed, betrayal and malevolence, and I assure you, it is film noir in its most classic and rawest form. The story is based on the novel of the same name by author Dashiell Hammett, but unlike the first adaptation from nineteen-thirty-one which (allegedly, I haven't seen it) went into a more comedic direction, Huston's take ventured into darker realms. Reportedly, this film here defined the film noir as we know it today, and I can see why. Aside from some instances of more or less dark humour and sneaky verbal altercations, the comedic nature has vanished completely, and instead, there is a suspenseful feeling of danger as well as multiple exhibitions of human's depravity. How? Well, when protagonist Sam Spade is entangled in a murder case after being consulted by the beautiful Brigid O'Shaughnessy, he is furthermore approached by other shady characters, namely Joel Cairo and Kasper Gutman, and all three want the same thing from him: The Maltese Falcon, a statuette of great worth, and since its whereabouts are officially unknown, knowing is the most valuable argument in this conflict. However, what makes this it so special and different in comparison to other titles of the genre is the fact that we already know in the middle of the film who has murdered whom, and that the only problem the investigator has is to get out of it and prove his innocence to the police who accused him of the murder. Since his opponents don't want to share the loot, and don't want others to know about the bird's true value, he is furthermore in constant danger for knowing to much. For an unusually high amount of times, he is hold at gunpoint and only slightly manages to get out alive with the cunning his profession caused him to have, and believe me, on many occasions I thought that the way he is talking big will be the death of him in the end. How does he manage to survive and prove his innocence, though? Well, the most brilliant aspect of this conflict is how he plays with the interests of his opponents and uses their greed for profit, intrigues and weaknesses against them. In a clever manner, Bogart, who portrays the shrewd detective superbly, plays all three ends against the middle and, almost audaciously, sets them all against each other while also finding a way to bust them. Even the girl that was introduced as a femme fatale and love interest gets what she deserves! It's a brilliant display of trust and betrayal, as well as an exposition of human behaviour when said humans would sell their own grandmothers to obtain a fortune, and even if Spade is not a gangster himself, his cool methods and his bold and calculated anture are extremely perfidious, nevertheless, and thus he has something of an antihero to him. In the end, this title is indeed a revolutionary film and, surprisingly, offers an absolute clever writing of which the level of intelligence hasn't been met today. Atmospheric, well-acted and undeniably intriguing film noir that deservedly bears the title of being a classic. What a phenomenal start to this project!",The Maltese Falcon

142,Eternality,"The Maltese Falcon is like a mind game played by crafty people. It is constantly twisting and turning, yet in the end, it works very well as an old-school mystery-drama.",9,13 August 2010,"In classical Hollywood cinema, The Maltese Falcon came first on many counts. It was the first film directed by the legendary John Huston, the director of classics such as The African Queen (1951) and The Treasure of Sierra Madre (1948). It was also the film that propelled Humphrey Bogart from a B-list nobody to an A-list hero, molding him into one of the medium's greatest stars. In addition, the film was also one of the first few films that kick-started the sub-genre of film noir, influencing many films from Reed's The Third Man (1949) to Polanski's Chinatown (1974).The Maltese Falcon brought Peter Lorre (who made his name as the villain in Lang's M (1931)) and Sydney Greenstreet into the limelight as talented supporting actors, both of whom would collaborate with Bogart again in Curtiz's Casablanca (1942). Bogart plays Sam Spade who runs a private investigation agency together with Miles Archer, his co-partner. When a mysterious woman calls upon them to help her tail a suspect, Archer is murdered that night. Spade digs into the mystery and finds himself embroiled in a crime to steal a prized statuette of a falcon.The Maltese Falcon features memorable performances from Bogart, Lorre, and Greenstreet. Dialogue-heavy and with a strong focus on character development, Huston's film is neatly balanced between seriousness and playfulness. Sarcastic exchanges of remarks by the trio as they try to one up each other in an elaborate game of verbal ping-pong inject both comic relief and tension to the proceedings. The screenplay, also written by Huston, is deservedly nominated for an Oscar.Igniting the Hollywood film noir wave of the 1940s, The Maltese Falcon may not have as distinct a visual style as Casablanca or Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) where low-intensity lighting and shadows create a strong contrast between black and white, but it has a strong plot rooted in crime-fiction with the central figure as a cynical private detective who is not your archetypal hero. Huston's feature debut lays some of the groundwork that would become a staple of future noir pictures.The Maltese Falcon remains engaging by modern standards. By opting not to show the statuette of the falcon until the last fifteen minutes, Huston creates intrigue in the viewer. Moreover, the characters in the film do seem to have hidden agendas and ulterior motives, but they never reveal their true intentions but merely hint at what is to be expected. In a way, The Maltese Falcon is like a mind game played by crafty people. It is constantly twisting and turning, yet in the end, it works very well as an old-school mystery-drama.SCORE: 9/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",The Maltese Falcon
143,tcchelsey,PROBABLY THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL,10,12 March 2021,"If THE MALTESE FALCON isn't one of the all time great noir/ mysteries, it has to be the most recognizable. The film has been analyzed to the degree that it now can fall into the category of being psycho-analyzed. If you want to take a short cut through all the messaging, bottom line, it truly was the ultimate screen test to stardom for Humphrey Bogart, no ifs ands or buts. The film solidified his career in addition to breaking ground for film noir. There is a tad more to add here, if you look at it from another vantage point. What I have discovered after many decades of viewing is this classic mystery is presented, in a way, as a contest of sorts, between Bogey and Mary Astor, the actors, as to who can top who. This is, by far, the perfect storm of a perfect match. Likewise, their characters neatly try to outdo one another simultaneously, without giving too much of the story away here. Ofcourse, if you've seen this movie before, you get the idea, and it's fairly clever. Movie history was also achieved with the fascinating teaming of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, who have yet to be eclipsed by anyone else to this day. And accolades also in store for a memorable performance turned in by Elisha Cook, Jr., who was to Greenstreet what Dwight Frye was to Bela Lugosi in DRACULA. Think about it. Simply amazing! So there you have it folks, complete with that classic closing line uttered by Bogey which kind of sums up life as WE know it. Caution though, that THE MALTESE FALCON may become habit forming.

Mary Astor shows her talent with her brilliant portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy. She goes from innocent victim to cold blooded killer effortlessly.And what can a person say about Peter Lorre except he is a legend for a reason. He is one of those people who can make you care about the character even if he is not exactly a good guy. I haven't said anything about the plot, which is stunning. I will only say that it concerns a mysterious idol called the Maltese Falcon. Saying much more would give too much away and that would be a disservice to anyone who has yet to discover this gem.

148,HelloTexas11,doesn't get better than this,10,20 December 2007,"Whenever anyone talks or writes about how wonderful old movies are, I tend to think they're referring to either 'Casablanca' or 'The Maltese Falcon.' Is it a coincidence that both films star Humphrey Bogart? Maybe. Maybe not. The 1941 version of Dashiell Hammett's novel of the same name is a breakneck paced thriller, often thought of as the first in the 'hard-boiled' detective genre. No role ever fit Humphrey Bogart as well as Sam Spade, Private Eye. One of the great things about the movie is that in a sense, we are Sam Spade too. We learn clues as he does; nothing is revealed to the film audience before Spade discovers it. Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy brings the case of the missing statue to Spade, though not in so many words at first. In fact, we are quite deep into the film before we find out exactly what is being sought after, who is seeking it, and how valuable it is. O'Shaughnessy is a habitual liar, but more than that, she makes lying seem like an art form. It is quite entertaining to watch her spin tale after tale in order to obfuscate matters, though eventually we begin to feel Spade's frustration with her. He asks her at one point if there was any truth at all in the story she's just told him. ""Not very much,"" she replies, one of the few honest statements she makes in the whole film. Sydney Greenstreet is the obese Kaspar Gutman (the actor's first screen role at age 61), and as with Bogart, never was there a more perfect match of character and actor. Greenstreet is very well-suited to deliver Gutman's literate yet verbose rapid-fire dialogue. Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is his effeminate sometimes accomplice in the search for the 'black bird.' And Elisha Cook Jr. is the gunsel Wilmer, whom Spade loves tormenting. After relieving Wilmer of his two guns, Spade tells Gutman, ""A crippled newsie took 'em away. I made him give 'em back."" 'The Maltese Falcon' is so uniquely and believably of a time and place far removed from anything in our experience that it doesn't seem dated at all. It's a world that doesn't exist outside of detective novels such as the ones Hammett and Raymond Chandler wrote. Did it ever really exist? Probably not, at least not in the way they present it. But we are drawn into it and buy the whole premise, hook, line and sinker. Which is exactly what the greatest movies do. It is worth taking note of the climax, which is a surprising one, and not because the falcon turns out to be fake. The real surprise comes in Spade's final speech to O'Shaughnessy, where he tells her she's going to prison for killing his partner. It is an oddly moving, almost heroic statement about the private eye's code, about the life they choose to lead and the rules they go by. Spade, up to this point, has acted as though Miles Archer's death meant little to him but it is revealed at the end to be his primary motivation in solving the case and finding the culprit. O'Shaughnessy can hardly believe what she's hearing. Spade had no interest really in recovering the Maltese Falcon or any wealth he might possibly obtain from it; but his code required him to find the person who killed Miles and make sure that person didn't get away with it. She asks him if it would have made a difference if the falcon had been real. ""Don't be too sure I'm as crooked as I'm supposed to be,"" Spade tells her, before handing her over to the police. The black statuette may be ""the stuff dreams are made of,"" but in the end, that's all it is, a dream.",The Maltese Falcon

150,lyubitelfilmov,The Hunt for the Cursed Statuette or the Standard of the Noir Genre,8,7 May 2021,"Detective. The third and most successful film adaptation of the detective novel of the same name by the American writer Dashil Hammett, which became the standard of the then new genre of ""noir"". On this, in essence, you can end the review, but I am not one of those who give up so easily, so I intend to share with you my thoughts and the emotions that this picture gave me. I confess that I wanted to watch it because of the main actor - the charismatic Humphrey Bogart and after watching the good melodrama ""Casablanca"" - and did not regret this decision. And here is my brief opinion - the standard of the genre ""noir"". I did not notice any flaws in the picture, although I looked meticulously, so I will only talk about the merits of this creation of American cinema of the early forties of the last century.So, here they are:
1. The script - I have not read the book's original source, but enlightened people argue that this film adaptation almost literally quotes the book, and only in a few places ""smoothes the corners"" so to speak (which is essentially correct, because you should not flirt with one topic) ... A young and pretty girl turns to a detective agency with a request to find one very dangerous person who escaped with her sister. One of the detectives volunteers to help, and he is killed with the same news. His colleague Sam Spade is now simply obliged to find the killer and unravel the tangle of intrigues that entangled this case. Add here charismatic villains, fatal beauties, a magnificent atmosphere, an all-consuming distrust of all those involved in the case, excellent dialogues, I especially liked this phrase:
What is this figurine made of?From unfulfilled hopes. (translation options are slightly different here, but you get the point)And you will get an excellent script with a dashingly twisted detective story, which does not waste time, where there is not a single superfluous scene or detail, and the ending will definitely please you. I will not say that he surprised me (as was the case with Murder on the Orient Express), but delivered the lion's share of pleasure.2. Atmosphere - black and white image, classic men's suits, cigarette smoke, rain, general pessimism and cynical perception of the world, the gloomy protagonist, danger in the air, walking literally on the razor's edge, where nobleness and chivalry have no place - such is he, classic ""noir"", which is loved by viewers of all countries and continents (including me). And it was this picture that determined what this ""noir"" should be like, which had just appeared on the big screens at that time. The atmosphere here plays no less important role than the script, for which this detective is loved.3. Music - tied to the atmosphere almost completely. Mostly disturbing music sounds, in which despair and notes of raging mistrust slip through. Sometimes romance is included, which only confuses the audience. Sometimes hope comes up, but only for a short moment, because the general mood of the picture does not favor such a thing.4. The main character is a gloomy and cynical detective, whose actions are based on only one desire - to find the killer of a colleague, and any deception, any illegal action will do for this. Especially Sam succeeds in clever maneuvers in order to bring criminals to the surface and find out the truth. The lion's share of the hero's success is based on the excellent acting performance of Humphrey Bogart, who embodied all the best features of the collective image of a private detective, although the hero is not devoid of humanity, because sometimes he does rash acts (not very often).5. The Maltese Falcon is not just a statuette of great value, which is hunted by criminals. It is rather an object around which the main events of the picture take place. And the history of this statuette is not important, because the hunt for it exposes all the basest human qualities. And one moment connected with the statuette made me laugh out loud. If you've seen the picture, then you know perfectly well what I'm talking about. And if you didn't look, then look and you yourself will understand everything.6, Finale - as I already wrote, it is predictable, although I was afraid that the hero at the last moment is called ""back"", but this did not happen. The killer was guessed almost from the very beginning (in my opinion), although the investigation itself made me a little nervous. The intrigue did not work, alas!A little about the main characters:
1. Sam Spade performed by Humphrey Bogart is a private investigator who got involved in the Maltese Falcon case only because of the death of a colleague. A cold, unfeeling cynic and selfish who must find out the truth before the police beat him. His eccentric behavior and talkativeness leave a vivid memory and are remembered for a long time. Well, the charisma of the magnificent Humphrey Bogart played an important role in the success of the picture. Bravo Humphrey!2. Ruth Wonderly played by Mary Astor - a pretty young girl who turned to detectives with a request that was the beginning of a series of events and the reason for several murders. Sweet and attractive on the outside but dangerous as hell on the inside. A woman who cannot be trusted in any way, for she skillfully uses beauty in order to confuse men and force them to do what is beneficial only to her. Mary was a great success for this image. Bravo!3. Casper Gutman performed by Sidney Greenstreet is a certain wealthy gentleman hunting the Maltese falcon and ready to suppress the law for the sake of this damn statuette, and not even one. At the same time, you will not deny him his mind and even some charm. And if in ""Casablanca"" Sydney had a not very important role, then here (in his debut) it is even very important and noticeable, not least thanks to Sydney's charisma.So why didn't I give this detective a top score? It's simple - because of the predictable ending. You can take offense at me for this, but I insist, because at one time I was staring at the detective series ""Poirot Agatha Christie"" with the charming David Suchet, and tried not to miss a single episode, and even in them there was an intrigue and the ending was difficult to guess. And here there is no such thing, but does this make this picture bad? Definitely not, because this is a classic ""noir"" and all the other elements of the detective story are good, therefore there is no longer anything to scold ""The Maltese Falcon"" for.As a result, we have a good detective story, with an excellent and dashingly twisted script, a great atmosphere, charismatic characters, great music and great acting. In short - a classic of the noir genre.My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",The Maltese Falcon
151,JaydoDre,Overall interesting but the story has flaws.,7,16 December 2014,"Maltese Falcon is a detective story with Humphrey Bogart in the lead role. It is competently shot and has the proper period music, which as was usual at that time has something to be desired of its recording quality, but is otherwise perfectly acceptable. What is rough however is the story. The plot is interesting but there are a number of flaws, mostly centering around how this films deals with its characters and their dialogue.As the movie progresses, the conversation between the main male character and one of the ladies indicates a romantic relationship between them, but this comes as a surprise because the movie had not built up their relationship in that way so the romanticism comes out of nowhere, and ignores another relationship introduced at the beginning of the movie.At one point a new character suddenly shows up more than half way into the movie for a few seconds and from then on his name becomes an important part of the plot even though we was never properly introduced, so you start wondering if you missed a scene or something.It also has that really convenient bit where the bad guy decides to explain the events because...let's be honest, because the plot calls for it, which is not that bad other than being a movie cliché.There are several times when a character talks on the phone and talks in a manner that explains what is being said on the other side. Monologues are nice and all, but it also looks cheap and lazy, especially when it happens ten or fifteen times as it does.It is a shame because the acting itself is quite good and the dialogue can be smart. Humphrey Bogart has a specific style of delivering sentences, which does not sit comfortable with me, but he is acting well and he plays a fairly interesting character, a bit of a scoundrel in a way that you cannot quite read what his plan is. Something happens to his colleague and he shows no sorrow, which seemed like poor directing at first, but then his situation justifies such a reaction.One of the bad guys is played by Sydney Greenstreet. This old round fellow is adorable and speaks in the most amusing British manner. The movie could stand to lose Humphery Bogart, but not this guy.Another minor complaint is about the missed opportunity of an adventure. If you look at the poster which IMDb.com used for this movie, it shows the main character holding two pistols, a woman and the line ""a story as explosive as his blazing automatics"". Throughout the entire film only one shot is fired. The story is supposed to be about a golden falcon but the movie does not mention or show it nearly often enough. This could have been a much more exciting treasure hunt than what it ended up being – a straight detective story, which is fine. This is the choice they are going with.Overall, an OK movie but the story has flaws.",The Maltese Falcon
152,blakiepeterson,The Film Noir That Dreams Are Made Of,9,20 May 2015,"The Bible forbids us from murder, adultery, and theft, but the characters in ""The Maltese Falcon"" do not have the time to think about their eternal fates in the fiery pits of Hell. They do have time, though, to worship a little black bird statuette encrusted with the finest jewels in the world — and if they have to act against one of The Ten Commandments to get their paws on its onyx beak, so be it. Just thinking about The Maltese Falcon causes their eyes to glaze over, their mouths to water for the thirst of wealth.As Roger Ebert points out in his glowing review of 1941's ""The Maltese Falcon"", the film isn't just a classic audiences have come to fawn over over the years. Consider film noir didn't exist before ""The Maltese Falcon"" was released. That Humphrey Bogart was still a character actor hiding in the shadows of James Cagney and George Raft. That Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet were not yet the supporting player dream team doomed to live on the exaggerated pencils of caricaturists then and now. That John Huston had never directed a film before.I saw ""The Maltese Falcon"" for the first time five years ago, sitting in the pitch-black room of my grandfather's study with his dinosaur laptop on a Saturday night. Then, I was just becoming acquainted with black-and-white films, only familiar with the likes of ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Major and the Minor"". All too young then, I found ""The Maltese Falcon"" to be too talky, to not have enough action. In my original review (my second, to be exact), I cited it as an overrated classic. How times have changed.It's talky, but not too talky; it's a classic, but not an overrated one. It's a cynical character study, the characters greedy, self-indulgent liars on the prowl for unfathomable riches. Instead of liking them, we're fascinated by their methodical actions. We don't connect with them on a human level; we feel the need to unravel their stacked façades, pulling apart the rambling lies and accidental truths spat out in an attempt to double-cross an obstacle. In his (arguably) career-defining role, Humphrey Bogart portrays Sam Spade, a smug private eye hired by the beguiling Miss Wonderly (Mary Astor). Wonderly claims that she is being hounded by a man named Floyd Thursby, needing immediate protection. Sam, nor his partner, Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan), believe her shaky story, but money talks, and she happens to have a lot of it. Later that night, while shadowing Thursby, Archer is shot to death in an alleyway. Thursby, as it turns out, was murdered that night too.Like all great film noir films, things are much more complicated than they first appear. Miss Wonderly's real name is actually Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and O'Shaughnessy isn't just a sexy dame gliding into detective agencies with falsely dramatic stories. She is actually a sinner desperately trying to get her hands on an international treasure otherwise known as The Maltese Falcon. Encrusted with gleaming gems, it is worth thousands. Also frantic for the treasure is Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a mysterious European who walks around with a cane and flowery handkerchiefs, Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet), a cackling, walrus- sized socialite, and his sidekick, the mousy Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.).As the MacGuffin of the jeweled falcon hangs over the heads over the characters, all we can manage is a sense of bewilderment; they are so caught up in their lies, their temptations, that gone is their moral compass, their common sense. The masquerades they put on for Spade, who acts as both a potential fellow shareholder and an outsider, cross the line, in their own psyches, that is, between the real and the fake.Though ""The Maltese Falcon"" was adapted twice before, once in 1931 and again in 1936 as ""Satan Was A Lady"", the 1941 version bears the most distinct personality. In a world of detective agencies, trench coats, cigarette holders, and femme fatales, it is a carnival of film noir tropes before film noir tropes were even a thing. The dialogue is fiendishly clever, all characters putting on an act for the other at all possible times; Huston's direction is equally intelligent, complementing the auras of the characters with subtle camera tricks while keeping a sense of humor hanging above the dark motives of the plot.Just as unmistakable in memorability are the actors. Bogart's sniveling but tough persona is put to good use — in other films, he's a sort of grizzled good guy; in ""The Maltese Falcon"", he's an anti-hero perhaps as greedy as the men he's trying to dig dirt on. Astor is the ultimate femme fatale, always seductive, always untrustworthy; Lee Patrick, as Spade's faithful secretary, leaves an impression with her adept tactics. Greenstreet and Lorre completely subvert the pitfalls most character actors face, immediately so large in their presences that Bogart and Astor frequently feel like supporting actors.Still more witty, unforgettable, and clever to me is ""The Big Sleep"" — ""The Maltese Falcon"" comes at a close second. While it isn't as labyrinthine as the former, it is much more sordid and embracing of its corrupt patina. There isn't anything like it — few crime films are as convincingly acidic.",The Maltese Falcon
153,faraaj-1,Possibly my favourite film of all time,10,19 April 2006,"This is probably my favourite film (alongwith Amarcord) and certainly my favourite noir. It holds up to repeated viewings and you find something new to appreciate.The reasons that make this one of the greatest (why is it ranked only 53 on IMDb!!!) films of all time are the cast: Bogart defined the untarnished noir hero for future generations and you need to see him in this to understand the reason for his continued cult following.Sydney Greenstreet in his debut film role is stunning as Casper Gutman and his stage trained dialogue delivery is impeccable. Myrna Loy is a sly, crooked, shameless femme fatale ""especially that throb she gets in her throat"". There's the effeminate Peter Lorre, the dangerous Elisha Cook Jr. and the most nominated supporting actress never to win an Oscar Thelma Ritter. Director John Huston took an amazingly insightful decision in not changing the dialogue of the novel. I don't know if that's ever happened before or after in any movie (except those based on a play). The novels dialogues come out far more effective as film dialogue than any scriptwriter could have churned out.I suggest you watch this film a couple of times to understand the plot threadbare. Then watch it a couple of times to understand to appreciate the dialogue and acting. Then watch a couple of dozen times to soak up the atmosphere.....after that you're on your own.....",The Maltese Falcon
154,Artimidor,Stuff that film noir dreams are made of,9,24 August 2012,"John Huston's take on the ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) was already the third adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's novel bearing the same title. Paradoxically it was this third attempt that marked the birth of something new: the genre of film noir. Many would follow in its footsteps repeating the same formula, but it was all here already: The expressionistic black-and-white visual style with its emphasis on the contrast between light and shadow, the elaborate scheme with lots of twists and turns, the cool private eye, the femme fatale - and an ending where the hero doesn't just get the girl and lives happily ever after. The dialogs have edge, are full of irony and black humor, entirely unknown in this capacity in earlier productions. In the center of it all: a certain Humphrey Bogart in his first major role which fits him like a glove, directed by the also debuting John Huston. Starring is furthermore the paradigm of what Hitchcock would call a ""MacGuffin"", a plot device created just for the purpose of driving the action: the titular Maltese Falcon.The film today is often under-appreciated - too many movies imitated, built on or considerably improved its creative new approach. Even the unshakeable, cynic sleuth Bogart with the ""I do what needs to be done"" attitude, the slimy Peter Lorre and the shifty Sydney Greenstreet would play similar roles again and again, and the influence the original had is therefore often overlooked. But make no mistake: The ""Falcon"" for the first time condensed style, great characterization and an intricate multilayered plot into an entertaining detective mystery, set in a world removed from our own that follows its idiosyncratic dark rules. The elusive ""Falcon"" still soars today for those who listen to its call - he's the cinematic pathfinder many others drew from.",The Maltese Falcon
155,JohnWelles,One of the Greatest Movies of All Time.,10,28 February 2009,"John Huston's masterly genre defining film noir, ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). Really, in my opinion its Humphrey Bogart's archetype role, even more so than ""Casablanca"". The acting a treat, especially Peter Lorre (one of my all time favourite actors) and Sydney Greenstreet. The Photography is excellent, and the direction is fabulous by the great John Huston. It's interesting to compare this with the other big debut of that year: Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"". Even if ""Citizen Kane"" is more remembered, ""The Maltese Falcon"" had a much more wider affect than ""Citizen Kane"" did at the time of its release, because ""The Maltese Falcon"" created a genre: Film Noir.",The Maltese Falcon
156,malvernp,What Does This Film Have In Common With The Prisoner Of Zenda?,10,8 December 2020,"The Maltese Falcon (TMF) and The Prisoner Of Zenda (TPOZ) have two things in common with each other:1. Each is represented by the definitive screen adaptation of a classic novel. TMF is most famous for the 1941 version directed by John Huston (his first) starring a memorable cast led by Humphrey Bogart, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Mary Astor and many others. TPOZ is celebrated for the acclaimed Selznick-produced classic featuring Ronald Colman, Madeleine Carroll, Raymond Massey, C. Aubrey Smith and many others.2. Each is represented by a cinematic remake that owes a great deal to an earlier version of the same novel. Huston's creation of TMF was preceded by Roy Del Ruth's 1931 film of the same name starring Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels. A 1952 edition of TPOZ directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr is a scene-by-scene restatement of the Selznick masterpiece except for the absence of the original film's fun, sparkle, wit and charm, stunning black and white photography and amazing cast.Both Huston and Del Ruth were inspired to extensively use the novel as the primary source of TMF's film script.. There would seem to be no question that Huston had seen Del Ruth's prior version, because so much of earlier script reappears in the later film virtually intact. Many scenes and dramatic situations are common to both films. Where they differ significantly is in the subsequent influence of Hays Office censorship, a change in emphasis from sexy to edgy, and revised characterizations caused by major casting changes. Huston also benefitted from having a much more fluid cinematic story-telling style than Del Ruth's, a more creative intelligence in transferring the story from novel into film and that incredibly unique one-of-a-kind cast. These differences resulted in his film breaking new ground in the film noire genre, becoming an instant classic and unleashing Huston on the movie world as a director of the first rank for many years to come.What Huston was able to accomplish in his remake of TMF is truly remarkable. Thorpe's lack of critical success in his effort to revisit Selznick's TPOZ needs no further comment. The difference between the two situations provides a useful illustration about the presence or absence of genius.",The Maltese Falcon
157,stimpy_tr,Like a fast-forward theatre play,5,12 September 2020,"The film looks like it was shortened in order to have more screenings per day. It feels like the script was compressed from a double-sized book to save the budget of filmmaking. About 90 percent of the story takes place in the dialogues and not in the film itself. If you are not a native speaker of American English, you need to read the subtitles very often.+Spoilers from here+
Many plot holes or in better terms, story holes are later filled in by never-ending dialogues. But not everything. I still have not understood how the dead man walked in and did the delivery. Generally, it was like watching a theatre play rather than a movie. By the way, it is not a film-noir, because the unlikeable Spade pulled through so easily after getting rid of everyone. In my opinion, it should not have been that easy. Finally, the only interesting character in the film was that played by Peter Lorre.",The Maltese Falcon
158,patryk-czekaj,A huge noir success,9,14 May 2012,"In The Maltese Falcon the viewer is able to get that eerie noir feeling right from the start. It strings you and doesn't let you move until the very last minute. That's what you would expect from a classic in this genre. It's surprising to say that this is John Huston's first feature film. A real career starter, as it quickly arose to the position of a quintessential entry in its type.It was also a breakthrough performance for Humphrey Bogart. After a few supporting roles and a few niche crime films he finally got a chance to present himself in the most memorable way. He plays Sam Spade, who, along with his partner Miles Archer, operates a detective agency. The boys are on a bit of hiatus, until that one night, when they are approached by a mysterious Mrs. Wonderly (later Brigid O'Shaughnessy). This meeting changes everything – Archer is killed and Sam is left with an enormously puzzling, and murderous, riddle to solve. At this point it's easy to say that Bogart is the true, powerful force that steers the movie on its righteous path. This movie proved, not for the last time, that he was born for roles like this one.And apart from his performance it's crucial to mention other famous personalities that appear in this film. Peter Lorre is great as an overly anxious and ill-tempered Joel Cairo. But even more amazing is Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the greedy mastermind behind the heist. I love how he mixed the character's serious attitude with some of his witty and humorous mockeries. Then there is also Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer Cook, the weak-minded bodyguard and the biggest sissy of all.As for females in this picture, of course the one that plays the biggest part (and presumably the only one worth mentioning) is Mary Astor, who shines as Mrs. O'Shaughnessy. She is the cause of the chaotic turmoil that drew Sam into this foolish game of life-and-death in the endless race for the biggest prize of them allRight now you are probably wondering why I didn't even once mention the titular Maltese Falcon, a bird statue of such tremendous value. People kill others just to put their hands on it. Well, as it comes out, it's basically used in the movie as a film plot device, called MacGuffin (the viewer knows that the object is highly desirable, but he doesn't know why. The narration leaves it open for interpretation). Actually, throughout the movie it is sometimes easy to forget what the whole mess is about. It appears back in the thrilling climax, as we have an opportunity to hear about its history and, finally, get a glimpse of it.'The stuff that dreams are made of.' – utters Sam about the statue at the very end. This simple sentence definitely became one of the most quoted in the history of moving images.Considering the fact that the movie is mostly based on the speaking sequences makes the very clever dialogues even more appealing. And the overly gray atmosphere provides for a true noir experience. The one that will be appreciated by film viewers everywhere for ages. So if you consider broadening your knowledge in this specific genre, you don't want to miss out on watching The Maltese Falcon. Without the use of any special effects, the thrills that it delivers are on the highest possible level.",The Maltese Falcon

163,Geofbob,A portrait of cynicism - in black and (hardly any) white!,10,5 June 2001,"This is the Hollywood film noir par excellence, because it is - well - so black, including of course the fabulous black bird. There is hardly an uncynical line in the movie, and you can be sure that if any character says anything remotely soft they're lying! The whole theme of the film is deceit and manipulation, Everybody is trying to chisel everybody else, so that you have no idea who's on who's side. Is Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) for or against Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet); what was the relationship between Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and dead Thursby; and where does Captain Jacobi (Walter Huston, briefly) fit in?  You can't tell, and it doesn't matter, because the characters change their relationships as casually as they change their underwear. In fact, it could be argued that one of the only honest characters in the movie is the ""gunsel"" Wilmer Cook, played by his namesake Elisha Cook Jr, who is no more and no less than he seems to be - a cheap crook with gaudy patter. And what about Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade; is he the tough, but essentially moral, character, Bogart would play in Casablanca and The Big Sleep; does he behave ethically and honorably? Some postings on IMDb would have you believe so,  but I think that beneath a fairly thin veneer of charm Spade is as cold, venal and self-seeking as the rest. His treatment of ex-lover, Iva Archer (Gladys George), goes beyond hardboiled-ness, and is downright cruel; the alacrity with which he erases his dead partner's name from the office door  is cheap and mean; and does anyone believe him when he says that he will wait 20 years for O'Shaughnessy while she serves her time? (Though, with a good lawyer, she'll probably get off anyway.) In turning in the villains he seems to be acting as a good citizen, but is simply looking after his own interests, as he knows that otherwise the police will probably get him  - in any case, since when has grassing been an honorable profession? The dialogue and acting in the movie are impeccable, with of course Greenstreet as the standout; his achievement is even more impressive when you realise that - after a long stage career - this was his debut movie at the age of 62! As someone else has pointed out, it's a pity that we tend to remember Lorre as Greenstreet's sidekick in this and subsequent films, though Lorre was a major film actor well before this; but this was probably only one of many disappointments in Lorre's career.Perhaps the most successful and satisfying aspect of The Maltese Falcon is its consistency of mood, even if that mood is unremitting in its cynicism.",The Maltese Falcon
164,iantrader,One of the tightest bookie/movie tie-ins ever!,10,13 September 2016,"I doubt there's much anyone can say about this that hasn't already been said. It's sharp, witty, intelligent and a classic! I watched it again while reading the novel in parallel and it's remarkable to see how closely the movie follows the novel. Even most of the dialogue is lifted straight from the book. There are a few omissions but, if anything, they make the movie just a little bit tighter. Hammett was a tight writer in any event and Huston just went with it.Of course, both book and movie have spawned much side chatter, such as whether the villains were homosexual. It's extremely nuanced in the book and only half directly referred to in the film when Brigid slaps Joel's face to cut off an explicit comment. But whether true or not, it has no bearing at all on the story and it seems odd even to mention it. But that's the way it goes when you dissect stories.And, yes, Brigid did sleep with Sam. In the 1940s it was more subtle than today - just a kiss and a fade out...The movie made a star out of Bogard. Greenstreet gives a superb performance and Lorre is on top form.

167,dfloro,First of the great films noir & John Huston movies,8,6 December 2020,"Not only is ""The Maltese Falcon"" one of the first prototypical examples in what would be the subsequent 10 years of great film noir movies, it's also the first movie in the exemplary directing career of John Huston (from the screenplay he adapted from Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade novel). And, even though Bogart had been acting throughout the '30s in mostly supporting roles opposite great actors (like Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, etc.) and actresses (Bette Davis, Ida Lupino, Ann Sheridan, etc.), this role was to make him a bankable star & lead.Like many films in the noir genre, the unnecessarily complicated plot devices are secondary to lighting, mood, tone, and the imperfect cast of characters. It's not as absolutely inscrutable as ""The Big Sleep,"" but more or less tied with ""Out of the Past"" on the hard to follow scale. Mary Astor was an old pro by this time, and she'd said that the motion picture newbie, Sydney Greenstreet, was scared to death during his scenes, though you'd certainly never know it from the result.Huston managed to find a little cameo appearance for his father, Walter Huston as the mysterious Captain Jacoby.

169,Kubris,Didn't click with me,7,23 June 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 103The Maltese Falcon is one of the most famous film noirs, the film that made Humphrey Bogart a star, and an American classic.I have no idea why. Collectively, the Maltese Falcon is not an interesting movie and I frequently found myself trying to stop from nodding off. The story is not interesting: we don't like Miles, so we don't care that he's killed. That short scene with him dying was particularly bad. Miles stands, smiling with a goofy expression at the camera when a gun in first person shoots him, and he doesn't react until he's shot. It's cheesy, and the scene is poor overall. So we never care to learn who killed him. The whole plot is just silly, actually. Sam Spade tries to find a statue with a woman and a couple of bad Bond villains. There's little tension, action, or suspense in the entire movie. It seems the story simply progresses towards a finale that just... happens. Several things are poorly explained, so poorly that I don't know who is responsible for 2 of the murders, why a boat burns, or how Sam acquires a certain package.Speaking of Sam, his acting is one of the few highlights. Not his character though. Humphrey Bogart delivers as the snide main character, but I didn't like him, except for his action at the very end. He's just not a good guy.Another problem is Mary Astor. I learnt, post-viewing, of her wild private life. I wouldn't have known it by seeing the film. She's not a very good liar character, I feel she was horribly miscast. She doesn't have any edge, and she and Bogart have no chemistry.The three villains are similar. None of them are intimidating, except the boy, but he's too stupid or hot-tempered to be dangerous. The other two are just silly.The Maltese Falcon didn't live up to the hype I had for it. It wasn't interesting and had little payoff. In my opinion, it is undeserving of the praises it has received. 7.2/10",The Maltese Falcon
170,dtb,Third Time's the Charm in the 1941 Version of Hammett's Classic,10,24 March 2007,"The classic 1941 version of THE MALTESE FALCON (TMF) was the third movie adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's seminal detective novel about cynical private eye Sam Spade's adventures with the alluring but treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy and other greedy no-goodniks vying for the titular falcon statue. It proves the old adage ""The third time is the charm."" No wonder John Huston's taut, wryly cynical take on Hammett's tale put him on the map as a writer/director. His version has the best of everything in one package: the best private eye thriller, the best Dashiell Hammett movie adaptation, the best remake, and the best nest-of-vipers cast, including the signature Humphrey Bogart role/performance.Huston's powerhouse cast was born to play these characters. Between the perfect performances (even the great Walter Huston is memorable in his brief cameo as the dying Captain Jacobi), Huston's lean, mean pacing and striking visuals (Arthur Edeson's expressionistic photography and Thomas Richards' editing work beautifully), and the overall faithfulness to the novel, it's as if Huston & Company just opened the book and shook it until the characters fell out, then started filming.Humphrey Bogart doesn't match Hammett's description of Sam Spade as a ""blond Satan,"" but he's got Spade's attitude down perfectly, and besides, he's Bogart! What's not to like? Bogie deftly balances toughness, trickiness, and tenderness, but he never lets his tender side make a sap out of him. I find Bogart's Spade sexier than skirt-chasing Ricardo Cortez or Warren William in the previous films because the dames are drawn to Bogie because of his sheer charisma and strength of character, as opposed to him aggressively pitching woo at them until they give in from sheer exhaustion. In an early scene with Brigid, Spade has a line about how all he has to do is stand still and the cops will be swarming all over him; substitute ""women"" for ""cops"" and the line would still be accurate! :-) Mary Astor's real-life shady-lady past informs her spot-on performance as quicksilver Brigid O'Shaughnessy, but it's her watchful eyes, elegance, and that beseeching ""throb in (her) voice"" as she enlists Spade's aid that makes her so fascinating and believable as an avaricious adventuress with a prim, sweet facadea woman who'd kill a guy as soon as kiss him, and keep him guessing about her intentions until the bitter end. That's what made Astor and Bogart such a great team; in their capable hands, Brigid and Spade are two wily, street-smart people who are onto each other as well as into each other.Every actor in TMF shines, from Bogart and Astor to Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as Sgt. Polhaus and Lt. Dundy, to Jerome Cowan as Spade's doomed partner Miles Archer, to Gladys George as clingy, vindictive Iva Archer, to the only cast members who reprised their roles in the otherwise so-so 1975 sequel/spoof THE BLACK BIRD: Elisha Cook Jr. as gunsel Wilmer Cook and Lee Patrick as Spade's trusty secretary Effie Perine. After Spade's tomcatting with Effie and other babes in the early films, it was refreshing that Effie's interest in Spade here is more professional than personal. There's warmth between them, but it stops well short of neck-nuzzling and lap-sitting. :-) Cook has many memorable moments, particularly one brilliant scene where he's on the verge of shooting the cool, calm Spade, his eyes filling with tears of rage as he whispers, ""Get on your feet. I've taken all the riding from you I'm gonna take."" When Wilmer comes to after Spade punches him out, dread and horror spreads over his face as each of the conspirators stares at him coldly (another triumph of editing and photography), and he realizes he's being set up as their fall guy. You can almost hear Wilmer frantically thinking, ""Oh, s***!!!"" Still, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre come closest to stealing the show. As Kasper Gutman, Greenstreet blends menace with avuncularity, his voice a cultured growl. Greenstreet's performance is so assured, it's hard to believe TMF was this veteran stage actor's first movie job, but it's easy to see why he earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. TMF made Greenstreet an in-demand character actor and one of cinema's most memorable villains, especially in his team-ups with Peter Lorre. Lorre's witty, sly performance as the smoothly effeminate yet ruthless weasel Joel Cairo is a marvelous addition to the rogues' gallery of lowlifes Lorre played over the course of his long career. After TMF's success, the great cast worked together in various combinations in many movies, including CASABLANCA. I've always wondered what a TMF caper film sequel following Gutman and Cairo to Istanbul would've been like, considering Greenstreet and Cairo's antihero buddy chemistry.TMF has so much memorable dialogue, often laced with sardonic humor, that I'd be virtually transcribing the whole script if I quoted all my fave lines. In my family, ""The cheaper the crook, the gaudier the patter"" and ""When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it"" have often been jokingly quoted. Then there's Gutman's deliciously ironic toast with Spade: ""Here's to plain speaking and clear understanding."" Plain speaking and clear understanding with this band of greedy, duplicitous cutthroats?! Good luck! :-) But the talk's a joy to listen to; as Gutman says, ""I distrust a closed-mouthed man. He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says all the wrong things. Talking is something you can't do judiciously unless you keep in practice."" TMF has one of cinema's greatest last lines, Spade's answer when Polhaus asks what the statue is: ""The stuff that dreams are made of."" I also love the climactic scene with all the principal players, especially the dialogue between Spade and Gutman about how to go about getting what they want (""...If you kill me, how are you gonna get the bird? And if I know you can't afford to kill me, how are you gonna scare me into giving it to you?..."") Truly, TMF is ""The stuff that dreams are made of""!",The Maltese Falcon
171,StevenKeys,The Maltese Falcon,9,3 December 2020,"A centuries long quest for the Templar's jewel-laden treasure arrives in San Francisco, bringing with it the constant companions in murder, deceit, obsession, greed and lust.Noir to the teeth, or the brim, as it were. First clue, Spade: ""I won't play the sap!"" Sam's a hero and that's a noir necessity. Second is Brigid (Ruth). Only Trevor (Helen) in Murder-My-Sweet (44) can keep pace with the doe-eyed but deadly Mary Astor. She's pretty, she's duplicitous, she's feisty (See; Joel Cairo .. Ouch!) and she wants to try love on for size. And ""there's the rub,"" as the Prince of Denmark would say, letting her guard down in dream of ditching her habit of singular self-interest. Just try to change your stripes and you'll end up wearing 'em, State-issue. But that is sentiment and that is hope and that is the biggest rub of all in noir. To borrow Pop Scorsese's recipe (Goodfellas), hope is pork in the gravy (""That's the flavor!""). Without a light at tunnel's end, reached or not, it's just another CD with a morality motif (Crime never pays!).The one flaw: Iva Archer (George), the whining, two-timing widow of Spade's unlucky partner, Miles (Cowan). A fine actress and sometimes leading lady (The-Roaring-Twenties) (39), Gladys' character is an awkward part in an otherwise top production (4/4). Keep in mind, as great a filmography as John Huston would compile over his career (The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre The-African-Queen The-Night-of-the-Iguana Chinatown {actor}), Maltese was his first time in the director's chair. Maybe this will help: think of it (the flaw) like those Moroccan rugs, where one stitch is intentionally mis-woven under the theory that only God can be perfect. Yet, because of this weird weave that makes Sam's closing claim to Miss O'Shaughnessy of a partner code appear the height of hypocrisy, I give the nod to Dick Powell's Phillip Marlowe in said Murder-My-Sweet over Spade as the best private-eye on film: more trustworthy.A knotty-noir, though not as complicated as some (The-Big-Sleep Bullitt), based on the Dashiell Hammett novel and 1931 Del Ruth original. If the actions of players appear at times unexpected (Spade accepts a drink from the suspicious Gutman), consider, the noir figure is a calculating risk-taker, otherwise they'd be working nites at the A&P. Besides that, you've just gotta' break some dialogue eggs to make a movie omelet, i.e., the exactitude of realism, nearly a decade away, can be a poor plot mover.Not a true spoiler, I do foresee this about the film's two biggest characters, so splendidly played by the recurring Warner Bros film firm of Greenstreet & Lorre: it is Cairo's harsh rebuke of Gutman (""You imbecile!!"") that triggers Kasper's TIA (mini-stroke) which should make him easy for the bulls to pinch, if woebegone Wilmer doesn't put a pill in him first. And Cairo? He's friends in Frisco and will slither & yon past the coppers.As for the man originally cast as Sam Spade, filming scenes in early production until he decided it was not for him, I've written a little poem in honor of the great George Raft and all of humanity's bad calls: I've no regret, for leaving the set, as John-Boy was green, so how could I've seen, Spade would be bigger than Rhett!I call TMF noir because today you must if a crime-drama is to get stamp-of-approval (noirgesse). But I wonder if a Star as big as Bogart, or Joan as Pierce, can create the uncertain mood that noir requires? Do you ever think that Sam or Mildred won't, in the end, land on their feet? We live vicariously through these characters and if I'm Sam Spade I will not believe that I won't come out on top. This is not about quality of film as Maltese is first-class entertainment, but rather, our obsession today with labels.",The Maltese Falcon
172,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Humphrey Bogart makes his highly deserved tryst with super-stardom in John Huston's directorial debut,10,25 July 2011,"Seven decades have passed but the suspense and thrill of The Maltese Falcon still reign supreme. The movie, despite being in black & white, appears strikingly refreshing both to the eyes and the intellect. Primarily remembered as John Huston's directorial debut, the movie played a decisive role in giving Film-Noire its true identity as a genre. The Maltese Falcon also gave Humphrey Bogart his highly deserved super-stardom that had hitherto eluded him. Huston creates an environment of suspicion, doubt and uncertainty that is so convoluted that even Hitchcock would be proud of it. The movie has multiple layers of mystery and suspense that keeps the viewer engaged throughout. Sam Spade is a private detective who runs an agency with his partner Miles Archer. An ostensibly naive lady, Miss Wanderly offers them a task to pursue a man, Floyd Thursby, who has allegedly run off with her younger sister. The over-simplicity of task arouses Spade's suspicion, but Wanderly's lucrative offer makes the duo overlook it initially. Miles is killed during the pursuit and the police inform Spade of the mishap. Spade only discreetly tells the police that Miles was after a man named Thursby without disclosing anything about Miss Wandely. The police soon find Thursby dead as well and suspect Spade for killing him in an act of revenge. Soon Miles Archer's widow shows up at Spade's office and insinuates of her romantic involvement with Spade, who shuns her away after she tries to incriminate him for the murder. The police come across an anonymous lead and begin suspecting Spade for killing his partner, Miles. The plot thickens with the entry a couple of obscure characters including Joel Cairo, who happens be an acquaintance of Miss Wanderly. He is in pursuit of a highly precious, antique, gold statuette of Maltese Falcon and offers Spade five grands to help him find it. A game of cat and mouse soon ensues, between the various stake holders, which becomes deadlier as the stakes are raised. Humphrey Bogart perfectly fits into the shoes of Spade—a sleek and sharp sleuth—and makes it his own in a manner that only someone of his grit and caliber could. Bogart is in top form right from the inception to the finale, stealing the spotlight in almost every scene that is he is part of. Bogart could only demonstrate his prodigious talent and acting prowess in short bursts during his long ""B movie"" stint in which he was mostly type-casted as a gangster. The Maltese Falcon was Bogart's big break after years of anticipation and he didn't leave a single stone unturned to prove his mettle. Bogart shows his class and stamps his authority as a performer during the portrayal of Spade: he is ever so quick-witted thanks to his sublime articulacy and his prowess at repartee seems unparalleled; the inherent cynicism in Spade and the perspicacity with which he operates soon became Bogart's trademark and catapulted him to super-stardom. Many regard Bogart's performance in Casablanca as his absolute best, but I rate his portrayal of Spade second only to his supernal portrayal of Dobbs in The Treasure of Sierre Madre, where he took acting to hitherto unattainable and unforeseeable heights. John Huston uses the Midas touch he had as a screenwriter to strike all the right cords in his directorial debut. Almost everyone in the supporting cast gives a memorable performance with special mention of Peter Lorre as the deceptive Joel Cairo, Sydney Greenstreet as the witty yet dangerous Kasper Gutman and Mary Astor as the scheming Brigid O' Shaughnessy. The taut plot of the movie, which is masterfully adapted from the novel of the same name by Huston himself, is well complemented by the impressively written dialogs that are delivered with an equal prowess. Amidst the everlasting suspense the movie has an obvious undertone of dark humor that adds great value to the movie. The cinematography undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the time.The Maltese Falcon is not merely a Noire masterpiece but also a testament to the true spirit of cinema that has kept itself alive despite decades of relentless mutilation and sabotage in the name of commercial movie-making. Despite being devoid of modern-day gimmicks the movie is incredibly high on suspense and holds the viewer in a vice-like grip throughout its runtime. It's a real shame that movies like these are seldom made these days. The tone of the movie is such that it makes suspense thrillers of today appear like kids cartoon. PS. The movie is an ode to Bogart, Huston and all those who made it a reality. It's suspense cinema at its absolute best with a completely different treatment to themes propagated by the likes of Hitchcock. It's a must for all the Bogart fans worldwide, and absolutely essential for all those who have a penchant for Film-Noire as a genre. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",The Maltese Falcon

The characters are unlikable and the actors speak ontop of each other saying their memorized lines too quickly as if they just want to get through the performance. Mary Astor is pretentious and overdramatic while Boggie comes across as a caricature. There is a very weak plot and little suspense or action in this film noir. The characters just shuffle back and forth between the PI's office, a hotel, and the PI's home. Everyone is lying, threatening, and bribing each other while trying to gain possession of an expensive statue of a falcon. The film is a mess! There are many plot holes and ludicrous scenes of characters pulling guns and childishly smacking each other. It's actually laughable at times. To make matters worse, the two leads have no chemistry and there is no character development which makes the love story a complete joke. Honestly, except for getting to cross this off my movie bucket list, it's barely worth the time IMHO! (I read that the 1931 original is much better) 3/2021.",The Maltese Falcon
174,kylehodgdon,This Is The Stuff That Great Movies Are Made Of.,8,5 March 2010,"Being born in 1983, ""The Maltese Falcon"" proves to be a tricky movie to review. Obviously the movie is great, but I find it tough to review because is was so monumental at the time (and still to this day) and changed how many movies are made. Since I was not around in 1941, I could not experience the grandeur of ""The Maltese Falcon"" when it initially hit the scene. Beyond the cultural impact of this movie, I like it because there is a very interesting plot surrounding a very mysterious object. I continually give these types of mystery-thrillers positive reviews and this movie may very well be one of the best. The ending of this movie really makes you look back at everything that transpired and really makes you think of the movie as a whole in a very different light. On the surface it is just about some greedy people trying to obtain something very valuable. If we look deeper, it shows human ambition and the chasing of a dream. Beyond the wonderful story that this movie tells, ""The Maltese Falcon"" hits a home run with the acting, characters, set, and lighting. ""The Maltese Falcon"" is definitely a must see.",The Maltese Falcon
175,gcrokus,Properly One Of AFI's All-TimeTop Films,10,25 April 2009,"I don't know where exactly ""The Maltese Falcon"" falls on the AFI Top 100 films list – wait, let me look – ah, number 23, down a few notches since the original list was published in 1997 – but it is truly one of the great films. There are few films that whip out dialogue like this one.Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan, in his most famous role) are approached by one Miss Wanderly (Mary Astor) to place a tail on a fellow named Floyd Thursby. It is only later that night that Spade is informed of Archer's murder while following Thursby (we find out that Thursby himself had also been killed). Within a short period Spade meets Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a very cool customer - a shady one at that - has several meetings with Miss Wanderly and deals with Archer's widow (with whom Spade has obviously had an affair). It also follows that the police are leaning on Spade for the crimes committed.Eventually we learn that Cairo has some relationship with a character named Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet in the role of a lifetime) and that all the parties Spade is dealing with are in some manner interested in the whereabouts of a figurine called The Maltese Falcon. This would be a great example of Hitchcock's MacGuffin device.In true film noir fashion, we are never sure of the motivations of any of the characters. No one appears to be what they say they are, including Miss Wanderly. I know of no murder, or any other crime, for that matter, that was solved by a detective in my lifetime. But here ""The Maltese Falcon"" delivers a theme that has been the fodder for literally countless murder mysteries – books, films, radio and TV.You will hard pressed to find a single movie script that more closely follows the original novel. The dialogue is almost verbatim. At one point in the book Spade goes to John's Grill and has chops. It isn't on the menu anymore, but the restaurant still is a going concern in downtown San Francisco, the setting of this story. That isn't in the movie.For sheer gritty dialogue, terrific casting and a real mystery to boot you would be well served to make this an addition to your movie studies. It is a true classic. ""Citizen Kane"" is always touted as film with no flaws; ""The Maltese Falcon"" has some tiny errors unearthed by students of film (validating this film's importance, of course), but none of them materially affect the movie. Just sit back and watch it unfold.Four stars.",The Maltese Falcon
176,SeminolePhenom,The first and greatest of John Huston setting forth the film noir we know and love...,10,17 September 2005,"Sam Spade(Humphry Bogart) is a private investigator who gets caught up with others who are obsessed with ""the Maltese falcon"" after his partner is killed after taking a case. The cast also includes Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet.As said in my summary, this is the first film directed by John Huston and is considered by many to be the first sign of the film-noir era. It was said that Humphry Bogart was not their first choice as Sam Spade but I can't see anyone else playing the role like he did. Once again, just as in Casablanca, Bogart's acting supplemented for the rest of the cast's acting. Although we do see good performances from Greenstreet and Lorre(Who also starred in Casablanca with Bogart), Mary Astor gave a poor performance as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, which hurt the chemistry between Bogart and her. What people tend to forget about this movie is that it was made in 1941 and I found it very good for the types of movies that came out during that time period, but the movie is slightly overrated when compared to others from then on to the fifties. Overall, the movie was a stellar movie with a few flaws but yet still very entertaining.I highly recommend this movie.",The Maltese Falcon
177,jwpeel-1,THE definitive Dashiell Hammett Sam Spade movie!,10,5 August 2006,"Now. listen closely people. This is one of the best remakes ever made. It makes you forget there was any other version. After Warner's did the first version (with Ricardo Cortez, Bebe Daniels, Dudley Digges and Dwight Frye whose title is ""Damgerous Female"" so as not to confuse TV viewers) They decided to make it into an ill-fitting comedy called ""Satan Met A Lady' with contract players Warren Williams and Bette Davis, changing the Fat MAN to a Fat WOMAN (Allison Skipworth) and the result is horrendous. So along comes this new young guy and son of a then legendary actor Walter Huston gets a chance to direct his first film for the studio and they figure, ""Okay. We already own the rights to the Hammett book and we've done it twice now. Let the kid try his hand at a remake and see what he can do."" So Huston gets a top notch cast with Bogie, Greenstreet, Lorre, Mary Astor and Elisha Cooke Jr. and turns out a fabulous film with sharp dialogue right from the book, a PERFECT cast and despite what some other reviewers have said, the 1931 version is at best a rough draft and run through before the masterpiece that is THIS version. The black bird never looked so good or deadly.The chemistry alone is worth watching. This is the gold standard of the private eye and the film noir genre.And this comes from a guy who lives for good detective films.",The Maltese Falcon
178,joshuafagan-64214,"One of the First Noirs, One of the Best Noirs",10,8 September 2015,"Fun fact: the Huston family has seen three generations of Academy Award winners. Even considering that, like American political 'dynasties,' there is no shortage of acting dynasties, such is an impressive feat. Nepotism can take you far, but only so far. You need talent. And this family had it. Onto the review.It's amazing how many people think that adapting books into movies is a new idea. Yes, one could argue that adapting the most popular books out there purely for the name value is new, but originality has never been one of Hollywood's strong suits. They are and always have been an enterprise, after all. Even when they didn't have to sell movies that were made for nine digits to a worldwide audience, they still wanted to line their pockets. You think that all those old Hollywood mansions built the Golden Age of Cinema were paid for by people who wanted to see only the most esoteric fare?After all this grand posturing, you may think that The Maltese Falcon was based on a book. And you would be right. I rarely hold back surprises. It was a fine book, written in 1929 by Dashiell Hammett. But its being forgotten or, at best, being known as just a shadow of the movie is not entirely insensible. Though I am a writer by nature, I verily say that a fine, well-paced novel does not hold a candle to a film that created a new genre.I am, of course, talking about film noir. It is one of my favorite genres of all time. Even works that parody it are automatically more likely to catch my eye. It is to me what Star Wars lightsabres are to many fanboys: a surefire way to catch my attention. It combines some of some of my favorite cinematic elements: stylistic darkness, an earned and not-dreary drizzling of cynicism, opening narrations, and so forth. Thankfully, I'm not the only one. Otherwise, we wouldn't have neo-noir films. I even like its name. Noir. Say it a few times and feel how good it sounds coming off your tongue. It means 'black' in French. And one should really use that whole sentence when saying such. Do not leave off the 'in French' part. Because noir movies are not just 'black'; they are black in a traditionally French way. There is no other genre where the name so informationally and stylistically fits the movies it entails.If nothing else, this movie is in my top one hundred films of all time merely because it both created the genre and is one of the best examples of it. You are not just invested in Sam Spade as he investigates, you are invested in him in a way that people at the time had never seen before. Of course, if you don't watch older movies, you may never have seen a film like this either.It pulls you into its climate, but it does not do so by overwhelming you with so much art and radiance that your mind has no choice but to be absorbed in it, like is the case with many great animated films (and the Mad Max movies). Nor does it do so by spiraling you down into a castle that seems to bend space and time, augmenting the fabric of reality itself, as is the case with many great Nolan and Kubrick films. No; it greets you with a crispy, worn, learned hand and asks you firmly to come along with it. Though it is perhaps based less in reality than even Nolan and Kubrick films, it makes you feel like you're in the truest sort of reality, like all the dark, most 'real' parts of reality have been smashed into one film.You may have noticed that I have not talked at all about the plot and characters. This is not because they are irrelevant or simple, because they are not. You can tell that this is an adaptation of a novel; after you've written for a while, you learn to recognize the fingerprints of a novelist anywhere you go. It is complex and multi-layered and not too concerned with making us go to bed with visions of sugarplums in our heads. But the tone and style of the film are so closely intertwined with the screenplay that it seems as if they are one. If I wanted to pick and choose only story elements, it would be like trying to pull red bands out of snakeskin....I'm not making a very good case for myself, am I?So be it. I will spare at least a paragraph to say that there is not a bad performance in the movie. Mary Astor as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Gladys George as Iva Archer, and Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo are great. And Bogart is well... Bogart. In the AFI's poll of the greatest actors, he ended up first, ahead of Brando. That's about right. Brando is a better actor. But Bogart is everything a movie star should be. There's a reason that I encountered many references to him before I was even old enough to know who he is.This is a movie that I cannot recommend enough. No matter how eloquent I am, my words are, to some extent, futile. You have to see this movie to know full of what i am talking. If you have not seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it once, see it again. If you have seen it 37 times, watch it a thirty-eighth. Just watch it. It's... the stuff dreams are made of.",The Maltese Falcon
179,alexdeleonfilm,A shaggy dog story with feathers and Humphrey Bogart,6,6 February 2017,"image1.jpeg A private detective takes on a case that involves him with three eccentric criminals, a gorgeous (?) liar, and their quest for a priceless statuette. Caught on Late night Hungarian TV, February 2017. The Maltese Falcon, 1941, was the directing debut of John Huston and the career breakthrough role of Humphrey Bogart, then Himself 41. Until then Bogey had played a string of notorious criminals and unsavory bad guys in gangster pix and always got killed at the end. In Falcon he comes into his own as a the cynical cool cucumber on the right side of the law, or almost, that we we will remember him as forever after. This particular film has some remarkable moments, some fine B/w photography, and some terrific characters; Besides Bogey, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet (if anything, even cooler than Bogart) and the best mousy punk ever, Elisha Cook. Jr. but it is basically a B detective story that has been enormously overrated and praised to high heaven by reverse intello-critics who have even convinced a legion of critical camp followers that this is ""one of the greatest movies of all time"".First of all, it is not the first ""film noir"" as some apologists have claimed nor is it by any stretch of the imagination the greatest movie of all time. It is not even a film noir by the usual standards of that genre nor is it a great script as others have claimed, It's a very muddled script that is carried along by some fabulous characters and whose numerous potholes are slicked over by some very smooth dialogue. The main figures are very well drawn but the story about a chase after a valuable stuffed bird is more of a red herring than a black bird of prey. The major weak point of the picture, however, is the insipidness of the anti-heroine played by unsexy plain looking actress Mary Astor for whom hard boiled detective Sam Spade (Bogart ) is supposed to have the hots throughout and even slips her a few half hearted kisses at times, but then realizing she is an unscrupulous murderess has to turn her into the cops who have been bugging him all along. (Ward Bond was one of them).For all its weaknesses and credibility gaps just watching Bogart evolve in this picture from a crass villain to a leading superstar in one easy lesson, and especially the finely crafted scenes between himself and Bulky silky middle aged actor Sidney Greenstreet (who should have gotten co-star billing) elevate this ordinary programmer to the realm of high entertainment. But let us not get carried away -- high entertainment is not the same as High Art. This is not the Greatest Story Ever Told on screen... Casablance, which followed the next year, again with Bogart, Lorre and Greenstreet, but a different director and this time with a most attractive leading lady -- an actress by the name of Ingrid Bergman -- was a much better movie, and definitely in the realm of cinema art even though it too was originally intended to be mass entertainment. There comes a point where the distinction between extraordinary craftsmanship and artistry melts away. Director Michael Curtiz was such a perfect craftsman that that he became an artist without even trying. John Huston was a very good craftsman, but the craftsmanship always showed. Aside from everything else what makes Maltese Falcon is the personalities of the main players. I didn't think it was an exceptionally good movie when I saw it as an uncritical kid eons ago. Decades later as a critical adult my original impression hasn't changed much. Two stars for the story. Four stars for the actors. Six Stars total -- and that's being kind of generous..",The Maltese Falcon

Bond's performance is...I'm just jerkin' your chain! Yeah, Ward Bond acts in the most AFI films and he does play a cop here, but Humphrey Bogart is the story. This was Bogie's big breakout (along with High Sierra that same year) and he lights it up. The man paid his dues for a while and played the heavy in 1930s films before they finally gave him the chance to be a leading man. Interesting that he often played shady ""heroes""---including in The Maltese Falcon---rather than being straight-up nice-nice.Bogie's Sam Spade sees his partner get killed and he gains (and then loses) a love interest all in what seems like a few days. He also comes one phony statue shy of being a rich man. They all want that bird. Crooks all. Each of the villains in this piece is memorable: Sydney Greenstreet (debutting as Kasper Gutman), Peter Lorre (slimy and fey), Elisha Cook (weird, as always) and Mary Astor (constantly on the verge of hysteria or passing out).The last half-hour is tense, yet it's just 5 people waiting around in a room.

183,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,"""The stuff that dreams are made of""",8,24 November 2014,"Among the movies we not only love but treasure, ""The Maltese Falcon"" stands as one of those films. Consider what was true after its release in 1941 and was not true before:(1) The movie defined Humphrey Bogart's performances for the rest of his life; his hard-boiled Sam Spade rescued him from a decade of middling roles in B gangster movies and positioned him for ""Casablanca,"" ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" ""The African Queen"" and his other classics. (2) It was the first film directed by John Huston, who for more than 40 years would be a prolific maker of movies that were muscular, stylish and daring. (3) It contained the first screen appearance of Sydney Greenstreet, who went on, in ""Casablanca"" and many other films, to become one of the most striking character actors in movie history. (4) It was the first pairing of Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, and so well did they work together that they made nine other movies, including ""Casablanca"" in 1942 and ""The Mask of Dimitrios"" (1944), in which they were not supporting actors but actually the stars. (5) And some film histories consider ""The Maltese Falcon"" the first film noir.The moment that sticks out for me comes near the end, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) has been collared for murdering Spade's partner. She says she loves Spade. She asks if Sam loves her. She pleads for him to spare her from the law. And he replies, in a speech some people can quote by heart, ""I hope they don't hang you, precious, by that sweet neck. . . . The chances are you'll get off with life. That means if you're a good girl, you'll be out in 20 years. I'll be waiting for you. If they hang you, I'll always remember you.""Spade is cold and hard, like his name. When he gets the news that his partner has been murdered, he doesn't blink an eye. Didn't like the guy. Kisses his widow the moment they're alone together. Beats up Joel Cairo (Lorre), loses patience with Greenstreet, throws his cigar into the fire, smashes his glass, barks out a threat, slams the door and then grins to himself in the hallway, amused by his own act.If he didn't like his partner, Spade nevertheless observes a sort of code involving his death. ""When a man's partner is killed,"" he tells Brigid, ""he's supposed to do something about it."" He doesn't like the cops, either; the only person he really seems to like is his secretary, Effie (Lee Patrick), who sits on his desk, lights his cigarettes, knows his sins and accepts them. How does Bogart make a character get away with making such a dark guy the hero of a film? Because he does his job according to the rules he lives by, and because we sense (as we always would with Bogart after this role) that the toughness conceals old wounds and broken dreams.The plot is the last thing you think of about. The Maltese Falcon is a black bird (said to be made of gold and encrusted with jewels) has been stolen, men have been killed for it, and now Gutman (Greenstreet) has arrived with his lackeys (Lorre and Elisha Cook Jr.) to get it back. Spade gets involved because the Mary Astor character hires him to--but the plot goes around and around, and eventually we realize that the black bird is an example of Hitchcock's ""MacGuffin""--it doesn't matter what it is, so long as everyone in the story wants or fears it.To describe the plot in a linear and logical fashion is almost impossible. That doesn't matter. The movie is essentially a series of conversations punctuated by brief, violent interludes. It's all style. It isn't violence or chases, but the way the actors look, move, speak and embody their characters. Under the style is attitude: Hard men, in a hard season, in a society emerging from Depression and heading for war, are motivated by greed and capable of murder. For an hourly fee, Sam Spade will negotiate this terrain. Everything there is to know about Sam Spade is contained in the scene where Bridget asks for his help and he criticizes her performance: ""You're good. It's chiefly your eyes, I think--and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like, 'be generous, Mr. Spade.'""",The Maltese Falcon

Happily, it created a memorable persona for Humphrey Bogart, prolonging his sex appeal even as his once-beautiful face collapsed into prunedom, and gave Mary Astor a last shot at glamor before giving it up as Judy Garland's ketchup-making mother in ""Meet Me In St. Louis."" The only actor who really lost out on ""Maltese Falcon"" was poor Peter Lorre.

The story of ""The Maltese Falcon"" is the one of Sam Spade solving the murder of his partner. It's an excellently crafted story and one which obeys the basic rules of mystery in that it gives the viewer all of the information available to the detective who solves it (or nearly all of it).When we see Miles Archer being shot, he is standing calmly with his hands in his pockets. He seems surprised as a gun is raised by an unseen assailant to shoot him, but not alarmed or afraid. At the scene of the crime, the police inform Spade that Archer has his gun tucked away in his hip and his overcoat buttoned. Spade informs the police that Archer had been tailing a guy named Thursby. Later, when Thursby is found shot, the police suggest that Spade had the motivation to kill a guy who had murdered his partner, but Spade does not respond. He only states that he has never seen Thursby, dead or alive. The only vital piece of information we haven't been given is Spade's opinion that ""Mile's hadn't many brains, but he'd had too many years of experience as a detective to be caught like that...""At this point the movie goes off on the Falcon sub-plot, completely taking our mind off of the Archer murder. Spade has never said anything to suggest that he believes Thursby to be the murderer, but we, and the police, fill in that detail for ourselves. We forget about it and move on. It isn't until the final scene that this main plot of the movie re-emerges and we realize that solving the murder of his partner was Spade's motivation all along. ""When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it."" If there is any flaw in this nearly perfect film, it's that the Falcon diversion is so effective that we still leave the movie not fully realizing what the story was actually about.",The Maltese Falcon

It holds up to repeated viewings almost 60 years after its initial release.Bogey, in his breakthrough role, is terrific as Sam Spade. The rest of the cast is flawless. Mary Astor is sexy and mysterious as the femme fatale, Peter Lorre as the somewhat fopish Joel Cairo and Sydney Greenstreet as Casper Gutman almost steal the picture. Elisha Cook Jr. as Wilmer and Barton MacLane and Ward Bond as the cops, also stand out.John Huston, who wrote the screenplay and directed the picture, showed  off his considerable talent to advantage in this his first major film. His father, Walter also does as nice turn in a cameo as Captain Jacobi.The plot has so many twists and turns and double crosses that it is difficult at times to tell who is helping who in the quest for the falcon. It is also of interest to note that very little violence takes place on camera. Most of the action in the story takes place off-screen.There's a great exchange of dialogue between Bogey and Mary Astor near the end when he figures out that she had killed his partner and as a result, she was ""taking the fall"".A truly great film - the stuff that dreams are made of.",The Maltese Falcon

189,shhimundercoverdamnit,The Maltese Falcon ( 1941),9,1 November 2006,""" You. Uh You aren't exactly the sort of person you pretend to be are you?"" A gallery of high-living lowlifes will stop at nothing to get their sweaty hands on a jewel-encrusted falcon. Private Detective Sam Spade ( Humphrey Bogart) wants to find out why-and who'll take the fall for his partner's murder. An all star cast including Sydney Greenstreet, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr. join Bogart in this crackling mystery masterwork written for the screen from the Hammett novel and directed by John Huston.The Maltese Falcon is more than just a simple detective story. It's a movie about human characters. And it deals with several themes over and over again: love, truth, lies, greed, lust to name a few. There are really no good guys to speak of. Spade himself, isn't exactly a decent guy as well. For one, his morals are portrayed to be lax. For example, it is revealed that he was having an affair with his dead partners wife, and there is more than one time where he mentions that he is in it ' for himself.' But Bogart is Sam Spade. There is a real force to his performance.. An almost fierce animal like presence. The thing I love about Bogart is that in one scene he can scare the living crap out of you and in the next he would go all puppy eyed on you! Sidney Greenstreet's is beyond brilliant. His use of facial expressions and the way he delivers his dialogue is unbelievable. Most of the film, he is just sitting there, and yet he manages to capture so much. Remarkably, this was also his first on-screen appearance.Peter Lorre, is his usual creepy self, the way he almost whispers his dialogue is just insane. I also believe he is playing a homosexual, as his character is really prissy. For example, in one scene Spade smacks him in the face and say to him, "" When your slapped in the face, you'll take it and like it."" The only problem I had with the film was Mary Astor. I just found her ridiculous, I'm sorry. But, I didn't buy her 'act' for a second, and I found a lack of chemistry between her and Bogart, as well. I think there were a lot of better actresses who could have played a better Brigid O'Shaughnessy. I'm a big Gene Tierney fan. Oh well, that is my only grape about the movie.",The Maltese Falcon

192,ks4,"Classic film-Noir, mysterious and interesting, but fails to deliver a solid climax.",6,23 May 2004,"The Maltese FalconSam Space is a private detective, one day a mysterious woman comes to see her, she wants a man shadowed. Sam's partner does the job and gets killed, by who, is unknown. While investigating the murder he finds himself getting involved with dangerous men, seeking the myth of a Maltese Falcon statue, so valueable, they're willing to do anything it takes to get it.This movie is most of the way a real original film-noir, where our head character and supposed good guy finds himself getting involved in something larger and more dangerous than he should be able to handle. Although whether Humprey Bogart is playing that good a guy in his character, Sam Spade, can be discussed, Sam Spade is portrayed as a sort of egocentric partly greedy man, who is obviously supposed to be our hero, but on his journey we see greedy and often cynic and egocentric sides of him. The strength of this movie is the constant curiousity we have for how the story will unfold, there is always a mysterious look for the story, and it feels interesting because it is this detective story where we are participating in slowly unfolding the mystery. However, the movie has quite a few plot holes, and the many fast paced match cuts doesn't give us much time to think deeper into what's happening, everything is really going too fast, something that also means the atmosphere in the movie feels pretty non existant and my interest were never gathered 100%. The acting in the movie is actually quite great, especially for this old a movie. In older movies I often think that the acting seems to many of the actors to be awkvard, but not in this movie, in this movie it's quite convincing, despite a few flaws, flaws though that is a part of giving this movie the charming oldies feel.To sum it all up a bit. The movie, despite having quite a number of flaws, is overall an interesting experience, that will leave you guessing and hold your interest for most of the time, even though it has its drop downs, it's still a pretty well done mystery story, following the classic film-noir model much of the way. However despite having a good story, that unfolds good, but too fast, the movie never really managed to impress me with the climax, actually i felt the climax never reached the heights it should have. Something that leaves an overall less convincing opinion upon the movie, especially a murdery story like this, which is highly dependant on a good climax.6/10",The Maltese Falcon
193,schubej-1,A Classic with Shortcomings,7,29 June 2020,"Of all the Humphrey Bogart films this was one of his better films but failed to measure up to Casablanca and The African Queen. As much as I liked John Huston films, this film was a little presumptuous in its development. Sam Spade (Humphrey) takes on a case from a woman (Mary Astor) and he later tells her he didn't believe her story and she admits to lying and even says she's tired of all the lying. Regardless, Spade and Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor) become romantically involved. Spade's associate/partner is murdered and he acts indifferently about it. As much as the mystery aspect is well done there are inconsistencies with the criminals' actions. Also, actors were apparently directed to ""overact"" at times to make the scene more intense and when this occurred with Spade it seemed to be out of character since otherwise he was totally in control of his emotions. Sydney Greenstreet as one of the criminals was subtlety brilliant in his role. A young Peter Lorre, as an associate to Greenstreet, was threatening with his looks but had virtually no lines (possibly because he was not yet that familiar with English). In any event, the movie as a whole is entertaining even with its shortcomings.",The Maltese Falcon

195,Supachewy,One of the Greatest Noirs Ever,8,19 October 2010,"The noir The Maltese Falcon is directed by John Huston and stars Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor. The film takes place in 1941 San Francisco.The film starts out with a woman (Astor) going to the detective agency Spade and Archer to find out where her sister is located because she has been off with a violent man, Thursby. Later that night Archer is found dead after being shot. Then it is discovered that Thursby has been shot and killed as well. Sam Spade (Bogart) has to find out who killed his partner and what the reason it is that the person has done so. But then someone proposes to him a job where he must find a prized object, the Maltese falcon, for a large sum of money. While searching for this falcon he realizes that this prized object may have a connection to all the murders...The screenplay by John Huston was wonderful, he truly wrote one of the greatest film noirs of all time. The plot has many twists and turns and it is impossible to know which characters to trust and which are the good guys. It kept me wondering the whole time and the conclusion is very satisfying. Huston wrote an iconic character, Sam Spade, who spewed such brilliant dialogue, being that it was had so much wit.Huston's direction for the film was as well great. He set up what a great noir should be to all the noirs that followed. There were many brilliant shots throughout the film, one sequence in particular that comes to mind is when the character Wilmer Cook woke up how each character stared at him going from close up to close up. Along with the great shots Huston got great performances from his whole cast.The acting in this film was terrific. Humphrey Bogart gave a brilliant performance as always, comparable to his performance in Casablanca, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and The African Queen. Bogart spewed all his brilliant dialogue perfectly with such great facial expressions to go along with it. When people talk about great actors Bogart is always mentioned, this film has to be seen to know why. Mary Astor was very good as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the whole time it was unclear whether or not she could be trusted. Peter Lorre gave a shining performance as Joel Cairo as well, always somewhat nervous yet wanted to be in control even though he never was. All the other supporting performances were fine as well.Overall I give this film an 8/10, usually I am not a fan of the noir genre but I feel this one is very good because of Bogart's fantastic performance and Huston's spectacular script and direction. I did feel romance was a little bit forced in this one, but I can excuse it. This film is recommended to anyone who likes noirs or Humphrey Bogart.",The Maltese Falcon
196,tsf-1962,the stuff that dreams are made of,10,25 November 2006,"It's rare when you can pinpoint a single film as marking the start of a new genre, but ""The Maltese Falcon"" made history as the first and best film noir. This film is groundbreaking in so many ways: as John Huston's directorial debut; as Humphrey Bogart's first heroic role; and as the great Sydney Greenstreet's film debut. The Dashiel Hammett novel had been filmed twice before (once as a comedy with Bette Davis!) but never before had the ambiance of the cynical, hard-boiled private eye been captured so well. Bogie was at the top of his form, alternately amused and appalled by the quartet of grifters who would do anything to possess a mere statue. He plays each character like a violin and is always in control of the situation. Sixty-five years later Mary Astor is still sexy as the femme fatale Bridgid O'Shaughnessy; she and Bogie have tremendous chemistry. Greenstreet gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the fat man, Kaspar Guttman, almost the personification of moral dry rot, and there are outstanding performances by Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo (obviously gay, but it's never stated explicitly) and Elisha Cook Jr. as the neurotic gunsel Wilmer. The machinations in the last half of the movie are hard to follow, and one question remains unanswered: was there ever really a Maltese falcon or if the whole thing was a figment of Kaspar Guttmann's greedy imagination.",The Maltese Falcon
197,Surecure,A classic with good reason,10,21 March 2006,"While there are films that are considered classic for their technical achievements and classics that resound with audiences for a feel-good emotion, The Maltese Falcon stands in that group that is a classic for every aspect of its creative makeup. With a brilliant script, talented direction and some outstanding performances, The Maltese Falcon stands up today as well as it did upon release.When Sam Spade -- played brilliantly by Humphrey Bogart -- and his partner Archer are hired to tail a rich eccentric by a woman who claims her sister is being unwittingly kept separated from her by the rich eccentric, it seems like just another case. But when Archer and the eccentric are gunned down and all fingers point to Sam Spade for conflicting yet damning reasons, Spade is thrown into a whirlwind of deceptions that all point in one direction: a Maltese statue of a falcon.Bogart demonstrates clearly why he is one of the great classic actors of the 20th century, and indeed one of the most natural screen actors ever. His charisma, charm and intense masculine looks give him a presence that simply dominates the screen. With a host of other great talents to fill the screen, there is not a moment of wasted performance. The direction is tight and driving and the pacing never lets up. And the script demonstrates why there are less and less truly great films being released in present day: the writers and directors of the golden age of cinema knew that subtlety works ten times more effectively than the modern in-your-face all-the-time works.The Maltese Falcon is a timeless work that deserves its place in the list of greatest films ever made.",The Maltese Falcon
198,kuciak,One of the most overrated films of all time,6,8 February 2008,"A very overrated movie. I have seen it several times since I was a teenager, but it fails to impress. Why is it considered so great? When it came out it made a star out of Humphrey Bogart. He however would go on to make better movies. It was the first film of an heralded director in John Huston. He would go on to make far better movies. Bogart and Huston would go on to make together TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, KEY LARGO, and BEAT THE DEVIL, films more interesting and intriguing. This film also introduced Sydney Greenstreet to the screen, but looking at his villain, along with that of Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr, there is no feeling of menace from them. Could this be that there characters have been parodied? If you want to see a good Lorre and Greenstreet film, see the under-appreciated MASK OF DIMITRIOS, where they are more believable, and more interesting.I have also seen the BIG SLEEP, which Bogart did many years latter with Howard Hawks. His Philip Marlowe was much better than this Sam Spade, there were more sparks flying between him and Lauren Bacall in that film than the character Mary Astor played. Also Elisha Cook Jrs. character in that film was more believable, and the one great menace in that film, was truly menacing.Watching MALTESE FALCON, feels like you could be watching a stage play. At the time I guess it popularized the genre of the Private Detective in movies. Films like MURDER MY SWEET, followed, a better film as well. Some have called this film a Film Noir, but with its flat boring lighting, I can't see it that way. I believe that had Huston and Bogart not made any films of great note for the rest of their careers, THE MALTESE FALCON, would not be the great film that so many consider it today, and would just be a footnote in the history of Hollywood. I understand Francois Trufaut did not consider John Huston to be a great filmmaker, could it be because he saw the MALTESE FALCON?",The Maltese Falcon

The best part of the movie (aside from the badass statue, which I'm trying to look for a replica of for my desk) is the acting.  It's hard to think of many modern movies, especially mysteries which have such an excellent supporting cast.

I had referred to the high rating on this website and the 5* rating Empire (film magazine) had given the film when it came to making my purchase, but needless to say I was very disappointed.After much double crossing amongst the ensemble cast, the movie lets us know the movies main concerns - the whereabouts of the Maltese Falcon and who killed Miles Archer. By this time, however, I had lost interest in the film considerably and I was neither surprised to discover who had killed Mr Archer nor did I care for the character who had. Also, the fact that the Maltese Falcon itself doesn't turn up in the end made the main resolution of the film redundant, futile and again highly predictable. So to conclude, I wouldn't call this movie good nor would I recommend you watch it.

Humphrey Bogart shines as detective Sam Spade who has to solve the murder of his partner. He is a cynical fast-talking man with a quick draw that won't fold under pressure. He finds himself immersed in a plot to find a treasured artifact. He has a femme fatale in Mary Astor who won't give him enough information to work on. He is berated by the Fat-man (Sydney Greenstreet) and his goon (Elisha Cook Jr) as well as the perfectly played Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre).

207,loydmooney,relentless,9,29 January 2005,"This was the tightest film Huston ever made. Its better than the book because Huston ripped out all the worthless pages and boiled it down to its essence. But without the book there would have been no film, so good ole Dash gets the proper nod too, however the ultimate laurel has to go to good ole John. And Bogart. His best performance, his Spade is much better than his Philip Marlowe. However it is odd how virtually misread this movie has been. Everybody thinks it is about the Maltese Falcon. But if you stop and think a moment you see that that is impossible. The Falcon is not even mentioned until about a third of the way through. Yet Archer is shot within the first few minutes, and Spade is suspected nearly from the start. So the plot is fairly simple. But notice nobody here, or in Cinema mags, or Leonard Maltin, Roger Eb...well you get the idea. Nobody has ever mentioned what is obvious: the whole thing from start to finish is Sam Spade trying to CLEAR himself of the murder. Even the cops say so, and in the bargain he has that long great speech to the D.A. telling that particular guardian of the law either to book him or lay off and leave him alone. The Falcon is merely a device to keep things rolling along, like the Cherry Orchard getting chopped down by Chekhov, so he can let his characters talk. Spade was never remotely interested in the Falcon, and only marginally interested in Brigit. Notice in every scene, and he is IN every scene, all he is really doing is listening to lies, trying to figure out who killed Miles Archer: even that business at the end which everyone attaches so much attention, when a mans partner is killed he is supposed to do something about it, has nothing much to do with him. At bottom he is waiting out all the liars, until somebody tumbles with the truth and he can turn them in. Of course in the process he gets to listen to some of the most entertaining liars in the history of cinema. A great movie, horribly misread because of the wonderful slight of hand trick of hiding something huge in plain sight. If any film ever deserved a nine out of ten, it's this one. Can be seen and re-seen just from its rhythms and simplicity, from the sheer relentlessness of Spade trying to clear himself. Only the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers is its equal in tightness. And that's pretty fair company.",The Maltese Falcon

210,shariqq,As classic as Noir gets.,8,2 November 2008,"There is something very genuine in the pleasure of watching classic movies, and probably especially so for film-noir. Movies today, except for a few art-house works, tend to become as much about grandiose and fanfare as much about the movie itself. But watching classic cinema detaches the marketing angle of the movie, and you tend to watch the movie for what it really is.The Maltese Falcon is celebrated as one of the best noir movies ever made, and rightly so. Bogart plays PI Sam Spade with such craft and character that you wonder if they make men like that anymore. From the way he handles news, situations, women and enemies to his own style in the way he stands, speaks and reacts - without ridicule, Sam Spade epitomizes the classic detective that we have grown up watching cartoon characters and stereotypes imitate - whether it is to shake off a tail, confront the cops, cunningly use the display of anger to evoke a reaction or turn on the charm for the women around him.Complementing him is a host of equally rich characters in the forms of the highly-quotable king-pinesque Kasper Gutman (played by then débutante Sydney Greenstreet), damsel-in distress/femme-fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and the conspiring Wilmer Cook (Elisha Cook Jr.).The Maltese Falcon is not a very confusing movie. It uses a simple formula of limiting the audience's knowledge to what the detective knows. And as he unravels the mystery more and more, the eventual barrage of information leaves you reeling for a an explanation that makes sense. And when it does, it's just in time to find out something more! As the movie ends, it becomes easy to acknowledge the brilliance of the story's setup and resolution, and the path it takes to get there.My Rating --> 4 of 5",The Maltese Falcon
211,PureCinema,The definitive film noir,9,26 December 1998,"The noir film is one of the most visited genres of early Hollywood, and to this day none have been able to top The Maltese Falcon. It is, in ways, the definitive noir film. You have all the elements in there.. The detective, the beautiful woman who has some secrets of her own, the unsolved murder, and the brilliantly constructed plot which brings them all together. The Maltese Falcon is one of the first of the noir films, and definitely one of the best.Humpherey Bogart plays detective Sam Spade. A mysterious woman walks into his office one day and asks him to track a man for her. Sam's partner takes the job and he mysteriously winds up dead.As Sam investigates the death of his partner he finds out that it's not as simple as it seems. He soon finds himself in the center of a manhunt for a valuable statue of a bird known simply as the Maltese falcon. The mysterious woman is only one of a series of shady characters that are all attempting to gain possession of the statue. One thing leads to another and Sam finds out that he's much deeper into this case than he ever wanted to be. The truth is twisted, people are betrayed, and all is not as it seems.The Maltese Falcon is a prime example of how some people were just born to make movies. This film was John Huston's first, and he pulls everything off so flawlessly that you'd think he's been directing for years. Bogart is terrifically cast in the role of Sam, he practically defined the method of playing a detective in this film. You are him, uncovering clues and being doublecrossed as the movie progresses.

The plot is terrible and many events may insult the intelligence of a six year old (eg. the way the hero ""outwits"" the cops when they visit his place when he has that meeting with the female and that french guy). And I should confess.. I fell asleep around halfway and never did get to watch the remaining part. Nor do I ever want to watch it, considering what a ho-hum of a movie this is!  1/10.",The Maltese Falcon

217,abhijith-alpha,Bogart becomes the greatest of 'em all,9,30 August 2019,"So, I just saw the movie, which is considered to be the first and greatest American noir film.The plot is just there to serve as fodder for all these people to chase or be chased by Sam Spade and bounce off him. It is either too little or too much, according to whoever watches. The performances are really good, everyone stands out, especially Sydney Greenstreet as Mr. Gutman, the rich 'fat man' who is behind the search for the titular falcon. The way we are not sure if he is the bad guy or not is truly down to the way Greenstreet has played him. He seems like a guy with too much money and too little to do at times, happy to laugh and indulge in some tolerance of the antics around him, but then a few dialogues later we see a deeply obsessed man, if we look closely. Peter Lorre as the swarthy Frenchman who might or might not be homosexual (like I care about that), matches Bogart in their scenes together. Mary Astor as Brigid, the Tough Dame, could surely be tougher than what we see onscreen. The romantic chemistry or sexual tension is between her character and Sam Spade is also lacking a little. Maybe I'm harsh on her because I'm comparing her to Eva Marie Saint's character in North by Northwest (1959), and I wonder if I should, because The Maltese Falcon came out 18 years before. But the movie is about one character, and that character is Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart.We have noticed that tough, unpredictable, cynical guys in movies. It is some kind of unwritten rule that in Hollywood, every aspiring star and actor should portray a hard-edged, mean streets character. Well, this movie, and the character of Sam Spade, is where it originated. Humphrey Bogart scorches the screen as a cynical, tough, street-smart detective, always a step in front of his enemies. He has got some shiny, smooth talk on him too, spinning stories to turn any situation to his advantage. But this guy is hard. He is cold, and I don't mean cold the way Edward Rochester is cold in Jane Eyre, hiding a deeply affectionate heart under the toughness. Sam Spade is truly coldhearted. There are things he does that I wouldn't, not just because of how societal morals have evolved, but because they aren't what a good person does. He doesn't seem to care when his partner dies while on a mission, he is having an affair with the said partner's wife, he doesn't like the police or the attorneys and makes his views known, and he winds up other characters involved in whole drama of the Maltese falcon. But he has some sort of moral code; otherwise this character wouldn't be the template for thousands of films to follow. His ruthlessness and unsentimentality seems to stem from old scars and half-healed wounds. I've to remind myself that this was made in 1941, when the Second World War raged and America still hadn't recovered from the Great Depression. Tough times, tough people, and no one tougher than Humphrey Bogart.RATINGActing: Top-notch
Directing/Screenplay/Characters: No need to worry, just go and watch it for Bogart.Stray observations:So this is why those Men's Rights Activists keep saying that men were men 'back then'. Back then you could call female employees all sorts of things like, 'darling', 'sweetheart' etc., and get away with it because they're subordinates. So today's MRAs want to go back to that time; acting tough, cracking wise, smoking cigars, calling their female coworkers patronizing names.
This movie is the one that started the journey that made Humphrey Bogart the greatest male actor in American film history according to the American Film Institute. Who am I to disagree with them.
Someone should explain the cinematography and other stylistic elements, because I got caught up with the experience I must have surely overlooked a lot.

219,michaeljhuman,One of my fave detective movies,9,8 July 2012,"This movie has a certain undefinable something which creates a warm spot in my heart for it.I have watched it a number of times now, and it's always good.I don't place Bogart on my top 10 strong male actor list, but I think it's his portrayal of the smart, ruthless and tough detective (pretty much a stereotype now,) which makes this film special.The somewhat convoluted plot probably creates feelings of love in some, and hate in others. You have to admit, though, that there's far worse. I just watched the movie 'The Big Bang', and it makes this movie seem simple in comparison :) The plot is not very clever in my opinion. Usual Suspects is more clever, for example.The 'femme fatale', if I may call her that, did not impress me.The dialog is great in some scenes, weak in others. So I think that's a wash :) So for me, it's not the plot, not the femme fatal. Maybe I love it for Bogart's character; like Bugs Bunny, I can only dream about being so much in command of any mishap I find myself in. And the movie drips with style, IMO. Style counts for a lot in my book as long as it's backed up with other elements.Honorable mention goes to Peter Lorre. You gotta love his rather original character. More interesting than usual crook stereotypes. I will let slide the possibility it's a weak attempt at portraying some gay stereotype and instead simply enjoy Peter Lorre's performance.",The Maltese Falcon

222,StoryCharts,Determination solves a crime,1,23 July 2013,"The Maltese Falcon is about a detective who solves the crime of his partner's murder by dogged determination.The main plot is the solving of the crime (which ends in success), with a minor love interest subplot that ends in failure (the detective gives up the love interest after discovering she committed the murder).As a story The Maltese Falcon largely flatlines.The main plot moves from discovery to discovery but the turning points feel arbitrary and not meaningful. As the story unfolds, the detective unravels the back story of what the treasure is and how it got here. But the back story's revelation doesn't create much meaning for us or the protagonist as it mainly involves the secondary characters while our main character remains immovable and static. The main character untangles the sordid histories of these secondary characters to solve the crime, but we are left with a feeling of so what? In the end we get two somewhat moral triumphs: one, the detective solves the crime of his partner's murder despite the police messing up their investigation. But this moral victory feels empty since he and his dead partner's wife are lovers, which throws him off the moral high horse. The second is that he gives up his feelings for O'Shaughnessy and sends her to prison because he finds out she turns out to be the murderer. This moral dilemma also feels empty because: A) so he cheated on his dead partner's wife who was his lover to be with this new lover and then gives her up, how is that a moral victory? and B) The two of them only have 2 or 3 turning points to develop their relationship and their love doesn't have much to stand on.So the story is reduced to rely almost exclusively on a classic who dunnit throughline with some great actors who are unfortunately trying to breath life into empty cardboard box of characters.

223,bscrivener-50810,The most overrated movie ever made!,3,1 May 2016,"The Maltese Falcon is a 1941 detective/crime noir film, directed by John Huston and stars Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor and Lee Patrick. Often considered a classic by many, a masterpiece by some and overrated by others one thing is certainly for sure...I have never been so disappointed and my expectations of a classic movie completely crushed like I was with The Maltese Falcon. While it does have a few saving grace moments overall The Maltese Falcon is a rushed, terribly written and at times a unnecessarily confusing film with unlikable characters and uninteresting plot. Lets however start with the few 'saving grace' moments in the film, first of all the initial murder of Miles Archer fantastically introduces us to this gritty world filled with lies, deceit and corruption. The scene itself was very well shot and gives the story a strong start ( which unfortunately later falls apart), the next is the very ending scene in which Sam Spade (our protagonist) utters that famous line 'The stuff that dreams are made of' which ends the film brilliantly and completes both the character of Spade and the movie's narrative in a conclusive and well rounded manner. The rest however is a huge mess, the dialogue is rushed, many scenes often feel either completely unnecessary or cut off too short, failing therefore to buildup tension or suspense. The characters communicate in a very unrealistic manner, one minute arguing the next siding with each other and then back to arguing without any real reason, all while completely hurrying through their lines and lacking any emotion. However, the script writing is by far the worst part, more than to often Sam Spade often seems to stumble over his lines, ramble on and moan and whine his way through, completely butchering any care or likability we feel for his character. The same can be said about Mary Astor's character, one minute playing the damsel in distress and love interest- the next being a traitorous coward. Overall, The Maltese Falcon is a huge disappointment with awful script writing, bland uninteresting characters, an over complex plot, subplots that seem to go nowhere or are abandoned entirely, a simple plot device that seems to drive all motivations to the characters (yet has a very little part to play in the overall story), horrendously forced and rushed dialogue and badly crafted scenes either consisting of nonsensical rambling, long drawn out conversations that progress nowhere or cut short destroying any emotion, tension, drama, suspense or interest. 3/10",The Maltese Falcon

227,El_Rey_De_Movies,"Classic movie, not so classic presentation",10,7 February 2005,"The best screen adaptation of the best novel written by one of, if not the, greatest mystery writer in America. Dashiell Hammett, along with writers like James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler, dragged mystery novels from the 19th Century English drawing rooms of Agatha Christie to the dirty back streets and alleys of urban America and replaced the genteel amateur sleuths of Christie and Conan Doyle with tough working Joes who were equally at home using their brains and their fists. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a Frisco gumshoe whose tough-guy patter and attitude mask a keen mind adept at unraveling the densest of mysteries and brother has he got a case here. It starts with the cold-blooded murder of his partner and continues from there, dragging in a cast of characters who're all after the fabled Maltese Falcon and are perfectly willing to double-cross each other to get their hands on it. With a cast consisting of Sidney Greenstreet, Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook Jr, director Huston married great acting with great dialogue and produced the archetype of all detective movies, fast-paced, violent and sexy. But after all that gushing, I do have to say that Warner Brothers should be ashamed of releasing one of their universally-acknowledged classics in such a horribly decayed print. It's got hairlines, splices, bad grain, and what looks like a gigantic magic marker scribble during one scene. This will have to do until Criterion gets their hands on it.",The Maltese Falcon
228,mauricebarringer,Maltese Falcoln set the standard for all film noirs that followed.,10,27 December 2008,"The ""Maltese Falcon"" was the 1st and one of the greatest film noirs. It set the standard and style for all of the brilliant film noirs that followed. What a tremendous cast of marvelous actors. It was the 1st film noir and therefore did not have a library of films in which to get ideas. John Huston, age 34, not 40 as indicated by another reviewer, was given his film directorial debut and turned out a classic and many other classics during his long career. A few people who have criticized this masterpiece don't seem to understand or appreciate old films, and this is unfortunate.This film is 68 years old and the script and cinematography hold up real well. I want to commend GEOFBOB from London, England for his perceptive analysis. He found flaws in Sam Spade's character in which Spade was cruel to Miles Archer's widow...I agree...and he thought Spade was callous when he asked his secretary to remove Miles Archer's name from the window the day after Archer died....Yes, this was terribly inconsiderate. Despite these flaws Sam Spade risked his life to get justice for his partner (Archer) and nail the 3 criminals. Spade had his code of ethics and this character set the stage for the Bogart persona.From 1933 until 1967 the Hays Code, strict censorship, was a dominant force in films. Prostitutes were called hostess' or dance hall girls. Homosexuals were called sissy's and their behavior had to be displayed in a exceptionally subtle way. (In the novel, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook were gay, but in the film it was only obvious that Lorre was a ""sissy."") All films made during this 35 year period had to deal with this censorship.A viewer criticized Bogart's speaking voice and thought Bogart was new to talking films. Bogart, voted number 1 when the American Film Institute counted down the top 50 actors from 1915 through 1975, had a fine stage trained speaking voice, made 35 sound films during the 1930s and was Warner Brothers top supporting actor of that decade before becoming the superstar of the ages. Another viewer criticized the selection of Eliza Cook, a fine character actor whose career spanned 50 years, for portraying the bodyguard/killer and being too short and slight to be a menace. Cook's character was psychotic and killed 2 people without showing any remorse. A short and slight man with a gun and who is without conscience and unstable is just as dangerous as a big/muscular man. He only has to pull the trigger. After all Cook's (gunsel) tripped a helpless and drugged Bogart and then kicked him in the head when he was unconscious.What a great cast of characters, brilliant cinematography of the old San Francisco, fine editing, especially for 1941 and well written script and fine acting. Acting styles have changed since Brando started making films in 1950 and ushered in the method system, but the performances in this classic film were outstanding across the board, including Mary Astor, who did go a bit over-the-top, but then again this was before Brando and a full decade away from method acting.......definitely a 10.",The Maltese Falcon
229,guy_anisimov,you wont be disappointed!,7,27 February 2007,"'The Maltese Falcon' has one of those really intelligent scripts that might seem complicated but when watching carefully is very clear and very entertaining.what makes it so special in my opinion is that even though its old age (filmed in 1941) it could still be appropriate to watch and also impressive to the common viewer these days.Humphrey Bogart's very well acted private investigator Sam Spade, the star of this whole film noir piece is surrounded by more then a couple very ""interesting"" characters that give out some very nice performances as well and one peculiar golden falcon that makes them all twist and turn around themselves.one murder leads to the other and the guessing is left to us about who's responsible.justice, well not poetic but the kind of justice that will put a smile on your face when the credits will show up.you wont be disappointed for two reasons, the first one is that you wont have the reaction of not understanding why this is so highly rated or so well respected after finishing watching it.its pretty clear why it is considered a classic.the second reason is Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), close to the end you will hear him say something that will sound like this ""I Won't Play The Sap For You"", to understand what it means you must watch the movie but ill just give a little hint that in contradiction to so many men that fell victim to the charm of a woman, Bogie does not!",The Maltese Falcon
230,metaphor-2,Taking a 47th Look at a classic,8,12 February 2005,"This is undeniably an excellent movie, a fun movie, and one of my personal favorites. But taking my umpteen-and-fourth look at it, I came to a few realizations. What they amount to is that Huston's directorial debut was not as sure-footed as is generally thought. There are several very strangely edited scenes that suggest the editor needed to re-work the storytelling considerably in several places.Spade's second scene with Iva Archer clearly has a big piece hacked out of it. The scene is just getting worked up to something when there's a bad cut, and Spade tells Iva to go home. It revolves around the question of where Iva was at the time her husband was murdered, but the way it's cut, the question is brought up and then dropped rather unceremoniously. My assumption is that the scene was a red herring about whether or not she might have killed him, and it was later deemed unnecessary.Simiarly, the scene when they examine the Falcon has one cut to a very peculiar angle of Gutman, the only time this angle appears in the scene. Since every other angle is used two or three times at least, it suggests that there was a big chunk cut out here, where Gutman talks to Cairo about whether or not they should undertake the quest to Istanbul. Immediately after this cut, Cairo is suddenly on his feet and his attitude has changed significantly.Also in this scene, Gutman has two short but key lines that are clearly dubbed after the fact, and probably not even by Sidney Greenstreet himself - the voice sounds like anoher actor. While I don't want to reveal the lines because they involve a spoiler, it's obvious that the story was not clear enough as shot. There's also a shot that appears to be a single frame step-printed to create a short shot that didn't exist in the footage. Finally, Spade's last big scene with Bridgit O'Shaugnessy is kind of rambling and, if examined closely, has a minor continuity break. It feels like this scene has been re-arranged, that the different beats of it came in another order, or perhaps they are two different versions of the scene cut together. Of course, this is a long scene, ant it may simply be that the pieces of it, shot on different days, weren't matched very well in terms of angles and lighting.I'm not suggesting that this kind of editing was anything unusual. I daresay that an examination of another Hollywood picture of the era, if done with the same level of scrutiny, would turn up just as much editorial reworking. But the ""classic"" status of the FALCON makes these small discoveries very interesting. I would add that this movie was probably made very quickly, which would easily account for small mistakes and reconsiderations that needed to be made in the cutting room. I say this because, from a production point of view, it was clearly a lower-budget film that the studio ground out. The director - John Huston, was a screenwriter who got the to direct by offering to script it for free. None of the cast were major stars when the film was made. Bogart had only made one film of any significance in which he had the lead - High Sierra - made the same year. Mary Astor's star had peaked years before and was already waning. It was Sidney Greenstreet's screen debut. Peter Lorre was best known (in the US) for his series of MR. MOTO programmers, all relatively low-budget affairs. There are only two or three large sets used in the entire film - the usual street set, the lobby of the Hotel Belvedere, and the docks where the La Paloma is burning. Everything else is shot in offices, apartments and lobbies. They're probably all standing sets easily re-dressed for different films. There are no action sequences; I think there's only one stunt-man in the film, where Miles Archer is shot and rolls down the embankment. There are no car chases; I'm not sure if there's even a shot of a car in motion. It's mostly people talking and giving each other looks. In other words, it was cheap, and lower-budget films were usually shot on a tight schedule, perhaps four weeks.What makes it a great film is lively performances, deep directorial insight into the characters, intense camera angles, and a well-conceived plot that keeps you interested. (BTW, most of the dialogue comes directly from Dashiell Hammett's novel. The art of writing this screenplay was choosing which pieces to use.) What makes it fascinating is that none of the characters is easy to define. They are all untrustworthy, all hard to read, all concealing their true natures.It's probably worth an umpteen-and-fifth look.",The Maltese Falcon

It's always been one of my favorite genres for it's stylish cinematography, engaging stories, and overall dark tone. It's really fascinating seeing how this genre has evolved over the decades, and how they're just as big as they were years ago. But with all the great film noirs out there, I consider The Maltese Falcon the trendsetter of this genre. I don't want to say too much about this film, because knowing me; I'd probably give everything away. So I'll just keep it simple. Well it's everything I just described that makes this genre great. It has great cinematography, great atmosphere, great story, and great characters. It's just so classic it already seems like a cliché. This is one of Humphrey Bogart's best roles; he's one of the main reasons this movie is so great. He keeps it entertaining with his great performance; and I consider it his second best role (Casablanca being the best). Another reason I love this film is the villains. Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet as the villains are just classic bad guys, and I think they're equally as good as Bogart. Like I said, this is just a classic detective story; and it's great seeing these classic staples of the Golden Age of Hollywood. I love these kinds of movies for the cinematography, and watching the story unravel. I do think there are better mystery movies out there, but The Maltese Falcon is absolute Hollywood perfection.

233,thepartyoftea,The Definitive Film Noir,9,11 August 2006,"The Maltese Falcon (1941)The 1941 gem, the The Maltese Falcon is considered to be the first if not the definitive Film Noir film. The use of strong lighting, camera angles, deep twisting story and great performances. The Maltese Falcon starts off pretty slowly, starts as the standard detective story of follow this woman, then a murder, the main character is accused of the murder and must clear his name. The plot thickens quickly with whispers of a statue, a legendary statue. The plot undertow is quickly exposed as the main drive for all of the characters, including Sam Spade is greed. All five main characters are seeking this strange statue, bribing, betraying and even killing for it. Sam and Bridge betraying the love they have for each other. Kasper betraying and selling out the man who he treats as a son, his young assistant, perhaps sexual partner, Wilmer. The greed hits a fevered pitch when the statue is finally shown and all the characters get an evil look in their face thanks to an up shot. This kind of greed is also the fuel for other movies where vast riches are at stake, such as Rat Race(2001) or Resident Evil 2(video game,1998). The greed is also the reason behind the famous last line, ""The, uh, stuff that dreams are made of."" Since dreams often drive people. The greediest character is of course Kasper Gutman, who's shown as a large man. Often the camera is lowered to make Kasper appear bigger then he actually is, interestingly enough, Sydney Greenstreet, who played Kasper Gutman, was the largest actor the studio had at that point. There are two hints of the sexuality of Wilmer in the Maltese Falcon, in one line, Sam Spade calls Wilmer a ""gunsel"", which is slang for a young man kept by an older man for favors, also, Cairo tries to comfort Wilmer by rubbing his shoulders when Wilmer is set up to be the fall guy. The Maltese Falcon is considered to be the first film noir, but many people disagree. Many point to M as the first film noir, except it's missing a femme fetale. Others consider Strangers on the Third Floor to be the first true film noir. But most consider the Maltese Falcon to be a definitive film noir. The falcon's influence can be felt in several other film noirs, and can even be felt in recent movies such as Sin City, the archetype of James Bond can be traced to Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade. The film has been spoofed in several different ways but mainly in the from of the characterization of Cairo. Peter Lorre's appearance and mannerisms from Bugs Bunny cartoons to the Simpson's to the cartoon version of Megaman. The Maltese Falcon continues to intrigue movie watches because it's film noir qualities of murder, a femme fetale , double crossing, greed , style, and crime to name a few. The driven performance of Humphrey Bogart and memorable performance of Peter Lorre, while the plot draws the viewer in and wonders who really has the prized statue and what will people do for it.",The Maltese Falcon
234,lfisher0264,I can watch it again and again,10,18 August 2007,"The novel is like a shooting script for the film - in fact it's written like a film. When Mary Astor played this role she was about 35 and had just had a baby. She loved her bizarre hairstyle which was created just for her to tame her very curly hair. She had been a child star noted for her fine features and porcelain- doll appearance. That doll-like pretttiness, just beginning to tarnish, is perfect for the role of Brigid. Brigid is a woman who has traded on her looks and her ""ladylike"" persona (and total lack of morals) to live off men for years. She may be worrying that it won't work for her much longer. What she needs is a really big score - like a piece of the Maltese Falcon, or maybe all of it for herself. Mary plays her brilliantly. Her face seems to be burning away from within, and apart from her first appearance in Sam's office, where she was pulling out all the stops, she looks tired and haggard. So much for those who complain she's not a ""babe"". Another piece of trivia: gunsel was slang for rent boy, not gun man (according to Raymond Chandler). Yes, I agree that Guttman's voice saying ""It's fake! It's phony"" is dubbed on. And what happens to Sam's bed? In later scenes it has become a sofa and it wasn't the fold-up type...

236,tony-camel,The black bird of happiness...,10,5 March 2007,"Whether The Maltese Falcon is the first Film Noir or not is open to debate, but it's easy to see why it is generally given the honor. All the parts are there: The hard-boiled story by Dashiell Hammett, the anti-hero detective, the collection of distinctive criminals, the less than honorable police, the femme fatale, the mystery that leads to greater mystery, the deep shadows, the unusual camera anglesparticularly from the floor shooting upthe witty dialog, and the dark, uncompromising ending. Add in that it is a truly great film, and it's an excellent place to mark the beginning of a genre.The black bird of the title is the prize the story revolves aroundbut this is no Macguffin, as Hichcock labeled the item that everyone wants but is of no real importance. The uranium dust in Notorious is the perfect example of a McGuffinif it had been a powerful poison or plans for putting together a fourth Reich, the story wouldn't have changed; all that mattered in that film was that there was something the bad-guys shouldn't have. But any change to the falcon (as was done in the 1936 version, called Satan Met a Lady, where the bird was replaced by a horn) would change the film. The black bird is more than just a prize. It is, as Spade says, the stuff that dreams are made of. It is mythic. It elevates the quest of the characters from just a desire for cash to something grander. It's something just a bit beyond reality. And that's what good Noir is. The Noir world is much like ours, except the dialog is wittier, the girls are prettier, the shadows are deeper, the sins are darker, and the prize, be it treasure or the truth of human nature, is more magnificent.

His mercurial disposition establishes the premises which harbor his formidable awareness, this becomes his principle component for nourishing his yearning for survival. His chicanery is essential in terms of dealing with his predatory and nefarious adversaries. The disconcerting genre to ""Maltese Falcon"" cultivates an intrepid set of circumstances which makes the plot to this film plausibly entertaining. Interaction was predicated on going under the guise of a sordid collusion, as well as the clarification of euphemistic phraseology. The writing in the movie ""Maltese Falcon"" was very unique to the cinema in 1941!! Mary Astor plays the role of the spawn of a plutocratic offspring. Her inherent megalomaniac's nature seemingly accommodates her extra curricular activity of lying, it is just too bad that she is amongst a bevy of professional liars. These professional liars are boxed into a precarious situation whereby they must now tell the truth- This creates a very interesting paradigm!! The visceral affection between Astor and Bogart articulates both characters' struggle with a tenacious and lethal monotony. Sydney Greenstreet is virulently scruple-less beyond belief!! Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook are discarded in one way or the other, and, they become the newly ostracized guinea pigs for purposes of pecuniary expediency. It becomes a proverbial case of who is fit and trim for emerging victorious in an onslaught of sophisticated and conniving emotional game plans!! All film critics rate ""Maltese Falcon"" to be one of the most fascinating and well produced American films to ever hit the silver screen, I concur!! The plethora of prime quality acting performances in ""Maltese Falcon"" utterly astounds me!! Hal B Wallis is the executive producer of this movie (He is best known for ""Casablanca""). John Huston directs this film, he is nationally renowned for other greats such as ""Treasures of Sierra Madre"" , ""Key Largo"", ""African Queen"" and copious others!! Huston also made an appearance in the all-time movie classic ""Chinatown"". The aggregate summation of this movie is that it possesses top notch talent from head to toe!! If you have not seen ""Maltese Falcon"", please make it a point to do so.... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!! THE FILM ""MALTESE FALCON"" IS A TOTALLY MARVELOUS MOVIE!! PLEASE SEE THIS FILM!!",The Maltese Falcon

239,Emillion,"'I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble.""",8,13 December 2014,"A great film noir featuring the hugely talented and suave Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was a phenomenal character, playing the smooth detective. The story was very unpredictable and had several plot twists that kept my interest in the film. The action was very fast-paced and exciting. The lighting was very dramatic causing sharp shadows and low-lit streets which cause for an eerie and suspenseful style. The visual composition was very well done and the editing was flawless. Though the ending didn't provide all the information or tie up every single loose end, it was still satisfying and mysterious. Overall it was a great film for anyone who enjoys film noir.",The Maltese Falcon
240,stillnessbreaker,Fantastic Movie!,10,18 October 2012,"I don't think I have seen a movie with Bogart that I haven't loved! This was an awesome film, with lots of suspense and brilliantly played out mystery. The story and relationship between characters was crazy, but that's what made it so good, for you were always left with a question in your mind as to when and what the next twist was going to be. Bogart was a brilliant detective, he did an excellent job playing the suave, cool, and brilliant. As the movie progressed you grew to love Bogart's character 'Spade' he was always ahead of the game, which not only surprises the antagonists, but also wows the audience. Huston did a fantastic job writing the story, he also gave Spade some really great lines that made you laugh your butt off and cheer for his brilliancy! My favorite line of Spade's was: after someone complained about his brilliancy, boldness, and accuracy Spade said, ""What do you want me to do? Learn to stutter?"" It was so brilliant and the way Bogart said it was just awesome! Phenomenal job I was blown away!",The Maltese Falcon

This film was surprisingly fast-paced for it's time period and that made it a lot easier to stay focused and involved in the film. Although I'm not usually a huge fan of mystery films, this one was really great.The actors were wonderful and the cinematography was great. I thought the editing was rather impressive too. The transitions between scenes were very smooth and you'd never really guess that it was filmed in 1941. I did not know this film was considered film-noir, but now after watching it, I completely understand why. The lights and darks in the film were really sharp and the amount of shadows present throughout was never too much. I honestly didn't think I was going to like it because I noticed that quite a few films from the 40's were very slow paced and jam packed full of dialogue. Although there was a lot of dialogue in 'The Maltese Falcon,' it worked. The pace of this film was perfect, the story was awesome and I never lost interest. I would highly recommend to anyone into 40's films or films falling into the film-noir category. Really great film!",The Maltese Falcon

Bogart's character in the film keeps the suspense going until the end when he states who killed Miles Archer, his partner in a San Francisco detective agency.A lot of long takes are used in this film during scenes of conversation on matters of trying to solve a murder mystery. There are also some scenes that include short fast takes of being zoomed in on individual faces to help us connect with each to see how they are reacting to the investigation.The dialogue of the film was creatively done to keep my interest as the film went on. The lighting on the movie was a lot of shadow and dim lighting to portray a setting of despair and unknown.The majority of the film is based on speech rather than physical action. Which in return the audience must pay close attention to so not to miss important details. This kind of directing and writing by John Huston creates a different type of film for audience to enjoy while along with the characters trying to solve the mystery.The search for the Maltese Falcon Bogart is able to solve the crime while keeping the Maltese Falcon. Ending of the movie is the best part for me with the conversation between Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) and him expressing his true feelings for her but that he must do the right thing for what she has done. His dedication to his job takes over his feelings. Money being the root of evil is the main reason for all this fuss over a Falcon that had no real significance all along. The Stuff that Dreams are Made of.... can turn out to be nothing but a nightmare.",The Maltese Falcon
244,lhug74,Maltese Falcon,8,12 May 2015,"I really enjoyed watching The Maltese Falcon. Film Noirs are always exciting to watch to me. It takes place in San Francisco and is about two partners, Sam Spade and Miles Archer, who are both detectives. A woman by the name of Miss Ruth Wonderly entered their office one night in hopes of hiring them to help her find her sister that is missing. Chaos breaks out the night Mrs. Wonderly came and asked them for help. Archer was killed while he was tailing a man. Nobody is who they say they are and Sam didn't realize what he had gotten himself into when he agreed to help Mrs. Wonderly. People are dying all over the place and people are put in danger all because they were in search of a golden statue of a falcon. Sam confronts ""Mrs Wonderly"" who was now known as Brigid O'Shaughnessy at the end of the movie about killing Archer where she admits that she did but begged him to not turn her in. Sam ended up turning her in and ending her life of crime and destruction that she was living. The lighting changes a lot throughout the movie as well as the lengths of long and short takes.

245,demented_peruvian,Greenstreet and Lorre liven up non-stop Transatlantic exposition,6,20 September 2018,"Film critics seem to easily forgive faults in their childhood classics, which they constantly point out in other films. Case in point is ""The Maltese Falcon"", essentially a play, in which Humphrey Bogart sneers and gives a monotone delivery in a Transatlantic accent (with the occasional New York thrown in) while engaging in almost non-stop exposition, alternating with his putting down everyone around him, apparently with authority even over the police. It's occasionally enlivened by exchanges with Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, whom fortunately do not act in the bland generic manner of the most Hollywood actors of the 40s, and get the better lines of dialogue. There's also some brief but unbelievable fight scenes and romance scenes. The editing is uneven and sometimes clumsy, although it improves in the second half. The great John Huston alternates between amateurish direction (unnecessary zooms, awkwardly staged scenes, portrayal of women as weak) and some scenes with better flow, and the occasional interesting shot. The music is 40s standard, and the cinematography is rarely notable.",The Maltese Falcon

I didn't like it, because I am one person who really dislikes violence in movies. However, I liked almost everything else, including the quote, ""In 1539, the Knight Templars of Malta paid tribute to Charles V on Spain by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels... but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery today.""

An iconic scene was the end of the movie when the private detective realizes that the woman he has fallen in love with has killed his partner. The main character hands the love of his life over to the police in the end; this shows his honesty and loyalty. Throughout the entire movie his goal is to find his partner's , not knowing it was the woman's case he was working on the entire time, and his/her motive behind it. The movie is primarily about deception lies and loyalty. This movie goes hand in hand with the other Bogart film 'Casablanca' when the main character, Bogart, has to pull back together his tough guy image, after showing a more emotional side.",The Maltese Falcon

The images that was placed in front of me was amazing. I was just very appealing to the eyes. Definitely one of those go to the theatre type of movie. Meaning I would spend money to see it haha. The over all quality of the film was nice, the scenes flowed well and the acting from all of the characters was flawless. When watching I wanted to see this Maltese Falcon that everyone wanted, I wanted to see what the big idea was. And to find out that the one they had was a fake was a bit upsetting but blood pumping as well. I felt like I would go on the hunt to find what was desired by many. The film was also sad too. I say this because it turned out to be a action/ love story. I was really rooting for the romance that was but in place, it was sad to see that the main character had to give up his love for the justice of a fallen friend. Honorable. The facial expression Brigid O'Shaughnessy had while being arrested is and will be forever remembered in my head. You could see the heartbreak in her eyes and all over her face. It was so depressing...I wish she was a good guy but without her facade we would have lost some vital conflicts within herself and as well with the Samuel Spade. It seems as though her betrayal made the climax/story.",The Maltese Falcon

This film became a classic for Warner Brothers and you can tell immediately why it became so famous. The dialog between the characters is snappy and intelligent and keeps you interested. There are even a couple fight scenes that are menacing and keep you on your toes. You get sucked into what you are watching and makes you want more. The acting in this movie is flawless and the actors have just the right expressions and deliver the lines perfectly to get their point across.

It seems to come natural to Bogart playing this hard headed, I don't play by the rules private eye. I really liked seeing Humphrey Bogart take on one of his good guy roles. He proves his great diversity in character roles in this movie. The rest of the actors were brilliantly cast as well. While the acting and dialog in this movie was well done I really did not enjoy the storyline. It seemed very dull and the parts that were supposed to be exciting seemed uneventful. Not to say this movies plot did not have enough to its storyline. There was still enough turns in the plot and suspenseful parts the movie attempted to make thrilling.

Who but Sidney Greenstreet or Peter Lorre could play their respective roles? This film is also famous for helping launch Humphrey Bogart's stardom, rescuing him from mediocre bit parts. His Spade is tough, funny, and insensitive. Like the novel it was taken from, this film adheres to the standard cliches and language of the film noir crime drama: anti-social hero, seedy characters, dangerous femme fatale, bleak setting (shot in black and white of course).

This movie actually has an impressive story line, acting, and set. There aren't many flaws that I picked up on. This could be because I was too busy trying to keep up with what was going on in the movie rather than spending time searching for what was wrong with it. I enjoyed this. The movie may have been fast paced, but it keeps the audience interested, wanting to know what was going to happen next; they barely have time to predict it before the next exciting thing was going on. The story focuses on a group of mischievous people trying to track down a one of a kind falcon statue that is said to be worth a lot of money, and during their journey they come across a lot of drama and violence. I think I enjoyed this movie so much because it has an actual interesting story and the characters coincided with the script and layout of the film. I must say Humphrey Bogart did impress me much more with this film than in Casablanca, and is another main reason why I enjoyed this film so much. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was looking to see a great old time film.",The Maltese Falcon
257,yilmazomar,The best goodbyes are short. Adieu.,9,19 October 2012,"The story was dark and rather disturbing due to the complexity of the plot, after all it's a novel by a great American writer adapted to the screen, and the various portraits of evil and brooding men. The photography was atmospheric, conveying all the heat and suspense artfully. I liked how well the story was developed as the film went along how the anticipation was carefully built and released in the well arranged conversations and dialogues between the characters. The acting was my favorite part though especially Sydney Greenstreet as Mr. Gutman, he was great at portraying his characters creepy nature, there was something about his size and manner of speaking that just made me uncomfortable. Humphrey Bogart was the quintessential detective bad-ass, he was cool and slick and I rooted for him even though he had a bit of an attitude.",The Maltese Falcon

I always enjoy film noir, however this one seemed to have more to offer than the other I've watched. The story was completely unpredictable and I felt that I was constantly bracing myself for the next twist. The black and white cinematography and the low-angle camera-work definitely added to the unsettling emotion of the film. The movie was thrilling and the less-than-perfect ending was brilliant because it went against the grain. I thought it was interesting that they never divulged why the Maltese Falcon was so valuable and what it's purpose was.

I will definitely be watching this again, as it was difficult to focus on the plot and pay attention to camera and lighting work at the same time. Both of which were really lovely. There's probably some debate about this being film noir, but I think it qualifies—the lighting was just great. I love dark photography so of course film noir is a favorite. The camera angles and some of the tracking shots were particularly nice. I really love the characters in this.

260,john-hogan23,"""You Got Your Dingus!""",7,14 October 2014,"The Maltese Falcon is the story of a private detective named Samuel Spade. After a job goes wrong and his partner is killed Spade finds himself wrapped up in a nearly two decades long search for a priceless solid gold falcon statue. Spade comes face to face with the group of treasure hunters so eager to kill over the falcon but instead of becoming their enemy he is given the opportunity to retrieve the falcon for an unbelievably large sum of money.Samuel Spade is played by Humphrey Bogart, and oh man can this guy carry a film like an ox through the Oregon trail. Bogart makes Spade into one crafty mother-father, but in a way that keeps him cool as a cucumber. This guy's the real cats pajamas, the bees knees, see? And no pistol packing goon or dizzy broad is gonna get in between him and a fat stack of clams. Bogart's performance is impressive and thoroughly entertaining. He takes a character that even by 41 is already a stereotype and makes him into a complete standout. When I thought Spade was becoming flat and predictable Bogart surprised me with how genuine his outrage felt in his first meeting with Kasper Gutman. Bogart's performance makes you feel like he owns the words. He made his lines flow so smoothly into conversations it was captivating in that certain way that makes you forget you're watching an actor play a role in a movie. The only noticeable flaws in his performance were how goofy he looked in his fight scenes.Unfortunately, not every actor in the film was as convincing as Bogart. In fact, it really felt like he was completely surrounded by over-actors at all times. The characters played by Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook jr. were all especially guilty of this, and the skill with which Bogart performed just made for an even sharper contrast between him and them.I also had a bit of a problem with the conclusion to the Maltese Falcon's discovery. Once Gutman had scraped the black paint off the statue to reveal it as lead instead of gold, he began to go on the supervilliany type of ""Now's the time where I reveal to the protagonist every last detail of my intricate plan!"" rant. This has got to be one of the laziest ways to wrap up an otherwise fairly interesting story in the cinematic world. After learning so much about the falcon and hearing how precious and valuable it was there had been a lot of build up leading to this moment. It's not like the reveal itself ruined the scene, but there aren't many ways to more efficiently deflate a plot than with a quick summary of the details and loose ends. The Maltese Falcon was easy to enjoy. It came across as the type of movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and invites the viewer to sit back and relax while they watch. This however, can certainly hold some aspects of the film back from greatness. Bogart was completely out of everyone's league, and the film showed all the familiar symptoms of a less than seamless novel adaptation, but what we're left with is still a lot of fun.",The Maltese Falcon

Bogart makes this role his own and it'll never be bettered its the bench mark of private eyes. Super direction and acting all round and it still is probably got to be the best film noir.

It has a lot of twist and turns in the film. The main character is always torn between a number of things including a women. The Film is full of a lot of intense scenes. Humphrey Bogart is a very round character in the film and is very good at a number of stuff. It is shot in low key lighting to add to the noir effect. It is full of suspense and tension.

This film is a great representation of film noir, and the directors extreme care in detail shines throughout the film. The camera angles, angles that are low to the ground, and the films lighting, low lighting that is reminiscent of the film noir genre, are what make this film a great cinematographic delight.Another great aspect of the cinematography is that almost every scene with Astor, symbolizes the theme of prison with the camera tricks of stripes on furniture/down his face etc.",The Maltese Falcon

Humphrey Bogart play the part of aloof detective perfectly. Yet even though Sam doesn't personally care about anything in the mystery he still controls the scenes. The rest of the cast's performance don't match his but do perform considerably well. Although Mary Astor's performance as Brigid O'Shaughnessy is lacking. She never gives the impression she has any sort of plan or purpose, that she is weaving things behind the scenes, even though the script tells us she does. This stands out starkly when Sam and Brigid are alone together. The mystery is quite intricate as well, never once confusing the viewer but still not letting on any concrete clues. One flaw is that the score does not match the tone of the film. Whenever Sam successfully tricks another character in the film dainty lighthearted music plays. Supposedly this is to inform the viewer this is a clever ""I gotcha"" moment but it is unnecessary and lasts too long. Dainty music does not fit well in a dark crime mystery.

The lighting had strong contrast between scenes varying greatly upon time of day. Darker events happen more at night, which fits with the mood set by lighting. The cinematography makes good use of the lighting, but the framing tries more to coordinate the positions of characters with the background depending on which way the walls and furniture are turned.Acting is mostly good. Peter Lorre does better than usual and is able to appear pathetic yet powerful and power is almost never associated with Peter Lorre. Humphrey Bogart steals the show and makes his character very interesting by adding subtle characteristics which make him seem more real. Mary Astor is mediocre. Acting standards were slightly lower than they are now, but even so she looks bad next to the other main characters when she is so important to the story.The story is great. It has a really good introduction and afterwards creates a build up that is slow yet exciting. The dialog is really good. It sounds fairly real, yet it feels as though there is a purpose to every scene which each one being connected to the other. It feels like a 5 act play.

Twists, capers, madmen, seduction, betrayal, and murder, and all for what? A desirable object that may or may not be what we all hope it to be. This film is a classic statement on the human race, as a creature, or a population of greedy, powerful men. Bogart is swift and smooth,doing what he does best in this crime/drama. Many films that capture, or try to capture the same essence that this film creates are such movies as ""Entrapment"" and ""Wild Things"". The latter movie turned out to be a rather different story, but the previous is a good example of a modern film noir. The statement made at the end of the film describes the falcon as ""the stuff dreams are made of"". Back in 1941, we as humans were not ready to have this kind of power, and now, that propositions still goes today. ""Sphere"" has a good way of telling the same story at the end as Dustin Hoffmann explains that the human race cannot handle having a power of manifestation. Even though that is a totally different movie, it is still the same message to be said. It's a shame the message has been muddied all over in the past 60+ years. Maybe we will realize this again, until then? We as creatures are evil, greedy beings. Will there ever be an end???",The Maltese Falcon
268,m-visker,The Maltese Falcon,7,9 May 2014,"This story surround a detective, Spade, who is trying to clear his name and uncover who is behind all these murders that seem to be caused by the lustful Maltese Falcon. This is a breakthrough role for Humphrey Bogart, who then gets the role in Casablanca, so it is fun to see him in this movie as well. He plays Spade well and really makes us believe he is this coldhearted and tough guy. The way the film was shot really gives us the over tone and mise-en-scene. The tone is very constant, most shots have low key lighting with lots of shadows to make the it dark and mysterious. There is also a lot tight frames, like scenes in Spades office, we are able to see how small the room is and the close quarters that Spade is sharing with dangerous men. By filming the shots so tight it induces a feeling of panic and anxiousness to the scenes. Some shots even include the ceilings of the rooms, which isn't very common, this also gives us the feeling of claustrophobia of these high powered and dangerous people gathered together. When the character Gutman is being shot the camera usually shoots him with a low angle, and we are looking up at him. It gives the effect of him looking larger and in power, making us the audience feel inferior, not to mention make his gut look even larger. (funny that his name is Gutman, coincidence..I think not!) Overall this movie was something different and had an interesting story line, reminding me a little of North by Northwest mostly because of the anxiety the movie made you feel.",The Maltese Falcon

Humphrey Bogart had gained my respect after I had seen Casablanca, so when I saw this, I had high expectations. Thankfully, he lived up to them, as his role of Sam Spade was excellent. I was hooked from the opening sequence, and the use of the low key lighting really sets the tone for this film. It is in the lighting where I found that grittiness that I love in a film. This film is one of the best when it comes to telling a compelling story, and especially in leaving an impact on society. That being said, how could you not want to go watch this film?

The storyline was complex. It had pulling twists and turns. As an audient the film made me read between the lines. The title was extremely stylish and suspicious.

Sure, Sam was our protagonist, but he was rough around the ages and put his feelings before those around him.

Though Spade seemed indifferent towards the death of his partner, and was rather a little intimate with his wife, his motives were clear if you ask me. He was going to get revenge, but Spade isn't the kind of person to just go about and spill his true feelings to anyone. I find that the movie did its job with the interactions and relationships.

Film used the new style of film noir to give a sense of mystery and deception the film.

Both words awake a feeling of intrigue within us. Malta is such a little known country for most of us, and the falcon is such a grand animal, that we just rub our hands in expectations, and even more nowadays, since back then, both Boggart, and debuting director John Huston were mostly unknown.By the end of the movie, Spade (Boggart) will not be the only name you'll remember, because event though he dominates the screen by just being there, it is this wonderful portrayal of a detective which remains in our memories, and which has served as a role model for all detective characters after him. The rest of the cast is also perfectly chosen, specially by the newcomer screen actor Sydney Greenstreet, who plays Kasper Gutman, the fat guy, and another role model for villains in movies from James Bond to Mission Impossible. Cairo, portrayed by Peter Lorre, fits perfectly on his role, having that aura of queerness and ambition for the valuable artifact, and of course Mary Astor, even though her romance with Spade is not completely believable. The real magic of the cast relies on the chemistry all this actors share on screen, specially on the final scene.John Huston portrays for the first time on his career what greed can lead people to do and makes us cheer up for the Boggart character, whom even though is not an entirely politically correct character, still manages to appear heroic in our eyes.Hollywood might be very different if this movie didn't exist.",The Maltese Falcon
280,kylebristol12,Noir Is Born,10,9 May 2013,"""The Maltese Falcon"" is John Huston's first film, which makes it one of the best debut films I've ever seen. There are a couple of small aspects of the film that don't work as perfectly as the rest, but those parts are hardly noticeable. What Huston has made is the first true film noir, complete with a troubled hero, the femme fatale whom he falls for, and an assortment of seedy international criminals. Dynamic camera angles and close-ups turn what would be routine melodrama into pure suspense. My only complaint pertains to the film's ending, which, if it had been done any other way, would have been more memorable. When people recall how great ""Falcon"" is, I doubt the ending is the first part of the scene that comes to mind. After going through the film shot by shot, I have a greater appreciation for just how innovative ""The Maltese Falcon"" really is. What makes the film so enjoyable is its many great performances. Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade, a determined private investigator, and Mary Astor plays the deadly Brigid O'Shaughnessy. The criminals are played by brilliant character actors Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Elisha Cook, Jr. The former two would appear alongside Bogart again the following year in the legendary Casablanca (1942). All of these actors give great performances with subtle nuances that make each viewing a new experience.",The Maltese Falcon
281,amarv,The stuff that dreams are made of & the stuff that started an amazing style of film making.,9,25 April 2010,"I won't give any plot details here except that this is a wonderful crime mystery that started the classic film noir period of Hollywood. The movie starts with these lines scrolling. ""In 1539, the Knights Templar of Malta, paid tribute to Charles V of Spain, by sending him a Golden Falcon encrusted from beak to claw with rarest jewels ----- but pirates seized the galley carrying this priceless token and the fate of the Maltese Falcon remains a mystery to this day ---"". So we know that we have to find the falcon & in the process we deal with lies, murders, characters full of deceit & cunningness. You know the typical film noir settings.The Maltese Falcon is the first movie directed by John Huston who in his illustrious career was nominated for 15 Oscars. The beauty of the film is that there is not a single waste line nor a single waste shot nor a single waste performance. Everything is so perfect & each character is very well developed. I felt Huston has filtered the movie like water, over & over, until it became so perfect.The performances in the movie were of the highest order.Brigid O'Shaughnessy is not your typical film noir femme fatale as this is only the start of bigstudio film noir. I felt that Brigid O'Shaughnessy was the perfect template for the future femme fatales such as say Double Indemnity's Phyllis Dietrichson or Vertigo's Madeleine Elster. Although Brigid was responsible for the deaths of 3 people she never appears as a threat to the protagonist Sam Spade. Astor was very good in the movie. She keeps her best for the climax confrontation with Bogart.Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo gave an amazing performance. You can see the power of his performance in the climax where he goes from delighted look while opening the package - exploding on Gutman after knowing the truth about Maltese Falcon - controlled dialogue & expression after Gutman says that they will revisit Istanbul. Simply brilliant.Sydney Greenstreet enters the movie only around the 50 minute mark. He was 60 years old, this was his debut performance & he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. His years of stage experience shows in his portrayal of Kasper ""Fat Man"" Gutman. Those subtle expressions & gentle laughs. Simply wonderful. Elisha Cook Jr. in one of his early roles as Wilmer ""Little Boy"" Cook, the cold assistant to Gutman is good. Do the words Fat Man & Little Boy ring anything in your mind?Bogart lived the role of Sam Spade. That he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for this is quite a puzzle for me. Either the real nominees have given all-time greatest performances or the Academy is dumb. Bogart's Sam Spade is one of the meanest, ruthless heroes that you will see. I heard that the original Sam Spade in the novel was a 6 feet heavy built figure. Bogart is not a big person physically but he more than makes it up with his voice & mannerisms. See that scene where he mocks his partner's widow by saying ""You killed my husband Sam. Be kind to me"". His clap, his smile & his subtle expressions in that scene were as mean as you could see anywhere. Or that scene where he says ""Ya with $10000 insurance, no children & a wife who doesn't like him"" about his dead partner. Or the scene where he says ""When you're slapped, you'll take it & like it"" and slaps Joel Cairo. Bogart's Sam Spade is arguably the most ungenerous & masculine character until Marlon Brando gave that tour de force performance as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar named Desire. In a way, even Sam Spade was not a complete film noir protagonist because he was always in control of the situation except for that one scene in which he is intoxicated. Even there I didn't felt that he could be harmed.Think about the fact that Bogart was not even the first choice to play Sam Spade.Cinematography is by Arthur Edeson, who has worked for almost a 100 movies prior to this & he also did Casablanca later. He used some very innovative angles. You can observe that for most part of the film, the position of the camera is at the waist level. So we have a lot of low- angle shots which were made more famous later in Citizen Kane. The low- angle makes the already sinister characters more sinister.Max Steiner gave good background score for the movie. Editing is one of the key things for a crime mystery. Owen Marks did a fantastic job with editing. I only found one bad cut in the entire movie where Spade sends off Iva Archer before he gets a call to meet Gutman.All in all with one of the best ensemble performances that you would see in a film noir, superb script & directing, great technical achievements this is one of those films that you shouldn't miss.In fact, I was so engrossed & immersed in the story & the performances the 1st time I viewed this that I completely forgot about the other aspects of the film. I rewatched this immediately to concentrate on the other technical aspects. For me the movie, the protagonist & the femme fatale are not the ideal film noirs but rather the initial models which were developed into more defined figures for the next 2 decades of film noir. So, in a line, what is The Maltese Falcon?

It has great compositions in its shots, it seems very balanced and clean, which is very different from many of the older movies I have seen before. Everything in the movie seems remarkably composed and tidy. The transitions between scenes are noticeable but not so noticeable that they become jarring and the editing seems well done. The long shots that they did--especially the very first one on the phone--is really interesting and feels new. It also has some amazing photographic moments, notably the scene between Mister Spade and the widow where the light is shining through the blinds onto the wall The acting and character seem so-so to me, though I believe a lot of the reason I have decided that I dislike it is not because of the quality of the acting itself and more that I was not very interested in the movie itself.

284,slcagnina,Influential but overrated; novel much better,4,7 February 2009,"Yes, Bogart's performance is classic, and Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet are terrific -- they usually are. But the film suffers from the production code of the day; Hammett's novel holds up, and the sexual politics of it wasn't allowed to be transferred to the screen (although it could have with better writing -- Casablanca has a lot of dark sex jokes).The biggest problem with the film is Mary Astor. I don't find her attractive and her performance is mannered and oft putting -- which is a disaster for a femme fatale. In the novel, the character comes across as much prettier and smarter, and the sexual relationship with Spade makes her much more devious; it also makes the love talk at the end and Spade's rejection of Brigid logical. In the film, when this conversation starts, one is left wondering, ""What?"" These two have barely been on screen together and now there's talk of true love?One part near the end illustrates the problem with the story as filmed: In the book, when Gutman claims a thousand dollar bill is missing, Spade makes Brigid get naked in the bathroom as he inspects her and her clothes to see if she took it. Brigid protests, but is not modest, and Gutman is surprised that Spade would do this. This scene reinforces Spade's cold demeanor, the sexual relationship between Brigid and Spade, and impresses Gutman with Spade's icy thoroughness. As filmed, Brigid just makes a silent, knowing nod of No, and that's that. The Hayes Code eradicated a key scene, and the writing didn't attempt to find a way to make up for this loss.If Brigid had been played by a smarter, more seductive actress and the sexual relationship between her and Spade been alluded to, then the dark motivations of the story and Spade's character would be fully realized. As it is, it's a well cast movie (but nearly destroyed by one casting flub, Astor) and influential in terms of character, pace, and camera choices. It may have been the first noir, but that alone doesn't make it a classic. As it is, watching it is more history than enjoyment, while the novel still holds up as well written detective fiction.",The Maltese Falcon

If you've ever seen the other two, you'll know why this is the one that's remembered.First of all the script is great! If you've read the original novel, you'll see very few changes in the adaptation. Some chunks of dialog are lifted directly from the text, which most of us know is a rarity in film making. After all, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!Next, the cast is superb! Humphrey Bogart, though not the first choice of the studio (that was George Raft, who had a clause in his contract that said he didn't have to work with first time directors) does such a convincing job as the hard-boiled detective, it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. With Mary Astor as the femme fatale, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre as the mysterious men tied together to find the strange statuette, the story almost tells itself.Moving on to the direction: Huston, especially for a first-timer really pulled it out for this one. I know many others have written more about this, so I'll just give up two specifics. First, even though he's not the focus of the shot, you can actually spot the exact moment Sam Spade figures out who killed his partner. No kidding, look for it. Next, when Wilmer is unconscious, the principals discuss what to do with him. When he wakes, the series of shots of them as he takes one look around the room says ""Sorry pal, you've had it.""

The coolest guy to ever live?Have you ever wondered what makes someone possess an essence that's defined as being ""cool""? They seem to have that combination between imagery and soul that few people truly have. Is it in the style of clothes you wear or one's knowledge of independence? Is it the way you comb your hair or your unkempt humility for everything out there? It could be in your talk or how you walk, but maybe it's more about what you say and where you're going. In a sense it's an attitude that seeks to define character and break the mold of control. It's the fine line between knowing when to speak up and when saying less means more. So is Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? In a single word, absolutely.The Maltese Falcon is basically a showcase for Bogart. A role that seems to be made for him, even with two previous attempts at the film. He is and always was born to play Sam Spade. The tough guy private investigator, who always has the right things to say. More likely to fire a witty comeback than a gun. Able to fall in love, even if only for the moment, and then send her to the gallows. All in the name of doing the right thing. It's not an emotional business.The movie itself wrote the book of the crime and mystery drama story. Probably the best written plot in it's genre. No doubt that Bogart makes the character come alive, with that infectious voice and his uncompromising demeanor. But the movie itself is, to say the least, very good. The ending just does it for me. The last couple of lines are some of the best in film history.Although it took me a while to finally see this film, I realize that it's one of Bogart's triumphs and has all the main reasons why I love the guy so much.

Not many films could pack so much suspense and tension in a scene with little action to speak of, that takes place for the entire third act in Sam Spade's apartment, but the verbal wit demonstrated by Bogart and Greenstreet along with the equally good performances of Peter Lorre and Mary Astor truly livens up what could really slow down the pace of a lesser movie.",The Maltese Falcon

The movie in general is a great mystery/action movie with Bogurt acting as the moral tough guy that saves the day. The movie was interesting in that I wasn't quite sure what the message of the movie was meant to be.

Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook.
John Huston was established as a successful Hollywood scriptwriter when he asked Warner Bros. if he could turn his hand to directing. Warners agreed and even said he could choose his own project providing his next script was a hit. Fortunately for Huston 'High Sierra' (1941) was a success at the box office and he started work on filming his screenplay based on the 1930 detective novel 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett. The story had been adapted for the screen unsuccessfully twice previously and Huston was determined to make it third time lucky. Meticulous in his preparation for his directorial debut, Huston planned everything to the last detail with instructions to himself for a shot-for-shot setup, with sketches for every scene, ensuring the movie would come in on schedule and under budget. Warner Bros. wanted George Raft to play the lead role of private eye Sam Spade but Raft declined, not wanting to work with a first-time director, leaving the door open for John Huston to cast his friend Humphrey Bogart. The setting is 1940's San Francisco where Private investigators Sam Spade (Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) are meeting a prospective client, a mysterious woman calling herself Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor). After agreeing to take on the case involving her missing sister, Archer ends up dead and Spade finds out Wonderly (now known as Brigid O'Shaughnessy) is involved with a group of unscrupulous characters all of whom are trying to obtain a valuable jewel-encrusted statuette known as the Maltese Falcon. The tough, world-weary Spade is soon embroiled in a dangerous world of crime and intrigue with the infamous ""Fat Man"" Kasper Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet, in his first screen role) and his associate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre). Widely considered to be the first true film noir, 'The Maltese Falcon' turned Bogart into a Hollywood star after years of playing support roles in B-Movies and he would go on to have further success with Huston, collaborating on such great films as 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' (1948), 'Key Largo' (1948) and 'The African Queen' (1951). Greenstreet and Lorre became household names and would both appear again with Bogart in 'Casablanca' the following year. Brilliantly directed and scripted by Huston, with an excellent cast, 'The Maltese Falcon' is a timeless classic and remains fully deserving of its accolades as one of American cinemas greatest films.

But Mary Astor was so terrible that if it weren't for her sucking the life out of this movie, it would be great. This isn't anywhere near as good as ""From out of the past"" or ""Dead Reckoning""
The plot is somewhat interesting but wildly unrealistic, (at one point a character gives a man back the gun he was pointing at him 2 minutes prior after which he goes back to pointing the gun at him) , and aside from bogart and greenstreet, the acting is mediocre at best, the worst addition to this film is Mary Astor, she is a terrible actress who doesn't have the excuse of being too attractive to act, she's downright terrible, I actually missed the whole point of the film the first time I watched it because of her, I didn't get that she was supposed to be a femme fatale acting innocent; because she didn't come across as menacing or innocent.

In ""The Maltese Falcon"" the camera angles were slick and beautifully shot. The usage of light, and lack thereof paints a noir film masterpiece that I highly respect and revere. In addition, the cast played their roles perfectly and I especially enjoyed Humphrey Bogarts portrayal as the slick and savvy Sam Spade. He wasn't a traditional hero but was a relatable one that knew what it took to play ball with the best of them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a masterfully crafted film.",The Maltese Falcon
296,daxbeach,Film Lovers Study This Movie,9,7 December 2016,"This is by far my favorite American film noirs of the 30s/40s. And kind of light on the ""noir"" aspect at that, as agreed my many. But in narrative and style, it is definitely dark. Based off of a Dashiell Hammett short-story, this is the account of a surly private-eye, who stumbles onto circumstance and characters he really doesn't need in his life. The camera use, lighting (and lack thereof) are all supremely done in this film. Sydney Greenstreet is forever evil this story, and makes his ""Ferrari"" character in Casablanca look like a small-time street thug. There are really no characters with redeeming qualities in this film. For a while you might think Spade's secretary is above the scam, but in the narrative, she really ends up getting in on the action and following the boss's orders. Peter Lorre, like Greenstreet, is evil, too, and like many of his rolls as an unsavory type, you still might find yourself cheering him on. You will find new elements in the film each time you watch it, and if you're a real buff for the hard- boiled pulp of the era, watch it soon for your first time, then start it all over again, and identify what you missed the first time!",The Maltese Falcon
297,inemjaso,A well paced thriller,9,9 March 2017,"History's first film noir, characterized by cynicism and ""immoral"" sexual attraction, The Maltese Falcon is a masterpiece of the crime drama genre. The opening theme music is ominous with lots of brass and strings. The cinematography throughout is nothing less than cool, with lots of low key lighting and sharp contrasts. The protagonist, Sam Spade, is a classic Bogart character. He is extremely intuitive, intelligent, and charismatic. Though he is weary of trusting law enforcement as a private detective, his independent case work yields great success and collaboration between himself and the police. Spade's counterpart is a woman named Ruth who goes by Brigid for the majority of the film, due to her ties to criminal activity. The viewer can sense that Spade knows Brigid is a liar and guilty of murder, but his affection for her jeopardizes the viewer's certainty about Brigid being brought to justice. However, Spade values his work more and eventually turns Brigid in to the cops. Overall, this film is extremely well written and expertly paced. There are no slow scenes and from the first scene the viewer is drawn intensely into the narrative.",The Maltese Falcon
298,huntermcintyre,The Maltese Falcon review,8,7 December 2017,I really enjoyed this film. This film is an early noir film and I thought it really lived up to expectations. The film keeps you interested all the way through and is kind of fun being and early detective film as well. The acting is really superb and every character seem to have an actor perfect for their role. The lighting and camera work are good in this film but nothing special. I would highly recommend this film to detective movie fans or honestly movie fans in general. Overall a very good film.,The Maltese Falcon
299,cliodhna2,Possibly the worst film I've ever seen,1,17 September 2009,"This isn't just awful. It is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I am completely baffled by the reputation it has. Everything is horribly staged, everybody speaks faster than is humanly possible. The plot is all over the place. It's all tell, no show. It is just terrible. If I was giving a scriptwriting class, I would use this film as a great example of what not to do.I realise that, made in 1941, it is of its time. But isn't that the point? For a film to be called a classic, it should still be relevant to audiences today? I really wonder if the people who rate it so highly have actually sat down and endured the whole painful experience. Or is it sufficient that everyone else says it's a classic, so it must be.People, it's time to let this one die.",The Maltese Falcon
300,bladerunnerdek,Best of genre...Bar None,10,8 October 2000,"No other book ever captured the dark and gritty seediness of the noir thriller like Dashiel Hammet's Maltese Falcon , except perhaps Raymond Chandler's Big Sleep, and no other film has made such a stunning representation of a book like this one has. Much of Hammet's own dialogue remains in the script, with some strangely quirky phrases to give it flavor. Example...an odd exchange between Spade and Archer after Miss Wonderly has gone......    ""you might have seen her first , but I spoke first"" Spade....."" you're a smart one.........yes you are."" This movie has everything.......larger than life players with just enough eccentricity to make them unique ,a notion that you'd not meet this flamboyant ensemble in a hundred years of trying . And that's the whole point . The pace is quick and the banter is classic with few cosmetic diversions...the movie is all business . A curious sense of comfort commands the screen when Bogart's Spade is around, and he seems to dominate his scenes without diminishing the other performers.....something say a Marlon Brando couldn't do.Spade's dark moods and murky morals become clearer as the movie progresses , and even when events seem to spiral away from him , the viewer is constantly aware that he's in control . Beautiful touches from veteran actors complete John Huston's direction , ie.. Peter Lorre's subtle , sideways glances that tell the world that Joel Cairo ( Hammet's great gift for character names evident again) can't be trusted. Mary Astor's coquetish hand wringing and girlish hesitation belying her calculating menace. And who could ever play the cultured ""fat man"" villain better than Sidney Greenstreet? You could go on through every role in the movie because there is not one weakness .... and the seemingly ""silly lines"" in the script almost appear to be left in purposely to flaw what is the perfect example of film noir.

303,snollen63,My pick for #1 American film,10,30 August 2006,"Why? (1) Within the constraints of the Production Code of 1934, it is the most faithful literary adaptation produced in Golden Age Hollywood. (For those of you who prefer the 1931 Warner's version because it includes the sexual and gay material, REMEMBER that Huston could not OVERTLY include this in 1941, because of the PCA. The Code forced artists to become MORE creative, not less.) (2) It was the great John Huston's first film as a director; and it's arguably his best (and that's saying a lot). (3) It was then unheard of for a major Hollywood studio let the same man write AND direct the same film, and take credit for it on-screen. Prior to Huston, independents like Charles Chaplin were the only filmmakers who regularly did this. (4) Much to Jack Warner's horror, Huston shot the film IN SEQUENCE, so the actors could actually build their parts, like stage actors. (5) Acting in sequence, Bogart becomes more intense--in his superbly controlled fashion--up until the final moment. The last scene, when he delivers his big speech to Mary Astor, is the best screen acting you'll ever see, and it crackles with enough electricity to light San Francisco itself. (6) The entire cast is perfect: from the leads, to Sydney Greenstreet in his film debut, down to Ward Bond, playing Tom Polhaus EXACTLY as written by Dashiell Hammett. (Prefer the 1931 version? Ricardo Cortez was a good supporting and B-actor, but a real one-noter. Come on, folks. He wasn't fit to shine Bogie's shoes.)

304,ElenaP-3,A Bird that Flies!,8,13 September 2005,"I have seen this film several times, and never fail to enjoy it and see different nuances upon each viewing. Huston's framing of Spade as this jaded, small-time PI, could only have been played by someone with the smoky charisma of Bogart. George Raft would not have been too bad, but he didn't carry that particular brand of attraction that might hold your interest. The details are wonderful, too. The rumpled, bachelor apartment that Spade lives in - devoid of any particular personal touch, but still wonderfully evocative of the time period. The lavish hotel suite that Gutman frequents, the non-descript office of Spade and his luckless partner, Archer, transport you back to the '40's whenever you see the film. The feeling is that of cigarette smoke just hanging in the air, thick and acrid and coloring this sordid atmosphere. Unlike several others here, I enjoyed Mary Astor's performance as the unsavory Brigid O'Shaugnessy, despite that awfully severe hairdo. You sort of know that she and Spade are playing a rather dangerous game with one another, yet there is a very palpable degree of sexual attraction to one another, as well as the inference of sexual activity, something not easily accomplished in the censor-heavy film industry. You know, ""You use me, and I'll use you"" - no strings attached. As well, there is the inference of Spade's prior involvement with his late partner's wife, Iva, who still has eyes for him, even after her husband's murder. The meeting of Spade, Cairo and Gutman is a meeting of three masterful actors with a terrific degree of wit and repartee. Lorre's Cairo is already painted as an effeminate character the minute he enters Spade's office with ironic music, and the scented handkerchief that is remarked upon. Greenstreet's Gutman is a worthy adversary, as admiring of Spade as well as contemptuous of this urban PI. It is interesting to see when the partners in crime - Gutman, Cairo and O'Shaugnessy, virtually claw at each other over this relic, sated with greed. They're certainly of a kind. Elisha Cook's little ""gunsel"" crackles with energy and the urgency of his mission - to track Spade. He's a little penny-ante, dimestore version of a gangster, and Spade has fun with him in the process. The gay aspect of his relationship with Gutman is mostly inferred in this version, as Gutman later admits he ""loves him like a son"", but was more openly expressed in the earlier film version when the Spade character called him Gutman's ""boyfriend"". The ending is powerful and brings to a climax this story of greed, deception, and basic human frailties. They really don't make them like this anymore!",The Maltese Falcon
305,aubrimmer,The Maltese Falcon,9,19 October 2016,"This film was very well done. The main actor was fantastic. He was always what seemed like 5 steps ahead of everyone. Even when it looked like he was getting one pulled over on him, he would make a fool out of that person. This film was wonderfully done and had get characters that would balance and contrast each other. The main actor and his secretary had a funny little relationship where she was obviously in love with him and would do everything he asked of her and his character was intelligent and could explain away everything in a drop of a hat. The way the camera moved to capture the scenes was done well. It didn't move so fast that you were dizzy but when the cops and Spade were talking in the doorway it moved back and forth between the sides of the door to capture the person who was currently speaking. I liked how for certain parts and characters the camera would look up at them. It did that with the more criminal characters. The scene where Spade leaned down to almost kiss the girl and you see him see the man who was following him in the doorway in the building across the street the camera moved with his eye line so you could see what Spade was seeing. The camera work and characters were well done and it was an enjoyable film to watch and I definitely recommend watching this film.",The Maltese Falcon
306,g-britosgutierre,"Blurred Lines, Sharp angles.",9,1 November 2016,"The Maltese Falcon is a film beyond it's years, being recognized as one of the first film noirs of a detective genre. John Hustson broke the records with his directorial debut and impressed audiences with his use of camera shots and editing. The camera told us a story beyond the lines put into the screenplay; it showed us who the characters are, what they are feeling, and what the force of their actions have taken on their souls. Many tracking shots following Bogart through his journey of the unsolved case. One camera shot I enjoyed most was when they slipped Bogart a drug in his drink and the camera went out of focus, pulling us all in into his hallucinogenic state. When awakened clips of Bogart looking around the room for an address kept us still at a daze but with enough awareness to make the next move.

307,iami-4,It's A 'Ten' and It Is 'A Measure of Movies',10,24 August 2006,"This ""Maltese Falcon"" of John Huston's is a movie by which to measure others. Certainly I didn't see its first run (I was 6 years old), but by the late '40s when I saw ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" as it came around, and also found ""Casablanca"" and ""...Falcon"" as they made return trips to our little town, I was attracted to Huston and Bogart. Also kept an eye out for Lorre, Greenstreet and all things film noir if Class A and not ""budget."" (But I have to admit that Mary Astor's hair style put me off as a junior high kid with other preferences for good looking females such as, shall we say, Betty Grable. But I learned to value Astor's performance here and elsewhere. Especially here. Great admiration.)May I explain that at a recent yardsale I found what we're calling my Maltese Owl. At a glance it resembles the falcon of the film. About half the size. Marked $4. Got it for $2. The important thing is it reminds me that some years ago I was given the video, later found a tattered copy of the novel, read it, slipped in the video and, with book and remote in hand, started and stopped and took notes. What a lot of fun.Years earlier I saw a great TV two-hour examination of how Hollywood propagandized WWII for our nationalistic use. The documentary emphasized group loyalty with some of Bogart's final words to Astor. This choice of scene, in which he tells her that his detective partner's death gave him an obligation, was deftly extrapolated to the individual soldier's loyalty for his buddies. Something like this: -He was your partner. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him. He was your partner, and you're supposed to do something about it.- Here the documentary used Huston's voice explaining that Sam Spade is a man representative of those who ""walk their own lonely road,"" true to themselves and therefore true to the concept of individual freedom and responsibility. Thoughts worthy of our Bill of Rights.""The Maltese Falcon"" and other really good films of that time did things like this unconsciously, better than trying too hard. There were of course many movies that deliberately portrayed Japanese and Germans as sub-humans. It was Hollywood's way of ""assisting the war effort"" (read: support the troops), but Hollywood later had to undo the hurt. It wasn't easy; and for some it wasn't possible to undo. The job was very well done.Thank our lucky stars (WWII phrase) that we have such good film literature as this savvy work of Huston and his crew telling a good story in the honest way. There are funny scenes like Bogart taking both of Wilbert's big pistols and telling the two-bit gunman: -This'll put you in solid with your boss.- And c.1940 topical references like Bogart handing the guns to Kaspar Gutman and saying: -A crippled newsy took these away from him.- It was years before I had enough information to appreciate that great throw-away line. A ""newsy"" was a boy selling newspapers on the street corner. More than one astute critic of culture has said that the best of any genre is most often in its beginnings. Film noir began with ""The Maltese Falcon."" It is really hard to find a more brilliantly filmed example with such fast, funny dialog and unsurpassed acting. (Check out the eyes and the cheeks of Bogart and Astor in the final scene when she says something like, -Don't say that. I can't tell whether you're joking. It's not funny.- And he says -Don't be silly. You're going over.-) For art and for entertainment, I give it a 10 as I do ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" and ""Casablanca,"" despite their inconsequential faults. These three, and many others, are worth a very close study resulting in a deeper appreciation for film language in particular and art in general.",The Maltese Falcon

He thinks his partner is a fool, but is driven to find his killer, adhering to a code of conduct.  He knows when to sever dangerous relationships.  His excellent rapport with Sgt.

This film opened the door for film noir to enter the American cinematic vocabulary. Two-time Oscar winner, John Huston (The African Queen) was the right man to direct a film like this. His adaptation of the novel by Dashiell Hammett (After The Thin Man) is a wonderful example of how to bring a story to life. In 1941, this film was good enough to earn Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Writing.Maltese Falcon 7The cast for this film is one of my favorite ensembles of the era. Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca), Mary Astor (The Great Lie), Peter Lorre (M), and Sydney Greenstreet (They Died with Their Boots On) come together with an incredible amount of chemistry. Greenstreet earned an Oscar for his portrayal of the obsessed business man and crook, Kasper Gutman. Peter Lorre is equally wonderful in his role as the flamboyant and bumbling thief. Mary Astor plays her part well also, working as a character who appears in many forms. Despite all of these wonderful performances, I think Bogart comes out on top. His delivery of the dialogue set the bar for future film noir actors. His natural ease in front of the camera works to his benefit as he plays the cool and calm private eye.Maltese Falcon 1The camera work for this movie is nicely done. It avoids any dramatic movement and remains unobtrusive throughout. Thankfully the film also had a great number of sets to film on. Set mainly at night, the film capitalizes on great lighting to create the shadows and the mood necessary for the story.Maltese Falcon 2The pace of the film is good, and I felt like the story avoided any unnecessary moments.

And how did it take three versions of Dashiell Hammett's story to make a great film? Who knows, but the important thing is Humphrey Bogart did become a star, and Dashiell Hammett's story did become one of the greatest films ever. First time director John Huston wrote a screenplay that stuck to what was already a great tale of detective Sam Spade (Bogie) and his involvement with a group of people (Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook) looking for the titular statue. The performances are all first rate (while Astor isn't up to the level of the other leads, she is definitely not as bad as some critics say), the script is incredibly well written, and the overall ambiance is as good as ""Double Indemnity"". Like so many other greats, from ""Gone With the Wind"" to ""Casablanca"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" also understands that a great ending line can easily become immortal, and of course today even people who haven't heard of the film probably know ""The stuff dreams are made of"". Although Fritz Lang's German film ""M"" technically began film noir, ""The Maltese Falcon"" was really the first of the genre to come out of Hollywood.

I read the novel by Dashiel Hammet and it was by far superior to the film.  Compared to the book, this film was sadly, a watered down product of old Hollywood.  While his performance was good, Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade was far less complex then Hammet's Spade.  The film was a very dissappointing adaptation.",The Maltese Falcon

There are fights and there are deaths, but there's no violence in this film.Is it really noir? Really? It's a brilliant film, surely, and made to be enjoyed in the simplest way possible: the way that Bogart does... having fun with it.",The Maltese Falcon

While watching it your mind will jump from one thing to another while you are trying to figure out what will happen next, and a sense of danger and excitement will creep up your spine while you cant help but enjoy yourself. It is easy to see that so many old style detective films tried to catch some of the glory and prestige from The Maltese Falcon, and that is how I imagine why they became such a popular genre in and of themselves.",The Maltese Falcon
327,SonicAndy,11 out of 10,10,12 January 2003,"Some SpoilersIf ever a movie deserves to be labeled a classic- well, this is the one. Bogies real breakthrough signaled a new kind of tough guy, one who is perfectly ready to sacrifice anyone or anything for the sake of principle alone. Its perfectly feasible to imagine that Rick Blaine was actually Sam Spade at some time, before he ended up in Casablanca and Bergmans arms. They share the same point of view on most things, although Rick softens and does the ""right"" thing in the end. Joel Cairo is an excellent figure to have in the middle of a crimestory, conveying the European flamboyance which is either thoroughly inbred or totally phoney. A character Peter Lorre was born to play. Some people seem to think that Mary Astors Bridgid O´shaugnessey was a case of miscasting, but since she is rarely remembered for anything other than this picture, one might claim that they are not altogether right. I think she does a great job as the (at least) two-faced Brigid, who manages to sway Spade to take her side in the beginning, only to stumble and fall horribly at the finish. Elisha Cook Jr does the role of his life as Wilmer, the gun-tooting, hot-tempered youngster, with the countenance of a choirboy. A small role yes, but perfectly executed. As for Gutman, its hard to imagine anyone other than Sydney Greenstreet doing the part. His golden years was to come during the forties, as his whole movie-output was made during this decade, the first of which was The Maltese Falcon. He is the embodiment of knowledge, worldly charm, intriguing loquacity and the odd knife in your back whenever he finds a promising opportunity to put it there. Although Bogart carries the movie on his tense shoulders throughout, the cast is what makes it happen. And its superbly cast too, besides the already mentioned characters, right down to the easily-fooled Archer, Archers distraught wife, Spades more than able secretary, and the coppers, hassling him with accusations whenever the donut-shop is closed. Hustons first film deserves its status as the ultimate crime-noir, wearing the rugged mark of greatness with ease.",The Maltese Falcon

Of course there are good things about it: Peter Lorre's performance, aspects of the script, Sidney Greenstreet, and various amusing moments: but overall it's a poor example of the genre. First is the ludicrous plot. I don't expect this kind of movie to be realistic but it should at least be plausible. The movie begins well but as soon as Peter Lorre arrives the plot becomes so preposterous that it's almost impossible to believe anything that's going on. And what is that falcon prop supposed to be? It looks like something found at a fairground. It is supposed to be a work of the Renaissance after all even though disguised. The resolution of the plot is excruciatingly boring.

I think I was thirty before I finally understood the damn thing.So this may be the last of my reviews you read, now that you know just how intellectually challenged I am (when I was I away at college, my sister would write me letters that began ""I am writing slowly because I know you can't read so fast."")But even I recognize how clever this classic is put together. Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade is not as cool as MySpace's Dr. Clemens, but he is still a fast talking tough guy with Sherlock Holmes-ian logic.Peter Lorre (playing Joel Cairo) came to most of my generation through Bugs Bunny cartoons. Of course, we had no idea we were watching a Peter Lorre send-up grooming the monster's hair- but we film geeks got the joke about twenty years after we stopped our Saturday morning cartoons (which were replaced with 24 hour, 7 day a week cartoons). Who can imagine Steve Buscemi's career without the great Peter Lorre as a precursor? They both have those incredible hangdog looks and buggy eyes.A MySpace friend north of the border has ask that I take a look at some old classics. And in the interest of international brotherhood and harmony, I shall endeavor to give my insights on some favorites.

Some other performances weren't bad either - but also some were AWFUL (ahem, Mary Astor). But in this film the plot is *too thick*. I love a nice thick plot but this is over the top to the point of confusion. There is very little character development, IMO. The ""love story"" angle between Bogart and Astor was incredibly weak. To the point of being awful. The plot, scenes, and characters is just a big jumble of confusion to the point to where you don't really care what's going on in the story anymore. The one plus in the film, aside from Bogart, was some nicely written dialogue. But really this film does not belong in top 250, or at the least, belongs in the 200-250 range.

334,escapoholic,See Casablanca instead. . .,5,28 December 2011,"for Bogart, Lorre, and Greenstreet, with Ingrid Bergman instead of Mary Astor.Many other reviews remark upon the historic significance of The Maltese Falcon, and I acknowledge the movie deserves props for Bogie's turn as Sam Spade and for snappy dialog. But I have issues with TMF as a true classic rather than a relic of the early days of film noir.First, there's the femme fatale and alleged bombshell, Bridget O'Shaughnessy played by Mary Astor, whose performance has makeup an inch thick on it. Totally brittle from beginning to end. No chemistry that I can see between Bogie and Astor, or between Astor and anybody for that matter. Yes, Miles Archer goes gaga over her, because the script calls for him to. I haven't seen Astor in anything else, but surely she's been better elsewhere.Similarly, Mrs. Archer doesn't come off as worthy of Spade's attentions. She's mostly there to tip us off to Spade's being morally compromised. Second, I see many references to the menace exuded by Lorre and Greenstreet, but again I don't see it. Casablanca has Nazis in it, so L & G can do what they do well as supporting characters without having to affect stagy menace. These guys ain't exactly Robert Mitchum or Jack Palance or even Edward G Robinson; I actually got the impression that L & G are camping it up.Third, the quest for the Maltese Falcon just doesn't seem that compelling, even as people are being killed along the way. A great treasure like the ""dingus"" surely should have more interesting villains than this chasing it. Instead we get cartoonish characters, none more so than the pipsqueak Elisha Cook as Greenstreet's muscle. whom he allegedly regards as like his own son or so he says.In my opinion a movie about the stuff dreams are made of and the obsessions of those chasing those dreams shouldn't be pausing every so often for a chuckle or two. I don't think TMF ever made up its mind whether the characters should be taken seriously and tried too often to have it both ways.In sum, I feel like TMF is being graded on the curve. It's good compared to what came before it, but it's nowhere close to being in the same league as Chinatown, where John Huston, TMF's director, conveys the menace that Lorre and Greenstreet don't.",The Maltese Falcon
335,smokyjoe123,mildly satisfying,7,8 June 2005,"As a film noir, this movie encompasses everything about the movement. The overly masculine outlaw hero, a convoluted plot and of course a femme fatale. Despite not having much patience for older films, the black and white nature and slow camera movements didn't bother me that much but the major bad thing i found was that Bogart has the most unrealistic voice and line deliverance imaginable. But i suppose that's because he was in so many silent films he had no idea how to actually talk until the 40s. The plot is quite engaging despite spade's (bogart's) incredibly annoying partner in crime (or detective work) but at least he's killed off early on. The characters are pretty stock to be honest especially Gutman or Cairo, and you might as well have had a sign pointed towards them saying 'bad guys'.All in all, worth watching.",The Maltese Falcon

And how did it take three versions of Dashiell Hammett's story to make a great film? Who knows, but the important thing is Humphrey Bogart did become a star, and Dashiell Hammett's story did become one of the greatest films ever. First time director John Huston wrote a screenplay that stuck to what was already a great tale of detective Sam Spade (Bogie) and his involvement with a group of people (Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Elisha Cook) looking for the titular statue. The performances are all first rate (while Astor isn't up to the level of the other leads, she is definitely not as bad as some critics say), the script is incredibly well written, and the overall ambiance is as good as ""Double Indemnity"". Like so many other greats, from ""Gone With the Wind"" to ""Casablanca"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" also understands that a great ending line can easily become immortal, and of course today even people who haven't heard of the film probably know ""The stuff dreams are made of"". Although Fritz Lang's German film ""M"" technically began film noir, ""The Maltese Falcon"" was really the first of the genre to come out of Hollywood.

""The Maltese Falcon"" - it belongs to the modern American noir genre - is a movie that caught my attention from the very first frame because, as every worthy noir, it introduces the viewers with two typical characters: the private detective (here portrayed by the absolutely charming Humphrey Bogart) who gets entrapped by a dark lady (the femme fatale May Astor) in a web of lies, subterfuges and betrayal - the target? Finding a mysterious golden statue that got lost, precisely the ""Maltese Falcon"". I immediately noticed a couple of interesting things, completely different from the movie I'm used to watch nowadays: the prevalence of indoors scenes over outdoors, the recurring utilisation of shadows to cover much of the faces during close-ups, a lot of frames recorded from the bottom up, and the impossibility of finding only one final truth. The background, the screenplay and especially the soundtrack - with all those anxious little tunes - reminded me of something vaguely typical of the Nazi period. I've fallen in love with Humphrey Bogart: here, in the role of Sam Spade, he acts as a cynical, disillusioned and bitter man, wrapped in his own alcohol and tobacco fumes, but he also hides a very fragile and human side, masterfully disguised behind his manly composure. I discovered so many things by watching this movie, but I'm sure of one above the others: new generations should learn to appreciate more the old-fashioned cinema, because it was all about acting! No special effects, no magic, no tricks, just the real and hard truth, before our eyes, on a screen. Definitely a must see!",The Maltese Falcon

342,kentig,Film Noir at its finest,9,28 June 1999,"The Maltese Falcon is a movie that truly is several steps ahead of its audience at all times.  It is extremely fast paced, well acted & directed, and many plot twists right up until the final scene that keep us all in suspense.                            As the story opens, the San Francisco detective firm of Spade & Archer take on a new client, Miss Wanderley, who supposedly is trying to locate her sister, and also claims to be in some sort of grave danger.  Miles Archer, while shadowing Miss Wanderley that night, is shot down, the camera facing him, so we have no idea of the killer's identity.                                Sam Spade, while investigating his partner's death, finds out that Miss Wanderley is really Bridget O'Shaughnessy, who along with two wonderfully colorful characters, Kasper Gutman and Joel Cairo, are after a prized statue - The Maltese Falcon.  A series of cat and mouse games played by all four, leading up to the climactic conclusion, makes for great entertainment.       Humphrey Bogart, prior to The Maltese Falcon, had become type cast due to roles that had him portraying characters on the wrong side of the law.  As Sam Spade, Bogart finally was given a part that would in turn lead to the personna he was to become most famous for - tough yet sympathetic, loyal, and sexy.  In short, a man's man.                                            It is impossible today to think of anyone else in the 4 lead roles except Bogart, Mary Astor, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.

Huston's incomparable talent for producing great scene after great scene is initiated here in his directorial debut. In his best films which are many there is no dead time because there is something significant happening in every scene. This movie has to be viewed at least twice to be fully appreciated because of the lightning plot speed.

The rest of the movie follows the unveiling of what really happens. You need a actor like Bogart to help with this kind of plot movement.

I mean, the story is so straightforward, if you can't figure out who did what by the time you've met three main characters (there are only five), then you are probably living in the 1940's and have never seen a detective movie.The love story was scotch-taped on, and completely unconvincing: ""I just met you"" ""I am interested by you"" ""You are the love of my life"". Sorry, doesn't work, doesn't really even make sense. And the ending? Pathetic, lengthy, and pointless, as process of elimination (again, there are only five characters, and when the police question Spade about the murder, the obvious red herring immediately narrows the field even further) makes the whodunit part not only predictable, but inevitable.The whole movie boils down to people relating tales of what they have done, but not actually doing anything. It's not much more complex than if the characters were to be filmed reading the original novel word for word.

350,AngryOcean,The personality of private investigator in a film noir,7,6 November 2021,"We are expecting a sufficiently quick immersion into the atmosphere of the film. The eventful first minutes entangle us with lies in such a way that it becomes quite difficult to recognize the truth in this film. And if the truth is still there, when will we see it? Impatience increases and falls. Behind every scene, the truth seems to be hiding and now it is already close, but no, it was a lie again. Or is there still a spoonful of honey in this barrel of tar-and-lies?The main hero is a private investigator working in a bureau, whose space he shares with a colleague and a secretary. From the first shots, he appears to us as a man, courteous, kind, confident in his superiority over others. And, although this confidence sometimes seems put on, he still holds fast to this particular trait of his character. He easily recognizes lies and always seems to know what to do. Even the death of a colleague at the very beginning of the picture doesn't have much effect on him, at least the viewer doesn't see this and can only guess what is in the head of this cunning man. It's worth paying special attention to cunning - a quality necessary for an investigator. But there's no good cunning without a fair share of imagination and memory. The character is skeptical of everything that he manages to see and remember. His imagination branches into several supposed situations, which, in turn, tries to represent the mind of the viewer. Sometimes fatigue is visible in him. Pity for those who, as he believes, are victims of circumstances. But he never tires of reminding us of his superiority, giving preference to rational feelings: curiosity is above regret; long-term joy is above momentary impulses; self-interest is above justice, but justice is above love. Having all the listed features, his personality is an ideal tool for investigating crimes. But still, it remains very clear that he is just a very lucky person. And no matter how much the viewer sympathizes with the one who should embody justice and the law, this investigator is too conceited of his own wit. Being at the peak of emotional superiority, when a good set of cards turns out to be in his hands, he runs away from disappointment with a bad set, showing that he is completely untouched by failures.He easily switches from neglecting the people around him to carefully heeding their thoughts. It's necessary to highlight the extraordinary sociability of this hero and a fairly large number of connections, which, of course, is necessary for a private investigator. Traits that cause disgust based on how we are reminded again and again of his attitude towards all these people. They are valuable to him, but still neglect prevails here. In turn, some people really appreciate him, others lie to him to pretend to be the first. A person who is constantly in such conditions is forced to live in a lie, no matter what kind of anxiety lies bring. But it seems that the investigator enjoys such a life, he always knows the truth. He is there, and here, and his attention bites into the world around him, sometimes ignoring parts of the world that are not worth it at all, which he does not tire of reminding them about. As a result, the sympathy nurtured from the very beginning of the film falls apart by the end. Now the sympathy belongs to the other characters of the picture, and the investigator becomes visible through and turns out to be not a very pleasant person.The personality of the main hero undoubtedly leaves an imprint on the course of the film, which is quite natural. Flirting with a viewer waiting for a solution, but never getting the desired outcome - admiration, ending in neglect. The expected spoonful of honey dissolves in the water of reality, leaving the rest of the film's characters and the viewer alone with their existence, sweetened with honey water, but not honey.",The Maltese Falcon
351,liam-chapman,Blurring The Lines: The Maltese Falcon and Noir,10,16 November 2014,"In the 1940s and beginning with films like John Huston's 1941 classic The Maltese Falcon, certain American crime films began to be made with sets of very differently imagined themes and characters as well as a new jangling aesthetic sensibilities. Where most American films in the 1930s and earlier were centred on clear and archetypal conflicts and motivations (for instance the oft-repeated rags-to- riches and good-versus-evil tropes), featuring characters that mostly stayed within easily identifiable limits, things changed in the 1940s. As is often the case with the emergence of new art forms, this new film noir 'mode' was probably borne out of a combination of important upheavals in the socio-economic, global political, and academic realities just prior to - and during - World War Two.A characteristic of film noir which seems to be part of its very definition is the permeating sense that pretty much everything isn't what it seems at first. This is reflected across virtually all the components of each film noir, from their plot to their aesthetic style. In The Maltese Falcon (as an early example of the movement), although the visual style is compelling, the truly disarming element is the complexity and ambiguities inherent in the plot and the characters themselves. The narrative here is built by laying layer upon layer of lies and hidden truths, adding higher stakes and more suspense with each sequence, right up until the very climax of the film when the actual truth of the affair is tortuously wrenched from the mouths of the caper's players by the hero, Detective Sam Spade, played with unremitting verve and intense presence by Humphrey Bogart.Spade's character is a perfect example of the central theme of the film (and by extension, many film noirs which followed it). His private eye isn't a policeman. He's essentially a gun-for-hire, and while he mostly seems to operate within the law, he is at least as sneaky and cunning as the criminals in the film. He lies to (mostly maladroit) policemen when it suits him; he engages in cloak-and- dagger surveillance; he is seduced and seduces his client to extract information from her he seems to revel in his clever, silver- tongued confrontations with underworld types as he seeks to uncover the truth about his client, Miss Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaugnessy, and her association with a trio of greedy, unscrupulous fiends, and the mysterious falcon itself.When his partner is murdered at the outset of the story, he dispassionately tells his secretary to remove his name, immediately, from the office doors and windows. Moreover, it is soon revealed Sam had been sleeping with his partner's wife, who then is also jettisoned unceremoniously from the plot when she emotionally inquires as to Sam's involvement with the murder. This is not your typical good guy – an anti-hero at best! Regardless of his personal failings, character quirks and borderline objectionable morals, Spade's strengths and his actions throughout the film make him a sympathetic character. This internal complexity, paired with a classic performance by Bogart, make him a much more human, three- dimensional character than was the norm in crime films before, and it became the mold from which countless iterations were shaped.Brigid, the other substantial character of note, is the prototypical femme fatale. She is similar to Sam in her manipulative intelligence and no-holds-barred pursuit of her objective; where Sam was working the case for cash (and to prevent being falsely accused of his partner's murder), Brigid coveted the priceless falcon. Nothing she says to anyone in the first 95% of the film turns out to be the truth. In fact, the plot of the film is essentially a quest to decode her lies in time to save Sam's reputation as well as to earn him a big payday. Her misdirection and convoluted machinations to manipulate the men in the film is nothing short of genius, but what makes eventually makes her the tragic figure is that her greed made her cross one moral absolute that Sam seems convinced of: as the murderer of his partner she must face justice. But even this judgement comes with words to the effect that it was one line he could not cross in the industry of detective work, not necessarily his own personal viewpoint. Oh, the humanity!There are many more examples of betrayals and wickedness in the film, including Gutman's willingness to frame his loyal hired gun ""the fall guy"" for the whole affair when Sam suggests it, as well as Brigid's seduction of the captain of the boat bringing the falcon to America resulting in his untimely end. These characters are the archetypes (including Gutman's 'Fat Man' kingpin-type and the queer- coded henchman Joel Cairo) which continue to inspire imitations, homages and parodies.The world was in a state of deep existential angst at the time this film was released, in fact, it was released only a couple of months before America would be shocked to its core and drawn into a true nightmare by the Pearl Harbour bombing by the Japanese. Rumours of German atrocities across the ocean, the ever-growing threat of fascism and the spectre of American political paranoia that was lurking just around the corner likely propelled the narrative and aesthetic style and themes exhibited in The Maltese Falcon to reach increasingly ominous and arresting heights before the first cycle of the film noir movement would arrive at its desinence in the late 50s.",The Maltese Falcon

From sinister bad guys, to black widows and ""good guys"" who fall more into the gray than the black and white and play on both sides of the law, the Maltese Falcon has it all!!! In terms of how the movie was filmed: Is there a better setting than foggy San Francisco to have as a backdrop for a dark crime movie? Most scenes are filmed at night and those filmed during the day are always filmed inside with particular attention paid to lighting and shadows. Even the sets are perfect; Scenes filmed indoors are almost always set in in hotels or stuffy apartments filled w/ over cushioned, ornate furniture. Throw the cast of characters into the mix and the sets somehow add to the sinister nature of the movie as a whole. From greed to lust the movie touches on quite a few of the ""Seven Deadlies"" and it delves into the darkest things people will do when they find themselves between a rock and a hard place. A fantastic film that is everything a movie from the film noir genre should be.",The Maltese Falcon
353,faraaj73,Classic noir that made a bankable star of Bogart,10,2 April 2002,"""...along these mean streets walks a man who is not mean himself, neither tarnished nor afraid...."" Thus spoke Dashiell Hammett of his hero Sam Spade, the private eye introduced at the outset of John Huston's brilliant masterpiece The Maltese Falcon.Bogart carries the film with his genre defining personality, shades of which were later to be seen in other classics such as The Big Sleep. He is the not-so-aggrieved member of the partnership Spade and Archer. A crime is committed at the outset and the only clue is a lady Brigid O'Shaughnessy, played by an appropriately tricky Myrna Loy.Other characters are the effeminate Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and the FatMan (played by legendary stage actor Sydney Greenstreet in a real tour de force). Huston showed excellent judgement in using the dialogue in the novel verbatim without any significant changes. This is one of the strengths of the movie as is the excellent black & white photography.Altogether a cinematic masterpiece that defined a new and cherished genres that influenced movies as recent as L.A. Confidential and Memento.",The Maltese Falcon

Great film, entertaining from the beginning.  Some of the best films of all time are b/w. :)",The Maltese Falcon
355,proverb124,The 1931 original is a better movie and got the shaft,3,7 October 2009,"As ""classic"" as this '41 version is, Roy Del Ruth's underrated original '31 version beats it out in a number of ways.Spade's relationship to women is much better defined in the original. Bogart kissing Archer's wife at the start of the '41 version feels like a throwaway. It's easy to forget they even had an affair half way through the movie. In the original it's a defining moment for Spade - painting him as a true womanizer. The film shows that Archer knows what's going on and isn't happy about it. Spade's happy/sleazy persona in the original makes much better sense than Bogart's tough, smirky one. While it's lovable, it doesn't service the drama as well. In the original, when Spade is alone with Ruth Wonderly at his place you wonder who is exploiting who and there's a lion's share of real sexual tension. It feels dirtier and truer despite being shot ten years earlier. It's great to watch.In Huston's remake, Bogart's too smart to be gotten and there's so little actual attraction it's all cat-and-mouse with no real chance of romance.When Ruth finally comes over to Bogart's apartment, Houston puts Cairo in the scene before the cops arrive. This kills all the sexual tension, turning it into more increasingly convoluted cat-and-mouse writing rather than something relatable.There are elements Huston added to the '41 version that further convolute the story. The entire scene in which Bogart messes with the Wilmer character in the hotel while speaking to Joel Cairo about his night at the police station is unnecessary and confusing. It's a scene that is smartly not in the '31 version.Lastly, the ending is so much more profound in the original that the '41 version doesn't hold a candle to it. ""The stuff that dreams are made of"" is a famous Bogart line, but is a sad compensation for the power of the original conclusion in which Ruth actually does fall for Sam, but he realizes it after it's far too late. The final scene takes place between them when he comes to visit her in prison, after getting a promotion. It's astonishingly heartbreaking and extraordinarily well done.History be damned.Incidentally Houston was nominated for a screen writing Oscar for this script. If you look at how much of the structure and screenplay remain the same in his remake, it's an outrageous nomination. The things Houston added actually detract from and confuse the narrative rather than making it better in any way.See the original!",The Maltese Falcon
356,Tony-248,The perfect film noir.,10,5 July 1999,"Perfectly scripted and wonderfully acted, The Maltese Falcon is film noir at its very best.    Not a word of dialogue is wasted. Read the original Hammett novel after seeing the movie and, as you do, you will hear the voices of Bogart, Lorre, Greenstreet and the rest of the cast speaking their lines.    What a pity Sidney Greenstreet was not ""discovered"" by the movies earlier. In his few remaining years he proved himself the perfect Hollywood villain.

357,highway61-3,The definition of film noir. My favorite movie of all time.,10,27 June 2000,"To say the ""Maltese Falcon"" is a great movie does not do this film justice. If anyone is wondering why Humphrey Bogart has become a cultural icon, they need only view this classic to find out. He carries with him such an air of confidence and determination that he transcends the abilities of normal mortal actors of any age. His ironic nature with a sense of the absurd combines with an uncanny and unerring understanding of human nature in all of its subtle grandeur. This may seem a bit over- blown, but he is such an enigma that getting a handle on his precise character is a very daunting task indeed. I am speaking of Bogart the man as well as his role as Sam Spade. That is the foundation from which John Huston, in his first directing effort, constructed this seemless study of greed and lust for riches. This is a film about people who through circumstances reveal the true strength and fallacy of us all. And with all of this heavy handedness, there is room for very warm and comical structures to even out the story. I first watched this movie about 28 or so years ago. I loved it immediately and have allways considered this my all time favorite movie. If you could put ""Citizen Kane"",""Gone With The Wind"", and ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" together, that would be to me the essence of ""Maltese Falcon"". That is not to detract from each of these great films, I love them all. But their essence is very similar to ""Maltese Falcon"" in their basic structure and character maping. If you are interested in life at its best and a good understanding of yourself, then watch this great movie and be prepared to be astonished.

359,william-c-dale,Simply magic.,10,15 May 2012,"One of the greatest and most enjoyable films I have seen. Bogart as Sam Spade is truly marvelous. Spade is sardonic, brave, devilish, knowing, a true character and possibly the most riveting on screen presence of all time. The plot is so engaging and inventive and the dialog so witty and sparky that I was welling up through sheer joy at the proceedings. It is also very moving in the standard sense. The noire-ish atmosphere is striking but not over done and every scene is framed beautifully and meticulously thought out. It is as tight a film as any thriller and puts most modern drama films to shame. I mean even the fight scenes are terrific. When Spade slaps around people it looks as if they really are getting a serious beating from a pro. The sound of the punching is not over the top like in some older films. It is as real as I've seen on film and I felt I was watching a film that was way ahead of it's time in that sense. I can't say enough good things about this picture. They almost certainly don't make 'em like this any more, and that's coming from a 27 year old who does like his occasional modern blockbuster.

Everything falls perfectly into place, from the dark, bleak, San Francisco setting, to the stereotypical, yet effective 'coppers', to each and every character. It's as if everybody involved in the making of this film knew they had a winner, and took it upon themselves to give a performance of a lifetime. Then there's Bogey...slick, cool, calculating and witty.

The story keeps a steady pace with the occasional drag. Acting was fantastic with the exception of Mary Astor, who slightly milked her role. Peter Lorre is just hilarious in this movie with his slightly psychopathic dialogue. The action though minimal is presented in parts that seem to make people lose interest and is then drawn back to see what happens next.

However, when I saw it, I was totally shocked at how well made this film was. The performances, the writing, the cinematography, it's all there. There is so much I could say about this movie, but I'll keep it short. The three performances I particularly want to praise are those of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. Bogart is so chillingly jaded and almost cynical that you find yourself hating him and at the same time wanting to be him. He's so cool that you just want to hit him. Sydney Greenstreet's portrayal is subtle and calculated, and treats you, much like the movie, like an adult that doesn't need everything spelled out for you. And Peter Lorre is so slimy and unlikeable; it's perfect. Also, the script itself is intelligent and well crafted. Overall, I totally recommend this movie 10/10",The Maltese Falcon
364,ray3121970,One of the greats,10,21 October 2005,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. One reason is the look of the film. It was released in the same year as Citzen Kane and praise for that film's innovations overshadowed it; but like Welles' film, The Maltese Falcon was one of the first great examples of the technique of ""deep focus"" cinematography, which allowed Huston to get great black and white images, that deep-grained clarity you appreciate but are barely aware of. He also used light and shadow to great effect, far more subtly than Citzen Kane. Of course it has stylised dialogue in the manner of the Hammett book upon which it is based, but the brilliant cast gives the characters real depth. The defining emotion of the story is greed and the hardness and ruthlessness that they all display to get their hands on the Falcon, best of all Mary Astor as Brigid. She's ambiguous to the end. You know she's as hard as any of them and you're never quite sure whether her vulnerability is real or a carefully controlled put-on. This is an intelligent film -- I would disagree with the reviewer who said it's complex from the start. It develops the characters and it makes twists and turns, but an averagely intelligent person would never lose his way.

His character, Sam Spade, is such a fascinating character because he appears unscrupulous and somewhat crooked in his actions but, he doesn't hesitate to take the case to unravel the mystery of his murdered partner.  Although Bogart, without a doubt, steals the show, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet provide great precursoring performances to their later roles of Ugarte and Ferrari in Casablanca. Looking at the movie from a whole, I love the fact that their are basically only a small handfull of characters in the this film.  When casts lack numbers, I believe it provides more insight to all the characters instead of trying to concentrate on a hoard of characters coming in and going out.  Film Noir films always provide a unique way of shooting, and THe Maltese Falcon is no different.

370,brittannelein,Great Movie - John Huston's The Maltese Falcon (1941),10,27 December 2020,"The Maltese Falcon is a film noir from 1941. It was John Huston's first film and undoubtably his best (Sorry, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre). The movie was also the first film noir, and maybe the best.
In The Maltese Falcon, we met detective Sam Spade, played by Humphrey Bogart. His client, played by Mary Astor, leads him into a web of lies, crime, violence, murder, deception and the search for a golden falcon statuatte.
The mystery is one of cinema's greatest. Every single twist in the story is unexpected. You never know where the story is going to go. All this is because of the brilliant and groundbreaking screenplay. Can we give John Huston an applause for writing this amazing screenplay?
The Maltese Falcon would not have been as good without the screenplay. The same goes for the acting. Humphrey Bogart is one of the greatest actors, and The Maltese Falcon is one of his best and most iconic performances. I loved him in the whole movie, but if I have to pick one moment, I would say when he confronts Mary Astor.
Speaking of Mary Astor, she delivers her best role in this movie. You never knew if her character was lying or speaking the truth, and this is probably because of Astor's brilliant acting. The way she changes emotions in a few second and how she delivers her lies. The performance is terrific.
And then we have Lorre and Greenstreet. Peter Lorre is a actor is love. His performance in M still stand as one of the best. Peter Lorre was often typecast as the henchman, which is slightly annoying, because he could not show all of his acting talent in these roles, but he did an amazing job in this movie.
Sydney Greenstreet is maybe my favorite supporting role in the whole movie. There was not one moment where I didn't love his character. He delivers every movement and line perfectly. Gutman is one of my favorite movie villains of all time, and that's probably because of Greenstreet's amazing performance.
All in all, this is a masterpiece of cinema. The mystery is so great and captivating. Every twist is unexpected. I can't recommend this movie enough.",The Maltese Falcon

A film were if you do not pay attention to the plot, you can loose it after 10 minutes. It also has a distinct elegance, class and style, that you can not help but notice. The use of 'High' and 'Low' key lighting to convey emotions to the audience, classic lines such as: When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.

I'm sorry, but its not.Humphrey Bogart and Peter Lorre are fantastic in their respective roles and the movie is worth watching for them alone.  Sydney Greenstreet pulls off another good character portrayal as well.  But Mary Astor is just dreadful. Am I the only one to see her reading from a queue card in her first speech in Spade and Archer's office? From then on she continues to be wooden and boring.  No wonder Bogey turned her over to the other side in the end, I would have too.  I saw better chemistry in my 8th grade science class.And what is up with Wilmer Cook.  How did this guy get to be a gangster? He is incompetent and meek.  What was the Gutman thinking taking on this guy? Brigid works herself into a tizzy when she first learns the Fat Man is in town, but Why?  Because of this guy?The story does have a very tidy plot that is enjoyable to watch unfold. But why does Sam spade, who is smart enough to talk two policemen out of arresting everybody, give a gun back to Cairo AND Wilmer?  You can say it's because he knew they needed him alive, but come on, its just plain stupid to give the enemy his gun back... twice.  He should have learned his lesson the first time, or not bothered to take the gun away at all.Despite the problems I have, I'd still recommend this classic to anyone who enjoys a good movie, especially to Lorre or Bogey fans.

380,zachhutt,Maltese Falcon,9,13 December 2016,"The Maltese Falcon The plot of the Maltese Falcon, is this, Humphry Bogart plays a private investigator at the detective agency called Spade and Archer. Bogie's character is named Sam Spade, who works with a man named archer. One day a women comes in telling Bogie that she is looking for he sister but that she needs help. Spade sends Archer to go find her and he gets shot. This is when Sam realizes that all of this kerfuffle was not over some girls' sister, but over something else. Bogie finds out that it is a granite bird that is called the Maltese Falcon. Bogie then tricks all of the criminals including the one that he is now in love with, and they all go to jail leaving Sam alone. The theme of The Maltese Falcon is that sometimes the person the person that you have feelings for does not work out. Another example that of a movie that has this theme is the more famous cousin of The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca. The formula for the two movies are the same, the situation that the cast was in in the beginning of the film is different. A man and a women meet, there is all of this chaos all over the place, then the man realizes that their love would not last and tricks her so that they would likely never see each other again. One example of this theme is at the very end of the film, when Brigid O'Shaughnessy is being taken away in hand cuffs, they take an elevator and they get on and it is bars going across, like prison bars. The elevator then went down, like hell. This elevator, is just like the plane on the film Casablanca, is representative of leaving. In the Maltese Falcon, the leaving was to jail, while in the film Casablanca it was to help the Allies in World War II. The angles in this scene really brought the whole film together. Another example of this is the way that in the beginning of the film in the office the scenes color was bright, however during the more intense scenes of the film it gets darker and darker. By the time that we are at the end of the film we are in a dark scene. This is representative of losing, losing time, losing light, or in this case losing love.",The Maltese Falcon

For years I have recognize him as Walter Houston, father of John. I could be wrong but look at him carefully. Did John got short of one actor at the time when his dad was by his side?

This is comic relief of a special type, if it is comic relief at all.There's a particular plot device here: two sides chasing after the same object. It's very effective. It's what drives The DaVinci Code. But The DaVinci Code is The Maltese Falcon on steroids. This is the pure form.",The Maltese Falcon
