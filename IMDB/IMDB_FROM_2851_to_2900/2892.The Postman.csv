0,Leofwine_draca,Would have been a good film at half the length,4,12 October 2016,"Kevin Costner's second post-apocalypse movie in the same number of years after WATERWORLD is a real yawner of a film, simply because the limited story does not fill three hours of screen time. An hour and a half and this might have made a decent movie, but at three hours the pacing is a crawl and the film difficult to sit through without losing interest. As an adventure, it's also seriously lacking in the kind of action these films require, and the minimal battles and fights that do exist are rather mundanely portrayed and uninteresting. Instead, it appears that Costner is interested in the moralising, the sentimentality, and the occasionally pretentious storyline about an everyday drifter who pretends to be a postman and invents a story of a new government in order to bring hope to the post-holocaust masses.It has to be said that the story is original and interesting (a rarity these days), but the endless padding and cheesy romance between Costner and Olivia Williams seriously drags things down. Costner is adequate in the role as the hero but seems unsure of himself at times, just giving vague expressions instead of acting when he has to. Instead of the clear-cut heroic roles of his past, instead he's portrayed as a pacifist and occasional coward who only fights after being hunted down by the enemy. His thunder is somewhat stolen by the superb and underrated Will Patton as the bad guy, General Bethlehem, who gives an in-depth and multi-layered performance as the intelligent villain and has a great screen presence - it's a shame this man doesn't get leading roles. Larenz Tate is also good as the young patriot, but Olivia Williams and her corny romance belongs in another film. The supporting cast is littered with the familiar faces of James Russo, Daniel von Bargen, Tom Petty, Giovanni Ribisi, and Joe Santos, but nobody gets a look in much and the only developed characters are Costner, Tate, Williams, and Patton.Without a doubt, THE POSTMAN has some great cinematography in places, especially in the sweeping vistas and magnificent landscapes it often uses as a backdrop. Yet the special effects are kept to a bare minimum, thus alienating the young thrill-seeking crowd, and after the blood-and-thunder of the likes of Mel Gibson's BRAVEHEART, audiences weren't expecting this off beat, slow-paced and preachy epic. I didn't hate it as much as some, but I did find it hard to keep up the energy of watching it in places. Probably the best aspect of the story is its originality, but this frequently means taking the tale into unsatisfying areas. Not a total failure, but that running time is a real killer for this kind of story.",The Postman
1,SnoopyStyle,like the idea but so many problems,4,18 May 2015,"It's 2013. The world is desolated after wars. A man with no name (Kevin Costner) travels the American west with his donkey Bill. He tries to avoid any civilization. He's performing in a settlement when the Holnists led by General Bethlehem (Will Patton) come demanding ""Pure Blood"" recruits. The man is taken, his donkey is killed and he's given the name Shakespeare. He escapes and finds a mail truck. He wears the uniform and takes the mailbag. He uses the 15 year old letters to con his way into Pineview pretending to represent a restored federal government. He is overwhelmed by the town's hopes. Ford Lincoln Mercury is taken by him and begs to be sworn in as a postman. Sheriff Briscoe is suspicious and kicks him out. Abby and Michael can't have children. They decide to have Abby conceive a child with the postman.I really like the idea of communication reviving civilization. If only the movie stuck with that simple idea. Not to mention the fearsome three hours running time. Like Waterworld, this has a lot of goofy post-apocalyptic ideas that take the seriousness out of the movie. The Holnists should lose some of the silliness while maintaining the dark menace. Abby and Michael should be much more simplified. Trying to romanticize Abby and the postman is a fool's errant. It would so much better to have a single Abby falling for the postman. I like Ford Lincoln Mercury's story but not his name. The movie needs to simplify and shorten the plot. It has some great sentimental melodrama but it's destroyed by the overlong overwrought silliness.",The Postman
2,gavin6942,"Gunfire, Cannons or Snow... The Mail Must Get Through",7,4 September 2006,"This film is most popular among women under the age of 18. I can't really fathom why that would be, but maybe there's a whole other aspect of this that I missed.In 2013, the United States has been destroyed for about 15 years, and only the very basic technology is available. Something like the Civil War, but with machine guns. After escaping an army and pretending to be a postman, Kevin Costner sets out to rebuild America.The only bad thing I can say about this film is that some of the actors were really poor. Two or three of the minor roles had very hammy actors that ruined the scenes, but overall the acting was quite well done.The plot is wonderful. Certain plot holes exist if you pay attention (I noticed for example that everyone knows the president is in Minneapolis, although the only time Costner said this was in private to the enemy) but the overall premise of rebuilding through the use of communication is somewhat realistic and a very intriguing idea if nothing else.The woman playing Abby was great, maybe even greater than she was in ""Rushmore"" (though that film reigns supreme). The kid playing Ford Lincoln Mercury was a bit over the top, but it seemed to fit his character well. And Will Patton? A dazzling display of pure evil. As he himself says, great men make great men -- his evilness only serves to make Costner a greater hero.The music was very odd (""Come and Get Your Love""?) and needed more Tom Petty. Petty himself needed a bigger role, and did great with the part that was given to him.Some people will complain the film is too long (178 minutes). While I agree the film seemed long at first, once I became engrossed in the film, I would have been willing to watch another two hours of this world. You really don't want to say goodbye to Abby, the Postman or even to General Bethlehem. They are powerful and charismatic characters.Could this film be even better than ""Waterworld""? I am undecided, but it is certainly in the running as the best Kevin Costner film ever made.",The Postman
3,jboothmillard,The Postman,3,13 March 2009,"I had heard about this film purely because it is known as one of the biggest high budget film flops in Hollywood history, I just had to see why, from Razzie winning actor-director Kevin Costner. It is the year 2013, civilisation has destroyed itself and there is no government, and people are struggling to survive against starvation and armed rogue groups, one of which being the Holnists, led by the delusional General Bethlehem (Entrapment's Will Patton). Many men are kidnapped by the groups, forced to become soldiers, including a drifter (Razzie winning Costner) who manages to escape. He hides in an abandoned jeep, where he finds a skeleton wearing a postal uniform, and also a mailbag full of undelivered letters, so donning the uniform, he cons his way into a small village posing as ""The Postman"", and representative of a restored United States. He isn't believed by people for a while, but admirers and followers soon follow him with his faith in humanity, he becomes quite a famous man in fact, and they soon prepare to go against the Holnists and bring them down. Also starring Larenz Tate as Ford Lincoln Mercury, Olivia Williams as Abby, James Russo as Idaho, Tom Petty as Bridge City Mayor, Daniel Von Bargen as Pineview Sheriff Briscoe and Lost in Translation's Giovanni Ribisi as Bandit 20. It doesn't feel like one of those that should be one star out of five, but I can agree the film should have been cut down from two hours fifty minutes, it does get a little boring after Costner has delivered the letter that gets him on his way, and I do wonder how this film could cost $100 million to make? It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Original Song for the entire song score and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated the Worst Picture of the Decade. Adequate!",The Postman
4,dbborroughs,Painfully bloated and overlong,3,12 February 2005,"Why is this film three hours? More to the point why does anyone think this film should be three hours? The mind boggles.This is the story of a ""postman"" who accidentally begins to bring America back after its destruction. The problem is that the simple delivery of the mail doesn't sit well with the gangs that control the wastelands and the set out to destroy the mail carriers.And it goes on for three hours through every cliché about the end of the world imaginable but with an A list star and some of the worst sequences in any film in the genre.Its painful to watch simply because it never ends.Avoid this film, its just bad",The Postman
5,anaconda-40658,Deliver This to the Land Fill.,2,15 March 2016,"The Postman (1997): Dir: Kevin Costner / Cast: Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Olivia Williams, James Russo, Tom Petty: Kevin Costner's flimsy follow up to Dances With Wolves with a theme regarding hope with mail carrying as a reference. Story regards towns isolated due to an army led by Will Patton. Costner plays a drifter who is taken prisoner. He escapes and finds refuge in a jeep where a skeleton and mailbag reside. He puts on the uniform in hopes that it will grant him a meal in the next town. He encounters a man who begs him to pregnant his wife so that they may have a child. Of course this man will be murdered so that Costner can move in anyway. Meanwhile Patton orders that every mail carrier be killed. Preposterous setup leads to unintentional humour that works like a bag of sh*t under your Christmas tree. This all ends with Costner and Patton pounding the snot out of each other and we are suppose to cheer it on despite its absurdity. Olivia Williams plays his childless mate whose prime purpose is to get banged without a rubber. James Russo is also featured as her husband whose purpose is to be expendable so that Costner can voice his superiority. Musician Tom Petty makes an appearance although one wonders how old he is at this point. Terrible and embarrassing epic that never had a chance of actually working. It is a laughable misfire by all involved. Score: 2 / 10",The Postman
6,FlashCallahan,First Class recorded delivery....,7,9 May 2016,"The Postman is one of those films that supposedly destroyed an A-listers career.For some reason, Costner has always been a target of critics, and despite the fact that in the early nineties, he was one of the big players thanks to the like of The Bodygaurd, Robin Hood and Dances with Wolves, we all tend to remember him for Waterworld, Wyatt Earp, and this, which is unarguably nothing more than a vanity project for it's star/Director.But i've always been a fan of Costner, and I would watch him in a film where he reads the dictionary..Set three years ago, after war has destroyed most of USA, including the government, a lone drifter is captured by a fascist group called the Holnists led by General Bethlehem.When he escapes, he finds a mail Jeep and uniform, and starts to travel through small cities, telling them he is a postman, a representative of the restored United States.No one believes him at first, but soon he has followers, and they start to prepare a revolt against Holnists.......With this being a post apocalyptic vision of the recent past/future depending on when you actually see the film, I for one was actually surprised as to just how light hearted the film was in some scenes.What Costner has given us is nothing more than Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves meets Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, as The Postman has the same traits and problems as Hood.Now take away Patton (even though he is very good), and add Rickman, I would guarantee that this would have been better received, and more regarded today.I wouldn't have been surprised if the late actor was sent a script, but didn't want to steal the show from Costner yet again.So he escapes from the General, starts a movement, gets injured, spends a winter with Olivia Willaims, and fights some more, until we have a Braveheart type finale.The film is all over the place, Costner clearly believed he had the answers to the meaning of life with this film, and was betting that he would repeat his success with Dances With Wolves.It's not a bad film by any means, it's actually quite entertaining, and my advice is make your own decisions, you will find something to enjoy.Even if it is for all the wrong reasons.",The Postman

8,JamesHitchcock,Idealistic Post-Apocalyptic Epic,8,27 March 2006,"The ""just war"" theory  the doctrine that under certain circumstances force may legitimately be used in support of a good cause- underlies many of Hollywood's most popular offerings, not just straightforward war films but also blockbusters such as the ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogies. Hollywood's predominantly liberal elite, however, are often slightly uncomfortable with the doctrine; in the eighties many were at pains to point out that, whatever President Reagan might have thought, the ""evil empire"" in ""Star Wars"" was not to be equated with the Soviet Union, and more recently it has been denied that ""Lord of the Rings"" offers any tacit support to Bush's war in Iraq.Kevin Costner is sometimes regarded as one of Hollywood's more politically conservative figures, so it was therefore somewhat surprising to see him as the director, producer and star of a post-apocalyptic epic that explicitly rejects the just war doctrine in favour of a more pacifist view. The film is set in 2013 after a devastating nuclear war. Civilisation in America has collapsed and there is no more central authority. The survivors of the catastrophe live a quasi-mediaeval lifestyle in scattered agricultural settlements. The area in which the film is set (Oregon/Idaho/Utah) is dominated by a powerful warlord, General Bethlehem (the name is presumably an ironic joke) and his private army. Bethlehem and his men subscribe to a quasi-Nazi ideology known as ""Holnism"". They are explicitly racist, exalt strength and power as the supreme good and despise mercy and compassion towards the weak.Costner plays a travelling actor (we never learn his real name) who makes his living by travelling from one community to another to entertain the people with performances of Shakespeare. He is conscripted into the Holnist army, but manages to escape He finds the uniform and mailbag of a dead pre-war postman and appropriates these in order to pass himself off as an official of a ""Restored United States"", charged with a mission by the non-existent ""President Richard Starkey"" to restore the postal service in the American West. To his surprise, Costner finds that he is taken seriously, and local people volunteer to set up a new postal service to restore communication between their scattered communities. By doing so, however, they incur the enmity of the Holnists who see any restored central government or quasi-governmental agency as a threat to their own power and control of the area.The film appears to be leading up to a final showdown between the Holnists and the idealistic young men and women who have volunteered for the new postal service. There is, however, a surprising ending as Costner finds a way of resolving the conflict without all-out war. It was war which led to the collapse of civilisation; the best way of rebuilding it is not through the military heroism of taking on the bad guys at their own game, or even through the high culture symbolised by the Shakespeare recitations of the early scenes (Bethlehem himself turns out to be surprisingly cultured), but rather through the patient reconstruction of the amenities of ordinary civil society represented by the postal service. The symbolism of the postman is that he is a uniformed government servant, but one who carries no weapons and fights no battles.There are some similarities between this film and another anti-war post-apocalyptic drama, ""The Omega Man"" from the early seventies. Like Costner's character in ""The Postman"", Robert Neville, the character played by Charlton Heston in the earlier film, was a man who brought a message of hope to a community trying to survive in the aftermath of a devastating war and fighting off attacks from a fanatical brotherhood. Neville, however, was deliberately presented as a Christ-figure, an analogy that is never explicitly drawn in ""The Postman"". The look of the two films is also different, ""The Omega Man"" being set in the ruins of a deserted city, ""The Postman"" in idyllic Western scenery with pine-clad mountains. Costner's favourite film genre (and the one in which he achieved his greatest success with ""Dances with Wolves"") is the Western, and ""The Postman"", despite being set in the future, is very close to a traditional Western in feel.One thing which I have never been able to fathom is why this film should have aroused so much hostile comment from the critics and on this board. The organisers of that rather spiteful institution the ""Razzie Awards"" voted it not only the worst film of 1997 (beating genuine rubbish such as ""Anaconda"" to the award) but also the worst film of the decade. Perhaps some of the problem lies with Costner himself. He seems to have a well-developed Messiah complex, which may irritate some of his critics; in a number of his films, going back at least as far as ""Field of Dreams"", he has portrayed either idealistic characters bringing a message of hope to the world or legendary heroes such as his version of Wyatt Earp. It is also possible that the failure of ""Waterworld"", a genuinely bad film, may have prejudiced the critics against another futuristic Costner epic.""The Postman"", however, is not ""Waterworld"". Not only is it not a bad film, it is a positively good one. Costner's acting may be an acquired taste, but for me he is one of the few modern actors with a genuine epic sense and the ability to convey the heroic. (He has this in common with Heston, another actor who often had something messianic about him). ""Dances with Wolves"" is his best effort in this heroic vein, but ""The Postman"" is, along with ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Wyatt Earp"", another successful venture into the epic style. (He receives good support here from Will Patton as the fanatical neo-fascist Bethlehem). Certainly, his message of peace and reconciliation is an idealistic one, but idealism in the cinema is not always suspect. 8/10",The Postman
9,MovieAddict2016,Poor Kevin.,4,26 September 2005,"Like all futuristic/post-apocalyptic action movies, ""The Postman"" opens up with people dressing like they did in the 1800s. Kevin Costner looks like he rode in off the set of ""Dances for Wolves"" seven years late.The year is 2013, the world is a mess and its inhabitants have destroyed their land. A crippling war has taken place, we are led to believe, which has killed the government. So, it makes sense that instead of just Americans being left hopeless, the entire world is affected, too. Gotta love Hollywood.Anyway, this group of outlaws called Hedonists or something captures Kevin Costner and he's forced to join their group (don't ask why, maybe they're gay). He escapes and finds a skeleton with a postal uniform and takes it to keep warm. He also finds a mailbag with letters and begins to trick people into thinking the letters are for them.But soon he feels sympathetic towards them and decided to take on the Hedonists once and for all! (Gotta love manipulative plots.) Kevin Costner is so bad in this movie and this movie is so bad for Kevin Costner. The entire script reeks of ""Mad Max"" syndrome, only it's about fifteen years late. It comes across, ultimately, as a very bad rip-off of other - and better - post-apocalyptic movies.When the producers started considering making their hero a postman...well...I think that's when they should have realized they were heading for the gutter.",The Postman
10,ksf-2,long Costner project,6,29 April 2020,"Directed by, produced by, AND starring Kevin Costner, who has had his share of Great films and Not so Great films. his oscars were for Wolves, back in 1990. It's pretty much MadMax. After the apocalypse, the last Postman travels the land, trying to deliver (old) messages from one family member to another. he travels through friendly areas, and he travels through hostile lands, where Bad Things happen... Co-stars Will Patton as ""The General""... Patton had worked with Costner in 1987 in No Way Out. The Postman is pretty good. nothing too new and exciting. all about survival. Gotta mention Tom Petty; he's in here as ""The Mayor"". it's LONG... almost three hours. yeesh. needed to chop here and there to shorten it up. would have moved the action along a little faster.",The Postman

""The Postman"" is a good solid film about the end of the world and the chaos and confusion that follows with the unwitting soul that destiny choose to bring those who survived the apocalypse back to a better life and promising future. Corny yes but in a positive and constructive sort of way. With the cast of Kevin Costner on down giving the film the sort of believability that you just don't see in most of the ""End of he World"" movies that have been projected on the silver screen since ""Things to Come"" back in 1936.""The Postman"" unlike most ""End of the world"" movies carries through the entire movie, which is almost three hours long, a positive and uplifting theme that you rarely get to see in these type of films. The ending of the film, call it corny it you will, was really moving without being obnoxious like it could have been had it been made by a lesser talent then Kevin Costner.",The Postman
12,Robert_duder,One of my favorites!! A guilty little pleasure apparently,9,7 June 2008,"Years ago I watched The Postman when it was first released amidst horrifying reviews. I started watching it late one night with the intention of only watching a bit of it and next thing I knew I was wide eyed and hooked on this patriotic post apocalyptic action flick. Granted I have always been a HUGE Kevin Costner fan (MUST SEE MR BROOKS--See my review.) I watched it again in order to review it and was still impressed although the enormous greatness I saw as a teenager had faded a little. I am pleased to see that a lot of IMDb reviewers see this film for what it is and that some people truly see it as a great flick. It has it's moments of really campy special effects, some major over acting, and a really heavy message of United States patriotism which is apparently a bad thing according to some reviewers?! The problem is in a post 9/11 world a lot of people have had their fill of intense, down your throat patriotism but The Postman did it before it was the fad. It still is a beautifully directed, action packed epic with beautiful landscape and a captivating story and some really honest goodness moving moments. The length is a common complaint and yet the length is what makes The Postman epic compared to run of the mill action flick because it doesn't hold back anything to tell it's story.Kevin Costner directs and stars in the film and he is perfect as a drifter who longs for the days of old when he reluctantly becomes a hero to the entire country. Costner knows how to make a film that you want to watch and he doesn't care whether critics love it or hate it, he makes it for us and thank goodness for that. As The Postman he gives a terrific performance that has a great character arc from drifter to prisoner to hero throughout the film. He is a powerful actor in the role. Will Patton...I don't know what to say about his performance as the evil, over bearing dictator General Bethlehem. In one way he is deliciously evil and terrifying and in another way he is campy and over acting with a huge and ridiculous vocabulary that doesn't quite jive. Either way he is memorable in his role and does appear completely insane. Him and Costner are great foes in the film. Larenz Tate is powerful as the head of the resistance Ford Lincoln Mercury. He doesn't have a huge role and yet his strong performance and truly astounding character patriotism shines through. Olivia Williams is the perfect 80's action love interest...in the late nineties in this case. She's pretty and quiet and not afraid to strip off her clothes for the obligatory breast shot. Her and Costner have decent chemistry but nothing sizzling. She comes across as a little crazy at times but she is decent in the role. She seems kind of bored.So the cast is good, Kevin Costner shines but nothing spectacular in the supporting cast but this film is not about the cast...it's about the story. This is a post apocalyptic film at it's best. It reminds me in a way of Stephen King's Gunslinger...remnants of the old world exist everywhere which really makes you feel like all of this could be a reality which draws you into this world. Seeing The Postman in a world that used to exist...a former gas station, an old car wreck etc. is even more disturbing and real. Costner does an incredible job of direction creating this void of a world where war and technology eliminated everything. Despite horrible reviews and constant belittling I encourage any fan of Sci-Fi or Costner or an epic action film to check this out and see for yourself because this will a film that I will watch again in the future. My guilty little pleasure as I stated because I loved it!! 9/10",The Postman
13,The-Sarkologist,An epic movie that ends up fall flat,4,19 October 2013,"In a sentence this film has a very good background but I found that its execution was a little poor. It was a epic movie yet there was something about it that just did not click with me. Maybe it had to do with the bad guy - he seemed to rule the region, while I would expect that in such a situation as this, there would be numerous bandit kings fighting each other, but even then that was not my problem with the movie. It just did not seem to be that right.The Postman is set in 2013 after a great war and the United States has disintegrated. All that remains are small farming colonies that are dominated by a Bandit King, Bethlahem, who rules the region, the Northwest, with a iron fist. The political code has become might means right, and those who do not submit to Bethlehem's rule will pay the consequences. Into this region comes a man without a name, which is similar to Costner's previous movies: Waterworld and Dances With Wolves. I have not seen the later, but have been told that it runs along a similar themes.Costner is an actor and performs with his mule Bill for food and shelter in the towns he passes through. Unfortunately he gets caught up in Bethlehem's army when he is conscripted while trying to get out of the town unnoticed. Later he manages to escape, but has nothing. Fortune is shining upon him as he finds an old postal van and stays there the night. He then hits upon an idea and decides to deliver the letters, only for a chance to spend the night in a town. He does this, and though the townspeople love him, the sheriff of the town distrusts him, but is still unsure. Thus having cottoned on to a good thing, he decides to bluff his way from town to town. What he doesn't realise is that he has started up something as he makes a young Negro a postman before he leaves.The next town he visits he meets Bethlehem's army and escapes with a woman and is trapped in a valley during winter. When the winter passes he and the woman decide to make their way back to civilisation, if there is any. While they are traveling they meet a young girl who is a postman, and Costner discovers that he has started something which has blossomed out beyond his control. He is now a legendary figure known as the Postman.The theme behind this movie is hope. No matter how dark the times are, there is always hope. This hope comes from the Postman, who in essence is a Christ figure. The world has been destroyed and the only person who seems to offer anything is a bully. Thus when Costner arrives speaking about a restored United States, everybody turns to him. There is a big difference between Christ and the Postman, Christ did not do it for his own benefit, the postman did. In the end, both figures offered hope, it is just the Christ's hope is lasting.I guess this movie shows us that we need hope and this desire for hope will send us following anything to find it. There is one kid in the movie that joins Bethlehem's army believing it to be fulfilling, but it is not. Everybody else follows Costner, though the hope he brings is a lie. The statement made is not that it is a lie, but that he brings hope to people who are looking for it. Those who bring hope bring people to them. This is what happened with Christ - people saw him as providing hope, but many turned away because they could not understand the hope that he offered. Things are different now because many people speak Christ's words for him and distort the truth and thus offer hope. The truth about Christ's hope is that we must be prepared to drop everything to follow him, which is something that many of us are not prepared to do.I guess the problem with the movie is that it was long and the theme is getting a bit stale. I could see potential in the movie, but it just didn't come out as good as it could have. The movie kept me riveted - it was not boring, but still, there was something missing.",The Postman
14,slightlymad22,Hey Public... Don't Be A Sheep!! Watch It And Then Decide,8,2 September 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to The Postman from 1997.Plot In A Paragraph: Whilst living in post-apocalyptic America, a nameless drifter (KC) dons a postman's uniform, and armed with a bag of mail sets out to con his way into various communities, for free food and shelter. As he does this, he accidentally begins to inspire hope to others. Any goodwill KC earned with Tin Cup was well and truly gone, by the time this movie was released. Mocked as a vanity project during its production, and greeted to savage reviews, including being labelled ""Dances With Myself"" The Postman never stood a chance, as critics and and the press had a field day, and the public listened to them staying away in droves. Is it perfect?? Far from it. For starters I think it could use some trimming here and there. Maybe if it was an hour shorter it would not have been so savagely reviewed and may have found more of an audience. Because for this reviewer all of the performances are good, it's well directed and has a good score. But sadly, I'd reviewers say stay away, the public behave like sheep and generally listen. I think some people who bash this movie have not actually seen it.",The Postman
15,filipemanuelneto,"It entertains, but it is very long and has several faults.",5,25 April 2018,"This film takes place in 2013, at a time when the World was destroyed by the Third World War. Communities have become isolated, there is no government, United States seems to have disappeared and armed militias on horseback are oppressing the people. However, a man will change that when, somewhat accidentally, it triggers a movement of resistance to oppression.The center of all history is the way a man, with no name but who is nicknamed ""Shakespeare"" due to his survival as an artist and itinerant declamer, ends up giving rise to a movement of resistance to a strong and fierce armed militia, when he disguises himself as a postman to be able to receive help from the people, averse to the visit of strangers. He comes to be seen as a symbol of hope when he lies, assuming himself as a representative of a Restored Government, which does not even know whether it exists or not.The central idea is great, and the film is interesting by the ideas it presents and by the good work of the leading actors, Kevin Costner and Will Patton. The two actors worked well and their characters are very interesting. Costner gave life to a hero by chance, full of internal conflicts and a complex psychology that he managed to explore; Patton was an insensitive and bloodthirsty villain, cultured but cruel. The sub-plot created between the Postman and Abby turns out little and does not seem very happy by the way she quickly forgets her husband. But worse are the three hours lenght, which are not justified by the plot and denounce a bad post-production and editing work. There's a lot left in this movie and lots of details that don't matter and should have been taken off. Another problem is the time when everything is happening: the year 2013. Okay, the movie was shot in 1997, but we're in 2018 today, and it seems silly that they thought of a future so near as something so apocalyptic. The film should have been thought for 2113, not 2013.Despite all the flaws, the film is interesting and tells a good story of freedom, resistance to oppression and tyranny, survival and companionship.

16,Tweetienator,Not Epic but Good,7,19 June 2019,"The Postman got a lot of harsh and bad reviews and for that reason I didn't watch it at the cinema. After a couple of years I got it on DVD and was surprised - yes, The Postman is no masterpiece, but still a very entertaining one, if you like the post-apocalyptic genre.All in all The Postman got some lengths here and there (no wonder, running time is 177 minutes) and the end (fight) is a little bit disappointing, but all in all, The Postman is a good watch with good production, acting and some good action.My advice - if you like the genre and didn't already watch The Postman, just take your chances and give it a try.",The Postman
17,damianphelps,Better Than You Would Be Led To Believe,7,6 March 2021,"This is Costner's second attempt at the 'man who will save us role' and like the first one (Waterworld) I liked it.The Postman received a lot of criticism (as did WW) again for being a little self indulgent. Its the third film (WW and Wolves) that shows Costner has no idea how to edit. If he shoots it, its in the movie!That issue aside, the Postman sets up a great 'world' with some nice characters as it explores the denigration of humanity. Another plus is the dealing with a post apocalyptic world without replicating anything Mad Maxish, the same challenge for movies delving in archaeology and Indiana Jones. Its hard not to be accused of being a clone and the Postman does that pretty well :)",The Postman
18,funkyfry,Costner & Co. create absurd and grandiose epic,7,11 November 2015,"Well, I really put off watching this one for quite a long time, having just given it a first chance at long last. Not quite love at first sight, but the early scenes in the film have a quiet majesty and intrigue about them that's hard to deny. Costner's performance has a real core, and as the film expands in scope to include dozens of characters in an epic post-apocalyptic sprawl, Costner in his role as director generously allows the actors to really inhabit the space, creating strong characters nearly across the board.It's a long film, and it has several distinct sections with different mood: the early laconic wanderer, then the bitter prisoner on a wild escape, and eventually we get Costner as a revolutionary organizing young people into ad-hoc postal committees to spread information and propaganda against the sadistic fascist regime of Bethlehem (Will Patton). The later parts of the film have a sort of ""Red Dawn"" vibe about them, with almost as much nationalistic flag-waving as Milius' film but less of a pro-military attitude. Costner takes his themes and his story seriously, which is admirable and certainly ambitious, but the whole thing is really too sentimental, particularly in the denouement. He has this obsession with slow- motion close-ups of people riding on horses past other people..... just cuz it looked cool in ""Dances With Wolves"" doesn't mean he needs to do it in every other shot. Although I'm sure her presence in the film did young Olivia Williams no good, her performance is credible and, again, Costner deserves praise for moving over and letting her steal a lot of their scenes together. Paxton is fascinating, but ultimately not gripping enough to be a great movie villain. It's a unique film in the post-apocalyptic genre because it has a lot more focus on character and mood than just about anything else I've seen, at least up to its time.",The Postman

23,Samiam3,Postal Service is slow in Costner's hands,6,15 August 2010,"If this motion picture does one thing, it will probably remind you of the value of email. Speed and efficiency are two things that postal service lack, as does Kevin Costner's second post- apocalyptic epic (the first being Waterworld). Though his performance here is a step up from his over done portrayal of a half-man half-fish, everything else in this motion picture is a step down, starting with the most obvious problem; its pacing. The Postman doesn't work simply because it is too damn long. Parts of it are entertaining, but the story is draggy, inconsistent and is not involving at all. It is a terrible movie? no, but it is in desperate need of a make over.The year is 2013, and American Union has crumbled. A lone wanderer in the Utah territory gets drafted in the the army of the Tyrant General Bethelham, who is the closest thing to government in the former land of the free. On the day our lonely hero escapes, he discovers an abandoned mail truck, and decides to rebuild postal service, as a way to bring the nation back together. In doing so, he is putting himself in danger of Bethelham. As the postal service begins to expand, the chances of a war grow ever more possible.I was expecting a bit more adrenaline from this movie. I guess I have myself to blame for that, considering I was expecting more of an action/adventure. This is essentially a drama with some western tones. Quite frankly, not even the idea is that appealing, which would certainly explain why this movie flopped. Who wants to pay to see a three hour movie about a guy running a kingdom of postal service?Despite such feeble characterization, the acting is not too bad. The best performance is turned in by Will Patton, who is smart enough not to overplay, his character type, 'the tyrannical bully'. Even though he doesn't look it, he brings a bit of mannerism to the role, yet when necessary he can also bring rage.Some aspects work, some don't, but in the end The Postman ends up falling kind of flat.

The nameless hero is an intentional one, changing from an uncaring scavenger, getting into a postman's uniform, to unintentionally inspiring hope for youngsters and eventually a large group of men. Kevin Costner's action is nice. He can portray the uncaring initial persona of his role, mostly with his facial expressions, and then the protective hero carrying the burden of lies. Will Patton succeeded in portraying the stern and strict yet coward inside general. Larenz Tate and Olivia Williams give the color this movie needs.

26,chrichtonsworld,The Postman is nearly as good as Dances with Wolves,9,29 March 2009,"""The Postman"" is a movie I have avoided for years. For two reasons. The post-apocalyptic theme is the first reason and the second is the bad reputation that is attached to this movie. After having seen this movie I can honestly say that this movies deserves a lot more. Especially if you compare it to movies with similar themes. If you compare this to ""Waterworld"" than ""The Postman"" is a big improvement in storytelling and character development. I do have a hunch why most viewers didn't like this movie. And that is the lack of action. With a movie that is 3 hours long you expect a lot to happen. And a lot does happen only on a complete another level. The story in fact is very simple. (SPOILER!) In the gloomy dark world there is someone who appears who gives hope to people. (END SPOILER) The moment you get introduced to the bad guy you expect Costner to take him on and rebel against him. And he does so only not in the way he did in ""Waterworld"". As heroes go he takes a more realistic approach. This doesn't mean there is no action to be enjoyed,there is just enough. But probably nearly not enough to satisfy the viewer who expected some serious action scenes a la Mad Max. To me ""The Postman"" is a very moving drama that has a theme that is universal even when this movie seems to be a bit patriotic. (But I believe that Costner just made an example of what have could been any other country in similar situation). Overall this movie offers a very positive look on humanity which is refreshing to see especially considering the genre.",The Postman
27,brchthethird,"Self-indulgent and silly, but watchable",5,5 April 2015,"Let me preface this by saying that I didn't go into this expecting anything, but I'd have to have been living under a rock to not know how critically reviled this was when it was released. However, I don't quite understand why people hate it so much. Is it a great (even good) film? Not really, but Kevin Costner really shot for the moon with this one and even though he missed by quite a lot, you have to admire something with such ambition. The story is set in the post-apocalyptic America of...2013. Having been ravaged by a massive war, civilization has been reduced back to small settlements in a sort-of feudal system run by a renegade army that is led by a ""general"" (Will Patton) who plunders from every town he visits. Kevin Costner plays a nameless drifter who, by circumstance, becomes an inspiration and symbol of hope for the restoration of society as they once knew it. What the film gets right, and there are a number of things, is its portrayal of a society in decay. Things aren't quite ""Mad Max"" bad, but the world which Costner created in the film was fairly believable. Another thing was the epic scope of the film. Even though THE POSTMAN is, at times, self-indulgent and a little too long, little was wasted in terms of visual spectacle. There were plenty of breathtaking shots which captured the American West as only Costner (and a few others) can. In terms of characters and acting, given the length of the film, adequate screen time was allotted to suitably develop the principal characters, and the performances given by all were quite good. Still, some of the dialogue they were saddled with (pardon my pun) was cliché at best, laughable at worst. In fact, most of the moments which were supposed to emotionally hit you came off as silly to me. Not only that, but they played it straight and so unironically that it came off that much more silly. Overall, THE POSTMAN aims high in terms of scope and themes, but only delivers satisfactorily on the technical side of things.

29,The_Movie_Cat,"""I'm clapping because you stink!""",4,26 November 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
The Postman is a much-disparaged film, and has a lot in common with Waterworld. Like that film, it's overlong, overwrought and overpriced. Yet also like Waterworld it's really not all that bad. Nothing special, just a plainly average film paid undue attention due to its $80 million budget and panned as a result.Its formula: initial violent clash, romance with gratuitous sex scene, conflict, love and resolution is nothing new. The murder of Olivia Williams' husband merely exists to serve the plot, and using her rape as a character motivation is deplorable. However, in its initial stages things are actually almost watchable, and while Costner isn't the world's greatest director, he's not the worst either.Things take a dip as soon as Costner takes on the postman mantle, where every letter he delivers is a written piece of exposition. The Mad Max references are obvious, though there are some reasonable allegories in the text. And where Max itself was inspired by ""man with no name"" western idents, so too Costner's titular character has only ""Shakespeare"" as a moniker.An oddity is the fact that the advertising billboards give us the year in which it's set as 2013, yet this is never revealed on screen. Rather odd that to discover major plot points you don't have to watch the film, but look at the marketing. Into this Costner emerges as a saviour in a post-apocalyptic America. The ""back to basics"" stance isn't always subtle. In one scene Costner's battered hero lets out a series of guttural groans as he discovers a cigarette lighter  a parody of the caveman discovering fire. The humour is also a little naive, with the postman falsely claiming that the president is Ringo Starr and his policies come from Sgt.Pepper lyrics. Yet Costner's unsure delivery (no pun intended) lends them a sort of feckless charm.However, his postman guise must be effective because as soon as he dons the cap and shaves he becomes completely unrecognisable to Will Patton. Patton co-stars as a hard case villain who can beat large men in six second fights, sets fire to American flags and cuts off tongues and testicles. Of course, it's a little hard to believe that a redheaded balding beardie is so tough so most of this is revealed via dialogue. While not a bad actor, the one-note, singular dynamic of the role does start to get rather tiresome. ""Take two character dimensions into the shower? Not me!"" Larenz Tate, making an appearance as the token black kid in a Hollywood movie, reaches Sunset Boulevard levels of screen realism. Choke back on them crocodile tears, son. And somebody get Tom Petty some acting lessons, for God's sake!While the first half of this film is so-so entertainment, the conclusion sees it's ultimate distillation into overearnest sentimentality. In fact, it's often so extreme it makes The Sha, er, Patriot seem underplayed. Costner talks about ""beating back vomit, er, despair, and replacing it with hope"" as teary-eyed, impossibly white-teethed youngsters salute and look on with patriotic pride. Silly quotes, er, soliloquies abound, with Costner being told ""you give out hope like it was candy in your pocket."" Just when you think you can't heave your guts up any more, Costner gets a daughter... named Hope. Mind you, he was lucky to get Olivia pregnant after just one attempt.In fact, I dunno why I started reappraising it now, as it's rubbish, really, ain't it? The sort of mealy-mouthed, sentimental/gung-ho tripe, so saccharine it will give you the cinematic equivalent of tooth decay. And didn't you just know the film would end with a slug match between Costner and Patton? I mean, I'm soft, but I could have him, no problem. Probably the stumbling block with this review was that I made the mistake of taking down notes and thoughts at the half-way point. Every time I wrote ""it's not that bad"" something would happen to make me realise it really IS that bad. Still, I've seen worse. Not very often, but I have... I think... 4/10.",The Postman

Costner wasn't a bad choice for the lead. The support characters were hit and miss. I honestly felt they spent too much money.

34,bopdog,"Critics missed the point, there's a gem of a movie in here",7,20 August 1999,"""Bum rap"" is right-- while this movie does indeed have its flaws (duh-- most do)-- it was considerably better than the Hollywood establishment allowed. In fact, it was unseemly the way those folks sought the movie out for criticism. They chased it, practically, for derision! I became a fan accidentally, innocently. I had a few friends who worked as extras in the filming, and it was filmed on location, mostly, in my home town area in Eastern Washington. Thus, I schlepped my bod over to the theater on Christmas day to see it. I was away at school, and lonesome. I felt cut-off from friends and family-- blah blah blah. Thus I sat in the dark searching the screen for my friends, feeling a bit of ""old home"" vibe returning as a I saw scene after scene take place in recognized locales. This is what the movie was about-- the re-connecting that takes place after a time of separation. The theme of the movie was about finding the courage it takes to crawl out of our shells, to deny the relative safety of living withdrawn and contracted. It was all about community, and the personal risks and steps necessary to reconnect and reestablish our communities. It was about the virtual death that living without community is, and the inexorable force of human nature and life itself that propels us to-- eventually-- do whatever it takes to reach back out again and find our interpersonal and social relationships. Well, my little episode of homesickness, and the reaffirming activity I was engaged in while trying to find old friends in old familiar places on screen drew me instantly into what I believe was the underlying purpose of the book, and the movie. I was stunned, awe struck, gratified, and immensely happy and comforted by the movie. Only later I was shocked to discover how much the media folks hated it, and how indifferent the movie going public seemed to be to it. A year+ later I saw the movie again, and some of the emotional impact for me had faded. I could see that the evil general and the Holnist Army thing was a bit overdrawn-- but the essential sweetness and power of the core message was intact. As humans, when we live cut off from our fellow folks, we're as good as dead; it is only through exercising and feeding our relationships that we can be human, happy, and alive. If I had a time machine, I'd go back and get Kevin Costner to cut the ""army of 8"" stuff WAY back. I'd also get him to NOT direct the thing-- focus on the townspeople and their ""coming out"" relationships and experiences a touch more. And I'd make sure he cut the length down to 135 mins or so. I'd also stick in a reference or three to the ""postman"" theme-- have some person or other comment on the corny nature, perhaps, of having a postman save the word-- making a knowing joke about it within the story might then have the effect of inoculating the audience against their own cynicism. To paraphrase David Denby of ""The New Yorker,"" it seems as if Hollywood is punishing Costner for making them feel things they didn't want to feel. Over all, I gave it a 9.",The Postman
35,jayraskin1,The Best Post Apocalypse Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,14 April 2013,"I am glad that 15 out of the last 20 reviewers over the last two years have given this movie 6 stars or above. As the wicked hatchet job the professional critics did on the movie when it first came out in 1997 gets forgotten, I believe more and more people will discover just how brilliant and classic this film is and 3/4ths of people who see it will enjoy it.In the year 2013, after an apocalypse, only small bands of isolated, frightened humans are still alive in the western United States. Apparently all electricity and electrical communication is gone. People are suspicious of each other and live in fortress-like towns. Loner Costner discovers an old mail truck with a dead mailman inside. He takes the clothes of the mailman and carries his mailbag filled with mail. Desperately needing food, he approaches the guards at the gate of a nearby town and tells them that he is a postman appointed by the new President of the United States, Richard Starkey, from Minnesota to deliver mail. The people of the town believe his story and are excited that civilization is starting again. One of the town's young men demands that Costner tell him how he can become a postman like him. Costner appoints him the postman for the town. The town's sheriff discovers Costner's deception and kicks him out of town.The following year, Costner returns again. He is astonished to find a fully functioning post office with dozens of new postmen and women delivering mail to different towns in the region. Costner gets welcomed back as a hero and nearly a God. Everyone now believes Costner's fable about the United States starting up again and the new president living in Minnesota. Costner's great lies about a new country starting are ironically actually causing a new country to be started.Why did the movie get such bad reviews? It believe it was because of the movie's ideology. I think the extreme negative reaction was only because the movie presented the idea that total lies can be believed and start new movements. It is an offensive thought for many true believers. The hero, Kevin Costner, makes up a fabulous lie. It leads to a new cult centered around him.The movie at one point makes the connection to Christian ideology transparent. Costner asks his companion Abbey why everybody believes the nonsense he made up. She answers, ""You made Mrs. March feel like she could see again. You made Ford believe he was part of something. You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket."" If you like Westerns or Science Fiction or just thoughtful movies, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

I thought it was excellent from start to finish and very well paced. Usually I'm the kind of person the notice when a film is longer than 2 hours, but this one didn't have me checking my watch at any point during the film.I thought the story was a quite interesting take on the whole post-apocalyptic world.  At first I thought the idea of a mail-service of sorts starting up any kind of feud between two groups was just absurd, but I have to hand it to the writers and director Kevin Costner, it was done extremely well in this film and works very well.As far as acting goes, I thought everyone did an excellent job in the film and showed a great deal of emotion in their scenes.  I thought Kevin Costner did a particularly good job in ""The Postman"", as did Daniel von Bargen, Olivia Williams, Larenz Tate and Will Patton.  Will Patton was definitely a bright star in the film, I couldn't believe this is the same guy from ""Armageddon"".  His character is a truly sick individual in the film and Will does a phenomenal job showing it.  Personally, I thought he was a perfect choice for the role of General Bethlehem.In all honesty, I thought this was a better film than ""Dances With Wolves"", but I must admit that I've only seen ""Dances With Wolves"" once or maybe twice and don't remember a great deal about it.

Even the tumultuous production of the record-budgeted Waterworld resulted in a positive balance-sheet for the studio, so why not keep a good thing going?

In Dances With Wolves, it was an adopted people and identity. Here it is a messianic mission, to unite remote communities through written mail against a tyrannical oppressor. Whereas Wolves was a perfect storm of harmonious parts, Postman is handicapped from the start by a number of fatal flaws.The first flaw is conceptual: given the earnest tone Costner goes for, the choice of a Postman as a messianic figure could not have struck a worse cord with audiences around the world, where hardly any culture views mailmen as the epitome of courage, competence or decency. It might be unfair, but it results in a huge negative bias against the protagonist and the film from the get-go.The second flaw is the result of an artist misunderstanding his own strengths. At around 4 hours, Dances With Wolves was a huge success, commercially and critically. But rather than create a compelling story and allowing it to play out at the required pace, Costner turns that logic on its head, seemingly intent on crafting a 3 hour opus and then worrying about content. This makes it come across as a much longer, slower experience than his earlier film. These two main flaws would still allow the Postman to become an interesting misfire, even one with fine touches, but the end product is an embarrassment beyond measure.The screenplay, bafflingly written by Brian ""LA Confidential"" Helgeland and frequent Michael Mann collaborator Eric Roth, is a complete disgrace, a pileup of predictable, derivative ""set-pieces"" and cringe-worthy dialogue, the crown jewel among stiff competition being ""You give out hope like it was candy in your pocket"". Say what you want about the Razzie Awards, this kind of thing is the reason they exist in the first place, and so they logically awarded it a trophy for worst script (one many the film justly earned).The performances are bland almost by design, as if Costner resented Dennis Hopper for stealing Waterworld from under his feet. No chance of the spotlight getting stolen this time around, with even capable veterans hung out to dry, and villain duties passed on to a very forgettable Will Patton. These are all lethal handicaps for a supposed epic.Having ensured that the film's grandeur would not stem from the human element, Costner also fails in conjuring any visual poetry: not only is the cinematography as bland as the characters, a feat in itself for a film of this scale, but the action is poorly staged and even more badly edited. Even the great James Newton Howard, able to find poetry in the worst flop even on a bad day, fails to deliver a merely serviceable score. It says a lot about your prospects as a director when you just bring out the worst in everyone, an ability Costner transcends in the worst way imaginable by taking part in the dreadful closing song.The Postman was the worst film of the year despite hard competition from the likes of Batman and Robin, Speed 2 and Anaconda, all eclipsed by the epic arrogance of this particular dud. Even the worst sort of patriotism managed to save its performance on US soil, and that's saying something, and though Costner learned a lesson or two as evidenced by the admirable Open Range, his own career never truly recovered.As bad a film as you can come across outside the limits of IMDb's Bottom 100, where in truth it all to much belongs.",The Postman
41,nightroses,Sick bucket film,1,7 December 2020,This film is one of the worst I've seen. The idea of a post apocalypse recovering back to civilisation all thanks to a post bag sounds like a comedy. Yet this was serious and filled with sickening American patriotism. Yawn.,The Postman
42,flingebunt,A brave failure,6,6 January 2006,"The post apocalyptic genre is one of the hardest to get right. Movie history is full of unwatchable failures. More importantly, it seems much easier to get right in book form, but once you dress them up in the costumes suspension of disbelief is not really possible.The postman is based on a book by one America's greatest Science Fiction writers. The book tells the story of an English literature major who saves the world. The book is a 3 way battle between Anarcy (The Holnists), Dictatorship (Bethlehem's Holnists) and Community (The Postal system).With such a large and complicated book adapting it to the screen is difficult and the result is a brave failure, where the confrontation is now between 2 elements rather than one.But it remembers the core story. The Postman is a symbol of America, and of course everyone knows, don't anger a postman or he is likely to grab a gun and starting shooting people. It is around this symbol of America people begin rebuilding America.This is not fantasy, in the middle societies that have broken down return to Islamic law. It is a basis of their society and something bigger than any leader or government.This story is told in Kevin Constner's typical directorial, style, with long and laboured. It worked well with Dances with Wolves, and is OK here. I guess it is one those movies that is worth seeing if you like the genre, though most people have hated this movie.",The Postman

44,rollernerd,"Neither Snow, Nor Rain, Nor Descent to Anarchy",6,16 September 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the epic war drama The Postman (1997), based on a fictional novel, directed and starring the likeable Kevin Costner who adapts the novel into a flick of epic proportions, both in terms of storytelling in a hefty running time of close to 3 hours.The film is based in a dystopian world where America has been left in ruins in the wake of a doom war and how a dystopian dictatorship falls at the hands of the United States Postal Service. That's right, in this post-apocalyptic land, the land of the free is represented by postal carriers. The film is based in 2013 and the county has fallen and divided by the hands of some farmer who we never see but constantly hear of, the charismatic Nathan Holn who rose to power with his book 'Seizing the Way to Win."" This bloke preaches violence, racism and brings a misogynist populist message. The collective who follows this system and lead by the example of Holn are called The Holness, a ruthless military group, led by the unforgiving vicious General Bethlehem. This militia eventually overthrow the Whitehouse and the United States Government.We come across a loner drifter who performs Shakespeare plays just he can have food in stomach. This loner drifter is played by Costner - and his character does not have a name. The film at the get go is narrated by his daughter, so this whole story has already happened. The mystery character has his mule friend and sometimes pretends he watches Days Of Our Lives. That is until The Holness find him and attempt to turn him into one of them. After his escape, the mystery man finds a broken-down postal vehicle and steals the jacket plus the hat and starts playing off as a postman represented the Restored United States of America. He is now known as the Postman, who walks from town to town, giving letters, taking letter for his next drop and providing a spark of hope as he lies to the town of how the country is slowly trying to build it self up. This causes a young group of individuals to take up the postman oath and become the new generation of hope.The movies plays well around the notion of a reluctant hero who is willing to take responsibility which resonates with the timeless phrase ""all that is needed for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing."" Will Patton's General Bethlehem portrayal may seem over the top, but he does well in reflecting how an average man arose to take the opportunity and will keep hold on power which is demonstrated with his grandiose displays of cruelty and bullying on anyone who stands in his way.The movie explains the cycle of how different types of charismatic leadership have the capability to bring about change which can shift to turmoil or to progression. This epic softly explains how dictators have a central belief system masqueraded by traditional education and encompassed to the collective. The system itself is tweaked in order to manipulate various communities. The film does well to softly touch on this while explaining how changing the past through eliminating education from the general public will allow this manipulation to be conquered at ease. What's interesting about this film is the communication around the need for revolution to disrupt the current state of dictatorship. What's disappointing is that everything interesting it proposes it discards in favour of cliched drama. We are given a swashbuckling, slow-motion and corny scenes which are set to a thousand strings orchestra. There is a good film struggling to get out from under it all, for now 6/10.",The Postman
45,vranger,Solid post apocalyptic story,8,19 June 2009,"Some films seem to inspire both devotees and hateful critics, and ""The Postman"" is evidently one of those films. For the hateful critics, I just don't see where they are coming from.The Postman is a bit of an epic story, certainly not the best effort ever on an epic, but by no means is it so terrible as many of the low scoring posters here claim.It is a solid story. It progresses logically. It has the right mix of bad guys to provide tension, and it has a realistic hero who develops some ideals, rather than a superman who mows thru every villain in sight, then flexes and asks for more.I enjoyed the movie, and most people will unless they got up on the wrong side of the TV that day. LOL",The Postman
46,ivko,The power of communication,7,11 April 2017,"This movie was panned by critics and largely shunned by audiences as well, a fact I always found confusing because to me it has always been inspirational and uplifting.The movie takes place in an unspecified year, although if you use clues in the movie you can infer a date of somewhere around 2015 or so. Set in an alternate future where the United States has fallen after an un-specified war/disaster, the population of the country has reverted to an agrarian, old-west inspired collection of city- states.The unnamed 'Postman' (Costner) is a drifter who scavenges what he can and performs Shakespeare for food and shelter when he passes thru a friendly town. After discovering a crashed US Postal Service truck, the Postman dons the deceased driver's uniform and hatches a scheme to get free food and lodging from walled-off towns by concocting a story about a restored US government that is re- starting postal service.What he underestimates is the power and inspiration the simple idea has to the populations of these towns that live in isolation from one-another and in fear of a wandering conscript army led by a brutal warlord that grows by parasitically feeding off their resources. Without his knowledge, his deception inspires an actual re-birth of postal service, with deliveries performed by an inspired younger generation of voluntary carriers that revere the larger- than-life image of him passed along in stories from town to town.What's fascinating to me about this film is how it highlights the power of something we largely take for granted in this day and age: communication. Not too long ago the majority of humanity lived and died within the place they were born. Information from outside their town or village was brief and sporadic, typically limited to what information you might glean from traveling merchants and the like. Technology and infrastructure upended that, and fortunes were made feeding our intense human interest in communicating and learning about the world around us.In our modern world, even those who live and die within a few square miles typically receive news from across the world with casual ease; radio, television, phones, newspapers, etc. And even those on the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder can afford to place a telephone call or write a letter or email to family thousands of miles away. It's easy to forget that for the vast majority of human history the ability to communicate with people more than one hundred miles or so from where you lived took weeks or even months, if it was even possible at all. Before the telegraph, the pony express was vital because it reduced communication over a few thousand miles to 10 days.Against a backdrop of dangerous wilderness and a violent militia, people who would brave these risks to bring communication back to the world is inspiring, and that is what I always think of when I watch this movie. To me, it's a caution not to take the wonders of the modern world for granted and a reminder of the power of communication to enrich our lives. And, I suppose, a story about how one person at the right time and place can inspire change that affects thousands or even millions of others.I've heard critics say that the movie plays as cheesy or maybe that it plays to Costner's ego or something. Good and evil are clearly differentiated here; the film doesn't challenge you with complex ethical questions and definitely plays as an epic hero story, but that didn't bother me. I guess it comes down to whether you think the story is over-idealized to the point where it becomes simple minded and child like; to me it does not.",The Postman

I don't think people would organize and work so well together over mail, maybe food and clothing distribution, with mail/information exchange as secondary.

To my surprise, it had some nice moments but not enough of them to rescue it from loser status. Costner made the alienated-but-heroic-loner-in-a-hostile-environment formula work beautifully in 'Dances with Wolves but failed in 'Waterworld' and fails again here.Costner is a charismatic and athletic movie star but he isn't much of an actor  as he demonstrates here. Listening to Costner quote Shakespeare (sort of) is painful and three hours of the man in a postman's hat, which he is supposed to have found but which fits perfectly and has a heroic fifty-mission crush are far too much Costner. The movie is saved in part by the terrific performances of Will Patton as the villain and Olivia Williams. Both are effective actors with a lot of range. Although Patton didn't get to show too much of his range here, Williams certainly did do so. Another plus is the excellent photography.I can't really recommend that anyone spend three hours watching ""The Postman if there is anything better to do.

The parts of AZ, Or. and WA. he used are very beautiful. I've been to all of them. Fortunately for me, it was pre-atomic war and pre Postman, otherwise I might be saddled with thinking, ""Oh, there's that landscape from the Postman,"" like always being reminded of Elvira Madigan when hearing Mozart's 21st.Kostner has a good heart. But he should just act, not direct and find a decent screen writer. The lines in this movie were so silly, so often, that I began to wish for a :-) after only those times I should be laughing.

The movie is watchable, but the script is a lot like something from a TV mini-series.  Costner is the focus of virtually every scene, and it's hard to root for him or care about his character, it's so predictable that he's going to win and save everyone.  The movie is beautifully shot and intense at moments, but the line between the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is so cliched, that it renders the movie silly and laughable.

52,Alcaminhante,An excellent surprise and a great movie !,10,8 May 1999,"The only thing wrong with this movie is that it should have been 4 hours instead of 3 !I went to see "" THE POSTMAN "" almost dragged , because i had seen so many bad reviews in american television channels, that i was totally brainwashed into thinking this would be a waste of time.I thought this was going to be another "" WATERWORLD "". One more excellent idea wasted in special and stuntman effects, with nothing more than lots of battles and chases. I was wrong.This is a very good movie, with a great story and to my knowledge very well directed. Excellent use of the enviroments with magnificent images without forgetting about the characters. Costner is becoming one of my favorite movie makers and i can´t wait to see his next project.My first intial impression of this film was not that great, and i thought that it was going to be nothing more than a Mad Max rip-off set in the States, with horses instead of trucks. But after the first chase suddenly the story started to become very good and filled with small details that added beauty to it. By the first hour of movie i was loving every minute of it.By the end i couldn´t believe that this movie was so trashed down in it´s own country. Why ?!!99% of the reviews here in Europe apparently don´t understand it either. I never did find a bad review about this movie in more than 30 that i read, then I decided to compare it with the american reviews and what surprised me was that most of them, only talk of how the movie was filled with complete impossibilities. One reviewer even wrote that Costner should have ask forgiveness to the american public for presenting such a bad image of America´s future.It was the last american review i read.What´s a matter with these people ?!! This is just movie ! An almost sci-fi story. Fantasy !And in a country were a good movie is destroyed because of its content, i don´t find that dark future is  that unbelievable !Some critics said, that this movie was nothing more than a giant mirror for Costner´s ego. Why ? Because he´s the hero and the director at the same time ?Others attacked the casting saying, that the actor who played the bad guy, was a terrible choice because he wasn´t convincing enough and didn´t looked like a villain at all. EXCUSE ME ?!!!!Is "" THE POSTMAN "" a new VAN DAMME movie ?!!The fact that the bad guy looks like the neighbour next door, i think it´s even more creepy than if he looked like the devil. He´s the one who gives instant credibility to that devasted world, because he looks just like a normal person.This was an excellent casting choice. Probably the best in the movie. Anyway the actors do a great job in it, specialy the kids.There is nothing wrong with this movie. This is an excellent story and very well writen, acted, photographed and directed. Even the patriotic stuff, usual in this movies is tolerable and it´s never a shore to watch, because the story compensates.I loved this movie, and i only wished it had a few scenes in a big devasted city like New York or something.Now i understand why in Europe it is said, that if a film is a success in the States, it´s going to be the same in here but we never know what we get.But if the film is a flop there, then nobody should miss it here, because it has quality for sure.I´m starting to agree.And i hope Costner keeps doing this kind of epics, because until now, his movies have neen an exception , in that ocean of idiotic products that Hollywood is making this days.",The Postman

The script is totally overloaded with schmaltz - a pure glucose overdose. The cast seem to be taking the whole thing so seriously when they are participating in a joke. The only good thing about the movie is Will Pattons performance as the bad guy but his eyesight is failing as he cannot recognise Costner without his facial hair.It also is annoying that Ribisi (playing a loon again) and Russo (playing a bad ass again) are offed in the first half hour as they were entertaining. But hey great looking blu ray.,The Postman
55,A-Ron-2,Well... I am glad to see that I am not the only person who liked this film,8,19 February 2000,"I truly do NOT understand why The Postman was attacked as viscously as it was by the film media (there films much more worthy of the Golden Raspberry Awards in 1997).  I loved this film and was very impressed with the loving amount of dedication that it demonstrates on the part of the actors, writers and director.  This was a GOOD movie: it had a strong and intelligent story; excellent and interesting characters; and real feel for the post-Apocalypse genre.  I felt that Kevin Costner's everyman act worked beautifully in this film and created a sense of reality for the character and of his situation. 
As far as the sci-fi novel by David Brin, this film exceeded it in every way possible.  Where Brin had to rely on cheezy sci-fi standards (like supersoldiers) to resolve his story, this film does using only two men, both frauds, and both with radically different understandings of what constitutes a proper society.  That is what made this film great (and I rarely use the term great), that this film was essentially an examination of America and what America means.  It was a parable of sorts about the types of men Americans are and what they are capable of (notice that the head bad-guy had a traditional, classical education, while Costner did not; he appreciated these things but they were not at the center of his belief system... I wonder why).  While I do not agree with every aspect of this film (I am a Medievalist and a Platonist, so I don't necessarily feel the same way about the Western Canon that the film-maker may have), I still find it to be a beautiful reflection on the psyche of the American everyman.  America has a tradition of rejecting the absolutist ideals of the past in favor of the pragmatic relativism of today, and I think that this film is a parable of the divorce of America from the traditions of Europe.  Overall, this is a complex and entertaining film and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in examinations of American culture and tradition, perhaps as a double feature with Citizen Cane (I am not, however, claiming that the Postman was as good a film as Citizen Cane, only that they have a similar theme... what does it mean to be an American?).",The Postman
56,Danimal-7,Ambitious idea shot down by predictability and tons of schmaltz,4,15 September 1999,"(Caution: several spoilers)Someday, somewhere, there's going to be a post-apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink.  Unfortunately, THE POSTMAN is not that movie, though I have to give it credit for trying.Kevin Costner plays somebody credited only as ""the Postman.""  He's not actually a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western America devastated by some unspecified catastrophe.  He trades with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare.  Suddenly a pack of bandits called the Holnists, the self-declared warlords of the West, descend upon a village that Costner's visiting, and their evil leader Gen. Bethlehem (Will Patton) drafts Costner.  After much misery and numerous efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.We now finally get to the major premise: the escaped Costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman.  A number of the village people led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to get in on this postman act, which does not sit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the Holnists.The idea of The Postmen versus The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds.  The Holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the Holnists can destroy any one village, but could not stand against all their victims united.  To unite, the villages must communicate with one another, and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the Holnists out of business.  So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers.  Unfortunately, Bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him, but instead your old standby cliche, the one-on-one brawl between him and Costner.  Nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard ""Hi, Aunt Debbie"" stuff played for maximum sentimental value.THE POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies, shot for shot, that I have ever seen.  Now, I don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next.  But here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; I just knew what was going to happen next whether or not I wanted to know.  After a lion is prominently showcased eating people, a Holnist bandit seeking the escaped Costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then ""shocked"" when the lion eats him.  A bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings out some Famous Last Words right before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise.  A covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: Costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie.  A man tells Bethlehem that no sir, you can't just take my wife; Bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through, though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting.But it is rank, cloying sentimentality that really undoes THE POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, playing Costner's lover Abby, is worst served.  She pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere.  She tries so hard, it's heart-breaking.  But nobody could ever have made the lines ""I have a gift for you, Postman . . . You give out hope like it's candy in your pocket"" sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are.  Another example is the scene where a mounted Costner thunders past a little boy, ignoring his proffered letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes, and then thunder back to pick up the letter.  Why didn't Costner just pick it up the first time?  No real reason; it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kid's hopes and then restoring them.Schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the Postman is revealed.  I sat thinking, ""Please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid.  Surely that is too saccharine, too obvious for even this movie.""  Then, alas, the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away, and I held my head in my hands and thought, ""Somebody shoot me.""  It felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat.Gen. Bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal.  Your standard-issue post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, toughest S.O.B. in the valley. Bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others.  Although some menace is thereby sacrificed, Bethlehem is credible in a way most villains aren't. Unfortunately, Will Patton overacts.  And although we are told early on that Bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, Bethlehem's actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous.The acting is otherwise pretty good.  Costner has done better, but his Razzie was an overreaction.  As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive.  Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job.  James Newton Howard's score is competent, though short of the epic standards the movie was going for.  But it's not enough to save this film.Rating: *1/2 out of ****.",The Postman

It's problem is not really the ups and downs of the storyline, the acting or even the cinematography. It's the over-indulgent dotting of all the i's, the underlining of every philosophical twist and issue and the music, oh boy the music. In a post-apocalyptical world, where the costumes seem to have come through relatively unscathed, the search for overweening patriotism goes on and on and on and on until eventually it feels mawkish even if in the main it's not. Whatever happens on screen, the music triumphantly punctuates it with stirring noble sentiment - its like having twenty four sugars in your coffee - whatever the visual dynamics, it becomes ever more difficult to stir and with the film running at a tad under three hours, by the time you eventually do reach the bottom, you find the ending barely lukewarm and you end up with a mouthful of dregs.",The Postman

Its a film that is really not any great but really not bad. Moreover the film aims to bring about some important concept of formation of unity which i did not think became a failed attempt.

It's just a shame judicious nipping and tucking didn't take place to deliver a sub-two hour story, as the bloated running time is a major setback.

60,Healing_Process,"Feel good for some, Trash for Cynics",5,15 October 2020,"The Postman, A 90's epic movie which fell so short it was hard for me to watch the movie all the way through. If you could swallow the 90's tropes, you will be bombarded with many other things that truly rubbed me the wrong way. Like multiple scenes that didn't need to be in the movie which made it 3 hours long, the intelligence or lack there of of majority of the characters and townsfolk, and the unrealistic pacing of the movie that really took me out of the story.The movie is full of schmaltz and for the wrong reasons. Depending on your level of cynicism you will most likely scoff or laugh uncontrollably from how cheesy some of the scenes are. Too many things in the movie were piled on top of each other that took you away from the immersion of the movie. Full functioning cities that seemed to have no problem except the ability to send letters, the large countryside of Northwest america that seemed to be primarily occupied by a few giant groups of people who were paralyzed by a not-so-dangerous other group that essentially had more horses and the good ole 90's USA patriotism that was somehow hidden from intimidation even though another group was ""anti-american"".Essentially, everything felt forced, was unrealistic given the time and circumstances, and the slow motion shots, and over the top epic music didn't fit what was actually going on.The only thing that truly made this movie somewhat watchable and nothing lower than a 5/10 is the fact that it still had a good production value to it and the acting wasn't the real downfall. Writing and story development really made this hard to swallow on top of predictable dialogue and unrealistic character situations. If you are looking for a ""feel-good"" movie from the 90's I could recommend this, but due to how it has become outdated and how it could really lose people who are cynical I'd have to give it the same bet of giving it a 5/10.",The Postman

Adapted from a 1985 novel, the movie is set in 2013, in a post-crash central oregon wasteland, from after a nuclear war no one tells about. the United States don't exist anymore and oppression is in the hands of a Neo-Fascist army called the Holnists. Force to enroll in the Holnists army, a drifter who had been surviving by staging shakespearian plays deserts and finds the corpse of a postal carrier. From then on, he starts to deliver mail, proclaiming to be restoring the USPS under the authority of a Restaured United States of America, which doesn't please the Holnist Army. While trying to live below their radar, it turns that his lie had much of an impact and several kids engage as mail carriers, restablishing mail networks in central Oregon, restablishing connections among the human settlements when only fear and fascist army had been in power for the last decade and setting up a resistance to them.",The Postman

It also has an optimistic viewpoint, overall, and portrays the few surviving Americans as largely decent and resourceful, which doesn't play well for the pessimistic, left-wing crowd.It was well-directed and well-acted, and it also did a superb job of translating the book into a movie -- something that is rarely ever done. Some criticize it as being over-long, with which I disagree. If the story needs an extra hour or so to make it work, I'd rather see it that way than chopped to pieces to fit some arbitrary show-length. Do these people avoid books that are ""too thick?""  Yeah, they probably do.I like most of Costner's work, but I'd rate this above even Dances With Wolves.

Other than Tom Petty appearing as himself (which was entertaining by its' own virtue alone) the film could be used as an indictment against Hollywood, and a call to arms for anybody who feels that they have been robbed of 3 hours of their life and subjected to mind-numbing dialogue.From the opening scene to the final scene, you will find nothing here.",The Postman

66,antimatter33,David Brin gave it a thumbs up - haters can bite it,9,9 August 2021,"Who, you ask, is David Brin? He is a renowned writer of science fiction who authored the book on which the film is based. Not only did he think the film was an excellent effort, he and Costner collaborated on the moral message the story was meant to convey, and Brin himself was ""ecstatic"" with Costner playing his hero. That's good enough for me.But in fact, as a lover both of science fiction in general, and of those stories with a vast sweep involving the entire society, particularly apocalypse stories, I found the film outstanding in all ways, even deeply touching, at the first and all subsequent viewings. It creates its post-apocalypse world without exaggeration and assigns it a direct cause - not radioactivity or plague, but disconnectedness, lack of communication. The society fragments and falls into survival mode, not from political motives, but because it is simply impossible to organize on any scale without the means of communication offered by something as humble and basic as snail mail - delivered if necessary on foot and by horseback, just as was in fact done in the past.Not only Costner, but the entire cast, are outstanding, and the rise of authoritarians on the right in the USA and abroad shows just how sinister is the idea of a copier salesman with delusions of grandeur. The film can be said to have anticipated the rise of the Tea Party and other usurpers of cooperation and compromise, who seek to break our civilized norms down in order to recreate the society in their own authoritarian image. And just as in the film, our best defense is solid communication and joint action by those who are the real defenders of family values and individual rights.A superb film in all ways.

I had my doubts of being able to sit through a 2h 50 min movie but the plot managed to keep my attention the whole way through. This is a post apocalyptic story but I could very easily see this as a 1950s western - set in the Wild West in 1873 with Gary Cooper playing a lone postman, Dan Duryea the leader of a gang of thugs wrecking havoc on a small town without a sheriff and perhaps Ann Blyth as the young widow who reluctantly falls for our hero.Perhaps the patriotic themes that the film associated with the post service was a bit over the top, it looked like the movie was trying to do with the mail man profession what Backdraft did for firefighting.

71,hypersonic8999,"Not a bad movie, could use better direction",5,26 February 2012,"The film is about the near post-apocalypse, where men try to struggle through the aftermath of nuclear winter and a world war. The catastrophe was caused by a religious/nationalist group called the Holnists. After the war, the surviving humans in the former united states form little settlements to survive, but are daily terrorized and ruled over by the remaining Holnist army. A vagabond (Kevin Costner) is first captured by them to be conscripted in their army, but manages to escape. He finds refuge in a town called Pineview where he poses as a postman of the reformed US (which is a lie he fabricates to get food) but the people of the town fill with hope and make his lie reality. Soon, a whole postal service is organized which poses a threat to the Holnist regime.The idea of the film is a pretty good one. I generally like the genre of post-apocalyptic films, but this one would be by far my favourite, if it only had a mildly better director. Kevin Costner took Waterworld (1995) and decided to set it on land. The difference is that in this one, the action is very scarce and the drama much more. That would be a good thing, if every scene was not constantly overdramatized. Instead of watching how the rebellious postmen fought against the Holnists, we just see how Kevin Costner's character feels guilt at every turn for getting people killed. Again, it's not a bad thing to show this, but if it takes the whole of the film, then it becomes boring, especially since the film goes on for 3 hours. 3 hours is too long to just talk about one thing considering only one character, when you have a far more interesting story running in the background. The point of the film should have been how the little lie Costner said to the people of Pineview got out of proportions and spread into a rebellion, which would convey a lot of good messages, and would have been more interesting. An example of how bad the background war story was undersized in expense for the guilt story of the Postman, is the last scene (SPOILER ALERT) where the Holnist leader the The Postman fight for leadership of the Holnist army, but the fight only takes a few seconds and seems very unimportant compared to other parts of the movie where Kevin Costner tries to stop his lie from spreading.Also, I hated, as I stated above, the overdramatization of a lot of scenes, especially the scene where the boy goes out the house to hand Costner a letter. I don't like films (especially in the 90s where this used to be tradition) that have an orchestral ""uplifting and inspiring"" theme song running throughout the film without pause. Especially in a post-apocalyptic film, where everything is supposed to be grim, a director should choose very carefully what kind of music he uses and where he uses it. Take for example, Children of Men, where the music is very rare throughout the film and the director there uses silence or ambient background noise to convey the feeling of catastrophe and misery that overtakes that timeline.In general, watch it if you want, it's not a bad film and is kind of inspiring in some parts, but if it had a better direction it could have been a masterpiece. Also, be warned: it goes on for 3 hours",The Postman

Because the writers and the producers were not shallow. The movie does not come down just to pure action. If you want that, you might want to watch a James Bond movie. This movie also has character growth, many adventures and some witty lines as well. So a two-hours movie would have been too short, while a one-and-a-half movie would have been more of a trailer.So if you haven't seen it yet, take some pop-corn (but not too much cause it'll spoil your focus), make yourself comfy and enjoy it.",The Postman

One of the things I like most about The Postman is the message it sends that no matter how bad things are, if you have hope & a purpose in life, things will get better. The battle scenes were well done, the stunt work very good, & the plot kept everything moving along as it should have. Costner is a better than average horseman, he must've taken lessons while making Silverado, & handled the action scenes like a real pro.

It took me a few minutes to 'settle in' to this movie myself, but once I got beyond the weakish beginning, I came to realize that this was indeed a very good movie. I think it's tough for folks to reconcile the post-apocalyptic sullen theme of the film as there aren't any melodramatic special effects, nor any signs of urban mass destruction. There is no visual indication of ruin and destruction and the only indication we have is the opening commentary. Maybe the ""critics"" didn't seem to like it much because it is quite a lengthy film at nearly 3 hours. Personally though, I really enjoyed this film, there are good performances all around, a very believable storyline (history proves; Hitler, The Roman Empire, Napoleon, Saddam, etc.) and since the 'dog' is presently ""man's best friend"", well in a post-apocalyptic world, what's wrong with having an ""ass"" to tell your secrets to, lol.

The direction was really very good, the cinematography and some of the sets were superb, the acting was okay and the script had more merit than it is generally given credit for, though I was very turned off by the part about the woman asking the postman to father her child. It's a very emotional film, but I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing.I think it's the message that turned a lot of people off. Certainly there was a lot of patriotism, and not being American, this did not appeal to me particularly. However, far above this was the theme that restoring people's hope can accomplish incredible things.

79,daniel-kyle,Why? (A Rhetorical Perspective),10,28 November 2010,"I have never understood why so many people, critics and moviegoers alike, list this movie among the worst ever. It was certainly not due to disappointment in the cinematic treatment of the 1985 novel by David Brin - for I doubt that anyone seeing the movie had actually read the book (first). And, on it's very long length and scope it differs little from Costner's own Dances With Wolves (and shares a great deal with the spirit of Field Of Dreams as well). In fact, long movies are often seen as good value for the dollar, and have always been celebrated as epics - think Lawrence Of Arabia and Ice Station Zebra - to name a few. When many movies are 90 mins or less these days, I really WANT to get at least 2 hours of entertainment for my money. So, the bad points? Is the acting bad, or is the production value low? Does the long movie tend to drag out too often? Is it just a bad story? I say none of the above, at least not in any fatal way. There are slow parts, and a few scenes of pretentious message delivery, but I would actually list these as positives, or be at least neutral on them given the subject matter. The movie is very true to the theme of the book, and therefore is not a Mad Max type of post-apocalyptic adventure. That is not to say there are no action scenes, and it is in the setting up of the conflict that I find the movie has its greatest strength - and greatest humanity, which is what Brin's novel was all about. Further, the differences in the movie compared to the book leave me feeling that the movie was, in fact, an improvement. As a study in human nature, there is a whole developing scenario regarding the rise of the militia that is classic in its understanding of military leadership quite unlike anything produced recently (start thinking more along the lines of Lord Of The Flies). However, as far as ""action movies"" go, this is the polar opposite of the current trend, using even Costner's own Waterworld as an example, though it too was a flop. Costner himself is an unusual Hollywood force, with a hit and miss scorecard that is unpredictable.

Since war and society have had such a great impact on how society is formed and stabilized the ""experts"" thought that making a science of war would be a hell of an idea, so they did.

One perspective as the title denotes is communication with any culture, creed, or color race. Open communication is a tool to allow peaceful negotiations to conflict. Thus the Postman is the savior of the United States of America in this movie.However, as the legion of eight (8), resembles what I first commented upon.

Well, Costner is still directing...we'll have to see what story he destroys next. The movie is loosely based on the book at best. There are 3 things that the movie shares with the book. 1. It's post-apocalyptic. 2. The hero pretends to be a U.S. postman. 3. There are some bad guys called Holnists. That's about it. Everything else came out of left field of dreams. Especially annoying are the teenager postman wannabe's. (Spoiler) Then there's the monument Costner built to himself at the end. Wow, this guy is almost as egotistical as Steven Segal.

85,ReadingFilm,Far ahead of its time,10,30 October 2019,"Afterward I'm in its glow. It's quite actually about a loser who fails up because 'destiny' chooses anyone on hand, vs the foil who believes destiny chooses for greatness. So the villain trains in greatness while the postman trains in integration. It's about the second founding of the United States, once again the common man vs the elitist. Had the postman ever learned to fight, or was it house odds alone by the end which gave him faith? Knowing the 'story' could not fail him in any way, he realized he can't lose. Small as the house odds are this averages into a definite outcome across a timeline as the universe bends toward justice. The Costners will always rise. Also interesting 'story' does Bethlehem in where his eight rules, this narrative of his concentration camp, are subverted holding him to his very own standard. His reaction as if Shakespeare shot him with lightning, his defeat was sealed with those words, not the fight itself. Story sets in and does him in, in a story about 'story', as why it also rings pitch perfectly, as they keep quoting Shakespeare they forget how all the world is a stage... Postman starts literally an actor, but get this, Costner playing a drifter pretending to be an actor pretending to be a postman. So what it's doing is creating this frame of the narrative constantly. And how it brings letters to the people, it brings the narrative to them, essentially... he brings them cinema. Even there in the pit it's cinema--but only wholesome ones--Costner addresses his critics, it's self-deprecating in a way, and shows just how tightly wound this film is. People are hopeless until they're given the story of who they are. It goes small to big with this chain effect of narrative building to identity bodies. This is the use of the film as well, and use of Costner himself in a very meta way, as I came to understand the work of the actor and director being entirely separate, which is an achievement in calibration: the film student discovering the icon in real time, here both a reflective and useful narcissism. Kevin is Kevin's favorite director and actor indeed. (You could also say Bethlehem is a play on Costner as director facing off against Costner literally as actor.) The film, it's special, it's so worshipful of story, narrative, and integration, almost to a point it brings about this Spielbergian ending casting itself in bronze (there preceding Private Ryan). Its themes are so on the nose and over the top but in such a way the more on the nose it is, the more it reveals itself, it becomes a sort of constantly 'working'. Someone told me 'Costner's only talent is he has really good taste.' Yes, but that's the best one to have! As the film is weird and misconceived, this is operating in the conceptual framework so always useful; its scope allows for tangents that don't work, but 'not working' is allowed when everything services its thesis of integration conceptually, even down to his performance. We've come to forget that epics are an entirely different canvas. It's why it kept managing to win me back every time it lost me. Costner earns his icon for the nth time but this time in a reflective study of story itself, it becomes a sort of summation, peak, and goodbye to his odd string of 90s blockbusters where suddenly we had a new Paul Newman or Kirk Douglas. Costner was king. Remember he won Director, he knows what works, he can do what works in his sleep, here it's about evolving the form just a little more.",The Postman
86,chadlund,Why the hate ?,8,30 May 2016,"Kevin Costner has to be the most under appreciated actor alive because none of his movies are in the list of the top 250.I didn't see the movie in theaters back then, so when I saw its ratings, I was a little moved to see such low ratings and appreciations. And then I watched it, and I guarantee you, you will remember this movie quite well and positively. It is a very good movie, it's three hours but they really don't seem three boring hours like in the Godather. Kevin Costner giving his best effort as usual.The Postman just might be Costner's best works. Of course, not as much as Dances with Wolves and Waterworld, but the effort displayed, the stage, the number of people they cast, the dialogue too isn't lame.There are aspects that don't work, such as: why did Costner make an apocalyptic movie two years after Waterworld ? It doesn't make sense, especially since WW is set in the year 3000, but he's free to do it.The Postman is a very inspiring movie, carries a message of hope, people's democracy, against fascism.You can see Costner's development evolves, from a friendly animator, to a survival drifter, to a selfish man escaping his lies, to a leader fighting for a purpose that he started.

88,ShimmySnail,"not as bad as they say, but not great",6,5 October 2003,"I gave this film a 6, meaning I'd recommend it for people who want an entertaining sci-fi action flick, but are not the nit picky types or those who demand an insightful message.  It's not nearly as bad as folks say. Costner is his usual wooden self, but his character is written around it. Nothing is exceptional, and it has all the pitfalls of a usual sci-fi flick, like an unrealistic premise, a blending of some high-tech pre-apocalyptic technology, such as assault rifles, and a total ignorance of other, more mundane things, such as the telegraph, and there is the usual sci-fi transcendence of space and time where characters appear in different places instantly as needed by the plot, and a map of their movements would look like a plate of spaghetti passed through a half dozen time-travelling wormholes.  But unlike in some other sci-fi films which pretend to be realistic, most of that can be ignored because they don't take themselves too seriously.There is a lot of well placed humor, both Costner one-liners and some subtle straight man jokes (Tom Petty showing up as the mayor of a town and admitting that he used to be someone sorta famous, kinda), and that really carries it through the three hours of the film.Visually, again, nothing spectacular, it's not a blinky booming Matrix sci-fi but more of a low tech Planet of the Apes kind of sci-fi, but the visuals are fairly unified (dusty, grungy, nothing out-of-place pristine except everyone's skin and teeth are way too nice for a dismal future, but I digress) and the fight scenes are totally believable, which is very rare for any kind of movie these days.The plot and most characters are two-dimensional but consistent, though Olivia Williams' character shows a good deal of development, and the particulars of the final resolution are at least not entirely predictable.Think of it as Road Warrior Lite, very lite, but more funny.",The Postman

Then he made another movie, and then another... (you get the point) - and all of them were trashed in America and very well received in Europe. So, what did Kevin do next? Did he move to Europe? Did he made his next movie there? Nope - he decided to make a 101% American movie, directed practically only at the American audience (notice that Europe simply doesn't exist in this movie, it's like located on another planet), in hope of playing on its insultingly blatant patriotic (""overpatriotic"" would be a better word) undertones, and succeding on this basis. What he *did* eventually make was a three hours overlong (no mistake here), boring, choppy, silly, naive ridiculous soap opera that - this time deservingly - got more trashing than all his previous movies combined. And it got that trashing from American critics and audience, the very ones that Kevin so hoped to convince he made a great piece of cinema! Kevin - it's no use trying to *make* someone like you: attempts to do that make people even less liked than before! I still can't see why ""Water World"" or ""Robin Hood"" took such beatings in America - they're very popular and liked in Europe, and besides, they're good movies.

This film ends up drowning in it's attempt at being an epic despite some beautiful cinematography and strong performances from supporting actors Larenz Tate, Olivia Williams, and Will Patton.

The story concept via David Brin's novellas, is a loose translation of that work, and as the story advances, differs greatly from the 2- 3rd novellas in that story line. However, the overall concept, is conceived accurately of symbol of civilization combating oppression of freedom via the overreaching tyrants of the eight (in the movie). Every once in awhile, both critics and audiences, seem to miss the mark on a review rating, though rare, I would consider this a exception to both ratings.

But the Italian film cost less than $200,000 instead of tens of millions, has a lot of funky looking cars instead of horses, takes place in gravel pits rather than the grand Northwest, and the rape scene is very gay. But it is fast paced, completely unpretentious, unabashedly ridiculous - a real hoot.The acting in ""The Postman"" is just as bad as that in the Italian film, but the dialog is far worse without being any funnier, the characters much less interesting. And it drags and drags. Also, there's nowhere near the sheer amount of action that there is in the Italian film. And it's so pretentious, you'll look for cues for genuflection.

Sure this isn't the greatest film of all time by any standards, but in a time dominated by Doom & Gloom generic post apocalypse movies, The Postman was a breath of fresh, positive air and if you can ignore the little things like ""Why is there a lion in Oregon"" (Portland Zoo?) or ""How did the Holnist come to power? "" this is a great movie with a great message. The main character may have initially only used the story of being a Postman to get food and so he wouldn't get shot when he walked into a village, but his lie inspired hope. The movie has a comedic lightness to it, but it has it's serious moments and there are some great quotes like ""Wouldn't it be nice if the a--holes who started wars were the ones who had to fight them?"" General Bethlehem represented the aspects of the violent, racist, misogynistic gun-hoarding survivalists, taking advantage of the ''clean slate'' provided by the apocalypse to re-create civilization the way he saw fit, but with all the bad parts of it. His idea of a society was more like medieval times.

99,mhthehammer,Pretty derivative and silly,4,28 May 2020,"Dances with Wolves is a movie that labeled Kevin Costner as one of the most prolific directors and producers of the 1990's. His filmmaking credibility however disintegrated once his post-apocalyptic science fiction flop The Postman debuted in theaters. An unnamed outlaw (Kevin Costner) escapes from a fascist government concentration camp, dons a uniform from a dead postman and travels into the blockaded city of Pineview, Oregon. There, he plots to reform the U.S. government and fight General Bethlehem (Will Patton) and the Holnists for their country, almost akin to Robin Hood. Part of why this movie failed critically and box office wise was Costner's tired, self-indulgent plot and message about fighting against authority for the better of the country. Despite the excellent costumes, decent cinematography and entertainingly dated design of 2013, The Postman was not well-written, not well-directed and seemed derivative of other movies such as Mad Max, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Waterworld. Plus, the epic mano e mano was lame, as The Postman and Bethlehem tackled each other, fell off their horses and physically fought on the dusty ground. It visually looks like I'm watching a catfight that might as well involve them aggressively shoving each other's hands. For that matter, why couldn't they just order their troops to attack instead of letting them watch on horseback? While it is not a good film by any means, The Postman is the most tonally consistent, unlike the other Razzie winners I've seen. (2 Bronze Costner Statues out of 5)",The Postman

Ebert yes, and after watching this that first time, I disagreed with Ebert, too. I am sorry they are neither one still with us, but they had a good run.As far as I know, those friends of mine who've seen the movie thought it was a decent movie, too.As to the movie itself, I just read that the movie was supposed to be a dark movie with a dark ending. I am glad it didn't. What the hell is the matter with the idea that has a positive ending?I LIKED the characters except the antagonists (aren't we supposed to?). I liked the story line, and I liked Costner's character and was pulling for him the whole way.At the time I had a clear sense that Costner had gotten on the bad side of the Hollywood press after Dances With Wolves. Too much success for one guy? Jealousy in a me-me-me LA society? They all seemed to be VIPERS, after his blood. Maybe even Siskel and Ebert didn't want to rock their boat when word came down to sink Kevin's ship.I've seen the movie 4 times now, and will probably see it 2 or 3 times more.

I don't know about the rest of the country, but I must have completely understood it, because I loved it.  I enjoy movies that take you to a time and place in the future that could actually happen (if you don't think something similar could actually happen one day, you are the type to buy into an Amway sales pitch!)  Sometimes I feel that when people hear that a movie is bad, there is no chance of the movie being a good one to them, so they play monkey-see, monkey-do and follow the leader in bashing this movie. I say that because I simply don't understand how that many people could not have liked this movie.  I've seen some absolute junk in my days that don't get nowhere near the bad publicity as this one (Austin Powers 2 and the Scream series to name a few!)  How those movies are accepted and this is laughed away is beyond me as a movie-goer.A couple other user's had great comments that I would like to post again. Like Michael on Jan 20, 2001, he writes: ""I think most people find the plots hard to understand simply because they aren't the pre-package plots that they're used to.""  Exactly.  Most people, like the ones who liked Austin Powers 2, need their hand held by the director throughout the movie because they simply can't make assumptions or realizations for themselves, so they eventually don't understand it and then they make fun of it.  Everybody - WE MOCK WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND!  Just because you can't pick up on what's going on, that doesn't mean this movie is a pile of crap!

The story is drawn out too long and is suddenly cut short near the end of the movie. It's as if the director was like, "" oh I just realized we're approaching the three hour limit so we better cut this short at the end"". The story could have been played out better and with these lackluster set pieces and unoriginality in its post-apocalyptic setting it falls short of what the movie promises. The Postman is a pretty boring movie that goes on and on with no real direction until the movie just closes up very fast near the end.

Watching a recent interview with Costner he was most up front to the fact that he was well aware that a lot of his movie's were not to everyones liking yet over the years it had not stopped him following his instinct into making movie's that had meaning to him...the audience gave him a standing ovation..and well deserved. The critic's panned this movie before it even hit the theatres and can be blamed for all the bad press it got even before it opened...do not believe one word they said....this movie is about the characters,their relationships,their struggles plus a great cameo from Tom Petty.

We both believed Waterworld was OK to good (even though the critics lambasted it as one of the worst movies ever made) and we thought that this movie was very good! I'm just wondering if KC did something to peeve off the critics and academy because this was certainly a much better film than any of them would acknowledge. It's probably OK that critics didn't like it though because lately it seems that critics fawn and gush over ultra-liberal crap that makes me want to projectile vomit into their collective fanny packs. If a movie isn't some over the top far-left fantasy, they generally will either pan it, or blowtorch it into ashes immediately upon release as they did with this one. This movie was apolitical. While it takes place in post-apocalyptic America, it had much more to do with being a study in fundamental human nature than trying to make a statement based on current events. We thought the camera work, scenery, acting and overall production quality was very high. Some might think it was a little too over the top Kevin Costner on Kevin Costner, but I think his performance in this movie was rather sublime. It really confuses me how a relatively thoughtful and well crafted movie like this one can get instantly relegated to the trash heap, but idiotic pablum like 'My unwed teen sister is knocked up' gets 10 thumbs up.Anyway..judge for yourself.

108,themightyservo,Wholly Underrated - Would've Been A Huge Hit In 2002,7,19 May 2012,"The Postman suffered from its release date. Had it come out the first couple years post-9/11, it would've been seen as an uplifting epic and been a huge hit.Instead, it came out in the middle of a period of relative discontent with the US, where there was no threat of anything to be lost, where therewas no threat of stability lost, where there was no greatness to see, as people were absorbed in their own lives and oblivious to the wonders of having such a great country. (Yes, the movie is very focused on the US.) As a national epic, it just came out at the wrong time.There are plenty of bad elements to the film, and the reason why it's a good film and not a great film. The theme is sometimes missing and then returning in a heavy handed way that makes for inconsistency that could've been done better, but it's still a good film. There are cheesy lines, there are characters or their actions that sometimes seem to be a bit forced, but there are others who are completely within the realm of possibility, and some that are very, very believable.Larenz Tate as Ford Lincoln Mercury is one of the most uplifting, motivating, idealistic characters on film in a long time - his spirit by itself is inspiring. There are several scenes in which he really shines, as his character takes responsibility for his actions.Will Patton does a truly outstanding job as General Bethlehem. The character is portrayed every bit as you'd expect a character with his backstory to be - done well, and a character whose occasional seeming overacting would be consistent with how the character - a megalomaniac - would really act. Some small touches towards the beginning really set down who the character is.Kevin Costner is just pretty good. His low-key attitude sometimes comes off as disinterested and not terribly into the role. Costner does have the physical presence to carry off the role, but on occasion he seems just out of it. Sometimes the movie sometimes seems to dwell on Costner too much, even though he is the main character, the changes in the world that he sets in motion are fascinating. He's not bad, he's just good, not great. The other options for leads that were considered would've been far worse. Costner does pull it off well, but he could've put more effort into his own role. Once in a while his own stated motivations (notably at the end) don't seem to have been developed, and it's possible there was something left on the cutting room floor. This goes to the theme as mentioned above and below as well - there may be some scenes that just didn't make the cut that would've expounded on how the theme developed better.Olivia Williams is excellent through most of the movie, though her role becomes a bit conventional at the end, limiting what she can do. (Incidentally, she's great in ""Below"", which I highly recommend as a WWII sub movie - but it's best watched without any reviews, and even without looking at the box - it's best viewed totally fresh, with zero foreknowledge. Seriously, don't go look it up, just cue it on Netflix or order it online and don't read about it. It's really, really, really good.)Tom Petty's role is fantastic. His first few lines, ""I was..."" are rather haunting, when you sit down to think about it; they convey a lot of the atmosphere of the film, and go far towards reminding you the world of the Postman is very different.Daniel von Bargen is excellent, and provides a very good foil for Costner to play off towards the beginning of the film. Almost every scene he's in he manages to convey a seriousness and depth that helps ground the film.Ron McLarty is fantastic. His character is great, and the way he plays into it is great. He's another of the supporting cast that provides atmosphere to the film, conveying the setting even more; he also sets up some great lines that foreshadow a lot of action in a way that is just subtle enough that it's not cheesy at all, but clear enough that the audience can see something big and satisfying is on the way.The scenery is majestic, the setting is made to be truly epic - often it is, the score is fantastic (though sometimes a bit heavy-handed, but that's okay), editing is good, lighting is used well, and there's some subtle symbolism tossed in every so often to go along with the overt themes. Some of the costuming stands out positively (especially the improvised uniformity of the Holnists and the carriers), while the costuming for pretty much everybody else is slightly overdone - you can tell there was work put into it, but sometimes almost too much.Overall, the theme is one that may be lost on many folks, and was especially lost at the time. It's a wonderful, patriotic flick that was released at the wrong time. Just remember it's good, not great.",The Postman

113,thedoctor98,pray nobody makes another movie like this,1,22 July 2000,"Let me help you visualise how this film was made.  Somebody said ""I'd like to make a movie based on the idea of how the US Postal Service is a good idea, it just needs restructuring.""  Unfortunately, rather than give it to the ""TV Movie of the Week"" people, they gave it to Kevin Costner.""I want this movie to have people in the aisles, screaming GOD BLESS AMERICA"", he must have said.  ""I want patriotism!  I want to throw in as many classical references as I can, the plot isn't important.  I also want to have sex scenes with a very attractive woman, preferably somebody else's wife.  Oh, and let's make it over two and a half hours long.""And there you have it.  This is designed only for Americans to be able to sit through, and I doubt if even they could manage it for the full length of the film.  There aren't enough ideas for 60 minutes, let alone 165.  The moral of the story seems to be ""God bless this country"", but it will have most people screaming ""God, why, oh why?""",The Postman
114,FlorianSchirner,Uplifting message in a gritty time,8,13 March 2008,"Let's stop arguing whether this film is true to the book (it is not straying as far as other literature-based movies, but it strays)or if it is ultra-patriotic (I think the main message is just a message of hope and that is universal) or if is underrated or not by the critics.Let us just look at some points: First and foremost, what drives this movie, the message. Imagine living in a country, torn and devastated by war and plague, not knowing if your relatives or friends are alive or dead. You just live huddled in small hamlets and isolated from the outer world. Naturally that isolated hamlets without hope can be easily dominated by well trained bandits and outlaws. Now imagine someone coming who brings news from other villages. You hear from your sister you believed to be dead, from your daughter, who you did not see the whole time and so on... Suddenly life is not so dreary anymore. ""Stuff's getting better, everyday"", to quote the movie. People now have hope, and this hope leads to unity, and unity leads to standing up against oppression.#THAT is the power of the written word, and it is also the main message of the movie. ""Stuff's getting better, everyday""To all other movie parts like acting, directing, photography and so on, I find the movie solid to absolutely awesome in some parts The only thing I am not so happy about is the whole plot about the old ex-soldier. I did not read the book, but I think this character is getting some background and importance there. Here you could cut out all his scenes without missing anything. And though the ambush on the Elvis patrol seems to be his planning, the situation and the whole ambush is such a logical tactical development, that even a former shipping clerk (the postman) could have thought of it.All in all, i love that this one is a post-apocalyptic themed movie without all the despair and depravity all other movies in this genre have. This is a film about hope and the power of hope, clad in a bit pro-American and sometimes cheesy scenes. I can only recommend the movie.",The Postman

At least, after the debacle that was ""Waterworld"" and this, people saw Mr. Costner for what he is- only suited to films like Wyatt Earp (A great movie) where he doesn't act so much as brood and be arrogant. I knew he was a fraud the minute I saw Robin Hood- the only one to have no sort of English accent in the entire film.This one's good for setting up a nap.

Well, in this movie Kevin Costner sails the world to save the world...no, that was another bomb, ""Waterworld."" Well, in this movie, Kevin Costner, as a phony mailman, delivers 15 year old letters to save a post-apocalyptic world. They say that a ""pen is mightier than a sword,"" but Costner tries to prove that old letters are mightier than howitzers and automatic weapons wielded by a large army of ruthless cutthroats. To accomplish his task, he reluctantly leads a small band of teen-aged postal carriers who, with their mailbags, foment a revolution to reunite the United States. The movie pulls out all the clichés to tug at the viewer's heartstrings--husband killed in front of his pregnant wife, teen-aged postal carrier witnessing execution of his father, executed postal carrier's father using his last breath to proclaim ""Ride Postman,"" young boy standing forlornly with letter in hand for the driven horse-backed postman, etc., etc., etc., yawn, etc..Hoping to receive an engaging movie in the mail, I was disappointed to get yet another piece of junk mail from Kevin Costner.",The Postman
121,semaj-95339,A good film that doesn't deserve the negativity,8,14 June 2018,"I had never read the book so basing this movie on it's own merits, I like these post apocalyptic movies and this is no exception, beautiful scenery ( I believe it was shot in Oregon ) lone man trying to survive and keep out the way of the Holnists ( an army of survivalists taking control of the region with oppression )Costner donning a Postman uniform he finds while escaping the Holnists comes across a settlement and pretends he's a new Postal Officer set up by the new government to restore communication across the states. This little lie sparks hope within the community and after he leaves a movement starts to grow to create links between the settlements within that state.The bad guy in this is General Bethlehem brilliantly played by Will Patton, egotistical, delusional tyrant and leader of the Holnists a group of followers of Nathan Holn who caused an uprising which led to Americas 2nd and most devastating civil war. I imagine Nathan Holn was like todays Donald Trump stirring up hatred and division leaning towards the right wing, so small petty people likes of Bethlehem grab their chance to shine.Bethlehem has met his match with The Postman who doesn't want to fight more wants to try and sneak away and get on with his golden years but after a harsh winter stuck in a cabin he comes back to find a fully operational postal service working between the settlements created by Ford Lincoln Mercury the true visionary for someone so young. After trying to stop it all and stop the young riders going out running routes himself he relents and has to face facts that he can't stop the movement he inadvertently started so gathers an Army of his own to counter the brutal Bethlehem.

Oh, I think if I were suffering of hunger and tyranny, the first guy I'd go running to would be my local Mail Carrier. Save it. If Costner never made another movie, I'd be content.

Many people thinks this is a very bad movie. But I think this is the perfect movie to see what a great director can do with the worst script of the 90's. I think Kevin Costner did one hell of a job, transforming Brian Helgeland's terrible screenplay, Kevin made an epic tale (not the length) of a postmans resurrection of a nation, Kevin took the screenplay with it's bad dialog, bad story, and made it into one hell of a ride, from the perfect cinematography, James Newton Howard's powerful score, and a cast that does a great job delivering the bad dialog.",The Postman
124,docstrange,One of Costner's best,9,30 June 2004,"This is one of Costner's best efforts. I've seen this movie quite a few times and it gets better every time I see it. People who love this movie find it difficult to understand why some are so critical of it. I liked Waterworld, too, which makes me think that it's a lack of imagination that makes some people unable to appreciate movies like this. A lot of the criticism amounts to ""it doesn't make any sense."" As with any fiction, you need to approach it with a willing suspension of disbelief.This movie does something that few manage to pull off: it has a message and it's entertaining. The story is about populism overcoming militant authoritarianism, of hope and the desire for peace triumphing over war and violence. The strongest aspect of this film is its story, which is entertaining and frequently thrilling. Like ""Waterworld"" it is essentially a quest for something that may be impossible to reach, something both elusive and of world-changing importance. Costner must overcome impossible odds, defeat a powerful enemy, and in the process evolves from self-centered loner to heroic leader.The film isn't perfect, but its flaws are small and have mostly to do with uneven pacing and some minor plot inconsistencies. These are easily overlooked and far outweighed by the film's strengths. After the wonderful story, the acting in this film is its greatest strength. It is filled with likable and memorable characters, and the leads are perfectly cast.People have also criticized it for being overly long, which is a complaint that seems to be heard about every movie ever made that was over 120 minutes long. This is a meaningless criticism. If you like the movie the fact that it's three hours long is a good thing.Although it's set in the near future, it doesn't have the sort of extreme premise that a lot of sci-fi movies do. Even those who aren't fans of sci-fi/fantasy should find this film both accessible and enjoyable.",The Postman
125,reporterman2000,a vanity project,4,17 August 2003,"First things first: I think Kevin Costner is our most underrated and unfairly maligned filmmaker/movie star. People seem to conveniently forget that he starred in such popular hits as ""The Untouchables,"" ""No Way Out,"" ""Bull Durham,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Robin Hood,"" ""JFK,"" and ""The Bodyguard."" I guess the moviegoing public took such great offense at the price tag of ""Waterworld"" that they decided en masse to shun him forever. Strange, since ""Waterworld"" was actually a hit that earned more than $300m. ""The Postman"" was his first real bomb. And I must say, it deserved to tank.It's a vanity project, a big, slow elephant of a movie that lumbers just like an elephant from scene to scene, in search of a point. It does not work as science fiction because it's basically too much of a Western. But it doesn't work as a Western because the characters have knowledge of an advanced technological society (dead though it may be). Sorry, Kev, you can't have it both ways. ""Star Wars"" was a Western at heart, but dang, the Millennium Falcon sure was cool.Then there's Costner himself. What a bad performance. He's overly sincere, drippingly earnest, cloying, sentimental, childish, buffoonish ... not the sort of heroic figure you want to look up to. As a director, he puts himself in laughable situations. Too much of the time, he just stands inert, his face rigid, impassive. A little of that goes a long way; as a director, Costner can be his own worst enemy.Then there's the running time. I would gladly have taken a meat cleaver to this thing and chopped it down to a length the story would have supported... say, about 60 minutes.No question: this is a terrible movie. But it's greatest sin is mere over-sincerity. Costner intends for us to feel really good about all the corny adventure-stuff in ""The Postman,"" and to accept the goofy dialogue as heart-felt. You watch this movie and you don't feel bad, or depressed, the way some bad movies make you feel. You just sort of feel like you've spent a long time watching a movie that climaxes with the unveiling of a statue. Lesson, Mr. Costner: do not bronze your own character again. Not in any movie.

129,Croftman,There's More Deadlier than the Mail!,7,5 December 1999,"The Postman is neither better nor worse than scores of other films of this genre. It seems to me that a general mood or trend has to be established, -which in turn dictates the feeling with which a film is then received.Critics have called it over-sentimental and patriotic; - but Independence Day, -one of the most appalling, cringe-making films ever made, was greeted with audiences clapping and cheering here in Britain! Mainly because of the pre-publicity.If I were Costner, I would cut the film by around 30 minutes. I understand why his films are so long; but I cannot see the point now that the public trend is hostile against anything of this nature that he attempts. Also, he should remove the scene of the little girl singing, and the final statue fiasco (which made me laugh out loud, -not a healthy note on which to finish!). Another major flaw was the fight scene with Bethlehem. This podgy baddie was so inept at hand-to-hand combat that my granny could have easily beaten him! A spectacular finale was badly needed, but sadly it all disintegrated into predictability. (You just knew how the fight would end).I would give this film 7 out of ten.

130,Darbs,Wasted potential,5,2 August 2000,"David Brin's novel ""The Postman"" is an original piece of work, alternately exciting and moving, and always absorbing. Kevin Costner has taken this premise, ripped out much of its interest, inserted a lot of trite moralising and added a glutinous and ridiculous ending. It's much too long as well.

131,WilliamofTexas,Loved it and the sound track,8,23 July 2007,"I, too, cannot understand why the critics panned this movie. I thought it was great, very entertaining, an original idea (hey, that's something new for Hollywood) and Costner did an admirable job. And Will Patton as the General- he's a delight to watch- one of the better bad guys in the movies these days. Also in the film are veterans Joe Santos (Rockford Files), Giovani Ribisi (Cold Mountain, Flight of the Phoenix), Peggy Lipton (Mod Squad), Shawn Hatosy, Ellen Geer and Costner's daughter Lily and son Joe (the little boy holding up the letter for the postman). Also seen is Rex Linn, now Det. Frank Tripp in CSI Miami, under-utilized as usual. In an uncredited appearance is Mary Stuart Masterson. Look for veteran character actor Tom Bower (The Hills Have Eyes & North Country) in the uncredited role of ""Larry"". That's what I really love about this movie is that I can watch it again and again and still discover appearances by then relatively unknown young actors. Did I mention TP himself, Tom Petty? Okay, so he could probably use some acting lessons but it's good to see him in the role of mayor.What is it about Costner that he loves to employ stunt people? The list is long with plenty of veterans there, too.By the way, if you'll read the sound track credits you will see that Mr. Costner sang a duet of the Lovin' Spoonful song ""You Didn't Have To Be So Nice"".

But the ideas that they stand on and promulgate are the only things powerful enough to make humans free against the inertia of tyranny and selfishness.

Come on people, the critics didn't miss the very obvious theme of this movie.  It was jammed down the throat of the viewer. There are some touching scenes, especially if you're patriotic, but the movie really drags for no good reason.  If you want to watch a movie that's slow but actually makes you think, try 2001.  I thought the acting was sub-par, and the editing was horrible.  Some transitions between scenes were confusing.  An sorry, the ending was just plain corny; Both the fight, and then the completely unnecesary frame story with the statue.  If Costner would have made this movie with the intention of it just being something to do for 2+ hours that would be ok. Instead, he presents it as some sweeping epic with a well developed theme to get the viewer thinking, but it completely fails to achieve this.  Here are some other movies you should see if you thought this was ""epic"" or ""thought provoking"": Dune, Blade Runner, The Grapes of WrathOh, and to the guy who complained about the ""cruelty to animals"".  What the heck?  Was your wife not bothered by the humans dying?  How was it ""cruel"" to shoot a horse to stop 3 people (including the baby) from dying?

136,that_ealing_feeling,This postman didn't even get to ring once,7,12 March 2009,"Post-apocalypse films aren't generally my cup of tea, and Kevin Costner would be more likable if he didn't obviously like himself so much. However, the critical and public loathing of The Postman was more an example of runaway group-think than a sensible reaction to an over-inflated but perfectly watchable family picture with a positive message about co-operation and opposition to fascism.There are several highly implausible plot points, especially towards the end, and a somewhat naive, let's-all-be-nice-to-each-other Hollywood idealism that neglects all the tough questions about how human beings can get along together. But in a time when so many films seem to be made for an audience of heartless morons, The Postman should be cut some slack for being a well-made film, with a strong story-line, that you can watch with your children and/or parents without embarrassment. There's no crude humour, hardly any bad language, virtually no sex, and the fairly modest amount of violence is not presented in such a way as to invite us to enjoy it.The only big thing wrong with The Postman is that it isn't anything like as good a film, given its intriguing premise, as it might have been. Unfortunately, it came along at a time when it was parrot-fashion to ridicule anything Costner might do (and, to be fair to the critics, he brought some of that on himself). The film was already being savaged long before it was finished, so this Postman never had the chance to ring once, never mind twice.

The answer is courage.Of all the ""Hero that saves the world"" movies, this is by far one of the best - unlike many action movies, the only resource this hero has is his courage.A well told and touching story.

Unless he has a strong director it is a waste of time.  (Something that also goes for Eddy Murphy.)

Olivia Williams is quite beautiful, as well.  Tom Petty is hilarious in a minor role.  Will Patton is appropriately vile.   I understand the making of the film injected much needed money into the local economy (not here, of course, but rather in trendy Bend, on the other side of the mountains).  This is the good news.The bad news is much worse.  First off, it's way long, just short of three hours.  It takes less time to read the book.  Second, the sound track by James Newton Howard (had to check, thought it might be John Williams on a bad day) is cliched and manipulative (sort of like the script).  I am watching it now on TNT, even as I type this, the moment is coming (what, about 2/3 of the way through) when Costner rides past the little boy, then turns around (spoiler:  the moment will be immortalized later).  Oh, Morning In America music is playing, Costner rides by in slow mo ....  Be still my heart, be calm my gut.Anyhow, finally, just read the book, if you can get it.  (Our public library has two copies, but that's probably because Roseburg is mentioned.)  The plot in the book is more intricate and deals much more deeply with the issue of lying to keep up hope -- which is, after all, what the movie is about.

This film has much to offer for fans of the apocalyptic genre (Road Warrior, Red Dawn, etc.): an intriguing storyline; very good pacing even at its near epic length; good acting; good dialogue; excellent cinematography and a lively score & soundtrack, especially the Pinewood Band tunes. The main cast is appealing with Kevin Costner, Will Patton (in an over-the-top role similar to his ""Falling Skies"" Capt. Weaver), Olivia Williams, Larenz Tate and Tom Petty in more than a just a cameo..add in some recognizable character actors like Ron McLarty, Rex Linn, Daniel Barger, Joe Santos, George Wyner, Giovani Ribisi and Brain Anthony Wilson..a pretty good crew.. Watching this always makes me feel patriotic like when I watch ""Red Dawn"".and despite the almost universal bashing Costner receives, he is often very endearing in his roles (For the Love of the Game, Tin Cup, Wyatt Earp, JFK, Field of Dreams, Bull Durham, No Way Out and Dances with Wolves).if you've ever seen the creepy Mr. Brooks, you know he can actually act.and he does deliver some very funny lines; my favorite: ""So much for the uniform theory"".. 8 stars.watch it for yourself and choose",The Postman

Three hours of pathetic ""patriotism"".Everything happens by accident - an accidentally discovered mail bag inspires Costner's character to use it as mean to get a meal and a shelter. But it will, by accident, wake up some real hope, and accidentally bring to forming of a postal service (which is actually much more than just a postal service - at the time it is the only institution of the new United States, and eventually will become even some kind of it's army!).The moral of the film is pointed out by Costner himself, near the long, long waited end - believing in the United States will make you invincible! Pathetic, at best.If only it lasted two hours shorter, it would be entertaining as an unintentional comedy. But unfortunately, three hours of garbage at one place is not entertaining by any means.",The Postman

149,GeorgiaDixie,"Excellent Movie, Give it a Chance!",8,17 January 2008,"The Postman is one of the best apocalyptic movies and you can write that down. It was one of those movies that was trashed because of Kevin Costner, who actually was a good performer in this film. The basic premise is that is 2013 and war/disease has ravaged the world (war destroying technology and disease annihilating the population) and people are basically living in mid-19th century society, technology-wise. Enter Costner and his false persona that rallies people into a very patriotic war. I have a feeling that the reason many critics don't like this movie is that it has a pro-American tint to it. It has the feeling of a 50s Western and could easily have starred John Wayne or Jimmy Stewart and it is an excellent and entertaining movie. Watch it and I'll let you be a judge.",The Postman

What's worse is that Kevin Costner was stupid enough to both act AND direct this piece of trash. The list of problems with this movie are endless. First of all, this movie is three hours long, with not a single piece of interesting dialogue at all. Secondly, the acting is awful. I used to like Kevin Costner, but after seeing such films as Waterworld, No Way Out, and now this, my opinion of his acting skills is much lower. About the only expressions Costner makes in this film are to smile and to stare at something.If you are looking to watch a good adventure movie, watch the Lord Of The Rings trilogy or Dances with Wolves etc., but whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH THIS Film!",The Postman

As a movie fan, I enjoy epics and I really did try to make it through the end of this one, but I could do it. The frequent assaults of corny dialogue, compiled with bad direction, finally got to me. There's probably enough corn in the lines of this movie to feed a third world country.**Spoiler warning** The only reason I stuck with this so long is because I figured there might be a decent final confrontation at the end. But no. Instead, what we get is a watered down wrestling match between Costner's ""Postman"" and Will Patton's bad guy general, followed by (you guessed it) even more corny dialogue. Will Patton's a good actor, but in this film, he gets stuck with the thankless task of playing a military meanie who seems to be brutal merely for the sake of making the audience hate him. This character would have been more at home in a Jean Claude Van Damme film. Just like this film would have been much better of not being made at all.",The Postman
152,Builders,Original and compelling,7,20 March 2006,"Except for about 20 minutes out of the last hour, Postman was a joy to watch. I found it very original and compelling, especially the Holnist camp images and the escape scenes. If this film hadn't preceded the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would say that it had copied the style and themes of LOR, in its musical score, photography, set locations, battles, etc. Since it came first however, I just applaud its artistic integrity and accomplishments. I haven't read the book, and the story wasn't written by Tolkein, but the picture of menacing evil ambition is consummately portrayed. I've never seen Will Patton before, but his General Bethlehem is an eye-opener. The movie's general insight into men's (and women's) conflicting motivations is quite good.I found the first 2 hours spotless and exhilarating, even if the insemination scene ruled out the possibility of my kids watching the whole film. Where does it come up short? I found Costner's postman not to be likable in the end. He seemed to be shamed into the good things he did. He had some kind of ""conversion"" at the Bridge City dam when a child demanded to know ""What's a postman?"" but did his character change? or just adapt? I tended to agree with General Bethlehem that the postman didn't believe in anything worth fighting for, and when the postman cried out, ""I believe in the United States of America"" (or whatever) it rang a little hollow, even if it won him the fight. So, the postman movement was over-emphasized (although Ford Lincoln Mercury was great) and the postman himself was too ambivalent about it.I think of this as one of Costner's concept movies, like Field of Dreams and Dances with Wolves. I really appreciate them, and the fact that they take you for an exciting ride, opening up new visions of our reality. Will he ever produce, direct and star in Cooper's ""The Red Rover""? I hope so.",The Postman

I like it!) and suchlike.Postman, however, bored me to death. It is too Kevin Costner, too long by far and way too sentimental. The scene when the Postman rides to deliver mail to a bunch of cheering kids (in slow motion!) had us laughing so hard we had to pause the movie.In the end, we fast-forwarded to the end and promised ourselves never to rent a Costner movie again. To this day I usually keep clear of any film with Costner in it. That really is unfair because I actually think he is a good actor and director. Postman, however, scarred me deeply.I am thinking of giving it another chance though, since I found surprisingly many positive comments here.

This film took such a panning from the critics that I almost didn't see it.Hence, it was purely by accident that I started watching it on the box one evening. I soon realised that far from being a pile of dross, the film was very enjoyable. OK, you shouldn't take it too seriously, and I'm not suggesting it receives posthumous Oscars, but I've seen nominated films that were far worse.The plot is a bit daft, but then that's pretty much par for the 'post apocalyptic' genre. So it's just as well it's all a tad 'tongue in cheek'. Costner is very good, the Production is excellent and the scenery fabulous. It's a bit long but surprisingly kept me engaged sufficiently to keep me up until the early hours even though I had work the following day.So, if you haven't seen it, turn off your prejudices (if you have them) and give it a go.

Also a great cameo performance from TOM PETTY...that's right kids TOM PETTY, whose acting skills are surprisingly just ok.Overall the film is semi-enjoyable but it is the kind of film you would only watch once and never again unlike 1995's the ice cream man which I am sure holds many hours rewatching(made up word on my behalf).

This movie could have easily been edited to be 15 or 20 minutes shorter without sacrificing any exposition at all.The modern staples of a good action-drama film are more or less non-existent in this film.

167,raptorsnest,A true underdog in the apocalyptic genre,7,19 July 2007,"The Postman....hailed as one of the worst movies ever that one Mr. Kevin Costner should be ashamed of, but I ask........why? When I see the Postman, I see a subtle told story of the end of the world. There are no wastelands of great cities. No horribly mutated zombies roaming about the landscape, no ""ultimate truth endings"" as so many of these genre pieces show. It simply tells the story of world barley clinging to life and of a man who unwittingly brings hope to a populace needing it desperately, and of another man who takes the words of a madman as gospel and becomes a tyrant.Don't get me wrong, something do hurt this film, the whole scene with the cabin and Abby could of been cut down or just done as a montage.They're should of been the big climatic battle between the Postmen's and Bethlehem's forces instead of their wrestling match....some more explanation of what actually happened to the country could of explained better....was it a bomb? A plague?, what was this war that Bethlehem speaks so fondly of? It is these sorts of thing makes the movie a tad confusing sometimes but still watchable.What the movie lacks in storytelling it more then makes more ii its visuals and acting, the beautiful Oregon country side where the film is mainly based, it just takes your breath away.Now I must say I am not the biggest fan of Kevin Costner but I must say he does an exceptional job here, as the Postman he plays a man who feels constantly awkward and embarrassed for his status and his lie as a hero of the people, his range goes form comedic, serious, insane at some points and courageous too, where as Will Patton plays the cold and poetic villain of Bethlehem, with array of unique characters through out the film evolution you will not get bored meeting new faces.While some may scoff at this film simply because it was too long or did not live up the standard of Costner's previous epic ""Dances with Wolves"" The Postman is a truly unique in the Post apocalypse genre and should be looked at with an open mind.

I assume that the vitriol Costner inspired with Waterworld carried over to this film. The cast is excellent, the direction superb, the camera work stunning and the acting brilliant.But it is the story that surprises the most. A loner that is trying to survive gets wrapped up in the anti-American revolution that has successfully destroyed American civilization. The loner eventually escapes, and dons a found postman's uniform and begins to deliver the mail found along with the uniform for personal gain (food).The hope he inspires eventually convinces him to fight the revolution, led by a very hard, evil and unfeeling man, and further hope is provided to the survivors of the United States.Personally, I think the attacks on this movie were politically motivated. The late 90s began the current wave of internal anti-American sentiments that the left is so fond of. It is no secret that most movie reviewers lean heavily to the left. A movie that speaks to the spirit of Americans and the inspiration the United States provides its citizens is not shockingly going to be panned.This movie is well worth watching.",The Postman

The first 45 minutes of the movie is nothing special, but as soon as he finds the Postman's uniform in the abandoned car; my attention is glued to the television to see what happens next. In order for an action movie such as this to work there must be an equally terrific villain; this movie has one in Will Patton.

People criticized The Postman simply because the bottom line of it is that you can't wait for someone else to solve your problems for you and that you must consider a greater good beyond yourself and in-turn take the brunt of things on oneself at times. Not a terribly exciting twist I know,but a fundamentally under-realized reality of not just this movie but life itself. When Costner's character first arrives masquerading as a postman on behalf of ""The Restored United States"" the people of the village bombard him with questions about ""the Marines"" or ""the President"" or other institutions in which they'd believed to which he responds by saying ""we've all got to do our bit"".He begins as an actor drifting from place to place and simply dons the outfit of a postman by chance, invents a back-story to support his new role and goes through the motions of delivering letters in exchange for sustenance i.e food and shelter. He has the initial luck on the way when by chance there just happens to be a letter in his stolen mail bag for someone in the village he arrives at-but not an implausible amount. From this beginning however his example inspires at first one young man who goes on to recruit his friends who now, because of Gordon, have something to believe in.

This was a fairly major box-office bust, but as with any film, I would suggest seeing it for yourself to see if you like it or not. This is easy to do on Netflix; if you're not into it, you can just stop it and try something else.The problems I found were the length — at almost 3 hours long, it was SLOW, at least much of the time 80-90 minutes would have been plenty, and would have made this a much tighter film — it's corny and unimaginative; no real subtlety here, too much predictability; Kevin Costner is in just about every scene, and, presumably because he was also the director, so there was no one to rein him in; the music was boring, cliché, and unimaginative, very much like the movie.And yet, I made it through to the film's conclusion, probably because I'm stubborn and wanted to see how it would end, and also because the basic premise is unusual — a dude's decision to impersonate a postman in a dystopian world somehow leads to redemption for a great many people.

The cross cuts are so clever it made my eyes ache with envy that i didnt think of them and the action sequences are fast and timed to perfection. this remains one of my favourite films and in all honesty people should give it a little more respect. no matter what you think of the script and characterisation technicly this film is top draw.

What I'd like to know is; do you guys really buy this stuff? I mean, this was not supposed to be parody, was it?So, the plot was thin and acting wasn't too good either. I even thought that Costner (who usually is quite good) wasn't at ease with his character. The movie would've felt ""tighter"" had it been a lot shorter as there were many periods during which nothing happened.There were some nice scenes and individual shots, but this whole idea of having a sort of ""mini-second civil war"" in 21st century post-apocalyptic world (or rather USA) was silly to say the least. 3/10.",The Postman

Hell, my brother who told me he hated it (yet never watched it) finally DID watch it and enjoyed it.  I am sorry to say that the critics are wrong this time around.  The only thing I didnt care for was the length of it.  Mabe if they could have trimmed 15-25 minutes, it would appeal a lot more.  Also do you notice the massive amount of reviews here that DO in fact like this film!  Just rent the film and you will hopefully see what I mean.

While I'm still not fond of Mr. Costner, there is no doubt in my mind that he is a fabulous director and a wonderful eye.  The character he seems to always play fits quite well into this film, and I was easily wrapped up in the story.  There were several moments that would have been just too over the top in 1997, but that, in these desperate times, are much needed.

Settle down for the evening and enjoy a decent story, beautiful photography and a pretty heart warming story.  The violence is way less than your standard Die Hard or such.On the downside it is a bit too long - perhaps 20 minutes or so.

191,simon-orourke-876-303604,Story telling with ethics rather than action with a thud,10,21 December 2013,"Having seen this film many time since its release, I am surprised the rating is not higher. This film is old-fashioned story-telling at its best, rather than bite-sized action sequences in three courses. Those with the expectations of seeing Dances With Wolves II, or potentially its evil twin Waterworld II, would have been disappointed, perhaps as much as a friend was once disappointed when he discovered that ""The Deer Hunter"" was not ""Rambo"".This film has an inspirational soundtrack that flies high above the maudlin and struggling townships. Its cinematography and special effects are filled as much with the craggy, raggedy and washed-out countenances of the characters, as with the contrasting beauty of mother nature's snowy mountains, rivers, jagged forests and sun streaked purple clouds.This film has a great deal of thoughtful almost theatrical dialogue, whether timely quotations from Shakespeare's Henry V or as original dialogue questioning the age-old theme of why we do the things that we do--how fate may intervene in our path, and how we react or respond to those changes. At a key moment in the film, the character played by Olivia Williams says to the 'The Postman' played by Kevin Costner that he gives out hope like candy, that he has a gift for this, and which sums up the purpose of his character, the main catalyst of the film. Like the best of Hitchcock, Kevin Costner often plays the type of character who is the everyday modern man thrown into an unusual or heightened and dangerous situation.The premise behind the story is no more far fetched than the Symposium of Plato--the world has a long history of epic disasters. This film is for anyone who has ever given their time to a higher cause. Anyone who has ever worked in a not-for-profit organization will recognize the difficulties of building up a community when others seek, with the 'best' of intentions, to tear it down, to destroy or infect others with self-interest. The characters of Kevin Costner and his adversary Will Paton both realized that the true battle is the battle to win hearts and minds to the right cause. Contrast again the fast moving figures riding through the hills and valleys of its wide-open scenic depths, some for blood and wealth and some to unite the country through communication and meaning.Some people are often critical, to a very personal degree, of certain outspoken actors such as Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe--the actors are entitled to their views, they have made some great films, and so to their critics it is time to give it a rest. Watch this film if optimism is your preferred drink.",The Postman
192,nshafe,Very good show...,8,27 July 2006,"I really like this show...It is an interesting twist on a nuclear aftermath. Kevin Costner is a very good actor and portrays a man who is drifting around and acts like a Postman to get into a camp for some food and shelter. He then falls deeper and must confront what he does not want. This story takes place in the northwest so the towns are surrounded by woods and mountains. Beautiful scenery... Of course there are militia types who are bad guys But this is no Mad max or Road Warrior type show. There are a couple of cool cameos and the show really picks up speed after the first half hour or so, but you get into it and start to see characters develop, and people come together..

All they have to eat is grass and melted snow. On the verge of starvation she shoots and butchers a horse. Wait. It gets better. After a couple of days he is strong enough to run out of the deserted house they are holed up in and drag her out of an icy river. They bumble along, rally the good guys. Then the Postman, to save his protégé, challenges the mean leader of the evil forces to a mano-a-mano in front of everyone. The ending then dissolves into pure Walt Disney.

And just like waterworld he failed.If you like to see a good movie about a lonesome guy wandering in a post apocalyptic desert, go see 'Mad Max the Road Warrior'.Okay, in this one Kevin comes up with a more original story than Waterworld (the story of Waterworld was just stolen from the ""Road Warrior"").On the other hand, waterworld was still enjoyable as a simple action-adventure movie. 'The postman' however is just boring and pretentious.Kevin Costner may try as hard as he can, he will never be the mean guy and hero-against-his-will-type like Mel-'Mad Max'-Gibson was.The postman is a three hour-long torture of stupid dialogues, bombastic symbolism and self-glorification.I even feel pity for Tom Petty.

197,nick220997,(Maybe) the best film ever made!,10,8 April 2006,"""A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step"" ""Opportunities are all around you"" ""Nothing takes the past away, like the future"" ""Life deserves a chance""These are the feelings I was left with after the end of the film. In a post-apocalyptic America law an order has vanished. People live in small towns, with no contact with the outside world and terrorised by warlords who roam the countryside. They expect nothing and if they're alive it's just because they happened to be.The postman (Costner) is an ordinary guy who wants to do something with his life. Not knowing what that would be he travels around the country giving performances of Shakespeare. He gets pressed-ganged by warlord Bethlehem, who rules his men with fear. While the others are too afraid to run away, Costner gives life a chance. He then finds a fifteen years old post bag and exhausted of Bethlehem's chase he pretends to be a postman of ""the restored government"", in order to be accepted in a town. This is enough to change the world...The delivery of letters from long forgotten relatives reminds the inhabitants of the life they used to have. Suddenly they find an interest in life  to write letters to the lost loved-ones and wait for news from them. But a young boy wants more and asks to become a postman himself. The next time Costner meets him, the lad has established a proper postal service, manned with young people with a thirst for life...Having found an interest in life the people gradually come to understand how nice it is to be alive. From then it's only a matter of time until they decide that they deserve better than being terrorised by psycho warlords like Bethlehem...What I particularly liked in this film is that it's not about a great leader who defeats the bad guys, or does something good for the people. The postman does nothing and the people's lives change exactly because they do it themselves - once they only decide to. This is about the power of hope, the power of ""getting out and do something"", the power of ""taking things in your own hands"", the power of believing in yourself. This is about the blessing of life.The last scene, where years later the statue of the postman is revealed and the crowd applauds (I couldn't help joining in), clearly implies that the end of Bethlehem was only the beginning of even better things, in the same way the first arrival of the postman once was. Making life better can become a habit... I was shocked to read that the critics didn't like this film.",The Postman
198,tony etchells,"See it, then decide",9,15 August 2002,"It's a depressing fact that the moviegoing public is being brainwashed by critics to hate everything involving Kevin Costner. When released in 1997 this breathtaking, thought-provoking epic was largely ignored and limped to a box office gross of $14 million, thanks to some vicious reviews.Lest we forget, Costner made the magnificent Dances With Wolves, but that was in the days when we were told it was okay to like him. His directorial follow up is every bit as good.  He knows about directing.  He coaxes great performances from his casts. He has real vision and takes chances. Like Michael Cimino, his efforts are belittled and mocked while directors with clearly less talent are applauded.So to all those people who stayed away in droves and screw their faces up at the mention of this film, I say watch it before you criticise it.

It was so incredibly cheesy at points that I thought I was going to have a coronary. There is a certain piece in the ending scenario that makes it about as cheesy as a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film, but I can't tell you, because you will just have to watch all eight hours of it.

The movie plot is very good, differences from the novel are welcome, and the characters are outstanding. Wish I saw Olivia Williams' character Abby in more movies, she is absolutely great. Patton's General Bethlehem is magnificent as the bad guy. Costner's determined and adaptive character reminds me of Deckard in Blade Runner. Ribisi is irreplaceable as the involuntarily funny yet stupid bandit. Tate's Ford Lincoln Mercury is a sparkle. Postman's dialogue with Tom Petty's character (""I know you.

202,jkemmery-753-721518,The Postman: Much Better than the critcs' opinions,8,20 March 2015,"I thought I would write a review of this movie because it's a prime example of how, in my humble opinion, the critics often get it wrong, and really wrong. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its flaws, I'll get to those later, but it also has a couple of pretty amazing acting performances, and quite a few others that are very good. These would not be Kevin Costner's however. Kevin Costner plays 1990's Kevin Costner, which was probably part of this film's undoing with the critics in the first place: they were getting sick of him, and assumed the movie going public was too. An outstanding acting performance is turned in by Will Patton as the antagonist General Bethlehem, a sadistic warlord who rules his ""troops"" with an iron fist while regaling himself in the pretenses of having culture due to his love of literature and music. Another pretty amazing performance is Giovani Ribisi as one of Bethlehem's minions who is mentally challenged and unstable and makes every effort to ingratiate himself to his superiors, who seem all to willing to ignore him until they can take advantage of his eagerness. There are also very good performances by Laranz Tate, as Ford Lincoln Mercury, the would be protégé of Costner's title character, Olivia Williams as Costner's love interest, and Daniel Von Bargen, as the sheriff of the small town caught in the middle of the struggle between Costner's Postman and Patton's Bethlehem. It's a shame that the critics tend to like to focus on the negative, and in doing so all but dismiss the incredible acting done by these actors, among many others in the film. The film does get a little heavy handed near the end, and the final scene unveiling the statue of Costner as ""The Postman"" probably sealed the film's fate with the critics. It can be a little slow in parts, but that normally doesn't last too long, and there are a couple of different parables about modern life and human nature intertwining that are interesting and add to the enjoyment of the movie beyond the excellent acting of the supporting cast.This film could be a study in how American critics in general, and movie critics in particular fail to do their jobs in directing audiences to movies that are worth their time and money. Compare this movie to say, Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"", and it is superior in every way, yet due to it's initially poor critical response, still is rated far lower, and yet is a far better movie by almost any standard.If you enjoy great acting, complex parables and are willing to endure a few slow spots and a bit of over-the-top sentimentality and ego stroking in the last 10 minutes, this would be a rewarding film for you to watch, regardless of what the critics or a few of your clueless friends might tell you. Also, if you're a Tom Petty fan, you will get to see one of his very few live action acting performances, and while not great, is not bad either.",The Postman

I liked the film when I first saw it on the big screen in 1997, although I admit, it could have used a good dose of editing. The audience had seemed receptive too. However, the film suffered from the critical backlash that followed Costner's other epic flop, Waterworld. Costner had become ""box office poison"" and the public wasn't buying. The Postman was too hopeful, too saccharine, too human, too grounded for the apocalyptic sci-fi genre. It was also a little too sci-fi for the epic genre. But to me, the inability to pigeon hole it is part of its attraction. I don't care for films about aliens and zombis.Perhaps today, audiences are ready for something a little different - a cautionary tale with a little decency and hope to counter the negativity and divisiveness of the Trump era.

Dark and totally unpredictable (the unpredictability is a good thing), the movie starts out a bit too slow for my tastes, but eventually ramps up in both plot line and suspense to where I was literally on the edge of my seat several times.

In particular, I though that using the ""building up postal services"" to show how communication works against dictatorship was a genial idea.  In fact, since old days it is said that you should ""divide to conquer"" and isolating people from each other is one way of dividing them.

208,camlannx,"A good film, but not a war movie",7,6 December 1999,"There's a scene in the first hour of this movie that sums up whether you're the kind of movie fan who will like it or not:  a group of conscripts is bunking down after a hard day's training as infantrymen.  For R&R their warlord puts on a reel from ""Universal Soldier"".  It is booed off the projector and replaced by what they wanted to see, ""The Sound of Music"". This is not a movie about the thrills and chills of combat.  It is about the sentimental nature of patriotism, a study of different political ideals, a morality play, and like many recent Costner films it is a biography about a reluctant but conscientious hero who rises to greatness accidentally.  This is a film for people who really enjoy recognizing quotations from Henry V, Richard III, and Hamlet in an old episode of Star Trek.  Star Trek buffs will love this movie. Steven Seagal buffs will fall asleep after the first thirty minutes.I gave it a 7 because although I enjoyed the cinematography, the romanticism, and the poly sci case study of feudalism vs democracy I was a little put off by Costner's overindulgence in melodramatic scenes.  The film also took itself too seriously too often, and should have cut some syrupy scenes and spliced in a little more witty comic relief.  It is much more like ""Wyatt Earp"" than ""Dances with Wolves"".  The scenery alone, on the other hand, would inspire patriotic awe in anyone who's been out West. Although frank about the grim reality of a world without technology (plague, starvation, brutality) it is refreshing to see places without punk rock, gridlock, or jaded self-absorbed teenagers.  Where else could you see a lion roaming the Utah Salt flats, a strip mine turned into a fortress, and a dam turned into a city gate?One other category of moviegoer will want to avoid this movie, too.

216,Paul-93,Media Influence,8,16 September 1998,"Living in London, England, I considered myself fortunate to see both The Postman and Titanic during a trip to Canada before the aforementioned movies were even being promoted in the UK.  At the end of my visit, I left Canada with the knowledge that I had seen two mega-budget movies (which I was certain were bound to be blockbusters) before the majority of the UK cinemagoing public.On my return, I was pleased to pass on my emphatic reviews of both movies to my friends and family.  In truth, I actually preferred The Postman. However, the negative media reviews in the build up to the release of ""The Postman"" made certain that it was only to be seen by the smallest minority of British cinemagoers.  Admittedly a Costner fan but with bias aside, I still can't believe the public can honestly say that The Postman fails in it's goal to succeed on a entertainment level.  If it does, then surely it couldn't fall much further behind the likes of Batman And Robin, Lost In Space, Mission: Impossible or The Lost World all of which performed phenomenally more successful at the box office but were hardly the white-knuckle rides they aspired to be. 
Shouldn't it be down to the public to decide the success of a movie, not the mindless herd of critics who always seem to, coincidentally, agree with each other.   It seems that all too easily, a movie's success can be determined by what the media has to say about it.  Especially the Costner movies - remember how the media tried their best to scupper Waterworld's chances at the box office.  My grievance lies with the fact that the media seemed content to spend so much time focusing on the fact that it was Costner's second directorial outing rather concentrating on the movie's own merits or shortcomings. They appeared so desperate to trash The Postman, they resorted to the simplest and most noticeable of comparisons between the lack of serious themes, compared to the humanitarian issues tackled in ""Dances With Wolves "".  From what I can recall, even the media's favourite director - Steven Spielberg, has been know to flit between the thought provoking, dramatical storylines and the gung-ho action genre eg. Schinder's List (1993), The Lost World (1997).  What are they saying?  It's OK for Spielberg to diversify but not for Costner?Mel Gibson, be warned!",The Postman

219,HenCat,Far-fetched but worth the effort,8,23 May 2001,"I saw The Postman on TV recently. Once you suspend your disbelief in the far-fetched givens of the story, it is a great movie to immerse yourself in even if you've seen any number of other post-WW3 fantasies. I didn't find it over-long, in fact the length helps the experience by shutting out the real world longer, which in turn helps one who thinks 'yeah right' about the whole sub-genre of post-WW3-dom to change their mind and relax.",The Postman

Sure there are lots of close-ups of Kev but, hey!, I didn't mind! What I did mind was the overly patriotic bits. I'm not American, thank God, and so am not impressed by Americans and their heart-on-the-sleeve mentality. In general, I think they're the most over-rated (mostly by themselves) people on Earth. The ending, with its white, middle class, conservative vision of future society spoiled what is, otherwise, a really good action flick. The acting is very good throughout. Costner, unlike that other Kevin he's worked with, has the knack of getting the absolute best out of ALL the cast. The main characters are utterly believable and the bit players aren't allowed to fall into the Reynolds trap of over-acting. Costner's use of the camera is, I think, second to none. A lot of the time, the actors don't need to act, the camera does it for them. There have been many criticisms of the script but few seem to recall that the original premise was written by David Brin, not Kevin Costner.I have watched this movie many times. Now I just skip the final scene with the statue. The rest of it is just so well made. It's an epic and, for the most part, one KC can be proud of.",The Postman

I think most people find the plots hard to understand simply because they aren't the pre-package plots that they're used to.  Films like Dances with Wolves, Water World, and The Postman all transport the viewer to an alternate reality that have a strange nostalgic familiarity.  In any case, The Postman clearly realizes the Costner ideal of the defiant individual discovering the possibility of overcoming his current situation and offering the world a chance to save itself.  Simple, but still powerful.  That's why I enjoy his more traditional movies, even if they are more like epics.",The Postman

My friend said he found it quite good and asked if I would like to decide for myself? We all sat down and watched it. I was really not looking forward to 3 hrs of a crappy movie. I got caught up in it and ended up loving it. I think part of it was because of the low expectation. I love seeing movies that turn out better than I thought. This is now one of ""my favorite movies you never saw"". I since bought the DVD and can not wait to show it to someone else that missed it because of the KC haters. I am still not sure what that is all about. I think Mel Gibson is getting the same treatment now. Another of ""my favorite movies you never saw"" is also a Costner ""The War"" see it.",The Postman

If memory serves, the cause of the apocalypse is not made clear, it is not important, but whatever the event was, the impact of it was worsened with severe droughts and food shortage.The baddies are the Holnists (named after their dead founder Nathan Holn) - an army led by Will Patton's excellently played character, General Bethlehem, a terrifyingly cruel man that has no mercy and was never in the army before the apocalypse (look out for the reveal of his job before the apocalypse is one of many lighthearted moments in the film).The goodies are led by Kevin Costner's never-named accidental hero, a self appointed postman, ""The Postman"".One of my favourite films.

228,it-breathes-on-its-own,Good clean fun,5,19 February 2009,"I bought a used copy of this movie recently, because it was cheap, has some sentimental value to me (major parts were filmed where I grew up) and I remembered liking it as a kid.It's an epic, which means, in this case, it's a bit overlong and filled with a lot of overly sentimental corny lines. I found all the Shakespeare references to be particularly pretentious, but in a humorous way. At good points, the movie achieves the look and feel of Doctor Zhivago, and I felt Costner had some aspirations to that level of epic film-making when he did this.The story itself is interesting, even though its end of the world scenario seems an almost typically 90s kind of fantasy--backwoods militia types inspired by a fascist motivational speaker do... whatever it is they did. The patriotism of the movie was actually one of my favorite parts, even though I don't usually go for that sort of thing. It has a good-natured, pacifistic Jimmy Stuart sort of patriotism to it rather than the violent selfish jingoism of, say, a Mel Gibson-style war movie. This is one, I guess, that is much too corny for me to really enjoy (except as a joke), but that I'd not have second thoughts about showing to my kids someday despite its ridiculous R rating.",The Postman

Some people have disregarded him as an actor in recent years & unfortunately this movie has been over looked by most people.If you are looking for Costner acting as Robin Hood or think this film may be like Dances with Wolves you will be pleasantly surprised that this is a completely different role for him.The movie is set in post apocalyptic America were human civilization in the US and possibly the world is destroyed. The film takes you on a journey with Costners character traveling across America and finds his purpose in being The Postman.The movie is long however, I believe that there is never a dull moment. All characters you can connect with on a certain level and as the movie unfolds I found myself wondering if this is what the world would turn into if everything went wrong.I recommend this movie to all that have not seen this and also ask people to give it another go!

230,krangbrain,one of the greatest comedies ever made,5,1 May 2005,"What an extremely laughable post apocalyptic stolen theme movie. I would compare this masterpiece to two other classics of extreme distaste and fun: the first would be beyond thunder dome. Postman does not quite measure up to thunder dome; although the mad max adventure story has it's moments where you are laughing and its not the intended reaction the filmmakers were hoping for- moments of laughing with the filmmakers, or smiling at clever points and the boyish appeal of ""two man enter one man leave"" help you forgive awkward moments. The Postman however, contains none of these elements. This is where I draw my comparison to a second film. the movie ""SHowgirls"" starring jesse from saved by the bell, is the only movie i can think of that compares with the postman in its particular brand of humor. Don't allow the layers of clichés to fool you, there is a funny and entertaining film here if you look beneath the surface. the moments that ring the truest are when the music and the dramatic beats build up and the pay off usually has something to do with the heroics of the reformed postal service. This movie clocks in at nearly 3 hours so the moments of extreme humor abound, don't believe all the hype go see postman.-",The Postman
231,Piggy6756,A much better film than people give it credit for.,7,12 June 2012,"I also think this film is far better than its reviews suggest. The photography, for one thing, is beautiful, showcasing as it does the North West American wilderness.More than this, and the reason why I cut the film a great deal of slack, is its moral core. Costner's character, at a difficult point in his life in this dystopian future, discovers a wrecked mail van, puts on the dead driver's jacket, and decides to deliver the mail to the nearest community as a way to scrounge a meal and a bed for the night. Quite against his expectations he strikes a chord with the community he visits, and they give him mail to deliver to their loved ones whom they have not spoken to in years. So he starts a mail service for his own benefit, but as he brings people messages from people they thought were dead he also brings them hope that life will get better and in the process he becomes a better man.There is a violent conclusion to the movie, but it is not the violence that revives the community but someone bringing people closer together via the mail. For that reason in particular I look kindly on this movie.",The Postman
232,bloodystool-1,"Postage Declined (The lying ""Postman"")",2,7 May 2005,"At this point I'm still struggling to catch my breath after ingesting this quasi-epic masterpiece from our man ""THE Cos"". I recently read a riveting interview with said Cos where he compared his pitiful Oscar groveling bomb to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" while calling his alleged Postman a mythical hero... WOW!!! Let me get this straight. So the world has pretty much come to an end (except for the plentiful lush forest settings), most of mankind is wiped out and taken over by a mad band of fascist braveheart-style warriors. People are down, they're out, they scratch and claw for the basic essentials of human survival... food, clean water. Their spirits must to be lifted in order to maintain the will to go on. Who could possibly achieve such a momentous task among such despair? Kevin Costner with an electric bill from 2002. Obviously. So here he is, apparently bored enough to bring back the IL' postal service therefore delivering unity to the masses. Of course, Kevin. Here's 70 million dollars, start shooting in the spring. Anyway, along the way he impersonates a federal employee while publicly claiming to have close correspondence with the President of the United States who is currently operating out of the ""Metrodome... where the Vikings used to play"". All this in order to recruit a rag tag posse of wanna be ""Postmen"" who have a tendency to gather in large groups to bask in the glory of their virtuous leader before and after working a hard day in a makeshift mail sorting facility for three LONG hours. Wait a second Kevin. On second thought, I want my 70 million back! So let me make sure that I have this right... He's basically a non-truthful, dishonest, delusional, misleading, egocentric, self-centered, less than forthright, and down right lying for lack of a better term... ""Postman"". Due do his not quite honest approach to team building many young, dead, pretend postmen littered the post-apocalyptic landscape. Bravo, Kevie, BRAVO!! I've followed suit with the film and built a large statue of the lion hearted Costner galloping bravely toward some sort of postalocracy ruling the new Metrodome based government with Big-Cos at the Helm. It sits in my front yard inspiring all who look upon it. So kick back, clear three hours from your schedule, and prepare for a rip roarin' laugh fest.

I walked out when Costner (bland by his standards) stumbles across Tom Petty and the script gives a cringe-worthy nod to Petty's rock n roll past. Add in some stomach churning waving around of the stars and stripes, and you have one big turkey of a film crying out to have it's neck ringed .A truly appalling film.

''Ride, Postman, Ride!'' As for the comment earlier that ''we were told'' not to like Kevin Costner's direction anymore, hard to believe.

238,Kimagure-3,An enjoyable patriotic movie requiring an appreciative audience,10,22 February 1999,"From reading prior comments, it seems that a lot of people have a hang-up about Waterworld (or about Kevin Costner).  The Postman is a wholly different movie with an epic scope (more so than Road Warrior to which it's compared), higher levels of cinematography, multiple scenes of highly choreographed actions, and an anti-hero who assumes the hero position rather than remaining an anti-hero at the end of the movie.So why do so many people hate it?  From the negative comments, a lot of people didn't seem to understand it or if they did, they did not appreciate the patriotic wistfulness of the plot.The Postman was an excellent two-part set of science-fiction short stories first published in an anthology magazine.  The pair of shorts had such promise that they were combined and an extended ending sequence was added.In print form, the story and plot are appealing since the reader is able to bring his or her cognitive processes to bear on the patriotic aspects of the self-fulfilling prophecy of a man who inadvertently unifies a broken region of cynical people.The symbol of a postal service is a strong ICONIC reminder of the lovable past that was lost to the inhabitants and the awakened patriotic emotions lead to a better life for everyone (except the cynical survivalist holnists).I enjoyed the short story version the most for its epic enigmatic ending, but feared the day the movie optioned book would make it to the screen. Would a thinking man's epic movie make a financially successful movie or not?  It is hard to tell in these cynical times whether or not a movie can kindle feelings of patriotism without resorting to huge amounts of special effects in space.",The Postman

Sure, Mr. Costner took a little artistic license with regards to occurrences in the book, but that's allowable.A very good friend of mine played Sheriff Briscoe (Daniel von Bargen), and I would still give this movie a favorable review even if I didn't know someone in it.

The first time I was a little taken back by the brutality and the seemingly randomness of the script. The second time I began to understand the message and the 3rd time I figured I knew this character pretty well. Costner's idea of hope being eternal and the fortitude of man after WWIII was a testimony to his personal beliefs that good will win every time. I felt the supporting actors did well, though could've been more evil. Costner is knocked a bit by critics because of his artsy ideas and executions of scripts. This movie rates highly in my book for the simple fact that it portrayed a seemingly selfish and unmotivated man who became a hero without any doing of his own. And through it all he grew up. That was Fate in action. Good story line, good ending. A little soft on romance, but maybe that's what he intended. Definetely a see again with a mature audience.",The Postman

Not only does it have a solid script, solid direction and solid acting, it even has the potential to still surprise you after several viewings, which is a pretty rare thing among big budget flicks.What I like so much about this movie is that it has so many symbols in it that become more and more relevant to the world we in live in as time progresses.The post-apocalyptic setting is very well though out: Some neat gadgets from civilization are still around (zippos, uniforms, guitars), yet as a viewer you get a sense for how much things are missing now that people formerly considered to be standard (communication, social networking, visions for the future). They never missed it till it really was gone forever.The postman, while starting off by just pretending to be a postman, quickly becomes a symbol of hope for the struggling survivors, as he presents them a way to regain what seemed to be lost: a way to unify in order to fight the terror that reigns their world in the form of General Bethlehem.This unification can only happen because people manage to organize some form of communication again. The whole movie could be seen as a wise and modern illustration of the good old saying that ""the feather can be mightier than the sword"".Living in a world where playing with the option of nuclear holocaust becomes more fashionable than ever, you can't but feel haunted by one of the films central dialogue lines: ""Terror will defeat reason.""

I read one of the comment saying how bad this movie is because it got 5 Razzies. First I laughed, then I was sad. So many people cannot make a judgment on their own. If you can't like a movie because it got Razzies, and if you always like movies who get Oscars, you should not express your opinion because we already know it.This is not the perfect movie.

The editing is dreadful, as whole scenes turn up in completely the wrong places. The ""God Bless America"" style of chest beating is absolutely stomach-turning, and just sends the film into one tailspin after another.

I know that some of you just can't stand the fact that there's no futuristic army battles, no 600 horsepower car chases, and ""Iron armored costumes"" I honestly think that's how the world would go if all government and basic infrastructure were brought down. Think about it. What would you do? Drive a 600 horsepower, supercharged dune buggy that gets 3 mpg or ride a horse. Gasoline supplies would deplete after about a month. Hoarding gas will not work. (it goes bad after about a year of storage) Most people raised in big cities would starve within a couple of months due to lack of survival education or tyranny by people with guns.Secondly, In the film, Costner ends up being the hero in the way that real hero's do. Hero's aren't the people who are tough and beautiful. They're people who are forced into a situation and do the best they can. He starts the new government purely by accident. The only real mistake I see in this movie is that in the beginning, Costner is portrayed as being weak and unable to defend himself. In reality he would be in extremely good shape strong as an ox and very wily. (he's been dragging a mule around for years. Try that sometime.

My problems with the movie are about half related to the film adaptation from David Brinn's book and half execution of the film itself... speaking of execution, somebody should have put this one out of its misery during the development phase. #1 nit... Read the book.  David Brinn spun a very convincing yarn (ok... a few not so plausable parts, too) of a post apocolypic America.  In the story the Postman is a con artist, a likable con artist, but still a con artist, throughout much of the book.  His contact with the village/town of corvallis both inspires him and ultimately comes close to destroying what little faith he has in humanity.  (there's a lot more that could be made on this central and pivital plot of the story... so read the book!) #2 nit execution of the story.  The story flows badly.  The plot does a poor job of making the explanations plausable. It didn't bother me that the movie was 3 hours ( I've watched longer and enjoyed them), but it bothered me that those were not an enjoyable 3 hours.

269,mikestone1948,"Great Movie, Unjustly Panned",10,2 August 2021,"Kevin Costner's movie version of David Brin's sf novel (or rather, mainly the first of its three sections) has had a decidedly bad press, but looking back from 2021 it is difficult to see why.Set in a near-future America devastated by a nuclear/biological war, it follows the fortunes of an itinerant who wanders around the scattered townships which remain, in the hope of finding one to take him in. He doesn't have much luck on that score, as most already have as many people as they can support, until he gets an unexpected break. He finds the remains of a US postman, with a bag of old mail some of which, providentially, is addressed to people in the next town at which he calls.Costner secures admission by claiming to be a a real postman, working for a (fictionally) restored US government. He is met with some scepticism, especially by the local sheriff, but enough people believe him to encourage him to keep up the masquerade.However, his hopes are quickly dashed by the arrival of the Bad Guys, a self-appointed militia group called Holnists, who roam around exacting tribute (and conscripts) from the townships They are led by one General Bethlehem, who does not appear in the book. The Holnists as a movement do, but there are important differences in the movie version. Bethlehem is decidedly racist, rejecting one draftee for being of Asian origin, and closely inspecting another for possible Black ancestry. His men even kill and eat Costner's mule, because a cross-breed of horse and donkey has no place in the New Order. In the book, by contrast, we are explicitly told that their founder, Nathan Holn, was *not* a racist. Though Brin's Holnists follow a ""Might Is Right"" philosophy, and practice a form of serfdom, this does not appear to be on racial lines.This is my one real grumble about the film, which I feel overdoes it a bit, turning the Holnists into cardboard villains. Thus when Bethlehem rides into town, he immediately starts conscripting, without the slightest effort to find volunteers. Yet in this situation, he could probably get quite a few, given that most young men there may well have few job options other than unmechanised farm labour, ie a lifetime contemplating the south ends of northbound mules. Compared to that, service under Bethlehem might really not seem so bad Yet in the film the only character who expresses that view is shown as a dimwit, hardly above the level of the village idiot. Here I feel the movie ""cheats"" a little, passing over the motives of those who accepted the Holnist life. After all, Nathan Holn's original followers must have had some reason for following him.However, for me at least this nitpick is more than offset by the touching (and revealing) scene at the film show, where Bethlehem's men indignantly reject Universal Soldier in favour of The Sound of Music. Clearly the Holnist rank and file - even willing ones who accept their life as the ""least worst"" of a rotten set of options - still pine for the happier and gentler things that they have lost, and would welcome an alternative if they saw one. In a way, they too are victims. This provides an explanation of their behaviour at the end of the film, where things that Costner has learned during his time with the Holnists will play a crucial part in enabling him to defeat Bethlehem.But that's in the future. More immediately, Costner escapes from the Holnists and hides out with his future wife, who eventually (and somewhat forcefully) persuades him to come back to town. On arrival, he finds that he has really started something. The young people of the townships are worshipping him as a hero and organising themselves into a postal service for the whole area. Indeed, it emerges later that he has admirers far beyond the immediate precincts, with others having set up a similar service for a ""Restored Republic of California"". We are never told whether this republic really exists or is just a fiction similar to his own, but it hardly matters now. The movement is in full swing.Needless to say, Bethlehem is not best pleased by any of this, and sees all too clearly the danger to him which the postmen present. He launches all out war, and as the casualties mount, Costner looks on in horror and attempts to call the whole thing off. But this ship has already sailed. His young ""disciples"" have the bit between their teeth and will not take no for an answer. Costner has made his bed and must lie in it, come what may.And more does come. The enthusiasm of the young Postmen starts to captivate their elders, who also rally round. In one scene, reminiscent of a WW2 drama, the Sheriff of Pineview, who had once (correctly) dismissed the Postman as an obvious fraud, now defiantly shouts ""Ride, Postman, ride!"" as he and his fellow townsfolk are mown down by a Holnist firing squad. The fire is well and truly lit.I have seen some criticism of the way the townsfolk are allegedly portrayed as ""sheep"" knuckling under to the Holnists until hero-boy comes along, John Wayne style, to set the example. To me though, all this indicates is that Costner has been lucky in his timing. Had he come on the scene ten years earlier, a populace still demoralised from the apocalypse would not have followed him. Ten years later, and he would not have led them to victory because someone else would already have done it. As it is, he has arrived at the critical point, where the townsfolk have recovered enough to take on the Holnists, but haven't fully realised it yet. Costner is the trigger rather than the bomb.All in all, I find it a great movie, and certainly far superior to the epidemic of disaster films with which we have been bombarded since, with their ice ages, earthquakes and of course asteroid and meteor impacts ad nauseam. Those who panned when it first came out might perhaps have been cautioned that ""You ain't seen nuffin yet."" Like those who welcomed Henry VIII as a great relief after his father's tyranny, little did they know what they had coming.",The Postman
270,projectile-106-490735,"Great, underrated but not perfect.",9,25 July 2015,"As a whole I love this film. The premise of the story was probably the best thing about the film. I would certainly like to read the book if there is one. This movie could have been improved with better editing and changes to the dialogue. There is a bit of exposition here and there that rankled with me a tiny bit. A few of the minor characters gave some unconvincing performances but on the whole the acting was decent enough. It was certainly the editing that let the film down. Realistically it probably could have done with being longer since certain stages of the story seemed rushed. I would love to see this as a series. The soundtrack is very well orchestrated and in places contributed massively to the emotional build ups. The main musical theme was almost identical to the one from 'The Castaway' and there are also similarities in some of the symbolism (Obviously this film came first). Some of the costuming at the very end was a bit strange. I certainly recommend this film!

271,k-grenier-193-528927,Greatly undervalued by the critics,8,5 April 2015,"I have found that there is quite a difference between Sci Fi, fantasy and horror fans. You can put fantasy or horror in a futuristic setting, but that doesn't make it Science Fiction. The Postman is a true Sci Fi movie, loved by real Sci Fi fans, but not as much by anyone else. For the real future visionary, this is an excellent movie with wonderful acting. In particular, Will Patton plays a fantastic antagonist. The setting is well done and really makes you feel like you are there. It is one of my favorite movies.*** If you are wondering about the differences between Sci Fi, Fantasy and Horror, read on. Fantasy is generally about an overlooked character becoming a hero either by right-of-birth, accidentally gaining a special power, or just by being in the right place at the right time. It can be in a futuristic setting or quite often a medieval time. It usually involves some mystical power that can't be explained, but who cares, that's not what draws us to fantasy. Star Wars is a perfect example. Most people enjoy at least a little fantasy. Horror is a story geared to give you a rush by making you jump. Again, it can be set in the future, past or present. It generally doesn't have the vision which attracts most Sci Fi fans. If you prefer H.G. Wells and Alien to Jules Verne and Star Trek, then you are probably more of a horror fan than Sci Fi, although there are some people who like both. True Science Fiction is the telling of visionary stories giving us an idea of possible futures. Of course there is still a lot of fiction, there has to be in the unknown, but the idea is to make it as realistic as possible. If you are a fan of Jules Verne, Issac Asimov, Gene Roddenberry, David Brin, Greg Bear, Michael Crichton, J.J. Abrams, Stargate Universe and time twists in general, then you are probably a Sci Fi Fan and will LOVE The Postman.

The Postman made the debut in São Paulo theaters after winning the Worst Picture Razzie, and as a movie fan, I went to check two days after the debut if it did really have the ""qualities"" for such award.  The movie theater was occupied by me and another eyewitness, which is a bad sign since the city has more than 10 million inhabitants.Well, the idea was good, a man wandering through the wastelands of a post apocalyptic world and is captured by a horde of barbarians who try to draft him to their army.  He escapes and tries, involuntarily, to restore civilization and battle the barbarians.  This should be a good movie, but nope, it isn't.  Costner was not convincing as a hero in Waterworld, and is even less convincing here, his work as a director here is weak and the script is silly, sentimentalist and unrealistic.  And hey, re-establishing the postal service might be a necessary condition to restore civilization, but it isn't enough to restore completely the civilization.Still the best post apocalyptic movie is Mad Max, because it didn't have a tenth of the presumption displayed in The Postman. It did not deserve the Razzies, but still it isn't a good movie.",The Postman

287,yako 666,A contender for the title worst film ever made...,1,31 January 2001,"The Postman is, put quite simply, an atrocious film -- with a rambling, confused narrative, poor dialogue, and ideas above its station. The pretentiousness of this ""epic"" is staggering, and padded out with bad poetry, the film has that ""will the torture never end?"" quality concomitant with bad movies. Not that there's anything wrong with long movies, if length is required by plot and material; but Costner has confused over-long with epic (does the bloated story really merit its treatment? does Shakespeare deserve to be defiled in this manner?); and its running time has affected its form to the point that watching the film, with its seemingly indefinitely delayed anti-climax, is comparable to hacking one's way through Sleeping Beauty's forest with a pair of nail clippers. The only reason to watch this: to see how badly made, trite and truly dull a motion picture can be. Bad poetry and over-inflated ideas can produce only one thing: poor art.",The Postman

I've seen it at least 5 or 6 times (most recently last night on HBO), and I get totally engrossed in it every time. I want to buy it on video, but I can't find it for sale in any store (and I don't shop on-line).Of course, as a rule, if I read a bad review in the newspaper, I know I'll like the movie - I haven't figured out where these people come from, or if they even saw the same movie I did!

289,stephenpdragoo,Better than I'd hoped,8,31 March 2000,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I saw this.  I had read the original novel a number of times, and I knew from critic reviews that there were some differences between the two.  I hoped, though, that the differences wouldn't be too much.To my delight, although there were significant differences from the original novel, they didn't detract from the original's storyline.  Costner's portrayal of the drifter was perhaps a little wooden in the beginning, but it somehow made it MORE believable:  this wasn't a con artist using a perfected scam to win a few bowls of soup, this was a somewhat decent person who hadn't counted on a simple deception raising so much hope in the hearts of the people.  To see the character grow into his role as the leader of a movement, even down to taking extraordinary risks to protect them from danger, was inspirational and moving.I know the movie didn't receive great reviews when it came out, and neither did Costner's Waterworld.  But, like with Waterworld, I found it very enjoyable, with a good mix of action, character development, suspense, and philosophy.  My only complaint is, why did it receive an R rating?  The movie Titanic showed more nudity than The Postman, and there was little if any gory death scenes.  I would have rated it PG-13 myself.",The Postman

It's an old fashioned movie with old fashioned values, the kind of movie that you expect Jimmy Stewart to star in. It seems it had been decided that Costner was due for a fall, and the critics saw to it that was exactly what happened.
But if you ignore the negative hype you will find a deeply sincere patriotic movie. Not patriotic in the sense of the false history and insulting lies of The Patriot, U-571 or Saving Private Ryan, but instead a realization that a nation is at heart, a community. A view of America based on family, community and communication, perhaps that's why the movie was not accepted - because it presented a nation that frankly does not exist.",The Postman

Just like all of the Kevin Costner sagas this one is great. Robin Hood, Waterworld, Dances with wolves and The Postman are great stories, nice and long where they take the time to build charactors and a plot instead of the typical Hollywood 90 minute instant gratification that a lot of people seem to like. Open Range, another Costner movie is another one of my favorites. A proper western created in the fashion of the old westerns that arent built around just being a shootem up. Much like The Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood. Kevin Costner is hands down one of my favorite actors. Measured and precise with his charactors, IMO, he always fits the part he plays.

Kevin Costner brings a quiet dignity to the role of hero which is a nice change from your typical blast-all-enemies-to-hell hero which is overly prevalent in the movies today. It definitely gives a more interesting view of morality than you are going to get from any Chuck Norris or Arnold Schwarzenegger film. Don't get me wrong, I love a good action film too. I just like to see a thoughtful film every now and again too. The cinematography is beautiful and the story line intelligent. I don't like to give away endings so I will just say that it is satisfying and maintains the dignity of the film. Overall it is well worth the 3 hours.

I loved every 177 minutes of it. It was a film with fine acting and casting, action, an exciting plot, beautifully scened and excellently directed. What I find here though, is a painful paradox, that this movie cannot be so good and yet be about the United States of America. Well, it was good and it was about the U.S.A.",The Postman

302,NewfysMom,"Excellent Movie, ""The Postman""",10,29 March 2005,"While I know many a critic panned this film, I for one, enjoyed every moment of it. For once, Kevin Costner plays humor with a light touch, just under his breath, just out of reach. He becomes a hero who doesn't want to be, all he wants is a warm cup of soup and a soft bed for the night via his buddy the mule Bill, and nothing else. The only one he can't out-think of his feet is Bethlahem, and it is he that he needs to out-think the most. Some I am sure say he used this film to show off his own children, I ignore that because until I read the credits, I didn't KNOW those were his own kids. I give them credit for acting with their father as if he was as all fathers should be... a hero. It would not be the first time a child followed their parent into the world of acting. ""The Postman"" should not be watched lightly, instead, it should be studied intently, as one studies the craters of the moon or patterns on a painting.

307,Gunbert,Great Movie!,10,14 June 2003,"Postman is really a masterpiece of film-history. I can't understand why so much people don't like it, because this movie has nearly everything a good movie needs: good actors (also playing good), a great story and a nearly breathtaking atmosphere. It's of course no movie for people who just want to see a lot of explosions and gunfire (i'm not saying there is no action, this movie has a lot of action). But the real reason why I like this movie so much is, that it has so many ""hidden messages"". I think you only like this movie if you understand this ""hidden messages"". Don't let you foolish by the bad respond it got, because I did in the first place, but this movie showed me that the ""mass"" of people is not always right. I believe there are exactly two kind of people: One half will give this movie a ""0"" because it was too ""boring"" and the other half will give it a ""10"", because they did understand what this movie is really about. But I also have to warn you: don't expect a ""Waterworld 2"", because Postman has less Action and enormous more depth. Just one little thing to the end: remember that 7/10 could mean that 100% of voters did like the movie to 70%, but 5/10 could mean that 50% gave it 0% and 50% gave 100%, so to which of the 50% you will count yourself? :-)",The Postman

310,hamletzzz,Almost Perfect...........,9,3 March 2005,"I just watched this movie even though I have previously read the comments made on it and to tell the truth this movie is simply great. OK, there may be a little bad acting from secondary characters yet it is hidden in the midst of a lot of Good acting and some people may think fifteen year-old letters delivered by this postman cannot be that mighty in doing all this change that the story expresses but I may have a little bit of a difference in opinion cause I believe that hope can be born with the slightest you do to create it as long as the person in who's heart this hope is born is willing to have such hope.Now in a world where everything of value is fading away, people would be willing for the slightest ray of hope, now the fifteen years old letters viewers of the movie criticized as being an overstatement of a power giver is actually considered by myself a great ray of hope.To make this short all I would want to say is, if you wanna watch a great movie called the postman, Then watch one that stars Kevin Costner and Olivia Williams cause if this movie isn't that perfect then at least all I know is it sends the viewer two important messages which are it is never too late to change everything that is wrong around him and it is a human's belief that he is weaker than another is what makes him actually weak........

I totally loved the post-apocalyptic scenario pictured, how people try to reorganize themselves in small cities etc. However, 10 years later I still adore the basic story, of the postman building a new kind of network in this desert-like rotten place one called USA. I still feel so cozy when I see Costner inside this old car in mitten of the woods and its raining outside. But it is a pity how badly and superficial the dialogues and the characters are. The ""good guy""/ ""bad guy"" roles are so very bold it gets simply ridiculous. I also think the love story is not accurate for such a dramatic film.Further Ed Wood completely fails in building a post-war atmosphere. Despite the fact that everything was destroyed during war and following weather-changes I felt more in a medieval movie or a western than in 2013. References to post-modern life are totally missing.

I think it tries to be as accurate in it's portrayal of the future as any movie I've ever seen.  I know that some of you just can't stand the fact that there's no futuristic army battles, no 600 horsepower car chases, and ""Iron armored costumes"" I honestly think that's how the world would go if all government and basic infrastructure were brought down.   Think about it. What would you do?  Drive a 600 horsepower, supercharged dune buggy that gets 3 mpg or ride a horse.  Gasoline supplies would deplete after about a month.  Hoarding gas will not work.  (it goes bad after about a year of storage) Most people raised in big cities would starve within a couple of months due to lack of survival education or tyrany by people with guns.Secondly,  In the film, Costner ends up being the hero in the way that real hero's do.  Hero's aren't the people who are tough and beautiful. They're people who are forced into a situation and do the best they can. He starts the new government purely by accident. The only real mistake I see in this movie is that in the beginning, Costner is portrayed as being weak and unable to defend himself.  In reality he would be in extremely good shape strong as an ox and very wilely.  (he's been dragging a mule around for years. Try that sometime. It'll make you strong as an ox or kill you) I give it 9 out of 10",The Postman

Complaining that there isn't enough action? Since when do movies require action to be enjoyable? If you were looking for action, you missed the point entirely. This film requires you to THINK, which I realize is difficult for some.People scoff at the idea that a postman could be important. We have so many lines of communication open to us today that it's difficult for people to even consider the idea that we could be closed off from the rest of the world. Ask settlers of the old west how important the mail is. What about the armed forces? You don't think they get excited at the prospect of receiving mail, especially if they are stationed in a distant country? Try looking at these peoples point of view. They leave they safety of their town, they don't come back. There is a tyrannical organization that makes frequent raids on their town. Many of these people haven't heard from loved ones in YEARS. I for one would think that if the opportunity to correspond with my family presented itself, I'd be pretty damn excited as well.

The billing to compare this to quality and wonder of Dancing with Wolves was a sham and misleading. If I did not know any better, you might think this was a Mormon plot of sorts, with the polygamy and weirdness of it taking place right in Mormon Country, Idaho and Utah. Using Old Testament and Mormon reasons for the sharing of women and it's polygamist innuendos were more than alarming. The injecting of African decent actors was more than a patronization of the story line. Worse, using the United States preambles all within this maze of the true religion as subliminal as it pretended and it's people was awful. One wonders what was going on in the minds at WB to produce such a worthless piece of entertainment (entertainment - it is was not). The story and events are corny and can only be described as more of an introduction into the cult like culture of the current day territory and region.

Of course, I did not think that Waterworld was as terrible as the reviews, I saw it twice on the big screen and recorded it on DVR. and I actually saw Message in a Bottle and liked it--although not as much as my fiancée!

I explain: it was long, but in the bad way. films can be long but if they are good, you don't know, you only sit and spend addicted to the screen. Gone with the wind is long. But there are enough thing that make you short. The Postman, not. It was bored and bizarre. I mean, it looked as if all the atrezzo was a big joke. But it wasn't. They pretended that we took seriously this film. But watching long haired Costner as the new Mesias wasn't exactly what I call believable. Anyway, I admit I'm not being parcial. I don't like war movies, don't like SF and don't like westerns, and The Postman was a mix of those. But trust me -if it were well done, maybe I would have liked themix. But I couldn't. No script, no good acting, not a beautiful film, no good or interesting action. It looked a film of the 80s. In conclusion, I can say I didn't like at all and I hope nobody watches it (it's just because I want the better for everybody). the best of the movie: I rented it, so I didn't lose much money. the worst of the movie: It exists.sorry for my english, i'm spanish!!!",The Postman

The apocalyptic story of a bad actor turned postman is so silly, so pretentious and at times so bad it made me gargle with scope during commercial breaks. If anyone wishes to waste three hours of their life (I wasted three the first viewing and then one and a half more eleven years later) I would recommend thinking of this doo doo as a comedy and try not to think how much better $ 80,000,000 dollars could have been spent on breaking the Guinness record for the biggest bowl of kraft macaroni and cheese.It is disturbing to think that KevinCostner who made such a classy, wonderful film as Dances with Wolves, from time to time forgets to flush.",The Postman
323,gvogel-1,Highly Underrated,10,21 March 2004,"When checking out ""The Postman"", I had some reservations since it did poorly in theaters and with reviewers. Well, I was blown away at how great this film was.Note that the movie differs GREATLY from the book, but not in a poor way as is the norm in Hollywood. I like both! Heck, I may even like the movie a little more.Look, I don't care much for Costner, but he does a fine job in the film. There are plenty of others who help make this movie enjoyable, and that helps a lot.I find that people who see this movie either hate it or love it - there doesn't seem to be much in-between. If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, check this one out. It's a little more ""positive"" than your usual post-apocalyptic stories, so if you want doom and gloom you may be disappointed.Another warning is that this is more of a ""story"" movie - not a ""shock and awe"" type of movie. It's a little long, but worth it for the story.",The Postman
324,kjempeintens,Worst movie ever,1,26 July 2004,"I'm sorry folks, but this movie is bound to be 3 hours wasted if you're planning to see it. The storyline is horrid; the movie is very, very long (I had to take breaks!) and the acting is at best mediocre.The story has Kevin Costner as the heroic postman, saving the day when restoring the postal system. I'm sure postal workers like it though, as it gives their job a very flattering impression of being important. But if you're not a postal worker - stay away!Frankly I'm tempted to purchase a copy and destroy, only to feel better about it.Burn, burn, burn!",The Postman
325,vytautas-kiausas,Lithuanian documentary,10,24 March 2018,"This movie is like watching history long past as Lithuanian. When my country was divided between Prussia, Austro-Hungarian, Russian Empires they banned Lithuanian language and literature, they wanted to wipe us out of existance. Then men called Knygneshiai - book bearers appeared. They brought books and letters from Prussia which even though had our land didn't want us gone. These were brave men who risked their lives, many did, to protect and preserve our fathers and mothers memories alive. I give this movie a solid 10, because this reality is more real then people might think.",The Postman
326,BlankTV,The movie misses the entire point of the book.,5,5 September 2017,"The reason I loathe this movie is it doesn't do any justice to David Brin's stunning novel and the concepts within.The movie takes the most simple plot lines from the book: freedom vs. tyranny and a a loose love story, while ignoring the major points of what constitutes a society, how we choose lies to define us (for better or worse), technology vs. morality, augments vs. neo-hippies, tech- worship, etc.It's embarrassing considering the wealth of riches they had to draw from in the novel.",The Postman

328,eschandler,Worth Watching,9,17 October 2004,"Although flawed, The Postman is definitely intriguing. The cinematography is flawless and makes me want to move to Oregon (if that is where they really shot it). Kevin Costner does what he does best and that is playing characters that are put in unfortunate circumstances and miraculously he saves the day.Some scenes could have been cut which would have given the movie a better pace. The scene when they travel up the mountain and eat the horse was a little hokey. Overall, The Postman is a movie I will watch multiple times.",The Postman

331,cmdrmom2,Brilliant Movie,10,2 June 2005,"The photography, lighting, portraying of human emotion was incredible. The scenario is entirely possible given the condition of the world today, and the hatred of so many people against their fellow humanity. Moments of darkness are uplifted by the exuberance of youth and the portrayal of hope when there is nothing left to lose. When I started watching, and realized the length of the movie, I was prepared to be disappointed and maybe a bit bored, but that never happened. Costner came through again with another great movie, making this film the ""Dances With Wolves"" of science fiction films. Great special effects and cinematography.",The Postman
332,gedatkin,"Think for yourselves, don't listen to critics",8,8 March 2020,"I watched this film, having seen it voted one of the worst movies of all time. Fortunately, I'm capable of individual thought. I thought I was in for a risible script, appalling acting and a boring experience. Instead, I was engrossed. Yes, it's long and yes, it was a familiar formula. Nonetheless, I thought the idea of a reluctant hero not realising his serendipitous disguise would be the beginning of a revolution, was a depature from the norm. Well done Kevin, you should be proud.",The Postman

How important is fame? Food or music or protection or one for the other? There will always be horrid little mule eating monsters in the world and we could see them better if society would pay attention.It seems the big country we live in gets much smaller in times of crisis. In the event of The End Times the strong will survive and the smart and aware will run them/ Weather its bombs ,likley, religious ,really possible, or one of the thousand other ways the human will think up to end ourselves we all need The Heros.

I haven't posted any review prior to this but when i saw the overall rating of this movie on IMDb, couldn't help adding my own few lines. The message this movie wanted to put across, is portrayed so beautifully, without involving too many emotions.I couldn't leave the movie in between as I found it quite captivating. Though the era shown seems little too fictitious but the storyline, acting , cinematography , direction everything is just so wonderful. Till date, can't really imagine how one can beautifully direct a movie and at the same time act so well in it. And I really believe, One man can actually change the world.",The Postman
335,chrismstm,What a great film,7,7 May 2005,"I think the reason this movie gets poor reviews is because people walk into the theater with the wrong expectations. Costner is not the typical hero. He starts out as a lazy con man that is difficult to respect. However, his con creates a movement of many people who believe in America and the freedom it once stood for. Costner is a useless, lazy coward, a terrible con-man and a former actor who is upstaged by a former copier salesman. Suddenly, he finds his ""call to duty"" inescapable and leads a fight for a freer America. Drawing his strength and courage from the people who follow him, he discovers that freedom and liberty are definitely worth fighting for. The idea of a post apocalyptic world is nothing new, but the way America returns to the ideals of its fore fathers is brilliant.",The Postman

But I can't for the life of me figure what possessed him to get involved with this very very long, wooden, unbelievable piece of drivel! Did he owe someone money or something? I suppose the movie's saving grace is that it's fairly harmless and may be useful therapy for people who have sleep disorders! However, it possibly does great disservice to the efforts of postal workers or ordinary citizens by implying that they may not be that honest. Kevin does after all impersonate a postal worker-a federal offense! Technicalities aside, rather than watching this one, you'd be better off mowing the lawn or having an early night!",The Postman
338,noldor22,not as bad as people say,9,11 June 2005,people need to take this movie for what it is. its yet another post apocalypse movie but not half as bad as some of the others out there. people wanna get into things like how did they conquer the United States on horseback well its post apocalypse there are no vehicles so they use horses and also they conquered with brute force as there was no army to fight back. when someone finally did fight back they overcame them. i took this movie for what it was. had some good up and coming actors and also some established acting veterans. kevin costner does an OK job as the reluctant hero and it was a nice change to see a hero just trying to exist instead of being the token badass you get in so many other films of this type. all in all worth a view.,The Postman
339,karen-clough,I like this movie,10,16 June 2005,I have seen The Postman many times.I always enjoy it. The courage of the characters and the performances of the actors is excellent.The interaction between the cast members is great.The scenery is wonderful.The story line is easy to follow and very enjoyable.There is just enough humor to make the overall story light hearted in spite of the severity of the times it is set in.I would recommend this movie to anyone at anytime.The interaction between Kevin Costner and Olivia Williams is very believable.I like the inclusion of Tom Petty and Peggy Lipton in the cast.Naming Richard Starky as the President is great.,The Postman

The Postman was a great insight to the many faces of Americans. The character examinations and exposures are excellent. Kevin plays his character in a very believable way, communicating his uncertainty of the character his character has chosen to play. The character development is thorough, and is very convincing as to what America would be if the setup scenario were true. Kudos to Kevin, and the rest of the cast for their fun and exciting insight to these people. I recommend you buy this video, and share it with your children.",The Postman

342,lovely_hubby,Plainly awful,1,30 July 2015,"When everyone thought Kevin Costner have learned from the Waterworld  disaster, he stroke back with this. Just wishful thinking. The postman  is simply Waterworld on the ground. A post apocalyptic world with some  bad guys that have as their leader a very very bad guy. The best way  they have to have fun is harass people around. Have seen that before?  Yes, you have. Since Mad Max script writers have been insisting on the  idea, translating it to different environments as if that was a way to  make something new and creative. And, heavens! I really can't  understand the true obsession American script writers have with the  ""Militia"" thing. Must perhaps be due to the fact that in USA the gun  rules since the old west times and their psychology can't get rid from  that fetish.",The Postman
343,tiankem,Top 5 Post-Apocalyptic movies ever made!,10,7 September 2015,"**Spoiler alert (barely)** What the hell were the critics smoking with the terrible reviews about this movie! This movie was made in 1997 yet the undeserved criticism still unnerves me. The Postman is arguably the best post-apocalyptic movie ever made! I love the way that this movie keeps a post-world-war setting realistic, small and with communal ties. It correctly portrays a realistic lack of communication due to an unnamed catastrophe (probably an EMP and/or Nuke). The story is especially interesting because of the way the Postman literally stumbles into his role due to a desire to survive but then passionately becomes the lie he is portraying only after a woman kicks his butt into gear (isn't that what usually happens in life?). Kevin Costner does an outstanding job, as does Olivia Williams and especially Will Patton. Got to love the cameo by Tom Petty! I read Brin's book and it starts out very well but then moves from a realistic and thrilling post-apocalyptic survival story to a wasteland of fantastic tech story tangents. The movie on the other hand is adapted very well for the big screen and keeps the plot on task, despite the 3 hour time frame (I had no problem with this in this movie). Strange how the book was award-winning yet the movie got so much criticism; that's backwards if you ask me. This movie is about HOPE. Those critics that thought certain scenes were ""cheesy"" or that ""it was the worst movie of the year"" are the same critics that continually keep the minions on track toward the brainless, plot less movies that have a serious lack of character development...but hey, they have GREAT special effects and action! They are the same critics that laugh at the very notion of HOPE in movies. HOPE is something our world needs more of and it was the powerful and critical ingredient that sparked a revolution in The Postman. I loved this movie! I rarely watch movies more than once or twice yet I own this movie and have watched it countless times. I am a huge fan of the post-apocalyptic genre and this movie is easily in my top 5 of that genre! I find it interesting that over 52,000 ""non-critics"" have voted about this movie on this website, and the highest number of votes came in at 7 out of 10 (10,630 votes); hardly ""the worst movie of the year"". Thank you Kevin for choosing to make The Postman over other choices you had at the time. Those of us ""non-critics"" appreciate it!",The Postman
344,lestat-52,Worst movie ever,1,3 August 2005,"When watching the postman my mood changed from at first outrage: ""How could anyone make such complete nonsense"" to laughter in the end when it became apparent that some stupid Americans would watch this and think what a great country USA is.Costner started out directing with style in Dances with wolves, scraped the bottom with the expensive waterworld and then wrote himself into history with the Postman. I've really tried to find a worse movie but i have failed - this is the lowest, crappiest, longest piece of pro-American bullshit that was ever created.Hopefully it will stay that way....",The Postman

However, you have to see beyond the stars and bars of the flag the Postman fights for, and think about what it might mean in a world filled with chaos and despair, otherwise it might feel a bit tacky.The idea that the young people of the destroyed earth longs for something bigger and ""decent"" is terrific. I could see myself as a post-carrier in the sinister future that might be waiting for us.There is no people in ice-hockey armour, no bad-ass cars and no mohawk hair, but i didn't even miss it once during the whole movie (almost 3 hours). Instead Costner has created a sort of wild west world that is fresh and interesting to watch.So if you like PA movies, don't miss this one!Ps.

I took notes through the entire movie, and as I look back on them now I can see different parts of the movie through my handwriting. The climax is definite as my letters became larger and the words were underlined. I stayed with this movie until the end.

I don't think I totally disliked any, not even Waterworld and I have no idea why all the negative hype.One thing Kevin Costner offers in all his movies is, incredible talent. He never gives us anything less than his best and tends to bring out the very best in those fortunate enough to work with him. Obviously I am a huge fan and have been for many years, but Dragonfly was the final straw for me. He held me spellbound in this movie, several times and if you really pay close attention, you will see natural talent in every performance with no faking it and no over acting. Kevin makes a difficult profession look effortless. That takes nothing less than pure talent.Most important to me, I think, is the genuine goodness within the man that comes through.Happy Birthday Shumani tutanka o wachi (Dances With Wolves)Health and love always, Sandy",The Postman

The plot is absurd, in places the film is just plain annoying. That scene where he collects the letter from the boy for example. Why gallop the poor nag in the wrong direction if only to pull on the heart strings with some over the top music and slow motion photography.
