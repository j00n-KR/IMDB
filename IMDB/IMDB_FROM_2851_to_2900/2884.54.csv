0,bkoganbing,Playground of the elite,7,5 February 2014,"Once upon a time in the not too distant past a man named Steve Rubell who to look at in this film and in real life was not all that much decided to create a playground where only the elite could participate. Two criteria decided who was among the elite, power and beauty. Rubell courted the powerful and selected only the beautiful. He created Studio 54 on West 54 Street in Manhattan and people would beg to be admitted. I was actually in the place once, not on charm, beauty, or personality mind you, but for a political fundraiser when it was rented out.One who got in on sheer beauty in this film was New Jersey kid Ryan Phillippe and it is through his eyes that the story of 54 unfolds. And we see Mike Myers as Steve Rubell who reveled in the company of the powerful and beautiful, indulged in all the vices, and stole from his own business like the wise guys in Goodfellas used to rob the cargo shipments at JFK Airport like it was an ATM. Missing from the story is his partner Ian Schrager, still very much with us, still very much a power player. It's for that reason he is missing, but it renders 54 inaccurate from the start.Phillippe has no problem using his looks and body to get all the sex he wants and to advance himself and establish. It's the main lesson he learns from Myers. What he sees as an ultimate goal in life, is something in the end he rejects.Myers is fascinating and repellent at the same time. You've got to wonder why people would curry favors from this man, but in point of fact it happened. You know where he's headed and 54 makes you want to see him fall, at the same time you wish you could be part of the 54 scene.Selma Hayek and Breckin Mayer play a couple who work at 54, a married couple who take Phillippe in. The hedonist atmosphere puts a strain on their marriage like few others are tested. Also Neve Campbell, a soap actress who is from New Jersey like Phillippe is also an ambitious woman who teaches Phillippe a thing or two. They all register well.In the end though 54 is in the joint custody of both Ryan Phillippe and Mike Myers. This was Phillippe's breakthrough part and Myers is not in this role a part of Wayne's World or Austin Powers. No this is the story of a self indulgent man who had a heady ride and a tremendous fall.",54
1,SnoopyStyle,So many problems,2,24 February 2014,"Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe) is an innocent Jersey kid who is star-struck by the bright lights of Manhattan and wishes to meet stars like Julie Black (Neve Campbell) in Studio 54. Club owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) lets Shane in and ends up hiring the pretty kid as a bus boy. He befriends fellow employees Anita Randazzo (Salma Hayek) and Greg Randazzo (Breckin Meyer) who are trying to launch Anita's singing career. Meanwhile Rubell rules the club like a modern Caligula dealing drugs and getting the attention of the IRS.This is a cliché filled glossy superficial movie. It starts with the naive innocent that we're suppose to see this movie through. Shane is way too stupid, and his sycophant voice overs don't make it any better. Then there is Mike Myers. I do not begrudge anybody for taking a risk. However he is so out of his depths. In a better actor's hands, this could have been an amazing character. His amoral sleaziness could be a movie all by itself. Instead this is strictly a cliché factory. It annoyed me to no ends.",54
2,mark.waltz,Divine decadence doesn't cast stones...once you're inside.,3,8 November 2016,"This is ""Goodfellas"" meets ""Valley of the Dolls"", a deliciously trashy example of the dark side of night life that is legendary even today. Oh, the many ghosts I've felt walking through the doors of the former disco, now a legitimate Broadway theater that transitioned from nightclub to stage with the classic German expression of decadence, ""Cabaret"". Nightclubs still have a strict door policy like this, but 54 made it famous, even if it wasn't the first. This thrives on the disco beat of the late '70s/early '80s, tossing in obvious corruption from behind the scenes from a manager who was ingenious in many ways but idiotic and careless in a ton of others. ""I've been to a marvelous party"", Noel Coward wrote, but as his muse, Elaine Stritch, admitted, some of those marvelous parties really weren't so marvelous.It's a fantasy land that makes reality tedious, and for bar-back turned successful bartender Ryan Phillipe, that marvelous party turns out to be the key to the door to his possible destruction, turning him from a basically decent kid from Jersey City to an absolute phony. As for Michael Meyers' Steve Rubell, well, I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but he was as sleazy as they come, never realizing the self destruction his doomed success has him headed towards.I have to call this a guilty pleasure, a fun bad movie, and a reminder of my own party days which in many respects, as a whole, were not really marvelous. Ellen Albertini Dow, one of the cutest of little old ladies, is unforgettably lovable as Disco Dotty, a fictionalized version of a real character, and all she's missing is the cat and the birdcage to be a dancin' granny with a Tweety bird. The narration by Philippe gives this a pedestrian feel, with a feeling of nostalgia that lasts as long as the club stays open, but the feeling of sleaze has the same impact as a Sunday morning hangover. I may not be able to read minds, but I do know the difference between classic art and a framed poster that ends up in the trash after its owner realizes its true value. But for those of us who were there for lights and beat, this is a nice memory that soon is as forgotten as one of those cheap book store posters.",54
3,lee_eisenberg,And did what corporations always do...,10,7 March 2006,"When ""54"" got released, many critics claimed that it was just another attempt to get into the '70s nostalgia that had swept the country. It's more than that. The movie shows New York's Studio 54, an unusual club where young people danced to disco and could meet celebrities, as seen through the eyes of employee Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe). At the end, he talks about, how after the government closed the place down, a corporation took it over and did what corporations always do: make the place safe and sterile. Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) built it up into a most unique hangout, and the corporation drained the life out of it.So don't trust the critics. This was a really good movie.",54
4,moonspinner55,"Superficial and awkward, but with a pleasurable, hedonistic nostalgia...",5,12 February 2012,"Writer-director Mark Christopher worked hard at recreating the sinfully decadent magic of Manhattan's Studio 54, the number-one celebrity hangout from the late-1970s into the 1980s, but he skimped on the most intriguing part of the nightclub's history: the relationship between business partners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager. Mike Myers was a terrific choice for the flamboyant, eccentric Rubell, but Schrager has gone missing. Instead, the story is told from the point-of-view of a busboy-turned-bartender (!), a muscular rube whose innocence is soiled by boss Rubell's dirty business dealings and hedonistic trappings. The film has a low-budget feel which doesn't make itself present in the production so much as in the character-driven scenes, which are underpopulated, padded with real and faked black-and-photos, and further undermined by stilted dialogue. Ryan Phillipe is well-cast as the young stud from New Jersey whom Rubell takes under his wing, yet his voice-over narration is uncomfortably omnipresent, telling us things we can see or perceive for ourselves, and the interrelationships between the club staff are uninteresting. Some of the music is good, bringing back those long-ago nights of carefree sex and dancing-the-night-away, but Christopher doesn't grasp the big picture. As a result, the film (at best) is a series of precious little moments struggling to surface. ** from ****",54
5,Quinoa1984,Trashy Drama,7,30 March 2000,"54 is an Ok film cause it mixes Melrose Place with Mike Myers' character style.  The film showcases a twisted around version of the true story of the corruption of the studio 54 during the late 70's.  The performances are good, the script is OK, the style is great, but there is something missing here.  Maybe It's co-owner Ian Schrager (left out of the movie, though a co-owner of 54) who wasn't around to tell Myers to lay off his Jewish accent.  B+",54
6,wes-connors,"This Ain't No Party, This Ain't No Disco, This Ain't No Fooling Around",5,18 January 2010,"Beautiful teenager Ryan Phillippe (as Shane O'Shea) is tired of cruising New Jersey with his plain boyfriends, and aches to go to Manhattan's famous ""Studio 54"" disco. There, he hopes to meet his idol, soap opera star Neve Campbell (as Julie Black). Taking off his shirt for ""54"" manager Mike Myers (as Steve Rubell) helps Mr. Phillippe gain admittance to the club. Working in his gym shorts gets Phillippe invited to hobnob with celebrities like Princess Grace and Andy Warhol. Eventually, Phillippe gains celebrity status. He models for magazines and gets ""the clap"". Will the world of sex, drugs, and disco get Phillippe down? Probably, you won't care, because there is so little depth to this film. Phillippe is very attractive, but the character is limp. Ms. Campbell is seen little, and adds the same. The second tier coupling of busboy Breckin Meyer (as Greg) and singer Salma Hayek (as Anita) adds some sexual energy. Mr. Myers is wasted. You may get a kick out of drug-snorting grandma Ellen Albertini Dow (as ""Dottie"" aka ""Mona""). And, Heather Matarazzo (as Grace) does well as Phillippe's sister. Reportedly censored, Mark Christopher's ""54"" holds back far too much. It's almost impossible to believe anything this bland could have been so popular.***** 54 (8/28/98) Mark Christopher ~ Ryan Phillippe, Mike Myers, Salma Hayek, Breckin Meyer",54
7,preppy-3,Pretty pathetic,1,25 November 2003,"Dull, boring story about the legendary Studio 54 and one of its owners, Steve Rubell (played by Mike Meyers).  It also deals with three other people played by Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer.  What their names were, I don't remember...mostly because there's absolutely nothing going on here.Purportedly, the original version was much stronger--so strong with sex and drug use that it was threatened with an NC-17.  Then test audiences reacted VERY negatively to the extreme stuff (a gay kiss was completely cut out). What came out was a seriously watered down version of what might have been a good movie.  I HATE those stupid test audiences!!  I was actually in Studio 54 back in 1980--what I saw there was in NO way portrayed in the movie.  The drug use was out in the open and there were people (literally) having sex--gay and straight!  That's not shown here in any way.Phillippe (as the lead) was terrible.  He is handsome and muscular but has a blank face on all the time.  Hayek is good but given nothing to do.  Ditto with Meyer (who's VERY good).  Neve Campbell barely even registered.  Myers is (surprisingly) very good in a dramatic role.  The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for him.  Also there are a few good songs (especially ""If You Could Read My Mind"").But, basically, this movie is so light and inconseqential that I forgot about it the next day!  A waste.  See the E True Hollywood Story on this--that gives a much more accurate portrayal of the club itself.",54
8,Uriah43,The Age of Disco,6,16 October 2018,"""Shane O'Shea"" (Ryan Phillippe) is a 19-year old man who lives in Jersey City and wants to experience the life of glamour on the other side of the Hudson River. So one night he goes to Manhattan and joins the huge crowd of people seeking entrance into the world-famous nightclub known as Studio 54. Although most are turned away, the club owner ""Steve Rubell"" (Mike Myers) surprisingly allows Shane to come in and not long afterward hires him to be a busser. It's at this time that Shane meets ""Greg Randazzo"" (Breckin Meyer) and his wife ""Anita"" (Salma Hayek) who invite him to live with them for a while. He quickly accepts and before long gets caught up in the wild New York City nightlife which Studio 54 epitomized. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film served as an interesting snapshot of a time and place when disco ruled the airwaves. That said, while I enjoyed the trip down memory lane and thought that Mike Myers performed in an exceptional manner, I also thought that there wasn't sufficient character development in some places which subsequently caused the film to seem somewhat shallow and uneven at times. Be that as it may, I liked this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",54
9,anaconda-40658,54 Reasons to See It.,9,11 September 2015,"54 (1998): Dir: Mark Christopher / Cast: Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Breckin Meyer: Dazzling film remembering Club 54 as the place to be. Set in 1979 with Ryan Phillippe venturing to Club 54 upon seeing a photo of soap star Neve Campbell in a newspaper. Club owner Mike Myers hires him as a bartender. The club demands a distinct appearance and upon removing his shirt, Phillippe is granted entry while his friends remain outside. Other key roles belong to Selma Hayek as a dancer whose bus boy husband steals money from the club. Campbell surfaces as a woman who hates her job and uses the club to escape the spotlight but her footage is almost unnecessary since it more or less disjoints the screenplay. Director Mark Christopher films it as an event with spectacular art direction. Mike Myers delivers the film's best performance as the corrupt club owner trying to avoid the I.R.S. He has both charm as well a loathing appeal where he can use employees at any means. Breckin Meyer plays Hayek's husband who is the real culprit when dirty deeds are passed. In the end it will all catch up with him as his empire crumbles. During the final credits we are given a glimpse of real celebrities that appeared in the club and represented its happening. It is a film about time and what occurs within it or how it stood still during club hours. Score: 9 / 10",54
10,Sylviastel,"Sex, Drugs, & Disco",7,14 August 2015,"Ryan Philippe plays Shane from Jersey City, New Jersey. He tells the story of his life at 54 during the last days of the era. Mike Myers is fine as Steve Rubell. There are plenty of familiar faces here. Perhaps, I'm disappointed that Sherry Stringfield was barely used in the film. I enjoyed seeing the twin towers in New York City. I definitely understood where Shane was coming from in actuality. New York City always looks better from the New Jersey side. I grew up in New Jersey where you aspire to be there. New York City in the seventies and eighties were exciting, fun, and gritty. I wouldn't have mind living then there. it's not the same New York City anymore. Club 54 was the ultimate place to be in the city. this film does a fine story in telling the story of 54 in the final months. Every party ends somehow and it did for Steve Rubell.",54
11,StevePulaski,Nothing but wanna-be party monsters,6,4 June 2013,"Studio 54 was one of the defining clubs of the seventies. Known for its lavish parties, limitless energy, and the known hangout for A-list celebrities, its inviting, yet elusive atmosphere completely challenged the party-life at that point in time. It was a cultural staple that has now faded into a curious piece of history.It's only logical that a film make an attempt to capture the energy and the enigma of the popular nightclub, and Mark Christopher's 54 does just that at a basic level. Enthusiasts of the nightclub will find the atmosphere of the film adoring and majestic, while detractors or outsides will find little to note here. This is more a Cliff Notes representation of an enormous cultural staple. Think the social change the Vietnam War provided being summed up in a pamphlet of information.The film stars Ryan Phillippe as Shane O'Shea, a young Jersey boy who lives a pretty unremarkable life until he ups the courage to cross the New York/Jersey border and becomes a bartender at Studio 54. Not long after, he meets the aspiring singer Anita (Salma Hayek) and her overprotective husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer) and gradually becomes closer and closer with Anita and alienating Greg in the meantime. Shane also finds himself slightly at odds with the egomaniac club-owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), who consistently reminds him he is an easily-replaceable pretty face. Overtime, Shane becomes sucked into the twisted drug culture that Studio 54 bears, along with the heavily dramatic lifestyle, which will ultimately cause his demise and the club's.One would anticipate a film like 54 be able to capture the strange, uncouth wackiness of the club along with being able to bring the raw focus had by a film like Boogie Nights and the sophistication of a film like Casino. Unfortunately, we don't get much of either. 54 is a fine examination of a club, but it's too unwilling to go beneath the surface and really expose anything. It plays safe, hitting the right notes at the right time. Never does it become inoffensive or shifts its tone into a rawer, more unadulterated look.Both of the aforementioned films had the luxury of surprising their audiences whether it was in the way of style or in the way of content. 54 remains something of an effigy in terms of style; it features rather muted colors and not a lot of dance floor excitement as the club was known for. We get a more behind the scenes look, which is nice, but rarely do we dive much into the characters to a get a sense of what they're truly about. We know a bit more about the characters than the average caricatures that pass in a raunchy teen flick but not by a whole lot.Returning to the point of the style of the particular film, it's all pretty bland and inert. The excitement and energy that existed in the club isn't translated well enough to film. If 54 wanted to take on a persona equivalent to that of, say, European art-house, what could've unfolded would've been sure beauty in the way of color and vibe. It settles for a mediocre palette of redundant colors - that is when the film chooses to show them off.At least we have a slew of solid performances here; Ryan Phillippe is strong as the lead character, portraying his rise believably and his downfall professionally, Salma Hayek is interesting to watch as always, Breckin Meyer gets a few laughs, and Mike Myers gives the best or his worst performance of his career depending on how you look at it. While no performance is necessarily bad, they all occupy an uncertain state in the sense that nobody knows if they're supposed to be serious or satirical. Myers' character seems to be from a different film, playing Rubell with a looser persona rather than Phillippe, who seems to be playing Shane with complete seriousness.54 is benefited by a strong cast and favorable writing from director Christopher, but it's relatively too safe and too restricted to truly call itself the encompassing film on an entire culture.Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer, Mike Myers, and Sela Ward. Directed by: Mark Christopher.",54
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,The rise and fall of Studio 54,7,5 February 2005,"Unfortunately, ""54"" could've been more effective. It's a good movie, but it didn't have any depth. I've always been interested in history, and lately I've been studying the 60's and 70's decades. They are actually very interesting. I have a bit of an interest in Studio 54. I knew there was a movie about it, so I rented, and it didn't really effect me like it should have. I think that's why the rating isn't that good. If you watch ""Casino"", you have the full effect of the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas. Scorcesse understood that, and Mark Christopher didn't seem to have a good grip on it. It was a well made film and the acting was fine. But, it could have been more effective. That's all I'm saying.7/10",54
13,MovieAddict2016,Could have been much better,4,16 December 2005,"""54"" is a film based on the infamous ""Studio 54"" of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982.The film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like ""Boogie Nights"" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe. Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell. It's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure.""54"" could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging. View at your own peril.",54
14,paul2001sw-1,Not freedom,3,5 February 2005,"Elite nightclubs are all about hedonism and the power of the young, rich, and beautiful; places where a rigid hierarchy holds sway, albeit an alternative one. One may understand why those in the in-crowd may enjoy such places; but to suggest that they symbolise ""freedom"" is a rather strange interpretation. But every Hollywood film has to pay homage to this virtue, however still defined, and so '54', Mark Christopher's film about a once-fashionable New York venue, tries to suggest there was something idealistic about the place, in spite of the fact there seem few ideals on view. To strengthen this rather weak idea, his script casts lead actor Ryan Phillipe as a young Adonis, who is far too sweet to serve as a useful vehicle into the dark side of this underworld; but he tells us there was something mystical about the place, and as the audience, we're expected to believe him, although all we see are a lot of dancing, drug-taking, and sex. Which might not be unbelievable, but is hardly unique. Meanwhile, the film's plot goes nowhere and even seems to bottle out of it's own natural climax. The real Studio 54 might indeed have been where it was all happening; but this gentle homage is really very bland.",54
15,MOscarbradley,Entertaining enough but better to stick with the cd.,6,5 May 2017,"A look down the cast list of Mark Christopher's ""54"" might provide a few surprises. Yes, before he decided he wanted to be the King of the World Donald Trump turned up as a patron as did Michael York, Sheryl Crow, Cindy Crawford, Heidi Klum, Art Garfunkel and Peter Bogdanovitch but I wouldn't waste my time trying to pick them out of the darkness. The film is a 'biography' of New York's famous Studio 54 as seen through the eyes of hot young busboy Ryan Phillippe, (he spends most of the film with his shirt off). Michael Myers is Steve Rubell, the club's manager and the cast also includes Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse's"" Dawn Wiener herself, Heather Matarazzo. It's not much of a movie; it's mostly like a sex obsessed music video but the music's great which makes up for a lot and it does capture the hedonistic, drug-fuelled atmosphere of the place while Myers is surprisingly good, Still, maybe you would be better off buying the double cd instead.",54
16,dromasca,Good Club Movie,7,22 February 2003,"54 is above the avearge with its recreation of the late 70s club scene in New York. The story of a New Jersey guy dreaming of the big city, and making it to the center of the sparkling night life is quite well done, with a good recreation of the athmosphere and some truth in the psychology of the characters. Acting is fair to good, music is fun, and there is less melodrama than in similar epoch stories. 7/10 on my personal scale.",54
17,The-Sarkologist,Another One of those Films,4,20 July 2019,"This is another one of those films that I am not really all that sure why I wanted to watch it. I guess in part I wanted to watch a film about hedonism in the late 70s, particularly during the disco era, mostly because I've sort of experience the rave era of the beginning of the 20th century, and in part wanted to get a taste of it. Maybe in another sense I really wanted something a little more retro in feel, though of course this film was released in 1998, so it is definitely not retro in that regards.The film is basically about this rather infamous nightclub in New York called Studio 54. Basically, it was the place that pretty much everybody wanted to get into, but unless you were really famous, had oodles of money, or the owner, Steve Rubell, thought that you were drop dead gorgeous, and wanted you to be a part of his club. Well, that is basically what happened with this guy from Jersey city - Shane.He was young, and Jersey city really isn't a place that is renowned for its nightlife, particularly since you happen to have New York just across the river. As such, one night they decide to ditch this town and decide to go and check out the big city. Well, while standing out the front, amongst the crowds trying to get into Studio 54, he is noticed by Steve and called over. Mind you, he wants him to enter, as long as he removes his shirt, so he does so, and thus his life changes.Well, it changes in the sense that he comes back and manages to score himself a job there. He starts off as a bus boy, that is he collects bottles, and eventually makes his way up to the position of bartender. Apparently if you work in this club thenn, well, you do actually get paid a pretty decent amount of money, and that is on top of the tips, and all of the goodies that the drugged out patrons tend to leave behind. Oh, and this isn't just a job, it is actually one long big party.Yeah, this is a film about hedonism, and in many cases we know where it is heading. Sure, not all films about hedonism have bad endings, but we do tend to know what eventually came from the club, namely that the IRS shut it down. Apparently the version I watched ended with Shane and his friends making up after Rubell was arrested, but I get the feeling that there are versions of this film that have much more happening at the end, namely that once Rubell is taken out of the picture, and Studio 54 shut down, then a number of other clubs start up on a similar theme, which means that once Rubell is released from gaol, he finds that he can no longer compete.Look, it turned out that this film was, well, pretty bad. It is pretty much similar to a lot of other hedonistic movies out there, namely about a guy that pretty much makes it big because of his looks, and then it all crashes down around him. Mind you, it didn't really do all that well at the cinemas, but that was probably because it was heavily cut. However, it has since been making a resurgance, especially since the footage has been moved about a bit. Still, it really wasn't one of those films that particularly impressed me all that much.",54
18,elshikh4,Anti and Pro ??!!,1,7 December 2009,"It is not a confusing movie. It's just confused. And with other defects too.Most of this cast are so pale. (Ryan Phillippe) and (Breckin Meyer) both look like children, or idiots. But while this partly could mean good casting for their simpleton characters, the real problem was that they didn't add anything to their roles; being uncharismatic, and without any depth at all. So how about being in the hands of a clueless script that has no depth or whatsoever?!The movie shows the atmosphere of New York in the late 1970s, and how some of the cream de la cream were living, or rather being doped. The sinking into this freedom of nightclub 54, so the developments of what it leads to moral collapses, are all clear. But suddenly, at the end, all of that turned into a mixed up stuff; the guys who were taking tons of drugs became suddenly clean?, the couple who was about to break became suddenly so in love??, and the movie which was a satire all along became suddenly an elegy???It came to a point where it cries over the days of 54 where the freedom was so unlimited; (Steve Rubell) says a real goodbye to his staff, while the movie says the same to these days, in unhappy farewell, saluting (Rubell), and his original dream of a club, with the hat off. So, as a whole, was it a movie about how filthy 54 was? Or was it a movie about how great it was? Was this movie's (Steve Rubell) a ground-breaker creator, a wise mentor, a symbol of sensual liberty that deserved to be missed in the modern BAD America? Or was he a repulsive degenerate, who loved only money, cocaine, and being in control, and built a destructive hellhole? It shows that Mr. (Mark Christopher), the movie's director who wrote it also, didn't ask these questions to himself in the first place!I didn't understand the problem of the 3 young leads while the movie was busy making a very shoddy love triangle between them. I didn't understand what's this movie's character mainly; anti 54 and the days of disco?, pro?, neutral historian?, anti and pro in the same time?! And I didn't feel joy out of the movie itself, since none of it was great or remarkable.I can't say that (Mike Myers) did it fine, since this script didn't make his character finely at all. He just stole the show being solidly serious, considering originally his reputation as a comic star, plus being - surely - the best actor in this bunch!I hate, truly hate, when I say about a movie: ""What did this one want?"". Simply because this can mean that this movie lost its meaning someway. And with this acting, directing, I hated the movie itself. It just looks like its leads.. confused; a fan of the illusionary colorful lights, and a discloser for their illusion in the same time.P. S: Now, there is a talk about a longer version, a director's cut, blah blah blah. Grrrrr! It didn't amuse me to the extent of seeking its right, un-shown, original. With many ""director's cut"" versions nowadays, I feel that this is exactly how to sell the expired goods twice!",54
19,dwpollar,Unspectacular rendition of the 'Studio 54' nightclub...,4,26 March 2001,1st watched 12/15/2000 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mark Christopher): Unspectacular rendition of the 'Studio 54' nightclub and it's allure from the perspective of a nobody who becomes a bartender there. Characters don't have much to them and the music is almost non-existent as a force behind this 70's piece of nostalgia.,54
20,ptb-8,the last days of disco,7,11 July 2010,"If you have a great home sound system and a big plasma TV then 54 can be a spectacular home experience. Unlike the real thing. STUDIO 54 as a disco scene is legendary but lemme tell ya, in Sydney in 1988-1994 we had the gigantic real thing: massive and spectacular dance parties (no NOT raves) but massive disco nights in a place that held 5000 people and staged Busby Berkeley sized massive dance entertainment. See any Kylie Minogue concert today to get a sense of we had for free at the time! They were called RAT parties and BACCHANALIA events. Often our own big disco clubs competed and it was massive and musical and a throb of wild night fun unlike anything I have seen in any movie anywhere. STUDIO 54 as a small movie version of what we know as gigantic and real in our own Australian lives and makes us look like Hollywood epic disco. What is in this film is quite puny and tacky compared to the real thing here. I thought the film was a good but could have been great disco drama. There has always been a call for a great BIG disco film or a dance party spectacular and Saturday NIGHT FEVER and 54 and even parts of WEST SIDE STORY about as close as we will get I guess. Ryan Phillippe is cute and Adonis and well cast as the pretty chipmunk bar boy, Brecken Myer believable in their NY suburban angst.... as is all the cast esp the girls Selma Hyack and gorgeous Neve Campbell...however the dialog at the end of the film where they reconcile is truly lame and lets the film down. I real life these characters would both end up as prostitutes. But it is Mike Myer pulling off another creepy performance (see CAT IN THE HAT for the other) that is the core of the film. Studio 54 as depicted in this almost-there setting looks like a stinky old cinema with nut-case clients and ghastly B grade celebrities. (Do The Time Warp, anyone?)I am glad I wasn't there for real as what happened here was real and astonishing. I hear there is a very sleazy and sexually explicit directors cut of 54 and that would be more to the mark as this is an almost-Disney version of what we can see had greater depths of nude depravity... all to a pulsating disco beat!",54
21,MarieGabrielle,My best friend loved this movie; so I rented it,1,16 February 2006,"and agree with most of the negative reviews. In fairness, I tried to give the film a chance, and watched it more than once.It isn't really the cast that ruins the non-existent script (was this ad-lib?; seems to be). Although one embarrassingly amateurish scene with Neve Campbell trying to sound like a New Yorker; ""waitress a cup of cawfeeee...."" like a teenager would even get waited on with that attitude; more likely she would have the coffee thrown in her face! Directed by Mark Christopher, I will have to read his bio, I doubt he has spent much time living or working in NYC.The cast tries their best; Salma Hayek; Ryan Phillipe (although he is a bit too naive at first) Mike Myers does look like Rubell(horribly so) and Sela Ward is attractive and vacuous. We also see the usual inferences to Andy Warhol, Princess Grace, etc.The real problem is, why do we care?. The first thing any writer or director must do is capture the INTEREST of the audience. We cannot care about these empty, coke-snorting characters, because they are one-dimensional. Overall, that is not the fault of the actor. The writer and director should oversee what they are projecting; and whether it does or doesn't work. This doesn't.Even ""Boogie Nghts"" at least had Philip Seymour Hoffman, an excellent actor. Rent that film, don't bother to watch this.",54
22,Boyo-2,Too bad,5,31 August 1998,"Too bad Disney didn't let the  director put out the movie he wanted.  It might have been good.  As it is, some parts are staggeringly dull, especially while Philippe is on the screen in particular.  Then other moments seem to catch the moments that made this time memorable and movie -worthy.  Mike Myers is terrific in the only performance of any merit, and Phillippe and Neve Campbell duke it out for worse performance.",54
23,Samiam3,Has nothing to sell,3,22 July 2010,"Despite all the music, dancing, flashy lights, and glitter, 54 wanders around blind deaf and dumb, making no progress and ends up amounting to nothing. What could be more frustrating than being asked to watch two hundred people party like it's 1999, and not getting a chance to be a part of it. The film is dull. It is set up a little like Boogie Nights (which itself was set up like Goodfellas) meaning of course that the story has a first person perspective, narration included with a blow by blow description of names places and faces, and ""what a good time it was"" or something like that. Too bad the narrator is a piece of cardboard, as is everyone else in the movie. Neve Campbell is the only one who feels human in her performance, yet she is given practically no screen time. If director Mark Christopher had bothered to spend as much time on character as he did on useless details like figuring out what color each light source should be, 54 may have amounted to something. It doesn't. Disco may be dead, but not half as much as this is.",54
24,triple8,Cmon down to 54,7,13 August 2003,"I liked this movie, it's not a 10 but certainly not a bad picture. I do agree that the focus should have been more on the happenings of the club itself but this happens a lot in true life stories turned into movies. Actually the movie could have been a lot worse.I think they did a reasonably good job, though not an exceptional one, of capturing the Glitz, glamor and mystery of the greatest nightclub in the world. You feel the appropriate sense of loss at the end of the movie and wish you had been there. I know I did. The NYC club scene is still alive and kicking but no other club will probably ever be as notorious as 54. I was really shocked this movie didn't do better at the box office but though I liked it, I agree it had flaws. The movie while capturing the atmosphere and time period strongly, and making one curious about Studio 54 and maybe wishing they'd gone at least once, didn't succeed in making the club's allure irresistible and the movie compellingly unforgettable and an instant classic as it should have, because all the tools were there for an unforgettable film.The movie should also have been MUCH LONGER. It still turned out much better then it could have though and is most definitely entertaining. I thought it was MUCH better then The last days of disco which I thought was horrible. I'd give it a 7 or 7.5 of 10 for the movie making, 8 of 10 for personal enjoyment though I'd really like to have seen this be a 10 all around, in the way of a ""Boogie Nights."" Still worth seeing though.",54
25,eric262003,Misleading Genre As It Plays Out Like A Comedy,6,1 December 2008,"Set in the late 1970's, Studio 54 is a trendy disco nightclub depicted in director/writer Mark Christopher's ""54"" which stars comical actor Mike Myers as the club's flamboyant kingpin and real life character Steve Rubell. But the leading star of ""54"" is Ryan Phillippe as a fictional Jersey boy Shane O'Shea with ambitions to seek employment in that club as he gets his feet wet into the establishment arranging tables as a busboy. Then as he progresses, much to the approval of Rubell, he gets promoted as a waiter and sugar daddy to the club's clientèle. Salma Hayek stars as Anita Randazzo, the club's coat check girl who's eloped to another busboy and roommate of Shane's, Greg Randazzo (Brecklin Mayer). Greg has his sights set on becoming a waiter, but due to his marriage commitments, he is deprived from his ambition, therefore making his dreams are sadly limited.What makes this movie only average at best is that the agonizing struggles of these fictional characters is that it's been rehashed and been done several times before. Critics who have expressed their harsh disdain on ""54"" compared the plot and the story as the weaker sister to ""Boogie Nights"", which was more successful at the box-office. I get the impression that the critics claim that ""54 steals most of their main ideas and themes, with only difference is that ""54"" is tamer than ""Boogie Nights"". While I agree to some extent that this movie isn't anywhere near perfect, and that there have been better disco-themed movies than this one, but what makes this film passable is that it has all the essential ingredients to make for a compelling movie. Unfortunately, the resources were not carefully featured.In the case of Steve Rubell, his climb to success from a steakhouse proprietor to a highly successful club owner gets very meager notability, leaving most of his content in the dark, while the main plot is centered around these stereotypical failures as the struggle to climb the corporate ladder in the nightclub enterprise, which to me lacks any kind of depth to the movie. One of the questions that crossed my mind was how did Rubell emerged from running a steak house to owning club that Princess Grace and Truman Capote visited regularly? That should have been the core of ""54"". What about the aftermath of Rubell after his imprisonment due to his club being shut down via tax violations? That's where the importance of the movie should have been. Instead we are forced into watching overdone ego-driven hyper-extended melodrama with bare-chested men in tight shorts in a movie with an abundance of loose ends.The acting as a whole was a snore casserole with a side order of yawn juice. But it's not entirely to be blamed by the actors, but perhaps due to the messy script. The big surprise comes from the performance of Mike Myers, breaking away from his comical roots to play an impressive portrayal as a restrained, but mysterious bar owner (I'm sure the real Rubell was more charismatic, if he was able to persuade Arab princes to his New York establishment). Salma Hayek is fun to watch as a coat-check girl who has aspirations to be a singer and paves the way for Shane into getting used to the customs and surroundings of the nightclub. It was a treat to watch the energetic geriatric Ellen Arbertini Dow get down and boogie as Disco Dotty (though her cussing was not all that necessary, even for an old woman). The scenery of this movie in terms of props and setting leaves much for one's desire.",54
26,m-47826,Legend through a looking glass.,8,13 September 2020,"It's weird how big and small this movie can be. Which don't take anything away from it. It's real quality storytelling, about a famous 70s club, seen through the eyes of a wannabe playboy that shares his journey with us viewers. Maybe it's not the most original plot, but it is made perfectly. The casting is top notch, and give great performances. Mike Myers being its cherry on top. I think he got an award for that. And rightfully so. The soundtrack is phenomenal and probably the best one on this subject. Disco. I love the dynamic between characters and how they evolve throughout the movie. Granted you're not spared some corniness, including a tragic death to pull your heart strings. But you fall for it willingly. I used to like this movie, mostly for the actors I knew. Now I love it, it's the closest you can get of nostalgia on film. And one that never gets old.",54
27,rivertam26,Director's cut,6,28 July 2020,"I suppose this cut leaves the promise of a better film. But to be honest I still prefer the guilty pleasure cut that was released in theaters. Centering around a sexy young man played by Ryan Phillippe who discovers the famous club in its hey day and is sucked into the glamorous nightlife becoming a drawing attraction. This version goes a bit more into the dirty details and isn't shy about showing the gay goods. But although there are some solid bits here and there. The movie feels disconnected and confusing. It jumps from scene to scene and doesn't bother trying to make it all make sense. The original cut for better or worse tells a fluid story with themes that come full circle even if it's a bit goofy.Budget: $18M
Box Office: $16.8M6/10",54
28,mattymatt4ever,This is a good movie! What was the problem?,7,7 January 2002,"Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.
Of course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, ""Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!"" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song ""Knock on Wood"" that they played over the credits.
My score:  7 (out of 10)",54
29,CitizenCaine,54: Pale Imitation Of Real Thing,5,21 February 2004,"A host of young stars make up the patrons and employees of studio 54 in this film that supposedly details the allure of the celebrated New York night club, which I believe operated from 1977 to 1986. Mike Myers portrays owner Steve Rubell, as a sad imitation of a man, who was full of his own excess. The film begins with a narrative focus on Ryan Phillippe as a naive young man looking to be a part of the excitement. The initial juxtaposition between him and how his friends dress is painfully accurate as I remember it. Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer play a troubled young couple trying to find success, even though they don't fit in. Sela Ward and Neve Campbell are on the screen all too briefly as an older woman seductress and a young ladder climber. Several other well known stars turn up in bit roles like Lauren Hutton, Michael York, and even porn star Ron Jeremy. However, as one reviewer pointed out, it was difficult to tell whether some actors were playing themselves or not. I guess it's reflective of the whole disco era, with people going into these clubs pretending to be someone else. Reportedly the director's cut was butchered by the studio due to negative reaction at advanced screenings, and it shows. What we have instead of a den of drugs and sex is a bland account of an insider's rise and fall as a bartender. Myers really carries the film when he's on screen. The soundtrack is typical of the era, but focuses more on lesser known songs; the film bypasses several mega-hits from the time. There have been a lot of complaints about the undeveloped characters and shallowness of it all, but the film does accurately illustrate just how shallow people are when it comes to promoting their own interests. Almost every major character in the film has a way of pushing people aside when they get in the way of perceived routes to success or well-being. And, that's what the 70's was: the ""ME"" decade. ** of 4 stars.",54
30,Tito-8,One fairly dull party,4,31 March 2000,"A group of dull, unappealing characters ruin what could have been an enjoyable look back at Studio 54.  Save possibly for Rubell, no one is even remotely interesting in this movie.  For me, at least, there was no reason to like any of the other main players, and so the film dragged quite frequently.  This isn't a complete disaster, since it does have the occasional entertaining scene and some decent performances, but in general, it's predictable and uninspired.  Don't waste your time with this one.",54
31,redkiwi,"Had promise, didn't really deliver",6,4 March 2001,"Must admit that I'm quite a fan of Mike Myers, but by the end of this film he was starting to annoy me.  Perhaps it's because he is so good as Austin Powers that the character seems to pervade everything else he plays also - such as Steve Rubell in this case.  There were moments that he sounded and acted like Powers far too frequent in 54.Rubell, the founder and owner of trendy NY nightclub 54, finally fell foul of the authorities as we all know; but the story of what happened and how is interesting all the same.It should have been a lot longer film, it was only starting to really go somewhere when it finished.Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillippe gave good performances, and Neve Campbell was absolutely gorgeous as usual, and is a really under rated actress at the same time, doing a good role as the soap star looking to get big.

Maybe if Cameron Crowe had directed this it would have been a lot better. The characters are not the most compelling or likable, but the Club itself looks like excellent fun. Myers is probably the best here, hamming his role perfectly, Neve is good but her character is not very appealing, Hayek unfortunately is given little to do, but does it well, and Phillipe's character is annoying, but he proves he isn't just a pretty boy by giving an okay performance. He has done better in other roles, just like the rest of the cast, but that isn't the fault of the actors. The story isn't involving enough, but there are some funny, and touching moments. The film was severely cut before release, maybe the original version would be better. The costumes and the music, and the sex and drugs are what keep this from being boring, but with a little more thought, and less cuts, this could have been very good 6 out of 10",54
35,Didier-Becu,54 (DIDIER BECU),8,6 April 2004,"Is it my fault or what? Why if I wanna praise a movie, I have to see that it's being turned down by most of the IMDB-voters? Anyway, ""54"" tells the story of the legendary Studio 54-discotheque in New York that was huge in the days of disco and that was known for its orgies, extravaganzas and endless days of disco. It tells the story of a Shane who lives at the other side of NY and who is picked up by the boss, who makes him a bartender. He soon sees what has to be done to make it (gaysex included) but he forgets his poor origin and climbs up to the ladder of stardom. ""54"" is a perfect movie for anyone who seek decadence with a discosoundtrack and for those who are at the end of their 30's, they all know the party's definitely over and fun never sounded so good. A real masterpiece that tells a real important part of popular music's history.",54
36,happipuppi13,"""54"" : The Little Brother Of Boogie Nights.",7,17 November 2006,"I want it understood first off,that I ""know"" this is a good film. The story is good,the acting,the sets,the 70s era wardrobe & musicand the (mostly) factual story of the fall of New York City's Studio 54 disco club.I liked what saw,the thing of it is...some of it had already been done in ""Boogie Nights"". The two films do have similar set-ups. In both,a young misunderstood teen/20 something boy leaves home because of his parents negativity. This made it seem,unfortunately like a copy-cat film.In this one though,the young man who goes to work at Studio 54 sort of gets shoved aside for other inter-weaved story lines. SNL alum Mike Meyers was great as the club's owner and showed that he can be a fairly serious actor. Playing a man who can't see (in his drug induced haze)that his success is slipping away from him to the point of collapse.I'm not rating this 5 stars because there's substandard acting or bad production values here, it's just because in following on the heels of ""Boogie Nights"",it could have used a different set up for the story.I feel that is what caused it's box-office return to be less than spectacular. In fact...the day I saw it,there was only one other person in the entire audience. (Possibly)if not for ""B.N."" ;this could have been a bigger and better film in the eyes of the public. It's still great though.(END)",54

40,CriticsVoiceVideo,Pretty accurate time capsule.,9,24 February 2021,I'm basing my rating on the directors cut version since it doesn't have it's own entry. I would say it's a two star difference. A young bartender's journey into the New York City club scene and nightlife via legendary club Studio 54 in the late 1970s. See the unrated director's cut for the full scope of Shane54's journey. It gives an even more accurate depiction of the time period and scene. I do prefer the ending of this version though.,54
41,pkzeewiz,Great movie - not sure why it wasn't more popular.,6,9 April 2010,"When I first watched this movie, I just knew it would be one of those films I would watch every couple years and it would never grow old to me. This made maybe my 10th viewing and I still enjoyed it.Studio 54 in the late seventies was THE place to be, clubs weren't as relevant as they are nowadays and even so 54 was the kind of place that people off the streets could hang out with movie stars and rock singers, anyone who was anyone had to be there. It was ran by a man named Steve Rubell and he was somewhat of a god in that world. Everyone wanted to be his friend, and he just wanted money, sex and drugs. He was embezzling money from his own company and not letting the IRS find out about it, but when word got out his place was shut down quickly and he went to jail.Ryan Phillippe plays Shane, a character based on Tieg Thomas, a bi-sexual party boy who became a bartender and a star because of his time at 54. Shane however was straight and fell in love with a soap star on this movie and he and the girl he falls for have to realize that life and love is more important than selling yourself out.Side note...there is another director's cut of this film out there based more on Tieg's life having lots more sex and bisexual encounters, director Mark Christopher may release it anytime, he got lots of clearance for the DVD release, but there's still lots more to be seen on DVD.Mark did a really great job directing this movie film and with all the lights and action going on in the club he captured the right things at the right times, his use of slow motion is perfect. He is mostly famous for doing gay cinema and shorts like those seen on the ""Boys Life"" series, and his work here far outshines those.Acting wise this was a gem. Ryan Phillippe is a good guy, I have met him and he's such a great guy in person that I could never judge him on film, but I will say he did a great job and thats not biased, he's nothing at all like the cocky Shane character he played here and he did good with the Jersey accent. Mike Myers may have did his best acting job ever here, we've all seen him do these crazy characters such as Austin Powers but here he's playing a real person and this movie is not at all comedy and he pulls off a serious acting job, it is so hard to believe this is Mike Myers. Neve Cambell also did her best work here in my opinion, early in her career but trying to play an older more sophisticated Jersey girl in the New York circle. Other great actors included Breckin Meyer, Heather Matarazzo, Ellen Dow and Sela Ward. Salma Hayak was the balance though, that girl cant act in a movie unless Robert Rodriquez is directing her.Of course disco was the music of this time, and I thought the music here was very fitting, the songs were as important as anything when one of your stars is the club and the dance floor. Nice original music too, and glad to see a Bachman-Turner Overdrive thrown in the mix.Great movie I recommend it to drama lovers, bio-pic lovers, disco lovers and just anyone looking for a way to kill an afternoon enjoying a film. 6 out of 10 stars.",54
42,trokanmariel-17760,"The left, or the magic L's secret destination",9,21 September 2021,"Does deconstruction mean top to bottom, or bottom to top? Let's try having a go at the answer.Deconstruction, means to take apart. To take apart means or invokes to take down. It can be either, is the answer.I like the phraseology, of ""to take down"". Since the real life history of 54 was about taking the club down. But why the emphasis, on top to bottom/bottom to top?(Is Peek-A-Boo interested in me, by inherent birthright, irrespective of future, or is she interested in me because of my zen?)54 (1998) is the story of a building. For the building to function, there needs to be black underneath the upper to mid-upper levels. However, the upper to mid-upper levels are supposed to be at the exact mid level.Wales won't do, because even though the outline of Rhyl's arcades mirrors the established criteria, for the building to function, the outline shot of Rhyl is generic - the building is already generic.So, the building is generic. Meaning, it is fair: the darkness is meant to be covered up. So, the generic creates the end (the end justifies the means).I started with top to bottom/ bottom to top, and have arrived at the end/ the end. Does this mean that I have succeeded?Blade Runner's (the original Blade Runner's) own architecture-sociology is very similar, to 54, only, naturally, the instance with Blade Runner is much more out of the blue (not a Woman In Blue dig); it's a dig up.The late 90's, relative to the entire history of space-time. Where is the late 90's?In fact, this is where Rhyl might be useful. Relative, to sociology history, it becomes manageable to ""see"" and ""feel"" the generic building as being its 2D self, pushed against by the vacuum of outer space - from the building front's right hand side.This means that the left, or the magic L is doing the pushing, which makes sense. By the oppressor being the left, it means that there is no loser in the war.Let's do a trade:

45,budmassey,"Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.",9,17 May 2001,"Studio 54 was the center of a universe that revolved around sex, drugs, and a pantheon of ephemeral pop culture gods who presided over a world of decadence and music.  Long before the neanderthal ""disco sucks"" mob convinced the world to stop dancing, every possible indulgence was explored, and then surpassed, in clubs like this one across the country. Well, if there had been clubs like this, but there was only one 54.The story mirrors the lunatic time warp within great dance clubs.  There was a cast of characters, you kind of knew them, and you knew some of the details of their lives outside the club, but make no mistake, the real world took place under the seductive lights, and everything else was just backstage preparation.You might say that the myriad subplots that ran through 54 were not adequately explored by the movie, but that would be naive.  Nobody at the club really knew Warhol, Jagger, Grace Kelly, Capote, or any of the luminaries, famous or not, who inhabited the club like ghosts.  We drank from their lives from dusk till dawn and hibernated in the so-called real world until the stars came out at night.Mike Meyers is beyond fabulous as the complex and tragic Steve Rubell.  If Ryan Phillippe is no Oscar winner, you might recall that the real busboys weren't usually National Merit Scholars either.  They were beautiful, and that was all that mattered.The giddy yet tragic abandon of the Disco Days has never been captured so perfectly.  Everyone knew it couldn't last, but we all stuck it out to see who could make it till last call.  An era as beautiful and optimistic as the hippies and flower children of the 1960's drowned under the weight of the resentment of those who couldn't make it past the velvet rope.This movie is the absolute best of its genre, and unflinchingly reveals the darkness that lay under the glittering veneer of 54.  If you weren't there, you won't understand.  If you were, there is no better way to remember. Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.",54
46,oshram-3,Tepid approach to interesting subject matter,4,9 October 2006,"If you hit your teens in the 70s, as I did, you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco. An exclusive club, it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption; there's even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday, and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.Sadly, this isn't it. 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees, a bartender named Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a busboy named Greg (Breckin Meyer), his wife, a coat-check girl, Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course the master of ceremonies himself, Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers). While the goings-on at the club are well represented, this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers, following Shane's story the closest.The movie works in spurts. Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture (such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who 'Errol Flynt' is), and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama. Some of that is inherent in the premise  following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie. While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night, the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on; and Rubell himself, while his excesses are mentioned, come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar, a cheat, a drug abuser, and promiscuous as all hell. Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here, but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate. A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.Meyers does his best to capture Rubell, but he's given so little to work with here it's surprising his performance is effective; but he's good, and he helps to anchor the film. Philippe, whom I find generally to be a good actor, is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character; he's limited to a deer-in-the-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he can't translate that into a strong performance. Hayek and Meyer are both okay, again, undercut by the writing, and Neve Campbell  prominently featured on the DVD cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.For some reason I still find myself interested, even fascinated, by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies. But even given that, this is not a film that particularly engaged me, despite a predisposition to like it. I'd say if that era, or that club, has any interest for you, track down the VH1 special rather than this middle-of-the-road melodrama.",54
47,thefan-2,"Not bad, not great",6,11 September 1999,"I wasn't crazy about 54.  The expensive-looking set wasn't very convincing.  Neve Campbell is a fine actress, but even she couldn't bring her hackneyed character to life -- the weary, ""I bet you think this is glamorous,"" actress who finds coffee and conversation at a simple diner more rewarding than drugs and dancing at fabulous ""Studio,"" as everyone called it (wouldn't've made a very good title, though).  Mike Myers' sustained impression of Steve Rubell was okay.  5 out of 10.",54
48,llihilloh,Ryan and the film overall is good.,7,9 August 2001,"First off I would like to mention that I wasn't born until many years after 54 closed its doors. So, I don't really have anything to compare the film to. But despite of not knowing about the real club, I enjoyed the movie very much.Many people criticize '54' saying that it did a terrible job of depicting the actual club scene while others commend it for bringing the New York happening spot to life. All I know is that I love anything 60s and 70s so I obviously liked this film. The clothes are good, the music is better than today's and Studio 54 looked like THE place to be. The story line following a New Jersey nobody seems pretty simple. He hits New York, visits the club and in no time is the bartender. I thought that it was an excellent choice in casting Ryan Phillippe in the role of Shane O'Shea.Phillippe's role doesn't look like it needed a whole lot of work put into because once again, it is a simple picture of a young man set out to make something of himself. But he does his best nonetheless. O'Shea was created well. Another young actor I particularly like is Breckin Meyer. He did a very good acting job but there was something wrong with his character. Greg seemed as if he had a purpose there in the beginning but after a while he slowly moved into the darkness and just became someone who hooked Shane up with a place to stay. Salma Hayek seems to be a popular name now days. I must say that I'm not too interested in seeing her anything. I've seen her in one or two movies before seeing her in '54' and I still don't get why everybody likes her. Not good acting on her part. Neve Campbell who is definitely not one of my favorite actresses plays a minor role in this film but they make it seem like she's in the lead. I won't comment too much on her since she once again chose a bad character to act out. And Mike Myers who plays the club owner, Steve Rubell, probably does the best next to Ryan Phillippe. It's not that Myers is such a terrific actor, it's just that he didn't have any competition (sorry Breckin). But still he played out the role his best. The cast was pretty good overall. I thought that the re-creation of Studio 54 was very good. Again, I didn't know the real one but it looked so fantastic in there. Lights, dancing, music, it seemed as if the people had it made. The score for the movie wasn't anything too too great. The music was good, don't get me wrong, but I've heard better. So, the story line following O'Shea was good. The acting was mixed with some good some bad. The writing was decent and the script as a whole was one of the better ones. See this even if you aren't familiar with the club itself. '54' gives a pretty good idea of what went on and how it finally came to an end.",54

Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Sela Ward, Breckin Myer, Sherry Stringfield, Jay Goede. Uneven if entertaining story about the famed 1970s New York nightclub, as told through the eyes of a young bartender (Phillipe). The cinematography and set pieces are spectacular and the film really catches the look and feel of the late 1970s. Although Myers delivers a notable performance as the nightclub owner Steve Rubell, the film belongs to Phillipe, who has never looked hotter. Campbell has a disappointing lack of screen time. RATING: 7 out of 10. Rated R for violence, sexual situations, profanity, and drug use.",54
50,IrisNo11,"Unique, Interesting, and Excellent",9,1 July 1999,"My oh my!  I loved ""54"" very much!  The film was very unique, very interesting, and different than most films!  I loved the set of the night club itself and I loved the attitude and nature of the characters in this film.  What I was a little disappointed about was the fact that they didn't really have a lot of the celebrities that went to Studio 54 back then such as Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Halston, Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Cher, just to name a few.  And where is the other owner of Studio 54, Ian Schweggar (or however you spell his name)?  The movie I guess you could say highlighted the lives of the more common people rather than the big stars and icons who were at 54 every night during the late 1970's.  My cousin, Jimmy, went to Studio 54 back in the late 1970's when he was a teenager.  I think he was the same age as Shane during that period.Yet I give this film a lot of credit.  It was very glamorous, very exciting to watch, and above all, it was so much fun to watch!  Ryan Phillepe is a great actor, very talented, and he is soooo cute!  Reese Witherspoon is a lucky girl!  Mike Meyers wasn't the best Steve Ruebell, but I can't really imagine anyone else to play the part of the famous S.R.!This movie is a must see!",54
51,BB-15,Studio Fifty Bore,3,25 November 1999,"You would think that a movie about Studio 54 would focus on the life of Steve Rubel. But why make sense? This film is Boogie Nights meets disco. The stars are small time employees of Studio 54 who want to be famous but whose careers go nowhere. The film could have been about any famous disco club and it would not have changed the story very much. Boogie Nights did this story ten times better. In 54 the lives of our young struggling characters are not explored in any depth and the gaps in the story are huge. When a bus boy steals 10 thousand why isn't he fired? Instead Rubel's top financial assistant is fired for stealing the money but Rubel says later he knew she didn't do it. 54 seems to have half a script.As for the acting, the stars, Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer just don't carry the film. Hayek is often terrible with her Elvis sneer. Phillipe and Meyer can go back to TV and won't be missed. My advice to Neve Campbell; stay away from bombs like this. The decent performances by Mike Meyers and Sela Ward give a hint that with a good script, competent actors and the same interesting sets, there could have been a good film here.
As Studio 54 plodded on, the dialogue became more ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh at the Rubel welcome back party with Hayek in a terrible wig and Mike Meyers waving at our nobody main characters who he couldn't see 100 feet away and whom the real Rubel wouldn't have remembered. But then the best part of Studio 54 happened. This stinker ended.",54
52,wilsonstuart-32346,Infernal Disco,6,29 December 2018,"The irony that my 54th review should be on this film....As a big fan of Salma Hayek I had a long wait for '54', one of a slew of late 1990's projects that examined the decadent and excessive 1970s club scene. If Boogie Nights (a personal favourite of mine) set the pace, what could I expect from a high powered cast of (mostly) then favourites and a young director who was considered to be in the rise?Truth be told, I found 54 something of a frustrating experience. This ought to have been a powerhouse drama, with a dream back story, and an equally able cast. Yet it never really ignites the way it ought to have done. Firstly, there was not enough focus on Mike Meyers's ruthless, materialistic club svengali. It was a pity that Meyers never sought to build on this dramatic success, instead opting to spend the remainder of the decade in misfiring comedies (Austin Powers excepted); had 54 concentrated on the relationship with an effective Ryan Philippe - tailor made for a pretty boy reliant on looks and shallow charm- then this might have been a different film. Phillippe manages to a fair job here, but cannot quite make the effort required to stamp himself on proceedings.Instead, there's too much emphasis on a tepid 'love triangle' between the underwritten Salma Hayek (who later disowned the role - nothing particularly wrong with her effort but see above), and a hopeless Breckin Meyer. Meyer's hapless everyman routine is fine in the likes of Road Trip or Rat Race, but he totally lacks either looks, charisma or credibility that his role demands. Neve Campbell puts in little more than a glofied cameo; sorry to say, but almost anyone could have played her part.I'm not being overly harsh or unfair. This is not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination, but I honestly felt that it could have been better. It makes a fair stab in terms of atmosphere and pathos, but I just felt it was lacking in certain areas where the likes of Boogie Nights, Go or even Party Monster succeeded. I understand that there's cut footage/deleted scenes out that there that may have made a major impact on the storyline - perhaps the kind of impact that Mark Christopher, Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillipe intended (perhaps). Until this material is properly assessed, I'm only reluctantly willing to endorse 54. A bit like that party you were looking forward to going to. You know, the one that never quite got started?",54
53,Niro,Everything Mike Myers Touches Turns To Gold,10,25 February 2000,"Virtual unknown Mark Christopher's ""54"" came out at essentially the same time as Stillman's ""The Last Days of Disco,"" and most of us who are still Stillman hopefuls were expecting a TKO.Sadly though, even with Kate Beckinsale in the cast, ""Days"" finishes a poor second.Mike Myers, in his first truly dramatic role, is absolutely superb as the ubiquitous and egocentric Steve Rubell ~ the man who literally invented trendy~but~exclusive NYC hot~spots with his Studio 54.But Myers is merely the thread which holds several subplots together. 
Most of these involve lowlife Jersey kid, ""Shane"" [Ryan Phillippe], who happens upon the club nearly by accident.  Shane, via several personally~compromising situations, is fairly~quickly elevated to ""waiter"" status which, at 54, meant overnight stardom.Neve Campbell, as an ex~Jersey girl who has made it semi~big on a soap opera, excels as the object of Shane's desires.Salma Hayek, in what is likely her best performance thus far, is terrific as the disco star wannabe.I continue to be amazed with Mike Myers ~ even when he's not doing his comedy schtick, he makes it work.  This is a true oddity for ex~SNL personnel: Bill Murray, John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd's attempts at drama have been at best adequate [depite Aykroyd's nomination for the awful ""Driving Miss Daisy""] and at worst, deplorable [all of Aykroyd's other work].The guy is gold.  Buy his IPO when it shows up on Wall Street.",54
54,RJBose,Weak and Disjointed,6,20 January 2003,"The story of Steve Rubel and of Studio 54 (the famous night spot of the elite on New York's 54th Street in an old ABC TV studio) is a facinating one which encapsulates much of the atmosphere of excess which characterized that era; this movie, ""54"" which purports to tell that story through the eyes of Shane, one of Rubel's employees, fails miserably in its attempt.  What we get instead is Reese Witherspoon's husband presented as a shiftless but handsome youth from Jersey City (a working class town directly across the Hudson River) yearning for the excitment of the ""Big City"" in a banal ""Cinderella"" tale.Mike Myers is brilliant as Steve Rubel, the club's creator, a drug swilling homosexual who likes to surround himself with pretty boys. Enter Mr. Witherspoon's ""Shane"" who catches Rubel's eye while trying to gain admittance one night into the fabled lair of the famous. Through some oblique family connection Shane is introduced to Rubel, and is offered a job as a busboy. So far, so good.At this point the film loses direction (perhaps literally) as instead of learning the secrets of what went on in the club- facinating bits about basement VIP rooms and drug pipelines only alluded to in passing, we are instead served up a lame story of Shane's attraction for a famous TV star and (Neve Campbell) who frequents the club, and an entngled relationship with Shane's fellow busboy's pretty wife (Miss Hayuk).Out of nowhere Shane is suddenly driving a Camero with custom plates and living the high life, but inexplicably is still living in a small apartment with his two fellow employees- and by the way, how a busboy and hatcheck girl could afford a two bedroom apartment in the City is just another careless detail in this sloppy mess.As many other have said, ""Boogie Nights"" does a much better job of conveying the mood and music of the period, and also tells a more interesting story of the characters involved, in frankly a very similar story.There was a good story to be told here, but we never can get past the door.",54
55,tylerrosin,One Of My Top Ten Favourite Movie Ever,10,27 May 2008,"I will say right now that i loved this movie. Mike Myers was perfect for this part i was so shocked at how good he portrayed Steve Rubell. The music in this movie was so perfect that i watch in almost every month just to listen to the soundtrack. Ryan Phillpe was the best choice for Shane O'Shea because how he looked and that age and the innocence look he had during the movie, this i think was for sure his best role. And this movie had one of the most depressing parts when the old grandma died on the dance floor because she was having so much fun that part almost made me cry the way everyone just kept on dancing. This movie had a execellent cast of very famous actors like Salma Heyek and Brecklin Myers. And the last song i always get goosebumps. its called "" if you could read my mind"". also a lot of people complain that the movie did not follow the real club but i think that would have been very boring this was a much better idea. Words can't really describe this movie if you like Mike Myers you have to see this movie, or if you just want a really good fun movie you owe yourself to watch this movie.",54
56,Time Tripper,I liked Mike Meyers.,5,5 January 2001,"Ryan Phillipe plus Selma Hayek...did this movie stand a chance?  AND Neve Campbell?  It must be really easy to get a job as a casting director anymore. This movie is partially based on a true story.  THAT part of the movie was good.  Mike Meyers is clearly a good actor.  (You gotta admit, the guy who brought Wayne Campbell AND Austin Powers to life must have something going for him, even if you didn't like those movies.)  The whole ""downfall of Studio 54"" would have been a good movie by itself, but THEY JUST HAD TO add the other idiot characters. Despite Meyers' talent, this movie is a pale shadow of ""The Last Days of Disco"" and ""Boogie Nights"" (the other entries in what I call the ""Death of the 70's"" genre...if there are other movies in this category, please let me know).",54
57,Dock-Ock,Knock on Wood,8,26 February 2003,"54 is a great movie for nostalgia pundits such as myself. It is an affectionately made journey through the looking glass to back to the late 70's and early 80's. It has a great soundtrack and enjoyable performances by Ryan Philippe, Selma Hyack and the like. Of course the man who steals the show is Mike Myers who is hillarious as Steve Rubell. The Script centres alot of the attention on Myers and Rubell, because he is quite simply the most interesting of the ensemble characters in the movie. I dont know too much about Rubell but Myers manages to make him a likeable character despite being nothing short of a bastard. Where the movie lets it's self down is that there is practically no style to the direction or even the script, so we dont see anything we havent seen before. Philippe's opening narration goes for a Goodfella's style feel, while the movie tries mercifully to drag it's self out of the shadow of Boogie Nights. Director Mark Christopher seems to be trying to hold back the feeling of excess instead of succumbing to what is natural. This is a pity because the movie could have benefited alot more from doing just that. Overall though, as it stands 54 is an enjoyable, watchable -Grade Mike Myers showcase with some great tracks {Knock on Wood for one} and some solid performances.",54
58,ivana-7,a waste of time,2,10 August 1999,"1st of all I didnt want to see this movie but my friend forced me cause she is crazy about Ryan Phillippie. The story line is boring, the acting is bad. I even went to the bathroom, and belive me I never go to the bathroom during a movie cause I hate to miss anything. The only good thing about this bad movie is that Phillippie is half naked most of the movie.",54
59,bicgus1,This is true underrate (and it's the first time I say so),9,14 July 2006,"No doubt it is VERY underrated. I'm not saying that it should have a 9.x but it should make it over 7 for sure. To begin with, the script which is in part (if not all) documentary, is extremely captivating. Second, there is an overlooked wonderful acting from Mike Myers doing Steve Rubell. Perfect representation of that kind of person. Dustin Hoffman (one of my favorites) couldn't have done it better if chosen for the cast. Third... it's amusing all the way long. This movie keeps your attention high amongst other reasons because you quickly understand the fact that some things are going to happen necessarily because the statu quo shown there cannot resist too long in time. Strongly recommended.",54
60,EAA123,Love this movie!!,10,5 April 2012,"I've just finished watching the new extended version and love the new scenes. I was slightly disappointed not seeing the scenes from the director's cut I've heard so much about. I hope I get to see the director's cut sometime soon. Many thought the original was a flop and missing something. Having experienced the Disco era both as a DJ and a patron, I feel it's a true representation of the Disco era, the last era of true freedom. I also was fortunate enough to go Studio 54 myself. I've studied this movie for screen writing purposes. I've written a similar time period piece. Understanding the nuances of writing, I don't understand why important footage was left out just for time consideration. It wasn't too long to begin with. Personally I'd rather spend a few extra minutes seeing an entire uncut movie and getting the full experience. The love triangle scenes between Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek & Breckin Meyer may have been considered to risqué at the time the original movie was released, though is an accurate portrayal of the period. These scenes were left out this version as well. I gave the movie 10 stars and suggest everyone see it!! I also love the soundtrack and hats off to the cast!",54
61,j_graves68,...the soundtrack's better,5,18 July 2005,"""54""- a 1998 release of a fictionalized account of the late seventies' notorious nightclub that's peppered with drugs, decadence, and debauchery in the POV of a dimbulb from across the river that separates New Jersey from New York. Ryan Phillipe is the leading, narrating it-guy (I think this film actually helped destroy his career). Salma Hayek was the it-girl and played a philandering wife to Breckin Meyer (who, by the way, was HORRIBLY miscast to play her husband- no way Salma would ever touch him). Neve Campbell (all 10 minutes of her) played the soap star on the down, which incidentally mirrored her real-life career as well. Mike Myers as Steve Rubell stole the whole show. He played it with so much charisma, you couldn't help but to root for this freak. And even though Myers didn't look a whole lot like Rubell, he was not his usual over-the-top self and the subtle Linda Richman (SNL) voice he used, made the whole delivery work. Sela Ward had a small role in this as a hot-stuff, wired, record producer, but then again, EVERYONE had minuscule parts. Sherry Stringfield played his strung-out confidant Viv (and looked like she lost weight to the point of being unrecognized), along with Heather Matzarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", ""The Princess Diaries"") as Ryan Phillipe's younger sister.The film had potential. It seemed decent most of the time, and you wanted to know a little more with what was going on in each scene. Yet it seemed more like watching an extended British theatrical trailer. An example was when Shane (Phillipe) is bummed that the magazine he posed for didn't have any text. Well, we never knew he even posed in the first place, but it must've been a piece that was snipped in order not to fully enjoy this subplot. The only problem is that there were multiple scenes that suffered from this same lack of coherence. The movie must have originally been three hours long, but the execs had to snip about half the footage for whatever reason. The result is a contorted, contrived, unremarkable film that doesn't even carry half the songs on film that are embedded in its soundtrack.I did feel (as I did with ""Boogie Nights"") that I was in fact watching a documentary of the late 70s, and old memories of where I was at that time go-go danced in the back of my head. The Director of Photography deserves props (like the DPs to ""American Psycho"" & ""Boogie Nights"" do). I was only eight when this movie took place, but I remember where I was on New Year's Eve of 1979. But this film unfortunately tried to cram as much '70-isms and references as possible. When Breckin Meyer reaches for his wife, she says, ""Sit on it!"" Or when Shane and Meyer are the wild & crazy Czechoslovakian Brothers (Dan Aykroyd & Steve Martin in the '70s heyday of SNL). See my review of ""Boogie Nights"", you'll know what I mean. And I didn't buy that Shane (who wasn't a real sharp tool to begin with) magically goes to NYU and is a manager of a restaurant at the movie's end.All in all, the movie was dramatic in parts where it shouldn't have been; had no humor where it should have; was shorter than it should have been; and had scenes that shouldn't have been. The end credits were cool to watch because of all the celebrities and icons of the time were there: Liza Minelli, Martin Scorcese, Farah Fawcett, John Travolta, Sylvester Stallone, and even the Governator of California.Not a bad film, but by no means a good one.",54
62,bbagnall,24 Hour Party People is way better,6,26 April 2004,"This is a pretty standard telling of Studio 54, a nightclub that I never heard of but was apparently famous in New York. Frankly there just isn't much exciting in the movie. People dance, people party, people drink and do drugs. I'm not a stickler for stories with conventional story arks, but something of interest should happen on screen. This movie just plays it by the book. Ryan Phillip is pretty good in his role. Neve Campbell as usual has absolutely no chemistry with her fellow actors. In contrast, 24 Hour Party People is witty, imaginative, and absolutely alive with characters. If you are looking explore the 80's music scene, you can do a lot better than this film.",54
63,davidholmesfr,Last days of disco movies?,5,24 February 2002,"It seems that making the definitive New York disco movie is a lost cause. Both Whit Stillman's `Last Days of Disco' and Christopher's `54' make valiant but doomed attempts.The problem with `54' is, like `Last Days' the characters lack depth. But perhaps this is no accident given the artificiality of the scene both movies set out to portray. Compared to ballroom dancing, or to be more accurate, `Strictly Ballroom' where the environment is populated with people dedicated in their own individual ways to succeed, the disco scene is a hard seam to mine. Whereas `Last Days' focuses on regulars who frequent the disco, here we focus on an employee. `54' takes as its central character Shane O'Shea (Phillippe), a New Jersey kid who is bored with life on the wrong side of the tracks, or, more accurately, the wrong side of the Hudson River. So he crosses into New York City, joins the queue of hopefuls hoping to be allowed into `54', and manages to get in by the rather unlikely process of removing his shirt (a scene recalled towards the end of the movie when he is thrown out of the same disco, again shirtless). From here on we follow his rise as an employee to the dizzy heights of bartender, a position that in the world of disco appears to be equivalent to a leading Wall Street bond trader. Phillippe is too lightweight in the role for us to really care too much about his fate. Mike Myers makes a reasonable stab at playing the role of Steve Rubell, `54's charismatically odd owner. Unfortunately he has a tendency, in several scenes, to look a bit like the toothy British comedian Ken Dodd and I was half expecting him to come out with Dodd's old saying `How tickled I am, missus'. Given some of Myers's lines it might actually have been worked.In the end Rubell is hit by the IRS  given the amount of drugs being wheeled and dealed in the place he probably got the lesser of two evils. And as Ken Dodd also got into a little bit of difficulty with the UK's revenue service the parallels were just too much. All in all, like `Last Days of Disco', this is a sorry effort. Perhaps the whole Manhattan disco scene can now be quietly condemned to the trashcan of movie history.",54
64,xenazues,Underrated,7,26 January 2017,"I guess people are reviewing this movie as compared to around 1998. We seem to remember a lot of the great movies (depending on who you talk to) were like late 70's early 80's, the godfathers, and the star wars and so on. But seriously the 90's made some really hard core classics that the quotes are still around today. Forrest Gump, people still quote that. That movie was 1994. Saving Private Ryan, then you have Schindler's List, Titanic was 97. So when this movie came out you pretty much were up against the 90's and big name movies.So I can understand how this didn't leave a good taste in peoples mouth. Plus all the talk of the late 70's and early 80's, which is still my favorite decade of music. I agree with every one about Michael Myers character. It was simply off the chain. You could tell he prepared for his role. And honestly I don't know how Steve rubell acted in real life. And frankly it doesn't matter, mike Myers still performed great.Salma Hayek was just a beauty. A pure beauty back then and probably is now. Older or not. Great person to show in this movie. This was the decade of some drop dead gorgeous women with natural looks. The Pam Griers, farrah Farcetts, who ever played that girl in night rider, wonder woman, and all the charlie's angels. You name it those girls knew how to look good. Frankly in 2017 I'm not impressed. But to find some one in 1998 with that kind of natural beauty wasn't easy either. She played the part very well. Although her part wasn't as big as it should have been, it was definitely key to this movie.Ryan part in this movie as Shane was all over the place. Probably where people had a hard time relating to. I mean they didn't really talk much about his family. And they played the whole dad was a drunk and didn't care about my life theme too much. As a matter of fact I wish directors would quit playing that scene out. Its old and pretty much the characters who play it in movies don't do it right. The dad just seemed out of place as well as the sisters.Now that I think about it, Ryan shouldn't even have been the main character. He didn't really live up to the 70's and early 80's and Nev Campbell is hardly convincing of somebody who ""is doing what it takes to get on top"". And I'm not sure if they cut out a lot of sex scenes but for the late 70's early 80's they needed a lot more sex and drugs. As matter of fact this movie if it was made in the early 80's would have been great.All the other characters honestly aren't worth talking about. And I have to be honest. I love this movie. But its more like a guilty pleasure. If I'm writing an honest review of the quality of the film and acting. Its not very well for what they could have had. Where they were suppose to give an account of a bar where anything went. Sex, drugs and just simply a lot of questionable behavior. They simply went on about a bartenders life and how he got be at studio 54.They should have just had the show focus on Myers and how he was the owner of the bar and what kind of business deals was he in. Would have been much more interesting. Or simply recast the character, make tom cruise play the part of Shane and then go far on about how salma and who ever played Shane were having an affair and then honestly ditch Nev and go with Denise Richards and that would have been a hit.But they didn't. Its still a show worth watching. I love watching it, but it could have been better. I remember that decade from 75 to 85 as the greatest and most unique when it came to music and just experimenting with fun. The movie makes it seem like pretty good but boring at times with a bunch of people just trying to make it and falling in line when they are told. I didn't grow up in that decade, so maybe it was like that. But that doesn't stop people from making the 50's into pleasantville now does it?",54
65,scandinavianmail,54 Director's Cut,8,18 April 2017,"This movie should only be reviewed as the 2015's Director's Cut which is far superior to the original theatrical cut.

66,sraweber369,54 A look back,6,25 March 2011,54 is the story of the famed New York night club by the same name. The movie was OK at best. The main problem is that the characters do not live up to the excitement of the famed club.The story revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillipee) WHO is a Jersey boy and lands a job at the club. He is soon promoted by Steve (Mike Meyers). I have a problem with this for what boss promotes someone to bar tender with no previous experience. Well Steve is skimming money from the till to hide it from it from the IRS. In the mean time Anita who works in the coat check (Selma Hyak) is aspiring to be a singer.While Meyers gives a very good understated performance as Steve the rest of the characters are only marginally interesting. So the movie just kind of winds down to the eventual conclusion. Making this a rather forgetful movie experience.,54

Steve Rubbel was the owner of 54 and most hated man of clubbing and night life of the The Big Apple (NY). He was convicted for unpaid taxes because that was the only way how to remove him from the show. But, that's not something what is really possible, cause show must go on. Always.",54
68,TobyS,Empty...,6,1 October 2001,"54 was one of the films of 1998 I-was-waiting-for.  I'm still waiting...Give us the directors cut!!!Based on a couple of gay-theme shorts Mark Christopher did, Miramax hired him to write and direct what was supposed to be a realistic portrayal of the infamous NYC night club, Studio 54.  According to people involved, Christopher did just that.  His film showed an unflinching view of the late '70s.  Sex, both gay and straight occupied much of the club, and the drugs ran rampant.  I don't know what his version contained, but it HAS to be better than what was released into theatres. The story, as it is now, revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey kid who ends up bussing at 54.  The movie focuses on is rise to the top, and then dramatic fall.  Mike Myers turns in one of his best performances of his career as club owner, Steve Rubel.  Ryan Phillippe, who usually has a limited acting ability, shows a glimmer of a great performance trying to break free.  And, as far as Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, why were they in the movie again?  I can't quite figure it out.  Lord knows, the only reason Neve Campbell was there was to add another name to the marquee.  54 as it is, is a mess.  Not much makes sense, and I didn't care whatsoever about any of the characters.  I didn't care because I never got a chance to. The editing is choppy, dialogue reeks of quick re-writes, and the movie is tamer than most stuff put out under the Disney label.  Hey, Miramax, remember The Crying Game?  Priest?  Kids?  You used to take chances with your films, and stood behind the filmmaker. Now it seems your interested solely in the 'ole mighty buck!54 had to have been the biggest letdown of the summer of '98 - and there were some pretty big let downs that summer.  I urge Miramax to let Christopher release the version he shot (at least on DVD), because as it is now, it's an embarrassment to all those involved, and to all of us who were first in line to witness this hatchet job.My Grade: C-",54
69,centropolis,Very sad.,2,26 July 2000,"My age:14This movie is not sad because it has dramatic characters. It is sad that it wasted so much talent. 1. I do not like Ryan Phillipe or Neve Cambell. 2. Salma Hayeck has so much charm, yet she always picks the wrong roles. 3. Mike Myers is the only thing good about this film. 4. A woman's voice in the preview says ""written and directed by Mark Christopher"", um he is nobody folks. Just a guy with a cool name. 5. The Wienstien's should have let Dimension Films(the crappier side of Miramax) release this one. Ouch it hurt. The characters are all boring, except for Mike Meyer's whose role took a back-seat position. Yargghh. Rent Boogie Nights instead, it's terrific. And has much more energetic camera work.",54

Ryan Phillippe is really charismatic, Salma Hayek is touching and Neve Campbell and Breckin Meyer are impressive in wasted roles. Still, it leaves u wanting more...",54

I doubt it. Ryan Phillippe gives THE worst performance of the year.  A Razzie should be in order here.  The best performances came from Mike Myers, in a nice change from type, and also Ellen Dow as the dope smoking old lady that dies towards the end of the film.  Ellen Dow is an underrated talent.  I thought she really shined in this film.  The film could have been so much more, but the editing was screwed up.  Overall, I give this film a B- because as crappy as it is, I still found it enteraining.",54

This movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted, but overall, this movie was a big waste of time. Instead, the movie to watch, that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.",54
73,LisA_siMp,Just Great!!,7,31 December 2000,"this movie is amazing, is great! the plot is very interesting, and the performances are really good. The movie is about the splendor and the imminent decadence (with the disco age) of the biggest and greatest exclusive night club called ""Studio 54"". And it´s also the story of a young boy (Ryan Phillippe, a great actor and also the cutest) and how make his dreams come true: be a member of the exclusive ""studio 54"".Anyway, I recommend this movie a lot.",54
74,ProfDave,Mike Myers' bang-on Steve Rubell is probably the only reason to rent this film.,6,2 March 1999,"I watch about 10 to 30 films a month, from mainstream to independent features, and what qualifies as a great film, to me, is its ability to capture my attention every time I watch it. In the film's defense, I didn't dislike it. Ryan Philippe was tolerable, as was most of the cast, including Neve Campbell. The best way to describe this film is unspectacular, as good an effort as it was. Myers, though, is the obvious jewel of this picture. Despite the mediocrity of this film, his performance was Oscar-caliber, and if anything, the Academy, not to mention The Hollywood Foreign Press, seriously underestimated his performance. His words could've been written a little better (Mark Christopher is to blame for that; don't blame Myers), but Myers delivered them with perfection. Myers, in my opinion, should take a hiatus from comedies and/or sequels to concentrate on dramatic performances, for he is very-well established, despite the mediocrity that surrounds him.",54
75,angel4l,A great movie .... very under-rated,10,22 July 2000,"This movie was great. Not only did it have a wonderful star studded cast, but it managed to make a well known story very origional. Ryan Phillipe in the lead role was brilliant not often have i seen him act up to his potential like he did in this movie (Movies he did that sucked: I know what you did last summer, Nowhere)Mike Meyers also stunned me showing is versitality in one of his few serious dramatic roles. Breckin Meyer was great (Big step up from Dancer TX Pop. 81) Selma Hayek was great. My only complaint was Neve Cambell, I just think she could have done better. Great Great movie!! A must see for those who are nostalgic, or those who want a glimpse of the era we barely missed.",54
76,BillZane,What went wrong?,4,13 December 1998,"This movie had the greatest elements - Hot young stars, a dazzling set, and the ability to pull some of the country's most fun disco hits.  Instead, the movie turned out bland and downright stomach-turning in sections.  The soundtracks, with two volumes out now, have yet to scrape together four songs worth listening to.",54
77,MatthewInSydney,Director's Cut review - an originally disappointing film reborn into something worthwhile,7,12 June 2015,"The studio executives who ruined the first release version of this film in 1998 have a lot to answer for, but the director has had the last word and proved he was right all along, with the new Director's Cut (which I saw at the Sydney Film Festival tonight), which is an ENTIRELY different and improved experience. From now on, I don't think there should be any reason for anyone to watch the original release version again, the improvement is that dramatic. The one aspect that may irritate some viewers is that a few of the 'new' scenes have slightly lower image & sound quality than the rest of the film, as they obviously weren't able to find perfect quality footage for every restored scene, and the editing between some scenes doesn't always feel entirely smooth. And some weaknesses in the film still remain - such as Ryan Philippe, who is a bit limp despite being more than pretty enough for the role. But in so many other ways this is a far far better film, taking a film I'd only have rated maybe a 4 in the past, to at least a 7 now. About 40% of the film feels entirely changed, all for the better. There's a lot more life to the nights at the club, now that they've been able to put back the sex & drugs the studio removed (no movie about 1980-era disco makes any sense once you remove them). The parties are wild and bisexual and very disco. And the whole direction of the drama has been altered, now that the dull studio-imposed romance with Neve Campbell has been removed. Neve is still there in a small role, but the film now focuses on Ryan's love triangle with Salma Hayek & Breckin Meyer instead, which is far more interesting. Everyone who worked on the film should be happy with the Director's Cut, which proves they were making something pretty decent (until the studio stuffed it up).",54
78,Scott-4,"A jumbled mess, but still worth seeing once.",7,23 January 1999,"I think we all agree there are so many plot and acting flaws here, that overall, the movie is a big bomb.  However, it is fun to watch at least once just to see the four lead actors in interesting and sexy roles.If you are concerned about moral content, steer clear of this movie.""If You Could Read My Mind"" by Gordon Lightfoot has always been one of my favorite songs.  I can't imagine him allowing them to make a disco version of it.  The chorus actually works pretty good as a dance tune.",54
79,shankar,dreaming with tears in my eyes,4,22 July 1999,"From what I understand, Studio 54 was a place of excitement, sex, music, drugs, money, crime, celebrity, and high energy.  Amazingly, this movie misses EVERY ONE of those things.  Sure, there's some sex and drugs, but it's extremely tame.  The energy of this film is completely nonexistent - as is the humor and the sleaze.  Imagine if a good director told this tale (like Martin Scorsese or someone)!  There's a killer movie here.  Also let me say that Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek are NOT a believable couple, in no way imaginable.  I gave it a 3, but only because Neve Campbell is beautiful, Salma Hayek is sexy, and Sela Ward is hot.  I added a point because Mike Meyers rules.  It's kind of nice not seeing him be so happily goofy as in Austin Powers or Waynes World.",54
80,uniqueabba,"Fun times, lewd times, fun all the way!",10,7 March 2007,"Loved this film, I was just a little late coming into the ""disco"" scene as it was called in 78, I was more into ABBA, but by the 80's ABBA was over and HI NRG music was my thing.This film is brilliant! Although I never attended Studio 54, there were equivalents in London, Heaven, The Roof Garden on a Sunday night, and The Hippodrome on a Monday night. This reminds me of those times.Decadence, drinking, excess, I never partook in drugs but I certainly drank champagne like it was water. I spent hundreds of pounds on a Sat, Sun and Mon night, I danced, and I had sex, sex, sex, anywhere and everywhere! Then AIDS rearer its head and it pretty much was over.AIDS is mentioned in ""54"", as are drugs and booze, it was all an excess in every extreme, a wonderful era, that had its casualties, me included, who went on to be an alcoholic.Now cured of alcohol, self restraint and will power got me through, I returned to London's club scene and the equivalents are here now today too, HardOn, an overt and open minded sex club in London, a monthly affair, where there is free love, gay sex in every corner, live sex shows, scary live acts where I saw one man ""branded"" with a scalpel, another man had his genitalia burned with a Bunsen burner while the crowd looked on unimpressed! Decandence returned to London, whether this level of debauchery will ever return to the newly cleaned up New York is another matter.Studio 54 brings back fond memories, great music tracks and a joie de vivre that now can still be found if you know where to look.Enjoyed immensely, I recommend this film to all open minded people out there! I so wish I was 20 again! Still, at 43 I am back out and doing much the same, just with the brakes on a little, so I can make it to 65! :-)",54
81,movieboy-6,"""boogie nights"" revisited",8,18 January 1999,"After having rented ""Boogie Nights"" and hating every painfully trashy minute of it, my expectations for the similar ""54"" were not high.  I am fascinated with the decade of the 70's and this movie portrayed it beautifully, much to my surprise.  Drugs, some pretty raunchy sex, and kickin' music really create the vintage feeling.  Salma Hayek absolutely stole the show as the fame-seeking coat-girl Anita, and Mike Myers was also very believable as 54 owner Steve Rubell.  Even though Ryan Phillippe could've been better, his wrong-turns are forgotten as Neve Campbell stinks up the screen.  Her performance as the soap-opera actress made me feel severely violated.  Even though I am a big fan of hers, I seriously think that she should stick to what she's good at:  portraying disturbingly neurotic people who scream a lot.  Even though Campbell's acting was nastier than Paula Cole's armpit hair, this is an overall great movie.  B+",54
82,donny-31,A Waste of 20 Minutes or so...,1,1 July 2005,"This film rivals ""Killer Fish"" as the worst film of all time. The only reason I watched it so long (about twenty minutes) was to see how bad it could get. OK, and the pretty pretties.I went to a lot of discos, and I went to them a lot, in the seventies. They were pretty great for me then; I loved the scene. I never went to one like 54, of course - so I can't say how the film measures up to the reality.I can only give my opinion on this film as a film, and that's my favorite Middle School Reviewer line: ""This Movie Sucks!""It is a celebration of debauchery and sleaze, which normally is my favorite, but it is very badly done. Ryan Phillippe is the epitome of the pretty face that can't act, and Mike Myers' ego precedes him by about six feet.Salma Hayek - oh my dear Frida, what were you thinking?",54
83,Stoney-9,The beautiful people...the beautiful...,5,8 April 1999,"Admittedly, I rented this movie to get a glimpse of Neve Campbell and Selma Hayek doing their stuff, and of course, I was disappointed.  While interesting from a sociological standpoint, this movie never really seemed to get going.  The narration that helped so much at the beginning mysteriously disappeared, and the only sense of closure was the death at the end.  This movie was pure eye candy, and not much of that.  I would have to agree also, with the other critics, that Neve Campbell is lucky if she didn't do her career a major disservice with this part.  She was stiff, which is partly due to the writing, but I saw nothing more than ""Party of Five"" with a somewhat better cast (although I'm not sure).  Enjoy the music  and the dance, because there ain't much more to this movie.",54
84,philstrachan,Awesome film! It's spot on!,9,5 November 2020,"If you watch documentaries on studio 54, you would see just how well made this film is historically, woven with some fictional characters. I love this film, have watched it many times.",54

Usually I'm against that kind of behaviour and always try to justify a film by it's other, more important contents. I found myself incapable of doing this with ""54"". This film is a big ""So What?"". No climax, no intrigue, no suspense, no drama, no exciting direction, no sex, no mood, no good. I wonder why this was made... Why? What was the intention? Is there a point? Did the characters evolve in any way? No. You're always waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does.

88,Jace007,Meyers Saves 54,6,8 January 2001,"This movie had alot of potential - but it failed to deliver. The focus on Phillippe's character seems to have dragged away the real story you wanted to see - the story of 54. Mike Meyers saves this movie with a surprisingly great dramatic performance. His character seemed to suit him(!). Ryan Phillippe seemed to be lost in his role, while Neve Campbell seemed real dis-interested. Salma Hayek done the best with the role she was given. While Sela Ward added that little extra something to keep the movie from falling to pieces. A movie worth watching as long as you don't expect too much from it.",54
89,Hubajube,Glitzy and entertaining,6,2 September 1998,"One of the best compliments I can make about an actor is to say that I forget who the actor is during the movie.  Mike Myers doesn't exude Mike Myers-ness in this movie.  This is him at his best.  Lots of exciting, entertaining, energetic scenes here.  The only parts that sagged were those extraneous ones with Neve Cambell.  (Come on, we don't need; a love interest every movie!) Oh yeah, the music was well chosen too.  Not too many of the overplayed disco hits, just lots of anonymous beats, the way it was meant to be.",54
90,jackieO,Disco infernal,7,1 February 1999,"All seven of my points go to Mike Meyers in his portrayal of Steve Rubell. So convincing it borders on frightening.

91,corway-2,Are you ready for disappointment?,3,20 August 2001,"54 is one of those films that has potential to be engaging and intoxicating, but that potential is never fulfilled.  The impression I got was that each storyline was intended to go somewhere, but was hacked up and edited out somewhere in the process.  There is no overall arc to the story, which gave it the feel of a 2-hr pilot for a prime time TV drama, in which case we would eventually find out more about the characters.The only character I was interested in was Mike Myers's.  Surprisingly, the owner of Studio 54 was relegated to a minor role in the story -- merely window dressing.  Instead of the film being about the club, its owner, and its patrons, it seems to be preoccupied with how gorgeous Ryan Phillippe is.With such a talented cast, it is a shame that they were wasted on a story and characters that go nowhere.",54
92,Pinupguy,Tedious Drama has a few nice touches.,5,4 September 1999,"I really wanted to like this film, mainly because Neve Campbell was in it, but I couldn't. This was long, episodic and boring. The script was unimaginative and the direction was uninspiring. The only impressive factors was the acting (especially by Mike Myers!) and the set design was spectacular. Though these can't make up for a shoddy script. Like most films, it was flawed from preproduction.",54
93,cswolfe,Mike Myers is magic.,6,7 July 1999,"Mike Myers is magic.  If only the rest of the film had even a tiny slice of that, but it doesn't.  Mike so deeply immerses himself in Steve Rubell's character that you would not recognize him if you did not otherwise know. Reports of Neve Campbell's vapid performance are grossly exaggerated ... er... uh ... wait; no they're not.  She's badly miscast, and demonstrates all the starpower of Disney wallpaper.  Would love to trash Ryan Phillippe as many have, but personally, I think he handed in a perfectly workman-like performance.  The film seems to believe that one note -- phony glamour -- will carry 90 minutes.  Bad misjudgment.",54
94,TC Smoot,Piece of garbage,2,13 September 1998,"I had semi-high hopes going into this movie.  I mean, it has my heart-throb Neve Campbell, the usually very funny Mike Myers, and that hot chick from Desperado.  When the final credits started to roll, I turned to the people I was with and raised my hands in a ""What the hell?"" sort of gesture and laughed.  This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have seen.  Ryan Phillipe has no charisma or screen presence as the lead character.  The dialogue is purely awful.  The only good thing about the film was Neve Campbell whose presence on the screen took my mind off of the actual film.  The ending to the movie fit everything perfectly:  It was AWFUL!!!  I'm going to warn everyone about this movie.",54
95,Jarod-10,Pretty good movie,7,29 April 1999,"When I went to this movie, I went with the feeling ""it probably is a movie kind a like Saturday Night Fever"". Well, I was pretty right. Most of the actors did a good job, but I thought Philippe (Shane) wasn't that great. Mike Myers, au contraire, played one of his best roles. The film gives a more than average view about studio 54. The film isn't as far as great as Boogie Nights, but that's because this is a slightly different movie. The best scenes of this movie were to me Steve Rubell rolling in his own money totally stoned and of the world (a very vulgar scene). The last scene where you see Steve Rubell on the stage looking over the dancing people and you can see in his eyes that the party was over, that was a great scene. My final remark, a pretty enjoyable movie!",54

However, considering how contrived and threadbare the whole script as we see in the movie, I doubt this could have been anything close to a great movie.The director seems to have assembled the worst cast possible, or at least made sure that most of them gave their worst performance possible.  Ryan Phillipe proved in this movie that he is nothing more than something nice to look at.  If your idea of a great actor is one who looks great in tight jeans or short shorts and a tight tank top (not that using acting ability would ever matter), he's perfect in the role.  His character is not a loveable one, but Phillipe doesn't even make us regard him in any matter.  He does not develop his character's thoughts or emotions.  He could have been a villian or some cocky bas**rd whom the audience loves to hate.  Yes, Phillipe was limited by a poor script, but I can't say he has ever excelled as an actor in any movie.Neve Campbell was also extremely dissappointing in her performance, in her battle with Phillipe for who could be the worst actor in the film.  Her performance is also uninvolved and bland.  She was better in the ""Scream"" movies and even ""Wild Things.""  She failed to show us why Phillipe's character would even possibly be infatuated with her.For the most part, the rest of the cast was also terrible.  Salma Hayek proved why I don't like her acting once again, and the stoner from ""Clueless"" was also rather bland.The ""dirty old lady"" bit is becoming too much of a bad Hollywood cliche these days.  I liked Ellen Dow's character the first time I saw it--in ""The Wedding Singer.""One great thing about ""54"" was Mike Myers' brilliant performance.  He really threw himself into the role, and proved that he, as a true actor, might be more gifted than we have previously given him credit.  He used the terrible script to his advantage, using the contrived, false dialogue to show the pathetic nature of his character.  I only hope that Peter Weir will cast him in a movie and do for him what he did for Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society) or Jim Carrey (The Truman Show).Perhaps if Mr. Christopher had the type of controll that Orson Welles had over ""Citizen Kane,"" he might have had a decent movie.  But to even mention the two in the same sentence seems sacrilege.",54

I found this movie technically stunning, with great locations and a cool recreation of the era. It's the plot that doesn't work on very well. It gets stuck in some points where Christopher could have done something else to develop. The movie is also some kind of waste -of -talent -that -should -have -looked -better -on -paper. Mike Myers does a great performance here, one of his best. Neve Campbell is also ok. But the one who should have stolen the movie is Salma Hayek. She is so beautiful that the only fact of seeing her on screen is a pleasure. Anyway, her character wasn't treated as it deserved. Doesn't matter........she's still appealing as always and very talented. My comment in just a few words: It could have been better, but is still a good one.",54

I mean, he looks good and does his best but it would have been much more thrilling if they would have done something like ""The Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager Story"" ( because after jail they also opened the legendary ""Palladium"" club in N.Y.)and show their point of view or ""The Andy Warhol Diaries"" which describe the decadence of the 70´s and 80´s explicitly.

I like his natural acting, his sincere voice and features. The acting of Mike Myers was also great, these are my favorite characters in the movie.This movie can really send you in the atmosphere of the early eighties, you can feel the passion and feelings of the characters.It makes you feel sorry that you've not visited this place, and that it doesn't exist any more. I recommend you that movie, if you still haven't got the chance of watching it.",54
107,swordfish_man,So underappreciated,7,7 February 2019,"This movie is a gem.
If you can get your hands on the Directors Cut, do it! It's brilliant, and you can see what the film was meant to be.
I made my own edit with the Directors cut, and I added all the additional Neve Campbell scenes they filmed for the theatrical version.All in all, I think it's a great look at what the 54 nightclub must have been like. But seriously, get the Directors cut.",54
108,AnotherCineFan,Looking Better A Decade Later,10,1 March 2007,"Ryan Phillippe shirtless shouldn't be illegal, as suggested by Mike Myers in his excellent portrayal of Steve Rubell - it should be REQUIRED - for any young man that looks as excellent as Phillippe did in this film. He spends most of it shirtless, and there really is no finer representation of young manhood. While Phillippe has gone on to demonstrate his acting ability in other films, we will never forget his perfect physique in this trendy film. The movie was never intended to be any better than the era and music it represents, but Ryan would be a treat at any time - at that age - if he removed his shirt. It's also important to note that Phillipe no longer looks like this - as hard as he tries, he'll never have that slender, obviously-muscled teenager's body again. Such is life.",54
109,DJ Bob,Needed just a bit more,7,1 September 1998,"At first I thought that we were in for a variation on ""Boogie Nights"" without the porn angle.  I was right.  However, I didn't feel as if the film knew quite where to go.Was it a look back?  A tribute?  A documentary?  Sadly, I didn't find myself feeling anything for these characters.  And considering the fairly short running time of ""54"" (approx. 1:35),  we weren't given a real chance to learn about all 4 main figures other than the fact that they were all outsiders just trying to fit in.  But, on reflection, maybe that was the point.The one thought that I had leaving the theater was this, ""Mike Myers has taken his talent to the next level.  Period.  He made me forget his years on SNL and thw Wayne's World flicks.  Myers portrayal of Steve Rubell was, in a word, inspired.  And a little disturbing at the same time. Congratulations Mike. Scale of 1-10: 7.",54
110,miralvr,"While getting slammed by critics, 54 offers fun, summer entertainment.",9,31 August 1998,"I enjoyed this film.  Yes, it got slammed by critics.  Yes, it's a little slack on details and some might consider it dull.  While even I hoped for a little more of life inside the club than it actually projected I still amazingly liked it.  Maybe, because it was incredibly short and light -weight summer entertainment or because it had a constant beat to it; either way I still enjoyed it.  I'm not recommending this, even though i liked it myself; because most people won't have interest in seeing a movie on 54 and especially after reading the terrible reviews about it.  The truth is Mike Myers was good as Steve Rubell and the rest give reasonably good performances;enough to believe at least.  This film was incredibly low on sex and drugs considering it was the late 70's in the notorious Studio 54. I was a little surprised that the film didn't ever show rubell's co-partner Ian Shroeger.  If you're expecting a strict copy of the real 54, this will probably disappoint you.  The main story line is featured on a young adult who rises as a bartender in the club and how his life changes in all aspects; his connection with his family deteriorates, his drug use rises along with his sexual activity.  But there is really hardly much sex in it too make it possibly offending.  I love how the beginning and the ending is portrayed.  The film was cut short 30 minutes after it was shown to a test audience-which disliked various parts and the ending i believe.  Whether it was cut for the good or the bad I give this film an 8 out of ten or a B+ or better yet, 3 stars out of 4.",54
111,nick-93,had potential,6,12 October 1998,This had the potential of being great but was ruined by Disneys cuts which made the movie unfocused and disengaging.  There was great potential for the love affair between Selma Hayek and Ryan Phillipe but it didn't go anywhere and the characters were just left there with nothing to do.  Mike Myers lit up the screen and is worth the price of admission.  The recreation of the nightclub interior is also impressive.,54
112,chapisimo,For the Director's cut only...,7,3 August 2021,"The director's cut is much more interesting, definitely.",54
113,Stadium_Hot,Poor Film,4,14 January 2007,"54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era. It features the classic good-looking bartender. The sexy females. The high powered owner. The partying. When all entwined together chaos ensues, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be at the brunt of it all.I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible, whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments (like, it's an 'ok' film). I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast. Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek, I am always awaiting to see her beauty, radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance, but, reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is. I mean, really, what has she ever bequeathed the masses with, other than her immense table dance in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting'. Mike Myers, isn't quite as bad as these 2, he does at least give the Film something worthy. Playing the seedy, extroverted co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that the majority watching would hate (i.e. job well done), he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick. But alas, it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness. Most 'bad' bad films I find something to take from the film, but this has nothing to it, really. Neve Campbell isn't too bad, but she is just 'there'. The storyline is dull, it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else. Any meaning. Any class. Anything at all. Because like most ornaments, they are just hollow pointless objects, that are merely pretty to look at, much akin to the basis of this disastrous film.Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting, like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather.",54
114,hallvard johnsen,"Promising idea, disappointing result",6,10 April 2002,"This film had all the ingredients needed, still it fails considerably. Its topic is comparable to Boogie Nights but whereas that films manages to use the music, fashion etc of the time (in addition to some remarkable characters) to create something truly spectacular, this film turns it all turns into a faceless background blur and does not manage to produce proper characters either (with the exception of Mike Myers). But the raw material is so promising that somebody should definitely make it all over with greater amounts of passion, humour and sensitivity.",54
115,Zippee,"This was an important era in the ""me"" generation and I don't think we saw enough.",4,9 September 1998,"I was disappointed by 54, the movie just retold the legend of the club as advertised. I was hoping the story would go deeper, especially in terms of the celebrities that enjoyed the limelight. Unfortunately part of the mystique of 54 can be found in the years after Steve Rubell went to prison, I would have recommended that the early 80's which lacked the glamour of the 70's be represented as well (if only for a footnote). This was an important era in the ""me"" generation and I don't think we saw enough. This is the first movie on the excess of the 70's that didn't really have a good soundtrack. I enjoyed Boogie Nights but found that a lot of the same material was re-hashed in 54. Mike Myers was amazing, Neve Campbell did the best that could be done as a throw-in role and I would have enjoyed more of Salma Hayek.",54
116,Fount,So disappointed..,2,11 October 1998,"This is the second worst, and most disappointing film I've seen this year. With such a great potential given the history of the club, it's well know patrons, and the endless possibility of storylines, the film is wasted on ficticious characters and their moronic, boring storylines. I knew the that the film was bad, when the only references to real people were those who were deceased (Steve Rubel, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote).  My guess that every person associated with the movie still living threatened to sue if the were portrayed. Forget this movie, and catch the ""Behind the Music"" documentary of Studio 54 on VH1.  It is much, much better.",54
117,joely-3,Mike Myers should have received that rumored Oscar nomination for this movie...,8,17 June 2000,"While the acting is pretty dull in this movie, Mike Myers proved that he can handle serious drama. Shortly after this movie came out, it was rumored that Mike Myers would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for playing the Studio 54 owner. I would have strongly agreed with this nomination, and I only recommend 54 to anyone curious about the serious side of Mike Myers.",54
118,Scud-5,54 Rules,9,7 September 1998,"This Movie was the Best... One of Mike Myers Best.. I would have to say it was one of his funniest movies ever. Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Breckin Meyer and Neve Campbell were great.. I love this movie.. a must see for all...",54
119,lachlan-4,"A bar tender gets lucky, so what?",6,23 January 1999,I thought this was an OK film. But what was the point of it? Surely Rubell IS the story not some jacked up wee bar tender. It would have been like the People Vs Larry Flynt from the view point of one of his strippers. A wasted opportunity...,54
120,mario_v-3,I like it,9,8 February 1999,"Actually, I like this movie. I liked the Ryan Phillippe performance, because i saw him in a more human role, than he has acted before.I liked Salma Hayek very much, because I can see that her acting is getting better, and more mature, so as Neve Campbell.I kind of dislike the Mike Myers performance, because i think it is a little exaggerated, and i liked Breckin Meyer who (although it is the first time I've seen him) he did a good job, as Sela Ward did too.",54
121,Wills,One Big Party Until You Come Down From The High,9,11 January 1999,"Studio 54 was a swift, colourful flick that showed us the true ins and outs of the seventies.  The only difference is that the writers remembered the seventies .. thus, they obviously didn't really live the seventies atmosphere to its fullest. Mr Ryan Phillippe, in my opinion, took on an enormous task in performing this role ... I mean who else could you get to wear tight clothing, push pills, make drinks, take sexual harassment from a male employer, and still look pretty?  Ms Campbell' purpose in this movie showed young girls that you can get somewhere with talent and not just looks.  Basically, the script was compelling, the acting was sought as half way and ended up getting three quarters ... so overall I say that this isn't that bad of a flick if you are looking for something out of the everyday norm.  I gave this movie a rating of a ""9"" because it is a personal favourite of mine, and the casting was one of the best combos, for my taste in movies.  - David Wills christian 11/01/99",54
122,JW-20,Mike Myers is masterful!,8,11 March 1999,"Have any of you seen Wayne's World or Austin Powers?  Did anyone know this guy was this good?  I sure didn't.  Myers' performance is truly Oscar worthy.  The movie all around was good, but at times loses you. If you are debating whether or not to watch it, I say yes.  It makes me wonder if he would've let me join the party.",54
123,Chris-565,very cool,10,18 June 1999,"Ryan Phillippe at his best, great Movie with fantastic atmosphere and superb Actors, a wonderful Mike Myers, too bad the sharpest sex & drugs scenes have been cut out by Miramax. All in all one of the best Movies I´ve ever seen!",54

125,larrquarius77,THE WHOLE MOVIE IS A MAJOR GOOF!!!!,4,16 June 2000,"Great Major Character: Mike Myers, So-so Supporting Characters.Yet, the writers and directors of this disappointing movie have unfortunately been smoking- I think it rhymes with ""coyote."" But anyway, with much better and higher paid supporting characters, better writers and directors, ""54"" could have been more interesting. It should've been more of a historical docudrama (Like: Summer of Sam), than a historical entertainment drama (Like: Boogie Nights). I think people would've taken this movie more seriously, if it didn't try so hard to be Boogie Nights, but be rather like ""Summer of Sam.""Also, when Neve Campbell made her cameo in this box office bomb, that's when the movie tasted sour, smelled horribly, and started to attract flies. She completely ruined the whole movie with her role, and instantly sent ""54"" to you know where!!!Plus, this movie's timeline, STANK!!! According to VH-1, Studio 54 was CLOSED on New Year's Eve 1979, and Steve Rubell didn't get arrested until February 1980. The disco did not close temporarily until November 1979. The movie should've been set in 1978, rather than 1979, in order for this motion picture to make sense.A Disappointing: *1/2(1 1/2 stars)",54

I don't want to think what Paul Thomas Anderson would have done with it. 90 Minutes are much too short , 150 would be great, with a long shoot to begin and one story for each charakter. It's seems too easy with just the Ryan Phillipe Story. They could have had a great epos of the 80s lifestyle. So, it's just a simple film.",54
