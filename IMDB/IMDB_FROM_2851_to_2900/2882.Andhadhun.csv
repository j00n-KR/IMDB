0,SnoopyStyle,what a premise,8,21 October 2020,"Blind pianist Akash gets run over by Sofie and her moped. He's more than alright. He's not actually blind. Old movie star Pramod Sinha invites him to play for his wife Simi as a surprise anniversary present. When he gets there, it's surprise and a half. He must maintain his fake blindness to stay alive.I love the premise. I really really love the premise. I also like most of the twists and turns. My only question is how the trio expected to get paid. It seems like a hard scheme to pull off and they would have to release Akash before they can get any money at all. It's unlikely that they would agree to it but I'm willing to let that go. With a premise like this, every turn needs to be clean and tight. That turn needs a little cleaning. I would also keep the reveal of Akash's blindness to a bit later in the movie. This is still a good twisty thriller.",Andhadhun
1,classicsoncall,"""What is life? It depends on the liver.""",9,27 January 2019,"For those contemplating watching this movie, don't be misled by the tag underneath the title here on IMDb, or the Storyline that describes the protagonist Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana) as a blind pianist. Even a lot of the reviews say he's a blind pianist, but it's not the case that he's blind until well into the story. But it's so easy to believe he's blind because the actor Khurrana is so skillful at portraying a character who can't see. In fact the first time it's revealed that he CAN see, the tenor of the picture turns from a fairly serious romantic drama into a hilariously outrageous story that you'll have trouble believing. Not that this would have any remote chance of happening in real life, but it's pulled off like it might be able to, and that's where the fun resides.For all of the story's twists and turns, I had a hard time trying to find a plot hole or flaw in the picture. You could point to one of the near final scenes in which Akash explains what happened when the doomed rabbit hit Simi's (Tabu) car window, because he WAS blind by then, but he would have learned of it in some manner, so I'm willing to concede a little on that point. Where I'm definitely at a disadvantage is in not having an Indian background, because in reading some of the other reviews, some nuance and perspective is laid out that definitely adheres to that nationality. But from where I'm coming from, this was one of the most uniquely creative stories I've ever seen, which is something hard to come by after watching and commenting on a few thousand movies.The best part of it all though has to be that very last second of the movie when Akash departs the French restaurant and leaves Sofie (Radhika Apte) to contemplate what might have been. Instinctively I had a feeling that his sight was restored, but it was the Keyser Söze manner in which it was revealed that proved the icing on the cake. I'm tempted to watch the movie all over again, but I know I'll never be as surprised again as I was the first time. If that sounds like a recommendation, take it for what it's worth and catch this movie.",Andhadhun
2,ThomasDrufke,Like a Soap Opera Directed by Quentin Tarantino,8,5 June 2019,"I'm honestly not even sure how to begin reviewing this movie. The best way I can describe it is a fantasy-mystery-black comedy-musical-adventure-epic. Does that sound like something absolutely ridiculously insane? Well it is. Andhadhun focuses on a *blind* pianist who *witnesses* a deadly crime and is forced to report it to authorities, and things go awry after several reveals/double crosses that lead to a third act so extravagantly convoluted that it's actually quite awesome. Am I being vague enough for you? This is like a soap opera, in the vein of Pulp Fiction, with a dash of La La Land & Seven Pounds, inspired by Fargo, and directed by Quentin Tarantino. If that doesn't sell you then I don't know what will. Seriously, just watch it.8.7/10",Andhadhun
3,westsideschl,Let's Hear it for the Rabbit,9,17 March 2019,"What the heck let's hear it for the rabbit, but pay attention to our one eyed appropriately blind rabbit. Our movie starts out w/a rabbit (animated, but somewhat realistic) w/an attitude munching away in a farmer's cabbage patch (sampling only the best parts from each head) which might seem odd for a Bollywood film, but the intrigue is only beginning. Good acting (Khurrana as blind pianist Akash), script, and murderous intrigue that keeps twisting to the end where you may have forgotten that rabbit.
Music: Some '70s, some contemporary. Khurrana learned to play piano for the movie, and sings one song.
Not typical Bollywood because the foundation to the script was taken from a French short film (14 min.) called ""L'accordeur"".",Andhadhun
4,nairtejas,Long Review: Andhadhun (6 Stars),6,6 October 2018,"Andhadhun (Indiscriminate) is the type of film that is made for perfect mass viewing. It can be enjoyed by anyone and everyone who has an interest in the arts and in the idea of big screen entertainment. A crime drama that pays homage to human follies, Sriram Raghavan's latest feature scores points in all the departments except it does not take into consideration the decreasing attention span of its viewers.It is almost impossible to believe in the characters in Andhadhun. Yet they are some of the most charismatic and natural ones that I have seen in Bollywood so far this year. Starting with Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana), a young and attractive but down and out piano player who cannot see in the eye (or so he claims), who finds himself not once, but twice in situations that he shouldn't have been in. Situations that make his life hell and his dream to fly to London a more distant one. And that also doubles the job of Simi (Tabu), a failed actress married to a popular and successful and 2x older film actor of the 70s. There are so many turns and twists - that generate 'laugh out loud' comedy on the way - it is an uphill task to follow Andhadhun even as Akash romances his cutie girlfriend (Radhika Apte) and Simi tries to cover up her mistakes through more mistakes with the help of the police. There are too many mysteries to solve and questions to answer in director Raghavan's twisted crime comedy, which it somewhat automatically does in the second half. If you have not grown restless by that time, that is.Andhadhun is a mess, which is why it is a great picturization of the dog eat dog world that we currently live in. Akash's predicament is relatable and so is Simi's because try as they might, they cannot easily get out of the mess without sacrificing anything, whether it's a pair of corneas or a life partner. At every corner, it becomes more and more interesting to watch the drama unfold, regardless of its artificial elements. The upbeat songs by Amit Trivedi and background score will prevent you from dozing off, but towards the second half, you are bound to stop and wonder: where will this end and when? The film puts you in a predicament that you probably recently were in while watching Abhinay Deo's black comedy, Blackmail (2018), where Irrfan Khan's character triggers a series of blackmails after he see his wife canoodling another guy. In comparison, Andhadhun is funnier and has one of Vivaldi's Four Seasons to back it up.The film is elevated by its musical support more than anything. Trivedi's 'Naina Da Kya Kasoor' and Raftaar's titular track are played early in the film to showcase the cheerfulness of human life. Akash's blindness is not a hindrance to him anymore to enjoy life. But it does become one thanks to his own artistic capability in the same department. The actors and their acting come second in Andhadhun, and it is actually surprising to see the same level of energy and talent in all the actors. Khurrana, Apte, Tabu all put up powerful performances and are majorly supported by Manav Vij, Anil Dhawan, Zakir Hussain, and Ashwini Kalsekar - all playing memorable characters. If I had to select the best performance out of them, I'd give the plaque to Tabu, who previously impressed me after a lot of years in Mukul Abhyankar's crime drama, Missing (2018). She just puts herself out there - bare, vulnerable, and looking like a fire - and then unleashes her acting prowess with that coarse voice of hers.Khurrana, on the other hand, has been consistently giving out hits, and is anticipating another one (Badhaai Ho) in a matter of weeks, which deservedly puts him among the most talented and bankable young actors of Bollywood. If you are following the Indian entertainment circle, Apte is everywhere. And there's a reason for that. Overall, director Raghavan - who is known to go full board with his projects - manages his cast and crew well, with only few shortcomings in the technical departments.Andhadhun briefly reminded me of the good old days of silent comedies where everything on the screen was extraordinarily entertaining majorly supported by the score. There's a scene at the start where Akash is playing the piano and two people in front of him are foolishly resorting to their basic instincts. Not a word is spoken in those 10 minutes and yet it is the perhaps the most memorable scene in the film. It's pure cinematic brilliance, which unfortunately fades away in the second half as you complete watching the film in labored breathing. TN.",Andhadhun
5,briancham1994,Impressive undertaking,9,18 July 2021,"This film was quite impressive, taking a deceptively simple premise and extending it for a lengthy runtime without ever getting stale. The acting of the protagonist, a seemingly blind pianist, was incredibly genuine and imparted great emotional stakes. The tension throughout the film is palpable as every character is caught up in schemes beyond their control and all struggle to survive. After a point, it becomes convoluted and far-fetched, and the ambiguity of the ending seemed oddly contrived, so I can't give it the perfect rating it might have deserved in better circumstances.",Andhadhun
6,Thanos_Alfie,The blind pianist...,7,28 February 2020,"""Andhadhun"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we follow the live of a blind pianist that changes after some mysterious events. He is obliged to report a crime that he should technically know nothing of and try tell the truth about everything and everyone.I have to say that ""Andhadhun"" was a good surprise for me because I didn't have high expectations from it and it was simply amazing. I enjoyed watching it because it has much of suspense and it was very interesting. The interpretations of Ayushmann Khurrana who played as Akash was simply excellent and Tabu who played as Simi was equally good.",Andhadhun
7,Fella_shibby,Chaotic n hilarious with an amazeballs ending.,9,10 October 2018,"I saw this in a theatre. Being a fan of the director's earlier movies, I was looking forward to it n I enjoyed it tremendously inspite having seen The Piano Tuner.I liked this more than the original.The screenplay is awesome. The writing team n the director did a fantastic job n successfully made the transition of a short film into a feature.The potential challenges of losing the heart of a short film while making it into a feature is always present but the makers of Andhadhun really succeeded in laying the foundation for future talents.Coming back to the film, it is chaotic, hilarious n very ntertaining.It is well paced and has funny situations as well as a black sense of humor.Watch out for that shady hospital scene man.The movie is well cast, with amusing performances by Ayushman n Tabu.The director did a superb job n was definitely having a little fun after the dark thriller Badlapur.The music at the murder scene will remind A Clockwork Orange.",Andhadhun
8,Kdosda_Hegen,One of the best thrillers of decade.,9,10 April 2020,"This movie was surprisingly good. It starts as a romantic comedy, but later turns into the most thrilling and suspense thriller you could imagine.

10,Amyth47,Super engaging comic-thrill ride from start to finish.,9,19 May 2019,My Rating : 9/10'Andhadhun' is a rollercoaster from the starting shots and it never lets up right til the end. Arguably Bollywood's best thriller to date I'm certainly a fan having watched it 3 times + and reading up all the fan theories regarding it's superbly-crafted open ending - has 'The Usual Suspects' vibes don't you think?The pacing is pitch-perfect and the twists and turns are unpredictable and laugh-out-loud funny.A creative narrative by an unreliable narrator but a super-talented filmmaker!Thumbs Up for Andhadhun and Sriram Raghavan!,Andhadhun
11,yoggwork,The design of the film's turning point is not unobtrusive,8,26 May 2019,"The design of the film's turning point is not unobtrusive, but it makes people feel the huge difference before and after. At the same time, the portrayal of the image of the male master is also very successful, with coherence and degeneration. However, many of the plots are superfluous, including a series of love mates with little girlfriends, all of which are rubbish. This character may be needed, but this episode is wasted too much. There are also a lot of similar shots of police wives, who don't see the connection with the main line, and can handle it more succinctly. There are also logical flaws. Can a bad woman handle the right door with her heart, but let her go?",Andhadhun
12,Xstal,Blind Leading the Blind...,8,27 October 2020,"If you're searching for something to blindside, blindfold and unsight you then this might just be just what you've been looking for. Full of right angles, u turns, contradictions and deception - occasionally requiring a few hops of faith to overcome some of the slightly incredulous events and scenarios, they're all forgivable, as the originality and unique nature of the story grabs your attention and signs seals and delivers a climax for you to work out and interpret with your own innervisions.",Andhadhun
13,ketgup83,Don't Miss It Any Cost !!! Highly Recommended,9,7 October 2018,"Johnny Gaddar was one the best who-done-it crime-thriller to ever made in Bollywood which was skillfully directed by Sriram Raghavan. With AndhaDhun, he has raised your expectations.AndhaDhun tells the story of a blind musician (Ayushmann Khurrana) who gets the opportunity to play for a wedding anniversary at a famous Bollywood's celebrity house. All hell break loose, when a murder takes place at the premises and he is the only witness to the event.Sriram Raghavan has come a long way in Bollywood right from the brilliantly made Johnny Gaddar, revenge thrillers like Badlapur and Ek Haseena Thi to the riveting AndhaDhun. The movie's beginning is the ending and every scene is linked to each other. Few scenes in in the first half will send the chill down your spine while second half consist of every member double-crossing thriller. Things become little messy towards the later part of the film as there were other stories involved as well but thankfully does not loses the steam. Hats off to Sriram Raghavan for keeping the audience on the edge of the seat. A big shout to the writers Arijit Biswas, Yogesh Chandekar, Sriram Raghavan and Pooja Ladha Surti for valuable story while dialogues are superb. Amit Trivedi's song are okay but his background score is good. Cinemtography is nice catching the essence of Pune city while art direction is simple.AndhaDhun belongs to Tabu and Ayushmann Khurrana - The two actors compliment each other and I loved every minute of their interaction. If you have liked Ayushmann Khurrana as a lover boy in his previous film, you will enjoy his performance as a blind musician. Tabu is just fabulous in the negative portrayal. Radhika Apte provides good support while Zaki Hussain is fun to watch. I liked Manav Vij as a corrupted cop and Ashwini Kalsekar as his wife.Overall, a perfect what-will-happen-next thriller to enjoy and break-away from the rom-com drama of Bollywood. Superb 4/5",Andhadhun
14,saptesh786,Too many twists !,4,25 March 2019,"Andhadhun is a suspense thriller from Bollywood. Perhaps director or story writer thinks that the continuously twists make a movie more attractive. But they are wrong here. After some time of successive twists story losing its importance and logic and eventually it goes like a kid's game. Here hero is not blind (?) or blind (?) but viewers must be blindfolded while seeing such foolish movie. When bollywood come from its nest and make meaningful movies with global standards? Keep mind at home and watch only for enjoy such movies. I was completely feeling cheated after seeing this movie. However, story was good and would have been made perfectly if director did some more work on story. Overall it is not recommend much.",Andhadhun
15,Peter_Young,"A slick, stylish and taut thriller that is highly captivating and artistically brilliant",9,26 January 2021,"Okay, wow, that was quite a film, and I have no doubt it will be watched in one breath by most viewers and will keep them all on the edge of their seat the whole time through, just like it kept me and my family. Andhadhun is first and foremost a wonderful story, and Sriram Raghavan, one of the most talented directors working in Hindi movies today, brilliantly translates it onto the screen, creating a stylish and highly taut thriller which is very slick and aesthetically appealing, but also very credible, involving and thought provoking. The narration style is excellent, and the plot is very unpredictable, with many plot twists popping up as the story unfolds. Technically, the film is very impressive - the camera work is stupendous, and the sound score is fantastic and never exaggerated. The characters are wonderfully etched out, and the acting matches it perfectly. The film obviously belongs to the two leads who are polar opposites in terms of morality and intentions, but they also greatly complement each other within the story. Ayushmann Khurrana is always highly likable and convincing, and in this film, he does a great job of adding depth into a character that could have easily become unidimensional. His Akash is real and flawed and not a stereotypical hero, and the way Khurrana plays Akash's changing states is so good that even knowing the truth, the viewers might be confused. And speaking of breaking stereotypes, who could be a better choice for the role of the merciless Simi if not the magnificently charismatic Tabu, who happens to be one of India's greatest actresses. Her portrayal is extraordinary, because while playing a bad, villainous archetype, she saves it from veering into caricature and creates a woman who is as evil and immoral as she is real and conflicted. She actually manages to make her character almost a comic one, and this is perhaps her most entertaining performance in this regard. These two make Andhadhun an incredible cinematic experience and what can I add more except just please go and watch this film if you still have yet to",Andhadhun
16,MuviFan73,"New (target audience) to specified genre, will love it.",6,7 October 2018,"I use to see a lot of movies which belonged to genre psychology, mystery, crime or thrill a few years ago after onset of adulthood. Today I term those movies as dark I don't prefer to watch such movies at least not on big screen. After watching the trailer I decided not to spend money on this one. Finally when I got a chance to watch it for free I was happy with my decision.Tone, Script & Story: There are critics which say by disclosing the plot they would ruin the movie experience of people who will be watching it later. I still would discuss few things. How could someone go along so easily with a crime scene if they were just experimenting? How the dialogues of the killed matched precisely for the witness? How could the witness not pay attention and consume the sweets. How come the plan, to take away ransom stand so weak? Didn't the faith in God handled arbitrarily?Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Direction was justified. Other factors were justified too. The cinematography doesn't demand much whatever is shown is justified. Music: Music is good, my favorite track is 'Naina da kya kasoor'. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: If you belong to audience who has not seen movies belonging to genre psychological, mystery, crime or thrill especially from the movies released in the west you will love it (a prediction from IMDb numbers).",Andhadhun
17,Jithindurden,Entertaining but expected more,7,6 December 2018,"A Coen Brothers black comedy twist on the French short film The Piano Tuner plays out exactly as I expected it to. Ayushman and Tabu tries to outshine each other with every other scene. While Tabu has a track record of doing such amazing roles, this must be the best performance of Ayushman who seems to be the actor currently selecting all the right projects. But honestly, all the reviews made me think this would be better than I think it would be and wanted to see what they are going to do that makes it better than the original short film, but that wasn't really the case.",Andhadhun
18,ronakkotian,An extraordinary and captivating thriller,10,18 June 2019,"Andhadhun was the biggest surprise for me in 2018.The director, Sriram Raghavan, known for his other films like Johnny Gaddaar and Badlapur has crafted an exquisite thriller like no other. The screenplay is terrific here as there are many twists and turns that take place over the course of the film enhancing the unpredictability of the plot. The constant switching of paths keeps the audience hooked and makes them ponder what will happen next.Ayushmann Khurrana gives a strong performance as the blind pianist, Akash, and has definitely made a great comeback in Bollywood. It was also great to see the likes of Radhika Apte, Anil Dhawan and Zakir Hussain. However the one who stole the show was Tabu. Her performance as the hateful and wretched Simi is the best she's been in years and deserves a lot of praise and awards.The cinematography is great as the look of Pune seems very realistic. The background score which is filled with a lot of piano playing is very interesting as the piano tune fits in with whatever is happening in the scene adding a dramatic effect.Overall, Andhadhun is one of the finest thrillers made in Bollywood. Its unpredictable plot and outstanding performances make the film one of the best in the year as it culminates in a thought provoking ending which is open to interpretation and confuse many.",Andhadhun
19,Azanspy,One of the best movie ever in Indian Cinema.,9,22 December 2018,Andhadhun is a pure art by Sriram Raghavan. The direction and screenplay is so brilliant.

20,andrewroy-04316,"A wild ride, once Andhadhun gets going it never stops",8,6 July 2020,"Andhadhun is totally crazy, but manages to be both thrilling and smart. The first half hour or so seem mundane enough, as we are introduced to an aspiring blind pianist and get an obvious romantic setup. Then we see something happen that changes the tone from a happy, light film to a crime thriller, and the film never stops one-upping itself in how crazy and twisted it can get until the final shot. It's impressive how well Raghavan keeps the story from feeling ridiculous. Yes, it is really over the top, but we really care about Akash and the cultural backdrop is set up well such that it is plausible enough and we're too locked in on the crazy stuff going on to worry too much. This isn't just a mindless twisty thriller, either - Akash is a great protagonist (and fantastically acted), Simi is great, and there is plenty of thematic depth. We see a picture of this place in India where people are ruthless and unashamed to do anything it takes to save themselves or make some money. There are many clear visual and scripted moments emphasizing sight and perception of sight as key themes, and the darkly comedic moments (such as the ending with the rabbit explaining the opening shot) work well. When all is done, it feels like a bit of sleight of hand - how did this insane plot get me so excited and invested? It's a gloriously fun ride, the director creatively plays with our perspective in understanding character decisions and motivations (especially Akash's sight), and it's exactly what I want a good thriller to be like.",Andhadhun

22,JakeBrinkman,Absolutely wild ride,7,9 October 2019,"Andhadhun's beginning made me think I was going to watch an emotional drama about a blind musician. Then a revelation made me expect an Indian ripoff of a particular spoiler trope. Then things took a 180 and dove straight into insanity. I can't really say more about the plot without spoilers, but holy cow that was a wild ride! It was crazy enough to be reminiscent of a Tarantino film, although I can imagine a handful of plot improvements that he would have made to the movie.Akash's actor was incredible in the lead role. He was absolutely perfect at acting blind, double meaning intended. Tabu was also very convincing in both her ruthless and her emotional scenes. This is also the first Indian film I've seen that has truly exceptional cinematography, and the musical score was perfectly designed for each scene (though a few of the songs with vocals had lyrics that were a little too on the nose). This is easily my favorite Indian film so far, and with a few minor plot and lyrical changes, it would probably be in my favorite movies of all time.",Andhadhun

26,Magow-Intermean,Great game Tabu,10,14 November 2018,"Sriram Raghavan is known for his knack of dishing out twisty neo-noir, and he lives up to his reputation with AndhaDhun - a dangerously wicked thriller with dollops of dark comedy. Very few filmmakers manage to crack this genre and Sriram is adept at it. His film smartly questions your faith in 'seeing is believing'.Honestly, blind protagonists make for scrumptious thrillers and Raghavan ensures he doesn't miss a beat either. Inspired by a French short film L'Accordeur or The Piano Tuner (2010) by Olivier Treiner, AndhaDhun is a nerve-racking tale of fear, deceit and crime, that keeps you on the edge of your seat as it teases your mind. A 'Scream' (Hollywood slasher) scene in particular, acts as a classic jump scare.Boasting of a brilliant screenplay and masterfully crafted narrative by Raghavan, the story's audacious characters and constant twists, keep you riveted. Atmospheric and moody, an underlying fear of what lies ahead grips your imagination.
While the first half is replete with a blend of palpitating tension, suspense and comedy in classic Raghavan style, the second half slumps a bit. The plot gets a tad chaotic and convoluted as opposed to its terrific build-up. The long-winded conversation between characters slackens the pace and eases out the tension a bit, which you don't expect at that point. However, a spectacular climax makes up for it.Ayushmann Khurrana in the lead role is a revelation. While he lends that effortless ease to every role he portrays, AndaDhun is the most definitive role of his career so far, that proves his versatility. Tabu is outstanding as always in a conflicted role that expects her to be erratic, vulnerable and deceitful. Sairat (Marathi blockbuster) actress Chaya Kadam and Ashwini Kalsekar leave an impact. Yesteryear actor Anil Dhawan makes a memorable appearance and Amit Trivedi's music gives an haunting edge to the film. The interesting background score adds as a perfect layer to the ongoing proceedings.Open to various interpretations and unpredictable from beginning to end, AndhaDhun is an engaging thriller that keeps you on your toes and leaves you guessing all the way.",Andhadhun
27,zzhhhqing,Highly recommended,10,30 May 2020,"Good to see! It's really a god reversal, goose bumps! The beginning and end of the movie and the last second shot of the male host really leave a lot of imagination! This is the best suspense movie I watched this year! Highly recommended 👍",Andhadhun
28,Puroo,The best Bollywood movie,10,5 April 2021,"I am a huge fan of Ayushmann Khurrana. And this is one movie that absolutely nails it on every front. The story, the acting, the plot twist, the character development, and most importantly, the ending.The story is set around Aakash, a man who is shown to be a blind pianist in the beginning of the movie. However after he meets Sophie, it's soon revealed in a surprising twist that he isn't blind after all. Every part of this movie is absolutely thrilling to watch, especially after that when he goes to Simi's house and sees her lover having murdered her husband. He has to keep calm and continue to pretend being blind even after all that, which as we can imagine is tough, to say the least.Afterwards when he leaves the house and immediately goes to the police station to report the murder, it turns out the cop, Manohar is the lover. And now he has to come up with an excuse about why he is in a police station immediately after Manohar had committed a murder. He takes his time to convince Manohar that he's blind, but fails to convince Simi. As a result she makes him blind for real. You can actually feel the tension in that scene.Afterwards he teams up with Murli and Sakhu, but they betray him and try to run away with Simi's money. They do get their comeuppance, but by then Aakash never sees them again. In the end when Aakash meets Sophie in London it seems kinda sad that Aakash has become blind, but then we get an immediate sense of joy when we see him knocking a can out of his way.I really hope in future we get to see more such movies. This movie is basically a message to tell us Bollywood isn't exactly hot garbage. If it wants not only can it make such good films, but people can actually even come to watch them. This movie absolutely deserved an Oscar and I see no reason why it wasn't even selected for it.",Andhadhun
29,msunando,Luscious and dark secrets,8,6 October 2018,"Andhadhun - Rarely do you get such finger licking, luscious and dark thrillers that leave you with a sense of contentment in the end. Andhadhun is Sriram Raghavan's chicken soup for the soul of those in the quest of slick, heady and gritty thrillers that you can draw your own conclusions from due to the intrinsic intelligence of the narrative. It is indeed a breath of fresh air providing respite from films on social issues and rom-coms. The backdrop is moody, lazy and noire - Ayushman Khurana plays a blind pianist with such gusto that is likely leave the viewer gobsmacked. Tabu laps up her latest in renditions of characters with many nuances, mostly dark, in a performance that is riveting.It's a thriller noire, so I shall stop here. Please go and enjoy Andhadhun as it's a must watch. The second half seems to be going somewhat awry in the beginning, but like I said earlier, the movie more than makes up with a crackling finale that leaves you with many conclusions to draw and each one seems plausible. 8 STARS!",Andhadhun
30,ssssgelojun,andhadhun,9,20 June 2020,"In one detail, as the doctor drove Akash and Simi to the airport, the crooked tree on the highway was shaped like a liver. When I first passed the tree, I went straight away and didn't stop; In Akash's story to Sophie, the car stops under a tree.So I think Akash's recollection is that he made it up when he saw the rabbit's head crutches, that Simi died of a liver transplant, and that Akash took the money for a cornea operation. Because when the waiter took the rabbit's head crutch and asked if it was his, he did not touch it, but directly said yes. In addition, he hit the jar away with the crutch at the end, which directly indicated that he was still pretending to be blind.And here I want to say that the psychological endurance of the men is really his mother strong, simi wearing a scary mask that part, my friends directly scared to my body.",Andhadhun
31,madbird-61243,Illogical plot,5,7 April 2019,"A logical plot is everything to me. But it is lacking in this movie. The series killing by a woman is simply incredible. The police does not have any doubt on the death of the old woman? She is a witness of another murder.The wife is so cruel a killer. Why she just blinds the eyes of male lead instead of killing him?I have no problem of understanding seeing Indian films before this one. But I find the present one hard to follow. Maybe I miss out something.Anyway, it does not worth a rating higher than 5.",Andhadhun

Ayushmann Khurrana, this guy is simply wonderful, the kind of cinema he is doing is simply brilliant and he is putting his skills beautifully into the characters. Similarly here in this movie Ayushmann Khurrana has performed exceedingly well, but then again its Indian Cinema, such good work movies will only be talk about in gatherings but numbers at box office will be low.

34,krational66,"Gone is the good, gone is the false.",8,20 May 2020,"Although according to the fact, the male master was not blind in the end, but in his own story, he was already blind.I saw many people saying that the male owner is not a good person. At first, he pretended to be blind to enjoy some special care for the blind. He said that he always chose to be silent. I think there is a little different view. I prefer the male character to be kind at first, just as his eyes saw at first.There are mainly the following points to prove the goodwill of the male host at the beginning:1 After the male host first came out from the female host 's house, he sat outside for a while and went to the police station to prepare for the police, but he had no choice but to meet the murderer sergeant, so he could only be silent. This is the choice most people would make. . If he is the kind of person who has nothing to do with himself, he will never go to the police station.2 At the funeral, the police officer asked the hostess if there was a third man present. He still wanted to catch the murderer, so he made an anonymous call to the police station and said the sergeant was the mistress of the hostess, but the police officer was only It was a prank and told the sheriff.3 After he witnessed the death of his neighbor 's wife, many people said that he remained silent, but he was only disappointed with the police station. There was a scene where the policeman said arbitrarily that the old lady was 81 years old and did n't stand up, so he I chose to go home in silence and called Sophie to tell her that there was an emergency. I think I would like to discuss countermeasures with her because he thinks Sophie is a very kind girl.Then, the hostess blinded him, and he called the only support Sophie, which was the reason why he first chose to remove contact lenses, but Sophie did not listen to him at all and accused him of being blind (when he was Really blind). After the hostess left, the neighbor's little boy looked at him, but he was scared away, and finally he sat at home in despair.Then, the sheriff came to his house and wanted to kill him. He was escaped by thrill, but he was hit by reselling organs. When he was about to be robbed of his kidneys, almost when he started to blacken, he really wanted to hurt others. when.So he planned to retaliate the mistress and the sheriff, but in fact at this time he did not hurt them very much, at least he did not want to kill anyone, but he was betrayed by the couple of car drivers, and from his later It can be seen from the conversation that he knows that the more vicious couple is the woman. The driver still has some kindness, but then, the driver died.Finally, the male host and the doctor sold the female host's liver (equivalent to killing the female host). He regained his light and went to London to have a decent work and life.He lost his kindness, just like the glass was broken, and then he had good luck.But perhaps he himself hoped that his original good intentions were still there, just like in his own story, he was still kind, and it was the blind rabbit who killed him instead.To add, some people said that the last song of the hero and the relationship with Sophie is very irritating. I feel that he likes not Sophie, but the original kindness of his own heart, but in the end, Sophie is not what he thought. That way.",Andhadhun
35,Tejas_Vinda_AITS,Simply Amazing n refreshing ..!!,8,5 October 2018,"Unpredictable from beginning to end, AndhaDhun is an engaging thriller that keeps you on your toes and leaves you guessing all the way. It is a thriller par excellence. Very rarely does Bollywood deliver a thriller that shocks and stuns you so well. Although the second half does drop but the impact is made and this would surely result in a good word of mouth. Recommended!...",Andhadhun
36,rahul000994,What is Life ? It All Depends On Liver !!!,10,17 June 2021,"ANDHADHUN is a sheer piece of masterpiece from Sriram Raghvan. Many people have tried to review, but, I think no one can correctly review this movie because of its open ending. The director has left the interpretation of the end scenes to the audiences, like, was Akash really blind ? If yes, then how he remembered the car accident scene so correctly ? Akash was seen talking in Marathi, the how he does not any friends in Pune ? Like this, there are many questions which are left open-ended.Movie starts with the voice of Ayushmann Khurrana saying ""Bahut Lambi Kahani hai...Coffee?"" This clearly shows that Akash is telling the story to Sophie (Radhika Apte). And then ""Andha hone ke problems toh sabko pata hain, faayede main batata hoon"". Akash, a blind pianist confides in us slowly. We almost seem quite taken in by the trust the character puts on us and just when we begin to settle in, we realize that all isn't what it seems. It is a nifty thriller where pretense and make belief get so dextrously intertwined that you are forced to keep second guessing yourself and the on screen proceedings.Ayushmann Khurrana is superbly brilliant in his role of Akash. Tabu like always, she is wonderful in her character of Simi and Radhika Apte, though having a short screen time was impactful. And, the story, screenplay is too gripping for a suspense based movie lover like me !!!Andhadhun builds anticipation and tension without relying on clichéd tropes like a loud background score or frenzied camerawork. Inspired by the French short film, ""The Piano Tuner"", Andhadhun takes only the kernel of the idea and it vibrates instead with ingenuity and a twist ricocheting off every few minutes. Whether Akash is genuinely blind is not the question - or, at the very least, not the most important of questions. The film plays with the idea of sight, as some people find themselves blindfolded, while others wear masks to try and emulate the sightless 'focus' of which Akash boasts. Who is blinder: the one who can't see or the one who chooses not to?",Andhadhun
37,Breumaster,Slightly Overrated,7,19 February 2020,"'Andhadhun' has a good story and uses a form of storytelling, that is know from other movies. After the beginning scene, the story is told to the end, which is the beginning scene. I wouldn't mind that, if it wasn't pretending that the movie has the same qualities as the movies that used this form of storytelling before.I like how the story flows and thecharacters, although it becomes too extreme in some scenes. At some of these points, the story becomes implausible. I did like the music over the whole movie, which was worthy composed. I would recommend it for for fans of indian movies.",Andhadhun
38,mohit_sinsniwal,Rabbit or Duck? Ending Explained,9,24 May 2019,"Many have reviewed Andhadhun and rated it highly and I am no different. I found it pretty damn entertaining myself. Following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. Hope you all like it.Watched Adhadhun again today. I never made a post about its ending the first time because I liked the Director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.However, when I watched it again today, I realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.Before I go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of Rabbit or Duck illusion. Google ""Rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.For decades now, the Rabbit or Duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. What you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. A lot of people look at Duck only, Some people see Rabbit only and some see both.Of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.However, the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that Raghavan has done here), that what if there is no illusion? But being used to the concept of illusion, we are forced to look for both Rabbit and the Duck.Andhadhun - There is no duck. It's only a rabbit.In the last scene of the movie, the waitress from the Restaurant comes outside and gives Ayushman his cane back. This Cane has a Rabbit at its handle (Raghavan starts his Rabbit/Duck illusion here)The movie begins with Ayushman's voice telling Radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai....Coffee? - It's a very long story...Coffee?"" (This line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know, that Ayushman is telling the story of his life to Radhika)But interestingly, the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when Ayushman and Doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to London and Radhika says - ""Aur phir? (and then?)""This is sort of the writer's way of writing an Epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". In the Epilogue story, where Ayushman tells the story of Tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the Rabbit. 1- Tabu (who was distracted) and 2- Rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...Even Ayushman won't know because he was blind. So very clearly, Raghavan tells you that Ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.Now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told Ayushmaan (blah, blah) - but I am basing my explanation on what is shown. Not on, what is not shown and is pure conjecture.Here is one more thing - Tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of Info which Radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one, but she seems to get all this info first hand from Ayushman, completely oblivious of Tabu's whereabouts until that moment.So Raghavan very cleverly tells the truth, but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense, that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.Raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having Ayushman's cane with a Rabbit(or duck) handle, clearly saying- that Ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of Rabbit but he is telling that in his story.It is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.Adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means, something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - Exactly what the ending is.Fantastic!",Andhadhun
39,jkt2006,Awesome thriller!!,8,22 December 2018,Loved since the first 5 minutes. I was completely connected with the characters and actually began to watch things as they unfold from the main character's vision or rather perspective in this case. The movie begins to unfold after a calm first 15 minutes and then it's a roller coaster thrill ride for the protagonist as well as the viewer. Shows the power of a great story with a well written script with great performances by Ayushman and Tabu. Sriram the director and story writer excels once again!! I love his kind of thrillers. Can't wait enough for his next one.,Andhadhun
40,yogeshevolution,Twist and turns,8,23 October 2018,Andhadhun is brilliant movie.

41,AnishMisra,Andhadhun Review,9,6 October 2018,"Andhadhun is a film co-written and directed by Sriram Raghavan. Having watched the trailer, I was intrigued as the trailer didn't offer much (which is basically what we want from any trailer). After having seeing the film today, I finally can say that this film will go down as one of the best thrillers Bollywood has to offer.Plot: Life turns upside down for Akash, a blind pianist when he meets Simi Sinha, the wife of the 70's superstar Pramod Sinha.Story and direction: The film is inspired from a French short film. Having reading the plot of the short I can definitely say that this film is purely original and made to suit the Indian audiences. Sriram Raghavan and his team of writers have developed a very intriguing and funny plot enough to glue me to my seat. I was literally biting my nails in each minute as the film progressed as I could not guess what is about to happen in the coming minutes of the film. The characters are very well designed and are apt for the setting and the story. We have the two lead Akash and Simi who are polar opposites to each other in terms of characterization. Also, we have Pramod Sinha who was very well characterized as the self-obsessed superstar. Some of the supporting characters like Sophie, Swami, Maushi and Manohar were well justified. The cinematography and editing are top notch. Never for a moment the film went dull or rather I felt bored. The only little issue that I felt the film had was explanation. Some scenes were just left for the audience's imagination. Sometimes I do like that. But when too many things are left unexplained, I feel sad.Performances: This film is filled with praiseworthy performances. Ayushmann Khurrana was excellent and splendid. He performed excellently as the blind pianist. Tabu, on the other hand, was ferocious and selfish and was a match for Ayushmann's character. Many people have complained of Radhika Apte not been given much screen time. I didn't feel that and her performance was good. Manav Vij and Ashwini Kalsekar were great. Zakir Hussain and Chhaya Kadam were some of the other diamonds in this necklace. Finally, Anil Dhawan portrayed Pramod Sinha in the best way possible.Music: Each track in the film was suited to the situation and was awesome. Amit Trivedi did it yet again. If I had to pick out one track, it would be 'Woh Ladki' sung by Arijit Singh (After all, who doesn't like Arijit). Daniel B. George has done an excellent work in terms of the background score.Favorite Scene: There were so many of them but if I had to pick one it would be the first meeting between Simi and Akash. I will not spoil anything, but the balance between the tension and laughter was very well balanced in that scene.Verdict: Bollywood has given us many great films this year and Andhadhun is one of them. I felt like clapping my hands after the film finished. I was happy and satisfied after watching the film. Filled with great performances and an awesome story, I recommend this film to everyone who loves thriller. I am sure you won't be disappointed.I am going with a 9/10.",Andhadhun
42,calspers,Badly skewed by Indian user ratings - immensely bad cinema.,2,30 April 2019,"I really think it is time for IMDb to improve their rating algorithm and start to to take into account the demographic diversity (or lack thereof), which can vastly skew the average rating of a film. I find this to be a very prevalent issue particularly surrounding Bollywood cinema and their loyal domestic voters.So-called ""films"" such as ""Andhadhun"" (other examples include ""Drishyam"" and ""Airlift"") are provocatively bad by Western standards. Not only are they without substance or morale formed through hideous scripts, they lack humanity, and by this I mean in a dualistic sense, as neither good or bad are portrayed anything vaguely close to authentic.Performances are bad to mediocre at best, and so is direction and cinematography.Apart from these basics features, also ""Andhadhun"" is a horribly banale film without any real quality, and which by no means deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 alongside masterpieces such as ""Ikiru"", ""Persona"" or ""M"".Pure film hypocrisy and blasphemy that anyone from outside Eastern film tradition will badly regret seeing.

A MUST WATCH !!,9,27 October 2019,"A blind pianist seeking artistic excellence..A yesteryear film hero who could never make it big it then or now..His much younger, beautiful wife who is happy with the wealthy lifestyle he provides, but, not entirely satisfied..Her secret paramour who happens to be a cop ..Into this mix, throw in a murder by accident, a planned murder made to look like an accident, a doctor who runs a dirty clinic harvesting organs from unsuspecting victims and a few more greedy characters who seek to profit from the opportunities that fate presents them ..Voila..We have the perfect recipe for a classic thriller and in the hands of a master auteur like director Sriram Raghavan (Ek Hasina Thi, Johnny Gaddaar, Badlapur, etc.) all these disparate pieces come together like a jigsaw puzzle coming into coherence - piece by carefully, assembled piece. Raghavan proves his mastery through a meticulously crafted narrative that is equal parts enchanting and ensnaring as it unfolds in one delicious twist after another which dangle us on tenterhooks. We are constantly surprised as the director and his talented team of co-writers play multiple tricks with our expectations as repeatedly, they make us believe in something only to pull the rug from under our feet in one swift motion.True to its title, the movie plays like a blind symphony that enthralls with its sweep through a roller-coaster ride. Even the spurts of violence have a natural flow to them which appears lifelike without being overly dramatic, yet never failing to deliver the intended impact.Tabu is on top of her game and is having a ball as the volatile and chameleonic Simi while Ayushmann Khurrana hits all the right notes - in more ways than one - be it, deception or desperation - as Akash. He seems to have an enviable penchant to pick the right projects (Vicky Donor, Dum Lagaake Haisha, Bareilly ki Barfi, Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan and even the recent Badhaai Ho) that suit his strengths and which do well commercially, despite breaking some new ground from the much trodden path of regular commercial fare churned out by Bollywood. The rest of the supporting cast including Radhika Apte in a minor cameo, Anil Dhawan, Manav Vij, Ashwini Kalsekar and others including a pet cat have a purposeful presence and complement the leads effectively to bring the plot together.Overall, this is an engrossing thriller that keeps you guessing and second guessing and entertains with dollops of dark humour even as it explores the dark side of almost every character that walks through its plot.This is, by far, the best movie of the year and the entire team deserve kudos for their efforts.",Andhadhun

Like an explosion, everything went into hyper-motion, and I was engrossed.Ayushmann Khurrana was wonderful. Arguably, this was his best role so far and he did complete justice to it. I loved his nuanced portrayal of a man who walks into a messy situation. Every few minutes I exclaimed out loud, ""This guy is a great actor."" Tabu was fantastic in her role too. The way she carried herself through the film was a testament to her talent. She has always been incredible but sadly her talents were not better-used in other films. I wish Radhika Apte had more to do in this film but she also did a good job with her role. The supporting cast was good too but Tabu and Ayushmann definitely stole the show.The story-line was gripping and sucked me in. Every frame was interesting and there wasn't a single wasted moment.

Wont reveal too much ,even though there is not much of a suspense in the movie as to who the killer is. The real thrill is in the way that the movie moves ahead , literally in an Andhadhun manner , keeping viewers guessing.The first half is pretty laid back and has a few laughter invoking scenes and a bit of romance between Akash( Ayshman) and his girlfriend Sofie ( Radhika Apte).
The narrative however picks up towards the end of the first half when the first murder takes place and from then on , as the body count increases ,the twists and turns happening by the minute are enough to keep the viewer glued to his seat. 
The movie shows the dark shades of human character which we don't get to see too often in Bollywood. The characters are a complex bunch with grey shades to each and every one of them.
The climax scene literally pulls the rug under your feet and keeps you thinking "" abe yaar , yeh kaise ho gaya"" !!Cast and Direction: 
Kudos to the director Sriram Raghawan for his awesome direction in Andhadhun after giving us movies like Johnney Gaddar , Badlapur etc.
 
Coming to the cast , this is an out-and-out Tabu & Ayushman film with the whole movie revolving around them. Tabu, showcasing the role of a manipulative vixen without a conscience really speaks volumes of her acting prowess . After regaling us with stellar performances in Drishyam and Maqbool ,she comes up with another winner for us. Ayushman is equally awesome and essays the role of the blind pianist with a mysterious past perfectly.
Radhika Apte does a decent job but unfortunately the role is too small for her to make an impact. Rest of the cast including Anil Dhawan do a decent job.The music is nice , particularly the song ""naina da kasoor"" is hummable and has a catchy tune .Verdict:
A winner for sure, the director deserves a special mention for choosing such a subject and delivering impeccably. This movie packs a punch and is one of the surprise packages this year. A must watch film.9 out of 10 from me for this dark yet highly enjoyable film.",Andhadhun

The story revolves around an aspiring young blind artist who got mixed up with a murder conspiracy. The film is loaded with twists and turns that it is almost impossible to mention anything without giving away spoilers.
The comedy works perfectly whole throughout the movie and will make you thrilled even after the post credits.
Andhadhun delivers the impeccable performances of Ayushmann Khurana & Tabu. Amit Trivedi continues his form with much more blended soundtrack and songs which will keep you glued and plays a crucial part in the movie. Brilliant and well scripted dialogues, brilliant performances by all the actors, cinematography, fast paced narration, stunning execution makes this movie a great one in the recent times.Andhadhun leaves you with a mind full of questions which will make you think even after several days.Andhadhun can be claimed as the WoW movie of the year without any doubt.",Andhadhun
66,sarathpillaijl,Short review,8,22 February 2019,"Now this was a masterpiece. The bgm just blends with the screenplay perfectly.
Every scene was planned perfectly. The storyline was wonderful. Will definitely keep you pinned in. The cast was yet another plus point.
Overall very good movie",Andhadhun
67,omkar1984,Welcome revival attempt for Bollywood,6,11 April 2019,"A good revival attempt by Sriram Raghavan after 'Ek Hasina Thi' and 'Johnny Gaddar'. The core strength of the movie is it's pace which causes the viewers to overlook the hints that are key to the climax. The linear plot and several twists in the story engross the viewer. Like the typical Hollywood thrillers, the climax is left open to interpretations. As opposed to the public opinion, I don't think that Tabu, Khurana and any other actors have performed spectacularly but that's the beauty of the direction - the flow itself is simple and doesn't demand any compelling performances. There are several shortcomings as well, the characters of Sophie, Inspector Manohar and his wife seem unnecessary. I couldn't believe that a senior inspector is/was so docile and dumb! I am fan of Amit Trivedi but he and the others have failed to be even noticeable. IMHO, it's more of a comic suspense drama rather than a nail-biting thriller. Definitely a good watch, given the ever-dwindling quality output of the Bollywood cinema.",Andhadhun
68,IreneWatsonC,Blind,8,21 March 2020,"Excitement and chills are exactly where they should be in this movie of blind men.

69,g_aparna,When the 12 eggs go elsewhere...hell breaks lose!,6,7 October 2018,"Andhadhun
Film tells us a lot about the society and things that go on around us! They are as follows:
What is the usual ulterior motive of a young female to marry someone double her age?
Aged males should try to age more gracefully and not drool at girls as young as their grand daughters! They are mocked by majority and will surely be betrayed by the opportunist young female who lures such dullards by behaving sassily with them.
Beware of celebrity husbands! They can bore you to death by their constant need of appreciation and accolade! 
You can be a doting wife...but if your husband finds a sexier, sassier female with zero scruples to screw around with - he will jump for it.
Possessive doting wives can be very dangerous if they find out their husband's infidelity....
Don't expect any compassion from poor people who have been brought up in dire poverty - give a fraction of a chance, they will readily kill you for some money.
Even if you decide to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to your surroundings....you will still be dragged into all the nonsense that is going on around you!
What is the usual ulterior motive of a young female to marry someone double her age?
Money of course. You will never hear a young female falling for a retired clerk drawing a measly pension ! It is always some rich, esp. celebrity kind of creepy male who wants to show around that his libido is still intact and females as young as his grand daughters are attracted towards him! Clever females from greedy and shameless family backgrounds trap such dull males and feed their ego..and pretend to be very happy with them. Obviously no young girl in her senses will like some ramshackle toothless bloke jumping on bed with her - after consuming Viagra - so what they do is, they keep some young virile gigolos to take care of her sexual needs! So money comes from the old hag and fun comes from the gigolo! Wow womania....this is celebrated among greedy pig families !
Well folks, honestly I do not want to elaborate on the other points I have written - since the movie got released just day before yesterday...I can't reveal the end - nor the plot....better go and watch the film...it is a hilarious thriller! Enjoy.",Andhadhun
70,grybop,"So bad, it's good",4,5 January 2021,"Outrageously bad movie, that somehow ends up entertaining because of the multiple plot twists.Directed imaginatively, action kept at a fairly good pace, Andhadhun is basically an unintentional comedy, mostly because of how seriously the over-the-top, ridiculous, needlessly convoluted plot has been taken by everyone involved. Which is a shame, because it's a movie with rather high production values.If you're looking for a good crime film, avoid.
If you're looking for yet another IMDB-overrated Indian trainwreck to laugh at, see this.",Andhadhun
71,jcarlos-96740,Remarkably made,9,31 July 2021,"So the whole movie it's the main character telling the story of his life to Sofie.We know that everything until the moment Sofie finds him in bed with Simi is truth because she is the one he's telling the story too so he couldn't just make that up. So we now for sure that: he was faking to be blind, he and Sofie had a thing, Sofie found him and Simi together.At this point is important to keep in mind that he probably would like to tell Sofie a story that would make her empathize with him and justify the fact that now he really is blind and also justify his disappearance.The discussion here is about the ending he tells Sofie. If he was blind at the time there was no way he could've known about the rabbit because he couldn't see. So here is where the main hole is because this could represent that he lied about a lot of things to make a more interesting story or he only lied about the end because the real one wouldn't be nice to tell.What I think that really happened is that he took the doctor deal and took Simi eyes and liver and splat the money with the doctor. We know that he is not blind anymore because of the ending scene where he was aware of the can on the floor. How did he fixed his eyes? Where did he get the money to went to Europe? He said that a friend helped him but in a prior scene he said to Mavashi that he didn't had any friends or family when she asked if he wanted to call anyone. So how does a blind guy, injured, alone in a road, ends up in Europe with his eyes fixed again? He took that money and changed the end to make him look better.It's important to remember that the movie opens with the phrase ""What is life? It depends on liver"" that later is told by the doctor in the climax of the movie. This phrase has two meanings because it could be refereed to a person who lives or with a body organ.The fun part is that this is just my analysis, everyone can have different views and conclusions because the director allows that space to speculate and discuss.Simply brilliant and one of the best Bollywood movies ever made.",Andhadhun

73,rupak_speaking,It Keeps You Guessing,7,8 June 2020,"Twist after twist after twist, Andhadhun keeps you guessing all through right uptill it's apparent open ended climax. Yet another feather added to Ayushman's growing versatility as an actor, Radhika Apte is such a natural though she had little to do in this particular film, Tabu keeps on doing justice to her acting prowess right from the days of Namesake, RGV's favourite Zakir Hussain in the role of the doctor or Chhaya Kadam, every part played to near perfection. Much applaud has been rightfully showered on this biggest Bollywood hit of 2018, but what I didn't miss was the tribute to piano use in Bollywood featuring all the clips of our greatest actors and actresses playing this wonderful instrument throughout Hindi film history in the end roll credits. 7.5/10",Andhadhun
74,titonsahashuvo,Not as expected!,7,10 May 2019,"I have expected something better. But alas! Unnecessary killings, poor ending & the thing that confused me a lot is the character played Ayushman. Sometimes, he is seen so much talented & cool headed even in seeing that murder, blood etc. Sometimes he is seen to be so much foolis. But oveall not so bad. The scenes coming one after another were really unpredictable. But, it might be better.",Andhadhun
75,faroukgulsara,Are we blinded?,9,2 May 2020,"The movie starts with an empirical question ""What is life? It all depends on the liver."" At one look, it looked like an awkwardly constructed question. It may appear like it is grammatically incorrect. Or perhaps it could refer to how much one could hold his drink dependent on the neutralising effect of his liver. Maybe, it could refer to a time in Mankind's history when he was wondering where consciousness was situated. Some thought it was the brain while others placed it in the heart. Islamic philosophers gave credence to the liver for what we are. We are what we eat, and the liver plays a pivotal role in our digestion.As it turned out, it was none of the above. In the context of this movie, it referred to the illegal organ harvesting trade! This is the gist for its viewers - a film full of double speaks. In fact, the title also could denote the blind rage that one experiences at the height of anger.Andhadhun is based on a French short film, L'Accordeur (The Piano Tuner).A blind pianist, Akash, with a sob story of how he was hit by a cricket ball which damaged his optic nerves. He goes by doing small gigs playing his music and has big plans to go off to the UK. He befriends a motorcyclist, Sophie, who almost knocks him down. The real truth is that he is not blind, and he is doing it for sympathy or for a social experiment, as he calls it.
Everything was going on fine. He had his cake and ate it. He had a beautiful girlfriend in Sophie, earned large tips, and everyone enjoyed his music. Until...He came in to perform for a client's wife, Simi, to surprise her on her birthday, only to find the client sprawling in blood out cold, dead. The client apparently caught his wife in bed with her lover, and he ended up dead. Akash continued acting blind despite everything happening under his nose, the dead body being bundled by the lover etcetera.
The next day, he went to the local police station to report the murder. To his bewilderment, the lover turned out to be a police officer. Suspicious of Akash's movement, so started a cat and mouse chase -Simi and her lover hunting down Akash, Simi actually blinding him, Akash getting caught with a crooked doctor and his assistants who are keen to harvest his organ and a devious plan to outwit Simi of her money. The twist at the end of the movie where the ending of the story is left to everybody's imagination as Akash stays alive to narrate his life story to Sophie two years later in Europe.As Akash walks away after telling Sophie about his life adventures, the audience realises that Akash is seen voluntarily hitting a crushed can. That is when we wonder, 'Hey, what is real and what is fake anymore?' Interesting storytelling.",Andhadhun

83,ShitizSays,Calling it best film of the year will be an underrated statement,10,3 August 2019,"There was literally no expectation when I went to see this film.I went alone because there was no hype and no one around me was particularly interested in watching the film.I have no idea why the film attracted me because I rarely go and see a film on the first day.I loved the film at the first go. I was literally dancing with joy after watching this film. It is surprising what a good film can do to you.Lately my film experiences of Indian films had been so bad that my faith in good Indian films had lifted up.There was has been no story in any film, especially of Salman Khan's.This film was, however, different.The opening of the film starts with a farmer trying to kill a blind rabbit and we don't know what it is because the rabbit story doesn't end and we move to the city.The character establishments happen for 15 minutes in which we are introduced to every major character.The director doesn't waste any time in introducing characters and never get into details of their history or try to explain why they are doing what they are doing.The characters are as normal as we are.Radhika Apte looks gorgeous as a change because till now she had been given character roles only and for the first time I think she did a glam role. You will fall in love with her after watching the film.After fifteen minutes, the story starts to change and the real nature of people start to come out.Every character in the film has dubious character and every main character has a secret to hide and protecting that secret becomes the story of the film.The director lets everything go haywire by the time interval comes and you wonder what will happen next but then he starts rearranging them back.First half is very believable, but it is the second half the becomes too filmy.I didn't like the second half that much but then the director plays a game with audience, it ends the film on a very high note.The film ends with a scene that just blows you away and makes you rethink about everything you have seen. (of course not telling you that here)This is a gem of a film and films like this comes once in a while.The film is inspired by a short film about a blind piano player and it is duly given its credit in the end.I saw the short film to know how much of it is copied and realized that only the basic idea was lifted and the entire film was later woven around it.This film is as original as it can be.There is no reason why you should miss one of the best films of Indian cinema.",Andhadhun

95,ashwinrajan-175-992599,A murder story followed by a series of blackmailing events ending in a puzzle,9,16 August 2020,"This story starts off with a blind pianist composing a series of melodious tunes at his place. In actuality, the pianist happens to act blind to stay focused on composing melodious tunes. One fine day, as he was crossing the road, he gets hit by a scooter and the girl riding the scooter apologizes to him and takes him to a diner for a decent meal. Soon she learns of his passion for music and offers him a chance to play piano in a restaurant run by her uncle. A romantic relationship also develops between the pianist and the girl. On one instance, the pianist gets appreciated for the musical score played by him at an evening function and the millionaire rewards him. The millionaire also gives him his address asking him to play piano at his apartment. The pianist goes to the millionaire's apartment finding his wife opening the door. She allows him in and asks him to wait for a while for her husband's return. To his utter shock, the pianist finds blood stains on the floor also he notices unusual behavior from the wife. The pianist asks the wife to direct him to the washroom. In the washroom he finds a stranger hiding in the corner with a pistol in hand. The pianist uses his blind cover to stay unaware of the proceedings and goes on to play the piano. The wife and the stranger clean up the murder scene and gets rid of the body which happens to be that of the millionaire's. After a while, the pianist completes playing the score and takes leave of the wife. He rushes to the police station and before he could report anything, he sees the stranger, who happens to be the inspector at that police station. The pianist instead gives complaint of a missing cat that he lost at his premise. The inspector develops doubt on the pianist and accompanies the pianist home. He searches the pianist's place and leaves once the cat shows up. In the meantime, the death of the millionaire goes to the media and the police questions everyone involved at the time of the millionaire's murder. The wife gives a false statement and the inspector covers up the murder for a suicide case. But one of the neighbors who happened to see the inspector on the day of murder promises to give witness if she sees him again. The wife realizes the trouble that the neighbor might cause and silently kills the neighbor by pushing her off the apartment. The pianist happens to come there at that time as he was called earlier by the millionaire's daughter to teach her piano. He acts as if he had not witnessed anything, but the wife begins to suspect the pianist as to whether he is really blind. She follows the pianist after the class and arrives at the pianist's place. She offers the pianist some sweets that were prepared on the millionaire's death ceremony. The pianist eats the sweet and begins to lose consciousness. The wife had mixed some poison in the sweet and after eating the poisoned sweet, the pianist loses his sight permanently. The wife also makes it look like the pianist had been having an affair with her leading to the girl believing that he really is cheating on her. The girl leaves the pianist in a fit of rage and realizes that the pianist had been pretending to be blind all the time. But now the pianist who is actually blind begins to lose awareness of everything around him and stutters getting to things around him. The wife narrates her incident to the inspector who instructs her to have got rid of him permanently. The wife refuses to do the act herself and instead tells the inspector to get it done. That night the inspector sneaks into the pianist's place and tries to choke him with a wire and in turn make it look like a suicide, the pianist escapes the attempted murder by bludgeoning the inspector on the head with an iron box and runs away to the streets. He bangs himself against the lamp post and falls down unconscious. The inspector loses trail of the pianist and leaves the place. The pianist gets taken to the clinic by a rickshaw driver and his wife. The doctor assures the pianist that he will be treated by an ophthalmologist that evening and advises him to take rest. The doctor plots with the rickshaw driver and his wife to surgically remove the pianist's kidneys and in turn sell them for a large price. The pianist assures them that they would be getting an even larger sum of money if they listened to him. He tells them that by abducting the millionaire's wife, they could demand a hefty ransom from her daughter. Thus, the four of them plot a kidnap plan where the pianist would lead the millionaire's wife to a secluded location, where they can abduct her easily. They carry out the plan successfully and tie up the millionaire's wife to a wheelchair. The pianist tells them to call the inspector blackmailing him of his involvement in the murder and asks him to deliver the ransom at a destined address. The inspector accepts their proposal and promises to pay the ransom in exchange of the evidence and the millionaire's wife. In the meantime, the rickshaw driver and his wife tie up the pianist and go independently to collect the ransom. The millionaire's wife and the pianist happen to be held restrained in the same room where the millionaire's wife tells him that they can untie themselves and work cooperatively. At first, she unties the pianist who in turn removes the scarf tied on the wife's eyes. The wife double crosses him by misdirecting him and making him crash on to the nearby furniture. At that time, the doctor arrives, and he gets attacked by the millionaire's wife with a crutch. The pianist rushes after the noises made by the doctor and somehow catches hold of the millionaire's wife. The doctor applies chloroform on the millionaire's wife and gets her unconscious. The doctor and the pianist lock the wife's unconscious body in the car boot. In the meantime, the inspector arrives at the ransom drop location and sends the money bag by lift to the rickshaw driver. The inspector rushes to the floor specified by the rickshaw driver by stairs and finds him counting the money. The inspector shoots the rickshaw driver and goes after the rickshaw driver's wife who happens to be in the basement. Since the inspector takes the elevator, the driver alerts his wife of the inspector's arrival by lift. She immediately shuts off the power rendering the lift immobile. The inspector gets stuck in the lift without any immediate help available to him. The rickshaw driver's wife takes her husband to the hospital by rickshaw and asks the doctors there to attend to him immediately. As she opens the money bag, she finds the money bag containing paper notes. The inspector had fooled them by placing the real note on top of the bundle with the other notes in the bundle being paper notes. Now the doctor and the pianist drive off on a deserted highway and discuss using the millionaire's wife as an organ donor for transplanting liver and cornea, respectively. The doctor tells the pianist that he will use the wife's liver to transplant the liver of the sheikh's daughter in Dubai and her cornea to bring back the pianist's lost eyesight. The pianist does not agree to the doctor's proposition and instead decides to act justly. At the same time, they hear knocks coming from the car boot and the doctor stops the car to investigate. The movie then fast forwards to two years from the present date where the pianist's ex-lover comes across a piano concert by the same pianist at an undisclosed location in Europe. The show goes quite well and at the end of the show, the pianist gets complimented by his ex-lover, the girl. They both have coffee after the show with the girl asking him about his side of the story. The pianist narrates that the millionaire's wife had killed the doctor at the deserted highway while he went to investigate the noise. The wife then kicked the blind pianist out of the car and attempted to kill him by running the car over him but as a result of a butterfly effect, a hare happened to jump on to the car windshield and the wife lost control and the car she drove skidded off the highway and in turn going up in flames. So-saying he narrates the full story that transpired after the series of blackmailing events. He promises to invite her for his next concert and bids goodbye to her. But as he walks off the scene, it is revealed that his eyesight has been restored and he can see clearly as before leaving the audience thinking as to what really had happened after the car stopped at the deserted highway. It can be assumed that he had got the corneal transplant done somehow living to tell the tale.
A murder story followed by series of blackmailing events in turn followed by an ending that puzzles the audience as to what had happened really. Overall a nine out of ten for exceptional acting performances by Ayushmann Khurana and Tabu in their respective roles. Excellent story.",Andhadhun

This would be after a very long time the entire theatre experiencing a roller coaster ride along with the characters, so much fun- especially the first half, not a dull moment. 
The second half fails to retain the steam, though it gets back on track during the climax, winding up on the right note. 
It's an out an out Tabu film, very happy to notice she being utilized to her potential at last in mainstream films. 
Highly Recommended !!",Andhadhun
98,nizzambaharuddin,Fresh and original,8,13 January 2020,"I missed the chance to watch this film on the big screen when it was released here. Only now that I remembered about the film. And after watching it, I regretted that I didn't managed to watch the film in cinema.Probably the film's biggest strength is its originality. The plot feels fresh, it doesn't have the stereotypical stories of older Indian films. Granted Indian films has long since abandoned that type of stories. Although having said that, it has all the ingredients that's usually in a typical Indian film: murder, sex and betrayal. The film knows how to grip the audience. It probably made most of them on the edge of their seats watching.The film's unpredictable to say the least. There's enough mystery after mystery that will entice you to stay until the end of the film. You will try to keep guessing what will happen next, only for them to be thrown out completely by the film. The back-and-forth plot makes the film to feel as a tour-de-force.
However, for me its biggest strength is the characters. The film doesn't have a clear good and evil side, even though it is set up like that at first. Each characters have their own grey moral code, which makes the film feel realistic and gritty. Ayushmann Khurrana plays the blind man pianist part perfectly, sprinkle with Tabu's mischievous acting makes for an exciting conclusion.Having said that, there's probably a tiny flaw in the film: the zigzag storyline. Although the film pacing and storyline makes the film unpredictable, it also hurts the film in the sense of cohesion. The plot is moved from here to there and back here, making me feel like the film is trying too much to subvert your expectation that sometimes it feels like it's straying a bit far from the initial storyline just for the sake of being unpredictable. So, the technique feels like a double-edged sword in that regard.All in all, a very good film. Highly recommended.",Andhadhun

I don't know where to start to write a review.It has some spectacular acting by the actors. Ayushmann does a great job of being a non-blind guy acting like a blind guy to actually becoming blind and then recovering. His acting throughout the movie is spectacular. Radhika, although had a less and simpler role, performed her role really well giving it a natural look. Tabu was classy and beautiful and talented as always.The movie's synchronicity with its music is the best. The scene where Tabu is getting rid of the body while Ayushmann is playing the piano, acting blind but actually able to see everything, is something I've never seen in any cinema before. It looks straight out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The actions and movements are synchronized with the piano so well, that even the mood of the scene is communicated by the music. Not a single word is said. It's just music and acting and it is moments like these witch make the movie really something more of an experience.The overall story and screenplay is new and something one can't easily guess. It's told very smoothly and straightforward, but still its got enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of the seat. It has a lot of jumpy moments in itself too.It has comedy, drama and focus a thrilling suspense. New experiments like Andhadhun should be brought about in Indian Cinema. This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece.",Andhadhun

106,dev_alok,A blind tale,6,25 February 2019,I watched this movie on Amazon Prime because it was highly recommended by a friend of mine who has a bit of questionable taste. I am a fan of Ayushman Khurana and loved his work in Vicky Donor and also Badhai Ho. He was good in this movie too but this movie was really not much to write home about. Its a story of a pianist who is supposedly blind. Because he is supposed to be blind he is exposed to a number of crimes. He makes his way through a variety of situation and comes out holding his head on his shoulders. Movie kind of meanders. Tabu was kind of loud. Radhika Apte was good in a little role that she had. Movies takes just too many twists and turns that are quite improbable and you just keep feeling dizzy. Overall it is an ok but no great shake.,Andhadhun

113,bobandlulureview,What is life? It depends on the liver,9,12 October 2018,"Andhadhun (not to be confused with Andhadhund meaning excessive, rash) is inspired by L'Accordeur (The Piano Tuner), a French Short Film.PLOT : The film is about a blind piano player whose sole aim is to make money to be able to relocate to London and play the piano there. However, he unwillingly gets entangled in a murder. What follows are his frantic attempts at trying to escape the murderers that ends up with unearthing of secrets and major plot twists.
It goes without saying that the actors have done their jobs well.
I liked Tabu the best in the movie. She's a brilliant actress. It's lovely to see her don roles that befit her age and personality and not being merely typecast into a role one would ""expect"" her to play.
Sadly, Radhika Apte didn't have much of a role in the movie.
Ayushmann, Manav Vij (who looks like a beefed up Aamir Khan) and Anil Dhawan were good too.
Piano music makes up for most of the background music, the tenor oscillating with the mood of the protagonist (Ayushmann Khurrana). Such a background score comprising of one instrument rather than an orchestra, often brings a sense of realism to the scene and I like it that way. 
The USP of the movie is definitely the twists in the plot. I applaud the makers of the trailer who have craftily inserted scenes that reveal only so much that would make you want to watch the film, only to be then given a jolt within the first 15 minutes.
There were some brilliant moments that made us go ""aaah,we didn't expect that"", in fact one of the scenes towards the end almost had me clapping. 
The movie ends in a cliffhanger and it is left to the audience to interpret it in the manner he or she chooses to. Some suspect a sequel in the making, but I doubt that.
This is not your typical Bollywood film. No wait, I take that back. We have seen such a massive shift from the earlier norm of boy meets girl, saves her from the villain and the audience is invited to witness their happily ever after moment. But this film moves a step ahead. It is free from undying love, untainted protagonist, item numbers (Am I allowed to use the word 'Item'? Or is that being sexist?)...
Here come the brickbats:
There is too much of an attempt to keep the audience occupied with twists that at times it becomes a little too hotchpotch and in that process the Director/scriptwriter loses sense of the rational that has the audience questioning ""As if that could happen in real life"".
I wouldn't ask you not to watch it in the theatres. Go if you must, but remember seeing is not always believing ;)
Here's a fun fact, I read online - Sriram Raghavan, who is the Director of this film featured a blind girl playing the piano in the song Raabta in his film Agent Vinod.",Andhadhun

115,ahsawesa,Bollywood Thriller Done Right,7,20 February 2019,"I don't think I've ever properly reviewed a Bollywood film and these are definitely odd times to review one but I like to separate art from politics and simply celebrate the craft of storytelling put on display and this film excels at every single thing from acting to writing to music. This is the kind of movies that Bollywood SHOULD be making where the emphasis is on telling an interesting story instead of on item numbers, cheesy dance sequences, Salman Khan's biceps or visual effects.This is a Hitchcockian thriller about a blind pianist aspiring to become a star who gets into some serious trouble but things aren't quite how they seem. I won't say anything else.It spends the entire first act by making you like the protagonist. He isn't overly interesting or complex though he is quite charming (in fact this whole movie is). What makes him interesting is the circumstances around him. The inciting incident throws him into a corner and puts him in situations which turns his moral flaw from which he benefits but harms others, against him and challenges him.I breezed through the super fast paced first act, and somehow the second act outdid the first act as the conflict and tension kept building throughout the second act and since I really cared about the protagonist, there were some pretty nail biting sequences where I could cut the tension with a knife. There was a lot of spot on dark humor that had me in laughing my heart out. This is credit to a fantastic concept which I heard is inspired by a foreign short film but a lot of credit goes to the team of this film as well since it's not a direct adaptation.The story kept twisting onto itself and then .. it sort of deflated at the start of a third act which I felt like went in directions it didn't need to and became a typical Bollywood film until that ending where everything went CLICK and the film redeemed it's entire third act. The protagonist's character arc suddenly started to make sense because for a while I thought the film had lost it's steam in the final act and was becoming messy but I didn't know it was a setup for a fantastic reveal.The performances were all great too. Ayushman Khurana is a one man show here. The actors knew what they were doing and they were just having fun with the roles instead of taking themselves way too seriously. The music was great too, from all the piano covers to the original soundtrack of the film, was pretty catchy and instantly hooked me.Though this film follows simple beats of a story, it understands what makes a story good. It pits the main character against his biggest fears and challenges him in order to send him on a journey of change. It creates tension with conflict. These are simple things Indian filmmakers often overlook and this is why some of the blockbusters fail to work. It's not rocket science, they are simple things about storytelling.Props to siriram raghavan for this film, I had a lot of fun with it and it proved bollywood can make genuinely good films and that they SHOULD.Final Rating: 7.8/10. The third act could have been a little graceful but it was a little messy and over the top despite the ending which made up for it.

However, I was disappointed.
The first reason I will like to mention is, the totally deceptive and falsely enticing, plot summary, mentioned on this film's IMDb page:""He sees what he shouldn't. She sees what he couldn't. So the question is, does he see it or not?""The movie is unlike from whatever idea you might get from above. There is no suspense or doubt regarding his seeing abilities in the entire movie. There are some other hints and ideas you might get from the summary and all of them come out to be false on viewing.(this plot summary was written well before release, so I suppose it probably was the work of someone from the film making crew)
Second, the movie is a roller-coaster ride, in a bad sense. Let me explain: there are some films with twists and turns, you enjoy and appreciate, while there are others, like this one, in which the twists and turns, seem artificial, enforced and don't make any sense because they don't seem to go anywhere meaningful.Other major disappointment was the improper and incomplete closure around many plot elements.

119,agnihotrisanjay,Enjoyable thriller but...,7,6 October 2018,"Good movie with good twists, Crisp editing so it will not loose grip and keep you riveted. Tabu's roll was well developed and portrayed so she showed her class. Ayushmann Khurana's performance was not bad as well although his roll was not as well developed as Tabu's.Being a novelist, I have to be honest about the story. I will say that story could have been better crafted although there are some twists and turns, you enjoy and appreciate, while there are others, which seem artificial, enforced and don't make much sense. For example, after seeing the murder, Akash (Ayushmann Khurrana) behaved like a smart and intelligent person but when he went to police station he looked like an idiot. I would like to ask this group of story writers that on that very moment where was his friend (who helped him in coming to Landan). 
Similarly, when doctor(Zakir Hussain) and his helpers tried to take out his Kidney he very intelligently escaped the dangerous situation but soon after the same people tied him on the chair and he was not smart enough to anticipate the possible betrayed. So, during the entire movie I was not able to decide that he is smart or dumb. So the major disappointments was the improper and incomplete closure around many plot elements. There could be many interesting things which could have been done with the character of Radhika Apte, in place of adding Akash's imaginary friend who helped him in coming to Landan. I think the reason behind all this is very obvious - Four writers cocked the story- Arijit Biswas, Yogesh Chandekar, Sriram Raghavan, Pooja Ladha SurtiSanjay Agnihotri

The movie is undoubtedly one of the best I've seen this year.
The story telling is one of the smartest I've ever seen in Bollywood , and it takes a little piece from many Hollywood Thrillers in the last scene. I personally feel this exceeds Drishyam in the first half.Now coming to the second half , that's where movie falls for me.
The pacing starts to get bad , it gets hectic. It isn't that bad , but it will disappoint many big thriller fans. It starts to feel like typical Bollywood , which breaks the intensity first half sets. Its weird cause it depends on you , how will you feel about the second half.If you've seen many Hollywood/Bollywood thriller's and expect it to keep the first half magic , it will disappoint you. Although Don't hesitate watching the film.But if you're a casual watcher , not a movie freak. It will probably make Top 10 2018 for you*---------*---------*----------*---------*---------*#######(Spoilered review)#######The murder scene in the firdt half alone sells the movie for me. That scene is pure genius.Although I felt second half fells a bit short , the last kick of the can by Ayushman again won my trust to the movieReminds me of Shutter island at the end , when they try to get two endings to the movie , and leaves people in misery and generates theories.That ending is one of its kind in Bollywood.",Andhadhun

Film revolves around our main lead played by Ayushman K(A.k)and how he gets into unwanted situation and story delve deeper and reaching denouement. Basic Premise of the plot has a great potential and by the time of intermission first half will keep you edge of the seat. First half of the film was exceptionally brilliant and in second half film gets more chaotic with too much twist and turns which ended with Nolan style ending where the climax is kept opened for viewers to interpret all on their own. Problem with such open ending is that if viewers could squeeze something brilliant out of it then whole film seems brilliant otherwise not. Well, this is one film where makers have left no stone unturned to make each actor to perform their job terrifically. Be it Ayushman , Tabu or Manav vij or even an old lady next door. Radika apte is ubiquitous quite lately but here she was reduced to less screen time. Even non pivotal role played by ashwini kalsekar did an outstanding job. Definitely hard to pick one out of all. Coming to the music and bgm I'll say bgm was more noteworthy than music especially one scene where A.K plays piano at Tabu's home. On technical side direction was the almost flawless and cinematography was good too.

134,anupkranal,You better not miss this amazing roller coaster ride,10,6 October 2018,"Sometimes you watch a movie, and tell to yourself that there is no dearth of talent in Bollywood. Sriram Raghavan has been one such a talent and has proven it with Andhadhun. 
Andhadhun is the story of a blind piano player who gets involved in a murder. The story deals with how the piano player gets out of the hands of the perpetrators of the crime. Mostly a crime thriller is as strong as the suspense it can keep. But this time Director and writers relies mostly on the unexpected twists and turns. The biggest suspense whether Ayushman is blind or not is given off in the beginning of the movie itself.s
Performances
The strength of Andhadhun lies in the very intelligently used characters in the movie. The unexpected twists and turns could have never looked convincing without the over the top performances of the supporting cast. The movie stands on the outstanding performance of two of its lead cast Ayushman Khurana and Tabu. Tabu as Simi has been brilliant in the scenes where she tries to cover up her crimes. Ayushman has done an excellent job and portrayal of blind man is carried out by him with full conviction. After a long time, audience will watch Honeymoon (1973) fame Anil Dhawan on big screen and he proved to be a very good surprise package in Andhadhun. 
Direction and screenplay
The writers have done a wonderful job. The pace of the movie keeps on escalating with time and the tension build by the taut screenplay doesn't allow the audience to relax even for a minute especially after the first 30 minutes. The writing will surprise you every now and then, mostly so many subplots tend to confuse the audiences and here the craft of the director comes in handy. For director Sriram Raghvan, Andhadhun is not the first time, long back he has made a similar movie called Johnny Gaddar. This time with Andhadhun, Sriram has got better of his previous crime thriller outing. Even with subplots keeps on changing every 15 minutes or so, director Sriram Ragvan kept it non-confusing by dealing with subplots one at a time.
Cinematography
The cinematographer K.U. Mohanan didn't use much effects and kept it very simple. The camera movements are limited and are used beautifully to capture the details of the expressions of the characters. The Ayushman Khurana has to be applauded to give the cinematographers the much needed blind man expressions.
Music
Time and again Amit Trivedi has proved that he is master of background score. The background score of Amit Trivedi is not loud this time but very well supports the tense sequences in the movie. The movie does not have many songs but one ""naina da kya kassor"" is a good number.
What is good
1. Awesome performance by Tabu and Ayushman Khurana
2. Unexpected twists and turns
3. Edge of the seat thriller
4. Crisp writingWhat is not so good (hard to spot one)
1. Absence of suspense (audience will not complain though)Final Verdict

The story of 'Andhadhun' is inspired from the French short film L'ACCORDEUR (writer and director: Olivier Treiner). However, a lot of changes have been done which are praiseworthy.The suspense is nail-biting, but Andhadhun makes you laugh even during its most tense moments with its dark humour, which comes out beautifully and that helps the film from becoming too gory or disturbing.Everything in Raghavan's story (written with a team of writers) is there for a reason, even the opening scene of a rabbit being chased through cabbage fields by a hunter.
As crisp as the first half is, the only problem with AndhaDhun is that in the second half it stretches itself a bit toomuch. It suddenly decides to give its characters a lasting journey, hampering the story's elasticity and adding tiresome repetition to a film that is already 139-minute long. In fact, the first and second halves seem like two different stories altogether. The climax is interesting, it's worth watching out for the final scene!",Andhadhun

It provides an excellent refreshing break from the typical Indian movie story line.

140,spruthvi35,An exhilarating watch!,10,6 October 2018,"Story:
A visually challenged piano artist finds himself in a mess when he is invited by an ex-popular film star of Bollywood over to his apartment for a private concert. What follows next is anyone's guess.Screenplay:
Probably the most tightly kit screenplays in the recent times that Indian film has witnessed. Just so you know, Sriram reveals his pivotal plot point even before the first frame. Not with sound or dialogue or something else, just by simple text on the screen. That my friend is the definition of guts. The only complain I have is with the 'filmy' way in which the ending was conceived. Had it been a little better, the ending would have been a bang on! Of course, even now, it's no less from being a brilliant piece.Direction:
Fabulous! The way Sriram plays with the way we think about what's gonna happen next, he always, each and every time, he catches you off guard by being a step ahead! ""You think you are an intelligent patron, then I'm sorry to inform you, you 'll definitely miss out on many guesses"" is how I heard Sriram scream through the canvas.Cinematography:
Subtle colour palettes and decent take by KU Mohanan. Few shots are impressive. Some are frightening as hell! We'll witness more of him in Mahesh Babu's Maharshi.Editing:
Fantastic and on point! One of the best parts of the film is this satisfyingly fast and crisp cuts! There is this sharp transition from a very cheerful moment to a very intense moment and that was... Voila! Pooja Surti, the woman behind the editing desk, seems to be a very talented person and sad that she has done only a handful of films.Music:
The soul of the film is this Amit Trivedi's far beyond the excellent score. He is one of the most underrated music composers in India, a sad truth. Nevertheless, he gave an absolute blast of music here. The piano was on fire!Performances:
Ayushman and Tabu gave really legit performances. And yes, of course, you have the Netflix girl Radhika doing her bit. The supporting cast was really good too, no complaints at all.Final Take:
Though it is a one-time-watcher for most of the people, the amount of cinema study that one can do in this film is of great magnitude. An excellent outing from Sriram and team. Do not miss this exhilarating watch.",Andhadhun

142,nitish-thebest-191995,A movie you just can't afford to miss !! Exceptionally brilliant !,10,10 October 2018,"""They don't make such movies anymore"" That's the thought that came to my head while I got up after this roller-coaster of a ride came to it's end,or did it ? Apart from feelings of extreme excitement and a gush of energy all due to the amazement towards the smartly crafted end,I was left with no words to describe this masterpiece !! From start to finish,all just seemed so perfect,in fact,at times,beyond perfect !! These are the kind of movies you actually live for,the ones you can applaud for a really really long time even after it's present tenure ends.The actors were exceptionally good in their skills,Ayushmann was really smooth in his approach but for me the stand-out performance was by Tabu.Again proving her calibre,she was way too amazing in certain scenes,bringing out humour with sparks of insanity interpersed between some really serious moments throughout the entire movie ! But among all of this,the real star is Sriram Raghavan himself ! Such skillful camera angles,gripping screenplay and a story so interesting in it's approach,you can barely even afford to wink with the scare of missing something important ! This is vintage Raghavan,at his very,very best.By far,this is one of his best works till date in a category which flaunts movies like ""Ek Haseena thi"" and ""Badlapur"" !
A big salute sir,wish I could hug you for this one ! A huge thanks for this brilliant,out-of-the-box,gripping thriller.Really wishing for more such ventures in the future from you !A ""MUST WATCH"" definetly,Andhadhun just gives you everything.From a curiosity-filled canvas to an eerie yet extremely enjoyable atmosphere,subtle nuisances with the camera-work which work wonders leading people to say ""Oh my God"" and ""Haww"" so many times,I haven't enjoyed a movie so so so much in the recent times !! 
Remembering certain scenes of the movie are still giving me goosebumps ! Don't miss it at any cost !! Such movies are really rare to come across nowadays!",Andhadhun

144,SHSandh,Suspense; Fast paced; Lots of Bollywood songs on the piano; Apt title; Poor casting for the pianist; Illogical basis to the story,7,1 October 2019,"The movie has suspense and is fast paced, with not a dull moment.However, the story seems a bit illogical. It shows a pianist (piano player) who is not blind but pretends to be blind as (he says) it helps him in his music. This player is shown going outdoors for all his work and performances with dark glasses but no eye band to bar his eyes from seeing. He could therefore be seeing all the time with his dark glasses. This makes us wonder whether he was doing a smart thing to just garner a sympathetic following for his music.Plenty of lovely piano music is played by the protagonist in the movie. Ayushmann Khurrana (AK) was not an exquisite choice as a pianist - he does not have long fingers or a prominent little (pinky) finger. Check the 2002 movie 'The Pianist' (3 Oscars) by Roman Polanski where Adrien Brody played the pianist. Also, AK could have been a lot more subtle with his blind man's act -- while playing the piano and especially when having to witness a murder.Tabu and Radhika Apte were a treat to watch. Personally, it was also a treat to watch Zakir Hussian. Manav Vij as the policeman did not impress. The rest of the acting was okay.Considering the meaning of the Hindi word 'andhadhun', the title of the movie seems apt as it deals with the avoidable travails of a musician who pretends to be blind all the time and gets into a lot of trouble for that.Also, suddenly, the story seems a bit implausible after Ayushmann Khurrana somewhere in between avers that he now has really become blind.",Andhadhun

148,nikhil7179,Blind man's bluff,8,29 September 2019,"Raghavan is a modern master of the cat and mouse thriller, where hunter and prey constantly switch roles.He has always reveled in subverting genre conventions and audience expectations, but with Andhadhun he really ups the ante, throwing in a twist every ten-fifteen minutes, and flipping the story in a new direction.The reversals mostly work, but even when they don't, it's a hell of a lot of fun watching the characters (that include a ""Blind"" Pianist, a Bollywood has been, his adulterous trophy wife, her musclebound lover and several others) try and outfox each other.A blind protagonist might suggest Oedipus Rex and Greek Tragedy, but Raghavan aims squarely for (black) comedy.There is a sense of ghoulish delight with which he and his co-writers put these characters through the wringer.There are nods to Hitchcock (Rear Window, North by Northwest), Park Chan Wook (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance, Oldboy) and the Coens (Fargo) and clever inside jokes referencing Shakespeare and even Karz!Although Badlapur was a return to form for the director, Andhadhun is classic Raghavan, and his best since Johnny Gaddar, confirming his status as Bollywood's master of suspense.",Andhadhun

The unfolding of the story is extremely abnormal, absolutely! At the end, if the male lead bypassed the can, it would be a real movie! The film wasn't deliberately horrible, but there were several places in the film that were really scary. The female host was sitting on the male host's chair and suddenly wore a ghost mask.

Usage of many twists to keep the audience from not settling & visual clues to get them to continuously decipher. Andhadhun followed this style too.Caught his Article 15 previously, in which he played a newly appointed cop in a rural area where caste divides run deep.

Sounds philosophical. We don't know if it's the person being referred or the body organ. Everything in the movie has two meanings. It's rarely I watch any movie twice - Andhadhun happens to be that movie. Apart from the story-line, there's a ton of hidden puzzles, clues and in general the director communicating with us either paying homage to certain movies or the 70s or clues in general. This movie is not just a movie, it's a dark comedy, an experience that will leave you confused, entertained and most of all questioning what exactly happened.**If you haven't seen the movie, don't read any further. You have been warned.**I won't dwell into the story-line, that's not analysis that reading out of a book. Hint: Most reviews tell you the story. In my opinion that's bad writing and owning a website domain doesn't make you a writer. Moving on. Here are few questions that might pop up in your head and I'll try and analyze them.1) Movie starts with ""Ek lambi kahaan hai, Coffee?"". This might imply parts of the story-line might be the protagonist's (Akash) point of view. What is true, what is not, it's up to you to believe.2) Simi's character tries to run over Akash with the car. Another homage to ""Karz"" from the 70s where the actor's real name is Simi Garewal. Coincidentally Sriram Raghavan's first movie was ""Ek Hasina Thi"", another homage to the movie ""Karz"". As you can tell, the director likes to tease his audience in subtle ways.3) The Ending- Lot of questions about the ending. The director very cleverly cut the part to where they changed the scene to Europe and then continues with A-Kash's version. The truth? We will never know but my analysis is he took the deal with the doctor. A-Kash also could imply the one with the money. Another pun, another tease indicating he has the money now. And the friend he was talking about was Daani, she was someone Akash could trust. Also, at one point in the movie she was shown to talking to someone over the phone for a few seconds. Nothing happens in a Raghavan movie without a reason.4) Radhika Apte's characters father wearing a tee shirt with a rabbit printed on it. Hint. Clue. Tease.5) Akash acts as Ismael the detective, right after that they click a picture and maushi says ""Ismael"" please. Tease. Pun.I don't think this level of intelligent cinema can be matched up for a long time to come. Sriram Raghavan's best movie so far! Watch it only if you want to look beyond the story-line, if you grew up understanding Indian Cinema, if you like Pune, if you understand subtle dark comedy, if you speak the same language as the director. Both Hindi and Cinema language. I had two meanings there for a reason. Catch it if you can.",Andhadhun

190,whytryharder,Andhadhun is a BLOODY HOOT!,10,6 October 2018,"Andhadhun is a BLOODY hoot! 
A taut crime tale of a blind man and his artsy screw ups. This movie easily is one of the finest thrillers to ever come out of Bollywood and will go down as one of the best crime musicals, if there ever happens to be a genre like that. Ayushman Khurana has given a splendid performance as an experimental blind man who gets into so many things that it becomes a natural instinct of the audience to know and explore more about what happens to him. Sriram Raghavan is modern day Vijay Anand, as a master crime caper specialist, he knows how to present his taste onscreen extremely well. Vivid but small setups haphazardly spread characters but bound together, highly contrasted and colorized shots, few colorful characters and a pace that never lets you think away about anything else other than next frame. I forgot when was the last time I saw a first half in Bollywood that was as intense as this one. Mark my words - the way first crime scene is picturized while the blind pianist plays symphonies while being a mute and blind spectator to a crime, is nothing short of a pure gold class masterpiece and will go down as an instant classic in the list of greatest scenes ever filmed in movies. The explicit parallels drawn between two extremes in that scene is wholly on another level and shows the Raghavan class we have been familiar with since ever. This movie takes his definitions of the depiction of crimes on whole another level after a gruesome depiction in Badlapur and a high shock value execution in Johnny Gaddar. Musical symphonies often represent the mood and put you at unease. Scenes with Beethoven Symphony 5 as background score are a great example of what a fine musical taste can do to an otherwise great scene in silos, and exalts the overall weight of a scene many times. Old Bollywood style tunes scattered in beginning and jazz music with high tempo gel extremely well with the fast-paced scenes. The only weak point of the movie is that it disintegrates a bit towards the end where new characters are introduced and a new storyline gives albeit a good support to the overall story by the climax. It still lefts out few questions nonetheless but if you sum it all up - it is an amazingly well-done flick with nuanced filmmaking of Sriram Raghavan - the best crime master of modern age Bollywood and great performances of Tabu, Ayushman Khurana and supporting castes. 
8.5/10 for me.",Andhadhun
191,brijmm-212-35989,Not a masterpiece but just an entertaining mystery,5,20 October 2018,"Andhadhun starts of well and builds to the mystery quite well too, that's the first half of the movie. Second half is where it loses the plot completely. The twists are illogical, characters become unrealistic and not believable. The story just seems to go out of hand and by the time it reaches the climax you would be left thinking about when it will end.You would be hooked to the movie as it is a mystery thriller, but if you give a thought to it the entire plot seems to be full of loopholes and completely unconvincing.Just good enough to entertain you, but not close enough to a masterpiece.",Andhadhun

Later he meets Pramod Sinha( Anil Dhawan) a veteran actor who invites him to his home for a party where he meets Simmi (Tabu) Pramod's wife . Here starts the movie and happenings in it.A number of twists and turns leads to a climax which is good. Talking about acting Ayushman and Tabu has done great job .

202,mesun-716-429723,Great but not really great,6,23 December 2018,"A lot of people exhibit their emotions and satisfaction level with the movie in their review instead of actually reviewing of the movie. I get it, this is first time, the average Indian viewer has got to see some cleverly thought provoking and engaging movie instead of standard senseless Khan movies. But for those who have seen movies like The Killing of Sacred Deer, Elle or even Atomic Blonde, this movie fundamentally does not offer anything new. The plot does have some interesting twists, performances are great, Ayushmann is natural, Tabbu is excellent as usual but that is about it. The direction of photography is sub par except few scenes, sound designing and recording is painfully doing the disservice to the movie and production designing is below average. Looks like they had very low budget. Even lighting is either over done or under done at many scenes. Editing is good for most part and probably is the only saving grace from technical sides. And this is inspired from a french short movie, which is ok because extending it to that long is good job done by Raghvan. Overall must watch but dont get mesmerized.",Andhadhun
203,avinash_me_28,A cinema experience that you must feel.,10,14 October 2018,"Andhadhun is a kind of movie which is not very regular . It's unconventional with reference to indian movies making point of view.Now a days ,Indian directors are getting more into making mature cinema . They are now stopping the spoon feeding Which might be risky for box office collection But somebody has to do it and Shri Ram Raghwan is that one man who is continuously doing it from his very first cinema Ek hasina thi. He btought us contents that generally do not portray in indian cinemas. Andhadhun is definitely his best work. That doesn't mean his previous works were mediocre. He never made a bad movie.
 This movie is filled with enough twist and turns that will hold you for its entire span . Story is the star in the movie. In a movie like this where so many strings are hanging, must be well connected and Director is successful in doing that . Where you feel ,an end is left to attach or a loophole is present , You should think twice or thrice because it is done deliberately just to add some more dimensions . You have to decide which path you want to see story follows. The main lead, blind character performed by Ayushman khurana is a wonderful treat to eyes. His character is very much complex but he nailed it with such a ease that it doesn't feel for a bit of second . After a while you may feel his misery inside you . 
This is certainly a feather in his crown. A great performance indeed. Tabbu's performance is also top notch . She is doing such a great work in this age. Drishaym is a great example.If a movie in thrill and suspense zone can stand against andhadhun , It's drishyam. It's a coincidence that both movie deals with visual theme but totally different . Wherein drishyam everybody is seeing but not seeing the things which is going on around them and here in Andhadhun ,main lead is not seeing but seeing the things . 
This movie is based on a short story , a short film is also made on this subject but making a full length movie is something different and tedious too with a subject like this. Full marks for direction. 
Editing is something that can make a average cinema superlative . Editing department earn full marks for doing justice with the story and making it a gritty, edgy cinema experience.
Go watch it for a great cinema experience.",Andhadhun

206,mitkobozov,Half-blind rabit a running thope,9,23 February 2019,"Why a rabbit? It is the running theme through out the movie. My personal opinion is that the rabbit is a trope. Just for your information rabbits sleep with open eyes so that they are always alert for danger. Think about this while watching the movie.
Akash is neither blind nor seeing. He is in a limbo state. His visiion was taken after witnesing a crime and after a sort of redemption his eyesight is back. My theory is that in fact the makers of the movie are setting up a katharsis of a sort. What is more we are all left in the dark. We are blinded for what really happened and that's what makes the movie a masterpiece. We as viewers having eyes, still can not see the full extent of what actually happens in the physical world. We are also in a way ""blind"" for the motives and desires of other people. Sophie remains blind for Akash's real charecter, and so are we. Simi is ""blind"" when it comes to Pramod's motives of going to Bangalore and he is ""blind"" when it comes to her inner world. Maybe only Akash has the qualities of a rabbit seeing in the dark while sleeping and only he fully understands the world around him after his sight is back.",Andhadhun

It is a out-and-out thriller that is set in a amazing yet brutal world filled with individuals that have more going on than they initially let on.Pros:
Characters feel like real people which certainly helps the story feel grounded and well, real.
The world the director creates is urging to be explored further.
Cons:
Now this is nitpicking however, I felt the movie could have been ""tighter"" in terms of the story telling especially towards the last act of the movie.
Finally I felt the ending should have been less of a ""happy ending"" for our main character as a darker ending would certainly suit our main character.All in all it was an amazing movie, filled with interesting characters and a setting that makes the characters feel grounded and brings them to life.",Andhadhun

The best part of the movie is that it makes you think that you know what coming next only to make your predicament wrong.@ayushmannk fine performance as smart blind piano is very canny and few may contemplate his artistic skills with that of Legend #SanjeevKumar. 
@Tabuism is getting wiser and crisp actor as she is ageing. Her performance adds lots of fan following that what she had 2Decades back.
@Radhika_Apte a 
#ManavVij as a Cop, #AnilDhawan as yesteryear superstar and husband of Tabu, #AshwiniKalsekar as intimidating cop wife or any other co-artists support & contribute power in creation of this thriller.These kinds of movie needs soulful music but lesser songs, Songs are the only brakes in this perfect flawless movie. #SriramRaghavan has successful exposition and presentation of movie in such a manner that one will keep confabulating. His pre-visualisation of thriller also as a cowriter adds feathers to direction.

This is definitely the best movie of the year and that too by a mile. The screenplay, the acting, the direction, everything come together to give you a thrilling cinematic experience and me as an audience were left just in awe. The story is simple, it is a murder/ coverup and not a who done it story. But the manner in which the characters mingle and how the dynamics change is just a treat to watch. Its fun, dark and a subtle message about organ theft. All arranged effortless with great direction and editing. Ayushman Khurana is brilliant with his portrayal of his character Akash, Tabu as usual delivers a performance which you can only marvel at. The supporting cast does their bit too very well. I really hope this movie does well in terms of entertaining ppl and as well as commercially as it can really define what else can come out of Bollywood.

Ayushmann is lovable as the cheerful blind musician, and Radhika Apte is convincing as usual. Tabu and other characters play their parts well, and the story is very engrossing. However, the second half of the movie completely squanders the set up. An interesting story line completely devolves into several incredulous double crossings, needless plot points and characters, and an end that does not tie up all the loose ends: you will walk out feeling disappointed. Also - I was surprised to learn Amit Trivedi composed music for this film: overall background scores and music in general seemed very forgettable and average.

Confused? That's what the movie is.The twisted nature of humans is shown in the movie. Like koi kuch bhi kar Sakta hai lekein over the limit kabhi nahi jaate (anyone can do anything but never gets overboard).Ayushman and Tabu are exceptional but the actual surprise is music.

The movie kept me hooked throughout, and even when the film ended I debated myself with the answer. It is not only the ending that matters but also the journey and for me this movie had both.

This crime thriller is filled with twists and turns which leaves the audience with a lot to think and analyze about. Every bit of the screenplay after the first 15 minutes grips on to it's viewers as that's how interesting the plot is. It's all in the direction which depicts story telling at it's best. Sriram Raghavan's best one till date. The movie is about a blind man caught in various heart wrenching events after a murder of a famous personality. The rest is just left for you to enjoy it's suspense. Ayushmann khurrana and Tabu have pulled off this epic thriller in the best way possible. Tabu especially has nailed her character which is sure to leave an impact on you even after the movie. The background scores are majorly piano tunes which perfectly matches that particular scene. The climax is left open which can be interpreted in numerous ways as to what is actually true and what's not. Overall movies like these keeps our hopes alive in Bollywood and still can entertain the audience exceptionally.

This I can say one of the best thriller presented by Sriram Raghavan after Johny Gaddar. When you guess this would be the next, it proves you false and that is what the speciality of the movie is. The storyline of the movie is simple so much so the execution of the same is favourite. The acting if we talk about, Ayushman is all way rocking, handsome and fragrance of talent. Same for tabu. Radhika Apne didn't have so much to do but she too was good. This is not a whodunit kind of murder mystery because you know who committed murder from the scenario itself. It is a different movie for all the audience and of you can crack it, try to do it in the end.....(Bunny is my favourite)",Andhadhun

Probably the best in bollywood.,10,26 October 2021,"If there's one thing I absolutely love about movies, whether hollywood or bollywood, is the sheer originality of a movie. After watching numerous bollywood movies that were hollywood rip-offs, I was absolutely amazed to see such a movie.Everything about the movie, the story, the twist, the thrilling nature, the music, overall cinematography, etc. Is just spot-on. There are very few bollywood movies that are capable of giving such an experience to the audience.Every second of this movie is unexpected. Just like Pulp Fiction, you cannot predict what is going to happen in the next minute, which is the primary premise of giving a thrilling experience to the audience. Definitely deserves a 10/10 rating.",Andhadhun

253,umesh1606,Itzz messy thriller with dark humour,7,13 October 2018,Andhadhun is fabulous in making..it makes you freak out as the movie progresses.but I have serious milliondollar question 'WHAT MAKES TABU TO OPEN A DOOR AND INVITE A STRANGER LET IN WHEN THERE IS MESSY SITUATION INSIDE HOUSE.is she so dumb???what ever be the reasons directed SRIRAM RAGHAVAN had intelligently crafted it by taking cinematic liberity in this regard. Other than that movie is fantastic watch with tight screenplay and music by amit trivedi is highlight of the film.overall it appeals to all sections of audience. Just see and enjoy!!,Andhadhun
254,pspareek,Sriram Raghvan is India's Martin Scorsese!,10,7 October 2018,Like another reviewer said the movie is to be seen and anything about the storyline would be a spoiler. My 2 cents: just watch out for the numerous inside jokes on the characters such as Tabu referred as Lady Macbeth and posters of similar genre movies such as Darwaza. An ode to the past is just the prologue in his movies. Sriram Raghvan is a genius and a precious gift to the Indian cinema. 10 on 10.,Andhadhun
255,vikuutt,Excellent Movie spoilt by the last 30 minutes,7,23 December 2018,The movie runs flawlessly fine until the two(won't name) are held tied to a chair in the room. It gets boring from there and makes it hard to believe what goes on at the end. Disappointed with that.,Andhadhun

257,samfox-956-519711,ANDHADHUN....Go for it.....Blindly!,9,8 October 2018,"ANDHADHUN
(No Blind Spots....)Making a gripping thriller is undoubtedly a task not everyone can prove equal to. Probably this is why we have very few gems in this genre (Johnny Gaddar, Drishyam...). Inspired by a French short film, L'Accordeur (The Piano Tuner), this film is about an extremely talented pianist who is 'blind'. Everything seems to be going fine until he catches the fancy of a retired movie star who invites him to his house. How this visit sparks off a series of (hilariously) unfortunate events, is the fantastic story of ANDHADHUN.AYUSHMAN KHURANA keeps it absolutely simple as the blind pianist and yet, he shines. He isn't exactly in the league of Rajkumar Rao but given the right role (which suits his uncomplicated style), he manages to do a decent job. Here, he displays the right mannerisms of a blind person and remains within the requirement of the role. This is probably the best performance of his career thus far.RADHIKA APTE is hardly challenged by the role of AYUSHMAN's girlfriend and she goes about her task like the super performer she is; putting her big, expressive eyes and apt facial expressions to fantastic use. TABU enacts the role of ANIL DHAWAN's wife effortlessly in her signature style of understated elegance. She swings from being innocent and loving to sly and sinister in the blink of an eye. Her character has great scope for black humour which she expertly brings to the fore.ANIL DHAWAN plays himself; a yesteryear movie star enjoying his retirement. He seems to be totally enjoying his role and is a delight to watch. He really needs to be commended for being a sport to allow jokes at his expense. He is the surprise package of this flick. ZAKIR HUSSAIN adds a straight-faced humourous angle to his seemingly one-track role of a doctor who is up to no good. ASHWINI KALSEKAR is at her loudest best in the role of a loving but violently possessive wife of a cop. Like always, she makes her presence felt even in a small role. MANAV VIJ plays the cop almost wordlessly; allowing his eyes to do all the emoting. The rest of the supporting actors sparkle in their small roles.The offbeat script has been written with an eye for detail and never loses direction. The casting is so appropriate that the actors fit snugly into their respective places in the story. The dialogues are fresh and have been intelligently written with humour inconspicuously woven into the apparently grim nature of the narrative.The soundtrack is genuinely different; primarily because of the use of the piano in songs as well as background score. The songs never seem out of place and the background music in some of the action sequences have a retro feel which adds to the novelty. 'Naina Da Kya Kasoor' and 'Laila Laila' by AMIT TRIVEDI are foot tapping, peppy numbers which will make you want to shake a leg. 'Woh Ladki' is a soft romantic song by ARIJIT and the title track by RAFTAAR is a fast, fun number.SRIRAM RAGHAVAN has made quite a name for himself in the thriller genre; having already directed flicks like Ek Hasina Thi, Johnny Gaddaar and Badlapur. True to his style of film making, SRIRAM makes a fast-paced, engaging film which will keep you transfixed. ANIL DHAWAN's track in the plot is utilised to play snippets of old classics like Ye Jeevan Hai and Teri Galiyon Mein and this is so deftly done that without being obtrusive, it blends with the storyline.The wit and situational humour evokes spontaneous laughter. Smartly edited, the film has a lot happening in every frame. Its worth can be gauged from the fact that despite you being aware of what has happened and how, the film manages to hold your attention till the very end.ANDHADHUN is almost perfect (Gosh, it has been such a long time since I said this for a film!). So go ahead and grab a ticket. The director has dealt you such a good hand....you can safely play BLIND!

@hamadreyami
Film Critic & directorWhen Radhaika goes to visit her blind lover in his
house with non-makeup, will you expect this scene from another Hindi film was it Radhaika or another Actress ? This is what I call the signature of Shri Ram Raghvan ""A week ago, director Vishal Bhardwaj inspired from a short story ""Do Bahni"" and made his long feature ""Patakha"" now the same Shri Ram Raghavan is inspired by the short French film about blind pianist ""The Piano Tuner""
The idea, story, events and scenes is very difficult to told even indirectly I do not to exceed the virginity of this work, you must see it by yourself.As for the official trailer you know some of the main characters , the blind piano player Ayushmann khurrana and the mysterious lady which played by Tabu and the girl friend of blind man played by Radhika Abte.I am sure that the director Shri Ram when he was watching the French film delighted and promised himself to make out somthing different and new offcurse by his way, there is a scene in the French film which is very similar to the scene of the Andhadhun, which gives me great tension , I was telling myself that I will watch now a copy of the French movie but when that scene ends the Raghvan action starts with crazy and interesting storytelling in
The first part will take your all attention so my advice to you do not go to watch the movie unless you have not finished all your conversations and messages in your mobile!The scenario painted by Mr. Raghan
it is above the imagination of any intelligent or even ingenious audiences In short, you will be on a date with a great cinema
There is a wonderful mix between the subconscious mind and the perfect heart of the cinema artThe first part was written successfully, but the second part was covered with some frills, because of the reverberations
I felt that in front of the seat Mr. Raghvan was sitting in the cinema and saw my face and he quickly changed and clear all misunderstanding and return back my attention
The genre of this film is thrille black comedy, there are those who would like comedy and maybe can not be satisfied because of thier relaied on old school comedy ! perhaps some would say that director did not succeed to make me more excited !
Simply this kind of films depends on a single thread from start to finish and anything embedded in between will kills the main mood of it ,so it's better what was on the screen which not destroy the movie symphony woven which grown in my mind from the opening sceneMost of scenes written cleverly every scene i is so special that I've titled them ! For example, the scene of Ayushman playing piano at the house of Tabu (of course the scene is available in the trailer and this is not spolling )This scene itself is a short film full of the desire of any viewer loves the cinema, and many others scenes with full of surprises (Raghvan will Iarit you lend me your brain just for one week)!The soundtrack is USP of Andhadhun is , how much I adore Piano, especially if the pieces come into contact with every scene of the film.Amit trivedi Rafter & Grish NakodThe camera work is convenient with the film MR K.u.mohanan do not need
Lots of effort.Tabu said in her interview that she did not learn acting, I will say thank you that you did not practice acting otherwise where I can get new words to admiration you ! Spontaneous performance , you will not know what this character wants and when she will surprised you, Tabu gave the character ""Simi"" whicu written on the paper , life in front of the screen.
Ayushmann khurrana by his role gave me a reason to be more interested for his upcoming films , he is the blind Akash piano player, was really looks piano player as well as real blind man This is his most powerfull performance in his career.Radhika Apti presence is important even if the role is almost short and she has become a required artist to perform in any artistic film.There are other intersting roles such as Zakir Hussain who beautifully appearance and with him there is a lady who is lottie paper seller add more flavour to the black comedy
not forget the actor of the 70s, Anil Dahwan, brother of director David Dahawan and the uncle of the film star Varun Dahawan who worked with Raghavan in Badalabur
I was intrigued by the role of Anil maybe happend because of Varun , but Raghavan does not play randomly the role was suitable to Anil as for his real condition .Director Shri Ram Raghavan I was very pleased to receive your film ""Andha Dhun"" which means ""blind melody"" not as I read it wrong in the past!
I have the honor to be one of those who saw your work in this life so do not be late for your new project I am waiting for you in the futureGo and watch the film in the cinema , close your eyes and ears form anyone who wants to spoil the story
I want to give it yesterday 3.5 out of 5 but after waking up this morning the film was stuck in my mind which forced me to give it4.5 out of 5",Andhadhun

Akash's character appears be the most morally correct character of all but movie keeps you wondering why he keeps the simple fact from his sweetheart. We see the contradictions in other characters... Although there are songs, there are no dance sequences which is rare in bollywood movies and a welcome development for mystery movies like this. Khurrana and Tabu performed well and others are okay.

270,s0ulf00d,Shallow,1,27 October 2018,"If plot twist after plot twist after plot twist after plot twist after plot twist ad infinitum keeps you entertained even when the so-called plot has not been sufficiently laid out - go for it. Me? I got tired of the twists.The characters are given classy dialogues but depth is sacrificed at the expense of a plot twisted around itself in a dozen knots. Dilliwala Ayushmann Khurrana makes no attempt to let go of his dilli heritage. For example, when he's angry, his trademark annoyance expressed in rapidfire spitting of sentences is same across all his movies. Didn't look for a moment that he belonged to Pune.Acting by others in the main cast is mediocre at best. The only character who shone in acting is the betrayed wife of the police officer. Her expressions and responses are extraordinarily well done in every single frame! Hats off to her. Too bad her role was paltry. Her amazing acting was the only highlight of this movie.It's a film written for the forever finger swiping smartphone generation that outsources cerebral functioning to apps loaded on their screens. With their phones on silent, any appreciation of depth or meaning in life is lost on to them. All they care for is to swipe from one twist to the other.",Andhadhun

Set in Pune, there is a certain starkness to the environment that only lends an edge to the plot which races and slows down, twists and turns till you really wonder how will the story end.The cinematography ( K.U Mohanan) is really good. If anything, it raises your interest in the plot. Of course, Sriram Raghavan the director handled his characters very deftly. There was not an expression out of place. That brings us to the three stalwarts - Ayushmann Khurana, Tabu and Radhika Apte. ace deliveries from all three. Radhika did not have much screen time but Ayushmann Khurana delivered a stellar performance and Tabu....simply lovely....though once you watch the movie, you won't want to use that word to describe her character! Her performance was wild and wonderful.

Whether you're a fan of neo-noir films or not, ""Andhadhun"" for sure will make you laugh-red. Ayushman is still a mystery box. You can't expect what he can deliver to you. I watched it and would like to recommend those who deserve to be surprised in every single minute.
ACTING - Every single character has proved their casting. 
DIRECTION - The best of Raghvan. 
MUSIC - You don't want to spoil your attention, so you must not sing or you'll loose yourself. Otherwise, music will make your eyebrows more intense. 
CONTINUITY - Don't think of waste discussing the fun while watching with your friend.

286,Nish3012,Slow yet intriguing and gives nostalgic feeling of see if the old Hindi movies.,8,18 October 2018,"Andhdhun is a neither a thriller nor a tradegy movie. Director Shriram raghvan has managed to strike a perfect balance between comedy and suspense but in bit. The movie opens with a hunter trying to kill a rabbit and that scene is the most crucial part of the story (not the movie though).
Ayushman khurrana plays as Akash is an artist who is blind and plays a piano. He aspires to be a great pianist one day and is trying to complete his piece of music. He also tries to be financial sufficient for he wishes to go to London and take part in a competition. Radhika apte (Sophie) has a very small role and is a daughter of a restaurant owner. She meets with Akash accidentally quite literally. Akash tells her he is a pianist and Sophie offers him a job at the restaurant to play piano in the evening. 
At this restaurant he meets a old Hindi actor named pramod Sinha played by anil dhawan. Tabu (Simi) is his wife who wants to be an actress in movie. Pramod tries his way to get her in the film but is not successful. pramod invites Akash to play piano at his home as it's marriage anniversary of pramod and Simi. 
Akash goes to his home as promised and plays the piano while tabu and her lover tries to clean up the body of pramod. The scene is the comic because of the circumstances. What follows is the story of akash running for his life and being played by different people. Tabu, her lover , an autodriver, a doctor everyone plays with Akash eventhough he plans to blackmail tabu and get money from her. He only survives because he has luck in his favor. Even though the movie is slow post interval don't miss the last 10 minutes as the opening scene is looped her. The last scene though predictable is the master stroke by the director.The soundtrack is not very catchy expect for the ""Naina da Kya kasoor hai"". While they used some dialogue and songs from old Hindi movie which will make you nostalgic if you have watched those movies. Though the story is slow and audience is never kept in the dark, it's engaging but in bits. If you have liked Sriram raghvan previous movie like Johnny gaddar, agent vinod and badlapur you will like this too. Watch it for aysuhsman and tabu's performance.",Andhadhun

I was not expecting much, when I began watching this title on Netflix yesterday. The movie went by at the pace of a romantic comedy at first.I was hooked the moment Ayushman's artist character spots the dead body in Tabu's house. From then on, it is an endless array of brilliant turns and never ending thrilling incidents that make up the movie.I loved the many details scattered around by the director for the viewers to find. Tremendous respect for the entire team that managed to weave an entire storyline with very little to hold it together but a tight script.All the characters are rich and colourful, right from the policeman's wife, to the doctor with his conflicting morals of selling Tabu's organs.

Ayushmann couldn't have done a better job. Fantastically and smoothly portrays the character of Akash. Tabu as Simi convincingly plays a conniving villain. Every single character does an outstanding job of taking you through the plot. Surprises at every corner and yet you realize you should have of course expected it.
If we were in the days of past with unichannel consumption of entertainment content, Andhadhun could've easily achieved the iconic status Jaane Bhi Do Yarron enjoys today. Simply outstanding!
An easy 10/10 on my most picky scale.",Andhadhun

A wonderful thriller spread. The elaborately scripted details, down to the tiniest of props, expressions and movements; the fabulous, at times comical interplay of actors; the play with camera in the defined space; the sharp editing.

The performance of Ayushmann is awesome and how he got into the character is way too good. Notably, Tabu is the show stealer and portrayed the fearless character of killing people is way too surprising. Nice job For the director Sriram Raghavan with connecting and relatable plots and twist at the end. Also, as a Punekar I was really happy to see the locations on screen and the places they mentioned😊. Only the second half was a kind of slow but very much acceptable. Kudos to the team 😊👍",Andhadhun

It is by far the best film of 2018. Ayushmaan and Tabu are in excellent form and so is Radhika Apte in her supporting role. Sriram Raghvan again proves why he is the best at thrillers. 8/10",Andhadhun

329,ppbaruah09,Highly recommended,10,17 October 2018,"Years ago while watching 'Jhonny Gaddar', the name Sriram Raghaban made a great impact in my mind. That was a mindblowing movie which eventually didn't make a great deal in the box office. His last movie Badlapur did better financialy, but for me, Jhonny was the best among all of his works including Ek Hasina Thi.So years later when the trailer of Andhadhun surfaced I saw the same sparkle of Jhonny in it and I was right. What a rolar coaster ride of witty twists is Andhadhun. and choosing Ayushman for the lead role is the perfect choice the director made.I don't think any other actor could have pulled it so believably like him. Highly recommend it and if you like then kindly watch Johnny Gaddar too. You will love the later.",Andhadhun
330,pagliani-p,Mediocre,5,18 August 2019,"I decided to watch it because it's the 4th Indian in the top 250 and it is ranked above, Jurassic Park, Fargo, Sixth Sense and so on. Too bad this is a clear example of driven votes from the Indian audience because like I said in the title, this movie is just mediocre.Luckily no unnecessary indian music is added to the story.
The acting is poor, really poor.
The plot is just okay with an ending that is just so messed up.I could've voted the title ""1"" to downvote it but I gave it a fair ""5"" vote. Hope Indian audience can give fairer votes and not just ""10"" to every movie because it's an Indian movie. This one doesnt' belong in the top 250 list of best movie in the world of all time. No Way",Andhadhun
331,robinsonjeyaraj,Good Screenplay but away from reality,8,1 January 2019,Story and screenplay are good but the story is very much away from reality. Police are shown like dummies.

The title actually does justice to the whole story line ""Andha = Blind"" and ""Dhun= Tune/ Melody"" and both of these things are the core features of this film.

In first half its a feel good film and in the second half you get to see what sreeram sir is famous for ""thril"". Though this movie has lots of silent spaces between scenes in second half but you never get bored as you are so much engaged in this movie and it never lets you get bored. Please watch and make these kind of movies the biggest hits so that Indian film industry makes more of this kind of cinema.
You won't regret it and you will fall in love with Ayushmann's acting, what a great actor he is and always chooses the unconventional but entertaining scripts.
This movie is the perfect balance between indie and commercial cinema as it has both, great acting by fine actors and perfect movie masala.",Andhadhun

337,prav00784,Andhadhun: The worst part of the movie is that it ends.,8,3 December 2018,"ANDHADHUN7/10DIRECTOR: SRIRAM RAGHAVANACTORS: TABU, AAYUSHMAN KHURRANA, RADHIKA APTEWRITERS: SRIRAM RAGHAVAN, ARIJIT BISWAS, POOJA LADHA SURTI, YOGESH CHANDEKAR, HEMANTH RAOMUSIC: AMIT TRIVEDICINEMATOGRAPHY: K. U MOHANANA joyous ride of a thriller and dark humor with a confusing tale of crime and bluffs which you should definitely get on.The worst part of Andhadhun is that it ends!Sriram Raghavan might have risen to fame with Andhadhun but he started off with a National Award for his Diploma project, The Eight Column Affair. The extremely talented director has been overlooked numerous times in his directorial ventures. He has directed a documentary about the infamous serial killer Raman Raghav and feature-length films Ek Hasina Thi, Johnny Gaddar and Badlapur. The underrated piece, Johnny Gaddar, by Raghavan has similar notions of Andhadhun. Having watched all his works, I was somewhat prepared for the confusing tale and the twists before going into the movie first hand.Andhadhun is a well-crafted crime thriller with the flow of crimes which are well connected for creating enough twists and turns. The film has nuances of Cohen brothers and Sexy Beast in Particular but still manages to be original. The scene starts off with a hare running around and then cuts to the present time. In the end, the same opening scene is intertwined with the ongoing drama in Akash's (Aayushman Kurrana) life. This particular theme is inspired by Sexy Beast, a British movie starring Ben Kingsley where Ben Kingsley's character is somewhat of Tabu's character and Ray Winstone's can be replaced by Aayushman's. Despite the similarity in the theme, the content is totally different and this is the very fact that made me like Andhadhun equally as I liked Sexy Beast.Andhadhun has also credited the French gem of a short movie, The Piano Tuner, as its inspiration. They have few shots inspired too and somewhat of the plot but the elaborate illustrations of the theme are just mind-boggling.Keeping in mind that I cannot reveal much to keep this review spoiler free, above all the spoilers, if it is so. Till now I have only talked about the inspirations and the tone of the movie.The star cast ensemble is more than you could ask for. Tabu has given an awesome performance as always and Aayushman and Radhika are also quite amazing. Talking about the performance is a waste of time as it has been nailed very well.Huge thanks to Anurag Kashyap, Amit Trivedi, the gem of Hindi Music Industry has risen to such a fame that he gets lots of movies to entertain us. The music is the kind that you need for the movie. Amit Trivedi is always able to create music which contributes to the content in all possible ways.The movie is filled with events that lead to next without much confusion but when it ends, everything is questionable. It is very much confusing after you have done watching as there is no clear conclusion that the movie offers. You can derive your own conclusions but what is the fun in that. The ending makes it even more exciting as you are left with plenty of questions and answers. The answers you have can be different from others and everyone is correct because that is what the film tends to do to you.",Andhadhun

344,salmanwahed,The rating for this movie is delusive.,3,26 November 2019,Warning: DO NOT TRUST THE RATINGS OF AN INDIAN MOVIEThis movie had a 8.4 rating while I was watching. It's surprisingly overrated! It has a lot of plot twists but random and confusing. The different characters hardly connects with each other. So there are many questions that remained unanswered. Why the main protagonist was acting as a blind man? What happened to the police stuck in the elevator? After everything the hero just got into a bus and then traveled to Europe and became a successful musician? How did he managed all the money? What happened to the multiple murder cases? There are many more. And the story is so wacky that I don't even want to write on it. This movie is a waste of time.,Andhadhun

Lets begin with the story. It was something new and screenplay was perfect with its occasional twists and turns.The comedy one liners were also good. The climax will surely blow your mind.
The songs were soo soothing, especially 'Wo ladki' in the climax was soo melodious and touching. 'Naina da kya Kasoor' was also good one and one of my favourites. The camera and editing was soo good.
If you are a fan of thrillers or atleast if you are a movie goer, you must definitely watch this masterpeiece.

358,suprabh,Rabbit or Duck? Ending Explained.,10,22 December 2018,"Many have reviewed Andhadhun and rated it highly and I am no different. I found it pretty damn entertaining myself. Following is just a review of the ending and how enriching that experience was for me as an audience. Hope you all like it.Watched Andhadhun again today. I never made a post about its ending the first time because I liked the Director's version of the open ending and leaving it up to the audience's interpretation.However, when I watched it again today, I realized that the film does not have any open ending if you carefully observe it.Before I go into the meaning of the ending we have to understand the phenomena of Rabbit or Duck illusion. Google ""Rabbit or duck"" for the image and the reference for rest of my review.For decades now, the Rabbit or Duck illusion has been presented as a test for level of creativity. What you notice in the image determines what part in your brain is more active. A lot of people look at Duck only, Some people see Rabbit only and some see both.Of course you can see both if you know that it's an illusion and you pay way too much attention to it and if you try to look for it.However, the real trick is (and this is the next level - not part of the original illusion but something that Raghavan has done here), that what if there is no illusion? But being used to the concept of illusion, we are forced to look for both Rabbit and the Duck.Andhadhun - There is no duck. It's only a rabbit.In the last scene of the movie, the waitress from the Restaurant comes outside and gives Ayushman his cane back. This Cane has a Rabbit at its handle (Raghavan starts his Rabbit/Duck illusion here)The movie begins with Ayushman's voice telling Radhika - ""bahut lambi kahaani hai.... Coffee? - It's a very long story...Coffee?"" (This line is repeated towards the end and that's how the audience know, that Ayushman is telling the story of his life to Radhika)But interestingly, the story telling takes a pause right towards the climax (when Ayushman and Doctor in the story are driving off)...the scene cuts to London and Radhika says - ""Aur phir? (and then?)""This is sort of the writer's way of writing an Epilogue solely to ""create the illusion of creating an illusion"". In the Epilogue story, where Ayushman tells the story of Tabu's accident and how the rabbit jumped and caused the accident - there are only 2 souls that can know about the Rabbit. 1- Tabu (who was distracted) and 2- Rabbit (because it caused the distraction)...Even Ayushman won't know because he was blind. So very clearly, Raghavan tells you that Ayushman is simply bluffing in this final piece.Now some may say that the shooter also saw the rabbit and he could have come and told Ayushmaan (blah, blah) - but I am basing my explanation on what is shown. Not on, what is not shown and is pure conjecture.Here is one more thing - Tabu dying would have been a bigger piece of Info which Radhika would already be aware of since the case was such a high profile one, but she seems to get all this info first hand from Ayushman, completely oblivious of Tabu's whereabouts until that moment.So Raghavan very cleverly tells the truth, but by that time- we the audience are so trapped in this brilliant tale of our hearts wanting to continue in the suspense, that we want to believe there is an illusion for sure.Raghavan even more clearly tells it very loud and clear that there is no illusion- by having Ayushman's cane with a Rabbit(or duck) handle, clearly saying- that Ayushman is selling the illusion because he has no way of validating the presence of Rabbit but he is telling that in his story.It is absolutely a delightful way of gripping your audience by having them look for things that they invent as they go.Adhadhundh (the original word not the movie title - notice the spelling difference) - basically means, something that happens extremely fast and recklessly without any validation or thought - Exactly what the ending is.Fantastic!",Andhadhun

360,zoe_su,Some of my records,9,13 March 2020,"I watched the movie twice, the first time, I was startled, for the second time, in spite of the psychological preparation, I still made a nightmare in the evening, I dare not to think of myself as the hero, in which, especially kidney cut scene, and police to test whether he really blind, as well as the woman cruelly pushed the old lady down the balcony, my god, it was too scary. This movie is really disgusting. The first half hour of it made me feel like I was watching a romance movie. But suddenly it became horrible.In fact, I have been thinking a question, the hero is absolutely lying, so what is the real truth?",Andhadhun
361,suresh-vinay,Bollywood scores again,9,21 October 2018,"No spoilers. There is a lot of drama and comedy when the protagonist is blind. The expressions of other characters are highlighted . Last time I enjoyed the same was Aankhen (AB, Akshay , Arjun, Paresh). Amazing acting by everyone. Superb story. Even the smallest role of the cabbage farmer was perfect. Just one small inconclusion about the person in the lift remains, but that doesn't matter when we sum up the movie. Do not miss the minute details else you will be guessing what was the actual conclusion. There is just one version of the ending. And the hint is right there in the movie's trailer too.

363,timusathem28,Refreshing concept but not perfect,8,26 December 2018,"This was a very engaging and entertaining movie, peppered with great acting performances.But the concept is borrowed from a French short film, which I watched and it serves as an interesting benchmark for the strength of Andhadhun's storyline. And I would say while Raghavan has done a great job of converting the premise into a full length film, lots of holes remain. It's bizarre of Tabu to open the door to him in the first place, (in the original short film the pianist says ""I'm blind"" so she opens the door, where as here she asks him way later). Apte's character is used quite wastefully and she's missing through most of the movie. After Tabu makes up the fanciful story of Ayushmann being her lover, I would have thought the natural conclusion would be that the police go after him as he's now the suspect. Instead there's no sign of the police.The whole plot is fanciful and not very well thought out.So overall this movie fell quite short of perfection.",Andhadhun

Shriram Raghavan weaves the plot like a master weaver.. not a single mm to the left or right. But I on a personal note would like to give the credit of the success of this movie to The brilliant star cast of the movie. Aayushman Khurana plays the role of the blind pianist to the ""t"", Radhika Apte is modern indian cinema's definition of ' perfection '. Veteran actors like Anil Dhavan & Tabbu are so efficient in adapting to the characters assigned to them. But on the whole the credit goes to an amazing performance by ""Aayushman Khurana"" under the direction of 'Sriram Raghavan'.

413,DiwakarAPPal,Andhadhun - an excellent and hilarious dark comedy,8,8 October 2018,"Another gem from Shriram Raghavan, Andhadhun is rib-tickling, edgy and subtle. The narrative is smooth, and exposes the naked humanity whenever surrounded by fear, lust and greed.I happened to recall ""Urf Professor"" from Late Pankaj Advani's kitty, at several moments towards the climax, maybe because that was the first bollywood dark comedy I had watched and cherish. Andhadhun certainly shall be remembered as one of the finest of this genre.As the name suggests, an important component of the movie is its background score, and the usage of nostalgic tunes to weave the narration with a pattern that entangles and unfolds the minds of the audience at the right moments. Hats off to Amit Trivedi for that. I would especially laud the moment Beethoven's symphony is introduced. The songs & music are just average, and has been fitted in the story line as and when required. Tabu and Ayushman lead from the centre, supported well by all characters around them. Ayushman is fluently cheeky throughout, and Tabu is a little metro-progressive version of her characters in Haider and Fitoor. She has definitely mastered the art of capturing the heart of the flicks she is a part of. Radhika Apte has little to do, so no blame on her. She does her part well. Support cast of Ashwini Kalsekar, Manav Vij, Anil Dhawan, Zakir Hussain and Chhaya Kadam do full justice to their characters. Manav Vij is especially good as the nervous SHO, and Zakir Hussain convinces as the dishonest Doctor. Saying anything more will spill spoilers, and so I will abstain!

Of course it Does , people who have watched Usual Suspect will surely know what i want to convey. There are some elements (keypoints ) in a film that u have to remember to understand what does a director want to convey and this film have does element but they are tangled in such a way that different viewer will come up with their own idea to satisfy their doubt about this movie.. since it has multiple conclusion...
And as for my title this is OVERRATED for those who will have hard to digest the plot and keywords and MASTERPIECE for those who understand all the elements

476,e-08639-78017,14 twists analyzed,9,27 August 2019,"What happens to the only witness of a crime scene if he's visually impaired?
What happens, if he's only pretending he can't see?
Andhadhun has an astounding abundance of twists and turns, even by the standards of a suspense movie. The first twist is when we discover Akash, the pianist, is only pretending to be blind so he can have a keener perception of sounds and music.
The second twist comes when Akash is playing the piano for Simi, the former movie star Pramod's wife, under the guise of a blind pianist. He sees Pramod lying dead on the floor, his killer hiding in the bathroom, and the entire process of Simi and the murderer smuggling the body out of the house in a purple suitcase.
The third is when Akash tries to report the case to the police but discovers that the officer is actually the perpetrator. He holds his tongue, even if he wishes to bravely tell the truth.
The fourth is when Akash witnesses Simi shoving her neighbor, who holds the truth of Pramod's murder, over the railings, letting the old lady fall to her death.
The fifth is when Simi visits Akash, adding poison to his food and turning him blind for real.
The sixth is when the officer(murderer) enters Akash's apartment at night and tries to strangle him, but miraculously, Akash escapes.
The seventh is when the doctor and the woman who saves Akash reveals that their real intension is to kill him and remove his liver.
The eighth is when Akash persuades his captors to work with him to blackmail the officer and kidnap Simi.
The ninth is when Akash's accomplices turn against him and bind him to a wheelchair.
The tenth is when the doctor and Akash lock Simi up into the car boot and conspire to kill her instead. The doctor will take her liver to save his daughter, and Akash will take her corneas to repair his eyes.
The eleventh is when Simi attacks the doctor when he opens the car boot to check on her.
The twelfth is when Akash tells Simi, whom he thinks is the doctor, that he thinks it's immoral to kill her and doesn't want to do it anymore. Simi lets him down the car, and tries to run him over.
The thirteenth is when the blind bunny with glossy eyes, who appeared at the beginning of the film, bounces onto the car window when the hunter fires at it. Simi loses control of the car, and crashes off the road, killing herself in the process. Akash survives, and so does the rabbit.
The fourteenth is when two years later, after a performance, Akash walks the street with a cane, and strikes a can on the pavement with stunning accuracy.
A truly troubling story.
Apparently Akash regained his eyesight. Then what of the bunny, and Simi's death? My theory is that Akash made everything up since the eleventh twist because he wanted to hide the horrifying truth that he and the doctor did exactly what they planned to do. But there's more.
Remember in the third twist, when Akash imagined himself standing up bravely and revealing the truth? A part of him wished he was a good man who chose justice over his own safety. He wanted to see Simi and the officer punished for their sins, wanted to be valiant enough to lay out the real story, but he didn't. Fear won over conscience, and he chose silence.
Back to the eleventh twist. I think it's not just a story Akash fed to others so they would believe he was innocent. It is also what Akash wished would have happened, things Akash hoped he would've done, thought he should've done. He imagined his sudden mercy and his confession to be honorable; he imagined the bunny killed Simi instead of him. He imagined all of it, the way he imagined that he told the truth in the third twist. It's a lie told more to himself than to the others, to placate himself, to ease his own guilt.
But in the end he chose silence. Again. That's how he got his eyes back.
The bunny represented him, I think. Blind, and responsible for Simi's death.
That's what really makes the ending poignant, I suppose. Akash wanted to be good and honest and kind, but these vile and selfish people scared him. So to protect himself, he smartly shut up, and became just like them.
Another question kept bugging me, though. If the blind bunny was Akash, who was the hunter, then?
For that, I have two theories. One is that the hunter was Simi, the officer, the doctor and the woman. All of them had wanted him dead at some point, but somehow he'd gotten away. When the last shot fired-which stood for the agreement between Akash and the doctor-the bunny leapt up, and killed the Simi in the car.
The second theory is that the hunter was Akash's conscience, and the bunny was Akash's dark, malevolent side. His conscience urged him to destroy that side, to do others no harm, but the shot missed, leaving his vengeful aspect unscathed and ready to strike.
Personally I'm more inclined to the second theory. In the fourteenth twist, if you look carefully you'll notice that the hilt of the cane was shaped like a bunny's head. In the end Akash stayed a pianist who faked his blindness, but it was more for money and the audience's pity than really feeling the music. Akash turned into a cunning, deceitful man. He chose his dark side, and it's no coincidence that he held that cane.
What is life? It depends on the liver.
The liver. Akash, Simi, the officer, the doctor, the woman.
The liver. Simi's liver. Benefits.",Andhadhun

A few too many twists that eroded my suspension of disbelief.Don't get me wrong, it was quite an enjoyable experience in the cinema hall watching the ride along with everyone else trying to guess what happens next. I'd give the the first half 8.5 stars if I could. I felt let down by the execution of the climax.Great acting by the cast, well shot, well made, good soundtrack and Pune looks great in this film.

ANDHADHUN by SRIRAM RAGHAVAN and co. is such a fantastic piece of cinema, it made me totally ignore my cellphone in anticipation of the thrill the next frame will bring about. The script is so deliciously twisted, it makes you wonder about that thin line between right and wrong.
The fab actors totally nailed their grey-black-white-colourful characters which are so so well written. The very cinematically suave Mr. Raghavan along with his DOP and screen writers totally hit this one out of the park. His fascination for Pune adds to the charm and the end result is one incredible, jaw dropping suspense thriller, served SRIRAM RAGHAVAN style; cold, heart wrenching and in your face.

I believe, Tabu has overshadowed Ayushmann with her impeccable acting. Taking nothing away from Ayushmann, he was flawless in his performance. Radhika Apte was underused but it is because script demanded that. In second half, I started to get a feel that director is stretching too far with two parallel plots but eventually everything was folded well. Must watch if you like Dark Cinema.",Andhadhun

2) if he went blind, how did he land in Europe?
3) did he went through cornea transplant?
4) did pianist leveraged any plans of doctor to sell simi's organ to a seikh?
4) at end is there any link between murli, mausi and pianist for transplant? as mausi had pianist passport and murli died and was suggested for his organ donation by a nurse.or the pianist is lying througout of him being blind.

542,raoomkar,Please make more movies like this,10,7 October 2018,Sriram raghavan known for his love of dark stories proved yet again of how capable bollywood is in producing movies in the dark genre. The movie is not what the trailer shows to be apart from the murder which isnt even the important part of the story. Exactly thats the beauty of this movie death not being the centre of attraction on which a lot of movies are made. The very intricate type of story. Ayushmann Khurrana did a great job switiching characters. Tabu was lovely and did justice to the role. The movie does have only a 2-3 expected moments rest of the film is complete surprise. The deaths in the movie are too natural and some are even the funniest scenes of the film. Not your regular black comedy film and a must watch for sure.

It'd be a great tragedy if this movie goes down as an underrated flick. It deserves all the positives in it's way. I'll never forget this gem of a movie!

Off late it has shredded off the image of Fantasy Heros with fantasy story, now it is story telling of real lives and which can be felt by each and every viewer.Andhandhun is a edge of seat - dark - suspense & intense movie, those expecting it to be a regular masala film kindly avoid it. It is a purely a Black Comedy Thriller. This movie has many twists and turns and again twists and again turns but yes they all are unpredictable. Yes that is the best part of story telling and that is what Mr. Sriram Raghavan loves to do with his movies, be it Johnny Gaddar, Agent Vinod or Badlapur.The experimental blind man played by Aayushman is the best he could have ever asked for. Infact it is the author backed role given to him and has done complete justice to it. Whereas Tabu, what to say about her well she is getting wilder and extremely adventurous with her selection of roles. She is just outstanding and mind blowing in this movie. There are few character actors and they have done a good job, I only found Radhika Apte's role was not worth for her and is totally wasted in this movie.I hardly remember any movie whose first half was so intense and gripping. Even the the first murder scene is outstanding and it is worth watching on 70 mm rather than reading on a post on Facebook. Sriram Raghvan, salute to your for making such a wonderful and very very interesting movie.When you walk out of the theater you can hear conversation of public debating their own interpretation and trying to prove their logic and argument stronger than others and proudly claiming to decode this thriller. And this is the actual victory for making this film by Sriram.Go watch this movie for its brilliant narrative with ample punches of black comedy, you would be hooked on to your seat till end ..... Or it has still not ended

573,rashmisarkar-47992,Where Agatha Christie meets Robin Cook!,7,19 October 2018,"""Andha Dhun""-Review""Andha Dhun"" belongs to the noir genre and like Sriram Raghavan's movies is interesting but dark in spirit, background , lighting and humour.You have to be prepared for sudden twists and turns and shocks throughout.I find his movies a compelling watch but also somehow disturbing,as I did with this one.
Well,the movie has an interesting first half very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's plots complete with a blind pianist and a black and white cat,frequenting his bachelor's pad in Pune to complete the picture.It is immensely watchable.But for some reason I felt the second half which is Agatha Christie meets Robin Cook with the organ donation racket,largely meandering.You miss the excitement of the first half and a taut editing could have worked wonders.
What works for the movie based on a blind pianist becoming an accidental witness for a murder,is the apt casting.It is refreshing to watch Ayushman Khurana as only a blind person and for a change without any reproductive issues- he deserves to play the complete man too.Being a singer,he plays the perfect pianist and the flicker of rapid change in his facial expressions is a treat to watch.So is Tabu who has perfected the art of playing the deviant and her meanness and negativity without any remorse is chilling and stays with you long.Tabu has played this cunning and conniving widow in ""Maqbool"" and ""Hyder"" to perfection before .Radhika Apte ,as Ayushman's short-lived romantic interest,has a role which does not do her justice and could be done by any newcomer.
The surprise casting of Anil Dhawan as a yesteryear actor with a second wife,is a nice touch and plays homage to some nice songs of his from the 70's-""Annadaata"",""Honeymoon"",""Hawas"" and ""Samjhauta""- incidentally most of these had hummable melodies.Incidentally,I rather liked Anil Dhawan as a kid as he was perfectly soft and chocolatey and sad.This touch makes the movie relatable.Manav Vij as Tabu's romantic interest looks the perfect body builder type police inspector who is terrified of his wife,played brilliantly by Ashwini Kalsekar.
The doctor,the rickshwallah,lottery seller play their bits in this twisted web of deceit.As a thriller,""Andha Dhun"" is better than most movies of this genre .It is just that it needed a tighter second half in the same league as it's crisp first half.The movie is ironical in parts and makes you think.
You should go for it if you like the noir genre.I would go with three and a half stars.

Its complete nonsense.The last scene where a rabbit accidentally saves the main protagonist's life will resonate very well with Indian audiences.

The movie gets hold of you but lacks some Emotions at some places, but you don't lose grip, given the Dark Comedy with Mystery and Suspense keeps you on your feet. No there are no Scenes that may stay with you for long but as a Whole, this is going to be with you.Talking about Acting, Everyone was just perfect and justified their roles. Praising particularly won't be the right thing to do. Music is soothing, even if you don't like it, those piano Melodies are going to haunt you.

He tells her that After sedating Pramod Kumar's wife the doctor promise Akash that he will sell her organs and as a reward of saving his(Doctor) life he will transplant her eyes and he will be able to see again. But, Akash requested the doctor not to kill her and said he doesn't want his eyesight back either. Suddenly, a sound comes from the car's boot. The doctor stopped the car and went to check what happened. """"""""""Then, you suddenly see a ""Hare"" beside the road."""""""""".
When he finished telling sofie the story then the waiter brought his stick which was also made up of hare design. Which meant his story after that is a lie. Besides, a blind persone can forget anything except his stick. Therefore, he transplanted her eye and sold out her organs.",Andhadhun

And you don't get any excitement till interval. The movie get some pace after interval. But they leave a suspense like shutter Island in last which is totally unnecessary.
So 7/10 is sufficient.",Andhadhun

595,sutirthabagchi-26979,"Very good movie - far, far better than the average",8,31 December 2018,"This is an exceptionally good movie that we watched on Christmas 2018. All six of us viewing this movie (and ranging in age from 35 to 68) found it absolutely gripping. Admittedly the first half was tighter than the second half and perhaps 20 minutes of the movie could have been cropped out without issue but even then, our final verdict is that the movie was very good. We spent about an hour the following day over lunch discussing the various loose ends and wondering if the director had left those open in order to make a sequel in the future. :) My strong recommendation is watch it if you would like to see a well-made Hindi thriller.",Andhadhun

loved Ayushman & Tabbu for such graceful & effortless acting, and all the supporting cast including Mr. Zakir Hussain loved him for his innocence greedy doctor he played with such ease.
Simple & Soothing music given by Amit Trivedi geld up so beautifully in the movie with such great pieces of piano, including that murder scene one.
I am not a big critic or film maker, saying all this stuff just as a simple audience, I personally did not like that Ayushman's singing voice was changing, sorry but it is the essential part of the movie.loved movie so much that it will be in my all time top ten movies of Bollywod

Movies normally fall into the following categories - Drama, Romance, Thriller, Action, Musical, Comedy. Each of these categories can be further categorized as Light, Dark, OVer the top.
Andhadhun for me cannot be categorized in one of the above types, it has established a category of it's own and master of that category is Sriram. Johnny Gaddar, Badlapur and now Andhadhun.
This is a movie you will go back and watch numerous times as each scene has some hidden easter eggs.This movie commemorates all actors - Tabu, Ayushman, Zakir Hussain, Raadhika Apte, Characters Murali, Sakku, 16 eggs eating Police Inspector..Watch the movie for what it is a noir of it's own.Enjoyed it thoroughly...",Andhadhun

603,eternalgracereiki,Great Creative Endeavor... Delivered the Promise,10,13 January 2019,"Movie is veey gripping with least flaws in every aspect. Here in goofs it is mentioned that Akash was never blind for more than few hours..that Bundu the boy saw him and his parents might have got his eyes treated...to me this is not coherent.If he was not blind he would not seek the auto rickshaw guy and his woman to help. It was by accident he was saved by them...Even if suppose he went to them for help...he wouldnt choose to stay in a shady abandoned hospital. He was smart enough to know whats happening and wouldnt wait till last moment to mention Shanker Bhagwan and hope that the trick works...Also he wanted money for his eye treatment...he didnt plan to take Simi's eyes as original plan...that he would go to an illegal organ dealing place...so that explanation to me is not correct.So rest of the movie he was blind but he tells Sophie an end that would keep his secret safe.
Some people are confused and think he was never blind in the entire movie...that would disrupt the plot.",Andhadhun
604,eternalgracereiki,Response to the Review Trading Logic for Twists,10,13 January 2019,Akash is doing an experiment of being blind. So how can you do it if you tell your family or friends..if he has any ?? He could be orphan or just struggling in a big city. Lot of people are all alone in real life as well. So no point in checking his background...he does say he is there for 3 months and rent is 500..so that explains.Second CCTV camera...its not shown if the building lobby has CCTV...most buildings have them at entrance not on every floor. So that can be ruled out.Yes Mrs Disa could have been killed by Simi inside her house. She could have Just strangled her...and Mrs Disa could be shown as having Asthma. That would have worked too.Simi leaves Akash because of two reasons...he is the witness who gave statement. If she kills him there can be suspucion. And second she confesses she is sick of killing people...shes not a serial killer. So this is also ruled out.The hospital is old hospital as doctor says another hospital is there near highway. If hes dealing in illegal organ trade ...he is using an old facility for this. He goes back to his home...because he says before leaving i will come tomorrow morning. Hes at his house as his son is shown...where nurse brings the report. Maybe he called her with report as it was another big deal if the blood matched... So this is also explained...I dont understand why these questions even came up. There is no logic lost ...atleast not in any major way...,Andhadhun

They don't care whose in the film they will watch any film which provides with pure content. With this advent bollywood filmmakers also need to up their game. And finally sriram raghavan an expert in delivering thrilling movies came up with this absolute masterpiece. You get consumed by the movie from the very beginning and the movie always keeps you guessing. All your predictions fail and you get surprised from every angle. It completely catches you off guard at many positions and believe me you'll be stunned. Moreover sriram raghvan's characterisation and screen writing is such that you cannot fully trust any character because they are terrible humans. From background score to direction and acting every thing is up to the mark. Ayushmann khurrana serves up the best performance of his career. Tabu as always plays his part brilliantly. Huge shootout to manav vij. The movie will keep you hooked and the best thing is the end which is open-ended and one of the most debatable endings after inception.,Andhadhun

To give it a feel of old time suspense thrillers, Raghvan has thrown in Anil Dhawan in a cameo. With him, many of hit songs from his movies are brilliantly used.
The movie keeps you guessing even after it ends, and that is the beauty of story telling. The only downside is that the director has made few situations over-comical and that takes out the fun. However, this movie is a beauty in its genere.",Andhadhun

627,mehedihasan-98348,A terrific game of blind man's bluff.,9,17 September 2020,"Honestly, I don't even know how to start reviewing this movie. The only way I can explain it is by a sitcom, fantasy and suspense, music and adventure. Would it sound like a ridiculously crazy thing? It's well. Things go awry after a series of exposes and doubles leading to a third case that is so extravagantly convulsed, that in reality it is rather fantastic. Andhadhun is based on the blind pianist who witnesses a lethal crimes and is obligated to report them to the government. Am I sufficiently ambiguous to you? The soap opera, inspired by Fargo and directed by Quentin Tarantino, in the vein of the pulp of fiction, is like a rush from La Land & Seven Pounds. I was looking forward to being a fan of Raghavan movies, and I enjoyed them tremendously, even though I saw The Tuner for Piano. It's a great screenplay. The writers' team n the boss has done a great job by translating a short movie into a film. The script would not relax anxious hold. There are endless obstacles to sacrifice the heart of a short film when making it a video, but Andhadhun 's creators have really managed to pave the groundwork for potential talent. It's noisy, funny and quite entertaining when it comes back to this picture. It's well paced and funny and has a black sense of humor. You can not remain comfortable in your chair during this film experience. Authors knit a complete Mystery pitch: murdering, money & dumb. Dumb. Cinematography is all that boasts the narrative. Piano scenes are superbly crafted and choreographic, emphasized in the music of Amit Trivedi and in Daniel B George's background score. Couple of songs with a romantic touch and a tribute to Chayahar and Chitrage score. Adapted screenplay and black comic story by Raghavan She shows her class to Tabu. Ayushman gives the best career. This film is a prime example of how a nail-consuming suspense can be told in a funny way. The narrative of the film appears to be usual, but as the film progresses, you will come to recognize that this movie is more than just a standard thriller. A fine script and writing with a blend of music and black humour, and before being shocked, keep your imagination horses on. Just do a favor, and watch it, it's unavoidable. Just let it hit you rough, don't say a thing about the film, it's better if you don't know anything about it and just watch it and get blown away from it. This will be the best 140 minutes you'll spend in a movie without spoiling the movie for you all. A dark comedy and a thriller of suspense.",Andhadhun

All praise to the makers for taking the unexplored route and attempting something new. Ayushman is impressive, he surprised me with his range of acting. Tabu is fantastic as always but I feel she did not get enough opportunity to deliver her range of acting. Other actors are very effective. I did notice some instances where things could have been done well. I noticed some shots which looked casual and a few moments where the writing look lazy in an otherwise immaculate film. I am ready to ignore these lapses. All in all it is high on entertainment value (but leaves you hungry for a lack of proper closure). A must watch for Indian audiences.

669,gouravsutar,Restored my faith in bollywood.,10,17 December 2018,"I generally don't watch Bollywood movies since most of them are lacklustre , illogical and filled with horrendous remixed songs. Few friends of mine had watched this movie and recommended me the same. The director's previous two movies weren't that good so I was sceptical at first.Watched it on Netflix and was really impressed. The movie was nearly perfect and the cast was perfect; the acting , the body language, the screenplay, the background score , you name it.
I am not a big fan of Radhika Apte and Aysuhmann Khurana but this movie really changed my views on them. Tabu was as usual great. The supporting actors like the doctor were also fantastic. Overall this movie is a must watch and I am looking forward to movies like this in the near future.",Andhadhun

Isn't account maintained for every bullet used out of officer's pistol.Even if it was not service revolver, it must his personal licensed pistol - still it could be tracked.
(serial numbers on bullets)
Being a police inspector, I am assuming he won't be carrying any illegal weapon. Also they were not there for planned killing so more chances of murder weapon being his service revolver.And as body was found in in suitcase only,no harm was done to body by crocodiles either,so bullet was intact",Andhadhun

The trailer was so nicely edited so that you don't know how crazy the movie is going to be!!In the entire movie you don't know where it is heading , well talking of screenplay is so awesome , the scene similar to Agent Vinod ,where the song rabtaa is played with a piano player playing and shootout in the background was so awesome.
Few parts i thought were too dragging , they could have been edited. That was the only fault in the movie.
Everything , everyone, everyshot taken was mind blowing 
Aayushman Khuranaa's best performance till date , Tabbu as she has been just awsome which is expected from her. Radhika Apte s Character had not much of potential as far as her variety is concerned , the character could have been played by any other person. Although she did well.
Now finally the best part of the movie, the ending which has made the movie just brilliant. the ending will keep your mind into multiple thoughts , what actually happened. the director and the writer has to be given credit here, they just didn't end the movie by their perception but made us to think and consider which perspective we want to believe and agree!

Thanks to performances by Ayushmaan Khuran and Tabbu who made it even intriguing. Tabbu in grey shade is like never seen before. All in all its a rare type of movie in bollywood.,Andhadhun

767,dreamerganesh,An edge of the seat thriller,10,16 December 2018,"Movie Name : Andhadhun
A blind man unintentionally lands in the murder scene, what happens next will keep you thrilled throughout the movie.
The best Indian movie of year 2018 as per IMDb which beats Ratsasan to get the No. 1 position.
It is an edge of the seat thriller where you don't even get a chance to guess what happens next.
Hats off to the Dir Sriram Raghavan for the mind blowing story and the fantastic & thrilling screenplay
Marvelous acting by Ayushmann Khurrana and Tabu, especially Ayush where he brilliantly portrays the blind pianist...
Lovely and entertaining songs and also wonderful background score which really helps the movie to get going and thrill you more...
Overall one of the best Indian films of 2018..
A must watch movie if you are a fan of thriller movies.

793,sdppriyadarshi,Starting of the movie tell the real ending of the movie.,9,21 June 2019,"""What is life
It depends on the liver""
This is the line which appeared in the starting of the movie when Ayushman said that-kahani bahut lambi, coffee.I think that Raghavan tried to tell a different ending from Akash's illusionary plot,actually it's a puzzle.This puzzle can solved by two things first one is above quoted line and another one is cane ,has the handle of rabbit.Both are good examples of the pun.
Raghavan told that in actually ,the protagonist, Akash accepted the doctor's offer of selling Simi's liver (the word in the starting line of the movie) to the Shekh and in return he got money by which he operated his 'non blind' eyes.The rabbit is the symbolism of speed who is fast in recognizing opportunities that will get him closer to his goals, who just miss from the deadly bullet and these whole fits perfectly for the character of Akash.",Andhadhun

+Points 
1. The start was amazing 
2. Character placements and casting was phenomenal 
3. Uncountable twists and turns till interval will make you tied with your seat
4. Lovely piano background score 
5. Superb acting by each and every character points1. Some slower parts after 
interval 
2. Illogical violence in the last 15 minutes 
3. Characters seems confusing by the ending scenes of movie
4. It leaves you with some questions after the movie get over
However, overall the movie was brilliant, cinematographically was outstanding.!! I am a big fan of Sriram Raghavan and his brilliance proved again. Definitely enjoyable as said above around 85% of runtime..",Andhadhun
796,bajajrachit-77272,BEST THRILLER FILM OF THIS DECADE,10,9 October 2018,"Dont miss this movie, its a must watch. And it will be your best experience watching this in the theater.",Andhadhun
797,ashishvaishnav-85689,Befitting the title - Andhadhun,9,6 October 2018,"One of the best movies I've seen in the theater. It almost never lets its grip off you and successfully makes you laugh. Music given by Amit Trivedi is outstanding. There are scenes which only progress through the music (especially of Piano). It is brilliance from the director Shriram Raghavan's part, too. When Simi and Manohar was cleaning the wine and blood, and clearing Pramod's body from the hall, just see how the music of piano played by Akash is changing. It is quite in sync with the expressions of Simi and Manohar. And it is not the only one example, it is displayed throughout the movie ant many places. Surely, the fact that the protagonist playing piano is used judiciously.The acting of all the three characters were very good. At the very last, you feel true disgust for Simi who tried to kill Akash even after he argued for her with the doctor.My only complaint is with Sophie and Manohar's character. On the one hand where the character of Sophie wasn't explored more and on the other, Manohar's character looked weak to me as an inspector. But all and all, the movie is befitting the title - Andhadhun. Everything happening on the screen was Andhadhun. A must watch movie I'd say. Ayushmann... take a bow!",Andhadhun
798,shreyansranka,What a delivery! Brilliance - served strong!!!,10,6 October 2018,"Such an interesting intriguing piece of work. Am a die hard Bollywood fan, have a habit of multiple viewing of movies, and yet after all these years, this is the one which compelled and pulled me to writing my first review. Sheer brilliant effort from the actors, writers, filming & photography team - everyone! Still searching for a soul that has felt otherwise after seeing this, and I bet I can debate them out of their counter views, if any. Well made, well done, must, must, must watch. Would want to see this end up being a global blockbuster, but for now it's already one for me!",Andhadhun

This movie will keep you active all along from the start and keeps you engaging every moment of it. It's a thrill ride with many great turns and all the characters are so well developed and portrayed. It has all the mystery, drama, thriller and suspense that one looks for. It has a good piano play as well throughout, you would really like it if you're a true music lover. The content is very encouraging. Thanks to all the writers of the movie really appreciate their work in this!",Andhadhun
800,varshneysiddhant,A genius on blind.,10,6 October 2018,"This is something extraordinary given by both the actors as well as the directors(including the music as well) which has compelled me to write this . Taboo as the wife of a celebrity and Ayushmann as a blind man( though you later find out whether he really was or not) being at centre did a fabulous job, that never let you shift your focus from screen even if you are with your gf or having homophobic inclinations . It is a true blockbuster in every sense and could pave the way for others to invest time in such kind of stories rather than falling in the trap of love stories.Guys do watch it once for their splendid efforts , you wouldn't find a single reason to dislike it.😊👍",Andhadhun

825,ashutoshcric,Movie of the year 2018,10,10 October 2018,"Ever since I started watching Hollywood films, there was always a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction from Hindi film industry. Sure, a few of the films here and there do make there mark on audiences like us, but they are pretty rare. 
So when I overheard a few people discussing various theories and plots, as I normally did after watching movies like Inception, Shutter Island, Fight Club, it warmed my heart to say the least.Coming to the movie, the plot is simple. A blind pianist gets involved in a murder scene and then starts a series of events that keeps us hanging on the edge of our seats. What I liked the most was the way all the chaos in foreground was soaked in beautiful piano pieces in background to deliver an immersive experience. Every character in the film has their secret and dark side. However the way it has been portrayed, you would be chuckling and even clapping where one shouldn't be. Each and every character has played their role perfectly. The musical experience is second to none, and keeps the story moving forward at brisk pace.Hats of to the director for delivering such a masterpiece, crafted with love and passion.Go watch it if you haven't already!",Andhadhun

I've watched many Classic Hollywood mystery thrillers like Se7en, the usual suspects, inception, shimmer lake, pulp fiction, mystic river, shutter Island etc. I'm not saying that the movie - Andhadhun, matches the quality of these movies, but certainly it's an outcome of a brave step taken by Mr. Sriram Raghavan, to make a bollywood movie which is not utterly over-dependent on emotions and melodrama,but relies on a strong script and power-packed performances..Andhadhun is a treat to watch, not just because it has all the ingredients of an ideal mystery thriller, but also because the story will keep you guessing right till the end..All the actors and actresses have evolved through the years, which is evident from their acting skills portrayed in the movie, especially Tabu..she has come a long way from her role in Haider and has once again shown that she can carry negative roles reay very well !Overall, I would say that the movie is a must watch !! Hope it goes a long way in developing an appetite for crisp mystery thrillers in Indian audiences.",Andhadhun

868,arnob-216,"Hilarious, with plot holes, good and bad twists, awesome acting!!",7,19 December 2018,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was hilarious, had many shocking moments but also contained many plot holes. The movie was directed very well so you might not notice some of the plotholes until you are finished with the movie and you start thinking.
Anyway, things I liked about the movie:1) Pace. After the 1st 30 minutes or so, it received insane amount of pace.
2) Acting. Superb.
3) Twists. It had lot of twists, some were even jaw dropping.
4) Comedy. I lauged at many parts. Comedy was handled in a great manner.
Overall a great cinematic experience I would say. And from a bollywood standard only, I would give it 8/10.Now the negatives:
1) Some twists were very forced. After the 1st jaw dropping moment, the quality of twists was falling. Some were even ridiculous.
2) It had many severe plot holes. It sometimes felt like the makers wanted a specific thing to happen in the movie and they made it happen without thinking if it would be logical or not.
3) They tried Christopher Nolan style open ending but to me it was totally unnecessary. The movie actually ended for me at the rabit scenes (if you know what I mean).I would suggest this movie to many people but I will choose the audience carefully. Many hollywood/Korean movie lovers might actually get pissed at the major flaws of the movie.",Andhadhun

874,argsaboo,Gobsmackingly Brilliant! First rate thriller!,10,22 December 2018,"Poetic justice. Divine Providence. Blind Rabbits. That in a nutshell, is what Andhadhun revolves around... an ingenious, nailbiting and pulsating black comedy directed by the maestro of thrillers Sriram Raghavan (who previously directed absolute gems like Johnny Gaddaar, Badlapur). The kind of film both, the Coen brothers and Manmohan Desai would be proud of.It begins innocently enough with Ayushmann Khurrana (in his career best performance) playing Akash, a piano player who just happens to be blind. We see him go about his business, interacting with the hoi polloi, complaining about over-affectionate aunties who 'touch' him inappropriately when he is giving their kids piano lessons, boasting about the rent of his apartment (""only 500 rupees per month"") and generally leading a harmless, squeaky clean life...that is until he bumps into (literally) someone, who introduces him to someone else and things just spiral out of control. Saying anything else would tantamount to sacrilege. Suffice it to say that from this point onwards, there is murder. There is betrayal. There are icy cold killers. There are cats running atop a piano. And there are laughs. Plenty of laughs. Which is weird, because the politically correct reaction one must elicit in such circumstances is bewilderment. Which is not to say, that we, the audience will not be. Shock and awe would be accompanied with chortles and giggles in equal measure. Bravo, Sriram Raghavan! Masterfully done. Every plot twist no matter how bizarre it may seem, somehow makes complete sense. And because its directed by Mr. Raghavan, the treatment is super slick and stylish. Andhadhun is a sexy, sexy film. The background music and the cinematography complementing the narrative like no other. This film by Sriram Raghavan is closer in spirit to his other stellar thriller, Johnny Gaddaar, reeking of the same retro coolth. Man! By the time the lights in the theater came on, my head was clearly blown off its shoulders! Watch it. Best Hindi Film of 2018, by far.",Andhadhun

882,prambee,Quirky Movie. Quirky Tribute. It's a Ripper,9,24 January 2019,"Too late for the party. There has been a deluge of hosannas for this movie, that made me lose Intrest in watching it in a conventional manner.So I took a quirky and raghavenseque way to compensate. Partly so , as a tribute to his earlier works. I skipped watching the movie and read the downloaded script start to finish.And boy. It was better than watching the movie, I tell ya. What deliciously evil characters. Simi will go down as one of the most stunning villains in Indian movie history. It was a treat to my senses to imagine how Tabu would've played her. Can totally imagine Ayushmann as a piano player tragically forced to living his own lie. The stumped Sophie left hanging between Akash's version in the end is a stylish prank on the viewer/reader, which is what an intelligent narrative is all about.Rest all characters add up to the madness and mayhem in a measured and appropriate way. Esp Anil Dhawan as Pramod Sinha is a master stroke, imagining his portrayal as I read made the music and bgm (my mind, my version) come out in my head.Tailpiece : This script reading session is my kind of revenge to my family who made so much conversation when this movie came on TV and I couldn't get myself to watch it beyond the first rabbit scene. I switched TV off. This seems perfect payback to them and enjoy the storytelling uninterrupted with an interval break to boot ;)Raghavan Sir - here is eagerly waiting doe your next.",Andhadhun
