0,SnoopyStyle,disturbing,7,19 August 2019,"Georg, his wife Anna, and their son Georgie arrive at their lakeside vacation house. Two young men named Peter and Paul claim to be neighbors come for a visit. The situation deteriorates as the young men take the family prisoners.The moment when Paul makes that bet is when the movie descends into hell. That's the moment when he turns to audience to break down the 4th wall. By directly talking to us, he makes us accomplices to their crime. It is a movie that refuses to have any happy ending. It is a way to torture the audience. That's why it is disturbing. It is actually bringing us into the movie and playing games with our minds. We may as well be tied up on that couch.",Funny Games
1,Horst_In_Translation,Gripping psychological horror movie,8,27 September 2015,"""Funny Games"" is an Austrian 110-minute movie from almost 20 years ago. It was written and directed by Michael Haneke and is a prime example of his work, which gives us an insight into the dark abyss of human behavior and, as in many of his other works, there will be no happy ending. It's interesting how Haneke plays with the audience when, at the end, it is mentioned that one of the two is not able to swim and they are on a boat, so maybe will he drown and there will be some comfort at least for the viewer? Nope. But back to the beginning. We have a couple and their son and the two get kidnapped by a duo of psychopaths. After a short introduction, this film is at least 90 minutes of physical and emotional torture. This film is certainly very tough to watch and even if I thought it was a really tense, gripping and well-made work, I have no intention of seeing it anytime soon again.Haneke worked with some actors here that he has worked with in the past already. For me, it was particularly difficult to watch this movie knowing about the untimely deaths of Mühe, Lothar (Mühe's wife actually) and Giering. Only Arno Frisch is still alive from the core cast. Well.. the child actor is as well, but he is not working in film anymore, has not appeared in a single film in the new millennium. It is not uncommon at all that Haneke's cast does include only a very limited amount of actors and I like that. It helps me focus better on the characters and it is also the case in ""Amour"" for example, a film I really really loved. It's not really the cast in ""Das weiße Band"", but also a very good film. ""Funny Games"" is a movie Haneke made long before these two that got great acclaim also from the Academy Awards in the USA.Anyway, there are many really interesting aspects in ""Funny Games"", for example the breaking of the 4th wall on several occasions or the way one character uses a remote to move back in time and make something undone, literally turn back time. This is certainly not a film for everyone and you definitely need strong nerves to sit through it, because it's extremely shocking from start to finish. Still pay attention how you never see anybody dying in front of the camera, even if it is very obvious in all cases. Final note: Haneke made a US version 10 years later. I have not seen that one, but I'd be surprised if it's as good as this one here. The 1997 one has a remarkable script and great acting from the entire cast. Highly recommended.",Funny Games
2,claudio_carvalho,"A Masterpiece of Sadism, Alienation and Cruelty",9,27 December 2008,"Georg (Ulrich Mühe), Anna (Susanne Lothar), their young son Georgie and their dog Rolfi travel in vacation with their sailboat to spend a couple of weeks in their lakeside cottage. When they arrive, they ask their neighbors and friends Fred (Christoph Bantzer) and Eva (Monika Zallinger) if they could help them to put the boat in the water and they note that the couple has guests and an unusual behavior. While Georg and his son are in the lake outfitting the boat, Anna is in the kitchen preparing steaks. Out of the blue, a well-educated young man wearing white gloves named Peter (Frank Giering) knocks on the door asking four eggs for Eva; he accidentally breaks the eggs and asks for another four. Sooner his arrogant partner Paul (Arno Frisch) joins him and Anna asks them to leave her house. When her husband and her son arrive from the lake, Georg is hit on his knee by Paul with a golf club and the family is imprisoned by the strangers that start to play a sick and sadistic deadly game along the night with the defenseless family.""Funny Game"" is the movie that made Michael Haneke worldwide known and certainly is ahead of time and a masterpiece of sadism, alienation and cruelty. I believe ""Funny Games"" in the late 90's had the same impact of ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the early 70's, and I recall how disturbed I was after watching this impressive movie. The sick violence of Paul and Peter is free, and the Brazilian title is perfect and even more appropriate for this movie. The performances are stunning, giving full credibility to the plot. The last time I saw this movie was on 18 December 2000, and I have just watched it again to compare with the unnecessary American version. The most amazing is that eleven years after the release, the impact of ""Funny Game"" is reduced, showing how the world violence increased along the last decade and how we get used to abuse and destruction. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Violência Gratuita"" (""Free Violence"")",Funny Games
3,jboothmillard,Funny Games,6,10 August 2011,"I remember spotting the description and photo for this Austrian film listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You, I had no idea about what was about until I read a little, it definitely sounded interested, from director Michael Haneke (Hidden (Caché). Basically a wealthy family, parents Anna (Susanne Lothar) and Georg (The Lives of Others' Ulrich Mühe), their son Georgie (Stefan Clapczynski), and their dog Rolfi have travelled for a holiday in a Austrian lakeside summer house. After arriving Georg and Georgie go off sailing on the lake, and Anna prepares dinner in the kitchen, she interrupted with the arrival of young man Peter (Frank Giering) who wants to borrow some eggs. It seems he innocently drops the eggs and goes back for more, and also dampens the cell phone, and obviously he gets Anna more frustrated, the arrival of his acquaintance, brash arrogant young man Paul (Arno Frisch). By the time Georg and Georgie arrive back, she is so frustrated she is demanding they leave, and when they refuse it is obvious that the events were not accidents but intentional. Peter and Paul trap the family as captives in the lake house, and violent acts begin, as the two young men start to play sadistic and torturous games for their own amusement. Their nasty intent was proved when dog Rolfi was found dead, then Peter breaks Georg's leg with a golf club, and they make a little bet with themselves that the family may not stay alive after 09:00 the next morning. While the violence ensues Paul keeps insulting Peter about his weight and seemingly low intelligence, but the origins and a motive for their actions is never revealed. We see Anna turn away some people for help pretending the two men are friends, and Georgie attempts to escape the house for help next door, but he finds the family there have been murdered. He did grab an empty shotgun, and Paul takes him back with the gun and the bullets for it, and after a few more games we hear Peter shoot Georgie dead, and they seem to leave the house. Anna and Georg are alone and after weeping together because of the death of their son they try to dry the cellphone to call for help, but when this doesn't work she leaves running for help she tries to find, while broken-legged Georg keeps trying the phone. Of course Paul and Peter only left momentarily and recapture Anna, kill Georg, and the final scenes see them take Anna out on the boat tied up and gagged, and even though it is early to 09:00 they throw her off to drown, and find another family to victimise. Also starring Stefan Clapczynski as Schorschi, Doris Kunstmann as Gerda, Christoph Bantzer as Fred and Wolfgang Glück as Robert. Giering and Frisch do a great job being the psychotic pair who torture with their degrading and sickening humiliation, and Lothar and Mühe are just as effective as the couple suffering it all. I was mistaken in thinking this film was four stars out of five, what the actual three stars, but that doesn't make this any less watchable, it is deliberately hard to watch with powerful shocks, certainly a psychological horror thriller to see. Good!",Funny Games

There happens to be the next stop for a pair of psychopathic young , articulate, white-gloved serial killers on an excursion through the neighborhood . They take the family hostage in their cabin and all of them are physically and mentally submitted to coercion , torture , punches , kicks and many others things .Violent as well as disturbing film about two psychotic young men take a mother , father, and son hostage in their vacation cabin and the family is forced to participate in a number of sadistic games in order to stay alive . This is a thought-provoking exploration of our violent society by means of two young delinquents and how depictions of violence reflect and shape our culture, a middle-class family submits violence, and death foisted upon them by two young , unexpected, white-gloved visitors at their vacation retreat near a lake. Violent film dealing with a familiar deconstruction in the way violence is portrayed in the media . Good acting from protagonist duo , Ulrich Muhe and Susanne Lothar , marriage in real life , and both of whom sadly deceased . Actress Isabelle Huppert was offered the lead role of Ann but turned it down as she thought both the film and the lead character's hardships were too disturbing to portray , she regretted the decision later after seeing it, but still admitted she probably wouldn't have the courage to do it . Director Michael Haneke has said that he never intended 'Funny Games' to be a horror film ; instead his idea was to make a film with a moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society , it's a subject that Haneke is quite passionate about. When the film was screened at Cannes in 1997 it shocked the audience badly enough that many viewers, including some film critics, walked out of the screening. This ¨Funny Games¨ was remade in English-language adaptation (2007) , starred by American roles , as George Farber (Tim Roth), his wife Ann (Naomi Watts), his son Georgie (Devon Gearhart) and two violent young men, Peter (Brady Corbet) and Paul (Michael Pitt) .The motion picture was well directed by Michael Hanake . Hanake is considered to be one of the best European filmmakers and Twice winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for The white ribbon (2009) and Amour (2012); as playwright he directed a number of stage productions in German . He has directed various brooding and engaging films ¨Cache¨ , ¨Time of the wolf¨ , ¨The piano teacher¨, ¨Unknown code¨ , ¨Benny's video¨, ¨The seventh continent¨ and ¨The castle¨ also starred by marriage Ulrich Muhe and Susanne Lothar .",Funny Games
6,BA_Harrison,"An interesting experiment, but a not entirely successful one.",7,20 February 2012,"A stereotypical home-invasion horror will simultaneously entertain and anger its audience by having its helpless victims subjected to sickening acts of violence and humiliation, before delivering a satisfyingly cathartic finale in which the survivors exact a fitting revenge on their tormentors.Director Michael Haneke is clearly not a supporter of such emotionally manipulative and patently unrealistic movie-making ploys and uses Funny Games to voice his concerns about the exploitative use of violence in cinema: he betrays those viewers who have come to expect a happy ending from such fare by repeatedly breaking the fourth wall, having his psychopaths communicate directly with the viewer (making them guilty of complicity), and eventually allowing the antagonists to alter the outcome of the film in their favour.Haneke's use of meta cinema to try and subvert the viewer's expectations is an undeniably brave move, but I cannot help feel that it doesn't succeed as well as intended; this could be because there just isn't enough of this self-reflexivity to allow the viewer become comfortable with the concept, but if I were to be brutally honest, I reckon it's because it's simply not handled with the level of finesse required.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Funny Games
7,dbdumonteil,From Benny's games to funny games.,8,20 June 2003,"The same actor plays Paul in ""funny games"" and Benny in ""Benny's video"" ,one of Haneke's previous works.There are some clues in this film:¨Paul directly speaks to the audience at several times (is es genug?)and the remote control sequence will leave you on the edge of your seat.Actually,Paul and his sidekick act as if they are in a play,and they are anyway.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOIERS SPOILERS""Funny games"" is Haneke's most accessible work ,far more conventional ,so to speak ,than former works such as ""der Siebente Kontinent"" ""71 FRagments"" or ""Benny's video"".That does not mean it's for everyone:with its absolute darkness,its cold violence,its God-forsaken world (the prayer sequence is telling:is the female character really playing? or does she believe she may get some help from above?)The things ,even if they are now outshadowed by the human beings (whereas ,in ""der Siebente Kontinent"" ,they were in the foreground),are more important than in other directors works :the eggs ;the gloves the two boys are wearing:why didn't it alarm the naive Hausfrau;and the use of the golf ball can rival with the best of Lang or Hitchcock.Haneke never wanted his audience to be peeping toms :so we never see the forced strip-tease of the heroine (which will remind you of that of Julie London in Anthony Mann's ""man of the West,1958);we never see the murders,except the last one during which the dialogue turns so trite it plays everything down.Haneke suggests more than he shows ,like the great directors Hitchcock,Lang,or Polanski.His sense of ellipsis is incredible and gives goose pimples:we do not attend the kid's murder,we're in the kitchen with one of the intruders:just one harrowing scream ,then silence.A fixed shot which lasts several agonizing minutes displays a dark living-room.We know something unspeakable happened.And however ,when they try to regain consciousness,they never speak of the tragedy which happened.And what a tragedy!The loss of a child ,is there anything worse?Are these parents like those of ""Benny's video"" trying to pick up selfishly the pieces ?Or else,as we wish they could,probably they cannot get it through their heads ,they do not realize what happened to them.Not a word for this unfortunate victim,all they want to do is to escape ,to save their dear lives.This might seem monstrous to some !The killers have some kind of logic which will make your hair stand on end.The hostage-taking of a whole family is not new in the cinema .But Haneke's approach is completely new because the torturers look like the guys next door,because their murders have no purpose no sense :neither money,nor bourgeoisie contemps (as in Claude Chabrol's ""la cérémonie"" which Haneke's masterwork considerably dwarfs) can explain the two lads' motivation.And in the French director's thriller ,Sandrine Bonnaire's and Isabelle Huppert's crimes were not premeditated.One may regret the tricky end which lacks originality and was used a thousand times or more.But it's only a detail.Haneke's movies are crying to be seen.",Funny Games
8,Coventry,"Weir sense of humor, these Germans...",6,27 April 2006,"Oh yeah, this movie was very funny! Couldn't stop laughing I mean, isn't torturing innocent people and children THE most fun? Hmm, as you can guess by its reputation and the other reviews around here, Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" isn't exactly the type of film that makes you merry. Haneke is a brilliant German director who was never really interested in the bright side of humanity and revolves all his films on misery, emotional pain and violence. Without ever reverting to exploitative gore, his films are disturbingly intense and petrifying on a psychological level and his narrative style somehow always involves the audience. ""Funny Games"" is another truly effective and chilling thriller but, regretfully, it slightly fails in being a social satire about the role of the media in the portrayal of violence. The only inferior moments in this film are the brief shots in which the characters pro-actively address themselves to the viewer and emphasize that this is a movie. Particularly the ""rewind""-scene towards the end was pretty stupid and it nearly ruined the whole movie for me. I can only hope that Haneke subsequently decided to add this part in order to prevent his film from being too 'harsh' for the likes of critics and mainstream audiences. Enough about the minor flaws, as the largest part of ""Funny Games"" is genuinely shocking and exceptional. A middle-aged couple and their son arrive at their lakeside house for the annual vacation in which they sail and catch up with old friends. Before finishing unpacking already, two twenty-something boys show up at the door and invite themselves in. In a polite way, they're being very obtrusive and they quickly turn out to be repellent psychopaths that kill and torture for no apparent reason. Again, Haneke shows almost no explicit violence and mainly focuses on the nihilistic nature of the young criminals and  especially  the emotional aftermath of their vile games. Most of the film seems to be filmed in real-time, which only increases the intensity of the family's suffering and several sequences are incredibly difficult to watch. ""Funny Games"" literally is a devastating cinematic experience and definitely not intended for all types of viewers.",Funny Games
9,searchanddestroy-1,Peter Collinson's DNA,10,4 May 2021,"I thought about some of Peter Collinson's features when I watched this one: PENTHOUSE, OPEN SEASON, though the latest was not a home invasion, but instead a home guest topic, where a bunch of hunters, human being hunters, abducted an illegitimate couple, brought them to a cabin in the woods, fed them like regular ""guests"" then hunt them down. The behavior of the hunters in OPEN SEASON was very similar to the ugly ones here, terrifying and gentle, kind and nasty, smooth and brutal. Gruesome atmosphere, not for the sissies. In PENTHOUSE, it was a genuine home invasion scheme, closer to this one however. Very delicate, disturbing, unbearable atmosphere for those no prepared. A real shock, but a so delightful shock. Forget super heroes junk. In this story, You can think about STRAW DOGS, Elia Kazan's THE VISITORS, with a zest of CLOCKWORK ORANGE.",Funny Games
10,preppy-3,"Sick, disturbing but interesting",1,27 October 1999,"A family is terrorized by two psychos in an isolated vacation house. That's the whole plot. The movie is sick, degrading and sadistic (people walked out when I saw it)--but it won't leave me. I saw it a few years ago and I still can't shake it. It is well-directed and extremely well-acted and it is horrifying. My guess is that it's trying to show how madness and evil can show up anywhere at any time and how any one can be destroyed. But there's one aspect of this film I HATE. One of the killers keeps turning to the audience and making comments like, ""You want to see more, don't you?"" It seems it's implicating the audience and pointing out that they are just as responsible as the killers for these people being degarded and tortured. In other words we're guilty of watching this. I don't buy that for one second. If that's true, what does that make the director who directed this? He made this violent sick movie...but that's OK? He's clean because he's not watching? That's bull. Also, when one of the killers is shot and (hopefully) killed the other REWINDS the movie to save him! That's cheating and a pretty dumb device. Still it does stay with you, but do you really want to sit and watch a family being terrorized AND be blamed for it? View at your own risk.",Funny Games
11,lastliberal,Why are you doing this? Why not?,8,13 July 2010,"There was a point in the film where one of the perpetrators turns not to the victims, but to us, those that are watching the film, as asks us if we feel they have a chance of winning a bet on their lives. It is clear that we are part of the film. In what way? Maybe we have become so used to violence that it is a game - a funny game - to us. Maybe we need to be reminded that real people are involved in violence. It is not a game.I have already seen the 2007 version of this film. It is exactly the same script, just different actors.

12,The_Void,It's 'funny' alright....,8,24 May 2005,"Funny Games is a film that has tried to be a bit too clever for it's own good, but somehow got away it and is still a very good movie. Exactly what the director wanted to achieve with this film is unknown, as there isn't a defining point to the movie; but a 'point' doesn't seem to be important anyway, as this film is all about style. The plot is simple and it follows a family that goes to stay in their vacation cabin. However, one thing they don't count on during their holiday is two psycho's interrupting their fun and imprisoning them in their own home. This sort of film leaves a lot open for inventiveness, and this movie has that. Some of the techniques used are really great and although they don't appear to have much point - like one of the bad guys winking at the screen, for example - it does give the film a nice edge, that separates it from other films in it's class and also shows that director Michael Haneke has something about him, as he isn't happy to just wallow in the clichés of this sort of film.While I do like this film a lot as it's a great ride and one that I very much enjoyed, it has to be said that the film could have been a lot better. The idea of two random people coming along and completely empowering a family their own home is shocking, and the way that the film is very self-aware in that is a movie is good, but if it had added a social commentary that isn't impossible to see, and gave the audience a bit more on the idea of the family home being 'invaded'; it could have been in masterpiece territory. Earlier in the review I said that the film doesn't have a 'point', which seems to be the case; but it does know what it wants to do, and that is shock the viewer. The fact that it has a very defined element of realism helps the film in this bid, and some of the events in the movie really are shocking. The film appears to want to analyse the relationship between the audience and a movie, and it does this by way of having the lead characters ask the audience questions (like ""You are on their side, aren't you?""), and this does somewhat work...just not all that well.Basically, Funny Games is a thriller that overstepped it's mark. It has tried to be too clever, and the result is a film that is messy and doesn't really know what it wants to be. However, if viewed as a straight shock-thriller; it will be enjoyed.

15,lasttimeisaw,The original is a nefarious succès-de-scandale but its US remake is a bespoke commodity speaks volumes of Haneke's faintly veiled intention,7,25 December 2017,"A double-bill of Michael Haneke's notoriously provocative home-invasion thriller FUNNY GAMES, its original version and the US shot-by-shot remake made a decade later with a different cast, they are basically the same film, the only noticeable revision is a landline telephone would be plausibly upgraded to a cellphone. Affixing death metal to high-brow classical music, FUNNY GAMES alerts us from the beginning of its irreconcilably conflicting parties in this game of torture and murder: the bourgeois nuclear family (emblazoned by their lakeside holiday residence and a private boat) versus two white-gloves-sporting, acedia-afflicted young psychopaths (whose backgrounds are completely in the shadows). It is very interesting to watch how genteel etiquette disintegrates into hostility on a moment's notice, and how it becomes a fortune to hostage if one is that prone to irritability yet not cautious enough to the consequences, although what is blatantly shocking is the want of clear motive behind these two amoral young men, who wallow in inflicting sadism and cruelty to innocent people, and are dangerously masked by a normal and friendly appearance. But after watching the same story twice (not recommended though), a viewer may sense something perniciously self-serving in the scene nearly the beginning, the couple can be cautioned by their friend (aka. the previous hostage), a warning out of desperation might not be a game-changer to overcome the perpetrators (who are in possession of a rifle), but at least, they can try to fight back and very likely break the vicious circleAlso one can second-guess that in lieu of complete resignation, the wife could have shown some bravura by jumping onto their neighbor's departing boat in the eleventh hour only if she knew it would be her last chance. To mitigate the ill-feeling stemmed from audience's emotional investment of the beleaguered family, Haneke opts for a novel schtick by allowing one of the young wrongdoer Paul (Frisch/Pitt) to occasionally break the 4th wall and even play God with a remote control when an unpremeditated accident croaking his companion, archly takes audience away from their heinous act and nattering hogwash, renders a refreshing sensation of levity, which is a crying reprieve at that point of the narrative (after sending both a dog and a child to meet their makers out of Haneke's convention-defying obduracy). The film is violent no doubt, but mercifully we are spared from witnessing direct simulation of killing save its grisly aftermath, and it is fire and brimstone for the two leads, in the earlier version, the late Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Mühe (who became a couple in real life after making this film) stupendously put themselves through the wringer of distress, terror and despair, command onerous brawn against physical hindrance (including in a challenging long take lasting more than ten minutes), and Lothar notably drains all her energy into a traumatized state that's too disturbing to look twice. The same impression is ineluctably blunted in the remake, due to the vanishing thrill of reiteration, nevertheless Naomi Watts, undergoes the same ordeal with equally gutsy virtuosity but less apparel.On the villain parts, a wide-eyed Michael Pitt totally and literally pales in comparison with Arno Frisch, whose bumptious self-assurance is simultaneously gnawing and sinister, whereas Frank Giering and Brady Corbet both make a good accomplice who is unpleasantly effete and morbidly creepy. Teasing with the line between reality and fiction, the sick underside of human frailties often overlooked by the prim and the proper, Haneke's succès-de-scandale is not for faint-hearted but an anglophone remake made in facsimile betrays his eagerness to unleash the bane on those subtitle-eschewing English-speaking Americans, a bespoke commodity speaks volumes of his faintly veiled intention.",Funny Games

Really?!,7,28 January 2018,"I'm a great fan of Naomi Watts, so when I saw Funny Games from 1997, I could not resist watching a remake immediately. After a few minutes, I realized that this is not a classic remake, but literally to the detail the same movie, only shot at another location and with the other set of actors. Ok, they've changed dog breed and cell phone and kitchen appliances are more modern, but everything else is identical. Every scene, every cadre, every word. I do not understand why Haneke had the need to do something like this, without even trying to bring at least a little original spirit into this remake. After fifteen minutes I got bored, so , out of love for Naomi, I just skipped to the key points and watched the most important scenes. At first I was sorry I did not watch the remake first, because of Naomi of course, but I soon discovered that I did not make a mistake because the original is somewhat better.Funny Games is a psychological thriller/horror, which shows the family on vacation in the middle of nowhere. A couple of young sociopaths break into their house and start a psycho-physical terror. Story is solid, with no big holes and illogicality, and shows the situation very realistically. The directing is excellent and manages to build an extremely stressful atmosphere completely without explicit scenes, with this tension somewhat stronger in the original. As far as acting is concerned, it's hard to say which cast is better overall. Although Michael Pitt is really creepy, Arno Frisch and Frank Giering are much better in roles of young sociopaths. On the other hand, Naomi Watts is slightly better Anna than Susanne Lothar, while Tim Rot completely overshadows Ulrich Mühe from the very start.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!All in all, this more than a solid thriller, with a strong atmosphere that kept me on the edge of the seat, would have earned a strong eight, maybe even nine, if Haneke did not come to a totally moronic idea to add a ""fourth dimension"", i.e. direct communication with the audience. On several occasions we have freezing of the image, actors talking to the audience, and on top of everything, one of the characters takes the remote control in the middle of denouement, rewinds the movie few minutes back, and then movie takes completely different direction. This kind of scene is suitable only and exclusively in comedies, and even there it's outworn, but for a serious psychological thriller it is a complete deal-breaker and spoils overall impression to seven tops. Due to a certain difference in the atmosphere of the original and the remake, I give them half a score up and down.1997. - 7,5/10

Frisch makes a scary villain, but the three actors playing the family are not very convincing, with the couple's nonchalant attitude towards their son particularly odd. Haneke is not so much interested in creating a thriller as in showcasing his indulgent brand of filmmaking. Here the German director has his villain break the ""fourth wall"" with asides to the audience. While such a device is fine for comedy, it is wholly inappropriate for a serious film. There's a scene where the screen is basically frozen for about ten minutes. And then there's a scene with the remote control that defies explanation. Pure indulgence.",Funny Games

They are, apparently, friends of the neighbors, and, at the beginning, their true intentions are not known. But soon, the family is imprisoned and tortured in its own house violently, which the viewers are forced mostly to imagine and to share a certain complicity with the criminals.

One can envision Peter and Paul (or Beavis and Butthead, as they call each other throughout the film) in their black SS uniforms, riding crop in one hand whilst the other drops another canister of Zyklon B. The acting is superb throughout, and the film's setup for a sequel is a neat tip of the hat to the slasher genre. Compelling but hard to watch.",Funny Games
22,billcr12,Excellent thriller,8,25 April 2012,"Michael Haneke wrote and directed Funny Games in Germany in 1997. He did an American shot for shot remake in 2008. Both are very good thrillers but I'll use the original for a review. Georg, his wife Anna, their son Schorschi and the pet doggie, Rolfi arrive at the family lake house for some leisure time. They are members of the German upper class who enjoy the good things in life. They are introduced by their neighbor, Fred, to Peter and Paul, who soon impose themselves by destroying a phone and breaking eggs of the perfect home. When asked politely to leave, Paul kills the loyal pet and Peter breaks Georg's leg with a nine iron; ouch that hurt! Paul quizzes the lucky threesome by asking them if they would like to bet whether they will be alive by nine o'clock the next morning. The two psychopaths argue back and forth in a comical manner and when other neighbors visit, Anna tells them that they are friends. Murder and mayhem ensue to an interesting conclusion which is a satisfying and believable one; Haneke has made a biting and entertaining thriller.",Funny Games

It is a bit theatrical, as if done on a big stage. Nevertheless, it succeeds with shiny actors, extreme well play reaching near summit of depravity, sadism and deranged minds.To all sensitive people in all aspects, stay away from this movie and its sequel, as it is not your everyday cup of tea and morbid curiosity may bring you most tragic nightmares.",Funny Games
25,EVOL666,"Another Not-So-Shocking, Yet Good Film",8,21 September 2005,"FUNNY GAMES is another one of those films that I bought after hearing about the ""shocking"" and ""controversial"" content. I have to say, I didn't really find FUNNY GAMES very ""shocking"" or ""controversial"", but I did find it to be a very good film. The story centers around 2 psychotic hoodlum kids who hijack a family who are on vacation. They then mentally and physically abuse the family. The film is extremely well-acted, especially the 2 male leads. They are believable and extremely un-likable, which is exactly what I think the director was aiming for. The violence is mainly understated and off-screen, so those looking for a blood-bath may as well leave this one on the shelf. There is a scene where the family's son is killed (again off screen...) that a lot of people seem to take offense at. It is pretty tough to watch kids getting killed in film, but honestly, I had seen THE UNTOLD STORY (a classic Hong Kong nasty) and after seeing the child murder scene in that film (where several children around age 5 are brutally butchered ON camera...), everything else sorta pales in comparison. Even so, FUNNY GAMES is an intense and very well made thriller that may prove a little much for the standard movie-goer, also because the film ends on a decidedly grim (and cool) note. But anyone into more thought-provoking, subversive cinema should dig this one. Recommended 8.5/10",Funny Games

Funny Games may not be the first of its kind, but it creates an air of dullness which seems to contradict the inner meaning of the film.

29,Jonny_Numb,Suffering? You ain't seen nothing yet...,8,17 June 2008,"I watched this year's remake of ""Funny Games"" prior to the original, simply because its sick-with-irony trailer got me extremely curious. Granted, this goes against my usual process of viewing a remake's precursor prior to the remake itself, but I couldn't help myself. By the end, I was astonished by writer-director Michael Haneke's audacity in telling a macabre home-invasion story devoid of Hollywood glamour, humor, and mercyremake or no, it's still one of the ballsiest exercises in visceral, reality-based horror ever released by a major studio.So, when I decided to give the original ""Funny Games"" a spin (mere days after my viewing of American version), I was filled with presupposition toward how much I would appreciate the original (with the twists of Haneke's shot-for-shot remake still mapped out in my mind)similar to a sadistic ""bet"" our captors make with their prey, I was wondering if this earlier, German-language version would survive on its own terms. And, while each version is practically identical (save for some subtle nuances in the performances, the slightly varied location design, andof coursethe spoken language), both quite miraculously carry the same visceral, jaw-dropping sucker-punches as the other. Unlike the much-derided American remakes of ""The Vanishing"" and ""Les Diaboliques,"" Haneke sees no need to let either culture off the hook, especially when each has its own prominent history of violence, on- and off-camera.Ironically, the references to metalhead couch potatoes Beavis and Butt-Head probably seemed like an incendiary bitch-slap to the passive glamorization of American filmed violence in the 1997 version, but there is an even stronger sense of irony when the MTV-hosted duo are referenced in the remakeon the shores that birthed them, and the cult following of Generation Y-ers that has accumulated in the years since the show's cancellation (a sure sign that our passivity, if anything, is more pronounced now). It's subtle observations like this that give both versions of ""Funny Games"" an added resonance.If anything takes some getting used to in the 1997 film, it's the general unfamiliarity of the cast. After seeing a collection of familiar performers run through Haneke's horrifying 2008 experiment, the German cast begins with a studied approach to the performances that eventually loosens into hysteria and desperation that is just as convincing as their remake counterparts. It is truly stunning how Haneke mines the same static framing and intense performances to ends that are equally effective in both films (even knowing the outcome of a protracted long take following a pivotal off-screen event, I found the experience just as emotionally agonizing to witness).While it may seem hypocritical to ""side"" with Haneke (at least in the context his film creates), especially when I patronize (and am prone to enjoying) films that frequently downplay the reality of human suffering, the effect in both versions of ""Funny Games"" is undeniably powerfulthese are difficult, ugly, and emotionally draining films crafted with undeniable (and remarkably subtle) purpose. If there's any catharsis to be had from them, it will be in the introspection and assessment of your own attitudes toward violence.",Funny Games
30,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"A Meta, Home Invasion Film with Interesting Social Commentary",8,30 July 2019,"Now I have to be honest, I actually saw the American remake first. In college my roommate had rented it and told me that it would be up my alley since I'm into horror films. I did like it, but I thought some of the breaking of the 4th wall was a bit too much. When I learned that this was written and directed by the same guy, I knew that I had to see the original. It has been well over a decade since I saw the original and finally checked it out for a Best of Horror in the 1990's series for a podcast. The synopsis is two violent young men take a mother, father and son hostage in their vacation cabin and force them to play sadistic ""games"" with one another for their own amusement.We start this film in a car on its way to vacation home that is talked about in the synopsis. The mother is Anna (Susanne Lothar) and she is riding in the passenger seat. Driving is her husband Georg (Ulrich Mühe). Their son is in the back, Stefan Clapczynski, and they also have their dog. The parents are playing a game in the car where they try to guess the composer of classic music, the title of the piece and things to this nature.When they are arriving, they see their neighbors are outside with some younger men. They ask if they can help to get their boat into the water and it is agreed they will. The family goes into their house and to unpack. The two young men come over, Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering). It is interesting they're both wearing white gloves, but it is never acknowledged by the family.Peter comes to the door asking if they can get some eggs to take to the neighbors. Anna asks what they're for and Peter tells her he doesn't know. She gives him 4 eggs and before he leaves, he drops them. Anna cleans it up and agrees to give him four more, after he is persistent. She wraps them up this time and then he comes back when the dog jumped on him so he dropped them. This time though, Paul is there and he asks to check out a golf club belonging to Georg. The dog is outside barking, but he stops, which catches the attention of Georg.He comes up to the house and Anna is going crazy. She wants the two young men to leave and Georg is confused as to what is going on. He slaps Paul while telling them to go, which results in him getting hit in the leg with the golf club, shattering his leg. This is the beginning of psychological games that involve tying them up, asking them to decide who will die next and physically hurting them. It becomes a bet to see if they can survive the next twelve hours or not and gets to the point, would have even want to survive this game?Now I should give you some background here. The writer and director, Michael Haneke, wrote this film if my memory serves because he feels that human nature is sick that we watch the news to see bad things happening. This film actually breaks the 4th wall much like his remake does, but to be honest, I like how they do it here. It is much more subtle and there are just a few times that Paul directly speaks to us. The film is really questioning us and if we want to see these depraved things that are happening. I also noticed some of this in framing some shots. Where we normally would get a normal two-shot, where it is at an angle, we get it where they're positioned looking directly at the camera. A lot of this is engaging us, saying that we are depraved and want more.What really makes this scary to me is that these boys really don't have a motive for what they're doing. I like that it plays with them pretending they had bad things happening in their past to cause them to. It is even better is that Georg calls them out on this and they flat out acknowledge that he is right, they're both well to do kids who are looking to the future, but they just decide to do these things. It isn't a new concept, as you can see in The Strangers and Knock Knock that they don't need a motive and that to me is scary. It is interesting though that this film came out first from the two films I mentioned.For the remake, I heard a podcast questioning why the family never asks why these two are wearing gloves. We know it is so they don't leave fingerprints. For this version, the family is so busy with unpacking and getting their boat ready, I could see overlooking why these two are just randomly wearing gloves. I've been busy doing something that I haven't noticed some things that could be like this for sure.I want to move next to the pacing of the film. I like that it really doesn't waste any time getting into it. We get introduced to the family and then seeing these two young men with the neighbors is interesting. It totally disarms the family, because they think they know them. We soon get the idea that the other family was toyed with and there's a group that Anna speaks to on the dock with Peter and Paul. There is sense of impending dread that they will be next. That is what the film does, the dread just builds. There is a moment that I feel is a bit of cheat, but I get why the film does it. This is late in the second act, start of the third act. This film also hits a lull before that for me. I get the emotional impact this game has on the family, but it does go on a bit long for my liking. The ending definitely works for what we are seeing as well.That moves me to the acting of the film, which I thought was really good. Lothar is pretty strong in the beginning of the film. I would say that she's the strongest. We see her completely defeated by the end though and I really liked that. Her performance in this was solid. Mühe is more subdued, which I find interesting. He is hobbled pretty early on and I thought his performance was fine. It just isn't as strong as Lothar, which to me is speaking about norms where the husband is the weaker of the two. I really liked the two villains. There is smugness about them. Firsch is even mean to Giering, which I found interesting. They did a really good job. I do have to commend Clapczynski as well. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.To the effects of the film, this is where I have a bit of an issue. Everything that happens violently is done off screen. I find this interesting that the film is a social commentary on why we as viewers like watching films or television with this in it, yet you don't show it. I do wonder, since it was all practical, if they couldn't pull it off which would affect the realism. I do think the aftereffects are solid though and the emotional impact worked. The film is shot very well in my opinion as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. For the most part it didn't really stand out to me aside from a few things. I do think that it really shows the demeanor of this family while they're playing the game of guessing the classic music. That makes them trying to fight back make sense and a solid reason for Paul and Peter to pick them. I do love the metalish song that was used. We get it in the opening credits, during a scene with the boy and then at the end. I do want to add it to collection if I'm honest.Now with that said, I did enjoy this film in a sick twisted way. The social commentary is interesting and I think the breaking of the 4th wall works here better than in the remake. The story is pretty basic, but it is effective. I think that the acting really carries it which was good across the board. I do think the film has a slight pacing issue. It gets into it; there is just a lull in the second act and a cheat that I didn't really care for after that. The ending works for what the film is showing us and its shot well. I did want more from the effects side as most everything is off-screen. I do love the metal song used and the rest of the soundtrack fit for what is needed. Overall I thought this was a good film, but I would only recommend it if you want to check out the social commentary. I will warn you, this film is from Austria. It is in German, so I had to watch it with subtitles on. If that's an issue, I would avoid this one for sure.",Funny Games
31,rosscinema,Torturous viewing,2,19 June 2003,"I usually describe the plot when I post my comments but with this film I just want to get this over with and think of the next movie I will watch. I understand that the director hates Hollywood films and this is his way of showing that violence has no satisfactory ending to it and a lot of times the good guys don't win. I also understand that this is a film from the perspective of the main psycho who can rewind certain events with a remote control. But I still found this to be arguably the most unpleasant viewing experience of my life. I hate probably most Hollywood films and I am constantly watching foreign and independent films so I'm no shallow prude! As I watched this it dawned on me that the style of this film is that it has no style. Its more of an exercise in being anti Hollywood. Like when the weak and pathetic son managed to get away and couldn't get through the fence! Where are they? Fort Knox? And he didn't just run and get help but he goes into the first house and doesn't even make a decent effort to hide. Films from this part of the world would have been different. The director makes his point but we still have to endure the torturous events to this family. My complaint is that he could have made his point in a more timely manor without making the viewer so aggravated. But I guess the director made his point the way he wanted. Some have called this film compelling but I found it redundant to the point of feeling like my senses were assaulted. It does offer a view point of violence and the way Hollywood caters to the more shallow minded but I still feel that this could have been made differently. Yes, the director made a film exactly the way he wanted and he did make his point well. Which is why I didn't like it!",Funny Games
32,Galina_movie_fan,George: Why are you doing this to us? Paul: Why not?,10,7 August 2007,"Watching ""Funny Games"" (1997) directed by Michael Haneke for the first time was an unforgettable visceral experience. It was the horror that really scared, devastated, and stayed with me long after the final scene was over. I can't easily recall another movie that made me go through the same emotions as the innocent victims in the movie did, to feel the same helplessness, hopelessness, despair, humiliation, and horror. I could not stop thinking of how illusory and fragile nature of happiness and safety is and how easy it is to shatter and destroy them. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future? It's been several years since I saw the film but it still makes me shiver just to think about it.""Funny Games"" can be first mistaken for yet another conventional thriller where the good guys always win in the end and the evil is punished. Wrong, not by Haneke. He shocks you, he hits you in the gut, and then, he shocks you again. Haneke's is a true horror for his monsters don't look like the creatures from hell. No, ""they are among us"", they are nice and polite, well read, shy and ironic, they have the names from the new Testament, Paul and Peter, they talk with the soft refined voices but they are monsters nevertheless who have no regard for a human life and who want to play their sadistic funny games to the extreme.""Funny Games"" is a controversial film and I've read many reviews and comments that call it ""a failure"", accusing the film and its creator of not having said anything new or original on the connected subjects of violence, the media, and voyeuristic audience. It may not be a new or original subject Haneke dissects in his film but how he did it, his matter-of fact approach to the material and the seemingly unemotional manner affected me deeply, and I don't think I would ever forget this film.",Funny Games
33,p-stepien,Beavis and Jerry,6,6 September 2012,"An idyllic well-off family of three, Georg (Ulrich Mühe), Anna (Susanne Lothar) and their son Schorschi (Stefan Clapczynski) are abducted by two immaculately behaved youngsters Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering) at their reclusive lakeside vacation house...Given the artistic angle of Michael Haneke a strong focus of written reviews is placed on the shoulders of its social commentary, whilst the story itself takes the back-burner. Few distinctly comment on the story as a pure horror movie, even though it borrows clichés and essentially poses as an exemplary thriller. Just to take a step back from deeper analysis what about viewing the project as a total package?. As such ""Funny Games"" offers a cold and calculating psychological nerve attack and even though the gore or creativity of the sadists is pretty brittle the emotional wallop makes an uneasy viewing. Tension builds up creating the sense of hopelessness and paradise lost within the confines of your own home. Nonetheless what's a horror movie without crater sized plot holes or idiotic victims, who basically throw themselves onto knives, guns and/or golfing clubs? Our trio of hapless misfits go through no length to get killed, including unbearable inertia, when presented the opportunity to do something. For example when visited by a boatload of friends Anna decides not to warn them, despite her single captor being unarmed. This escalates when Anna and Georg are left to themselves for 20+ minutes and undertake self-persevation at a morose uninterested pace. That said this could be a deliberate ploy by Haneke to poke fun at horror movie clichés and the ineptitude of victims. Given however Haneke seemingly lacks the credible overview of the genre (unlike Wes Craven and his ""Scream"") and this would seem a bit petty given the director's grand intentions, my bet is this is more owed to general script weakness than directorial foresight.Moreover throughout Haneke presents a certain level of dishonesty or lacklustre, as mistakes surface several times with blatant ridicule. Unintentionally symbolic when Paul breaks the fourth wall to state that the runtime isn't long enough for a feature film, when in fact we are 95 minutes into the strained experience. And strained it is - after a gripping opening the movie lags and struggles to keep interest, which at one point had me crying for the director to just kill everyone and show the end credits. This entailed an excruciatingly boring, irritating half hour of Anna and Georg attempting not to get rescued. Summarizing from the most basic level as a thriller ""Funny Games"" lacks the psychological punch of ""Straw Dogs"" or the visceral brutality of Eli Roth imaginings, essentially a pretty successful, but not ultimately shocking movie as many art-house fans make it out to be.That said Haneke's movie is first and foremost a commentary and although the packaging can't be ignored, focus should be placed on the underlying message. As evidently suggested by countless breaking of the fourth wall by Paul (winking at the camera or asking the audience whether they've had enough) and references to violence-ridden animations such as ""Tom and Jerry"" or ""Beavis and Butthead"", Haneke asks about what we view and why we view it. The evil protagonists are nihilistic and aimless, a product of the audience and their expectations to experience violence, brutality and mental torture, as if it brings us closer to understanding ourselves. The obvious empathy is directed towards the three hapless victims and despite the undying hope of retribution, the audience watches them being maimed, slaughtered and killed, as if to satisfy some need which we pretend doesn't exist. ""Funny Games"" manipulates the viewers sympathies, not offering respite. Why should the bad guys to ultimately lose, but only after the initial carnage they caused? Paul conversely asks the viewers these questions and gleefully fulfils initial expectations, but then following through with the deadly finale, not letting the viewers off the hook.The brutal relentlessness and the suggested blurring of reality with fiction are aimed at commenting on the theme of media violence, with which we coexist in seamless harmony. We watch these games, snicker at blood and gore, as if they were funny. If we watch the violence on screen in a fictional movie does it make it any less real, asks Paul after disposing of the last victim. Despite being emotional pulled into empathising with the tortured family, Haneke forces the viewer to enter a discourse, a meta-narrative, with their executioners, pointing out the shared responsibility for the on-screen violence. Pointing the finger at a society with violence as a story necessity, a means to an end, Haneke becomes the accuser. To enhance this Haneke attempts to initially create a close relation with the viewer in a starkly realistic setting with close up shots imbuing a sense of proximity. Slowly he strips away this closeness by juxtaposing it with Paul's winks to the audience, thus forcing them out of a the empathic attachment and points out the 'entertainment value' of cinematic violence.Despite strong kinship to ""Straw Dogs"", Haneke's self-admitted reference is towards Stanley Kubrick's work, most notably ""A Clockwork Orange"", which presents violence as an overlap of the surrounding society. Here however Haneke converts and personalises the question, as if asking: Why exactly are you watching this? In this dishonest jibe by Haneke is basically questioning why we don't turn off the movie. My return question would however be: Why exactly did you make such a movie, if you question motives for watching it? Much like preaching the immorality of theft by stealing a loaf of bread.An influential movie in many ways unfortunately lessons were not learnt, but morbidly rehashed into gorno, which litters the horror genre with mindless violence and takes breaking viewers as a matter of pride, not commentary. Where ""Funny Games"" suggests and breaks preassumptions to comment, gorno just kicks the rulebook away for the hell of it.",Funny Games
34,Sandcooler,Highly atmospheric and intriguing,8,7 July 2012,"Michael Haneke is a director that just loves to mess with our minds. Nothing in ""Funny Games"" is ever quite what it seems, it's a master class in toying with viewers' expectations. Don't get dragged into this expecting some sort of ""torture porn"", get dragged into this because it's a really good movie. You'll barely see any violence because everything's implied, but the atmosphere is totally suffocating. It's definitely not the most comfortable movie to watch, but somehow it's just totally fascinating. The only thing that didn't really work for me are the breakings of the fourth wall, which do have a clear point but still come of as stilted and a bit pompous. Aren't there more subtle ways to satirize violent cinema? The remote scene is sorta hilarious though, I'll give Haneke that.

A story about a family who arrive at their holiday home and are visited by a pair of polite and seemingly pleasant young men who proceed to terrorize and torture them. This is a punishing film because of the deplorable violence and small relief for the viewer.

37,capkronos,"Worn-out themes hidden behind a veil of flashy, pretentious direction.",4,22 August 2002,"This supposedly shocking, humorless and grim thriller is about an affluent couple (Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Muhe) and their young son, whose attempt at a peaceful retreat is turned into a nightmare. While vacationing at a remote and (so they think) ultra-secure lakeside home, the family is tormented by two clean-cut young men who initially stop by to borrow a few eggs, then won't leave. They try to provoke violence, break the dad's leg with a golf club, kill their dog, make the mother strip and lie about being gay, having horrible childhoods and being drug addicts for a motive (although it's made quite clear that they don't have or necessarily need one). When asked why, one says ""Why not?"" and it's all for ""entertainment value.""The commentary here, I suppose, is to illustrate that society is often pointlessly brutal and sadistic, and there's no real way to pinpoint an exact cause for the increasing violence in the world. Apparently the director is also doing some finger pointing of his own toward ""desensitized"" audiences who enjoy lapping up simulated violence in their popular entertainment, as well as those who tune into the nightly news to get the scoop on all the real-life horror stories taking place. In taking on this kind of material, Haneke creates the exact kind of film he is demonizing, which will make this a tough sell to certain people. Who doesn't look at the car accident site while they're passing by hoping to see what happened to the poor sucker involved in the wreck? Who doesn't see a violent scenario playing out in a film or on a TV show and stop to take a look? Most of us do... In my estimation, it's completely natural and healthy to fill one's morbid curiosity about the darker aspects of life and death via film, art and music. I'm not entirely sure what the point is in making us feel bad or guilty about it. If the director is simply wondering why violence and horror are so appealing to the masses, then his film completely lacks any insight, depth or psychological credibility when it comes to that topic.There's some flashy direction, but unfortunately, a lot of it just doesn't work... like long, unbroken takes that seem to go on for hours and a character who talks to the camera (""Is that enough?"") and then grabs a remote and rewinds the movie after something doesn't go his way. This was an official selection at Cannes and has a fan following, but I found it unpleasant, pretentious and downright boring at times, and it's nothing that numerous other films didn't already do (and do better) in the early 1970s.",Funny Games
38,jaredmobarak,"You're on their side, so who will you bet with?Funny Games",8,14 November 2006,"I've been meaning to write a review for Michael Haneke's Funny Games since rewatching it Halloween night. I had seen it for the first time around 3-4 years ago on IFC and was blown away by its inventiveness. It definitely holds up today as a sharp thriller and satire for our culture of wanting to see pain and torture on screen. With movies like Saw coming to theatres now, it may be even more relevant than it was in 1997. Word had it that Haneke, after the huge success of his most recent film Caché, would be remaking the film for English language audiences next year. I had reservations about this, but eventually heard it would be a revisioning not a strict copy in English, (although pulling a Gus Van SantPsychowould be cool to satirize America for being too lazy to either learn German or read subtitles that they need a Hollywood adaptation). Whether this is true or not, the film has gotten underway as I've heard from an old friend how he has been cast as a stand-in for one of the troubled youths. Although unknowingly, Brett Vanderbrook has finally gotten me on track to review Funny Games with his jogging my memory a couple weeks late.One knows they are in for a treat right off the bat watching a family drive along a road guessing classical music. All of a sudden the sound cuts to a heavy metal scream and the entire car ride is displayed, complete with the family still swaying their heads, with the jarring guitars and hoarse voice. The family finally reaches their vacation place and sets up to get a fishing excursion going and dinner cooking. When their neighbor's houseguests come over to help, the film really starts going. These two young boys, played with playful malice by Arno Frish and Frank Giering, begin to mess with the family psychologically until the confrontation escalates to violence. To make the proceedings more fun, they eventually strike a bet on whether the captors will survive the night. This would seem strange at first until the director does the unthinkable and breaks the fourth wall. Yes, the antagonists start to converse with the audience, making the viewer into an accomplice, allowing the torture to continue. Credit Haneke here as the first moment of using the camera as a character is so subtle, one will think, ""wow that was weird, I almost thought he was looking at us.""Funny Games is a comment on the fact that we as moviegoers enjoy to watch torture happen on screen. We feel safe knowing that the events transpiring are fake, yet feel inclined to watch them play out. By talking to the audience, Haneke is showing that these characters are conscious of their activities and are almost asking the audience if they should continue on their treacherous ways. Of course you could just walk out of the theatre or turn off the TV, but instead you become enthralled and need to see what happens. Just by finishing this film you yourself become that which it is a commentary on. One reason, however, besides the psychological reasoning, keeping you in your seats is the emotionally draining performances by Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Mühe. Their anguish at the helplessness of their situation towards themselves and their son is heartbreaking. They are at the mercy of their captors and must bear with the ""games"" until their fate is decided. You need to watch the excruciatingly long single take around three-quarters in, and see true cinema greatness. What Orson Welles did technically with his opening to Touch of Evil, Haneke does here emotionally. To be able to change mood from being defeated, to scared, to angry, to helpless, to utter sadness is amazing. If Naomi Watts even comes close in the remake to what Lothar did here, she will be guaranteed that Oscar she was robbed of for Mulholland Dr.Hopefully Haneke knows what he is doing with a retelling of his brilliant Funny Games. I must admit I recently told my friend Brett that Haneke was a God of cinema, mostly because of the jealousy that he gets to work on a movie with him no matter in what capacity. While that statement is a bit premature, being that I've only seen this film by him, I do own his filmography and in the near future will most certainly be able to make that declaration again feeling justified in doing so.",Funny Games

40,sharky_55,"So, who will you bet with?",7,19 October 2016,"Michael Haneke is one of the last few living propagators of cinematic modernism that we have left (RIP Abbas Kiarostami). Many know his 2005 masterpiece, Caché, or Hidden, but misread it and furiously focused on the answer to the puzzle of the video-tapes while brushing past the slow compression of historical and classist guilt and distress around Georges. Others know The White Ribbon, his modernist response to Hollywood Holocaust films such as Schindler's List, dubbed 'a whodunnit without a denouement, a historical parable without a lesson'. But of all these films the most brash and unsubtle of them is clearly Funny Games. It forgoes the building of suspense or mystery; it doesn't lay down breadcrumbs for the audience to pick up or confront them with possibilities to unlocking new answers. It is Haneke at his most uninhibited. This is simultaneously the film's triumph and downfall. Haneke employs a certain grit and cold realism that reinforces the brutality and sadism of the film's violence. There is no non-deigetic sound, only silence to accentuate the harsh screams and cries of pain that ring around the halls, and he utilises long-takes of such agonising length and desperation that we become transported into the scene itself, hurriedly glancing behind our shoulders as if Peter and Paul might return at any moment, golf club in hand. The most telling sign of Haneke's success in this department is the backlash towards the film. It cannot be more obvious in the reactions of those who call the film's action a depraved and sadistic affair, or mindless garbage, that they have been long coaxed by what Haneke is trying to disarm himself: the flashy, aestheticised violence and carefully cultivated endings of today's blockbusters. The modernist form also lends itself an aesthetic self-consciousness and reflexivity, and an acute awareness of its own origins and contextual influences of the past. Haneke cleverly weaves this aspect into his own battle; through Paul's breakings of the fourth wall, goading and questioning their audience and ensuring their complicity with what is being portrayed on the screen. A bet is made to signify the commodification of all that is great in violence. This is not, of course, a mutual agreement - Haneke posits that our desensitisation towards violence is so great that none of us should have any problem with what we are watching, and so from this he builds and builds. It's a grumpy old man within that can't quite resist or hold back in his agenda, and won't actually stop until every member of the audience has left. But the film is positioned so that with either reaction, he comes away victorious. Avert your eyes, walk out of the theatre (not that many went in the first place), or switch the television off, and his entire argument is justified, in that modern depictions of screen violence are little more than artefacts to stimulate, arouse and then placate our desires. One senses that Haneke looks upon this reaction with a little smugness. And yet stay and revel (if you can) for the entire runtime of Funny Games, and Haneke is allowed to brand you with disgust and the sadomasochistic label. Clearly, if you enjoy and sit and watch the whole thing, you're beyond the mere problem of the media's saturation of graphic violence and need a lot more intervention. So Haneke sets himself up to have his cake and eat it too, and the most intriguing moment in the film reinforces this notion of omniscient control that he asserts. George Junior somehow manages to acquire a shotgun and wield it competently, and sends Peter flying with a cartoonishly exaggerated shot straight into the wall. Haneke dangles the bait, that promise of vengeance and retribution, and then without any precedent, magically rewinds and erases the moment. This is a power move, the cinematic equivalent of Haneke flipping the bird to any viewer left that was foolish enough to hope and dream for that conventional third act resolution. Ultimately Funny Games is basically comprised of these moments - it doesn't enable the seductive powers of storytelling and characterisation and then turn them onto their backs, like Ribbon and Caché were structured. It's an endurance test of your moralities, and at the end of it no one is declared the winner. Except for Haneke himself, who must be positively delighted at all the outrage and controversy. Haneke's own 2007 American remake of the same film is a whole other conundrum. It is, in a nutshell, ideologically bankrupt. Here is a director who has denounced the mainstream, and would be sorely ashamed to sell out at the box office or win an Oscar, but then throws fifteen million into what is basically a meaningless experiment. Not only it is pathetic to watch Haneke wrest with what he should be opposed to, the soulless aimless American remake, but in the process of it the film's agenda is considerably diminished. Everything is cleaner - the actors are prettier, the sets are spotless, the murderers are more charismatic. They stalk through the sleek white decor of the lake house with a devilish grin, and by aestheticising them Haneke has succumbed to his own accusations. And in casting Hollywood stars in leading roles in Roth and Watts, he has commercialised what he vehemently argued beforehand should not be commercialised.Funny Games (1997) - 7/10Funny Games (2007) - 3/10",Funny Games
41,KnightsofNi11,Not what you will expect,8,9 August 2010,"One of the most terrifying feelings in the world is utter helplessness. Knowing you can't do a single thing about the situation you are in and nothing good is going to come of it is such a harrowing and painful thing to think about. Funny Games hones in on these emotions and then unexpectedly breaks a different ground. The movie is about a family who travel to their lovely vacation home, only to be terrorized by two sadistic and purely evil human beings. The movie explores deep and awful violence, sadism, and terror. It is not an easy film to stomach because of the realistically astonishing way it depicts violence.Going into the film I had no idea what it was about and was amazed at what it entailed. It is a social commentary, but not in the way you would expect. It is not a commentary about modern society, but a commentary of the cinematic medium itself. The film utilizes a technique called breaking the fourth wall. This means breaking the wall between the actors and the audience and speaking directly to them. This technique practically comes out of nowhere and seems out of place until you read in to what the film is truly about at its dark center. That is really all I want to say about that, so as not to give away anything.Funny Games is a fantastic film to become immersed in and elicit the responses that German director Michael Haneke wanted from it. It has a great sense of direction that finds shock and intrigue in the most unexpected places. Don't try to dislike this film as you watch it. Let yourself be engulfed in the disturbing atmosphere of this film that reaches to new heights of this creative storytelling medium. This film is so captivating and it is all done so stylistically with the utmost care. The direction here is superb and stands out a great deal. The long takes (one of which lasts around 15 minutes) serve to draw in the audience and force them to deal with the situation as much as the characters have to. It's rough to watch and beats at your emotions in a frustrating way. I've never seen a film quite like this. It breaks all the rules of traditional storytelling, yet in an impressive and captivating way.I'm sure most of this review has made little to no sense, so all I can say is go watch Funny Games and see for yourself this extremely different method of storytelling that is as interesting as it is horrific. It's a fantastic movie that will unexpectedly raise questions and ideas in your mind about violence and its use in movies.",Funny Games

44,Libretio,Confrontational horror takes no prisoners,7,9 March 2000,"FUNNY GAMES Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalJust over an hour into Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES, the tale of a middle-class couple and their son who are held hostage and tormented in their isolated holiday cottage by two young psychopaths, something happens which is *so* appalling, you'll either walk away from the film in abject horror or be completely ensnared by Haneke's audacity. This is a movie which dares to confront its audience with the realistic consequences of a sustained murderous assault whilst refusing to display the act of violence itself. Haneke has said he didn't want to make a film which exploited the hypocrisy of a sensation-hungry audience by wallowing in the kind of on-screen brutality which caused him to make FUNNY GAMES in the first place. In truth, the film relies more on the *threat* of violence than anything else, with the worst horrors depicted off-screen, often just out of camera range. But the resulting trauma - both physical and mental - lingers heavily throughout, with the husband virtually crippled and the wife blasted into a kind of emotional deadness by their nightmarish ordeal. When *that* scene comes around (believe me, you'll know it when you see it), you'll probably begin to understand how she feels.As much as you may be insulted by Haneke's point of view - his film is an antidote to the sanitised, beautifully choreographed violence of Hollywood movies and the audiences who lap them up - he's certainly got a point. People *do* seek out violent entertainment, while most filmmakers refuse to depict the awful consequences of that violence, thereby distorting our perceptions of it in an increasingly media-saturated, image-dominated society. FUNNY GAMES was first unveiled to shocked audiences at Cannes in 1997, where a huge number of patrons walked out during the screening. Since then, the film has been equally championed and condemned by divided critics who have practically fallen over themselves to warn prospective viewers of its horrific content. So if you seek it out on the strength of these admonitions, then Haneke was right all along. Like slowing down at a traffic accident, very few of us can resist the temptation...Aside from Haneke's deceptively straightforward approach to the material (his camera remains stationary for the most part and simply observes the action, while a couple of Hitchcockian suspense scenes are deliberately underplayed), much of the film's success is due to the magnificent, Oscar-calibre performances. Whatever else you might think about the production, there's no denying the quiet menace of Arno Frisch as the bland, emotionless killer Paul), the awkward simplicity of Frank Giering as Frisch's demented partner in crime, and the bewildered victim Ulrich Muhe. But the real stand-out is Susanne Lothar as the tortured wife; her dreadful agonies are so utterly convincing, you simply won't believe she's acting! Paradoxically, it's also one of the reasons why FUNNY GAMES is often so unbearable to watch.See the film, buy the DVD, make up your own mind.

It's shocking, brutal, a torture to watch and really exceptional. Well, it was certainly an exceptional topic for an Austrian movie to deal with, but ""Funny Games"" couldn't really convince me. Haneke (or whoever is responsible for the cast) made the mistake to choose an absolutely horrible actor for the role of one of the bad guys (Arno Frisch, who had already been in Haneke's ""Benny's Video"", where his bad acting could be forgiven considering his young age then). That way the movie, that works like a stage play could not unfold like it should have. I wouldn't go as far as saying that Frisch' amateurish performance lead to unintended comedy but it certainly defeated the horror that should have been created in our minds. All the other actors were great, however (except for the kid, who can be forgiven considering his age) and Haneke's direction was pretty good, too. I don't exactly know why he would let the actors talk to the audience or rewind certain scenes, though. I think in the end he tried to tell us that psychopaths like the two in the movie are existing in real life, too and that we, the audience, oughta be scared and disturbed. Maybe he tried to say the exact opposite. Whatever. Maybe I had too high hopes for ""Funny Games"" because ""La pianiste"", a later Haneke-movie, really impressed me. Maybe it's the fact that watching Tarantino, ""True Romance"", ""Natural Born Killers"" and several eastern movies has blunted me, but ""Funny Games"" failed to disturb me in any way.",Funny Games
47,raymond-15,An engrossing thriller,8,12 August 2002,"For me, entertainment value is of prime importance and the deciding factor in assessing a film..  This film really has it.Held hostage in their own holiday house, Georg and Anna with their son Georg Jnr are terrorised and humiliated at the hands of a couple of neighbouring vindictive brats who like to play games with their innocent victims.  May be this is not a new scenario but it's well done. Starting with an argument over some eggs, the tension quickly mounts between the family and the intruders.  A golf iron  suddenly becomes a lethal weapon, the husband is immobolised and the family's german shepherd is killed.  A series of games then takes over as a form of entertainment for the grinning terrorists.  First of all the ""hot and cold"" search game, then a game of check the ""flab"" on the wife as she is forced to strip off her clothes.  This is just the beginning of more terror and more humiliation as the family realises that they are completely isolated from any outside help.This film treats violence in a different way - the director has seen to that.  We never see the actual impact of a fist or boot or bullet or the smashing blow of a golf club or the bashing of a fractured leg or for that matter   we never see the naked body of the wife.  The director takes control of our minds and manipulates us cleverly so that the tears and the pain are horrifyingly real to us.  It is also a great credit to the actors in this cat and mouse game that they are able to maintain the atmosphere of terror over such a long period.I suspect that this film is based on a stage play for it is virtually played on a single set with a few outdoor scenes added.  The use of the ""off stage"" technique for the violence is rather unique these days when audiences are fed the intimate details to the last drop of blood.  The human mind however is quite capable and is indeed expert at filling in the gaps with moments of violence beyond our wildest dreams.",Funny Games

The film is less artful and clever than those which it had in its sights, that's the real crime here. Those are films are typically cheap, exploitative schlock.Some of the other endorsing reviews here are like competent legal defense, more thought and effort put into their statements than went into the actual act perpetuated by their client.If one is supposed to feel that all crime, fictional or on film is crime, and the viewer/reader is thus an accomplice, then Haneke doesn't present his case very well. To me the ""wink"" in the film is less one that ties the audience together with the character in that scene, instead that scene aligned the director with that character.A smug delight in what they were creating...And to think afterwards Haneke just hopped in a boat and committed the same crime in America. Seriously the fact that this got remade in 2007 was more shocking than anything in the movie to me.Is this the only film with Eye from the Boredoms on the soundtrack, now that's a crime.",Funny Games
49,asda-man,The moral of the story is: Don't let ANYONE borrow your eggs!,9,12 February 2013,"I actually saw the remake of Funny Games first, as it was on Film4 and obviously they're going to show the American one with A-list actors because who's going to want to see a load of nobody's whilst reading? You may as well find yourself a nice book! Of course if you can't tell I'm being sarcastic for I love foreign films. However, I fail to see why people have such strong feelings against the remake because it is shot-for-shot and line-for-line the same, and you can't go saying that it's a rip-off because Michael Haneke wrote and directed both versions of the film himself. I'm guessing he saw Funny Games as an important film (which it most definitely is!) and so decided to remake it for a slightly lazier English-speaking audience. It's certainly better than dubbing!Anyway I finally decided to buy the original as the remake is one of my favourites any way and I might say that I found the original slightly better, just for the pure fact that it's unknown actors in the roles (maybe apart from Ulriche, because I've seen him in a few things) which makes everyone seem quite ordinary, thus adding to the already stark realism. I also think that Naomi Watts is too attractive to be playing the ordinary mother. Also, this version fells slightly grittier because of the older cameras. None of this HD lark in our day kids! (I don't know why I'm saying that, I'm only 18 myself!) Despite all these differences the content and directing is exactly the same which is the most important part by far!It took me a while to actually understand the message of Funny Games when I first saw it (I was probably way too young!) but now I can appreciate it's clear and important message on violence in the media, and why we want to watch it. There's a great moment of profound realism when the camera doesn't move, and the actors barely move for what feels like 10 minutes! You suddenly realise that is watching a couple suffer like this really entertainment? It's certainly hard-hitting and extremely brave. Funny Games almost feels like a simulated home invasion film. It makes you think that this could be you, and it's a terrifying thought.The introduction to our two psychopaths is an oddly compelling one. I say oddly because it starts with a conversation about borrowing some eggs and for some reason it's a really compelling scene. The camera barely moves so you feel yourself becoming slowly immersed into the story and you know that something is going to escalate soon, and it does, spectacularly. The psychopathic duo (Peter and Paul or Tom and Jerry or Beavis and Butthead as they're called throughout the film) are supremely chilling due to their lack of empathy. They're also very polite, making them quite different to your average killers. It's later revealed that, through that wonderful technique of breaking the fourth wall, they're terrorising this family for our entertainment. How postmodern I hear you say! Bodger's probably having a postmodern attack right this second!Things unfold in a gripping manner. Whilst some shots may feel like they're going on for too long, that is also the beauty of the film, as it makes it feel so real and involving. At times it feels like a live stream of Big Brother without the birds tweeting in the background! It's very disturbing, and succeeds in being disturbing with very little use of on-screen violence. Funny Games is wildly unpredictable as it breaks all the conventions of a home invasion film so you really have no idea what's going to happen next. The film ends so suddenly and is actually very upsetting to behold. It's also full of suspense and has some seriously thrilling moments.It's clear from the opening titles that this is going to be no ordinary film as we hear such high-culture opera in the very middle-class car which then gets marred with some screaming death metal music. It's creepy, yet humorous at the same time. Funny Games possesses such immense power and it's an experience you're unlikely to forget. However if you're inexperienced with this type of genre then you may be in for a shock. I still find this film shocking despite having seen such home invasion shockers such as Inside and Mother's Day. Nevertheless it's an extremely important film, and one which I'd recommend.",Funny Games

This film is one completely intense ride that recalls some of the most brutal home-invasion horror films of the 70's. However, unlike most tales of madness and torture Funny Games is a story that's played out in such a realistic nature. If it were a true story re-enactment of a real crime, it wouldn't surprise me. In fact that would be about the only way that this unsettling shocker could have had a bigger impact. There are moments of incredible suspense in this film and such an atmosphere of overwhelming tension that it becomes almost unbearable at times. The film has some off-beat moments of cheeky dark humor with our villains, they refer to each other by cartoon character names and there's one particularly memorable twist involving a remote control that reverses the film! Michael Haneke's direction is very simplistic, there is no music score and the camera work is generally basic (one tense shot lasting nearly ten minutes). This however adds all the most to the film's chilling feeling of realism.The strong performances of the cast add all the more to the believability. Susanne Lothar is outstanding as the terrorized housewife and mother. Arno Frisch is effectively creepy as the calm madman who torments the family.

The second Austrian made film I've seen in the last two weeks (I know, odd), 'Funny Games' starts off as an ideal summer cabin getaway for an average family of three. There's the mother (Susanne Lother), the father (Ulrich Melhe) and the nine-year-old boy. After they get settled into their cabin they are slyly taken hostage by two deranged early-twenty-something boys, Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering). Both boys are absolutely deranged and their motives seem unclear, but during the 24-hour captive of the family, the boys torture the innocent family as well as make them play weird, deranged perhaps even ""funny"" (to them) games with each other. 'Funny Games' is a maddening film in many respects because it has no idea what it wants to be. Is it a drama? Is it a thriller? Is it a horror film? Is it a dark comedy? Is it a social commentary? Perhaps all of these things wrapped into one. 'Funny Games' holds your attention with exquisite acting from the enormous cast of five, haunting cinematography and unpredictable plot twists.

And the independent films is a way for them to cut their teeth in and if the director, acting crew and writing team use what they have in the best way then you can get something like the now famous examples of Evil Dead(1981) , Reservoir Dogs(1992) ,Mad Max(1977), Memento (2000), The Terminator (1984) and many more and this film is also in to this category.The experienced TV director Micheal Haneke tried for the first time to direct of feature film and using his limited resources he made this small but very well paced, chilling film. In short he used his experienced working on a TV set which lacks usually space in to make feel the stress, fear and shock about this home invasion. Another great part of the film are the antagonists especially Arno Frisch due to his attitude and intelligence that makes him both intimidating dispute his slender physic and the plump body of his friend.Over all it is a very good independent film and I recommended to very film buff.",Funny Games

Two intellectuals terrorize a family on holiday with the usual results. Its all been done before and much better. The filmmaker fails to see that what makes a shockingly disturbing movie watchable is making sure it aint so damn realistic! Cause nobody wants to be subjected to that. Nobody sane at any least. While the violence is mostly implied, omitting it only adds to the realism by forcing your imagination to fill in he missing pieces. Graphically displaying violence, as American audiences and filmmakers know cartoonizes it, makes it almost a joke, a walk through the haunted house at the carnival. It would seem this film bends over backwards to do the opposite by giving it an almost documentary if not snuff feel. The director tries to amuse us and remind us we are at the cinema by having the villains talk, smirk and joke with us. The old fourth wall gimmick. Not that it ever suceeds, but here it completely backfires, as it instead makes you an unwilling accomplice to their atrocities. This just may be culture gap, for all i know it won the Austrian Oscar, but my advice is spare yourself the bother. see Hitchcock's Rope instead.",Funny Games
58,Med-Jasta,Different then I thought...,7,15 November 2021,"I thought this movie was going to be two psychos making a family torment each other with distributing acts of violence. But that's not it. In fact we hardly even see the violence, which is somehow more disturbing. But the movie is a very well done and horrific suspense movie. I was glued to the screen the whole time.Now I don't agree with the message of the movie. Or what I think the message is: that movie violence leads to real life violence. And I think that's a well known fact now that it doesn't. But it the 90s this was a hot topic. I think bad people generally like violent movies but they don't act on them because of what they've watched. You have to consider all the people that watch the same movies and don't behave violently. And you know the fact that things are much less violent now than they were before movies even existed.Of course when the movie ended I was like, ""That's it?"" So I think I ""enjoyed"" this movie as much as anyone could. I won't watch it again and I won't recommend it to anyone. I'll talk about it though. A lot probably.The breaking of the fourth wall was strange and funny. The first one was very funny and threw me off balance. But as most forth wall breaks do, they went too far. The rewinding of the scene made it go from a nod to the audience to literally rewiring the movie and... It was weird and frankly annoying and kinda killed it for me.I guess the point was that this violence in real life is going to continue because that's what we really want to see. And how can we get a happy ending when we don't get them in real life? Thought provoking stuff. And I applaud the ambition for sure. I finished it, which is saying a lot. I yelled by myself at the screen when the wife kills the bad guy. Only to have my yells of joy shoved back down my throat. Haha.I really liked the lack of score and the long motionless shots. It really added to the reality. Not only so you get to see the scenes play out but also so it felt like you were there watching. Especially that long shot in in the middle after the kid dies. Now that's a long shot. These days directors do ""single takes"" that are really several shots edited to look like one for some reason. But the point of not cutting is why they do it in this movie. For the reality. It may have been a little too long but the effect was achieved.I'm no psychologist but I've read a lot about sociopaths and this seemed very accurate. They have little excitement in their lives and do extreme (violent) things to excite themselves. This and on par. Even the way that they talked to the family. Staying calm and blaming them for causing them to hurt them.I'm all for a movie having a message but the message can't be the reason the movie is good. You can't say, ""Well this movie is good because..."" And I hate to say that this applies to this movie. It should still work as a movie on it's own.",Funny Games
59,Danny_G13,Genius,10,18 January 2007,"Psychological horror masterpiece presses all the right buttons to disturb at an epidermal level.On the surface of this movie, the mere plot about two psychopaths terrorising a family doesn't seem to be particularly interesting, or critically, original either. Indeed, the fact that the entire story takes place in pretty much one place would suggest it might struggle to capture the viewer's attention, certainly for its duration.However, the simple combination of the mechanics of the performances, the script and the general tension make this story work outstandingly well; indeed, its isolated feel simply adds to the overall claustrophobia.Peter and Paul are two apparently genial young men, who show up at the isolated boathouse of Anna and Georg, a mature couple with a child, who are all taking a couple of weeks holiday.When Peter seems to be making a nuisance of himself, Anna starts to lose her patience with him. Paul then arrives on the scene and before long it has converted from an underbelly of irritation to outright intimidation, followed by crude violence.It is extremely hard to sum this movie up without making it sound like a highly unoriginal piece of cinema, but there can be no question it is anything but.The script is simply incredible; the overtone of terror slowly creeps up on the viewer, and on Anna and Georg, with more than a dose of psychological manipulation. Almost by pretending they are doing nothing wrong, with more than a hint of cordiality along the way, the two perpetrators manage to inflict a disturbing level of fear upon the family, and yet it is the most subtle form of assault.Rather than constant threats, the two act like dinner guests who just happen to be terrifying the heck out of their hosts.When things go further, and violence joins in, it takes the trauma to a new level, as it is gritty horror rather than a splatterfest. These are two psychos who take intimidation, violence, and all round fear to a thoroughly psychological pane.The movie is also laced with some deliciously dark humour, with a few addresses to camera by Paul, who steps out of the character and joins the viewer on occasion. Absolutely marvellous.However, it cannot be forgotten that the performances all round are simply outstanding. Each actor plays their part to perfection, and hats off to all - the victims were especially convincingly terrified, and the perpetrators frighteningly cool.Haneke, the director, delivered a masterpiece with this. It's not conventional, doesn't end traditionally, and makes superb use of direction to construct an honestly masterful affair.Highly recommended, but it should be noted it's not for everyone.",Funny Games
60,GeorgeRoots,"Arguably The Most Realistic Home Invasion Movie, That's Guaranteed To P*ss You Off.",7,24 September 2014,"""Funny Games"" and I have a history. Back in 2012 when I was 20 years old, I viewed the American remake of ""Funny Games U.S"" (2007) and hated it with a passion. Why did they not fight back? Why did they not make a getaway at the very moment the invaders leave? Finally an act of defence is instantly ""rewound"", and I felt I had been spat in the face. Jump to 2014, and now more fully aware of director Michael Haneke's original intentions. He wanted to make a movie set in the United States, but for budgetary reasons had to settle for Austria. The entire film was also not intended to be a horror film, saying he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie.Two young men hold a family hostage, and begin to torture them with sadistic games. The men proceed to break mundane cliché's typically seen in horror movies, and also make a bet that the 3 family members will be dead by 9.am the following morning. The leader Paul (Arno Frisch) constantly breaks the fourth wall, addressing the slim chances they have as well as your expectations of how the events usually pan out.""Funny Games"" runs at a smooth pace blurring reality and fantasy, remaining a very dialogue driven and beautifully shot story. All the tropes of the genre are laid out and after viewing both versions twice, I can confidently say I adore the original and still don't think much of that remake. I respect the shot for shot decisions, love that they replicate the sets to a tee and I adore those actors (Tim Roth, Naomi Watts, Michael Pitt). Still, I remain very put off a by a lot of what I considered short comings. Final Verdict: ""Funny Games"" goes against the rules and comes off more as a parody. In a lot of ways it could be the most violent torture flick ever, and very little blood is actually seen. I respect what Michael Haneke set out to do and in the recent waves of typical horror movies nowadays, I'm glad this exists to point out how mundane all this excessive violence really is. 7/10.",Funny Games
61,ilpohirvonen,One who watches Haneke's Funny Games just as a thriller will be hugely disappointed,7,28 May 2010,"Many see Michale Haneke as a challenging director. He makes films that are hard to watch, hard to understand and he challenges the viewer to observe and think. I would say that Cache (2005) and Funny Games (1997) are his most accessible films. Cache because it doesn't break any huge traditions of narrative (even that a lot does happen below the surface). Funny Games because of its way of achieving excitement, the mystery and, the suspense whether there will be violence or not. But Haneke does use his own unique narrative and Funny Games is not an easy pill to swallow. It achieves to create very distressing scenes, challenge the viewer and through that make the viewer distressed. Michael Haneke's cruel psychological thriller doesn't give any chance for the viewer to entertain around the violence.A bourgeois family (mom, dad and son) set out to have a peaceful weekend at their idyllic vacation apartment. When the dad goes to fix their boat with his son, a young polite man comes to ask four eggs from the mother. Eventually the discussion starts having unpleasant features and another man comes to the apartment. When the dad and the son come to the apartment, the situation breaks out of control. Soon the family is in a cruel game, which isn't funny at all.Michael Haneke often takes an idyllic family to the center of his film. For instance in Cache (2005) he destroys the illusion of bourgeois peace. A major theme in his films is the part of wealthy Europeans in the world's suffering of the poor. In Funny Games he destroys their life - the family faces their worst nightmare. This destruction of bourgeois peace is clearly showed to us in the beginning: mom and dad drive in a car listening to classical music and trying to guess who's the composer, funny game right? Then suddenly we have to listen to a loud, screaming grind-core song. A very impressive start for a film, and one of the finest introductions I've seen in modern cinema. It's really a basic thing in the theory of film; to introduce the leading theme for the viewer in the very beginning, but still many new filmmakers seem to neglect this.Funny Games is a slap in the face. Slap in the face of American media violence. We see violence everywhere; in TV, news, internet, movies etc. In Funny Games Haneke doesn't give any chance for the audience to entertain while watching the violence. At some points it's unbearable, very hard to watch, for some at least. Those who can watch it without feeling distressed are the people Haneke here criticizes; a person who likes to watch violence like this is a slave of the modern society and, its media violence. One of the cruel men even asks once in a while ""What do you want?,"" from the audience. He takes straight contact with us. What do WE actually want to see? If we love watching violent entertainment, let's. Michale Haneke always challenges the viewer in his films. He makes us think our own part in the film, but in Funny Games this happens very directly. It's post modernism, a brand of philosophy where reality is subjective and, there is no one single almighty reality. Funny Games also includes a lot of philosophical thinking. What is actually the reality. It mixes truth and fiction with the reality. It can be watched as a slap in the face of media violence but it also deals with European bourgeois life. A fascinating film, probably very hard to watch for some, since it doesn't give any relief to the audience, if it does, it instantly takes it away. I would recommend this to all lovers of cinema but I don't consider it as Haneke's finest. If you are going to watch Funny Games just as a thriller you will be hugely disappointed and, if you watch it like that you are exactly the ones who receive this slap in the face. Because you won't find any motives of the psychos, you won't find any conventional twists or solutions. You should look below the surface.",Funny Games
62,Meven_Stoffat,Art house 101 for ignorant elitist nilhists who evidently are cinematically sheltered,1,24 January 2011,"A little over a month ago, I saw a film called ""Devil"". In it, a group of people are stuck in an elevator that has come to a dead stop, presumably because the presence of the devil is in with them. Throughout the movie, the people act dumb and just stand there wondering what to do, as opposed to actually doing anything, getting slaughtered one by one. They just START to act towards the end, and that's mainly when we find out who the Devil in question is.If you're following me, you should have a similar idea of what Funny Games is like.A family of 3 go on vacation to a nearby lake. They're a perfectly happy family, or so it seems. That is until the backstreet boys... whoops, I mean two boys visit them and they're all nice. Apparently the ma has had enough of them, and even getting the pop to remove them won't work. How do they respond? Whacking him in the leg. WITH A GOLF CLUB.The dad COULD respond by fighting back. Instead, he just moans and groans and hugs his leg because he's so scared he's going to get killed by the evil golf club of doom. I will also point out that there are 2 bags worth of golf clubs, but the wife is dumb enough not to GRAB ONE AND USE IT AS DEFENSE.Throughout all this pointless time of fourth wall breaking and pretentiousness, the family could be responding by fighting back, but no, all they can do is weep and moan at the evil golf club of doom. The wife is forced to strip down and the son is blasted away with a shot gun, all because they couldn't do anything to defend themselves.Oh, but then the two creeps leave for a short period of time. Good, they can do something to defend themselves, right? Like, grab one of the kitchen knives, create a barricade,or best of all, GET IN THE CAR AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, right? No. NO. Capital N, Capital O.Instead they spend what seems like an hour blowdrying a phone. When they can use it, instead of saying something like ""911, police!!! Two crazy teenagers are invading our home!!! Please get to (address) as soon as possible!!!"", they spend what seems like an eternity shouting ""HELLO???? HELLO????"" into the phone. And because of it, when the two psychos come back, it's back to the game.Oh, I will give the mom credit for manning up and grabbing the gun!!! Oh wait, she only shot one of them and because she apparently, for unknown reasons to the viewer, can't shoot the other, the other grabs a remote and rewinds it. I KID YOU NOT.I could go on and on, but I'm just getting angry about it. I, for once, am getting tired of movies where a group of people is terrorized and they aren't smart enough to defend themselves. Apparently this was the intention of Haneke, as he usually beats his viewer over the head with the theme because we're too dumb and can only watch a simplified story. Either way, avoid this trash. The only thing more terrifying than two teenage boys terrorizing a family with a golf club is a house full of morons who aren't smart enough to defend themselves.",Funny Games

It is an Austrian film directed by Michael Haneke. It is a story about a family that gets taken hostage by two young men that torture them physically and psychologically by making them play sadistic games. The film is not unique in its setup. It's a home invasion horror thriller but the film's tone is very bleak and doesn't give the audience the payoff that this type of film usually gives. It isn't ""entertaining"" in a suspense thriller kind of way. The director wants to make the audience uncomfortable and indicts us on being participants and loving violence on film. The film is a commentary on violence in film and how we glorify it. One of the characters. Paul, one of the villains breaks the fourth wall and brings the audience in. Asking us who we're rooting for. Also there is a scene where he rewinds what just happened because the film will not give us what we expect. No win. No relief. Even though this technique is clever and gets the director's point about violence across it makes the whole situation feel like a joke. The tone of the film is so bleak and disturbing that I feel that the breaking of the fourth wall reduces that bleakness and just becomes satire.

Mainly because Michael Haneke's film is so relentless and brutal in it's message! The long takes of certain scenes were deliberately excruciating and emphasised the brutality of the situation!This a claustrophobic film that is very suspenseful, and even haunting. It leaves you thinking about how people like Anna and Georg make errors that literally changes their lives! It also makes you think about the hopelessness of the situation, and that you should never rely on 'hope'- seize the opportunity to escape! Those who have seen the film will know what I mean! In a way, Anna and Georg's failure to seize opportunities, continued Peter and Paul's vicious cycle!This film is excellent! A must-see for performances and direction if you can stomach it!

66,akash_sebastian,Brilliant film; Pushes the viewer to an extreme.,8,30 August 2015,"Michael Haneke's 'Funny Games' is the kind of film which splits viewers into two extremes. And no matter what people think of it, there's no denying that it's a brilliantly made film, and in my opinion, it's really clear in its point.In the movie, we see two robbers/killers disguised as well-seeming gentlemen, who invade the house of a three-member family to torture and play ""funny"" games with them. And it's never clearly explored why they do all this, and that's the main point Haneke makes - ""senseless violence"". I'm not against every kind of violence depicted in various forms of art and media, and I don't think Haneke is as well. If the violence is explored in detail, serves a purpose, depicted in context, and not just as a random or stylized act in an action or slasher film, I'm okay with it. And as a rebuke to such violence, Haneke tests us by subjecting us to a movie with almost no plot and unexplained violence. He remade this film in 2007 for an English-speaking audience; I wish someone remakes this film in countries like India, where any sort of violence is okay on screen, but anything related to sex is still so censored.Through the film, Haneke has an interesting dialogue with the viewer. The way Paul (on the the young men) winks at the viewers or asks them questions, catching one in a voyeuristic trance of violence and making one question the reason for their presence there, was really interesting. Whether it's just to see where the story goes, or to explore the true intentions of the two men, or to see if the family makes out safely after killing the two sadistic torturers, I actually found myself thinking these questions from time to time. And despite all that, Haneke plays with his viewers in exactly the same way the two men do with the hostage family, except maybe, the former has a purpose. Quite a few escape opportunities or situational clues are shown for us to assume them to be of some importance, but they are snatched away one by one and revealed to be red herrings.The acting is really good. Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Muhe are incredible as the helpless couple, Frank Giering is commendable as the chubby and childlike Peter, and Arno Frisch is amazing as the calm, cold-hearted and sadistic Paul; he's so good that there numerous moments that provoke us to punch him on the face, or even kill him. And that's when I realized that the film, maybe, also tries to test our own morals and ask ""What constitutes as a justifiable reason to kill someone?""",Funny Games
67,frankwiener,Cracked Eggs,2,16 July 2018,"SPOILER ALERTS!!! (How could I possibly spoil these eggs any more than they are already?)I rated this a ""2"" instead of a ""1"" in honor of the Austrian director's ability to suck me into the action for at least the first 75 minutes, maybe more, which alternated between one of the most repulsive and boring cinematic experiences that I can remember.My instincts told me to click this off immediately after Anna discovered her beloved German shepherd in the back of the Range Rover, but I kept going anyway, in spite of the fact that two of my very best friends in real life were German shepherds. Always trust your instincts, folks, at least when you feel that you need to switch off a movie, an act that doesn't come very easy to me.In addition to Ben Mankiewicz, my very favorite Hollywood leftwing poster child, reviewers who liked this total mess claim that the director, Michael Haneke, was making a very important statement about American horror films. I missed the point entirely. Whether it's Karloff's ""Frankenstein"" of 1935 or ""Psycho"" of 1960 or hundreds of entertaining horror films in between and after, my attraction to the American horror genre is not based on revolting, graphic scenes of blood and terror but on the art of developing suspense and fear within the viewer. It does not lie in a director's pathetic attempt to allow his psychopathic character to speak to me robotically and repeatedly ""out here in the dark"", as Norma Desmond, a kind of horror figure in her own right, would say. It certainly does not exist in the image of an innocent child lying lifelessly in a pool of blood for ten or fifteen minutes with absolutely no action on the screen other than a televised car race.For me, this film became a dreadful and even traumatic experience that I was finally forced to end it on my own. As controversial as this statement may be, this is a film that only an Austrian or German director could enjoy making. If he didn't enjoy making it, why even bother, especially when the intended message was so ineffective for so many of us? ""Funny Games"" was no fun for me.",Funny Games

The young boy attempts to run away, and tries to shoot one of the men, but unfortunately the gun is empty. The most notable thing about the film is that one of the intruders, at times, looks at the camera and winks, and also asks us what we think, as though we are fascinately entangled inside with them. There's another scene where the women struggles free, and shoots one of the intruders, the other one then grabs the TV remote control and rewinds to the beginning of the sequence, as if to say, 'hey we are going to prevail here, come what may'.

The audience has no escape from the situation, other than finishing the movie or turning it off.The evildoers talk directly to the camera, breaking the fourth wall, and exercise full control over the universe of the movie. They are even able to turn back time if something goes wrong for them. Our sympathies lie with the ordinary, innocent people who happened to cross paths with them, but the movie shows no mercy. It revels in the pain of the family, the pain of losing a family member, the pain of helplessness as you are forced to watch on. It asks, 'Why do we do this? What do we gain by seeing this fictional violence on screen?' and we find that we have no good reason to give.The movie is fully carried by the actors' performances.

Recent examples have been THE STRANGERS and EDEN LAKE. It's not that they're sadistic... I can enjoy a good bit of brutal violence for its own sake. After all, that's what slasher films are for. What bothers me is when people try to make these movies with a straight face... to present them ""realistically."" Michael Myers maybe be ""scary"" but c'mon, who is seriously going to have his soul disturbed by that? HALLOWEEN is, by its very nature, cartoonish on a level. We know this and this is why we are entertained by it, despite its violence.But films like THE STRANGERS and EDEN LAKE attempt to plunge us into reality and make us sick to our stomachs. They don't want to entertain. They merely wish to sicken. I can enjoy this kind of film while viewing but, overall, I recognize it as a forgettable exercise in futility.Now, along comes Haneke, a self-serving Austrian with a hilariously overblown sense of self-righteousness, and he doesn't like these films any more than I do. In fact, he really hates them. Ya can't imagine how much... And he wants us all to see why he hates them. So what does he do? He makes one of the films of the type he hates, and he fills them with all sorts of IDIOTIC post-modern dog crap such as characters ""breaking the fourth wall"" by addressing the audience, scenes being rewound and replayed with different outcomes (the characters make sure to tell us why this is happening). Anyone with an iota of intelligence should be...well, not insulted, exactly. That would be giving Haneke too much credit. Amused, is more like it. Bored. Annoyed. You will experience a subtle feeling of having been taken for a sucker.I can imagine Haneke with an expression on his face as if he had a lemon stuffed in his mouth, wagging the finger at us for the entire worthless two hours of his sad little attempt at an anti-violence lecture. He thinks by portraying realistic violence, we will see how ugly it really is. He thinks this because either he is too stupid or he believes we are too stupid to know that, in movies, violence is not SUPPOSED to be realistic. That's what the news are for.Skip this piece of crap, folks.",Funny Games
75,film_riot,Funny Games,7,18 September 2007,"""Funny Games"" is definitely one of those movies that divide audiences. It's controversial. Many of the reviewers seem to really hate this movie, and I have to say, that I also didn't really like it. But that cannot be understood in a negative way, because it's not meant to be a movie that is ""liked"". However, I do pay a lot of respect to Michael Haneke for bringing a statement that he really believes in to the big screen without making compromises. It is a movie that really has an opinion on violence in the media, an opinion I'm not quite sure to share, but I'm stunned by the artistry, with which Haneke makes this statement. If you're making a film that wants to teach things to its audience, it's difficult to stay on a certain level of subtlety. This is the point where Haneke seems to fail partly in ""Funny Games"". ""Caché"" on the other hand, which has a similar topic, was a full success. ""Funny Games"" is an important and talked-about film.",Funny Games
76,Renaldo Matlin,Gut-wrenching horror,10,14 March 2002,"As opposed to Oliver Stone's speculative box office hit NATURAL BORN KILLERS, that actually made us laugh and thus destroyed the whole threat of violence, Michael Haneke's FUNNY GAMES turns the art of cinema into a loaded gun. The movie hits you below the waist time after time, until you feel as helpless and molested as the characters on-screen. And thus Haneke's point that ""violence is bad"" is made terribly clear.Not an easy task, but Haneke pulled it off like there was no tomorrow, and for that he deserves our praise in a time when violence is synonymous with entertainment.See FUNNY GAMES - if you dare!",Funny Games
77,andrabem,a reflexion on violence,9,25 May 2007,"""Funny Games"" is a ""funny"" film, because it tells a violent story, but it doesn't show violence directly - what the camera registers is mild physical violence. The hardcore violence (so freely shown in television and in so many films) is implied by noises, splatters of blood etc.. Even a sexual humiliation scene is shown through the facial expressions of the character; in many other films the camera would show us the happenings. ""Funny Games"" is a very sober/serious film - the camera concentrates primarily on the characters and their immediate surroundings; the film doesn't try to appeal to our emotions and also it doesn't tell us what is right and what is wrong. It leaves room for the viewer to think and reach his/her own conclusions. When Hollywood shows violence, it is just for the entertainment of the audience - consequence: a film that is easy to like and easier to forget.There are films that really show violence, and have no restraint in showing it. One of these films is ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Much has been written about ""Cannibal Holocaust"" so I will just say one or two things. I like very much ""Cannibal Holocaust"" because it showed many things that the traditional movies avoid to show - It's a film that tries to cross visually our moral boundaries: Civilization? Barbary? The heart of darkness may be everywhere: inside and outside. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" shows us raw images of violence whose intention is really to shock, maybe shock us into thinking. But it is not a ""political"" film and it doesn't make political speeches. It is an exploitation film, but even so, I think that through this film Deodato and his team conveyed something that they felt deeply inside about this world - heart of darkness. Back to ""Funny Games"".I don't think either that ""Funny Games"" is a social indictment - there is no direct condemnation of the media's exploitation of violence. The films shows what happens in a detached way. ""Funny Games"" is not cynical, but it's clearly a film made by an intellectual. Only an intellectual (one could say a philosopher) would be able to tell this story with such a serene distance. The philosopher says: ""Violence comes like thunder. It strikes from the skies and can bring havoc. What can we do? I don't know. Anyway there's no god above and no hell below. Me, I am a film maker - I like to tell stories"".The story runs like this: A family on vacation goes to an isolated house by a lake and two guys pay them a visit. What begins innocently enough will develop into a game of cat and mouse - annoyance, perplexity, fear and then, panic and despair. Funny games will be played and the stakes grow higher and higher.....There are no good and bad characters - the film doesn't judge, it doesn't appeal for our ""tender feelings"" or easy indignation. A good example for ""Funny Games""'s style is its beginning - A car driving through a road, inside the car a couple with their son, they are playing classical music CDs for their enjoyment. Soft classical music and the green landscape provides the background for their conversation. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the soundtrack changes - wild punk music invades the screen. The couple go on talking, but we don't hear them anymore, we can see only their lips moving - frenetic music underlines the scene. A warning ... a slight feeling of estrangement. Funny games!The acting in ""Funny Games"" is overall excellent (especially Susanne Lothar as Anna) - one weak actor could have spoiled the whole film. A traditional American film would show more directly the violence but it would, at the same time, fill the story with moralism and ""good feelings"" and, of course, in the end the good..... Well, I guess no more need to be said.I wouldn't say that ""Funny Games"" is a masterpiece, but it will leave you puzzled - you'll have food for thought.",Funny Games
78,SeriousJest,A Very Dark Version of Scream,7,1 July 2014,"This film is like a very dark version of Scream. While I enjoy horror movies, haunted houses, etc, not many of them raise my heart rate anymore. A good thriller, however, may still get my blood pumping. Enter this unique take on the serial-killer thriller. Haneke uses a calculating and methodical tempo, a Hitchcock-style method of making your brain fill in the gore, and an expert contrast of peaceful music with obnoxious music to keep the viewer's eyes glued to the screen. The movie is like a soccer match: stretches of anticipation, with exciting moments happening very quickly and with little warning. I had the good fortune to watch the film without knowing what it was about, so those payoffs were even more exciting for me.And like Scream, while the director showcases his ability to make a proper killer thriller, he also sends a message to the viewer in a creative and artistic fashion. According to IMDb, Haneke told producer 'Veit Heiduschka' during the production that if the film was a success, it would be because audiences had misunderstood the meaning behind it. It could potentially get frustrating to watch a well-executed thriller color outside of the lines all of a sudden, but if you keep an open mind, you might realize that such creative license actually adds to the thrill.It would be wrong to end this review without mentioning the actors, who all performed very convincingly. A great game plan is of no use if the players don't execute it well.In closing, I would also be remiss not to mention what I saw as the most important lesson of all to take from this film: a man should have the physical ability and disposition to protect his family. Just ask Muhe's character. Moreover, when presented with a threat, passive compliance is not always the best answer. Act decisively and before your situation has worsened, and you might just catch the enemy in the OO of his OODA loop. Sometimes you just have to fight with a busted knee.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",Funny Games
79,MattBirk,Not so 'Funny Games',7,2 October 2014,"Though the movie might be too slow most of the time, 'Funy Games' packs a pretty strong and unusual punch! There are plenty of moments in the movie that will be sure to get you scream at the screen (not in a good way however, out of pure frustration at the hopelessness of the family). The story isn't terribly unique (though at the time in 1997, it probably was), two intruders take a small family hostage and together they psychologically and physically torture them. That may seem all too familiar, but director Michael Haneke adds some very unusual flair, most notably the main villain breaking the fourth wall multiple times and speaking directly at the audience. I can confidently say that 'Funny Games' is one of the best horror movies on the 1990s (though, as I commonly say, the 90s was the worst decade for horror movies)!Full Review at : http://www.simplefilmreviews.com/2014/09/funny-games- 1997.html",Funny Games
80,Hawkensian,"It's condescending in its ill-judged commentary, but 'Funny Games' is an undeniably gripping and powerful film.",7,9 August 2012,"'Funny Games' is one of the most provocative films I have ever seen, if not the most. Michael Haneke revisits themes of the media and desensitisation like he did in 'Benny's Video', however this time Haneke is directly confronting his audience about the violence they supposedly watch with relish. The antagonist of the film actually addresses the audience, asking 'Don't you want some plot development?', 'You're on their side, aren't you?' He needlessly injects this nasty film with condescension and pretension, and none of it really works, Haneke only succeeds in appearing smug and self-righteous. Haneke has said that he makes the viewer an 'accomplice' of the murderers. No he doesn't, not at all. Not once did I even begin to want to be an 'accomplice', the antagonists are some of the most wretched I've ever seen, it's nonsense. During the evil mind games that the killers inflict on the family, I felt like them, a victim, not an 'accomplice'. I, like any other viewer, was desperately hoping that the family could somehow escape their captors. The ill-judged provocation climaxes in a scene where Haneke 'manipulates' the audience, making them 'applaud' violence; but applauding is a completely justified response to the scene, which, without giving anything away, concerns the maiming of a truly reprehensible character. If Haneke himself was in Anna and Georg's situation, he'd be utterly liberated by what occurs; it is the film's most self-righteous, hypocritical scene. It is obvious that violence can be used accordingly, it is sometimes a necessity, and this particular scene is the most appropriate use of violence imaginable.The majority of the violence one witnesses in film and TV is far removed from reality, people are aware and afraid of the ugly, messy truth of violence, the films that 'Funny Games' tries to chastise serve only as harmless escapism. Haneke seems very pleased with this creation, but he shouldn't be, this rather ambitious film falls flat, achieving in merely riling its audience, not holding a mirror to their faces. Haneke seems to think he has the viewer in a vice-like grip, and he does, but certainly not in the way he thinks he does, which is 'manipulating' and exposing sick little voyeurs. Instead, he keeps the stranglehold on his audience through his skill of building excruciating tension to the point where the eventual violence, which is never gratuitous, is wholly more devastating. It's undeniably powerful, and the acting is unsettlingly excellent; it's a thoroughly unpleasant, tortuous film. However, if you need reminding of the ugly reality of violence, there are many films out there that will deliver without the pretense.www.hawkensian.com",Funny Games
81,IamROCKAS,This movie is disturbing in the best way possible.,10,20 November 2020,"Michael Haneke has surprised me with the outstanding work that is this movie. This is the only movie of his that I have watched so far. Just by reading his biography as a director, I got the impression that he's a true master of his craft and one of the greatest film artists working today and one that challenges his viewers with films that reflect events in realistic, disturbing, and unforgettable ways. Besides Funny Games (1997), he is also known for Hidden (Caché) (2005), The White Ribbon (2009), and Amour (2012). These movies either won an Oscar or were nominated for one and other various awards. I rarely watch a movie based on the Director but based on this movie, I'm willing to give a shot to his other award-winning projects too.The movie is exceptional for the random violence for the sake of it, 4th wall breaks, and disturbing nature with the element of surprise. Funny Games opens with an aerial shot of a car driving through the peaceful countryside, to the tune of Italian classical music. It's a scenic drive, just an innocent family of a husband, his wife, and their child looking forward to a relaxing weekend, which would include golfing, sailing, possibly some barbeque too, but then the opening credits suddenly plunge us into grindcore, performed by Naked City, interrupting our senses with the forewarning that this isn't going to be some happy holiday movie. The shift from classical music to the sound that's inspired by thrash metal and hardcore punk with emphasis on extreme speed also gives us a glimpse of how the tone of the movie can change in a snap of a finger and a calm atmosphere can become a violent tornado. As the family is settled in their house, we get introduced to Peter, and later to Paul too. You get a bad vibe from them almost immediately, just from the way they are dressed up and their awkward demeanor, that just feels sinister under that awkwardness. It doesn't take long for the family dog to get smacked by a golf club and for Paul to give his first unexpected 4th wall break as he just casually looks at the camera and smirks while the lifeless body of the dog just falls out of the car in the background. Haneke directs this piece masterfully, as he doesn't show things explicitly but still gives us a clear image of what happened through the dialogue and other visual pieces. As the family gets taken hostage by the two psychopaths, we're only left wondering how they will get out of this situation... or if they will get out.
It's bone-chilling, as you ponder about what you would do when faced with a similarly hopeless situation centered on yourself, and your family. The psychopaths have a game plan and they aren't shy to not introduce the family to it, even breaking the 4th wall again and asking us, the audience, about what we thinking about the family's chances of surviving until 9 AM of the next day. Between Paul and Peter, I think the former is the more menacing one, despite his cool exterior. Even though all the rules have been cast, we, just like the family, cannot grasp what his intentions and motivations are, why is he actually trying to achieve with this hostage situation. His sidekick, Peter, is loyal, despite his burly exterior giving some hope that he can be manipulated by talking some sense into him.Manipulation seemed to be the aim of the game. This movie contained loads of violence, most of which is off-screen. One of the most shocking scenes simply includes Paul making a sandwich while we only head what's happening in the other room. This scene is brilliant as it is horrific and disturbing in a way that we know what happened without even seeing it happen, not even that sandwich distracted us from the disturbing violent nature of the movie. This leads us to a key scene - a 10-minute single take, which finally showed us the outcome of the mess that happened in the other room. Just seeing the child's body strung out like that and the entire breakdown - the mom sitting in disbelief and her husband breaking down in agony - is gut-wrenching, to say the least. I'm pretty sure most of the viewers, including me, were asking for blood, an eye for an eye, as a ""violence begets violence"" conclusion, and this makes me no different from the duo of psychos, who want to see blood spilled for the simple reason that they can. Actually, we kind of got that as the wife manages to pull a fast one and shoots Peter but Haneke just said ""you want that, don't you? I will deny you that pleasure"" and pulled a fast one on us all. Of course, Paul is a metaphysical character, who knows he exists in the movie while everyone else is oblivious. He simply grabs a remote and rewinds the scene where Peter got killed and continues the agony of the surviving family members. The 4th wall breaks don't end here but this one was probably the most memorable as the movie gives us some closure and then takes it away again.This movie got me feeling messed up. It's crazy how a random family got destroyed just for existing and being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In the end, you know that the family never had a chance too. I only focused on Paul's 4th wall breaks but towards the end, I noticed Peter talking and interacting with the audience, not the family, as if we're at the side, watching the proceeding of the sick games that they play. This movie deliberately manipulates the audience and I love it for that. As 9 AM is closing by, our last victim meets her fate and we stumble onto the next set of victims, just before Paul gives us the final 4th wall break of the movie by staring into the camera, and giving a slight smile, knowing that the cycle is about to continue with a new set of players, just as the frame freezes and the grindcore music blasts again.",Funny Games
82,FrightMeter,Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,1,27 May 2003,"God.  I don't know what to say.  I have heard so many great things about this film, that my expectations were pretty high.  It has such a simple, intense plot that could have been SOOO much better.  As many people have mentioned, there was really no point whatsoever to this movie.  We are basically subjected to two hours of a family being brutalized.  Oh, but that is not the problem-there have been many films with this very plot that have pulled it off extremely well.  Wes Craven's Last House on the Left comes to mind.  The problem with this film is the ridiculous attempt for the filmmaker to make us, the audience, try to be part of the film.  He does this by having the villains look at the camera and ask stupid questions about what we think should happen and occasionally pausing the picture for long (and I do mean LONG) periods of time after something horrible happens. I honestly thought my DVD player was messed up!  The problem with this comes in the fact that this is suppose to be a disturbing movie (and in many respects it is), but at the points in the film when we, the viewer, are totally enthralled, we are reminded that we are watching a movie by the dimwitted villain.  And the remote control/rewind scene was god awful!  I'm sorry, but I wanted the mother to blow away the sleazeball!  We needed some redemption for what these monsters did to that family!  Look, I appreciate filmmakers trying new and inventive things in their films, but they also need to realize that the general public will be watching them.  We don't want to sit at stare at a paused screen for 10 minutes because you think it is effective in illlustrating how horrible something is.  We also don't want to be tricked by a ridiculous remote-control cop out.  I was SO angry at the end of this film and sat and stared at the screen for at least 5 minutes. The film went nowhere and (SPOILER) the fact that the villains kill the entire family and move on to another is totally UNSATISFYING for this picture.  The question very well does become WHAT WAS THE POINT!!  Please, take my advice and avoid at all costs!  1 out of 10!!!!",Funny Games

But this film does not come across as a dark comedy, except for these few annoying spots, which are not funny.

87,willians_franco,Free disturbing violence,8,13 August 2019,"A disturbing film because of the discomfort and tension it creates in the viewer. It leaves a sense of non-conformity, injustice, anguish, and disgust when faced with the unusual behavior of the sadistic executioners in the film. Even after watching it, some reactions will remain in the viewer's thoughts. I believe that this film has a strong impact because it doesn't have a Hollywood style ending, that is, a pretty ending. It is something new, unusual and unpredictable.
Both films, this one from 1997 and the remake from 2007, are very good. In some countries, it has been given the title of ""Free Violence"". And that's exactly what the plot is about: causing tension in the viewer by the psychological drama of gratuitous violence without justification. The author's line of thought is: ""Suffering is even worse when there is no obvious and convincing reason for the process, endlessly prolonging itself without any understanding"".
Congratulations to screenwriter and director Mr. Haneke for this masterpiece of terror. Congratulations also to actress Susanne Lothar for her interpretation. Among the actors, I found her performance to be the best.
I strongly recommend this film to all lovers of cinematographic terror. I also recommend the remake of 2007.",Funny Games
88,malcp,Perhaps the most literal film title I've ever come across,7,7 October 2017,"Having seen several of Haneke's films, I didn't realise that this was a bit of an odd one out. Film is always about the relationship between what a filmmaker is attempting to portray and the films audience. But different people watch different films for different reasons and in some respects, with this film it feels as though Haneke is just being patronising to people who've seen some of his other films. Had it been included as one of the ""Saw"" series, I think I'd have probably rated it higher. Obviously I didn't know where this film was going at the outset, but anyone who's watched some of Haneke's other films, has to recognise that they are rather more ambitious than mere torture-porn. So why take time to belittle your own audience with a film that asks the question ""Why are you watching this film?"". The film works well in exploring and presenting that concept,and is beautifully acted, lighted and shot, but the narrative is all rather showboating for anyone who is watching this film for its critical value. My experience is that the only people who act outside social norms as depicted in this film are either very small children or near-fictional creations of the media used to frame their own agenda. As a viewer of this particular package, I was hoping for something more ambitious from Haneke than a sort of childish game.",Funny Games
89,MWNiese,Breaking the Fourth Wall,8,25 August 2008,"A wealthy family heads to their isolated summer cottage for a family vacation. Shortly after arriving two young men encroach upon the families's idyllic paradise, imposing upon them a nightmarish series of ""Funny Games"". ""Funny Games"" is disturbing first and foremost. There are no cheap scares or over-the-top gratuitous violence. It's a first class terror that uses psychological attacks on the mind to endow the audience with an unforgettable journey into a nightmarish series of terrorizing events.Yes, this film truly is a work of art. The acting, every last actor, is impeccably well cast and turns in an outstanding performance. With the exception of several questionable editing and directing moves, the production aspects of this film are first class. The cinematography is simply beautiful. ""Funny Games"" has such refinement from beginning to end. It really puts shame to most modern American horror productions.The film should have been trimmed down from 1:42:00 to perhaps 1:30:00. The film makers chose to use very long takes in an effort to convey different emotional outpourings. And while these long takes are executed well and convey these feelings, these shots didn't need to be quite so long. There's a fine line between utilizing a longer take to convey emotions and distracting/ boring the audience. Again this film is a masterpiece, but I must disagree with the use of the ""rewind"" scene. Yes, yes the director was trying to make a point about gratuitous real world violence. But I felt the use of the ""rewind"" scene and the direct addressing of moviegoers (Or as defined in theater, breaking the fourth wall) were anti-climatic. Each time one of these techniques were used the tension that had been building was lost. I really don't care if the film maker was trying to make a point, these filming techniques were distracting and unprofessional; they were the reason I gave this film 8 stars instead of 10.Also in question is the decision to film almost all the violent acts off screen. Yes, I understand the film makers were using creative ingenuity to create this work of art, but filming almost every single act of violence and nudity off screen got to be annoying. I felt this decision by the film makers also took away from the terror we could have felt for the well developed characters that made up the vacationing family. What I'm saying is that I finally found a horror film with well developed characters, and the producers choose to exclude from the screen all the violent acts committed against these characters we care so much about. Usually the problem with horror movies is that the characters are underdeveloped and every single act of violence is shown over and over in a close-up. ""Funny Games"" has the opposite problem.Please don't misunderstand me, this film is a treasure. ""Breaking the fourth act"" and using on ""screen rewinds"" are totally open to interpretation, but I'm against them both. Despite the violence being off screen it still manages to be shocking and disturbing. ""Funny Games"" is a unique, genius that should be a pleasure for any educated fan of horror. I haven't seen the US version and will not be planning on viewing it anytime soon. I'm on the verge of giving up completely on horror films released in the US, but that's a different story. I highly recommend this film to seasoned and informed horror veterans across the globe.",Funny Games

I liked how instead of slaughter, we saw anxiety, tears and fear - genuine feelings that would be the focus of situations like this if things were happening in real life. And even though I liked how this movie portrayed the truthfulness of such an event, I think that some moments were pretty monotone which took away that intense feeling a person is supposed to sense in similar movies.

92,tao902,Third rate cinema masquerading as art cinema.,1,14 November 2013,"No doubt Michael Haneke is sincere in his use of film to tell stories but I suspect he is surprised at the critical acclaim he has received as I also suspect he knows that his stories are not particularly clever and his techniques not that original. Funny Games is yet a further example of his style in action. Find a plot with unpleasant themes, throw in some 'alternative' techniques (there's good reasons why such techniques aren't usually used), shock the audience into taking notice (possibly keep them awake) and hope the critics don't notice how empty and mediocre the production actually is. He's fooled people before Funny Games with the phoney mystery in Hidden and fooled people since with the overplayed understatement of Amour. The central themes to Haneke's work are potentially interesting but the ways in which they are dealt with are needlessly complex to the point where they don't provide insights or develop deeper understanding. Well composed shots with interesting Mise-en-scène are not enough to make a film memorable and long takes of little happening end up as distracting rather than revealing. Film critics looking for 'art cinema' upon which to heap praise are fooled into thinking they're dealing with something profound when in truth it's third rate cinema.",Funny Games
93,canadude,"funny oh-oh, not funny ha-ha",1,20 March 2004,"I saw this film to quench the curiosity that has been building for a year or two now. I've read that the film is intense and that it's brutal and controversial and, many argue (and some suggest), important. And apparently no violence is actually seen on screen.Well, the truth is there is violence on screen. People are beaten and shot. But that doesn't bother me. Those who read my other reviews know that I am accustomed to on-screen violence which, as ""Funny Games"" would have me believe, is a serious crime on my part. Maybe the film is right in its moralizing assumptions and claims; I'll touch on that in a second. But before I do - ""Funny Games"" is not a daring film. It is not an interesting or very intense film. It is boring, contrived, empty and useless. It's a flagrant waste of celluloid, its reputation thriving off controversy and the foreign language its in - after all a foreign language film must be artistic and good just because it's different than the Hollywood drivel.
Don't get me wrong. I mean the terms ""Hollywood drivel"" full-heartedly and sincerely. I like originality and daring. ""Funny Games,"" the story of a family of three tortured and killed over a period of a little more than 12 hours by two strangers, for no apparent reason, is a bad, bad film.

But once the killers begin their little murderous spree, ""Funny Games"" loses any momentum. There is no plot, the spectacle so utterly nihilistic and (as I slowly grew aware of it) inane. Yes, there are several extremely heavy-handed narrative tricks where the killer faces the camera and talks directly to the audience about its involvement in the crimes being committed (the words ""subtle"" and ""unforced symbolism"" come to mind). But so what? Just because the killer says we're guilty are we supposed to listen to him? No. ""Funny Games"" attempts to show that by watching violence and enjoying it we come very close to the actual act of killing; or in the very least tries to establish a very close relationship between watching violence and committing it. (As a side-note, it turns out that the more violent societies are ones which don't have TV and the news and brutal films.) Anyway, first off that theme is so old. There must have been a hundred movies made in the nineties and now about media violence and violent society and so on. Think ""Bowling for Columbine,"" or ""Natural Born Killers."" The theme is overdone and in ""Funny Games"" it is handled so awkwardly I wanted to burst out laughing when the killers spoke to the camera. Plus, the more successful treatments of the problem of violence usually had a broader social context. Here, five people interact, some tortured and killed, others torturing and killing. Beyond that there is nothing to ""Funny Games."" It's a dumb show fraught with violence, but hardly about it. It's a movie which could have succeeded on some bare level as a film if the dumb show was at least intense; it's not - it's boring. Do you reflect about anything after watching it? Yes. You wonder how bad the American films must be in order to make critics and serious film-goers write great reviews of a terrible film just because it's not in English. I believe that that's one of the only reasons people think it's good. I mean, imagine this film with an English-speaking cast and believe me - no one would like it.",Funny Games
94,kuciak,A pretentious cinema,6,6 April 2008,"I think the director of this film succeeded in showing the horror of violence, and its real aftermath. This is due I think to the great performances of the main actors in the film. However, I have a huge problem I guess with the film, and the idea of making this American Remake.I saw the film on Independent Film Channel many years ago. However, I can't say I really saw the whole film, especially with the child being pursued in the film. I would turn the channel, and then go back to it. I had seen the ending first. I have however, not seen this film since early 2001, and would not want to see it again.First, it has been mentioned that the film was not a success at the box office when first released in the United States. I would however, even venture to guess, that this film was not a success even in Austria or Germany when first released their. I don't really know if this is the case, however, many Germans, I have been told, when they go to the movies, they would rather go to the American movies.Some 23 years ago, I was talking to a former lawyer for Duetche Gramaphone. Orson Welles had just passed away, and I was quite sad about that. He was critical of Welles, claiming that he made only films for himself and not people, and that was why he was not as successful as he might have been. he was also critical of German directors, saying that they made films for themselves, and not the general public. I always remember Welles saying, ""I'm your humble servant"". Mr. Hanke, to me seems like perhaps like some other European directors, who can make films because they get help from some film funds, try to hard be giving people sermons on what they should think, and perhaps are not able to communicate to the people they really want to communicate to. They only end up having their films seen by what might be regarded as an elitist group, and may only be preaching to the choir. If those people who are interested in what might be described as a sadistic cinema, I sadly think this director might be entertaining them, and might be wetting their appetite for ""more"". Now, and I think rather sadly, because he is considered one of the top European directors, He can come to America, and make an American film, a remake, with well known actors in the Hollywood establishment. I have no problems with film critics who are able to champion films that the general public might not otherwise see, or film festivals that might open our eyes. However, where films that just would be entertainment, have their downsides, people who can get money to make films from sources I suspect that might not be interested in box office, also has its downsides.My next criticism is that in this directors remake, he felt that the original story should really have been an American film, and it is my understanding, that is why this remake is taking place in the United States. This is really a cheap shot. In Germany, in the 1960's, the film adaptations of Edgar Wallace stories were very popular, with murders taking place constantly, and conveniently for the German populace, taking place in England. Later in Italy, Dario Argento, and to some extent Mario Bava, also had the sadistic murder thrillers, also known as the Giallo's. It is interesting that Mr. Hanke ranks PSYCHO, as one of the greatest films ever made. This American film, directed by a great English Director, is the kind of film that Mr. Hanke should really be repulsed by, since it can be argued, that it spawned many of the films that Mr. Hanke seems to despise, and blame. If he is blaming the Americans for our present state, what a hypocrite.Finally I guess Funny Games is some 90 minutes long. I saw the Martin Ritt film that he made with James Gardner and Sally Field's called Murphy's Romance. In one scene, the characters are in a movie theater. I believe they are watching one of the Friday THE 13TH films. During the watching of the film, a blade goes through a woman's stomach, as I recall. Murphy, played by James Garner, walks out of the film. An American man who I watching it with, not only found this scene quite funny, but we understood what the film makers were saying at that moment. They made an entertaining film, and made their point in only one minute, where it to Mr. Hanke some 90 minutes to say the same thing. I also think that those people who enjoyed Friday THE 13'TH movies might also have seen MURPHY's ROMANCE, and might also have been given more food for thought, than Mr. Hanke ever could dream of.",Funny Games
95,KobusAdAstra,"Don't give eggs to strangers, or swallow a brilliant director's bait",9,25 September 2017,"I watched the original 1997 version of 'Funny Games' a few days ago and haven't stopped thinking about it since. The narrative in short: A wealthy Austrian family, dad Georg (Ulrich Mühe) mum Anna (Susanne Lothar) and their young son Schorschi (Stefan Clapczynski), arrives at their holiday home at a picturesque lake. Soon after their arrival a young man knocks on the door, saying that he is staying with mutual friends and that they ask to borrow a few eggs. Anna lets him in; soon his friend joins him. The home invasion starts. Both intruders Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch) initially look open-faced - even their names echo some biblical connotation - but their evil side would soon appear when they psychologically and physically assault the family. The tragedy relentlessly unfolds.I have seen quite a few truly unsettling films (such as Lars von Trier's 'Antichrist') but 'Funny Games' tops the list. The visuals are not that graphic; we are mostly shown post-violence scenes and not the physical attacks actually happening. Director Haneke clearly avoids sensationalism. I found this film extremely hard to watch. Yet, I could not look away, sitting mesmerized in front of the screen. Michael Haneke had me hooked. Afterwards I realized how I was being manipulated. When Anna took the shotgun and shot the chubby intruder, his blood splattering the wall behind him and even the face of his mate, I felt elated. Serves him right, that will show the son of a b! I Only when the narrative was 're-winded', with both antagonists now surviving, did I realize that in my initial reaction I had become not much different from the intruders. A shocking realization.This intelligent and provocative film should be seen by serious movie-lovers. Viewers suffering from psychological stress should be warned that this film may not be for them. I found it profoundly unsettling, but with outstanding cinematographic qualities. 9/10.",Funny Games
96,lumieretrain,Funny Games (1997) by Michael Haneke,4,18 April 2019,"The stories about psychopaths who take innocent people hostage, are recognized to shock the audience. Especially for how these psychopaths would make the victims suffer, in the most painful and unexpected ways to be disturbingly provocative. Most of these stories are recognized for the use of some strong elements like the sadomasochism, which makes these stories disturbing until there would be a shocking conclusion. Some of these stories would end with the victims kill the psychopaths to release their anger, after they have been through the hell mentally and physically. Other stories would end with the psychopaths kill the victims, to start a new nightmare by searching other victims to torture. The auteur filmmaker Michael Haneke has been interested to release a movie, which would use this theme but to give the audience some reflections about the violence. In 1997 came out Funny Games by Michael Haneke with Susanne Lothar, Ulrich Mühe, Arno Frisch, Frank Giering and Stefan Clapczynski. The movie's plot: Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering) are two young violent psychopaths, who take a family, composed of Georg (Ulrich Mühe), Anna (Susanne Lothar) and Georg Jr. (Stefan Clapczynski), hostage in the vacation cabin. These psychopaths would make the family suffer, by playing a sadistic game to have fun. The movie seems interesting to capture the audience attention, instead the movie would actually bore the audience from the beginning to the end. The long mise-en scenés are usually supposed to create sequences that would look like paintings, but most of these sequences are exaggeratedly long to be considered not interesting and boring. Arno Frisch and Frank Giering as the two psychopaths were supposed to give, some scary expressions in the course of the story. But they would actually have the same faces to be not enough expressive, neither if they would act some scary dialogues or even monologues in the course of the movie. One of the few interesting parts of the movie is the specific use of the sounds, which would make the tension grow to scare the audience when something unexpected happen. Even some people would find it pointless, for which would make the rhythm flat in the following clue sequences. Ulrich Mühe, Susanne Lothar and Stefan Clapczynski did acceptable performances as the victims, who would try to survive in all the way from the sadistic game. Even in some parts of the movie the victims would take decisions, to make the audience nervous and make them think the characters are wasting their time rather than take some smart actions. In the course of the movie Paul looks and talks to the camera, to involve the audience which would help to describe how evil are Paul and Peter. It is usually interesting to follow the characters' thoughts, especially from the villains who have the control of these kind of evil plans. Unfortunately some of these sequences in the movie, can be considered forced to make the story not workable and pointless. Funny Games is one of the most important movies, which can be loved or even hated.",Funny Games
97,Semih,Interesting way of Filmmaking,8,3 July 2000,"There is alot about this film that I really enjoyed. The acting was great, and so was the screenplay. The two bad boys play mental games with this poor hostage family and sometimes it can be so disturbing and effective. But this film brought new insights into the art of filmmaking. Two methods I found very interesting: 1) There are a few scenes where nothing is happening and everything is silent. And this lasts for about 5 minutes. It might be shorter but it does start feeling pretty long. Just imagine a room, with a tipped over table lamp and one person lying on the floor, and one person kneeling on the ground. they are doing nothing but just staying there like that. It can be really effective on the audience. Very realistic and almost a break from all the mental and physical violence that we see early on in the film. But silence that long with no movement or dialogue is very unusual, but there actually is alot going on in that scene. I felt I was forced to put myself in their place and try to imagine what it was like. 2) The two bad boys now and then look back at the camera and ask the audience some questions or simply comment. That puts us into the picture but then it also makes us realise that this is a movie after all. But then it gets us confused and the line between violence on screen and violence in reality becomes very thin. Great film, very unique approach.",Funny Games
98,khemass,"Very, very disturbing movie",9,16 August 2007,"I watched this movie many years ago and I still can't forget it. This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It makes the viewers experience 'reality' of what is like to be captured by cold-blooded killers. This is not Hollywood. No hero saving you at the last minute. This is so real, so chilling. You can't expect how the plot will turn out at all. In some scenes, the camera holds still for a long time but, oh hell, it is so effective! I understand why they put the words 'See it if you dare'. For me, I really want to warn people who cannot take much disturbing movie to stay away from this one. This movie is well-made and original, BUT...it will leave you paranoid and scared for a long time. No,they don't use anything gruesome or any ugly pictures of corpse and blood, but they let you experience real crime,all of its terror, like you're sitting in it. It's an art, yes, but I'm not sure if it's good for everyone. If you're already paranoid about being captured by psycho killer or having bad people break through your house, then don't watch it. You'll suffer from it a long time. But for those who love horror films, well this is your treat.",Funny Games
99,Stephen-12,Sickeningly brilliant,9,16 November 1998,"One can imagine the thoughts in Michael Haneke's head: ""So, you like violence, do you? You laughed when the guy's head got blown off in 'Pulp Fiction'? You enjoy a good gunfight in a Western? You think Stallone destroying the Viet Cong is a great night out? Well, I'm going to show you what violence is REALLY like. And, what's more, it's exactly the kind of thing that could happen to you in your home.""One of the most terrifying films ever made. Leaving aside the fact that the two young men are obvious psychopaths, this drama has incredible plausibility. Watching the film left me quite shaken. It's clear that Haneke has several motives in mind: showing the vividness and awfulness of real violence; challenging the smugness of the viewer, who believes he is not implicit because he is separated from the action by the screen; and defying movie cliches by immediately reversing any gains which the 'goodies' manage. That you want to get up at the end and shout ""bastards!"" at the screen is entirely the point.A courageous film, with good use of music, persuasive acting and a gut-gripping denouement. The kind of film that makes you want to go and become a policeman.9 out of 10. I knock off one point only because I wouldn't want to sit through it twice.",Funny Games
100,claudemercure,a great thriller... as long as you ignore the director's pretensions,7,15 March 2009,"In this cross between Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf and A Clockwork Orange, two insolent young psychopaths torment a vacationing family.It was hard to organize my thoughts on this movie, never mind rating it. As a thriller, this is a tense, well-acted, and relentless experience, marred only by a contrived sequence two-thirds through in which characters behave in unbelievably stupid fashion. However, said sequence is preceded by an incredibly effective ten-minute take. Unusually lengthy takes are often deemed self-indulgent, but this one is anything but.As an ideological statement, though, this film is a failure. And there is no doubt that writer-director Michael Haneke is trying to make a statement. By having one of the psychos address the camera a few times, saying things to the effect that they have to give the viewers their money's worth, Haneke is essentially wagging his finger at anyone who has ever enjoyed the portrayal of violence in a film. This theme is certainly open to debate, but the problem is that Haneke expresses it in such a condescending way. His harrowing treatment of violence already serves as an excellent counterpoint to other films that glamorize it. There was no need to then leave viewers feeling as though they'd just been lectured by a stern parent.The last time a filmmaker made me angry, it was when I saw Independence Day, and it was for the same reason. In both cases, the writer and the director display contempt by assuming their audiences are idiots. My anger didn't really ignite, though, until I watched a short interview with Haneke on the DVD. It made me never want to see another one of his films. The man is disgustingly full of himself.So why the relatively high rating? Because as pretentious and self-important as Haneke is, he is also very talented. The movie is very effective on an emotional level, and it's possible to watch it while ignoring the director's wrong-headed decisions.",Funny Games
101,afrodome,A Brutal Lesson On What Violence Really Is,10,13 July 2017,"Funny Games is a unique beast. I cannot think of a movie that can be compared to it's gut- punching themes; the best I can do is compare it to the Blue Eye Brown Eye Experiment conducted by Jane Elliot. If you don't know what this is, it's a social experiment that involves the separating of a group into 2 segments: blue eyed people and brown eyed people. Jane has the blue eyed group exit the classroom and then instructs the remaining brown eyed group that they supersede the blue eyed group in terms of look, intelligence, worth etc. This experiment, at times being praised as daring yet necessary, put many people in tears throughout the 40-some odd years that Jane has been conducting it. Outrage, trauma, people exclaiming ""I'm not racist and I have never treated anyone like this"" infuriated at Jane. The experiment's core purpose was to untangle the socialized racism that so many people have been complacently conditioned to appropriating. Funny Games works in the same fashion: you are not in control and the antagonists make that quite clear from the time the begin tormenting the family on screen. Unlike vacuously violent and hollow films of recent years such as Martyrs & Eden Lake; which themes rely on sadism, hopelessness and doubt, Funny Games shakes it's finger at you and reminds you that what you are seeing in front of you is the same thing that you go to for entertainment: violence.. the only difference is that you don't get to casually ""hurraw"" to your TV screen while you watch masked vigilantes beating the drug dealer with a brick to the sound of Led Zeppelin; instead, you get cunning, callous silence with the haunting echos of whimpering while Peter and Paul stay consistently composed which for whatever reason makes each minute more agonizing than the last. Is it pleasant? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Hell no. Does it serve it's purpose? Absolutely. This is a film I could not bring myself to watching. With that sad, I was devastated after watching it; but it was devastation myself rather than what I had seen. I reflected on all the times I watched violent television/movies and treated it as if it was just a part of the entertainment turnstile; I need my fill of violence to enjoy something. After Funny Games, I steered my direction toward movies that will not make light of the seriousness that violence can bring. Even films like 21 Jump Street give me that 'what am I doing?' feeling. This film is punch in the face followed by being sent to the confinement chair of shame. It will probably change you, but in way that you will feel thankful for further down the road.",Funny Games
102,montferrato,Artsy and Preachy Torture Porn,7,18 February 2021,"You all know the story. Two young guys get away with a home invasion and they torture and murder everybody in the family, dog and son included.
The cool thing about the movie is that the story transgress on purpose all the cinematic conventions. This means that the killers have a terrific time, enjoy the bloodlust fest and carry on with the rampage without being caught.
Apparently, the purpose of the movie was to expose the sickness of violence, blah, blah, blah.
Well, this is just a lame excuse to make a picture that every psychopath out there will love.
I give it a good rating because of three uncommon facts in this type of movie:
1. All the actors were very good, realistic, and gave extremely good performances.
2. The violence is extremely intense, of the emotional type, amplified tenfold by the masterful restriction of explicit scenes.
3. The movie plot breaks on purpose with all cinematic conventions of this genre.
The downside is the preachy tone of the movie. It is highly hypocritical. In the end, the movie is high quality torture porn, very sophisticated.
Also, i did not like the metacinematic things: one of the actors talks to the audience, looking at the camera, trying to involve the observer. I am not a fan of this type of thing.
My advice is that you should watch the movie, unless you're disgusted by stories that do not have morals and are completely nihilistic. My gut feeling is that the director enjoyed himself very much.",Funny Games

There is a scene where one of the interlopers searches desperately for a television remote control device so that he can turn back time. Is this to tell us, the viewer, that the ongoing is all fiction, which we know damn well it is. But then, if it is, why does the unreality of whats happening seem so real...or surreal?

105,stewiefan201,"Funny Games is a creepy and sickening horror film, although it turns out to be more of an endurance test by the end.",8,17 March 2008,"Funny Games is the 1997 German horror film written and directed by the talented Michael Haneke. It is about a wife and husband named Anna (Susanne Lothar) and Georg (Ulrich Muhe), and their son Georgie. They drive down to their luxurious vacation home by the water. They're all set to put the boat in the water, and start their dream vacation when two young men knock on the door. The two young, and strangely polite and illiterate, guys are named Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering), and after just a few minutes Anna is beginning to get uncomfortable. They start making excuses and refuse to leave until Paul finally takes a golf club and injure Georg's leg. From there on in the two guys make a bet that the family will not be alive by 9:00 the next morning. And until that time they play torturous and mind bending psychotic games with the family until they almost completely lose their wits.This is quite a hard film to review since for a while I just had no clue what to write about. But now that I've had two days to think about it a little, I have a few comments. Let me start off by saying that Funny Games is an extremely disturbing film. I read up on it before I watched it and knew to expect the violence, but nothing prepared me for the shocking nature of the movie. Most of the violence occurs off screen or is implied but blurred out in the corner of the screen. Very much of the violent acts, save for the golf club scene, are all psychological and require the viewer to imagine the pain and terrifying misery this family must be feeling. This makes Funny Games all the more potent but definitely not for everyone. I am sure many people walked out of the theater or turned it off when watching it. Some viewers either didn't know what Funny Games was about before-hand or their expectations for the violence was completely disoriented.The acting is very strong from all the actors. Ulrich Muhe is excellent as the concerned father who in the end just fails to do anything to stop the situation. Susanne Lothar is also excellent, and I'd like to congratulate the make up department because they made her look like a woman that has just been dragged through the burning embers of hell. Arno Frisch and Frank Giering play their parts to the T. Although Frisch makes his character Paul creepier and more psychotic-seeming than Peter. However Peter does turn out more insecure than Paul. Other than these four, plus the boy playing the son, there are not many other actors throughout the movie. So essentially these actors have to carry everything on their own shoulders, and they do quite a fine job.Michael Haneke said in interviews that what he was trying to do with Funny Games was toy with the audience, and make them feel guilty for enjoying violence in the media and especially movies. Though not so much back in the 1990s, and more in the 2000s, people seemed to enjoy and crave gory torturous films. Funny Games was remade in 2008 in English not only to widen its audience, but also because it fits more with the new generation. This original version of Funny Games was not quite as fitting as it would be today. But if it was punishing the torture craving audiences Haneke wanted, he sure did it quite well. There are a couple of scenes in the movie when the lead villain Paul acknowledges the audience, and either gives them a leering grin or actually talks to them and/or asks them a question. This is where Haneke goes too far. We get his point clearly so he really doesn't need to go all ""Ferris Bueller"" on us. The one thing you should probably never do in a film is have a character verbally interact with the viewer. It works in some films usually for comic relief, but for Funny Games it detracts from the emotional response to the film, and is just not necessary. However all in all peoples' thirst for violence is a controversial topic, and I'm glad at least one director out there is addressing it. Some did not like this movie because it doesn't follow horror movie clichés and what you expect to happen backfires on you. Almost everything you expect is demolished in Funny Games, so expect the unexpected.Funny Games may be sickening and torturous to its violence-hungry audience, but it is an experience. While many people were just plain out disturbed by this movie, I was disturbed in a different way. I've seen what the new generation's torture porn genre has to offer. So the film did not really make me cringe or send shivers down my spine, I was more disgusted and hateful to the two villains. However therein lies the point of Funny Games, it is more of an endurance test by the end. If you're enjoying the torture going on, then this is a learning experience for you. If you are repulsed by it then you're pretty much human. I give Funny Games a 3 out of 4. For some strange reason I still want to see the remake.",Funny Games

That is all it is about.Now, a lot of pretentious, obvious smut peddling has gone on over this film. Over and over again you will hear how it is a ""scream of anger directed at the viewer"" and garbage like that, as if the film's creator is really some kind of peace loving, soulful artist who just wants people to think. I call bullsh*t on that, for the following reasons.1. The kind of viewer who actually has sadistic reasons for watching violence in films to some problematic degree is not going to be affected by this kind of thing...they are going to BUY it, and they are going to LOVE it. The director, with all his ""angry screaming"", did nothing more than make them some more porn. We are talking about the ""Faces of Death"" crowd. This is a very small, private minority. The majority of filmgoers do not need or deserve this lesson.2. When people complain about violent movies, the typical scenario they are talking about is a good guy who must take on powerful bad guys, and gets his ass kicked most of the time as he kicks the bad guy's asses back. I don't know anyone who likes watching children tortured, terrorized, and killed on film. So who is the FUNNY GAMES lesson for? People who already don't like to see it? They will not like to see it here, and that is no surprise. People who DO want to see that happen? Well, they will be delighted. There are very few movies that feature anything like this, and the idiot who made this movie gave those perverts a big present, wrapped in a shiny bow.3. People tend to do what they want to do. So, if a filmmaker makes a horrible, sad, offensive, obscene movie and then turns around and acts like he felt forced to make it to teach someone a lesson, he is full of sh*t. He isn't trying to teach a lesson, he is trying to bring his sick fantasies to life, like any pornographer. The fact that he can claim to hold some moral high ground as he hands the viewers a plate full of sh*t, and makes impressionable people think they should feel at fault for what he himself did is just a joke he is playing on the viewership. He is laughing his ass off at how he made a something horrible and perverted for his own kicks and thrills and got you to call it art.The bottom line is, you can't fight violence in films by making one more violent film. And the director knows that. It was never really his goal anyway.I put this same comment on the page for the American remake.",Funny Games

Brilliant direction gives this the spin Natural Born Killers aimed for and missed. That is the implication of the audience in media violence.  Here the film doesn't pretend to be above and beyond it's own allegory, but it suprisingly does this while showing little on screen violence.The theoretical stuff aside, it's one hell of a suspenseful thriller. An excellent ensemble cast and uncomfortably perfect timing make the confrontations eerily believable.  The husband and wife who are no experts at being victims, lead fairly bland lives.  It's illustrated cleverly.  At one point during their abduction and torture, the perpetrators leave.  Free to escape or do what they will, they fumble about the house, blow drying the cell phone, bandaging wounds, taking their time before going for help, and basically sit around being as boring as hell.The hoodlums return for one last round, crushing all expectations of a bittersweet ending.  Throughout the film, the main vandal turns to the camera and winks or invites us to share the joke with him.  At one point, after the wife shoots one of them, he grabs a remote control and rewinds the scene, changing the outcome.

Funny Games, however, is my choice for most controversial film of the decade, and possibly the most controversial film of all time.The above is a strong statement but anyone who has watched this film will appreciate where it is coming from. The plot is simple enough: a family is taking a holiday on the coast. Barely after arriving in their lodgings, they find themselves intruded upon by two young males. They appear to be polite enough at first, if a little strange, but very quickly their demeanour becomes menacing; this menace is then followed with violence. The victimised couple at first attempt to assert themselves; when that doesn't work, they attempt to bargain. When that fails, they become involved in a tense war of attrition with their very survival at stake. But each attempt to fight against the inevitable only leads to further pain and suffering. It becomes chillingly clear that the situation is unlikely to end well for this family and that their torture will be transmitted as undiluted as possible to the audience bearing its witness. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? Of course this film was always intended to be anything but.In order to fully appreciate this film, you have to appreciate art's ability to generate strong emotions, whether those be positive or negative. Funny Games, of course, operates very much on the negative side of that spectrum: it generates revulsion, horror, disbelief, confusion, anger, resentment, hatred, I could go on. It is very easy to turn those negative emotions towards the film itself and claim it to be an act of cinematic vandalism, but that would be a disingenuous response, in my view. The film does not generate these emotions gratuitously, it is designed to shine an intense light on the mindless violence and gore that often dominates popular cinema. Haneke creates real flesh and blood characters that we can relate to, whom we care about and he makes them suffer so that we will suffer with them. If the experience of watching this film is horrific (and it should be) it is because we as an audience have empathy. This film reminds us of that, and, in this way, it makes us reconsider our relationship with cinema itself.Haneke believes, and I agree, that what we watch on the screen matters, and, whether it is consciously acknowledged or not, that the messages film-makers convey have meaning. He also knows that, in art, you achieve far more in the showing than in the telling. In this film we are shown a vision of pure nihilism and it is as stark and ugly as one can possibly imagine. Haneke is willing to make possibly the most disturbing film committed to celluloid in order to get us to turn away from our worshiping of gratuitous violence altogether and to seek something more enriching and more likely to generate empathy. In this effort, he makes a brutal, post-modern classic.",Funny Games
111,supernma,A different kind of horror,9,21 June 2010,"Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" is more disturbing, horrifying, haunting, and ultimately thought-provoking than anything churned out by the Hollywood mainstream horror industry today.The film is brilliantly photographed and acted, with long static shots that build unbearable amounts of tension, forcing the viewer to watch the terror unfold and daring you to look away. Another interesting tool Haneke employs here is the breaking of the ""fourth wall."" The villains occasionally smirk or wink at directly at the camera or reference the film and audience in character. A very unusual and yet disturbing tactic.As for the message of the film, it's obvious: violence is not entertainment, but something to be loathed and condemned. Some may argue that by conveying this message through the depiction of violence is hypocritical or oxymoronic, but I disagree. The villains (and the filmmakers) constantly taunt and tease the viewer and our protagonists, asking us if we're entertained, if the film is long enough. Haneke is trying to make the point that while we sometimes watch a violent film for entertainment, we forget how horrific and revolting it really can be. Therefore, ""Funny Games"" is a difficult film to categorize. I suppose, at face value, it is a horror film (albiet a ""thinking-man's"" horror film), but is also a social satire with a clear message and theme. It's truly unique and shockingly bold (although I predict many may disagree).",Funny Games

I almost fell asleep during it, and my friend who I saw it with DID fall asleep. And the so-called amazing 4th wall break with the TV was absolutely stupid in my opinion and ruined even the smallest amount of entertainment this movie provided.

The plot was extremely simple...The story telling was pretty plain...But the excitement value was pretty terrifying.Not entertaining in any stretch of imagination but still a movie which definitely cannot be watched by all the people.The movie should have actually made it to a bigger audience but some how wasn't successful enough in doing it.The acting was uniformly good by all the actors and scenes where one of the strangers turns towards the camera and asks the viewers question was pretty innovative.These are the movies which leave people feeling comfortable even after you have finished watching the movie. Plot is pretty simple about a family coming to their summer home are taken hostage and are forced to play funny games with deadly consequences. A good movie (only to people who love this genre) and deserves a 8/10 in my book ....,Funny Games
114,Art Snob,The cure for being too enamored of movie violence!,9,10 June 2002,"I never realized the extent to which big-budget American action films condition audiences into savoring and craving `justifiable' acts of violence until I saw this fascinating and deeply disturbing Austrian movie from noted German director Michael Haneke.  I couldn't sleep after seeing it, but after about a week had passed, I was very glad that I'd seen it.  I'm now `immune' from being manipulated into enjoying onscreen violence, because the movie made me keenly aware of when I AM being manipulated  and of the `commandments' that movies featuring cathartically satisfying acts of vengeance are built upon and dare not violate.The storyline is sort of a hybrid of THE DESPERATE HOURS and CAPE FEAR, with two very Aryan-looking young men invading the summer cottage of an upper-middle-class family of three and sadistically playing `funny games' with them.  But there's much more than the surface story at work here  Haneke has some clever tricks up his sleeve when it comes to exercising his total control over the `rules' that the movie plays by.  He keeps the audience off-balance by repeatedly violating movie conventions and confounding conditioned expectations as to how events will unfold.Amazingly, there's only ONE act of on-screen violence in the entire movie  and it's a classic example of the 100% acceptable,  `justifiable' sort that American audiences so crave and Hollywood so obligingly provides on a regular basis.  But just as your `rush' kicks in, Haneke pulls the carpet out from underneath you with one of his sleight-of-hand tricks, flip-flopping your pleasure into an equivalent amount of pain.  And as for the RESULTS of the OFF-screen violence  well, you're on your own.Special kudos should go out to actors Arno Frisch and Frank Giering, for being willing to play what must be the creepiest, most contemptible crime duo in movie history.  (The hillbillies in DELIVERANCE have NOTHING on them!)  It takes fearlessness to make yourself a target for audience detestation at this level, and the film wouldn't work if the roles hadn't been so capably filled.Know going in that the `See it if you dare' challenge on the DVD cover is not to be taken lightly.  But know also that if you DO take the challenge, you'll emerge from the experience shaken but wiser  in possession of a whole new perspective on the bogusness of traditional Hollywood crowd-pleasing violence.",Funny Games
115,David_Niemann,"Far from funny, but very good...",8,11 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Anna, Georg and their son are going on holidays. They will be spending a few weeks in a beautiful house near a beautiful lake. Not long after arriving at their destination a young man knocks at the door. He asks Anna if she can spare four eggs, a request he is fulfilling for friends of Anna and Georg's. After Anna gives the young man the eggs he leaves the house, dropping them on the way. Anna then gives him four more eggs, this time wrapping them up in paper, and he leaves. Then a different young man, more older, is at the door with the young man Anna gave the eggs to. It seems as if Anna and Georg's dog has jumped on the young man, breaking the eggs. And now they would like four more. Then things start to go bad... Taking the family hostage, the two young men begin a series of games, 'funny games' if you will. Although there is nothing funny about the games they play. I enjoyed ""Funny Games"" quite a lot. There were many moments where I was on the edge of my seat, although I feel the movie is not trying to be an everyday thriller. It is trying to convey a message about violence in movies, and I feel it worked somewhat well.*** SPOILER ALERT *** A lot of people are shocked by the violence in the film. But why? It's only a movie, right? Maybe that was what the director was trying to say. A few times Paul (the older young man) interacts with the audience, he winks at us, looks at us and talks to us. And then there is the ""remote control"" scene. It was always a movie but the movie is telling us it is a movie we are watching. They are actors, it is scripted, it is all fake. Paul even makes a joke about the length of feature films. Yet people get upset when faced with the violence in the film. But wait a second! There is hardly any on-screen violence at all. Maybe what the film's message is that it hardly shows any of the actual violence, but we know it's going on, and our imagination takes over. We imagine the horror. But a lot of people have never experienced anything like what is in the film. Well not in real life... but in the movies is a different story. *** END OF SPOILER ***I liked the credit sequence at the start. I wonder whether it was intentional or not to have the credits fit almost perfectly around the families faces. Whether or not a message about violence in movie's is understood by the viewer won't ruin the film if the viewer is expecting 'just' a thriller. And although the family don't have much depth to them I still found myself caring for their outcome, or at least being disturbed by the idea what if I was in their place. Towards the end there are some dull bits that drag on too long, but on the whole I really enjoyed this film. A lot of people will be confronted by the violence, but if you feel you are up to it I highly recommend it. 8/10",Funny Games

The film left me feeling disgusting and badly shaken, at the story itself, at the fact that I had sat there and watched the whole damn thing, at how real the suffering was. It's like how people slow down to look at a car crash, but it's not just a bit of blood, it's two whole hours.One of the most effective parts of the film to me was how Paul (the ""leader"" of the pack) continued to manipulate and psychologically ""corner"" all the characters, constantly making it sound like his actions were perfectly reasonable, and the victims were the ones at fault.The most ineffective part in my opinion was the Paul's interaction with the audience. Quite frankly, it just seemed silly, and the film would have managed to get its point across without that. It reminded me that it was just a film, and was the only way I could detach from it.But for what it is, it is outstanding film. It takes a very important place in the history of cinema violence.",Funny Games
117,rivera66_99,Almost unbearable...,8,17 May 2001,"... but unbearable just in the sense that violence is. I agree completely with the Swedish commenter who recommended this movie for school classes. The strength of FUNNY GAMES' style is that the perspective of the victims is 100% realistic and that of the killers is 100% alienated (almost absent); so we find ourselves exposed to the occurings in the way victims are, not enabled to ""enjoy"" as we are supposed to be in Tarantino&Co. Regarding the critical content, we should think carefully about ridiculous statements as ""The world is actually so peaceful as it never was"", expressed by some users in this database.",Funny Games
118,Latheman-9,So these two sociopaths walk into a bar ...,5,14 August 2003,"Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" is a film of promise that ultimately fails to deliver, both on the level of social commentary and purely as film. An exercise in cinematic agitprop, it is meant to make clear that the willful viewing of modern violent films is an act of voyeurism bordering on the obscene. But by the same logic then, so is the act of reading. Scenes of horrific cruelty and violence have been portrayed in literature for thousands of years and across many cultures prior to the invention of the motion picture camera. Is Haneke also saying that one should not read the works of Homer, Sophocles, or Shakespeare; or just the softcover pulp sold in porn shops? Like that of most other social realists, Haneke's approach is as subtle as a train wreck to ensure that even the slack-jawed dullards among us won't fail to get the point. While much more common among European 'auteurs', this form of finger-wagging didacticism that sends award juries at Cannes into rhapsody is not unique to the region between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ural Mountains. After all, America has Oliver Stone, for better or worse.In common with many other viewers, I found this film difficult to watch, but for very different reasons. The acting varies from adequate to excellent, depending on the scene. And while moderately well-directed, the story is very poorly written. The film abounds with plot holes, loose strings, poor pacing, and highly unrealistic character reactions. In an early scene, Fred the neighbor comes over with Paul to help Georg the Elder put his boat in the lake. During this sequence, the camera moves in on a shot of a knife being knocked onto the deck. Why? This particular knife plays no further role in the film, so what's the point? Is Haneke perhaps making an allusion to Roman Polanski's ""Knife in the Water"" (1963)? The next scene is the egg debacle between Anna and Peter, after which Paul makes another entrance, and subsequently Georg the Elder appears. But where's good neighbor Fred? We don't know; he's just gone. Or has there been a significant passage of time between the boat and the egg scenes? Is it the next day? We are not given any indication. When Georg the Younger makes his escape, he is unable to get over the fence around the house, having a vertical leap of only three inches, if even that. Speaking from personal experience, I can assure you that even a child is capable of extraordinary feats of athleticism if there is enough adrenalin pumping through his veins. Following the boy's death and the departure of Peter and Paul, Georg the Elder, handicapped by and in excruciating pain with his broken leg, is helped by Anna as they slooooowly make their way across the short distance between the couch and the stairs. It takes several minutes. Why must Georg get downstairs? Wouldn't most men shout at their wives to get out while they could and get help? It's not as if he doesn't know he's unambulatory. But later, during Anna's absence, Georg is miraculously able to get back *up* the stairs unaided to drape a sheet over his son's corpse. Perhaps he took some aspirin in the interim. Meanwhile, Anna is outside the fence of a neighbor's house, screaming for help to no avail. But the bars of the fence are spaced widely enough so that she could shimmy between them and go up to the house and bang on the door (remember: ""no flab""). Does she do so? Not in Haneke's world. There were times when I groaned out loud while watching this mess of a script. As for the antagonists, well a pair of smirking, post-adolescent boys in short shorts and white gloves, each as physically threatening as a bowl of pudding, is just not convincing. This pair brings to mind the adage that one cannot be a victim unless one is willing to be victimized. For a far more memorable portrayal of human depravity, I recommend viewers watch Dennis Hopper's performance in ""Paris Trout"" (1991).It's one thing for Haneke to lecture his audience, but to do so in such an unoriginal manner detracts from the validity of his message, making it almost risible. Much like his later ""The Piano Teacher"" (2001), ""Funny Games"" is a highly derivative film; there is nothing new here: a child's bloody corpse is shown on screen -- Sam Peckinpah's ""Major Dundee"" (1965). Violence and its effects are not realistically portrayed, here's what it's really like! -- done, again by ""Bloody"" Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch"" 1969). This was also the entire point of the extended fight scene in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Torn Curtain"" (1966). People behave irrationally when under duress -- the underlying premise of the Coens' ""Blood Simple"" (1984). The homicidal criminals among us are otherwise very ordinary people -- John McNaughton's truly chilling masterwork ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" (1986). Worst of all, Haneke does not have the excuse of callow youth. He's old enough to be aware of the work of other film makers, and unless he's spent most of his life in some secluded hamlet in the Tyrolean Alps, there's no reason why he couldn't do his homework better.Between Haneke's heavy-handed hectoring and the numerous flaws in the script, I am tempted to give ""Funny Games"" a low rating, but will give it a middling one instead. As clumsy as he is about it, I do believe Haneke has something to say and his effort is an honest one. It could be much worse. It could be a film by Lars Von Trier. Rating: 5/10.",Funny Games
119,sunheadbowed,Funny Games,8,14 April 2018,"'It turns out one universe is real, the other fiction.'
'How come?'
'I don't know.''Funny Games' is an unflinching and fearless study on morality that manages to be both terrifying and funny, it's certainly a film that would be misunderstood by many.The film is a deliberately jarring juxtaposition of both exploitative unrealism and the depressingly realistic within the spectrum of cinema violence. The antagonists are known to us by comical nicknames, such as 'Fatty' or 'Beavis and Butthead' and 'Tom and Jerry' (the latter a deliberate reference to 'acceptable' screen violence for children we take for granted), they constantly make jokes and speak directly to the camera that they perform for, having learned how to behave in this situation from watching violent films, yet we are never allowed to relate to them or their sense of humour, or feel any sympathy for what they are doing, they are completely unjustified at all times; the victims of 'Funny Games' on the other hand are presented horrifically real -- it's likely this is how people would react in the real world when thrown into this nightmare situation, and they are unaware that they are starring in a movie (the late Susanne Lothar's performance in particular is unforgettable). This seesaw of the silly cartoon and the gut-wrenchingly real is uncomfortable to the extreme.This is a film about film violence, it is not a 'violent film'. All acts of violence happen off-screen, we are never permitted to partake in any explicit titillation or enjoyment of witnessing violent acts. The one important exception to this rule is when Anna grabs a shotgun from her captors and blows Fatty's guts out against the wall. We are punished immediately for how much we enjoy this act of revenge by the other antagonist, played by Arno Frisch, grabbing the remote, rewinding the film and resetting us right back to where we were before the act happened. It's an absurdly clever and intellectual moment but it's one that will disgust anyone coming to this film from the wrong angle.Likewise, at one point Anna is forced to strip naked by her captors, which happens off-screen, only a close-up of her face with its etched shock and despair is shown to us and we are not allowed to partake in this act of sexual violence; yet later, when alone with her husband she voluntarily takes off her top displaying her breasts to the viewer. The message is clear: nudity is not immoral, but violence and rape is, even if you're merely a voyeur.There is some powerful symbolic imagery in 'Funny Games', too, such as when Fatty accidentally drops and smashes three eggs -- one for each kidnapped family member, and the sight of the knife on the boat, which is psychologically introduced to us at the beginning of the film as a symbol of hope, only to be flippantly tossed into the water at the close.Ultimately, it's difficult to understand what exact message the film is giving to us: is cinema's exploitation of violence a force for evil in the world? Depictions of violence per se are not dangerous, but how violence is presented, how we view that violence and what we feel about bloody revenge are most certainly dangerous grey areas that we must always talk about. Thankfully there are some filmmakers such as Michael Haneke who are brave and moral enough to confront us with the questions we need to be asked.",Funny Games

Family of three on vacation are taken hostage by two psychotic men who make a bet with the family on their survival. The two performances by the guys are amazing and scary. They nail the sadistic, emotionless killers perfectly. This film is really slow most of the time, but never too dull. Also, while the film is in itself pretty violent, most of the violence is off screen or just moderate. However, this film is still depressing and intense and scary. It is not for everyone.

122,Bloomer,"Nasty puritanical film, disguised as being Progressive",1,4 October 1999,"I saw this excruciatingly didactic flick at the 1998 Sydney Film Festival, and to say it made me mad is the understatement of the century! I would hardly describe it as a thriller or horror film, since these are the genres it seeks to deride; it's more a puritanical lecture than anything else.What's going on in 'Funny Games'? Rich family goes to holiday house. Rich family is imprisoned, beaten, tortured and then some by contrived baddies devoid of any motive. These things are depicted graphically and usually in whatever is the most visceral fashion that the director feels he can get them across, with a particular emphasis on the lack of motive or happy closures, or any kind of relief for the audience. Now, toss in Postmodern self-referential stuff like having the killers wink at the camera (at US!!! OH MY GOD!!!) and talking about the audience getting enough entertainment - eg 'we'll keep beating em up cos there hasn't been a feature film's worth of violence yet' - blah blah blah, to say that we, all of the audience, are complicit in this violence, and you have a conservative faux-intellectual's fantasy.The drawn out articulation of Funny Games' ideas is so blatant and methodological, that all I feel is this film's contempt for myself, and any other viewer who doesn't buy said ideas. And heck, probably just for the average cinemagoer who might see films to experience all kinds of feelings! It's getting up on a soapbox to attack what it would like to think of as gratuitously violent exploitation films, yet is itself an exploitation film in the worst sense. This film would have you believe that so-called 'motiveless' killings really are 100 percent motiveless. And if it's so progressive, why does it associate classical music exclusively with the family and extreme heavy metal with the bad guys? At every level, Funny Games likes to set up what it sees as high culture versus low culture in general (classical versus rock being just one instance) then says that all this low culture is junk culture and tied in with all this excessive violence that the film wants us to question in the cinema. Totally regressive!It is probably also a film that's both hypocritical and preaching to the converted at once. As mentioned at the start, I saw this at the 1998 Sydney Film festival. Now, I know a lot of the people there wouldn't give a horror film, for instance, the time of day, believing that the genre was inherently inferior. Yet these same people were content to watch the didactic sadism of Funny Games, knowing that it's directed by an intellectual Austrian and will pat them on the back in the end and reinforce their viewpoint, which is that horror/violence in cinema is trash. I love horror films, and I think there's infinitely more humanism in feeling the fears they can elicit, in confronting your mortality, and in their sincerity and imagination, than in the one-note lecture and violence of 'Funny Games'.I gave Funny Games my BLACK HOLE award for the film at that festival which SUCKED the most!!",Funny Games
123,meganmarie-19902,Far From A Funny Game,10,16 November 2018,"Haneke delivers us this deeply disturbing psychological thriller that is not as funny as the title states. It will have you questioning does the audience really have a thirst for mindless violence? A middle-class Austrian family consisting of Georg, Anna and their young son Georg Jr, go to their holiday home for a vacation. When settled, their neighbor introduces them to teenage friends Peter and Paul. At first, the boys come across as pretentious, middle class and overbearing of the social norms, but they turned into sadists by the flick of a switch. Assaulting, taking hostage and playing sadistic games began to escalate to the point of horrifying and the natural performances made this film look so realistic it could literally happen at any time anywhere.
Unlike most Hollywood home invasion movies there was little glamour, little gore, and basic camera work, but yet it gives you the most uncomfortable feeling. When Peter and Paul address the audience on what should happen, it breaks the boundaries between on-screen characters and the audience, making us somewhat a part of the pointless torture. The naturalism in this film is often quiet in the horror industry, but yet has more of an impact than the torture porn films out today. The random winks at the camera and long shots of silence make us question why we find sadistic films entertaining.",Funny Games
124,Sally_Kirkland,An annoying yawn,2,15 April 2002,"One have to admit: The plot of ""Funny Games"" is rather intriguing. Two teenagers take a family hostages and tortures them most delicately. Interesting and strange idea - and does it work?This film has a lot of buzz going around for it. It is 'art', 'shocking' and 'provocative'. But in fact - it is none of these. The shock is never there as the production company clearly haven't had the money to show us the actual physical torture. Instead we hear the noises and see the poor victims afterwards. And it never really surprises us as the eleged evil spirit of the youngsters clearly is being established at the beginning of the film. As for the physical tortures the structure of the family is so badly drawn that it doesn't show us anything but a marriage that never worked in the first place as it never consisted of real people. And that actually does make the tormenting rather tedious.The provocative elements are almost laughable. Of course we have to be terrified with these actions taken by regular young boys, but it never works. And it's even quite embarrasing as Michael Haneke tries to add a patina of existentialistic questions to this absolute nonsense. It is extremely annoying and clearly shows the director's intentions with this film - some intentions that never are fullfilled as the director himself is so focused on the so called 'schocking' elements.To be provocative and thoughtful you need to produce something unexpected and peel it slowly while asking the questions that the audience can relate to. ""Funny Games"" fails to do either. It is an annoying yawn - a film you only can't miss if you want to play artsy with your friends at the chess club.2/10 ( - and only for the plot.

Don't discard or idolize it for wrong reasons.,8,7 March 2004,"The first thought that came into my mind after watching this movie was: ""Am I a normal person? Do a normal, sane individual sits through this entire movie or will he/she just push stop or leave the theater?"". After giving it some thought I really didn't know the answer. So I asked myself: ""Did I like this movie or did I dislike this movie?"" and I found out that I didn't know how to answer that either. I know that I felt bad after watching it and that was the movie's purpose so: should I hate a movie or a director because he/she/it told me an unpleasant story? or should I try to understand the real meaning of this and how it has affected me using what I learn on my benefit?Let's see, for someone that enjoys violence in movies and, I honestly and shamefully admit, sometimes in real life too, this movie kicked my face. People can complain that the objective of this can be achieved with simply showing something to feed the curiosity and sadistic part of people (like animal torturing and more in-your-face videos like mentioned in other post) which lack complete professionalism and merits other than spoiled minds wanting some over-stimulation. Well, I think very differently.I've seen many horrible and violent things that made me feel sick and really bad afterwards but I had never felt a sense of guilt combined with sickness as strong as I felt watching this. Why do I like this movie then? Because the director, actors and the ones involved into this production tried to give me, and everyone that dare to watch this until the end, a lesson, and they did it nicely and without restraints or apologies, like we all deserve it(and with outstanding performances which give you no choice but to take this seriously).Hollywood and the omnipotent, know-it-all media (mainly) have been playing some 'funny games' with all of us, tampering with our sense of reality and never having the decency to remind us that we don't live on a fairytale and that reality is harsh and ugly sometimes.I can choose to forget about this movie and mark it as simply another case of a sensationalist wacko trying to impress me, but I won't do that, mainly because of the strong influence television excerpts on today's society. I will, instead, keep remembering it and, hopefully, when I do that, I'll keep feeling bad and sick as the first time I saw it; as a reminder of what the media's excessive propagandistic influence is doing to our perception of things.I will keep enjoying violence on movies that is true but this movie will always keep yelling at me: ""You know whos fault this is!? you can push stop whenever you like but you won't be able to rewind it.""

127,graham_525,Thought Provoking or Condescending?,10,10 January 2009,"I think there is a valid argument to make that the universal visceral impact that Funny Games has on audiences undermines the very thesis of its director Michael Haneke. I use the word thesis very deliberately because Funny Games is an intellectual academic statement. Plainly it is not an entertainment movie but I don't consider it to be an art film either. Haneke intended it to be neither in my opinion. I think he intended it as an assault on both Hollywood and the audience. It's the cinematic equivalent of punk. Rock music against rock music. This is an analogy Haneke draws the audience to himself by overriding the classical music Anna and Georg are listening to with some extreme punk music on the sound track. We are left in doubt that the world of Funny Games belongs to Peter and Paul. Anna and Georg and their bourgeois taste in music are treated with utter contempt before Peter and Paul even appear on the screen.Getting back to my original point: I think there are two parts to Haneke's thesis. The first is that Hollywood has commodified and sanitised violence and turned it into thrilling entertainment. Hollywood violence doesn't show the reality of violence or its consequences on those it is inflicted on. The second part of his thesis is that Hollywood's portrayal of violence has dehumanised and inured the audience and reduced their capacity for empathy and sensitivity. I fully agree with the first part of his thesis. The problem is most people do. I think you would be hard pushed to find any reasonably intelligent, educated person who doesn't agree with Haneke in this regard. Anyone who doesn't isn't going to be enlightened by watching Funny Games. On this point I can't help feeling that he preaching to the converted.It's the second part of his thesis that he inadvertently undermines. Haneke set out very deliberately to make violence real again so that the audience feels it in their gut. Funny Games isn't real violence though. It's still just a film. However it is a film that manages to make a huge impact on an audience well accustomed to watching violence on the screen. This clearly indicates to me that audiences are smart enough and sensitive enough to be able to tell the difference between Hollywood trite and a convincing portrayal of violence. You could argue that Haneke had to resort to making such an extreme film to have the intended impact on an audience dulled by years of cinematic violence. However Funny Games isn't actually that violent. Compared to the average Arnold Swarzenegger movie it's actually quite tame in both the quantity of violence and how graphically it's portrayed. What makes Funny Games so disturbing is the emotional content in the impact and consequences of the violence on the victims. This is effectively contrasted with the casual approach, understated sadism and emotional shallowness of the perpetrators. If audiences were as lacking in sensitivity as I think Haneke is suggesting then surely Funny Games would have simply have been accepted as another piece of horror entertainment.Haneke said something along the lines that anyone who stops watching before the end doesn't need Funny Games, anyone who watches it to the end does need it. This strikes me as thoroughly arrogant and is quite wrong in my opinion. Nothing can be implied about anyone who watches it to the end and there is no such thing as a film that an audience needs. Funny Games is a superb piece of cinema and there is no doubt that Haneke was fully successful in what he set out to achieve. However what exactly is it that Haneke thinks that the audience needs from it? As I said earlier most of the audience already understands the point he is making about Hollywood. It seems to me that Haneke is trying to shame the audience into realising how immoral they are for watching violent films. I fundamentally disagree with him if this is his intention. Personally I have no problem with the cartoon violence of Hollywood for the very reason that it is lacking in any real emotional content. It would seem that Haneke not only has a problem with the cartoon violence in films but with actual cartoons. Both Tom and Jerry and Beavis and Butthead are referenced in Funny Games. If Haneke is seriously suggesting that Tom and Jerry cartoons are a moral problem then he is beyond ridiculous.Having said all this I still give Funny Games a 10 out of 10. Whether we agree with Haneke or not he made us react, think, defend and argue. He also made a truly remarkable film with some of the most heart breaking and profound acting I have ever seen. Funny Games a deeply intelligent film and I don't doubt Haneke's total sincerity and moral integrity. I just don't necessarily agree with him.",Funny Games
128,tankjonah,"Disturbing and uncomfortable, but a masterpiece!",10,25 February 2006,"Michael Haneke's film Funny Games is far from an enjoyable movie as the family are tortured and humiliated in a frighteningly realistic manner. However, as an exploration of cinema violence, subversion of the conventions of the thriller/horror genre and the role of audience as voyeurs complicit in the actions on screen, this is a masterpiece. Almost all of the violence and humiliation inflicted on the family is off screen, the agonizing cries of the victims are horrible enough.The plot is simple. A wealthy family (Susanne Lothar as mother, Ulrich Muhe as father and Stefan Clapcynski as 8 year old son) arrive at their secluded holiday home. Soon after, a young man (Frank Giering), seemingly a friend of the neighbour, arrives asking to borrow some eggs. When he is soon joined by his friend (Arno Frisch, who played Benny in Haneke's earlier film) the two attack and terrorize the family.Frisch and Giering treat the situation as a game with rules that should be followed. Hence, after Giering wrongly shoots Clapynski who should (according to the rules) have been left alive after being counted in, not out, the two men briefly leave. Refreshingly, it is Muhe who breaks down sobbing uncontrollably after his son's death and it is his wife who comforts him, rather than the reverse as the convention of the genre so often dictates. Throughout the film Haneke revisits his theme of the audience as voyeurs by having Frisch speak directly to the camera (i.e. at us). This may disconcert some, but it is here that the film identifies itself more as an essay on the thriller/horror genre and its conventions, than as violent spectacle for the masses to lap up. Indeed, the majority of the violence is off screen further subverting expectations of audiences desensitized to accepting periodic killings in many a Hollywood thriller. Frisch asks us what he should do in certain situations. He also asks us who we bet on to survive. We're all rooting for the family he tells us. Indeed, given the conventions of the genre we should expect them to survive.The most unexpected, unusual, audacious and possibly groundbreaking moment in the film totally evidences the fictional construction of film, here explored in a different way to say, Bande a Part (Godard, 1965). Here, Lothar manages to snatch the rifle and blow Giering away. Frisch then confiscates the rifle, pushes her aside and then screams for the location of the remote. When he locates it, he rewinds what we have just seen, bringing Giering back to life and preceding to thwart Lothar's effort. This scene may be interpreted in several ways. For the briefest of moments the audience is given what they want to see - the convention of the genre is fulfilled - before Haneke audaciously and cruelly says sorry, screw you and your expectations of the genre. That the film had effectively been thwarting audience expectation throughout, can be evidenced by the fact that when I saw the film various audience members cheered when Lothar killed Giering. Stunned silence and nervous laughter followed Frisch's action with the remote. The scene may also be interpreted as titillation (indeed it is the most explicitly violent moment in the film) which erodes the film's point about violence in film being used as gratuitous entertainment (a view I don't espouse). Finally the scene may also be read as a further point about thwarting expectations that we've all acquired by watching thrillers. Haneke's interest in subverting convention can also be seen via the relationship depicted between the two killers. Frisch often refers to Giering as ""Fatty"" much to the latter's annoyance. This is another means to cue audience expectation. So often, as in Scream (Craven, 1996) for instance, killers working together can become their own worst enemies, ultimately leading to their downfall. Here Giering's displeasure doesn't lead to the two turning on each other, further subverting the expectations and hopes of an audience accustomed to 'the wicked being punished.' Indeed, Haneke refuses to give the audience any simple reason for the behaviour of the killers. Unlike, the multitude of Hollywood thrillers where the killer is revealed to have a history grounded in psychological or sociological disturbance, drug abuse or poverty, Frisch and Giering's characters clearly do not fit into such simple and naïve categorisations. Indeed, throughout Funny Games both killers are referred to as Beavis, Butthead, John, Paul etc, presumably to present them as diverse and non-classifiable. Both are articulate and polite, neither is looking for their next fix and neither are poverty stricken. Rather than depicting the killers as the 'other' Haneke presents them as white, middle class, well dressed and intelligent. The only recent Hollywood film that springs to mind which draws such a complex and disturbing killer is Se7en (Fincher, 1995). Ironically, the denouement in that film dared to subvert expectations and yet (its predictability not withstanding) is considered by some critics to be a weakness.The performances in Funny Games are excellent; Lothar and Muhe particularly stand out. Haneke has created a brilliant, audacious film which is a must see for any serious film buff interested in a commentary on film violence and its effects. The film will invariably stimulate discussion and/or argument amongst its viewers.",Funny Games
129,Carl_Tait,Tedious Faux-Masterpiece,3,24 January 2005,"Having seen and greatly admired Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher,"" I was curious to see ""Funny Games,"" which has garnered such diametrically opposed comments. I expected to be either horrified or mesmerized, or perhaps both.What I didn't expect was boredom. But that's what I got.Imagine ""The Desperate Hours"" starring Laurel and Hardy as the criminals. Add a lot of sadism and take out all the suspense, since it's pretty clear from the start how everything will turn out. And that's about it. Highly unpleasant, but a snore.Oh wait, I forgot. ""Haneke brilliantly lets the criminals make meta-comments to the audience. With sly winks and remarks about 'putting on a good show,' they implicate the film's viewers in the violence taking place on screen, radically shifting the traditional perspective and forcing the audience into an admission of its own voyeurism. Astute viewers are compelled to realize that they, too, have become involved in the grisly proceedings: they *choose* to watch, even though they could use their remote controls to do otherwise, just as one of the killers uses this device to reconstruct his reality in a nonlinear fashion, destabilizing the hegemony of conventional chronology in this masterpiece of blah blah blah.""Double snore. Meta-commentary has been around forever. Check out some of Buster Keaton's films from the 1920s, in which characters comment on how much the stunt men are being paid for their pratfalls. ""Sherlock Jr."" (1924) shatters more boundaries between film and audience than a boatload of Hanekes.On the positive side, the direction, acting, and cinematography in ""Funny Games"" are quite good, but only as far as the script allows. And that isn't very far.3/10. Self-conscious drivel.",Funny Games
130,slimebitch,Worth seeing.,9,8 November 2010,"I watched this film and was fascinated by it. It contains the little things that many movie makers seem to miss out. This film is never boring and it keeps up an interest thanks to the great actors and the story. After watching the original movie I wanted to see the remake with Naomi Watts and am sad to say that this was a flop. I like Naomi as an actress, but the story had been changed a little here and there and all the sudden it was not ""the little things"" special anymore, but seemed to be more about showing up Naomi's underwear :). Naomi is a great actress, but one person doesn't normally make a movie good. In this version I found the actors more sincere and real than in the remake from 2007. I am like someone else who had reviewed the remake, guessing that Haneke wanted to make a remake on his own film only for a bigger public. He made a few changes in the remake also which annoyed me because there was no good reason for them as far as I could see. Remakes can be done better than the original movies if they are made either the same or completely different, but changing smaller details when they were thought through from the start will only make them annoying. This original version was how ever very interesting, so interesting that I didn't want to stop watching it. The bad guy gave me the same feeling that only one person in one role has given me before. That is Robert Carlyle as Adolf Hitler in ""Hitler, the Rise of Evil"". I would say that Haneke had probably found the perfect actors in this first version of this sick and wicked story. Sorry Naomi, you are a terrific actress in the right role, but this remake was not it. In other words I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes seeing odd and funny stories, but not the later version of Haneke's ""Funny Games"".",Funny Games
131,juanathan,Unrewarding,3,2 August 2005,"As soon as the credits rolled at the end of Funny Games, I felt as if the Michael Haneke played a joke. It was like ""Gotcha!"". This is a case when a director has a good idea in mind but completely sabotages it. If this was in the hands of another director, it could have been great. This is how much potential the film had.The film started off very well. A family is playing a game where they play classical music and the father starts to guess the composer. Suddenly, dark heavy metal music plays off screen as we watch there unexpecting faces go along with the music. The metal song would later be used well and then not so well at the end.The film has some considerable merits. There is great acting all around. The director definitely knows how to build tense moments. Some parts were pretty well written.The biggest problem I had with the film was the self reference scenes. I knew before that those type of scenes would be in this but somehow thought the director would pull them off well but he does not. It is painfully obvious in the ""rewind"" scene. I like the whole idea of the ""Show. Don't tell"" type of film-making. Self reference complete shatters that purpose. If I wanted someone to spell it out to me, I would read a book. The movie has a real lack of logic (How is there only one phone in the whole house of a very rich family?) The movie is tedious to sit through. It feels like a chore watching. There is a ten minute one take scene which showed some amazing acting but honestly could have been about four or five minutes. The psychos are clichés of the suave, sophisticated, and charming killers in other superior films. The end is probably the most disappointing. It ends on probably one of the worst clichés you can think of.",Funny Games

Not so simple actually. Far from your usual ""violent-just-to-be-violent"" movie, ""Funny games"" gives a rather complex and clever analysis of how (and why) violence in movies can be attractive to some (most ?) viewers. The thing is : is anyone ready to be this honest ? As it's been said a lot, (really) violent scenes happen off camera, which makes them all the more scary and horrible. It's incredibly well directed, and I've honestly never seen any actors do what Lothar and Muhe do here. Anyone who thinks terrible fascist movies like Oliver Stone's ""Natural born killers"" have some kind of point, or anything interesting to say should try this one... Although they must be warned that here, violence and what goes with it are no funny games.",Funny Games
133,cyberjoshy-49579,Terrible,2,21 June 2019,"Despite all the violence i found this movie to be boring. It played mostly at a single location, barely any music. A very long boring scene past halfway totally slowed the movie down. The violent scenes were tame, ive seen way worse and alot of it was offscreen.The antagonists werent scary or intimidating at all, their clothes made them seem laughable in my opinion, especially the shorts and those long thin legs coming out from under it of the main villian.What annoyed me the most was the lack of resistance by the victims. At the start of the movie (the hostage situation has just begun) some of their friends drop by for a minute by boat. At that point only 1 of the antagonists is present WITHOUT a weapon and 4 adults! 3 woman and 1 guy could easily overpower the dude, walk over to the house and subdue the other guy, or leave and get the police. At this point the bad guy only has a golf club as weapon...
The rewind scene was beyond dumb, totally removed any immersion i had left after all the 4th wall breaking.I would recommend 'the strangers' instead of this. Its a similair premise but executed far better. 'Eden lake' or 'hard candy' are also far more interesting in my opinion.",Funny Games

The results kinda gave me a surprise and the ending was very strange. But this film is just too non-existent and irritating. Very few people will like this movie, but MANY other people will not. So i do not recommend this film to anyone but indie buffs who understands a filmmaker's goal (even if its a disturbing one) to explain what this movie is about (or maybe this director is one sick puppy.)

137,rehensle,Unsettling and intriging by it's abnormal structure,9,6 September 2020,"The formula for blockbuster horror movies are both a blessing and curse. If you treat watching a horror movie like going on a thrilling roller coaster ride, you will appreciate the ques the movie gives you to thrilling moments like a roller coaster prepares you for a drop by slowly and suspensefully moving you up a chain lift. There's something often satisfying about having knowledge about what's going to happen next, which is why horror movies often use foreboding music and shots to build up emotion before the action begins. However because horror movies are often formulaic, down to the point that you have a general sense of which characters will make it out alive based on their character development, viewers can often be desensitized to the violence that happens on screen and a horror movie becomes more of a thrill ride rather than something that is shocking.So some artistic horror movies try to challenge the structure with surrealism, by having actions very unexpected happen to the characters that it shocks viewers who are not prepared. While surrealism is a good technique, it can sometimes feel a bit unsatisfying because it can feel like the surreal elements come out of nowhere. What differs with the surrealism in ""Funny Games"" however is how justified the surreal elements seem. Every action taken by the family that leads them from vacationers to victims of psychotic killers feels rational in a sinister way by the antagonist's dialogue. It's horrifying how everything seems so perfectly set up for the family's demise while simultaneously remaining unpredictable by not following a traditional horror narrative structure.A lot of the movie pokes fun at how desensitizing violence in movies can be and in it's more poignant moments shows the true horror of violence that is often glossed over in movies. For instance, when a character dies in a typical horror movie, their dead body is often displayed for a few seconds before quickly changing focus to the next character of interest. In this movie, there are a lot of extended shots (sometimes for several minutes), that shows the effects the characters feel immediately after the violence they have endured. This is why a lot of people say this movie is sadistic, but much of the violence takes place off screen, and I feel like showing the immediate shock and disillusionment of the makes you re-evaluate how you view the violence in the film. It makes the movie feel much more raw, gripping and even humanistic in a sinister way.Now all of this might sound pretentious. And there's no doubt that director had some pretentious intentions when creating this movie, largely as a response to violence in media. However, the cinematography abnormalities, focus on humanizing the characters and well written sarcastic villains create this really unnerving experience, and it's the first time in a while that I was emotionally shocked by a horror movie. I feel like you don't need to go into 'Funny Games' trying to understand the director's artistic intent to enjoy the surreal experience. If you are expecting a horror movie with horror movie beats this will definitely be a bit disappointing. However if you are looking for a more unusual movie with dramatic and horror elements, then this is definitely worth checking out.",Funny Games
138,Jeremy-4,Why Are You Watching This?,8,8 March 2000,"Unlike my other reviews that have been about the films themselves, this will describe the effect it had on me. Just to clarify, I am an 18-year-old Brit who has seen more than his fair share of violent films, and I thought I could take the content of this one.When I noticed in a listing magazine that Funny Games was being shown, I looked forward to it. I had heard that it was a film about the corrosive nature of movie violence, and contained many unpleasant sequences. This is, of course, the other reason I wanted to see it, the reason I did not admit to myself: I wanted to see the violence.As I was watching the film, I found some of the scenes unpleasant, and understood and agreed with the moral subtext. I wondered in my mind during the commercial breaks who would play the leads in an American remake of the film. It was only towards the end that it occured to me that no-one was going to survive, and that my boredom during long, uneventful shots was partly because I wanted something violent to occur. As the deafening thrash metal played over the end credits, and Paul's empty smile gazed at me, it finally dawned on me what was happening. I did not find the violence in Funny Games repulsive because I have myself become desensitized to it. That is the genius of Haneke. If you decide to walk out of the cinema/turn off your TV/press stop on your VCR, you will have lost the game of Chicken that not only Haneke, but also Peter and Paul are playing with you. You will probably get out unscathed and you will know your limits. If you decide to stay to the end, you win the game, but at what cost? If, like me, you did find such suffering and humiliation intolerable, is that not more disturbing than any violent act you can possibly imagine?That night, I couldn't sleep.",Funny Games
139,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,Michael Haneke is Stanley Kubrick's incarnation: a perfect analyzer of humanity's dark side.,8,19 March 2017,"Michael Haneke (MH) is a not so mainstream director (such as Martin Scorsese for example), but he definitely should be. This review will be based 60% in ""Funny Games"" (FG) and 40% in MH as a director. I find myself very fond of him due to one simple fact: he's a modern-day Stanley Kubrick (SK), which I regard as the best film director/auteur of all time. Dedicated to analyze and explore the dark sides of humanity, he achieves in this film a ""funny"" portrayal of his point of view about Violence.FG is not for the faint of heart. MH has a distaste of how Hollywood portrays violence in movies, which is an explicit and morbid exploitation, which sometimes reaches unhealthy levels. Talking about violence in the film: the film is violent, but you never get to see violent or bloody images. MH loves to take the attention away from those detailed moments to create expectations and make the audience's imagination start playing ""games"". The uncertainty of this moments makes the heavy atmosphere of the flick. The greatest example is: when Paul is making himself a sandwich and you hear the gunshot and consequent screams; you feel desperate for knowing what happened. If the movie was made by a USA filmmaker, it is very probably that you could see what happened, in detail.The film walks between fiction and reality. Paul makes various fourth-wall breaks throughout the movie, and he even rewinds the scene where Anna shoots Peter (not allowing that to happen). Peter, on the other hand, refers and critic many aspects of the traditional suspense rules established by USA films. We are accustomed to seeing the protagonist win and live to tell the tale, well, not here. Paul and Peter even have an interesting discussion about fiction and reality at the end of the film, which makes you think about it afterward.Our main villains: charming well-educated sociopaths that will do whatever they please with whoever they want. Taking Paul as the leader, a little perfect Hannibal Lecter (leaving aside Cannibalism and Psychopathy). In the end, they did everything for just one simple aspect: because they could, and no one has ever told them they couldn't do something.Attention is what MH plays within his movies. He demands complete attention from you to understand. Whether it is with Long Shots or never giving explicit detail of what's going on, MH proves to be a skillful manipulator of the audience to achieve this: you leaving the theater wanting more. We are used to finishing a movie totally satisfied with what we saw and how everything ended (happily ever after). Well, not with MH. He wants you to go browsing and find whatever you can about what you just saw. Most than nothing, he wants you to make your OWN conclusions about the story: ""Caché"" (2005) and ""The White Ribbon"" (2009) for naming two. MH has between 10 to 15 movies to his name, all of them considered good movies, showing different aspects of humanity (often the dark ones), with a perfect sense of direction and meticulous execution. Tell me if this doesn't remind you of SK: Quality before Quantity. It is also important to state the difference between horror and terror. Horror is for fictional and irrational fears (ghosts and supernatural situations), and terror is for real things (a murderer or an accident). This movie is which? Kind of both isn't it?. On one side, you have a home invasion and in the other an antagonist that can manipulate time and space for achieving success. MH said that the movie was a message about violence in media. He said FG was intended to be neither horror nor terror.Something funny is that MH hates Quentin Tarantino (QT), mostly because he mixes violence and comedy, and his violence is extremely satirical. MH has a violent and bold style for most of his movies. He believes that violence portrayed in movies should have a serious and deep approach, special reason why he despises QT's movies. MH's filming style, psychological approach, and audience manipulation are his greatest weapons. He doesn't fear to make a movie of any theme or genre, and whenever he does, the final product is an instant masterpiece. He made a shot-for-shot remake of FG in 2007 with an entire USA crew. The film received mixed reviews. Why? Because it wasn't the kind of violence and suspense USA audiences like. MH wanted to prove a point, and he succeeded. MY FINAL CONSENSUS: Funny Games is out of the question a different kind of suspense and thriller, but a pretty interesting and effective one. Michael Haneke plays with audiences, in order to bring an excellent law-breaker critic of violence portrayal.",Funny Games

The actors did a fine job and the production values were quite good but the content left a lot to be desired. It is certainly not a movie for the faint of heart. A couple, with their young son, arrive at a remote location for a vacation. They encounter a pair of young men who slowly infiltrate their little world and, with menace, first disable the husband (by breaking his leg) and thereafter threaten the child in order to coerce the parents into 'performing' for the two young men who take perverse pleasure in their dominance. It does not end well. And that is the departure from the normal happy ending where the good guys win and the bad guys get their desserts. This is, apparently, the major selling point but I have a sneaking feeling that some 'fans' will seek this movie out for their own perverse pleasure. I realize that there are people who like horror movies for the adrenalin 'rush' and others who are turned on by violence but I am not one of them. I like to watch movies for entertainment but viewed this with some distaste. I was not entertained. True it was tense and menacing - but not thrilling - and devoid of any redeeming features.

It's the kind of movie you don't want to see again. Ever. I found myself shivering during certain scenes and at some point I was even nauseous. Haneke did tremendous job by toying with the audience. While the viewer is watching the family being tortured, the pain is literally transfered from the screen onto the viewer. I had a strange feeling that I'm part of the film. This doesn't happen to you when you're watching ""normal"" movies. Here you're not only the viewer. You're the part of the game. By the way I had to admire the references to Beavis and Butthead or Tom and Jerry, where its entertainment is based on violence and ugliness... in the easy and accepted form of course, but still.

Whereas Hannibal Lector or Clockwork Orange's Alex are intelligent, charismatic and (all killing aside) fun, these 'funny gamesters' are perfect examples of the brutality of the banal. Their games appear to come from a desire to avoid boredom or worse, from staring into the void where they're likely to come face to face with themselves. If it wasn't for the injurious consequences of their antics they would just as soon bore you to death instead.For all the tricks and frustrations this film subjects you to, none of its horrors even comes close to the sheer mental disturbance of the ultra-white, ultra tight tennis shorts as worn by one of the tormentors. In terms of 'all time horrific movie moments', I'd put them right up there with the Exorcist's alternative use of the crucifix or Psycho's shower time etiquette. Be warned, these shorts are only to be viewed by those with a gut like a blacksmith's tool bag.This is probably the only film that has ever been made that is literally asking the viewer ""Why are you watching this?"" Henke's movies generally deal with the extremes of human behaviour but Funny Games employs a series of knowing references to the fact that by witnessing this horror you are somehow complicit in it. The entire film seems to be challenging your continued involvement via explicit devices such as the characters talking about their actions in terms of film structure, and a 'rewind' sequence that will have you calling the Samaritans. Even in the final frame you are subconsciously accused of sharing the psyche of the tormentors by still watching; by which time it's too late and the funny game that has been played here is on you.",Funny Games
145,hmmdrmike,A rollarcoaster of boredom,5,25 January 2005,"What everyone says is true, this movie takes a new, non Hollywood perspective of violence, it pushes the boundaries on what we find acceptable and definitely does exceed the threshold of a ""disturbing"" viewing experience.With that said, it is still a boring movie. The action is slow and the violence (for you gore hounds) is non-existent. The acting is superb... but the script itself is flawed. The characters are far too passive and the lack of dialog definitely restricts the audience from developing a picture of what is happening, who it is happening to... and most of all why they paid to watch a movie with such a slow moving plot.There is a 10 minute stretch in the middle in which nothing happens at all. This movie needed major editing.Will people find this to be an amazing movie? Some will and I do suggest that you watch it. However, don't go in with high expectations, you might be let down like I was.5/10",Funny Games

It won me over completely.Much has been said by other reviewers about the strengths of this superb work.

Ulrich Muhe plays the husband while Susanne Lothar is his feisty spouse.Unlike other similar films, this 1997 release has one of the attackers (Arno Frisch) often breaking the fourth wall by periodically addressing the audience. By making the watcher vicariously partake of the horror, it somehow makes it all the more chilling and difficult to watch.

It's a bit like the torture porn Saw films except the abuse is mostly psychological and you actually care for the characters.A pair of psychotic youngsters hold a family hostage in their vacation home and force them to play sadistic games. It's a harrowing 108 minutes, and at some point I'm sure many viewers will ask ""what's the point of all this?"", but for some reason I found this movie strangely compelling. The suspense is palatable, and the banter between the two deranged captors is somehow perversely fascinating. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion - I couldn't take my eyes off it.As the anguish endured by this poor family worsens, and we become more and more invested in their survival, it begins to feel like the director himself is playing his own twisted game with us; as if he's fully aware of the torture he's putting this family (and us) through, and he's stringing us along and testing our limits.",Funny Games
150,Rapturous_Rich,"Gruelling, mesmerising, unforgivably a masterpiece.",10,21 July 2008,"A film which challenges the institution of violence inherent to cinema was never going to be an easy pill to swallow, and with Funny Games, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke makes damn sure that this is the case. Funny Games is so, so, so much more than simply entertainment. It quizzes you endlessly. It delves into why you'd want to watch something like this. Why you'd want to watch some pour souls suffer at the hands of torturous, teasing foes. Haneke provides a bleak, satirical reality check (leg wounds actually incapacitate, escape plans fail, the good guys don't always win) blasting with a side helping of irony. Breaking the sacred fourth wall of cinema which divides us from them, which keeps our worlds separate and safe, Frisch has several pieces to camera which shock and invoke contemplation. When they make the bet that by 9am the next morning the family will be dead he turns and asks ""what do you think? Ah, you're probably on their side anyway aren't you?"" and towards the end when Lothar, near to hysteria, asks why they're doing it and hasn't it been enough, Frisch retorts with not only some outrageous and, frankly, hilarious false reasons, but turns to us again asking ""what do you think? Has it been enough? Surely you want a plot development?"" Haneke took a wild chance by making a film as ballsy and pretentious as this but it pays of admirably. Towards the end you do find yourself questioning the violence in cinema, and while some may find they cannot make it to the end  which, Haneke has stated, means they have no need for this film, while those that stay do  we are finally delivered one Hell of a boot to the teeth which has been in the waiting since reel one.This film is 100% gruelling, testing just how much you can take, it ups the ante to eleven and as the Haneke-helmed U.S. remake makes it to our screens this year it will undoubtedly be the original which will live on as the true masterpiece it is while the remake gets thrown onto the ever growing mound of Hollywood's failed attempts to incorporate into its own the far superior cinema of the wider world.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk",Funny Games

I just couldn't tear myself away from this film long enough to pour it. To describe this film as intense and disturbing is an understatement.
The effect this film had on me was akin to a near two hour version of the ear slicing scene in Reservoir Dogs. It's an Austrian film, with a small cast but with fantastic acting, particularly the husband and wife. I knew nothing about it till it started tonight. I wont give away the story but it is a very simple one and basically deals with the question of film/screen violence and its relationship with violence in real life. It's done in a very effecting and thought provoking way and I'm sure I'll remember it for a long time.

While you could write a book on the topic, I'll keep my thoughts short: humans have a fundamental craving for violence, and I can differentiate violence in media from violence in reality. His message just ended up falling flat. There wasn't any deeper criticism of violence and I didn't walk away feeling wrong or like I should have a new perspective on the matter. Yet I still didn't dislike it... The film was expertly crafted for his intentions, was adeptly acted, and I was kept engaged. Does that make me his target? Is it just pretentiousness?

153,rserrano,The Game is being played on you,7,18 August 2004,"This is not so much a movie as it is about the experience of watching movies and what it says about our fears and desires. There are two basic reasons for watching a movie from the classic ""home invasion"" genre. One is to be entertained and the other is to somehow rid ourselves of our fears by facing them in a low risk way. In both cases it is the director who is piling the ""funny games"" on us, with our compliance.Notice that the poster for this movie shows a frightening image reflected in an eye. It is as though that eye is a window into the inner psyche and that the camera is peering into our fears. In the case of entertainment, this can only work if we are so scared out of our wits that we forget whatever else was worrying us in our everyday life and thereby see it in perspective. There are however conventions that are required for making this work. The source of the fear [ie. the bad guys] must get what's coming to them and there must be a happy ending. Notice your reaction when you get neither. The remote trick pulls back the satisfaction of revenge and the ending makes it clear that the fear not only hasn't gone away but instead must be relived again and again!Arno Frisch [the skinny bad guy] can be viewed as the director who periodically peers at us thru the camera, smirks and reminds us that we are watching a movie, and reveals to us the funny games that he and other directors play on us at our insistence.",Funny Games
154,norman-42-843758,Plagiarism or Prophecy ?,8,4 June 2011,"I have broken my own rule here of reading a few other reviews before writing my own. I try to make my own mind up before being influenced by others thoughts but in this case I was just too damn curious. Sure , I agree with the person who said about Lethal Weapon being a fun film and death being a vehicle of entertainment. It is sad it has gone this way but in that respect I have to hold my hands up and admit to liking Midsomer Murders where the object is to try to guess the culprit from the dwindling cast. I say this so as not to be two faced about my thoughts towards this film. As others have commented, this film can be viewed on two levels, either at face value or looking for a deeper meaning. At a face value level it can be compared directly with the 1997 Graeme Campbell film Murder One. This is a rather pedestrian retelling of true events which happened in Maryland in 1973. Here three psychotic low life no brainers escaped from a high security prison, picked up the teenage brother of the gang leader and then went on a killing spree. They killed six members of one family including a pregnant woman who was forced to watch her family being methodically exterminated before being gang raped and finally shot in the back. This is the only time I have seen reviews on IMDb from people who have never seen the film. They say they were close enough to the real events for it to leave them mentally scarred and they have no desire to see the retelling on film.If we view Funny Games as a cautionary tale of senseless violence in films then that is not altogether a bad thing. Perhaps I am reading too much into it but I saw It as more than that; moreover as an indictment of falling standards generally. I am old enough to remember black and white television from the end of the 50's and the public bewilderment when Lady Isabel Barnett came on the panel game What's My Line with a plunging neckline that revealed two inches of décolletée. That was the talk of the queue in the butchers shop for a week afterwards, I can tell you. My mother was convinced it was a trick of the studio lights. ""A real Lady of the land would not publicly expose herself on television in that shameless way"" she said. But it was no trick of the lights and the viewing public were treated to a look at the top two inches of Lady Barnett's tits. How naff it all seems now. Very few commercially successful films nowadays get away without having their required smutty bits. Technology didn't help,either. The Korean War was something on the other side of the world and not something to get in the way of everyday life unless there was someone close to you over there. By the time Vietnam came around people could see battles in real time taking place with their TV dinners on their lap. It was a case of ""Honey, pass the chips and dip"" as soldiers were blown into a thousand pieces before your eyes. The population were numbed down and dumbed down.Plagiarism or not, Michael Haneke cannot have been unaware of Murder Ones existence before making Funny Games. If it is prophecy then events depicted seem to have been somewhat preceded. In this age of reason it is however well that someone is awake and saying ""This is the path we are treading. Take stock of the situation or fall deeper into the abyss"". Do we stop with this mental insensitivity or is it to be more Christians to the lions; cheering at public hangings and snuff movies for all? This leads on to the thorny question of censorship. At a time when we are pushing back the boundaries of science and technology should we not, on a social level, break free of prim Victorianism? But to what end when self regulating standards of decency seems not to be working any more.",Funny Games
155,arcticcarrot,Perhaps the most manipulative film I've ever seen,6,4 January 2010,"All films manipulate the audience - of course that's true, just by their nature. But watching this film, you just get the feeling that the director feels he's so much smarter than his audience. If you get the DVD, there is an interview with the director, where he says something like, ""If you watched the film to the end, then you needed to see it to the end."" Basically he's saying that if you watch the whole film, then you're the type of person who needs to learn the lesson about how violent movies manipulate their audiences, how they engage the audiences to cheer the violence. That's a pretty bloody conceited and arrogant stance. Also, in the interview, he says that he hates writers who think of their characters as weak or unintelligent, and that he himself gives his characters intelligence. This is a lie. The wife in this film is an idiot. When she first meets one of the attackers, he seems harmless enough, but he's wearing surgical gloves. She doesn't find this the least bit odd? She doesn't even seem to notice, though when she hands him some eggs, her hands touch his. And then a little later she has a chance to get help, when a boat full of her friends pulls up to her dock. All she has to do is tell them to call the police, because at this point the attackers have already killed her dog and broken her husband's knee - so she knows they're serious. But she doesn't do this. She gives no indication that anything is wrong at all. In fact, she goes out of her way to show that everything is normal, even introducing one of the villains to her friends (which then leads to the predictable and annoying ending). So how intelligent does the director really consider this character? I have a problem with films in which a character can do something very obvious which will end the story right there, but doesn't do it. Still, the film has some pretty amazing moments, and is still worth watching. I thought about giving it a 5, but there is a scene that I thought was fantastic - I don't want to give it away here, but it's something I haven't seen before in a film. The director's entire point in this film is that violent films make the films' audience just as guilty of the violence as the fictitious villains within the films. And to show this, he has one of the villains talk directly to the audience several times. It is an interesting point, that audiences are complicit in the violence of the films they watch. But if that's true, aren't the writers and directors that much more complicit? And isn't this film itself a violent film?",Funny Games
156,aprovost-2,Funny Games is an allegory,8,18 July 2006,"I found this one of the most distasteful films I had ever seen. That is, until the next day, when it became clear to me that it was an allegory for the Holocaust. I won't go into all the parallels I drew, but I am sure many of you will see what I mean on re-viewing this film. The eggs, for instance, at the beginning I think represent the wealth of the Jews in pre-War Germany contrasted with the needs of those with less (the two visitors). The couple shared their eggs, but they wanted more and thus attributed their want to the owner's greed. Also, think how the Nazis used fear to turn family members against each other. The film opens with the rich couple in their luxury car playing games about recognizing music rather than really listening to it. Was the dog a German shepherd by design? When one of the victims could escape, she didn't. Their innocence after the eggs situation reflects the German Jews unwillingness to recognize the signs of the coming holocaust. One of the games was obviously a Nazi-style ""Sophie's Choice"" exercise in terror. I am adding to my review, though I haven't seen the film in years and know there are many other parallels which other viewers will fnd it they look for them. A very disturbing, but important, film.",Funny Games
157,SchimoCro,Special film with film as a main theme,7,9 January 2013,"Different movies have different goals and Haneke's Funny Games is very special on this issue. The story is simple, rich family: father George, mother Anna, and their son George Jr., goes to vacation in their weekend cottage. Their social status is accentuated during the film through expensive car, large cottage, classic music, boat, golf, their rich friends etc. It's one of the ways in which Haneke attempts to give viewers a reason to justify suffer of this family during the film. Once we get familiar with this idyllic family, Paul and Peter enter the story. They are psychotic young men dressed entirely in white with white gloves that we notice at the beginning of the film in a neighboring house in a strange conversation with the owners. Interaction with family starts with innocent asking for egg by two of them that quickly turns into irritating farce after which Anna and George try to force the duo out of the house, but that attempt ends with George's broken leg and the torture begins. Story continues with 'games' that psychotic duo 'plays' with family, like hide and seek with the body of a dead dog and the main 'game' is a bet with the family that none of them will survive the next 12 hours.Haneke's main goal is to make viewers reject violence in film industry that became main plot of entertainment. He tries to do that with putting the same senseless violence, that they enjoy on film, in a home of normal family and his desire is that the viewer stops watching the film before it ends. The main moment in which viewer should stop watching is scene after the first death which lasts for few minutes in which absolutely nothing happens, just shows the horror of violence and its consequences. The film also serves as a kind of experiment in which Haneke is trying in various ways to give excuses for terror that the family goes through, and even in some moments one of young men looks into the camera, winks and speaks to the viewer with a sad statement that he is surely on the side of the victims.There's small chances that anyone would enjoy the story, which ultimately is the whole idea. The technical part on the other side is well done. Acting is also at a high level, especially from duo Giering-Frisch who embodies Peter and Paul. The objection goes to the failure to use the high-capacity Ulrich Mühe who plays George and spends most of the film lying on the floor. This is a special film with film as a main theme, specially the violence within it and in most of cases it fulfills it's purpose, at least in short terms.",Funny Games

The director is using some tricks in order to make the film less boring. For example the killer is looking at the camera and talks to the audience. Charming... 
Then, totally unnecessarily, he deliberately delays some scenes. Or maybe not so unnecessarily. The film would be too short without all those tormenting (but only for the viewer) minutes where we have to watch every single moment of the victims crawling or the view of the house at the night for 15 seconds with no reason.

159,kleinjeremy,I just don't get it.,4,8 November 2019,"I just finished this film, and the strongest emotion I felt was anger. The sadists in this film just act like frat boys jerks, and I simply didn't like them. I also felt somewhat angry at the director for coming off as prideful, even if I get the message he was going for. Sometimes, I did feel emotion for the family's plight, but I accidentally spoiled the villains would rewind time by the end of the film, and it immediately broke my suspension of disbelief for the rest of the time. Honestly, most of the emotion I felt towards this film occurred in the first half. By the time I reached the second half, I was fast-forwarding, looking at other pages on my computer, and overall not caring much about the film anymore.Is it supposed to be a very real depiction of violence to make us not like violence in films? It sort of accomplishes its goal, but... then it doesn't. Or, is it supposed to be fantastical and call its viewers perverted? Well, it kind of accomplishes that goal too, but then, it's a bit too grounded for that to work. Furthermore, the fact that the film elicits such a strong reaction from people probably shows that the films depicting violence in silly ways, such as Kill Bill, aren't a problem at all. And most of the time, they truly aren't.There's no real winning in reviewing this film, though. I didn't like it, but those who did like it would tell me I wasn't supposed to. I didn't hate it, but people who did hate it would tell me it was completely pointless and I should hate it more. Some people would say that, either way, the film ""wins"" in a sense. But, no, films don't really win anything, because they're just that... films.You might be reading this review thinking that I don't have anything to say, and I guess I really don't. I wouldn't be writing a review about this film if people weren't so impassioned about it on both sides, though. I just don't have a huge amount to say about it, and other than the minor anger and emotion I felt, the film just didn't really stand out to me either way.I do have a few opinions on things in it, though.-The second act of this film is definitely the strongest. I was most engaged when Georg Jr. was trying to escape, and when he saw his friend dead.-I cannot stand the song they played in the intro and later in the film. I don't know why they chose it unless they were genuinely trying to be unpleasant, in which case... Okay? I guess? It's just a weird choice.-The father was characterized very well by the end. He was the most interesting character.-Some of the antics of the villains are actually a bit funny. The beginning scenes, where Tom (is that his name? Did he even have a name?) breaks a bunch of eggs. It was just a really awkward scene, and it felt oddly playful. And, although I can understand the intent behind it and think it's kind of genius in its own way, the killer literally rewinding time with a remote at the end is one of the silliest things I've ever seen in a movie. I couldn't take it seriously after knowing that would happen. I was literally trying to convince myself it wouldn't, but then it did. The director, Haneke, would probably say I'm part of the problem for thinking this, but... Violence in movies is not all bad.-This film makes me want to purchase a handgun to protect myself in case of home invasion. Something tells me the director wouldn't be too happy about that, though.So all in all, I'd say this film is a 4/10 in my book? I don't know what else to give it. Even for all I've written, I don't feel like I have any actual opinion on the quality of the film as a whole. Give it a watch if you can stomach it, and form your own opinion.",Funny Games

From what I have seen in the news bulletins or read in the newspapers, it can be worse than this. I was unable to feel sympathy for the victims in this movie because not only they were stupid, but also wimpy. The dog is a symbol of their flimsiness: a big German shepherd, perfectly trained, who barks a lot but does not bite and gets killed by a golf club hit. Pathetic. Even a kitten would have put a better fight. OK, the woman allowed the young man into the house, but that is not the point. The point is that when the man knew something was wrong with the boys...you just don't slap the aggressor. Only prostitutes do that when they squabble for the best place to expose their merchandise. If you have to touch the aggressor, you do it with the fist, in such a manner that he does not get up from the floor. OK, the film goes on, the kid escapes from the house and cannot jump over the gate. When I was his age, I could climb straight trees using only their bark for support. A gate like that would have been a piece of cake for a boy that did something else with his butt other than sit on the couch playing video-games for years. FFD...FFD...the 2 aggressors leave the area just like that, leaving the victims in the house, alive. No matter how crazy he is, a criminal always wants to escape. What if that mobile phone would have worked? This part of the script does not stand. No criminal would leave himself vulnerable to so many variables. And a few scenes later, the woman gets caught by the evil guys. I can't speak for others, but if I am in the middle of a road and someone drives a car in my direction, I can identify it 1 mile before it reaches me. I know the headlights, the silhouette, the humming of the engine. I can recognize it from 100 cars of the same type. The woman gets caught by the baddies that were driving the family car. Pathetic. And in the end, when the victims realize their fate, instead of becoming uncooperative and raging with fury, they just do what the murderers tell them to do. Even if they know they will still die. Can something be more pathetic than that? The 2 villains in this movie are like 2 karate instructors. Sure, they can hurt you during the training, but you will learn something from them.

One thing that I can't stand is being lectured to, and this film is essentially just the director ranting about how bad horror is. Naturally, I cannot relate to that position, I tend to find non-horror work to generally be rather dull (non-horror b-movies being excepted, of course; I always enjoy a good b-movie, regardless of genre). In effect, this is Mary Whitehouse-level ""all this awful violence and horror is corrupting the youths"" type puritanical extremism masquerading as provocative intellectual cinema.

Under this aspects the director did a good job. But I don't think that a movie about violence should generate other violence. Horror movies are full of violence but are generally blatantly fake, and that kind of violence, even if gratuitous is a sort of harmless fun. Movies like Clockwork Orange give us some antihero who we sympathize for, but there is some deep analysis of the phenomenon of violence and it's a movie that makes you think and is beautiful as a piece of art.I think that the old cathartic function of drama representing reality should still exist, otherwise we end to watch movies like this that have no point and that maybe could be used for some kind of ""reconstruction of the facts"" in a tribunal. 5/10 because it succeeds in capturing me, but it does in the wrong way.",Funny Games

It is interesting to read the other comments, especially from those who hated it. I found the movie absolutely gripping. I couldn't stop watching it. I hated the torturers so much that I wanted to jump into the screen and strangle them. This may be the point: you can have a great movie about repulsive things. It is very frustrating to watch, but that was intended. The two near escapes were as tense as any scene I've watched anywhere. I think the final verdict is that this is a must see unless you're overly sensitive. This idea can be applied to a film such as Schindler's List, repulsive in many parts, but still a great piece of art.",Funny Games

Also the part where the psychopath spoke to the viewers and put the film back destroyed everything. It brings a feeling like the movie is a joke. The movie really managed to annoy me because of these 2 psychopaths.

I will probably not see it again.I'm no hardcore horror or action fan but I've nothing against violence in movies. Hey, I love ""The Killer"" with its aesthetic shoot-outs and choreographed slow-mo killings. I still will after seeing ""Funny Games"". However I might think differently about the way violence is portrayed in this movie and others. I'm glad that I saw this film - and I'm sorry that I didn't switch off my VCR before it was over.And I'm seriously wondering how anyone could view this movie as something like a ""black comedy"" or even slightly ""entertaining"". There is no entertainment in ""Funny Games"" - not by my definition. Not by anyone's I know ...",Funny Games

It's difficult to make a coherent, original statement about violence in western culture. Having the killers talk to the camera serves to distance the audience rather than disturb and  reveals the film to be a pretentious construct. The choices made by the tortured family are puzzling and frustrating. The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is so academic and flat. I'm really tired of this type of film.",Funny Games
172,sfmonkeyboy,Good start but turns to dreck,3,16 August 2006,"I was intrigued by this movie's description and it's reviews both on here and on Netflix. I finally rented it and watched it last night, and have to say it started out very promisingly, with a believable cast of actors and a pretty good story line. HOWEVER - when the first assault on the family occurs (one of the thugs hits dad in the knee with a golf club) no one really fights back. At a couple of spots the eight year old son goes after them, and mom tries once, but most of the time they either try to rationalize with the psychos (which they should have realized was a waste of time after dad got knee-clubbed), whimpering, or sitting and staring. Keep in mind, now, this is a family of three against two guys initially armed with a golf club. A GOLF CLUB!!! Why mom didn't reach over and pull out a mashie niblick of her own to start whaling on the guys is beyond me. And two of the family manage to escape during the movie, only to be caught and brought back by the thugs. First the son escapes and is captured, okay, you could believe that, after all, the kid's only eight; but then (spoiler) after the kid has been shot and killed the thugs tie up the parents and then LEAVE THE HOUSE! Mom and Dad finally get the gumption to get each other unbound and then they sit and try do dry out a wet cell-phone battery to call for help, rather than getting the hell out of there. They are in their summer home on the lake, they have a boat (we saw dad and son getting the boat all rigged up and ship-shape early in the movie) so why didn't they get on the boat and sail away? Perhaps the boat was scuttled by the thugs, you may query. Nope - the boat is in ship-shape condition for the thugs to drag mom (alive and bound and gagged again) onto, sail out on the lake, and push her overboard where we assume she drowns. The real breaking point for me on this movie wasn't the occasional asides the thugs made to the camera, making it seem like there was perhaps a third person involved and they were filming it for their own sick amusement later; but when mom grabs a shotgun and gutshoots one of the thugs and kills him. The other thug screams and starts yelling ""where's the remote?"" and finds the remote, and (get this) REWINDS the movie to before the shooting. They then re-do the scene so that when mom makes a grab for the rifle she doesn't succeed. So now it's a matter of is this movie a docu-drama, a psychological thriller, or a bit of sci-fi fantasy? I think they really missed a good point there, it should have continued on from the mom killing the one thug (at last they fight back) and the remaining thug carries on without his pal. The rewind thing just turned the whole movie into something unbelievable and ridiculous.",Funny Games

It's 'shocking' (on the DVD backcover), but it's not shocking enough (self-censored); it's 'terrifying', but actually it's interminably dull & dumb; it's not radical enough (even by late 90s standards), and it's too insincere. Haneke seems interested in *telling* what the audience should see, how they ought to feel - perhaps then 'lectures' would be a better word for it than 'games'.Misery, Death & the Maiden, Hard Candy (just to name a few in this 'genre') are infinitely superior.",Funny Games
174,hjpog,Michael Haneke's great criticism of violence..,10,4 April 2017,"First of all, the film has an excellent critique of violence. There are many things in the movie that can disturb the spectator. This should be the goal in the film. Punishing for the preferences of the audiences. The theme of violence is really making a spectacular presentation of the spectator. The use of a particular costume by the violent team may bring A Clockwork Orange to mind. Maybe this can be inspired by the production. But it's definitely a whole different movie. There are many things in the movie that characterize the audience as a movie. Especially the main characters talk to the audience constantly and the control scene in the final is a good example of this. In the film, the audiences who desire the salvation of the family since the beginning, the control scene may ruin. Also at the beginning of the film, the blade in the boat appeared later, referring to the last minute surprises in Hollywood movies. The biggest event in the film might be to use violence without showing. Maybe the violence in the film is outside the frame, but it can affect it much more than the films that make it into show. The film explains that there is actually no reason for the violence, and this is a simple game. It's quite annoying, but it's also a surprising and thought-provoking film. In my opinion, the director intended to make the violence common by communicating with the audience in the film. In this case the director has done a great job of making the spectator empathize. The film looks like a very simple perverse side neighbor story but does not have a happy ending guarantee like in Holllywood-made movies. For example, Disturbia 2007 or Fright Night 2011. There is hope in the film for a happy ending but the director never gives it to the audience. This makes the film different. Especially the control scene, it seemed like there would not be an ending as you want the audience. One of the most influential scenes in the film is the scene where the family's child died. A television screen covered with blood, an ongoing car race on television, and the blood of the child we have not even seen, show us one of the greatest emanations of real life violence. In addition, there is criticism of the stereotypes through the use of metal music and handsome killers which are always used in such films. I think the main idea in the film is to be careful that the white color can not always symbolize the goodness of innocence. This event reminded me of A Clockwork Orange movie. The film is full of great criticism from start to finish about the needlessness of violence. In addition to that, I can say that these lines from the film explain unnecessary violence perfectly for me; George: Why are you doing this? Peter: Why not? The film is dealing with the viewer and the film never gives the final that the viewer wants. People who have been exposed to classic Hollywood productions that we call audience. To sum up, Haneke shows us the antithesis of classic thriller films. End overall, the film is a masterpiece of Michael Haneke's criticism of violence and Hollywood stereotypes.",Funny Games
175,Sickcess,The very definition of a clever disturbing movie,10,21 April 2014,"I can without exaggeration say I have seen almost everything there is to see when it comes to disturbing movies, and yet I think ""Funny games"" might have been the one that moved me the most. At least it's among the top 3. This movie is not gratifying in the least, and that is what makes it so powerful (even though I totally enjoy gratifying movie violence as well). I haven't really gotten into the home invasion genre that much, but those movies I have seen so far have been quite good. But in spite of that I can almost with complete confidence say that this is by far the best one out there. It's so good you might consider skipping the rest of the movies in the genre. Or perhaps not. ""The last house on the left"" is also very good. And if you like the genre ""The house on the edge of the park"" is OK also. But ""Funny games"" is definitely crushing the competition. So the story is simple enough. A father, a mother and their kid goes on vacation in a secluded house near the sea. There two men in their early twenties shows up, first acting friendly, but soon starts act weird. The weirdness escalates to mild harassment, followed by violence and from then on it gets worse.There is very little blood in the movie and no graphic violence whatsoever. Everything is implied. What this movie does is playing extremely heavy on the emotions, which is done with almost perfect balance. An excellent example is the scene that follows the first kill.And balance is the key word for the entire movie. The music score is limited to when the characters plays music, which was an excellent choice. This movie does not need music to lift the emotional tension! The little music there is features, together with some great classical music, music by the extremely talented, multifaceted and to most people unknown musician John Zorn.Also, three or four times, one of the killers turns to face the viewer, making comments about what is going on in the movie, which is also made in a very balanced way. It could be seen as a cheap move, but here it really works and ads to the overall feeling. Two reasons why it works, is because it is done very moderately, with three or four very short segments, and because of what is said.You also get to know the family a bit, just enough to like them. They are intelligent, kind people with good taste and they have an intelligent, well mannered kid. In many violent movies these days the victims are either not likable or you don't get to know them at all.The killers are also interesting. You don't get to know anything for sure about their backgrounds, but they are well mannered, calm and seemingly friendly. And the point is, they don't seem to have any reason whatsoever for doing what they are doing. There is in general a lot going on with the ways the killers behave and talk, but I will leave that to you to figure out. But keeping that in mind will probably enhance your experience of the movie.The acting is great both when it comes to the family and the killers. The emotions portrayed are very convincing, and the killers are creepy in a very unique way.This movie is about making the viewer reflect over how he/she views violence in modern culture. In my view it does this without being preachy. It is a clever reflection over senseless violence, where the senselessness and sorrow, rather than the violence, is rubbed in the viewers face. I felt really empty after watching this movie. And again, this was done in a very minimalistic way. I don't give out a lot of 10:s, but I think this move definitely deserves it.",Funny Games

I read some of the positive reviews but I cannot see any of the redeeming virtues pointed out. The 'analysis of violence' excuse for indulging in carnage is perhaps the most overused in the history of recent cinema. Even if we buy this excuse, it is a poor movie. It is an analysis that doesn't say anything that hasn't been said before.

It had the usual 'what would you really do' type flaws, like when they stand around having deep conversations with the killers just outside the door, but this film has courage, and it works. It works the same way as most foreign films that are successful in the US work, by shocking us to the core by not following the same tired old formulas. ""Ok, now he's going to... Oh, sh_t, where did that come from?"". That's what I expect from a movie.

180,braugen,The viewers are to blame!,9,1 July 2003,"Austrian director Michael Haneke came up with the idea of making this film after his trilogy about alienation (Der Siebente Kontinent, Benny's Video and 71 Fragmente...). It is a self-reflexive film about violence in the media, and it clearly points to its own factitiousness on several occations, which makes it really difficult to accept that people do not like the film, or that they were frightened by it. This is not a frightening film, but it is frightening that people are frightened by it. You must be stupid to be scared during ""Funny Games"", I believe people are more likely to be repulsed than scared. Repulsed by themselves because they are to blame for the violence in this film. Haneke pulls out a number of Bertolt Brecht- inspired asides to the camera that makes this film a reflexive masterpiece, a film that offers its viewers a clear argumentation of why film violence is not consumable, why it never can or should be entertaining to watch violence. ""Funny Games"" is almost anti-film, it is obviously not a classic film, and it is closer to the work of Jean-Luc Godard than any violence-obsessed Hollywood director. ""Funny Games'"" false mask is removed several times when the sadistic, violent young man Paul (or Beavis or even Jerry) stops the film time and steps into a conversation with the audience. ""Is it enough? Really? Don't you want a plausible development?"" he says coolly and disturbingly to the audience, who by now should know this is an experiment and not a thriller. The violence in this film, in contrast to American genre films such as thrillers, action films and horror films, is invisible. The consequences of the violence, though, are visible and feels painstakingly real. This is not an exciting film either, because Haneke either leaves out or totally turns around all the ""rules"" of a horror film. The message in this film is what I believe viewers who do not like it reacts strongly to. The film clearly is an attempt to make the audience expose themselves and their wish to see people killed on film. Its meaning is that the audience understands their role as the initiators of the killings and violence, and that they never want to see violence on film again. The violence in the media gives us a wrong impression of what violence is, because violence is real and it should not feel good to see fictional violence. It should hurt, and because it's your fault that it happens, it should hurt to watch it, too. The French director Gaspar Noé seems to have understood this when making ""Irréversible"", which is the best film about violence since ""Funny Games"". With this film, Michael Haneke wanted his audience to never indulge in visual, violent pleasures again. Unfortunately, it left many people so cold they never want to see a film by Haneke again. That is a shame: He is a director with a conscience.",Funny Games
181,margus-kiis,Deeper idea is largely lost,7,21 January 2006,"Of course this film movie is psychologically very effective. We all are afraid of violence, we're heard about serial killers, psychos etc, we all have some kind of fear to be victims of them in our homes. Haneke is just playing with these kind of fears. Simple. Almost every comment about this film is talking about violence, violence, violence. Yes, this is the core of the movie. But nobody is seeing the other aspect of the movie which is main idea of the movie -- the irony and criticism about Western middle class family and people. Anna, Georg and son Gergie are typical German rich middle class family. They are spending their summers in idyllic summer house besides the lake. It's nice place but -- more important -- seemingly safe. Summer houses' block is rounded with tough fence, the place is guarded, no lower class people, no strangers. No criminals -- at least they think so. But the middle class people doesn't know that they are locked into real prison. And in prison are the laws of prison. We don't know but it seems that these two evil guys are from the same middle class too. They wear golf suits and carrying golf sticks -- typical symbol of 'classy' people. But they know that they are in isolated playground. They knows that in this kind of society only stronger gets all the power, only stronger stays alive. Haneke demonstrates us several times the idiotic helplessness, nonsense behavior of typical comforted rich people. Evil guys are leaving family alone after (accidental?) killing of Georgie. And Anna and Georg are just acting like two real idiots. They doesn't know the number of police, they don't know what to do at all. All their decisions are just wrong. They are just not able to survive in different situations and deserving their death. Using psychologically effective methods Haneke have made impressive film. But violence is too strong and deeper meaning I described is just lost in public mind. They just see lot of painful violence but not see the critique towards them. So I don't know is the movie very good or not.",Funny Games

Mientras la veía, pensé en todos los clichés vistos en los thrillers de terror de este tipo, y cómo esta película los abordó a propósito, para destruirlos y darles un giro inesperado, jugar con las expectativas y hacer que el público se riera nerviosamente cada vez que la cuarta pared se rompió o se aplastaron las oportunidades para que los protagonistas salieran aireados. Al final, pensé, no es por nada que lleva el nombre que lleva, Funny Games, llegando a la conclusión de que la película en sí era un juego macabro con el espectador, transformando un espectáculo libre de culpas como una película, en un experiencia que te hace cuestionarte cuando te ves a ti mismo presenciando violencia explícita, en una película, en un videojuego, en un cómic o, lo que es peor, en la vida real, por la sencilla razón de que no te afecta, creyendo que tu conciencia está limpia y que no eres responsable, pero Funny Games intenta hacerte entender que sí, eres responsable, porque eres cómplice.

184,lexo1770,The worst kind of serious film,1,21 February 2008,"I watched 'Funny Games' out of interest mixed with skepticism, because I had read a lot of the director's comments about how if you couldn't watch it all the way through, you didn't need to, etc. This seemed to me like a remarkable high-handed attitude for a film director to take, as if the inability to watch his film was somehow proof of the viewer having a more beautiful soul than that of somebody who can sit through the whole thing without dropping their popcorn.I realised fairly quickly that 'Funny Games' is not a movie in the conventional sense of being a filmed dramatic fiction designed to give the viewer a satisfying aesthetic experience. Oh no. It's some sort of art gesture, designed to make Michael Haneke feel like he's doing something special, something higher than other film-makers.I don't like Quentin Tarantino's films not because they are very violent, but because I find them boring; I don't like all the trashy B-movies that Tarantino is in thrall to, so I don't appreciate it when he cannibalises their plots and motifs for his own stuff instead of writing about real people. 'Funny Games' is nothing more than a humourless art-house version of a Tarantino movie, in which the smirking protagonists systematically terrorise a family and wink at the camera throughout, asking us if we want to keep watching. I kept watching because I was getting more and more angry at Michael Haneke's pompous disapproval of my viewing habits.Why shouldn't we want to keep watching? It's only a movie. I am a fan of serious film directors like Robert Bresson, Michael Powell and Jacques Rivette, and I appreciate films that make me think, but I do not appreciate some pretentious fool behaving as though an essentially cheap exploitation film is making some sort of grand comment about violence in cinema. Haneke is an untalented, pretentious and humourless director who disguises his inability to tell good stories by tricking up his films with silly gimmicks that give intellectual film reviewers handy talking points. He did it with 'Hidden' and he does it here. He is a one-joke phony.I am not the only person to find 'Funny Games' a stupid and intellectually indefensible waste of time, a B-movie with delusions of significance. Jacques Rivette, a real film-maker, called it a 'disgrace, a piece of s***' in an interview. I watched it all the way through. I came away depressed and demoralised by a world in which people think that s*** like this means something.",Funny Games

187,omarramonmuniz,Premise,5,18 March 2007,"Director Michael Haneke said in a DVD interview about his film Funny Games that the film was an exhibition of how audiences consume violence. I'm paraphrasing of course, but he makes it clear that this was his premise. And in addition, he tried to show how we, as voyeurs by nature, act as accomplices to violence. Though Funny Games is well made, it fails to reach Haneke's premise. The reason is simple. There aren't any motifs in the film to lead the average moviegoer to that conclusion. The one theme that is consistent (though mainly in the last act of the script), is that of the audience member being a character in the scene. This is done in clever fashion, as we learn that the culprits are filming their crimes. However, this does not insinuate a tongue-in-cheek satire about violence in media. Because the premise of the film does not match the director's claim, the meaning of the film itself is diminished. Directors of violent feature length films have a tendency to justify their films by claiming that the film is a commentary on society. It's a convenient cop-out in some cases, especially this one. Case in point: A film that sucsessfully satirizes how the media sensationalizes violence is Man Bites Dog (1992). The film is shot in documentary style and our subject is a consciousless serial killer who finances a film being made by penniless filmmakers who soon enough becomes just as involved in the murders than the serial killer. The reason why this is more successful than Funny Games is because the film's comedic themes are maintained throughout. The comedic approach to a disturbing subject matter is an indicator that the film is a satire. In Funny Games there is both a comedic and tragic approach that is juggled throughout, making the intended premise unreachable. The torturers maintain the comedy and the family maintains the tragedy. Consequently, there are no indications of a satire. In fact, the most crucial point of the film, ""the rewind scene,"" disproves the director's intended premise by introducing a world of fantasy when the only thing the viewer knows up until this point (as well as after this point) is a world of brutal reality. It's sloppy art and it's by far the low point in what was otherwise a well made film. Haneke has a track record of making films about motiveless violence. That is all this film is about, nothing more and nothing less. There is no difference between this film and other torture film that are more horror-oriented. By torture films I'm referring to films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I Spit on Your Grave, as well as newer ones like Hostel and Wolf Creek. The killers in Funny Games are written a whole lot better and its brutality is admirable. What diminishes the film is the preteniousness of the director and ""the Rewind Scene."" Man Bites Dog is a much better alternative.",Funny Games

Two psychopaths are on a rampage of death and deception, with no clear motif they hunt rich families in most suave manner by playing games, bluffing, discussing their career paths and pseudo-science, and all the while winking at the viewer. Haneke smirks on our experience of watching and predicting films/stories, he points out and flips over all the defaults that gives the viewer a sense of attachment with the protagonist, a build-up leading to excitement in his suffering, instills fear for his safety/success and finally saves him for that happy ending. This film is not exclusively of effluent well mannered people who listen to Bjorling, Tebaldi and Gigli and go to secluded posh villas on holidays and are vulnerably helpful. It's about anyone who is not hunting; it's about the total control of the hunter over his kill i.e. the games he plays with them by the rules he makes for his pleasures and ours. The two laddies promise entertainment, makes us realize our voyeurism and keep their part of the deal by delaying death, by playing hide and seek, by giving a chance to their kill to participate to escape and sustain us on our seats by giving us hope before 90 minutes are over. Haneke increases the viewers level of involvement by breaking the fourth wall and thinning the line between reality and fiction, reversing the sequence we wanted, deploying false escape device to question our intelligence, freezing the frame from a distance and not giving close-up shots of the protagonists and thus making us think about what we are watching, what we expected and what we want next to happen.",Funny Games
189,sebbastiann,Shockingly Intelligent!...A Critique of the Bourgeoisie at its Best!,10,23 December 2004,"""Funny Games"" is the rare kind of picture one could watch even in the 22nd century! This film is Bunuel's macabre satire ""Le charm discret de la Bourgeoisie"" turned into a horror!I was shocked and outraged the first time I saw it, fascinated and mesmerized the second time and every time I watch it I never cease to find surprising elements that bother my mind and challenge my imagination!First of all I was surprised to see that a lot of people saw in this picture just a very convincing anti-violence manifest! This ""cat and mouse"" film/game embodies the ruthless critique of a social class that ceases to ACT OR THINK and eventually loses its instinct of preservation.I found it to be no critique of a certain society: American, Canadian or Western European but the critique of the bourgeoisie which lives within each and every individual and ultimately the critique of the Modern Man (No Hero, No Villain but a passive element part of a system).Secondly I was also puzzled to find out that many people considered the interaction actor/viewer to be a shortcoming and eventually spoiled their pleasure to live the drama of the 3 victims.Well...as long as we accept the film to be a metaphor with no real vivid characters I see no reason why we shouldn't accept this convention too!We are given a CONVENTION and we accept it.It's the same in theater: we know that not a real drama unfolds in front of our eyes on the stage but a re-enactment with some characters; nevertheless we still experience different emotions: we cry we laugh...in one word we accept the illusion!!Not a film for everyone!

You can kill the son, or the father or the mother instantly. Or you can play with them in long-term. Communication with the outer world isn't possible. Rules are given by two psychopaths who are committed themselves to the psychopath tendencies of their own. And they see what they do as a game which results in persecution of a family. You can struggle to find a better end for this family, but NO. Everything is evil.You must have guts to watch it, because you can't change what you're witnessing as an audience. What you can do is only watch it helplessly.The movie tells about the irony that lies in the fact that things these two have done aren't funny at all, but considered to be a part of a ""funny game"".(which is very obvious) Be gentle to the strangers in your house!

In Funny games, there's no explanation, just cruelty and no way to survive. You know it and that's what it's so difficult to ""enjoy"" that movie.

It would have made a great short movie of 20min though! Funny Games lacks in subtlety to really make it captivating and mind twisting.

Mr. Haneke, you call this an ""Anti-Hollywood-Violence-Movie"". What bad Hollywood movies are you referring to? At least ""Hollywood"" movies tend to have a story which you lack. The pure violence you show is of course consuming the shocked audience with the desire of some kind of redemption. That's nothing special at all. Neither is your lack of statement.

Anna pleasantly gives him the eggs, but Peter accidentally drops them on the floor and asks for more. Eventually Paul arrives at the house and because of their resistance to leave, Anna starts feeling nervous and tells the boys to go away.When Georg and their son arrive, Georg also insists that they should go and there's when the mind games began. Georg is hit with a golf club in his leg and the family is imprisoned in their own house. Peter and Paul play sadistic games with the victims, creating a true atmosphere of panic which is very well portrayed by the actors.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's not fast-paced at all - most of the scenes are super slow and the whole interaction between the characters made me feel uncomfortable.

One does not have to like this film, but every one who knows Hanneke's work knows that he is not going for simple shock effects to attract a big audience.

The behavior of the characters in the film is only believable for the first few minutes. As the film progresses, it becomes obvious that there will be no end to the depravity of the home invaders and the fact that the victims can't see this is inexplicable.

The critique of violence in media today is fair, although Haneke fails to acknowledge what role he himself is acting in this problem.Funny Games has become an absolute hit in it's genre and has assumingly grown to be more popular than he'd first predicted. Mental, physical, really any form of terror you could imagine, is what this film is bathed in. Hanake is proving a point, that violence in media to day is excessive - that said Hanake is really just pouring gasoline on the bonfire.A fair bunch of 'Funny Games lovers' (they're bound to exist somewhere) will claim that i don't understand what Funny Games is about - i believe i do - but then again how can i know that i do for sure... I believe that the film in general is misunderstood to be sophisticated when it really is just spoon feeding it's audience with a fairly simple message - wrapped up in some of the most intolerable suffering you as a film lover have had to endure. The cult status of this awful movie forces poor souls like myself to watch it, all just for this review to be justified.I marked it as containing spoilers, because people who really don't know what they're going to watch when they pick up Funny Games, will think it's a fairly pleasant setting as the movie proceeds through it's short introduction..... From where the agony begins - or should i say ""games begin"".1/10 - disgusting movie, nothing less, NOTHING more.

Funny Games is consistent throughout, keeping the viewer terribly uncomfortable watching a typical family at the mercy of two uninvited young men.  This movie is for the people who normally leave movies saying, ""Why didn't the bad guy just KILL them?""

In the strong light of reality offered by Haneke, the Hollywood ""perspective"" on violence becomes not only boring, but downright immoral.This is what violence really is: unpredictable, extreme, sordid, pointless, and tragically relevant. It is interesting to note that the film is hardly gory---more attention is given to violence's physical and psychological aftermath on the victims, which are sadly given little notice by Hollywood. As we can see from previous comments, the victims' powerlessness inspires violence in some, and anger (towards the director) in others. Haneke refuses to give the audience any relief---no cavalry charging against the bad guys, nor payoff for the good. That's why he's so hated by so many. But I hope that some can still see  his uncompromising honesty. Haneke is the greatest realistic moralist now working in world cinema.  I have the feeling of having my hair relentlessly pulled back when the violence gets too much to watch. Who ever says that violence is just???I feel that after this experience, I can no longer talk about violence with the glibness that so many others still try so hard to hang on to.9 out of 10.",Funny Games

This theme has been explored before (e.g. Natural Born Killers). ""Violence that is shocking because it is devoid of emotion"". Hmmm,Truman Capote wrote something called ""In Cold Blood"" forty years ago and THAT film as well as the real event that inspired it were shocking. (Now more so because it ironically starred one Robert Blake.) But praising Haneke as a cinema ""god""? Give me a break. Haneke's background is in theater and TV, and it shows. This is little more than a one act, one idea play. Sure it plays on our innate curiosity. They aren't going to do that ...oops, I guess they are. But not...oops, wrong again. Character development, movement? Non-existent. Plot idea: two men wearing surgical gloves enter home and terrorize family. Does family survive? Stay tuned. Moral: Don't let rubber-gloved young men into your house. Sure, you'll watch it just to see how it ends, but please don't tell me that this movie depicts deep philosophical questions about media or morality any more than a video game does.As for terror, Haneke has just taken a lesson from Hitchcock or Lynch (Blue Velvet) who have shown that it often works best in seemingly nice circumstances when it is unexpected and therefore unsettling.And as for the character winking at us, I think that is just because the joke is on us for having watched. This is a heavy-handed exploitation film that titillates the senses. The '70s brought us black exploitation films and it looks like this decade is bringing us the ""media glorifies violence and since we watch, we're guilty too"" films.

The film is shocking and I think that an American version of this film needs to be made. The biggest problem with the movie is it recognizes itself as a film by interacting with the audience. However ""cute"" that may be it does bring the viewer to remember that constantly so in my opinion it is not quite as effective versus non interaction.

I happened to see it a few years ago ( before the remake was made) when I rented it at the local video shop. I had only heard that it was extremely violent and scary. The hearsay was right. Two psychotic teenagers who are very clean and well groomed take a couple and their son hostage and play nearly unviewable sadistic games with them that come off as all too real. At one point when the woman escapes, you think there could be hope but then she is recaptured and tortured more. This film is so disturbing because it is directed almost like a snuff movie. It has nothing to do with other more funny horror movies in the genre, there's no humor and no redeeming qualities to make it bearable to watch. It made me feel queasy and sick, like it has to so many other viewers, it was that real. The only thing that bothered me is that movie is in German and the subtitles were distracting.",Funny Games

Through its off screen violence and gore, it outdoes the most in your face schlock-fest. Its an indictment of violence in our everyday media and lives through perpetrating violence, almost with A Clockwork Orange appeal. The responses of the actors are realistic, the plot believable.

213,jonahwp,Unexpected Gem,8,7 July 2018,"While was unaware of Funny Games prior to watching it over 20 years after its release, I am not disappointed that I chose to view Michael Haneke's psychological thriller.A number of factors sold this film to me as one of the better thrillers that I have seen in a while. The most notable of these factors are Ulrich Mühe (Georg) and Susanne Lothar's (Anna) performances. Both of these actors displayed their devastation brilliantly and stayed on the proper side of the fine line between an upset character and an annoying character. Never did the emotions of these two characters get on my nerves or give me a headache, so coo-dos to that. At points, however, I did feel as if these two characters were not reacting realistically to a specific event that occurred in the second act of the film (which I shall not get into because it is a spoiler... oh no). Additionally, I believe that Haneke's choice to not show much of the violence actually take place on camera was wise. Haneke's message behind this movie was to highlight the dark nature behind violence, a subject which is often exploited and glorified in movies. Funny Games does not treat the viewer to a video of a shotgun exploding a guy's head that makes the audience turn in disgust. Instead, the film focuses on the emotions that violence causes and the darkness that it brings to the lives of many. It was the deterioration of the film's protagonists that was caused by violence that I found truly disturbing.Finally, (I felt the need to comment on this as it is often brought up in forums about this film) there is a certain character in that breaks the fourth wall. Does this work for the movie? Sort of. I believe that it worked well at times to provide relief from the heavy load of this film. However, I felt as though this character often removed from the realistic and captivating features of this film when he spoke directly to the audience. Overall, Funny Games is a hidden gem that will not make you shut your eyes due to the blood and gore on the screen, but disturb you in a different way. It will make you stay up the night and think about the themes and messages that you observed. It will make you question the true nature of violence and (perhaps) look down upon certain films that glorify it. While Funny Games is not without its issues, it is an above average psychological thriller that I would recommend. Rate: 8.4/10",Funny Games
214,trovster,Unconventionally Brilliant,9,14 January 2008,"Funny Games is an unconventional thriller by German writer and director Michael Haneke. The movie follows a mother, father and son vacationing at their lake house when they're interrupted and held hostage by two psychotic young men.The hostage-takers are strangely sedate in their brutal treatment of the family. The horror of the situation is heightened to epic proportions with Haneke's brilliant direction. You do not see any of the violence; instead, you see the horrible reality. The extremely long shots, the lack of music and the harsh factuality of the scenes make this movie brilliant.Haneke breaks the ""fourth wall"" at least twice during this movie. As one character looks and talks directly to the camera and the audience. Another breathtaking scene is a single take which lasts over ten minutes.These types of directorial choices are far from those which are found in typical Hollywood movies. Haneke purposefully uses non-glamorous portrayals of violence in a direct opposition to Taraninto-style movies and because of this, I think the movie is brilliant - highly recommended.",Funny Games
215,GeeWillickersRadioactiveMan,You've Seen It Before...,1,22 October 2019,"In the sense that I am going to make similar criticisms to other viewers, and that this movie has nothing to say which hasn't been said better before it.I'm not educated on cinema like some of the other reviewers here, I can't reference esoteric French films. I can however reference a reviled French writer, Marquis De Sade. This is the same man whose name is literally referenced by the word ""sadism"".I consider Funny Games to be an inadvertent 100 Days of Sodom. Where De Sade was fantasizing about continuing his cruelty while wasting away in a bastille (some have argued this is a vague deconstruction of the cruelty and hypocrisy of the French ruling class at the time, which seems abundantly generous), Haneke created a film to disparage his audience. I compare to Haneke to De Sade, not because I think he has nearly as horrible machinations, but the contents of his film is equally useless and unredeeming as De Sade's novel about violent pedophilia.Haneke believes that people who wouldn't finish this film, ""don't need to watch it"". While this paraphrase may be a little exaggerated, I can't remember his exact comments. He indeed made this film to completion. Then marketed it. Then profited from it (I assume, the returns weren't immediately available in my searching which seems unusual by itself, again I'm no film expert).He has undermined his own thesis in his very action. This comes through in the half-baked puritanism which underlies this film. It yearns to chastise the audience in partaking in it, but never once applies the same criticism to itself. Ultimately, this film proves to be an entirely useless endeavor, making the finale more poignant than the writing seems to have actually intended.While we can see that a character like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho finally resigns to the unreal nature of his privilege, making the violence both moot and poignant, we see no such meaningful conclusion here. Instead, the viewer is left to ponder their own responsibility in worldwide violence. Which makes me wonder if Haneke thinks that violence in video games and movies causes violence in real life? If we're adult enough to recognize the morality of this film immediately, so that we choose not to watch, surely we're mature enough to tell the difference between fiction and reality?I think the most telling aspect of the hypocrisy of this film is that he remade it, and for no plausible reason other than, ""people need to see it again"". This was his rationale as far as I can remember. The only thing propping up this exploitation film is the attempts at art house pseudo-intellectualism. Otherwise, I think it would be roundly eviscerated for being entirely soulless and horrible. Maybe the thing Haneke should be investigating through cinema is our own self-aggrandizing nature, and the desire to call ourselves ""deep"", ""smart"", and ""moral""? Of course, that would require he include himself in that same group, but judging by this film, that would never happen.",Funny Games

220,deus1789,Two realities put into one,10,24 February 2008,"Mr Haneke seems to love observing family member characters dealing with extreme situations. On one hand we have a typical family which one could call civilized, and on the other hand two young violent sadists. The two worlds are opposed to each other, but then in reality they meet everyday in every part of the world. Their difference is the difference of classical music and black metal (both musical styles can be listened in this movie)...But yet, what is the difference of a normal humorous pretty bomber pilot with Paul and Fatty? They both guarantee a fatal sadistic without hope end. Maybe some people have these realities inside them too. Yet Mr Haneke did not present the beauty of violence as Hollywood movies would (mainstream or Tarantino), nor he directed an hymn to violence as it is clearly seen in ""Clockwork orange"". The ""normal"" watcher sympathizes the normal family. On the contrary in real life situation, maybe reading through a newspaper or watching TV, he would feel sympathy for them for 5 minutes. The power of ""evil"" is presented unquestionable. No hope can survive, even time rewinds and cannot beat the violent (re)actions of these young monsters. The personalities of Paul and Fatty are very interesting as in the end they express some questionable pseydophilosophies. What's their difference again with Nazis and current aggressive wars? Maybe this is a reference to Chaplin's ""Monsieur Verdoux""... The movie can also be seen through the ""shocking effect"" theory. We question the strength of the family especially father’s protectiveness, but we miss the point that in reality people with normal lifes become easily victims, one can say they are conformists. The shock is less intense for a person who lives an abnormal life and is ready to protest against violence... The actors perform excellently. One must be ready for a ""disturbing"" movie no happy end, no cheap Hollywood violin music, no Deus ex machina, but as it was written above this is an every day incident...We cannot expect from people who are hypnotized all their lifes by ""happy endings and superheroes"" to credit this movie.",Funny Games

The central character (who was suitably unpleasant) invited us to witness increasingly unpleasant acts, but if the film was meant to educate or reveal as to why we watch this it didn't, or was too subtle for me. I perhaps wasn't interested enough, as the theme that drew me to watching this film didn't outweigh it's flatness and dullness. If it simply meant to open the debate, fair enough. Can someone please enlighten me if I've missed something, although whatever I may have missed doesn't alter the fact that this is a dull film, for all it's violence.",Funny Games
222,ajcox67uk,"Chilling, disturbing but disingenuous",6,30 July 2010,"'Funny Games' is certainly not a pleasant film to watch. As the title implies, this film is about Michael Haneke playing games with the audience rather than simply telling a story and this artistic strategy is borne out in the interview added on to the latest DVD edition.I don't want to give too much away, so I'll comment on the interview with the director. Haneke takes a rather mocking view of the audience by chastising viewers who would object to his film yet stay to watch the end of it; he implies they are perhaps sick for doing so. He also says that the scene where the female hostage shoots one of the torturers, caused many people at cinema screenings to clap with relief, only for them to fall into silence when the scene is rewound like a videotape and the woman is returned back to her terrible predicament. Haneke says that they were applauding murder by cheering the woman's actions. In essence they were not. Her actions were not an act of murder but of desperate self-defence, but, hey, this is only a film. However, Haneke seems to think that screen violence is the flip side of real violence. To the director the audience's reactions to the shooting are more than a reaction to a narrative, but a condonation of an act of 'murder', which it is not. The woman's actions can be judged as justifiable self-defence whether as part of a narrative or real life itself.Haneke vainly congratulates himself for 'manipulating' the audience with this scene. However, this suggestion of manipulation is rather pompous of Haneke, as almost all films, in fact all forms of storytelling, manipulate the audience; it is part of the cathartic pleasure of watching a film and what makes cinema such a uniquely rich and rewarding experience, but this 'manipulation' ends the minute a film is over. We are perfectly capable of emotionally and intellectually distinguishing between a depiction of fictional violence and the real thing itself, and I think Haneke is mistaken to believe otherwise. This is a film everyone should watch or attempt to watch (it certainly isn't pleasant viewing), but I would take Haneke's thesis interlinking screen and real violence with a strong pinch of salt.",Funny Games
223,nachtzoen,Reviewer from Finland 100% on the mark,10,16 January 2005,"The previous comments by Mika from Finland are right on the mark, I don't see how anyone could describe this film better. I saw it a couple of years ago and the violence in it still haunts me. It's the kind of movie that once you see it you'll never forget it. It was extremely well done and kept me on the edge of my seat. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in their teens, no matter how many R rated movies they've watched, this film is not at all like the usual blood, gore and murder you see daily on TV. Despite being only a movie, the difference is nearly like the difference between seeing a movie death or car wreck and one in real life. It leaves you with the same sort of sense of horror that makes you feel drained and vulnerable. I'm glad it's only a movie. But like the other reviewer, I don't know who to recommend it to. I rented it and happened to watch it late at night then decided to return it before my husband could sit and watch it, not even wanting to subject a grown man to a movie like this. There's plenty of movies out there with sick and perverted violence, usually gory ones, but this movie is intelligent, understated and well made which makes the horror vastly more chilling.

Is the film a critique to this genre or merely a new addition?Ultimately flawed but interesting and deserves a viewing. The acting was good, contrary to some earlier comments and the production values were quite decent.",Funny Games
226,japs,Muddled Dialectic,6,4 June 2006,"Funny Games was certainly thought-provoking. Haneke seems to have enough knowledge of film to infuse this movie (and most of his films to be honest) with a whole range of plays on established conventions within the thriller genre. And these on the whole worked quite well. I found the intellectual argument he puts forward less convincing though.It appears his view is that we are all advocates of violence. The 'rewind' scene sets up the conventional retribution that normally proceeds the kidnap and torture sequences (see Straw Dogs etc). He doesn't allow us that outlet however, although he draws attention to it, thereby allowing us to examine that desire further. And the conclusion, one can draw. Yes, we call for acts of wanton violence to be administered upon arbiters of violent acts. There is a further link, I feel, he is trying to make from this position and that is this desire to see violence administered is somehow responsible for the violent world we live in. (There is, of course, another line of argument running through the film about the true visceral nature of violence but that's for another post)I don't feel this is credible however. When a cinema audience calls for blood in a movie, I feel it is from a position of being completely aware that the narrative they are viewing is an artifice. People aren't going to be really killed. Hence, they can observe the violence being carried out in a 'comic' manner (bad guys getting shot in Westerns without a bullet hole appearing etc) and not have their disbelief in the fantasy world of the film suspended. This isn't misleading I feel, and doesn't inure people to the reality of how brutal and ugly real violence is. After all if one takes that approach then one can argue that Tom and Jerry cartoons suffer from the same problem. I think where he may have a point, is in the manipulation of actual real-life events to make them less unsettling to an audience. I'm thinking of the Western news reports of Iraq, where disturbing footage of atrocities are cut so the Western viewer doesn't become upset or disturbed about what they're watching. This DOES desensitise the viewer to what war is about because the fact/fiction boundary has been crossed and we can't fall back on the intellectual safety nets I talked about earlier. And why is that a bad thing? Because our government is committing these acts and we have a duty to see the full horror of what they are doing in our name. Any thoughts?",Funny Games

233,anonymous_whisper,The whole movie is a TEST on the viewer. ***SPOILERS****,10,29 January 2005,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! Most people would agree that this movie was completely bleak, ugly, violent, depressing, and scary. This is my theory on the movie: I think the point of it was not to show us something about the characters or the plot but about ourselves, the audience.Paul, the sadistic psycho, addresses the viewer at several points in the movie. The first being when he is playing the ""hot-and-cold"" game with Anna as she is looking for the dead dog. He winks directly in the camera, almost to say as if, ""Hey you're watching this movie, you're in on this senseless violence"".Then later on he says to the camera ""What do you think? Do you think they have a chance of winning? You are on their side aren't you?"" which is another challenge to the audience. Of course we are on the families side (or are we?), who all seem like basically good people...yet we continue to watch them humiliated and degraded in such an inhumane way. Why? Maybe because we think they will escape and the bad guys will end up losing? That seems fair.The next challenge comes when Anna refuses to play the game, and Paul says ""Huh, that's cowardly! We're not up to feature film length yet."" He looks directly in the camera and say, ""Is that enough? But you want a real ending, with plausible plot developments, don't you?"" Here I think he is chiding the viewer...why are we still watching is pretty much what he asks? These parents just saw their child murdered and have been put through hell - aren't we disgusted with this movie enough to turn it off. He basically gives us a pass though by saying perhaps we'll have a 'real ending', a relatively happy ending and that's why we continue to watch.Well, that is all shot to hell when Anna grabs the gun and shoots Peter. Finally, one of the bad guy got his, will the other? The family might be saved after all! But no, Paul rewinds the movie to before Anna shoots Peter and he stops it from happening. After all Paul is in charge of the game on the viewer, he wants to see how much we can take..and now we KNOW there will not be a happy ending because Paul is in charge of the movie, and Paul, as we know, is a SICK FREAK! Yet we continue to watch, to see what we know will happen, and it does. Anna is killed, dumped off a boat while she's tied up. There's no way Anna can be saved because she is not in control of the game...Paul is.The last interaction Paul has with the camera is at the very end when he goes to the neighbor's house to borrow eggs and we the viewer knows it's happening all over again, and another family is going to be butchered. The very last shot is a chilling look Paul gives the camera, which to me said, ""Gotcha, you watched to the very end."" and he has a small smile on his face.So I think the whole movie was actually a game on the viewer, to see how much he/she can take, how much ugliness and violence and hopelessness we can muster before turning the movie off. Those that make it to the end have to ask, ""Why did we continue to watch?"" Especially once we know Paul controls the movie, the ""game"", and that it will only be more violence. Do we get some sort of pleasure from this ""sadistic voyeurism""? And if so, are we that much different than Paul and Peter? That is what I think...the movie's purpose is basically to make us question ourselves and our own basic humanity. On that level I think it very much succeeds. Scary and brilliant. 10/10",Funny Games

This movie was a response by Haneke to criticism that his earlier films were too violent; his intent is to make the audience squirm by portraying the true nature of violence - trumping his critics. Haneke says that the proper response to the violence in this movie should be to ""leave the theater,"" but few do.This 1997 Austrian version is the original and it was followed in 2007 by a scene-by-scene remake set in America. Both versions are excellent but I would encourage you to watch the original Austrian version first (be sure to check out the interview with Haneke in the DVD-extras). Both versions are well-cast and the score is truly inspirational. There are quite a few fun and unexpected twists; the movie does have a sense of humor, but my what dark humor it is!One final note - this can be an uncomfortable movie to watch with friends.

For those of us who managed to sit through this psychic skewering, the answer couldn't be simpler. Confrontation with fear, be it realistic or fantastic, brings our mortality out of its protective sheath. This film shoves it in our faces and manipulates our expectations with the use of more or less brilliant techniques. It doesn't take a full-fledged masochist to want to jump the white-picket fence every so often.Peter and Paul, the innocent looking antagonists, emerge as tormenters without the intensity of David Lynch's monsters like Frank Booth. They are perhaps therefore even more effective in scaring the hell out of us. In a way they reminded me of some of Ingmar Bergman's on-screen incarnations of evil, especially from the Seventh Seal and the Virgin Spring.A naive bourgeois family is brought into the world of Beavis&Butthead and Tom&Jerry (P&P's pet names for each other) minus the invulnerability. Excellent acting makes the callousness of the psychos and the helplessness of their victims believable. All viewers ask themselves how they would react in such a situation and few of us know. But I would like to believe director/writer Haneke's version is sadly true. If you read Philip Gourevitch's take on the Rwandan genocide you can begin to see why. As for this film's contribution to the world of violence we live in...well, it may be a comment on that vidiots and tube zombies spend their lives unable to distinguish between CNN's ""The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated"" and Itchy&Scratchy, but in the end it's surely an indictment of the former.

(<- sorry about being vulgar, but people who have seen the movie may understand)The point Haneke tries to make is ""I'm showing you all these terrible things, and it's you who wants all that to happen, right...?"" - an attempt at making the audience become the villain, to expose all the sadistic and fascistic tendencies in us that supposedly made something like the 3rd Reich possible - so that we shall be accused. In many ways this movie is a sibling to Pasolinis ""Salo"", only this time it is not about fascist society but about violence in the media.Haneke denies the viewer any resolution or retribution after the thrill. Relentlessly, we are tortured with violent, nihilist and aggressive messages going beyond all that is morally or humanely acceptable, not stopping for the psyche of 9-year old children, delicate religious feelings, etc., it only tries to steal your soul, and it only ever gets worse.Fans of the ""genre"" you may attribute to this movie will doubtlessly find the movie a real snoozer though, and I strongly doubt these possibly addressed recipients of the films undercurrent moralist message will get the point of it all - I bet it must in fact be a pretty boring movie for fans of ""The last house on the left"", instead of an enlightening one. All other viewers will be annoyed and appalled by this movie though. For all the obvious in- and pretensions, Hanekes imagination of human behavior is strangely limited - e.g. the behavior of the family in its mode of continued silent suffering seems quite unrealistic to me. I couldn't share the fascination with the latex-gloved sadism of these god-like everyday killers, which rather seem to carry some significance about Haneke's own fantasies.There is no way to stop the killers in the movie, we just watch everyone going through more and more pain and finally die, so the only way for the movie audience to get through this movie alive is to masochistically fall in love with at least one of the bad guys (the alpha-male-intellectual-smirk-in-the-camera one who is so godlike that he can even rewind the film when something doesn't go as planned).Haneke is not doing magic though but rather doing violence to his viewers, making quite a few incorrect assumptions along the way about our (the viewers) inner state - e.g. when the killers return, I had no desire for them at all, even though it was claimed this would be the moment Haneke proves his point (that we'd supposedly want it to continue).I somehow didn't get the secret joys I was supposed to feel - I could have also just walked out - all I did during the movie was accumulating aggressions against the two killers, which in the end more and more turned against the film maker. What's the point of all this?Haneke here beats down his audience in every way he can like a violent abusive kidnapper - thereby claiming the same kind of god-likeness and submissive love that he forces upon the audience for the killers. It's the typical claim of the magician-like 19th century artist persona to a position of unquestionable power surrounded by a totally impressed blown away awe induced audience, but sorry, I won't play along with your claim to fame here, Mr Haneke.This movie is a typical Austrian sadist artist's excrement.

The unpredictability and consequence of this movie is the reason why I like it. If you haven't seen this movie, watch it and do not read any further!!! Two unusual guys walk in a house of a family an kill all of them. That's sounds not to be a unusual or surprising plot but it is. We as the audience, are used to see and desire that the good side wins against the dark side. But after thousands of movies with this idea some people might get tired of that crap. So, when suddenly a movie has no hero and the bad guys just kill the good ones, I am happy. Like in the movie 'Dogville', I was afraid the end is about 'fogive and forget', but it's about anger and revenge. I think that this is more authentic in our real world. That's why I like Funny Games, it's authentic. When two crazy guys walk in your house, they kill you. You not gonna, take a knife and kill them both with karate moves or somewhat. No, that's only in movies ;-) Funny Games is a good piece of work. I think that this movie is not disgusting like many people say. It just shows how it would be in real life if two crazy guys walk by. Other horror movies are disgusting because people spend hours of thinking about how to kill somebody in different ways. Funny Games, however, just plays with your mind and you are disappointed because the woman didn't make it :-) The motive of killing is unclear, maybe its because of fun, hence the title 'funny games', or something more plausible.

Watch Funny Games.Or, on the contrary, are you frightened by the banalisation of violence in nowadays' films ? Watch Funny Games. Do you think you are not easily influentiable and manipulable ? Watch Funny Games. Do you want to realise how defenseless our society is without its numerous social codes ? Watch Funny Games.The list could keep gaining in length endlessly ... ! Funny Games is a brilliant and shocking movie, because it reveals to us relentlessly the bestial, primitive, uncontrollable and therefore disturbing side of humanity we'd (consciously) rather not see.Whereas the vast majority of films show violence in a heroic, almost sublime, and deeply hypocritical way, Funny Games makes us fully conscious of what we really applaud in theatres everyday : the two handsome and polite young slaughterers blinking at the spectators (which become involved actors), constantly laying the blame on the family and its deeds, remind us that violence is neither about glory, nor justice, nor joy : it is about pain, humiliation and despair. Funny Games' message is clear : enjoying violence (and therefore becoming its complicit, just as the dreadful tandem makes us feel) is about pure and simple dehumanisation (""emotional glaciation"" as M. Haneke names it).Moreover, another side of Funny Games is the way it depicts the deep weakness of the occidental human : easily intimidated in the presence of predators, which break all kind of social barrier and codes (notice the almost non-existent distance between the two young men and the father during their first ""chat""), it becomes quickly helpless, ""drowned"" in the absence of these social codes, which are its only true ""marks"" when facing other people.Being forced to see what we don't want to see is all but a delightful experience : thus is Funny Games ! This can explain the violent reactions to this movie : as Haneke says, a punch in the face often triggers analogous reactions ! Therefore, do not expect to experience any real fun with Funny Games (ironically) :) Let rather yourself get imprisoned in the two killer's vortex of inhumanity for the time of the film, and admire the disturbing human bestiality in full scale !",Funny Games

Judge by the attitudes of kids who think knocking people out and filming it for Youtube are entertaining after being entertained by the violence-porn industry.

252,timothydean74,Minus Infinite Stars Burning Eternally In Hell,1,29 July 2006,"There are certain films that use extreme violence to paradoxically sensitize us to the effects and causes, as well as the ugliness, of violence. Then there are films that use the above as an excuse to indulge in violence simply to satisfy a perverse lust for sadistic self-gratification. This film falls into the latter category.Actually, this film is in a league all it's own. Imagine what a film made by young Nazi hipsters who get their kicks out of torturing and murdering Jews would look like. Then multiply that by 100 times. You'd be somewhere near the sickening moral black hole this pretentious ""film"" is. Unlike most IMDb users, I reserve 1's for movies that are beyond bad and into truly diabolical. So it is extremely rare that I give out a one. But there is no number you can put to how revolting this movie is. It literally made me sick for days and plunged me into a severe depression. And that's from someone who thinks Natural Born Killers is a masterpiece. This movie took a part of my soul away. It is a nihilistic ""f**k all, but look how cool we are in doing it"" masturbation-fest. Oh, but don't you get it?

I shall not comment the story in detail, you guys have done that already. I just want to tell those who dislike the movie why I think its a good and important film.Haneke doesn't basically want to entertain us, but rather make us ask ourself why we watch violent movies and if we really enjoy it, and why? For me this movie was a turning point. Violence in movies could never be seen in the same way after this.I tough that I was hard and had seen it all in movies and that nothing could affect me. Well, Haneke proved me wrong. I saw this movie at home together with my ex, the absence of music and direct violence was extremely effective. When the movie ended neither me or my ex said anything, we just stood from the couch and walked like zombies to the bedroom. No words where exchanged we just went to bed trying to sleep. For my sake I couldn't, I had to many things on my mind and all of my body where aching.10 out of 10",Funny Games
254,worst-nightmare13,Peter & Paul are two of the deadliest additions to the long chain of serial killers!,8,17 October 2012,"I must be insane to call this film great. But then again, I must be insane not to call this film great. Funny Games, directed by Michael Haneke, is a prime example of a great psychological, or the appropriate term would be mindf***, horror of high intense. Anyway, Funny Games plays like an episode of Big Brother gone wrong. And, in order to prevent losing their precious viewers, the director kept rolling, showing the world the sadistic nature of Peter and Paul (who affectionately call each other Tom & Jerry and Beavis & Butthead). But you see, it's precisely the all-too-real feel to it that makes this film unique and different from its peers. That, and the performances by the main five cast members. Basically, the film is not for the faint-hearted or weak-minded people. But it's not for horror fans either. It's mostly for thinkers. If you can understand what the hell happened by the end of the film, you will have known that you were the intended audience and not some half-baked ass wanting a cheap thrill. That came off harsh, didn't it?You know the killers are cold-hearted when they kill in pairs. When they're alone, the killer is scary, yes, but he is limited. But when he has friends, the brutality seems to have no end to it. Google 3 Guys 1 Hammer and you will understand. Here we have Peter & Paul terrorizing a family. They're worse than hack 'n slash killers because they kill slowly and calmly, as if it's their profession, which, by the looks of it, could be. Not only they were well written for the screen, but they were so well acted that it's a wonder those two didn't become well-known actors. Arno Frisch plays Paul, the leader of the two, and the most talkative. His performance was the best from the film and very professional. He so fully embodied the character that the effect was uncharacteristically convincing. The performance is a must-watch. His buddy, Peter, is played by Frank Giering, widely considered to be his breakout performance, a statement I must agree with. Even though he became his character only 90%, the overall effect was damn scary because Frank looked, acted and talked like a true, no-bullshit serial killer. And seeing that was great. I forgot to mention, they have a third member, and that third member is YOU! (if you watch the film, you will understand!). From the family, Ulrich Muhe as Georg was also brilliant. He had his character in check from the start, but it was Susanne Lothar as Anna that impressed me the most. One of the damn best performances from the horror genre. It was terribly awesome! The little kid was good, too, you know, with his terrified expressions and watery eyes!Great performances in horror films are very rare, take it from me, I know. They're either one-sided or gain pace somewhere near the end. But you won't find any of that in this one. It looks and feels genuine. Authentic. Real. As real as if they're ""live"" actors in a very long snuff film. You won't be disappointed, I promise.In conclusion, Funny Games is controversial and seriously not for yellow tummies. If you're tired of watching the same old kills in every horror movie, then the uniqueness in this film should be a good surprise!",Funny Games

It's one of those movies which really gets you thinking, on the contrary to Hollywood movies.The movie is about two young men taking a family prisoners in their own house and forcing them to play sadistic games with each others.

259,JonsKlaessens,-2 Points for Showing Contempt for Your Audience,8,9 June 2018,"Anyone who has ever seen a Michael Haneke film will know he can provide a near to perfect, yet challenging piece of cinema and Funny Games is perhaps just a close to perfection like any of the other films which he made that I have seen. You will not hear me complain about the fantastic acting, cinematography, pacing, editing et cetera et cetera. The reason why Funny Games does not receive a ten star rating like Caché, Das Weisse Band or Amour did, is because of Haneke's intention for making it. He made this film where two sadistic young men capture and torture an upper-middle class family because he wanted to make the audience aware of the fact that we enjoy this types of cruel movies. This cruel film is an essay, stating that audiences revel in the torture of innocent fictional characters. And from what I could glean from the actual essay he wrote on the film, there is also some commentary in there about the role of violent media in a violent society, but I will not follow him down that rabbit hole just yet. Let's for now stick with his primary message. I will never deny that audiences don't enjoy violent or even cruel movies. I myself am an enormous fan of all kinds of horror, be it slocky gore fests or serious suspense filled dramatic thrillers. Funny Games is not a horror movie. It is an art film, wearing the mask of a horror film, which it pulls of halfway through, so it can accuse us of enjoying the sick imagery on screen. Through the various fourth-wall breaks the killers interact with us, asking for our opinion and approval, as to say that we are the ones causing all this. We are not Mr. Haneke. Nobody forced you to make a horror film. Just like nobody is going to force me to like your pretentious accusations. And note that when I use the word pretentious I am not referring to the filmmaking, but to the intention of the filmmaker. Funny Games is an expertly crafted insult to the audience for liking a genre of movies the director does not. The film could have been great, but its downfall lays in the fact that it thinks it is better than its colleagues. Now if you will excuse me, I am going to watch a dumb, gory horror flick, and enjoy myself.",Funny Games

Based on the movie's controversial status, I went into it thinking I would either love it or hate it. Well, I didn't love it but I definitely didn't hate it. The direction is confident and creative-which is what I expect from Michael Haneke-, although the writing doesn't feel as subtle, as masterful, or as mature as the writing from Haneke's other movies that I've seen so far (Caché, The White Ribbon, Amour), which are all 10/10.
Overall the film was a very interesting experience, and surprising too, even though some parts felt too violent and ""disconnected"" me from the film, if only for a few minutes.

261,k-konni,"very tough to take, but well made and acted even if it is as a whole not entirely convincing",7,9 July 2006,"Michael Hanekes Funny Games is basically a thriller who wants to be much more because it wants to show YOU, the audience that you take violence in the movies for granted. The premise is not exactly new or original: family takes a vacation and wants to relax in their house next to a big beautiful lake where they are held hostages by a pair of seriously disturbed psychos. The difference between this thriller and hundred others can be found in certain scenes like the one where one character winks at the audience and another one where he actually asks us on which side we are and if we want to bet who is going to be alive the next morning. In this way he makes the audience part of the game. There is hardly any gore in the movie but that doesn't mean there is no violence in it as some try tom make you believe. The two psychos who call themselves by various names throughout the movie show no sign of any humanity and they talk like any stereotypical Hollywood villain and i think thats why the movie doesn't quite live up to its expectations. If they talked like regular people the effect on the audience would be much more powerful, instead one can't be entirely shocked because you are always aware that you are watching a movie. The acting in this movie is on a very high level - Lothar and Mühe are extraordinary good as the victims and Frisch who worked with haneke before in Bennys Video (a more effective movie in my opinion) and Giering make a very chilling team. I mentioned before that one cannot be entirely shocked because of the way these people talk to each other but some images are another matter. The disturbed faces of the victims and their desperate attempts to escape who are finally to no avail will haunt you even days days afterwards. The most effective scene comes near the end when on of the gangsters is shot and the other one rewinds the scene with the remote control. It's an original idea and the scene develops in a very surprising manner. All in all the movie is certainly ambitious and occasionally quite powerful but finally in its criticism of the audience and their respond to violence not a hundred-percent convincing.",Funny Games

It only consists on easy torture, just a false snuff movie with terrible actors and less quality than a lot of porn films. There are no gore scenes in it, but it would have been a much more sincere film if there were some. It is a movie made according to the tastes of some sick high-class European bourgeoisie which dare not watch porn or gore films; nevertheless, they do like this film, because it is awfully sensationalist and morbid but it doesn't make them feel guilty for watching it, as it is supposed to be art.",Funny Games
265,blueseyed,The Banality of Evil,10,11 April 2006,"I suggest everyone to read at least one of the following books before watching this movie: C. R.

Scarry, The Body in Pain. The Making and Unmaking of the World, New York, Oxford U. P., 1985.I recommend also this famous article (even a movie was taken out of this experiment): C. Haney, C. Banks, P. Zimbardo, Interpersonal Dynamics in a Simulated Prison, in «International Journal of Criminology and Penology», 1, 1983, pp. 69-97.The thing is very simple. As demonstrated by several experiments (and especially by people's behavior during Nazism and Communism), any harmless and ordinary man can turn into the worst sadistic. One can find many reasons playing a role in this transformation (conformism, sadistic personality, influence of the environment, etc), but none of them seem to be determinant. At the end, it remains the simple pleasure that somehow every man finds in cruelty. This is exactly what comes out of this movie: when the father asks: ""Why are you doing this?"", the guy answers with another question: ""Why not?"". Afterwards, he even explains to the family that they don't have to look for hidden reasons (as for instance a miserable and difficult childhood or whatever): this is missing the point.

I jump when something pops out on screen, I might even yell- I enjoy being in a movie and being scared. Yet, I am still able to go home to my big house full of windows, out in the middle of the woods and lay my head peacefully on my pillow afterwards. But not tonight. I have seen something that will hopefully be with me for days. I have been scarred in a way that I have been patiently waiting for, since I knew that a film could scar you, since my mom showed me The Exorcist. Funny Games was in one word amazing. No on-screen violence (just the way I like it), only the after-math. I did not scream, I did not jump, but I did cry. The director, Michael Haneke, tells the story as profusely as if he had 350 pages in which to write it in.

271,sj_cohn,"Funny Games, indeed",5,7 June 2007,"I wasn't thrilled by this Haneke effort, particularly in light of his other work... ""The Seventh Continent"", ""The Piano Teacher"", etc. Haneke is capable of great subtlety, shading and rich ambiguity. His films ask questions, and, generally, they don't rely on cheap devices and contrivances to do so.That being said... Funny Games did. It's been too long since I've seen the film to point to specific plot details as evidence, and I'm quite sure that I won't be seeing it again... and probably not even its remade version. (Few are the remakes in the history of film that are worth anything, but Haneke does have two things going for him: 1. He made the original; 2. The original was pretty abysmal, so there's nowhere to go but up... and no ""masterpiece"" or ""classic"" to which the remake will be compared.) But without these details, I think I can get to the essence of the Problem with this film.First, I don't think people really get this piece. They watch it literally, as some kind of horror/suspense film. Unless I'm grossly mistaken, this is an utter farce. Especially given Haneke's eye for the subtle and his ability to bring it to the screen... it seems to me nearly impossible that this wouldn't have seemed completely over-the-top to the director himself. And when I say ""over-the-top"", I don't mean in that way that an ""ultra violence"" film is over-the-top... still regarding itself as cool and hard hitting. I mean... this was ridiculous... unrealistic... foolishly obscene, etc. The question is... why? The answer is... because. Hehe. Because we deserve it. We live in a time where we're fascinated by murder, forensics, psychics, UFOs, conspiracies, etc. We like to watch ""reality"" on TV, warped sadistically into some twisted, satirical smirk in the mirror. This film isn't meant to be taken literally, the way I saw it. The film I saw was social commentary. It was contrived to be contrived, because the reality we live in is one that we contrive out of the building blocks that society gives us. We live in a sitcom or a movie clip... pointing at Topher Grace and saying, ""You know... I'm a lot like Eric."" ""Funny Games"" is every bad ""Lady in a Cage"" or ""Panic Room"" rolled into a ball and spat upon. It's funny, because the jokes on us, and we're not necessarily meant to see the point unless we seek it out. It's probably funny as hell for Haneke, because you can litmus test out the audience that way. Like... ""Oh, really... so you couldn't get past that totally ridiculous, plastic dialog..."" And I'm not saying that Haneke is smug, that way. I'm just saying that it's fun to play games at other people's expense, for just about anyone, and when you can reach more people by putting these games in the form of film, TV, etc... all the better.But that's why, to me, it's a failure. It's simple. It hinges on one particular contrivance, and the humor is totally one dimensional. There are those who ""don't get it"", and their questions are nil. Those who get it get it easily. The rewind should make it clear to this type of person, ""Ah, OK... he's laying bare the medium... showing that what we're looking at doesn't correspond to reality in any way."" It's a device. Devices, in themselves, are generally crude... because they only have a single effect. Again, those who ""get it"", get it easily, and easy film-making, to me, is poor film-making. And if it were easy but raised interesting questions, well enough. It does raise some questions, indeed, but it practically answers them. The basic answer being, ""People are suckers for mind-numbing violence, and they don't even know it."" OK. Hmmmm. BFD.",Funny Games

But, alas.Sometimes you do crave to watch movies which make you feel bad about the world so that you yourself feel ""being good"". Movie achieves that. Not intentionally but with its slow pace and uninteresting plot.No doubt that you will find acting very good. Everyone gave their best performances. But, due to intentionally ""uninteresting"" treatment given to the film, it makes it real boring. I mean there are movies which makes you blood boiling with the in-sensitivities in the world. For example, take a scene where Dr.Lessing is all concerned with the puzzles, in ""Life is Beautiful"", when Guido and his son is at stake. You feel bad. Or for that matter, check out the end of Eden Lake. You will get to see good and bad of everything.Here, with this movie, I was feeling bad only because it was not funny and was not ending soon.Only point it gets bit interesting is when after killing their son; Paul and Peter suddenly disappears. It makes you think that something interesting is coming. But, I would consider that Paul or Peter fast forwarded the movie (like in other shot); to save us from more boring scenes.Funny.So Michael, don't feel bad.

""Funny Games"" was successful at evoking some real emotions from me during the course of my viewing; however, at the end I had one question:  what is the point?  A friend tried to explain that it is a social commentary on violence, in film, media, and reality. Personally, i feel that any true message in this film is lost in its pretentious, self-indulgent, and utterly boring presentation. If Michael Haneke was completely concerned with getting that message across, there are other, more effective ways of doing that.  Specifically, i have several problems with ""Funny Games""*SPOILERS*1.The entire movie is disturbing and outright unnecessary.  I ask again, what is the point?2.While this is nitpicking, i have to ask the question:  Do the antagonists ever sleep?  The ending indicates they repeat their actions over and over again.3.If you thought ""Requiem for a Dream"" was a buildup to nothing, in terms of the ending, this movie follows in the same vein.  It evokes an emotional buildup in its audience while lacking a catharsis.4.Scenes in the middle of the film, after the protagonists leave the house, are boring, pretentious, and make the film seem much, much longer than it actually is.  I am speaking of the part in which the camera remains on the husband and wife without cutting away, showing essentially no plot development (which was really lacking anyway) for what seemed like fifteen (maybe more) minutes.  If you're in film school, you might enjoy this stuff, but for normal people it is just plain booooooring.5.Finally, the whole movie has a tone similar to the torture scene in ""Reservoir Dogs.""  Now, I love Tarentino's work, but that scene really turned me off to that movie, for similar a similar reason as my hatred for ""Funny Games,"" namely, pointless disturbing violence.  I have no problem with use of violence in cinema, as long as it makes a clear and valid point. ""Funny Games"" ultimately fails to accomplish this.*END OF SPOILERS*Ultimately, I hated this movie.

The perfidy of all this is, that the whole scenario plays in  down to earth real world, a beautiful lakeside estate somewhere in Austria and death comes by the hands of totally ordinary young men.What the audience hopes for is, that there has has to be an escape - in the end you most definitively know: There is none.",Funny Games

He took the remote and re-winded it: what a bullshit. Some of you might say that it has a meaning in the talks the young men had but not for me.Apart from a possible meaning everything was bad: the plot was completely unoriginal and unbelievable too (sometimes the parents did not look in a lot of pain after their son died) and as regarding the directions it was nothing special. Plus can you explain why some scenes in which nothing happened lasted forever?It reminded, in terms of director's intentions, to A clockwork orange (but also as someone said to Natural Born killer) but nothing to do with it. Natural Born Killer which is not one of my favorite movie is much more original and it makes you feel something. This movie is just an ugly rearranged copy of A Clockwork orange but it failed in every aspect. After watching it left me nothing. A total waste of time.MY ADVICE: DO NOT WATCH IT.",Funny Games

A baseless, pointless movie that puts you into the feeling that vital 2 hours of your life has been wasted.Michael Haneke is desperately trying to behave intelligent. In fact, I felt all of his movies (except Amour, of course) as too simplistic that comes up either with no logic or a stupid logic at the end. Even he can't explain what is happening in his movies. I would say, he is covering his mediocre or even lesser intellect by creating logic-less movies and finally asking the viewers to decipher the point themselves. I haven't ever seen a director who is as desperate as Haneke, trying to behave intelligent.Hey Haneke, your movies are too simplistic and totally void to deserve our attention. Go watch the works of Martin Scorcese, David Lynch, Christofer Nolan, or Tim Burton, and see how an intelligent(The one you always tries to become. No man, you are not!)movie is made!Overall, a very substandard film from an even sub-standard director.Rating 2.5/10",Funny Games
282,Flador,"unsettling, gripping movie",10,19 January 2004,"SPOILER: Okay... I just read most of the 144 user reviews.... Basically I wanted to make up my mind about this film, a film that is a very heavy load.I've seen this movie 5 years ago, the good thing is most of the time you forget about (having seen) it but now and then you recall it. I can understand that many people hate this film, it is not nice to watch, the more when you see it in a theatre where the only chance to break its spell is leaving the theatre. Regardless if you leave or stay and watch it leave it beats you one way or the other. I fully agree with many other reviewers that I have no idea whom I should recommend it too. I am tempted to watch it a second time but didn't make it happen in 5 years.Don't get me wrong. I think it is an excellent movie. It is also very disturbing and upsetting, I can't think of the right mood to watch it cause it'll take you down. And I think here is where the movie polarises. If, after watching, you find yourself deducting some message in the violence, and perhaps rethink violence - in both real life and movies - you will, well, also will have found some reason for this movies existence, if not - and it might be better if one does not - you will join in the 'crappiest movie ever chorus'.I do however want to point out some achievement of this production:*) The movie catches the audience in theatre. *) It does shock the audience but most of the violence is off-screen. You see more people dying in many fast-driven action movies. Only here you care. There is minor suspense, but I, personally, wouldn't put it into that category. (But then I am no horror/shocker/suspense fan and can easily err here) *) It's hard to compare it with any other movie (that I have seen). I am not sure if this is an achievement, but it's outstanding.The reason I think Haneke made this movie. or, what I deducted from it is how far away violence and death are in our everyday lives today. While Hollywood - and other film productions serve them daily right in our living room, we hardly notice them anymore. Violence also sells movies, and we're meanwhile pretty used to that. Haneke also serves violence, and he dishes it next-door. He turns into a moral figure that asks the audience if they want more (after all me and you consume it every day) - and while HERE we want to say 'no please stop' he doesn't do our silent bidding. He pushes us down the drain, forcing us to deal with aspects of the violence we don't (want to) see. He even goes one step further. He offers us a 'good' ending, a payback that would make it easier for us to bear the movie, only to snatch it back and rip us of any cheerful emotion, telling us like 'no, sorry, here it doesn't work that way'.I also read reviews mentioning the unsatisfying (often used, cliche) end. One more time Haneke manages to disappoint us, so far we were driven and didn't know what would happen, what to expect.Only in the ending, we see it coming, and so it ends, obviously similar to many other movies. We're back standard movie stuff, the arc bent and the connection made.""Funny games"" is everything else but the title. Perhaps it refers to the funny games built on standard film violence in everyday movies. Perhaps it doesn't. Perhaps Haneke wants to stress that violence is a bad thing. Perhaps he's just sick.One thing for sure, regardless if you like it, don't care, or hate it. You might have seen something somewhat like it, but nothing similar.If you hate shockers, don't watch it. It will only be torture. If you love suspense, sorry, only very little gore here.If you plan to watch it, calculate a few hours before you will manage to put your head to rest.And don't watch it it personal crisis.This movie will make you feel bad. If you watch it in a cinema, just look around. You're not alone with this feeling.",Funny Games
283,facebook-com-317-15372,Wonderfully filmed; content better not to have been seen,1,13 July 2012,As you would expect with Haneke it is wonderfully filmed. I forced myself to watch it to the end and wished that someone had advised me initially not to watch it. It is a film that disturbs and takes away.It gives nothing to explore in the wonder of humanity or a purpose of a redemptive spirit. Why watch a film that leaves yourself with less than when you started watching it? I disliked the effect it had the I removed the 2 DVDs from the box set and put them in the bin. Extreme enough to not want the content on site and yet Haneke's other films inspire and provoke such thoughts of us and our choices and our faith and the working through of love;real love that creates action and meditation/prayer.Advice: choose not to watch it; there is strength in this discipline and advice.,Funny Games

But in the case of this movie, I suppose the critics have gone awfully wrong. I mean unless the critics themselves have seen this type of genre more than enough, they would be in a good position to review this title. I am sorry but I have seen better than this and this was like total waste of time. The movie's pace is too slow, it is not that gripping and the story line is much too predictable. The movie failed to grip my attention as a horror thriller should have. These type of dark movies generally end with a sad ending or a mixed emotion ending - leaving something for the viewer. This movie left neither, the acting seemed awful, the direction was awkward or perhaps this movie could have been shot by any amateur. All in all a total waste of my time!",Funny Games

In that sense, I could appreciate this movie for the willpower of human survival against the most dangerous of all creatures and that there are people who have experienced such terrible acts.

286,james-752,brilliant film with only a few flaws,10,21 August 2004,"Although I consider this film to be one of the most disturbing of its genre, it makes a critical error which is becoming rampant in modern cinema. The key to the effectiveness of any film, particularly horror, is the ability to suspend the disbelief of the viewer. One has to be able to forget he is watching a film in order to truly empathize with the characters and, in horror, feel their terror. But at multiple points in the film, our lead sadist turns to camera to address us which manages to completely pull the viewer out of the terror and remind him that he is watching a film. I understand the appeal of post-modern film-making, but itreally has no place in horror. Absent this handful of scenes, however, this film is very convincing, brilliantly acted and is a must see for anyone who wants to be disturbed.",Funny Games

The story is not even logical, in critical situations the amount of bad luck shown is absurd. If you have seen this movie and liked it you should get some serious psychiatric help. Don't see it.

I thought this film was deeply disturbing and it actually is the kind of thing that could happen to any one of us at any time. If you watched the whole movie then you would see that the impact of violence was extremely strong after they left the house for the first time. Screen shot of the room with the family left torn apart and it stayed as a still image for a few minutes, giving you the time to take in what had happened and I think the mother and father left alive and their son dead is a good example of victims.... After all, people do say that to lose a child is the worst thing ever and thats exactly what happened here except they give you a long time to think about it before moving onto the next part of the movie.Before people make wild assumptions about movies I think it is better to watch the whole movie first and make up your mind before mouthing off your opinion, this film gets 10/10 from me",Funny Games

Please, potential future victim of this movie, listen to me this picture is cheap commercialism. Even if the director tries to immunize himself by spicing his story with pseudo-intellectual social commentary, his main, blunt motive is creating a financially successful entertainment product. I could live with that, if he was honest about it. However, his strategy is to perplex the audience with a few cheap, stale gimmicks. Just enough to keep them hanging in there and prevent them from walking out. The stupid, disappointing ending proves it and seals it. Insulting!

291,pimmelbuyback,Funny games for who ?,7,27 March 2009,"Prior on seeing this movie I had read a lot about it, an even a co-worker told me it was the most vile movie he ever saw and that he wished never to see it again. All that got me very curious and i stumbled upon an interview of M. Haneke where he explains Funny Games quite in-depth.Alert spoilers ahead : The beginning of the movie was very shocking, where the family gets physically injured. My blood was boiling and i felt the adrenalin flowing throughout my whole like in a bloodlust state wishing harm upon our 2 evil doers and even a few hours after the movie my limbs felt stiff. As it was no conventional fiction as the actors break the fourth wall multiple times so i decided to detach myself from the movie and it got more bearable and also a lot more fun by making comments in the theater. The 2 evil doers symbolizes the portrayal of violence in movies. Haneke has given them the traits of young well educated and wealthy killers based upon the fact that young people from middle and upper social classes had killed people only to experience the thrill of a kill. They have been on a torturing and killing spree for at least 48 hours and are heading for another 24 hours of vileness yet they don t have to sleep nor do they suffer from fatigue. I made it through the movie according to Haneke i needed it, as according to him i could i have walked out of the theater at any time ; well not really i was with someone.I will also give you the comments of my friend who saw the movie with me : He said he found it less shocking, disturbing than Requiem for a Dream or the Deer Hunter. I give it a 7 rating for it is a very well conceived movie with good acting, a sober pace and a bold purpose.

I would not be surprised to see this same incredibly well done story remade into an American version some day down the road.

The tone deaf director conveniently overlooks the fact that film is an audio and visual medium, and by including the sounds of a child being murder in his movie he is no better than the likes of Quentin Tarantino. The pretentious ""auteur"" doesn't bother to offer us justification as to why catharsis through cinematic violence is wrong.

Granted when I saw this flick I had not heard anything about it, didn't know what to ""expect"" except that this was the director who did the Piano Teacher. So, I was delightfully surprised by an opening that may be my favorite opening ever - on par with Blue Velvet- which sets a tone for the film but in doing so also leaves the viewer confused - wondering at a surreal scene composed of opposite extremes - the bizarre music with the equally bizarre ""perfect happy family"" twisting down an empty road to god knows where and god knows what. Foreplay. Like the films Funny Games lampoons, the opening is an invitation, hits a few very obvious buttons preparing the audience, gearing us up, winding... winding... winding. but no pay off. I have never heard of a nightmare with a happy ending. The film is relentless and as it runs the audience like mice through a maze - throws blinking signs that say ""this way out"" ""exit this way"" but just as we get to what might be a light at the end of the tunnel - SLAM!! goes the door and we're all set to running down corridors again, tripping on our tails. Great fun! Great terrible, horrible fun!I suppose if one were to put ones mind to it, one could find away to NOT get caught up in the film. I suppose one could see this film and not get wound up (excited) because there is never the ""pay-off"" no ""money shot."" But the fact is, this film works perfectly. I have heard people ""hate it because its stupid and boring"" because ""this movie is supposed to be intense, B.S. - no gore"" -and as they tell me this I fight to keep from snickering. It's hard not to laugh in their faces. These people are, by not liking the movie, solidifying the fact that the film has accomplished it's goal of exposing the foolish as foolish. To stand and hear someone so completely divulge their ignorance, their inability to ""get the joke."" It's uncanny. Funny Games holds these people in utter, biting contempt. I am quite certain that the Director made it his preoccupation to be certain this film would never be found enjoyable by the the drooling blood-lusting pencil-dick sect. This film is not for the lovers of violent cinema - the cousin of pornography -those closeted lovers of the rape scene. It is not for the masterbators who, through repetition, have worn away at the sheen of their self -indilgence; those who must find new ways to be excited. Funny Games is bored by these potential viewers and mocks them, hates them - hates me. Funny Games condemns even those who praise it. What fool would love an unpleasant experience? What fool would WANT to watch someone get killed, or raped? This film should be mandatory viewing for all 4th grade classes in America. They can see it in Health class.
