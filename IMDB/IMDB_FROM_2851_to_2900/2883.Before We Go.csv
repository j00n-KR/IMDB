0,SnoopyStyle,Evans' debut,5,5 July 2016,Nick Vaughan (Chris Evans) is a trumpet street musician in Grand Central Station. Brooke Dalton (Alice Eve) misses the last train home to Boston. She had her purse stolen and is stuck in NYC with only a train ticket. He tries to help her but he is strap for cash. He is reluctant to attend a wedding. She is married and is desperate to get home before her husband.This is Chris Evans' directorial debut. His directing is functional indie. It doesn't necessarily intrigue me visually. The obvious comparison is 'Before Sunrise'. One of the deficiencies for me is Brooke's secret. The movie holds on to that secret so tightly that it annoyed me. It also forms a barrier between Brooke and Nick. These are super sexy individuals. It would work fine with a simpler background. I would rather have them simply walk the streets of NY doing random things. This is fine for Evans' debut but it doesn't have that special charm.,Before We Go
1,writers_reign,Clock This,9,29 July 2019,"Several people who posted here - and all the posts I read were favourable - noted similarities to Before Sunrise but they weren't really annoyed about it and are probably savvy enough to know that no one writes/creates in a vacuum and almost inevitably the influence earlier films/novels/plays had on us will filter through our own efforts. I also found elements of a much older movie than Before Sunrise, namely Vincente Minnelli's The Clock (sometimes billed as Under The Clock), a film that dates from the 1940s and features Judy Garland meeting oldier Robert Walker in Grand Central station and falling in love. Comparison with the black and white Minnelli movie more or less ends there because Minnelli fills his film with excellent supporting actors like James Gleasons' milkman and Garland and Walker actually obtain a special license and get married. I'm thinking more of the 'feel' of the film and the for want of a better word 'innocence', supplemented by charm, class, style, call it what you will you'll find it in The Clock, Before Sunrise, and Before We Go; would it wer to be found it more films.",Before We Go
2,ferguson-6,Cap has gone soft,5,3 September 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Many people (not me) were (and still are) enthralled by Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight). Because of this, it's not shocking that a very similar type story would be set on the streets of New York City. However, you might be surprised to learn that Captain America himself, actor Chris Evans, has taken this on as his directorial debut.Mr. Evans also stars alongside Alice Eve (Star Trek Into Darkness), as they saunter their way through the city during the late night and early morning hours. In a borderline meet-cute opening, Nick (Evans) is tooting his trumpet in Grand Central Station when a frazzled Brooke (Eve) goes sprinting by and drops her cell phone. Brooke, of course, misses her train and Nick returns the phone fragments to her. He learns her purse was stolen and she lacks cash, credit and ID. Being a gentleman, he offers to help.The cynic in me couldn't help but wonder how helpful this gentleman would have been had the stressed out woman not been a world class beauty. Seriously, why do the all-night wanderers look like Chris Evans and Alice Eve, or Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy? Why don't they look like those people on the ""Wal-Mart"" YouTube videos? The film unfolds like a road trip movie  although it all takes place within a few city blocks. Each little segment is like a vignette, attached with string to the overall goal of getting Brooke back to her New Haven home before her husband arrives. See, both of our heroes are running from emotional and relationship turmoil  Brooke is avoiding a confrontation with her less-than-perfect husband, while Nick wants to/doesn't want to see his 6 years ago girlfriend (Emma Fitzpatrick). He came to the city for the trumpet audition of his life, but his internal battle is over whether to see his old flame  all while subtlety trying to win over Brooke. Yep, it's as lame and ridiculous as it sounds.A brief stop for a psychic reading is a highlight, if for no other reason than we get relief from the flirting, fighting, and philosophizing of Brooke and Nick in the form of veteran actor John Cullum – a little bit psychic and a little bit elder wisdom. The film does have a nice look to it - the city alternates between dreamy, dangerous and hardcore. Unfortunately, the overused shaky-cam has a negative impact on many intimate scenes, and prevents us from enjoying the colors, lights and textures of the city. Editing out the sprinkled profanities would make this an easy fit for Hallmark or the Lifetime channel. It's harmless enough, just not as charming or romantic as it tries to be.",Before We Go
3,phd_travel,Charming leads but ultimately a let down,5,11 September 2016,In Grand Central a busking musician meets a woman having marital problems who misses her last train. Together they embark on a nocturnal trip through the city. Chris Evans acts like a real charmer here though he ought to lose the beard. As if a girl would dump him. Alice Eve is a bit plump by Hollywood standards - it's refreshing to see someone not rail thin in a romantic role. They do have some on screen chemistry. Her character is annoying in the beginning of the movie.Why did they pick such ugly and unromantic parts of the city to shoot in? Spoiler alert: I have to discuss the ending since it's the main fault of the story. After all that they don't end up together? Feels like a waste of time - all that just because they helped each other vaguely?,Before We Go
4,deloudelouvain,Absolute garbage,1,13 August 2016,"I stumbled on this movie by browsing IMDb. I saw it had high ratings. I normally never watch romances/dramas but since it was also categorized as a comedy I thought I'll give it a shot. Please the wife a little bit, by watching something she would go for. And oh what was that a mistake. 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. They should make other categories on IMDb, like ""boring movies"" with a sub-category ""extremely boring"". That's where this movie belongs in. Nothing happened during 90 minutes, absolutely nothing, apart of two people talking about stuff nobody wants to hear of. And why is this categorized in comedy if there is nothing to laugh with? What's the point of deceiving people like that? Since I never stop a movie before the end, even if it is bad, I suffered, I really suffered with this one. I can't get why people like this kind of crap. And on top of that, my wife absolutely hated it as well. Do yourself a favor, and go watch paint dry instead of watching this garbage.",Before We Go
5,siderite,"A romantic movie that is true, but a little too safe",8,5 June 2016,"This is not a ""romantic comedy"", because it does not go for cheap laughs and fake situational faux-pas, instead is reminiscent of the Before Sunrise/Sunset films, showing people feeling real stuff and acting like human beings, not clichés. It does have humor in it, but it is simply a story of a meeting between two strangers.The only fault I find with the movie is that it is too safe. Chris Evans both produced and directed the film, not only starred in it, probably desperate to not be chained to the Captain America character for his entire career, but he didn't choose to do anything ground breaking. He went for the good looking Americans, the nicely bearded artist and the beautiful blonde, the muted dialog scenes with the romantic songs in the background, the almost too good to be true coincidences.In the end, it was a good film, certainly better than the swill that infests the genre, but it wasn't a great one. Still, don't regret watching it.",Before We Go
6,ThomasDrufke,"Don't Be Sad It's Over, Smile Because it Happened",7,31 January 2019,"In what is clearly Chris Evans homage to Before Sunrise and other 'one night and one setting' romances, Before We Go still manages to do more than charm and romance, it brings new ideas and concepts to a genre that always seems to be flooded with cliches. I love what this film says about fate, friendship, and that life is really just a play where everyone plays their own role in an overall story. Evans and Alice Eve have great chemistry and it's brief runtime makes re-watchability feel like an easy and necessary task. I think this one has even the most cynical viewers finding something refreshing real in Before We Go.7.5/10",Before We Go
7,Reno-Rangan,One night adventure with a stranger!,6,24 July 2016,"In his 15 year old acting career it was the Chris Evan's first direction. Many actors had tried that and only a few had succeeded, but some of them just preferred a low cost, simple project to avoid a major disaster. He also produced it and acted alongside the British actress Alice Eve. The film was a one night event based theme which begins when a young woman misses her train, and later forced to spend the night with a stranger after her purse got stolen. During lots of time left for the next train, theirs little adventure begins as they embark around the city.This is really a solid film. Well written screenplay and performed with a beautiful night adventure in the city that never sleeps. The problem with me was, I had seen many similar flicks, so this one looked okay, in a good way, but not that awesome. Still a fine film and definitely highly recommend others who like drama-romance. The plus point was the actors, the chemistry was brilliant. The story was very good, yet like I said it was so simple.It was not just two who meet and develop a friendship or a relationship, but they both reveal their story behind their visit to the city. At first it was a casual disclose, but the true reason comes out when they begin to trust each other and feel comfortable. So each of their tale has a small twist in the same night to overcome that was troubling them for some time. The film makes the impression that they two are made for each other, but only the final scene reveals how their destiny ends when the dawn breaks out. Not so clever, but an enjoyable little gem, maybe a perfect film for the date night.6.5/10",Before We Go
8,Thanos_Alfie,Romance...,6,29 November 2020,"""Before We Go"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a man helping a woman after she loses her purse, her phone and the train with which she would return to her city. A lot of things can happen or even change in one night and they both have many things to discuss.I liked this movie because it had a nice, simple plot with some beautiful scenes. The interpretations of both Alice Eve who played as Brooke and Chris Evans who played as Nick were very good and they made us feel that we are a part of their story while we followed them through the whole duration of the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Before We Go"" reminded me of the movie ""Before Sunrise"" but I believe that ""Before We Go"" is far better than ""Before Sunrise"". I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's simply beautiful and romantic movie that everyone has something to gain by watching it.",Before We Go
9,Floated2,Refreshing relationship drama,7,24 August 2017,"Before We Go appears to be the directorial debut of Chris Evans. Having success playing Captain America, he has yet to be getting such high profile projects apart from those films or the Avenger films. This film is quite different as a relationship type romantic drama and it shows. For a film where there is mostly talking and running around from different location, it is not boring and we immediately like the lead character played by Chris Evans. Alice Eve does a good job in her role playing hard to get at first, then eventually everything comes into place as we see the chemistry smoothen.Though this film is very predictable, in that we know by the end of the film both characters will end up being together and will cause a ""meant to be with each other effect"" despite the plot and storyline having issues that the characters are married or dealing with pains from another relationship. We have seen story lines like this before in that there are little issues stopping the leads from being with each other but as the film goes, little details come out and eventually everything works for the best. Some negative reviews say that this movie felt a little unrealistic and that it seems Alive Eve's character was lying about getting robbed since the film did not show her actually getting robbed, but that made it better and slightly less predictable, in that we are assuming she is being honest but it also kept up guessing if she was really telling the truth. Had they thrown in a twist that she was conning to Chris Evans for whatever reason, the tone would have been drastically different. This movie did have a relatively low budget and it showed. Overall, this is the kind of film Hollywood rarely seems to make anymore, and we can see why the audience rates this film so highly (a 6.9 on IMDb) as opposed to critics. Recommend if like simple based romantic dramas.",Before We Go
10,dar0417,Modern version of Before Sunrise,5,12 February 2020,Modern version of Before Sunrise that lacks all the qualities that Richard Linklater brought out the main actors.,Before We Go
11,yusufpiskin,Good work Chris Evans.,9,13 March 2020,"I honestly adore almost everything about this film, ad I'm surprised to be saying that since I had NO EXPECTATIONS going in.Alice Eve is simultaneously charming and troubled, and allows you to quickly delve into her character, who bounces perfectly off of Evans'. She has a roughness to herself here that prevents her from being a generic love interest, and I really appreciated that. Chris Evans though is the highlight of this film; for two reasons. Firstly, his acting is stellar here; as he plays his usual charming role but with a more sorrowful, thoughtful approach. This lets him make you fall for him as Eve does, but also appreciate his sly smugness. Secondly because I've always wanted to see one of his directorial efforts, and I wasn't disappointed. The film oozes stylistically, editing-wise and has a strong flair for character and emotion; and you can tell Evans had a heavy hand in this!Music choices and their scarcity were honestly perfect. The tone was mellow but tense. The length was great. Some parts drag but in a good way (if that even makes sense?). And the idea to show this pair meet and become closer over what is almost real-time was a perfect choice for this story! I know its obviously already been done before, but I think it was done particularly well here, as development happens organically.Oh my god, and that ending! Freaking perfect! I loved it!I'm surprised to be giving this such a high score, and it might only be this high because of my initial feelings. But at the time of writing this; I honestly can't recommend this enough! Do yourself a favour and indulge in this perfectly cheesy and touching tale of love and self-discovery. I'm sure you won't regret it...",Before We Go
12,cekadah,"Linklater's ""Before Sunrise"" - New York style!",4,26 July 2015,"Nick and Brooke meet inside Grand Central Station, both are short on cash, Nick wants to help Brooke because her purse was stolen and her cell phone broken. The NYC adventure begins.Unfortunately for me I found this plot shallow and way too linear. There is just no chemistry between Evans and Eve. First Alice Eve is pigeon-toed and seeing her walking in those boots was just painful. Plus she should refrain from smiling too often! Chris Evans was more like a comic book character than a young man conflicted about the woman he loves. He just seemed distant and personally uninterested in being Nick.The story is very polite and well behaved but the A.M. adventure just never gets going to give the viewer something to connect with to the main characters. Their dialog is just to often self involved and lacked sophistication. And by time morning has arrived you are glad they go their separate ways.Sorry, I just couldn't get 'involved' with these two as I got involved with Jesse & Celine in 'Before Sunrise'.",Before We Go
13,Seraphion,Nice fluid story that flows quite unpredictably,7,16 September 2015,"The story is quite risky as a drama because it starts like many of those other dramas did, with two strangers meeting at a public place and end up getting close in a course of one day. This movie takes that kind of start point and took it up a notch by shortening the duration into just one night. Honestly I watched this movie starting with no high expectation considering that it would be just another spare time project for Chris Evans. But instead this movie delivered quite a something indeed. The overall mood of downtown New York streets at night is really neat to explore in this movie including all the good and bad things that could happen there. Also the movie has its story flowing fluidly, not really wasting much in dialog time before advancing to new scenes and story developments. There are many twists to the story that was quite unpredictable for me. And even the ending had me fooled for thinking that the couple will unite. The acting overall is just at a standard level. Chris Evans apparently had a hard time in adjusting to other character besides his most frequent and most popular portrayal of Captain America. Alice Eve did quite ell in her part but still really need to work more on her expressions.",Before We Go
14,larrys3,Dialogue Often Seems Staged,6,30 November 2015,"Maybe I'm from the wrong demographic, but this film never entirely clicked for me. It certainly has its moments, but overall the main problem was in the script (written by 4 screenwriters), which often came across to me as staged and awkward.Chris Evans stars here as Nick, a trumpeter readying for an important audition with a jazz band in New York City. He also makes his motion picture directorial debut here and I thought did a credible job. Alice Eve, the charismatic and underrated actress, co-stars as Brooke, an art consultant, who has just had her purse stolen and subsequently has missed the last train out to her home in Boston.Nick and Brooke meet by circumstance in Grand Central Station, and together they begin an odyssey through the streets of Manhattan, each with relationship problems weighing heavily on them. Brooke's marriage may be ""on the rocks"" and Nick is scheduled to be at a wedding reception that night where a lost love (Emma Fitzpatrick), from years before is expected to be in attendance, as he still fantasizes and pines for her.The chemistry between Nick and Brooke really worked well, I thought, so the eventual question will be whether they will get together romantically or be like two ""ships passing in the night"".Overall, there are things to like here, including the wonderful cinematography of Manhattan at night, plus two charismatic actors commanding the screen. However, I was never ""sold' on this movie due to the often non-believable and clichéd dialogue.",Before We Go
15,jacobs-greenwood,Not for the short attention span crowd,7,11 May 2017,"Before We Go (2014) is an intelligent and interesting story of ""two ships that pass in the night"". Chris Evans (who also directed it) and Alice Eve play two people - each at different crossroads in their individual lives - who come across one another in Grand Central Station (New York City) as it closes for the evening.What transpires is a study of relationships and of life in general as each examines their own circumstances and those of the other. By helping one another, the two try to 'fix' problems borne of their own decisions and characteristics that have affected their personal lives and specific relationships with the opposite sex.There are several scenes in which the 'couple' has to work together in creative ways, attempting to solve a particular issue, which are as realistic as they are entertaining. John Cullum is excellent in his role - playing a psychic, no less - as one that assists them along the way.Spoiler - the interaction between the two leads is (almost entirely) platonic, which will frustrate moviegoers who expect or need more. But because director Evans really probes each character's flaws and vulnerabilities, there are truths that leave those willing to stay with the narrative very satisfied despite its nontraditional ending.",Before We Go

17,witster18,"Surprisingly realistic, and well-acted rom-dram.",7,31 March 2016,"I was a little hesitant to press play on what I expected to be a romantic comedy. ""Before We Go"" isn't a comedy. It is at times a painfully realistic drama. Alice Eve and Chris Evans sell every aspect of this film, and the ending is handled with a exquisitely deft touch. There were a million opportunities to turn this into a cliché ridden nightmare of a movie, instead, Evans shows some solid directing chops, steering this vehicle in such a realistic manner that the film will surely have staying power.. It might even deserve a sequel. I'd pay to see it, even though this stuff isn't usually my cup-o-tea.The obvious comparison is ""Before Sunrise"".. While that earlier film may be more well- written, it isn't as hard-hitting and realistic as ""Before We Go"". This film is right on par with that earlier work. Certainly the characters are more fleshed-out, and the overall impact and ending a bit deeper. There is a chemistry here that somehow works, and it works perfectly within the context of the story. Our two leads are NOt a good fit. They both are not looking for a new relationship, and are seemingly in their hour-to-hour relationship for selfish reasons. They agree that they're not a good fit, but hours of confiding in each other and earning each others trust start to break down the walls they've built around themselves.The film seems keenly aware of the power of love, and yet understands it's fragile nature at the same time. Kudos to both leads. The music is nice. The ending perfect, and the pacing fine(despite some knocks on that in other reviews - i mean go watch Point Break - i just did.. And it stunk next to this). Top 25 for 2015? It may sneak onto the bottom of the list.. And i've seen 91 films from '15. Solid flick.",Before We Go
18,davyd-02237,Missing: enjoyment!,2,11 July 2021,"This is one of those ""highly rated"" films they showed during the 2020 Euros in 2021! The write up alone persuaded it should be watched. Watching paint dry is somewhere closer to enjoyment. These 2 folk go from 1 situation to another which starts when she misses her train at Grand Central Station. A little later when he is punched in the nose, it heals within minutes! Wouldnt say no to something that can do that.

19,meydiana-65242,Simple story but it has deep meaning!,9,25 September 2021,"This movie... god, this movie... words fail to express just how deeply this movie moved me. At the end, I just sat there, tears rolling down my face, watching the credits and feeling a cathartic feeling that rarely have I ever felt due to watching a movie.It's the one night tale of a chance encounter that explores concepts of love and the reality of each and every decision we make as well as their consequences. But it also lets us understand that we are very rarely alone and that in just a matter of hours, we can be changed for the better, forever.One of Chris Evans' best performances (in my humble opinion) and Alice Eve was incredibly human as well. Amazing chemistry and acting! Great directing debut for Evans as well. The undertones leave you speechless and the ending has you blown away.Without a doubt, one of, if not my favorite movie of all times. (The fact that Chris has never looked so good also helps ;P) Definitively worth a watch; ignore the pessimistic critics that have no emotions whatsoever! A good, easy to watch, nicely paced film.

20,frukuk,Captain America unthawed,1,28 July 2020,"Perhaps it was that it was too long -- so that it jogged along lethargically, rather than racing, breathlessly? Perhaps it was that it was badly written? Perhaps it was that it was miscast? Perhaps it was that it was poorly directed?Whatever the cause, this just felt remarkably emotionless. The two leads were apparently going through some emotional turmoil and yet it felt like they were experiencing no emotions at all: all head, no heart.A very disappointing film.",Before We Go
21,vjnambu,An above average directorial debut of Chris Evans,6,25 April 2019,"Chris Evans directorial debut before we go has its moments here and there. Story is pretty good, script is average and direction is neat. I liked the level of maturity Evans shown in portraying emotions and relationship. Climax is adequate. Chris Evans was perfect as lead and Alice eve was decent. But the movie is heavily inspired from before sunrise with only conversations going on with slow pace. Its not interesting as before sunrise. Also evans and eve lack a good chemistry which is a must for romantic films. If you loved before sunrise, you may end up liking it, but watch with less expectations.",Before We Go
22,Rendanlovell,An embarrassing directorial debut from Chris Evans,2,5 April 2016,"'Before We Go' stars Alice Eve and Chris Evans. This is also directed Chris Evans. That's right, Captain America has made his directorial debut with this ""romantic comedy"". The film mainly follows these two people as they go through a really terrible night together. One is trying to get home before a certain time and the other is attempting to get help out. And that's about it. The one thing that really disappointed me about this movie, among many many other things, was the story. It's paper thin. Within these first few sentences I have summarized the entirety of the movie. And it doesn't even pretend to be anything different.It gets stuck in this endless circle of nothing and it makes for an eerily boring movie. But the worst part is the fact that the film virtually ends at the midway mark. The sole goal that these two where working towards gets over and done with in the quickest most lazy way possible. And we still have to sit through another forty five minutes.After this point there is absolutely no reason that the film should still be going. For the remaining half of the film we get these two schmucks wandering around doing nothing. Many are saying that this is able to stand on the charisma of its two leads. But it can't even do that. Why? Because these two have some of the worst on screen chemistry I have ever seen a romcom of this nature.For ninety percent of the run time I got the feeling that these two hated each other and where simply trying to force it for the movie. They hardly ever look at each other when they talk. And when the two ""talk"" to each other off screen it's painfully obvious that they aren't. There is no other way to describe it than, they are just going through the motions.It was painful to see these two solid actors be like this. We know they are better this, so why did neither put forth any kind of effort? Chris Evans has all kinds of charisma as the first avenger but here he is reduced to nothing more than a loser. He says stupid one liners, conveniently has no money, and has a back story so stupid that it's impossible to care about him.And Alice Eves performance is so laughably bad that a random bum off the street probably would have been better. She mispronounces words, says just about everything in monotone, and stares at her shoes more than at anything or anyone. Why she choose to be the stuck up diva that no one on earth likes, I will never know. The film has created two characters that so incredibly unlikable that were then performed in the most amateur way possible.For a movie that banks on you shipping these two as couple, this is the worst possible thing it could have done. This is only made worse by the incredibly unclear character motives. These unclear motives are made even more muddled when the story decides to resolve its main conflict nearly half way through. As I said earlier, after this point there is no reason for it to continue. The motives disappear and the plot along with them.This movie has so many problems that it's almost unbearable to watch. Without the hilariously bad performances, line delivery, and nonsensical story it probably would be unwatchable. It doesn't seem to understand basic film making, which is rather perplexing when taking into account the high profile names it holds. The script is lazy, the story convenient, the characters flat, and the chemistry non existent. Which explains why its audience is also, non existent.",Before We Go
23,nicolechan916,Humanistic,7,9 June 2016,"The word to describe this movie is, 'humanistic'. It isn't your typical Hollywood movie, and though doesn't have the feel of an indie film, it is somewhat in between the two. Before We Go is a film about raw human emotions and behavior. It explores the lives of two strangers as they connect with each other on a individual level. While it can be boring for those who are used to scenes of action after action, I found it reasonably enjoyable. As the film goes on, the characters' backgrounds are slowly revealed and we learn more about them. For me, the movie does not really excite or get me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next, or what happened before. Rather, it made me live in the moment of the movie. I was going through the night with the characters, much like how you can't rush life. Evans does a great job as the charming, helpful, lost soul who wishes to escape his life by wasting time. On the other hand, it took awhile for me to warm up to Eve's character. Eve's acting felt a little awkward initially, and the chemistry between the two felt a bit off. But as the movie went on, it gets better, and that could reflect how connections are made in real life. Overall, a charming movie with a intricate perspective on life and love.",Before We Go
24,dallasryan,Very Well Written,8,7 January 2018,"A great film! Very well written and one of Chris Evans and Alice Eve's best. The acting is spot on and Evans and Eve have great chemistry. It's a funny film with sincere and true distresses in life, but it never becomes contrived which a lot of films like this tend to do. It stays true to itself and to life, never missing a beat. We all feel what these two characters have been through, it's a movie that will really hit home for most people watching it. I would like to see Chris Evans do more films like this, he's a terrific, and very underrated actor. Same goes for Alice Eve as well.

27,a.lampert,Gentle romance with intelligent script.,8,17 March 2021,"Some reviewers clearly have no romance in their souls by only dismissing this little gem with one or two stars. I was so pleased to sense from the start that this was not like most contemporary films. No swearing, no shouting, no crashing music, just a gentle slow building relationship between two lost souls who meet by accident at Grand Central Station in New York when a woman walking past a man sitting down, drops something that he picks up and then calls after her so that she stops. Chris Evans and Alice Eve play the couple who, finding they are caught in a moment where they can unburden some skeletons on each other and thus get some relief from their current problems, spend the night walking and talking and, obviously to us the audience, start to fall in love, although they are wrestling with their consciences and are clearly confused by their emerging feelings. To me this part of the film was the most charming and so well acted from all the little nuances displayed on their faces. This isn't so much about what is said as what their looks convey. We don't often see a film where so much time is spent building a relationship like this and I found it an absolute pleasure and I was quite smitten with Ms Eve. For years I've been a long term fan of her father, British actor Trevor Eve who i first took to in his TV series Shoestring many years ago and she's inherited much of his acting talent. Chris Evans who I had great difficulty in getting to like in those superhero roles, completely reverses my opinion in this lovely film and shows what a sensitive actor he can be, and he directed too. 8 stars from me but not for hard hearted. This shows beautifully how two people can fall in love. Don't be deceived by the comedy title above, romantic drama, yes, but not a comedy.",Before We Go
28,ReganRebecca,Belongs to the cottage industry of Before Sunrise imitators,4,25 June 2017,"There's a big problem with Chris Evans' debut. That problem is cell phones. To rewind a little bit: the film is about an incredibly handsome but sad busker (Chris Evans) working at Grand Central Terminal in NYC. Playing for the late crowd he stays long enough to see a woman (Alice Eve) rush out to catch the last train out. Her cellphone smashes as it falls out of her bag as she passes by. He does the right thing and tries to return it to her which is easy as she's missed the last train out. And she's been robbed. And being a poor busker despite his valiant attempts to be gentlemanly and help this woman this man, Nick, has no money. Also HIS cellphone is dead! And on it goes...It is perfectly plausible in real life that these inconveniences would pile up. In a movie it begins to stretch the boundaries of plausibility, especially since any person watching the film will know it's a romance and that these two attractive strangers will now be doomed to wander the city alone at night together slowly confessing secrets to one another and falling in love... Because yes, this belongs to the little cottage industry of Before Sunrise imitators. Before Sunrise for those not in the know, is a delightful little walking and talking movie from 1995. It also features two young gorgeous heterosexuals walking around a city (Vienna) and falling in love. Unfortunately for all the little imitators that have cropped up since, Before Sunrise is not as simple as it looks. It features two actors with great chemistry, a really genius script, and it takes place in the 90s when cellphones, credit cards and access to the internet weren't as ubiquitous as they are now. Unfortunately for Before We Go it really pales in comparison to a movie made nearly 20 years previous. Not only does the script not really ever get a handle on the cell phone issue (and I was reminded while watching this of Fort Tilden an excellent contemporary film about getting lost in a city where the characters have access to cellphones and ready cash and still manage to screw up their lives in increasingly hilarious, and yes plausible, ways) but the dialogue isn't that great either the reveal of why Alice Eve's character had to catch that train is dumb. The solution to her problem, when it comes, is dumb AND EASY. Chris Evans fans will be pleased though. The guy has charisma in spades and once Alice Eve's character gets over her fear that this guy Nick might be a creep rapist stalker, he's able to romance her with seductive looks. If you find Evans attractive and are willing to suspend your disbelief about how absurd a situation can get then by all means, watch this movie and allow yourself to be seduced by the romance. For everyone else it should be a hard pass.",Before We Go

30,stebird,"Before we go, let's have a memorable night",7,30 July 2017,"Chris Evans shows some silky talent in his directional debut, he stars alongside Alice Eve in a rather enjoyable, if short, tale of two strangers who spend an unplanned night together. After missing her 1:30 train from New York to Boston, Brooke is horrified to learn that she will be spending the night in the Big Apple, but with no money and no place to stay, she knew straight away that this would be a memorable night, what she didn't know was that the complete stranger that approached her at the station would be the guy she'd end up spending it with.Nick is a struggling musician who travels nowhere without his trusty trumpet, seeing a clearly upset albeit strong woman stuck at the train station, he swoops in and takes his chance. Before We Go chronicles the couples quickfire, one night only tale as they travel around New York like a pair of dreamy kids, with no money between them, they sure can find their own forms of entertainment. What I really liked about the film is the lack of sex, in films like these sex is generally the focal point, but not in this one, there was however a strong essence of sexual repression, but that made the story a whole more interesting and watchable. It reminded me of the films from a bygone era, where they could make an enjoyable film without any sex whatsoever.Certainly one of the better independent films I have seen for a while, both acting performances from the two leads were great, they demonstrated credible professional discipline and had wonderful chemistry together. Alice Eve has always been a personal favourite of mine and it was nice to see that Chris Evans can prove himself as a quality actor, and he isn't simply typecast as the over saturated super- dork Captain America.Set in the space of one night, it was refreshing to see a film so well made in such a tight space of time.Not world class by any stretch of the imagination, and in ten years most would've forgotten Before We Go even existed, but for what it is, it's defiantly a quality piece of film-making and all involved particularly Chris Evans and Alice Eve should be commended.",Before We Go

That says a lot. I was wondering WHY the directing was so bad. He put the camera RIGHT in Alice Eve's face. WHY? He SOMEHOW managed to make a beautiful actress look ugly. You NEVER NEVER NEVER shoot someone from a low angle. Even youtube stars that 'direct' their own videos know that.... What a novice move. Did he do that to show how 'stressed' she was? We know she does have dialogue and is a good actress....she is capable. How insulting to the actress.Why did he direct this? As if he does not have enough work as an actor? He is in movie after movie...I don't get it, is he greedy?Anyways the movie. BORING. We don't even get to see how she was robbed. All the action and pay off is not in the movie. Why the movie is confusing. It's like you feel like you missed the start and end of the movie. It started half way though. Confusing.....Since you did not see the robbery you are not convinced it actually happened, is she lying. I mean sign of a bad movie if you HAVE to go online for answers. A movie has to AT LEAST convey the basics to you. Near the end we never figure out what even happened. Just so open....Even in the movie details are left off....I just watch 2 people wander around. Eat food, go to a party, hotel, sit down....can't I just see that in real life? I came to see a movie, a story told to me. This was no story.",Before We Go

35,SteveMierzejewski,Before Sunrise...in New York,8,13 November 2015,"This is a film of the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight genre. Two people meet by accident and spend the night getting to know each other. The characters' personalities and lives are slowly unveiled through stories about their pasts and their relationships. It is, like all such movies, heavily dialogue-dependent. This means that the dialogue must be clever enough and compelling enough to keep the viewer interested. In my opinion, it meets these standards.The acting is good and the relationship between the two main characters (Chris Evans and Amy Eve)is believable. They really do seem to have some chemistry between them. If this wasn't present, the movie would have flopped. No one wants to watch a film about two people pretending they like each other. The relationship evolves logically and not like it would in a regular romcom. True, sometimes the dialogue is a little too good to be believable (they never talk about how tired they are even when it's 4am and they've been up all night), but at least it's witty and entertaining. You slowly learn that they are either in, or have been in, dysfunctional relationships, and they begin to build their own relationship around this shared core.This movie will never be a blockbuster. It will not appeal to the usual movie viewing target, the 15-year-old male. There are no explosions, car chases, or shoot-outs appearing at the critical seven-minute-attention-span stage that these modern viewers are said to possess. You actually have to watch the movie to get involved in it. I would say that the movie targets the 25+ group or people that have already been through serious, but dysfunctional, relationships and are somehow trying to rebuild their lives without being jaded. For this reason, it is a good couple's movie, as it will offer plenty of topics to talk about after the film finishes. The movie neither favors the male nor female viewpoint. Male viewers generally don't enjoy romcoms and it's not because they are against films that focus on relationships. It's because they have seen enough of them to realize that the film's structure and ending are simply too predictable. Male viewers will not have this problem with this film. In fact, for some, the open-ended conclusion might be a let down. I may have wanted more resolution myself, but others may feel comfortable with it. I can't go into more detail here. In any event, it seemed to leave the door open for a sequel and, if that is as good as this film was, I would welcome that.",Before We Go

37,Serge_Zehnder,"Easy to criticize, but done with great compassion",7,19 August 2015,"To bash this movie as a ""Before Sunrise"" knockoff is easy, and maybe even somewhat true. But at the same time it would be missing the point.Yes Chris Evans' directorial debut is also about two characters who experience a chance meeting and spend a night together. But ""Before We Go"" is if anything about adult choices and confronting their consequences. The exuberance of romantic love that is part of Richard Linklater's 1995 masterpiece is merely the starting point here. Nick (Chris Evans) and Brooke (Alice Eve) are beyond their college years and try to make amends with elements of their past. The strolling poetry of ""Before Sunrise"" is turned into an odyssey that throws the couple into various directions. Kismet is of course the essence of the story and it has to be said that the screenplay sometimes struggles with the very basic conceit of a night in New York. But...there are a few scenes that are spellbindingly played by the two wonderful leads and a few truths about love and heartbreak are uttered that remain very real. It could also be said that the movie delves into certain elements of ""Before Midnight"", even though it never reaches the depth of that movie either.Yet ""Before We Go"" merits a viewing for those introspective souls who put their faith in destiny while being sometimes at odds with their journey.",Before We Go
38,thokocnamangale,A heart warming teen romance movie...for adults,9,17 May 2021,"It got the job done without being extra cute or explicit.

They do fall for each other but at the end of the night they face reality. Still, they leave and go their separate ways cherishing the little time they spent together.Yes, it feels a whole lot like the Before trilogy but I think it's special on it's own, and as hard as it may be, shouldn't be compared in order to fully enjoy it. If you haven't watched the Before trilogy I suggest you watch this first because Before sunrise and before sunset are some of the best movies ever made in the genre so it would be unfair to bear comparison.On a side note, I feel like if you took Steve Rogers out of the MCU into a romance movie, this would be it lol.

This is Chris Evans' directorial debut - I think he might have done better not to have taken the lead and spent more time behind the camera. It lacks sharpness and energy as a result.All that said Chris Evans and Alice Eve are both good looking on the screen, it's well filmed and it ably evokes the feeling of sitting around late night having missed a train waiting for something to happen.It's not a film that you say to a friend ""you must watch this!""

They both come across as flawed yet likable. The dialogue between the two is interesting, funny and, at times, painful.

42,afallguns,Before We Call Him...,8,11 August 2015,"Director America, is that it?Who could know? Another Teenage(wet)dream actor, shows himself as a quite decent director! (Yeah, that's racist!) Jokes apart, I really enjoyed the work developed by Chris Evans in this project! It's clear that this is a homage to Linklater's Before Trilogy, a very good one, but that doesn't take away any credit of the movie. Actually, this is a dangerous genre of movie, a chemically instable, and a simple line can ruin a whole movie. Congrats Mr. Evans, you mastered the potion!I can say good stuff about the directing through the whole night, but that is unnecessary. I really like that simple shots, when the whole panorama is the only thing that matters and the protagonists are just a fraction of it. Also the awesome feeling that they didn't closed any of the locations and they rolled the whole movie outside the studios, it's just awesome (They might have closed all the locations and filmed all the inside scenes in the studios, but don't feel like it in neither of the cases for me!) Personally, I loved the shots in the Grand Central and at the subway train.About Alice and Chris. What a lovely couple of any Rom-com imaginable! But why waste such talented actors in a random Rom-Com, that people will forget as soon as they leave the theater? Both Alice Eve and Chris Evans shown their talent, beyond their beauty, mostly in recent years, and they delivered in Before We Go a mature, deep and really emotional performances. But there's no good leading acting without good supporting acting! Despite their short appearances, Emma Fitzpatrick (Hannah), John Cullum (Harry) and Mark Kassen (Danny), really fill, perfectly, their places, in the mostly pleasant way possible.About the writing. Some people say that this is Before the Sunrise in NYC. It could be. But it isn't... Before the Sunrise is about two young tourists, who decide to enjoy the night in a city (Zurich?), before they take the morning train. It's love, flirting, and ""I'm up all night to get lucky""... Before We Go, on the other hand, is about two late twenties, early thirties, in a very introspective day, for both of them, and a day that everything (or just a couple stuff) goes wrong! And they try, together, to survive that awful (or not that bad) day... The formula is pretty much the same of Linklater's Before Trilogy, but is not Before the Sunrise NY! The script was well written. Many good lines, a couple clichés here and there (but they're clichés for a reason), but mostly of all, I liked how the movie is plausible. How the story has this vein of truth.I had my share of nights walking around the city, without a way home... And some of those nights had their share of characters. Some ended in a good one night stand, some with a buzz-kill rejection, a couple with just a good talk and a couple others ended with a life-long friendship of one night.This movie hit the right vein, for me. If you get the ingredients that you love, assemble them in a plausible recipe, you WILL have something you like for dinner! The formula, the actors, the plot, the way that was shot plus the good execution... I could only love it!P.S.: How awesome was ""My Funny Valentine""? Did they two really performed the song? If yes... Claps to both of them! If don't... Claps to who performed!",Before We Go

i love this movie for being romantic, but still very true to reality with no over drama, no over romantic, and no Hollywood style romance; in life we meet people, we attach to people, we say good bye to people ... and sometimes we meet again.I love that Alice behaves as such at the beginning, it is much closer to reality!I love the role that Chris plays throughout the movie. It is a REALLY good interpretation of how a man should behave: being rudely rejected at first from Alice but it's not affecting his ego, and he still behaves as a real centred man should (joking about it and still being his true self); the only time he is being shaken up, is when meeting his ex - which truth be told, is how most people would react when they still have strong LOVE for their ex. Those scenes make it more truthful. (No fun moment, joke moment or over reaction at that time !)I love that we don't see what they have drawn, it is THEIR moment of intimacy; and since either one of them have any idea on what the other has created; so why should we?!I love that at the end, it is sudden; (again, it is not meant to us to know what is behind the paper, only Alice knows: maybe it is just ""I will love you forever"", maybe an address, maybe a phone number ... or - why not - another fun surprise from Nick like ""see you at -train station- on -time and date"")""Before We Go"" feels so right!

The acting is excellent, and the dialogue is believable, natural, and honest. This is not your average romcom, and it might not even qualify as a romcom at all, because although it asks many of the kinds of questions that romcoms try to ask, it answers them with far more maturity than most do. This story has themes that resonate and an ending that delivers. There are moments of the transcendent alongside moments of the awkward, and that gives the experience a ring of realism. The personal mysteries are revealed at a good pace, and the story never becomes saccharine, boring, or entirely predictable. I appreciated the good use of silence. I was occasionally annoyed by the unnecessary shakiness of the hand-held camera or the blurry focus of foreground objects, but that only happened a couple of times. This is otherwise a beautiful, thoughtful, quiet, poignant, and true character piece, and it's well worth the watching.",Before We Go
45,sukanya-samy,"Nice, quiet movie to watch",6,28 October 2016,"In between all the big studio movies of Thor, Avengers and Captain America, Chris Evans finds some time to direct his debut with this quiet, subdued film about two strangers falling in love in one night.Plot and Script (P&S)Nick Vaughan (Evans) and Brooke Dalton (Alice Eve) meet by accident in New York subway when Dalton misses her last train from NY to Boston. She must get back before her husband, else all hell will break loose. Vaughan, a struggling musician, decides to help her and get her to Boston. He himself is in NY to audition in front of a music legend but also because his ex, who he thinks is her soulmate, is there.The film is about this night, when these two strangers help each other through their worst fears, falling in love in the process.Frankly, I was sold on the description of the movie on Netflix so I found the story and the plot quite sweet. It is a take on soul mates, how one might feel that there is someone out their who is perfect for you. But they obviously didn't get into the details and it did seem a little implausible that two strangers would fall in love without knowing too much about each other.Characterization and Acting (C&A)I liked the characters of Vaughan and Dalton, they seemed real enough. Though Dalton/Eve broke out in her natural English accent every once in a while, which was a little weird. And there is also the question of trusting a stranger in NY. It just seemed too easy. Anyways, it is a story and a probable one at that. Dalton is not happy in her marriage and I can see how she might be attracted to Vaughan and vice-versa.The acting was okay-ish, though sometime Evans has limited expressions on his face. Evans was also too-nice a person in the movie, though likable. The dialogue was not too great – it was pretty standard for a romance and nothing new.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The sounds were really good in this movie. The night sounds of NY were quite real I felt and the music was good too.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)The feel of the movie was very charming. The editing was good, it was slow and gentle in places it was supposed to be and the visuals were stunning. The magic of NY in the night was so beautifully captured, it was amazing.Direction and Overall (D &O)Well, I liked Chris Evan's debut as a director – obviously it was not perfect but it was a really good romantic flick. It was sensible, felt real and the sequences were logical. It was a straight forward meet-cute and I wish there was some inventiveness to the story.So here are my scores according to my new system:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1.0Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1.0Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1.0Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1.5Overall Score – 6.0 out of 10Watch it one of those days when you want to see a new romance, when you are tired of all your already watched romcoms and you will like it.First reviewed on broth of blogs on wordpressYou might also like:Mother's DayBad MomsSeven Pounds",Before We Go

Before We Go is the directorial debut of Chris Evans, who does a very decent job, I must say. The story revolves around Nick Vaughn(Chris Evans), a street musician and Brooke Dalton(Alice Eve), a painter. Both of them meet at a chance encounter at the Grand Central Station in New York, when Brooke misses her last train and she has no way to return back home (her purse gets stolen). Nick is packing his trumpet for the day, and readying himself for a jazz audition the next day. The station is closed and Brooke is left stranded. Nick lends a helping hand, and together, they spend the night roaming in the streets of New York, singing in marriage receptions, on trains, at a seers house and coffee shops.
The chemistry between the leads is not an immediate spark and flame, but is palpable and slow burning. The movie explores the perceptions of life, loss and love. Nick is left questioning about true love, while Brooke on her ruining marriage. The strangers who started off as being friendly, landed on spilling each others innermost secrets, turned each other's advisers and ended up as support. I honestly liked the way Evans handled the take on love: delicately, with meaningful perception and dialogue. Well, as Nick says, ""It is possible to love two people in a lifetime.""

It seems that's the only thing we can take from director Chris Evans' directorial début. Not a new thing though to see a director starring as the lead actor in his/her film. Ben Affleck did it twice with critical and box office success in (Argo) and (The Town). Joseph Gordon-levitt also achieved the same feat, but with mediocre results in (Don John). These are recent examples. But there is a dilemma in figuring out the problem in (Before We go)-few questions to ask. Although I am not saying the film is that awful, but we have to ask if Chris at the back of the camera is able to handle his abilities as a director. Or might it be a problem with the screenplay where characters walk around and not get weary or that things sort of happen for convenience. The hitch might even be Chris Evan's fault. Perhaps he is not suited for a lead character. But then some would cite his pivotal as Captain America in the MCU, which I in turn could counter with saying that the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is because of the brand name and not its lead cast-an argument that can be weakened if my debater should bring up a certain recent film where the train doesn't stop: I am talking about (Snow piercer). To even buttress my point further that Chris is not suited for a leading character is by taking a look at his filmography. The actor has always had that un serious playboy streak, which has always aided his performance as a supporting cast. If you want examples, then go see (Fantastic Four) or (The Ice Man)The plot of the films gyrates on two strangers who meet each other at a train station and are drawn to each other: an idea that has already been harnessed to death, which brings up another hypothesis on one of the reasons for the film's failures: Chris directed a film based on a concept that has been used so many times, but spins nothing new to it.

61,videospoon,"Prett boy in a horrible ""yentl syndrome"" movie",1,11 November 2016,"Co Produced, directed, written and starring in a film is what constitutes a ""Yentl Syndrome"" of an actor having too much control and it is named after Streisand and her film. Boring self indulgent and slow is the story of a young man who tries to help a girl and falls in love with her. I am guessing that after the success of Captain America Evans pleaded for an ""auteurs"" type project and the result is tiresome. We are taken on an insipid journey and into the crevasses of an infatuation process that will leave you ice cold and looking at your clock wishing it was over. The girl does a good job, Evans is not a bad actor but never ever give him the reigns again, to be a romantic lead versus doing an action hero takes a bit more talent.",Before We Go

Just because they laugh, it doesn't make the movie funny at all.
And this movie doesn't make any sense. First, you can clearly see that he is still into his old girlfriend and 30 min later he is head over hills with this new girl !! How???
You wait all night for something to happen and for the movie to actually start and make any sense and they hint that something dramatic is going to happen but nothing is happening at all.
And they have absolutely no chemistry at all.

By the end of their night the words ""Entitled whinger"" crept into my brain as her slight pout and dull eyes brought nothing. How true the words ""don't make a man your shrink"".

The movie is not the kind of romance that shows to have a marriage of happily forever after, but instead it shows the deepest life moments in such a few hours. Chris' acting was great and Alice's was good, but not so great since she had to use her American accent. The movie is also the first movie to be directed by Chris Evans, which is pretty cool to see. But to be honest, Before We Go is such a beautiful movie. It's very realistic to me, and it brought a message for me that one can actually love more than one person in this world.

81,milesd-94784,Not Before Sunrise,3,20 December 2016,"It's hard going into this review without at least mentioning the film(s) this lacklustre picture is blatantly attempting to rip off. Alas, I already have. Without going into plot details, this tells the story of two people meeting under somewhat contrived circumstances and are forced (by the script) to stay together for the rest of the run-time until they must part ways, back to their own humdrum lives. Sound familiar, well if you've had the pleasure of acquainting yourself with Richard Linklater's ""before"" trilogy then this may sound familiar.Although I think this film is a failure, it doesn't fail purely by the fact that it's a copy of another film, I dare say the films aren't all that similar in the first place. Rather this film fails to capture the fundamental essence of what this type of story is trying to tell. Mired in its tedious plot, it forgets to make interesting, complex characters. Moreover the characters they do have fail to make an interesting connection or melding of minds in a fleeting moment.Without any discernible qualities or traits or perspectives, why should I care about them? They don't talk about love and philosophy and politics and ambitions and things that they truly cared about and gender. No, they talk about Exes and marriage, and boy does they know how to drill a point home.Their hopes and ambitions wants and desires, begin and end within the 88-minute run-time. Before sunrise set up a real world and Jesse & Celine felt like they exist outside of the movie, in fact, the film itself feels like two people actually meeting and there just happened to be a camera pointing in their direction; the same cannot be said for whatshisface and whatsherface from this. This is in part due to their chemistry which is found wanting here, not for a lack of trying but I presume the screenwriter didn't cook the characters for too long or let them breathe. They merely feel like characters written for a movie and little more.Part of what made ""before Sunrise"" so special was that it didn't really have a plot, the characters didn't have anywhere to be particularly, in fact, they were trying to put off where they need to be. This allowed the film to be natural and accurately present life. Here is the opposite, they slink from contrived plot point to contrived plot point to reach a destination as some sort of catalyst for the characters to bond, which could work if the plot points made sense and the characters had something to bond over. Don't get me wrong if they removed this element then it would simply be a rip-off, but it does beg the question what is the point of the film, what is it trying to say? I can't answer that.There's more I can say about this film, it isn't shot terribly well; the plot is contrived giving excuses for the leads to stay together and there are really bad editing choices. But this is just an IMDb review; I'm not writing an article for the guardian and frankly, i don't care enough about the film to go in such depth.Ultimately the film just doesn't make me feel anything, the writing and chemistry are so bad I'm left confused as to how two competent actors fell so far short of the mark. Alas, this perfectly fits the definition of pretentious: trying to say something important and meaningful but not saying anything at all.",Before We Go

They delve into each of their personal issues along the way, but I just couldn't get past the premise being completely unbelievable and unrealistic, it was hard to get on board with the rest of the film, but nevertheless I sat through the whole thing. It's like they watched Before Sunrise and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (even stole a song from it) and tried to replicate the chemistry and complexity of those films and failed miserably. I would say avoid this movie at all costs and instead, watch either of those movies instead. Most notably, Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight if you are looking for this type of movie.

Spoiler
I was curious myself. I googled it but didn't find any useful answer. So I went to sleep and awoke with this possible interpretation in mind:First, think back to the scene where they were drawing on the back of the artwork at the hotel. Remember that we never got to see what they drew/wrote.In the end, as she is looking at the guest survey, and sees the arrow and instruction to ""turn over,"" she flips the card, and it looks like the word ""remember"" is there...I think he's reminding her that he has a message for her behind the artwork at the hotel (which she would also have to ""turn over"" to read). And of course to retrieve the message would mean another trip back to NYC, somehow acquiring or getting into that exact room, and hoping the message is still there.For two who seem to believe in serendipity, it's perfect. It leaves open the possibility of another adventure. And another adventure on top of that depending on what the message says.I'm pretty sure she'll take him up on the adventure.Anyway, that's my two cents.",Before We Go

Chris Evans does a wonderful job as the kind-hearted trumpeter who's helping stranded Alice Eve find her way back home, both literally and figuratively. The film nicely glides past the usual clichés to create a story and characters that represent the best of humanity. It's hopeful, but grounded in reality. The fact that Chris Evans directed and produced this was a pleasant surprise, but also not entirely surprising at all. He managed to successfully play a sincere superhero without any signs of a smirk and this movie demonstrates that he has even more layers to reveal.

It is funny, thoughtful (but not overdramatised), clever and sensitive at the same time. Finally a film where love, a man and a woman and the relationship between them is treated with respect, gentleness and is elevating, and refreshing. The script is great, the acting is superb, the dialogues, those subtle gestures, looks, smiles are all in place. Nothing overdone just treated with natural care.

98,carcinodevil,Heart warming.,7,18 August 2016,"*SPOILERS*This was an unexpected story to follow through with. Although some concepts came into question, the central dynamics that developed throughout the film with the characters was amusing as it was touching. For example, the protagonists didn't follow through with what the audience might initially expect (wife cheated, guy who takes advantage). Instead you find yourself with genuine characters who face struggles we all do, and the choices we force ourselves to make. It shows that sincerity can show itself in hopeless places too. It wasn't the typical romance movie I was expecting, nor was it going out of its way to do more than what it could. Chris Evans didn't disappoint as Nick, and offered more than just a pretty face to his character. There was emotion behind his fantastic directing as well; consider the scripts, the jokes, the so called life lessons, all that was shared between him and his apparent company. In the world of cliché movies, this one is worth watching. The ending was probably my favourite part. Really incredibly shot and the script here was amazing. Brooke kept walking all the way into the train, Nick kept smiling, she pulled out the feedback check, and the mystery behind his ""Turn Over"" became a thrilling end to a heart warming romance story!",Before We Go
99,rollora,Boring and meaningless,3,29 December 2015,"In short: his movie wasn't for me, although from the description it looked kinda promising. It may be a movie for you if you feel lonely and dream of a sort of romantic adventure with a stranger that isn't so strange after all. If you are in a relationship however (and are not trying to escape it in your mind ;) ) or are a person who goes out a lot and also from time to time flirts with another person, this movie will be kind of familiar to you and stupid at the same time, since the behavior of the characters towards each other, especially how rude the pretty girl is (she can do that in real life too I guess, she is pretty) is just annoyingThis is the first movie I turned off in the middle in a very long time. Why? Two strangers meet and spend the night together, going through some ""adventures"" (or what you may call it) and talking about what's wrong with their lives. So basically Friday/Saturday night of every person that still goes out and flirts around a bit.What I didn't like about the movie was that of course the characters are overly pretty and that must explain why the guy feels the need to win the girl over, although she is kinda harsh and jerkish to him from the beginning on for at least 20 minutes of the movie. I was watching it with my wife and we were wondering why he would be still trying to win her over if she treats him like that. Either he finds her hot, or he is really desperate.Well either way, then the movie goes on, nothing special happens. They have strangely unrealistic dialogs with a lot of things just letting unsaid, basically so the viewer has the hopes this will be said and explained later on. And those unsaid things are things no normal person would say in the real world (that is why 3/10, because of the creativity they must have put into the dialogs).Another thing that I hated about the movie: its 100% predictable. That may be because I was going out a lot when I was young and these stories happen all the time.Sorry for my bad English",Before We Go

Over the course of some hours, glances are taken (Brook's) and words are spoken (Nick's) in such a heartfelt manner, ultimately, giving way to the arising of new possibilities as a couple.Chris Evans' directorial debut is a gem of sensibility and commitment to the romantic genre, treating the viewer to an intimate perspective of two souls whose felicitous chance encounter has them looking at themselves and each other, while opening meaningful paths they never thought would be there to be taken.Evans and the gorgeous Alice Eve have great chemistry and play of each other beautifully, while never drawing attention to themselves. It's the message that matters, one that's eloquently delivered by this film.As a blind character said in a recent movie I watched: ""Every time you walk in this room you make me feel something I thought I never would again: possibilities."".

104,unpeazfool,An ex-Manhattan person watching this.,9,13 September 2015,"I have to say, I didn't have high expectations for the film going in. I really just love Alice Eve, I first saw her on the Late Show with Craig Ferguson and immediately had to see what she was all about. She has such an aura of positivity around her and I wanted to see if she can channel that in her acting - She did not disappoint.I actually ended up loving this film. As a person that's been through the ups and downs of love in Manhattan, I related to the characters so well. (Spoilers) I remember seeing my ex that I fell for in a bar in Manhattan for the first time with a different guy, and how it tore me apart. I remember having the courage to pump myself up and keep going out there and seeing that until I was okay with it. I remember finally coming to that point where I was okay with what happened. In a way, I wish both of those characters were there for me so I didn't have to do it all alone like I did. There was a part of this film where she said, ""I don't know how to come back from all the venom"" - and hit just hit home so hard. It's so strange as a guy to be heartbroke - in one hand you want to be macho and stop yourself from being such a wuss, in another you just want to sit there and tear up and feel sorry for yourself, then in another you're just angry, you want to let it out on someone and ""bash his face in."" Sometimes you make that last choice and you wish you hadn't. I remember why I wanted to go to Manhattan in the first place - because I honestly believe it was a city where dreams came true, that I would find the person I love and that I would be happy, this movie sort of reminded me of why, and beneath all that concrete, hard exterior that is NYC, there's a lot of people with a lot of soul just searching for their someone as well.

106,Filmnerd97,Debut excellence,7,23 July 2015,"This romance movie is Chris Evans' directorial debut which was first shown at Toronto international Film Festival.Brooke Dalton is a buyer and art enthusiast from London who misses the last train home from Boston, and gets robbed for her bag. She drops her phone and as she rushes towards the departing train. Forced to leave grand central station after it closes, she ends up meeting Nick Vaughan, a Bostoinian trumpet player who is due to go to an interview for the job of his dreams the next morning.Together they rush across Manhattan's lower east side to try and get home before Brooke's husband. Along the way they open up to each other about Nick's old relationship with Emma who he met while he was a sophomore in high school. Brooke also has relationship issues with her husband after discovering emails showing he is having liaisons with a woman called Liz. Brooke also tells Nick the reason she needs to get back is because she wrote a letter exposing evidence that she discovered while reading his emails to and from Liz along with her wedding ring. Nick is planning to confront his ex and make her jealous with his success in order to try and try and change their break up years ago when he planned to marry her. Brooke persuades him to go and they arrive and entertain wedding guests with a performance of ""My Funny Valentine"". Then they discover they're at the wrong place! Nick's friend Danny is contacted in a green room and then Nick tries booking into a hotel. Discovered that they aren't who they say they are at the hotel they go to the party and meet Nick's ex. Hannah is in a relationship with Cole and Nick figures out that his plan won't work bailing and walking away with Brooke. Along the way they find a physic and for fun have predictions even though Nick is a skeptic. Finally, Nick and Brooke get to the hotel and Nick kisses Brooke after all they've been through, which Brooke stops half way because it feels wrong to her. Then they travel to the station and Brooke waits for her train. Before getting on Brooke kisses Nick as a thank you.I thought that the story was quite unusual in terms of how Rom Coms usually play out rather banal because the man ends up convincing the woman to drop everything and be in a relationship. This time though, Nick and Brooke start as strangers and end up as connected somehow through their shared experiences. Chris Evans directing for the first time was quite interesting because I heard that he said he would definitely want to do some directing and take a break from acting. Especially as it seemed that he was getting pegged as either the hero, fanciable guy or main character who's point of view determines the story arc like in most of his filmography.I enjoyed the cameo of Chris' younger brother Scott who is also in the industry as an actor when he played the concierge of the hotel and I was amazed at the fact that the whole film took 19 days to shoot.I'd rate this film- ★★★★ because of the well thought out acting, defying the normal Rom Com tropes. Next time I'll look forward to Chris Evans as both an actor and director.",Before We Go
107,abhik-sengupta25,Vaguely Cute but Funny To Watch..,6,28 August 2015,"Before watching it, there were great speculation from my side that whether it would be one more movie trying to imitate 'Before Sunrise'. Honestly I am no one to judge that. The directorial debut of Chris Evans looked surprisingly promising. I really enjoyed the direction from the beginning till the end. The other element in the movie which really impressed me was the sound direction. Music by Christ Westlake plays its tone fantastically over the audience. Besides, the set up and every thing, what I felt within the movie that there were certain elements which seemed quite absurd. Firstly, using booth-phones just because the phone battery died? How hard is it to not find technology in 2014, especially. Other than that, at one point of the movie, Brook is shown greatly nervous and scared even after being offered help from Nick, and suddenly everything seems normal? I felt the connection between the actors lacked quite a bit. All this seemed vaguely cute, but apart from the minor flaws it was funny to watch it. Thankfully it did not defy to be a senseless Rom-Com which some might consider it.",Before We Go

Chris blew me away with this, so proud of him. And I hope to see him direct more films. I love the story, loved the performance, and it's just amazing because it's honest.I'd say that in comparison to romantic comedies like Crazy stupid love and movies about love like 500 days of summer, this one is a mix of the two. This movie teaches you about love through love in a way that is real and pierces your heart in a slow and melancholic way. Two individuals with their own realities and completely different lives meet each other in the most mundane yet surprising way. One has everything to loose and the other has nothing to loose yet they both relate to each others' stories like no one in their respective worlds would. The interaction between the characters is cute, yet filled with harsh segments of reality but at the same time it's heartwarming- like meeting an old friend. The conversation isn't made up with perfect phrases and sentences that will make you marvel over it's poetic delivery but it's real- like the ones you'd have with your nearest friends, where it's sometimes simple and sometimes beautifully raw and emotional. The actors did a wonderful performance.",Before We Go

He travels all over New York to find your wallet. He spends his money and listen to your husband's cheating and be your spiritual mentor. Chris Evans's directorial debut is a little fresh love film about two worried and tired young people meeting and spending a night together in New York. Many unique details are arranged in the plot, showing the contradiction between uncontrollable emotion and marriage, and we can only face and bear the consequences. Although it is an ideal story, I like the attitude of letting go when the final problem is not completely solved and the open ending. Chris Evans knew that so many fans liked him, but he couldn't reply one by one, so he directed such a film. Maybe when you see this movie 100 times, Nick (not Chris Evans) will come off the screen and come to you. Chris Evans is busy with his acting career, Captain America is busy saving the world, only Nick is the one who can walk with you.",Before We Go

First of all, I've seen Chris Evans grow into this ethereal/refined actor (London being his turning point, in my humble opinion) and I couldn't imagine he was going to do such a good job directing. I watched this expecting nothing cause I get disappointed easily, but if I had any kind of expectations, they would've been exceeded. The storyline is original - we all dream about meeting that one stranger that's going to turn your life around and end up finding a soul mate... but I've never seen it quite like this. It's a script that takes your heart on a little ride until it breaks a bit. You've found her/him, yet, they're not yours to keep. Ouch. But, it's an experience that'll live with you forever.

The storyline and the characters are interesting, as they are dealing with adult problems and 'the real world' while still getting involved in a romantic love story. Parts of this film that i did not like, were the cheesy lines and the sometimes too-perfect acting of Chris Evans. Especially the conversations to past selves on the public telephones were just too perfectly worded to be realistic. I also would've wished there would have been a more in-depth background story of the main characters, since we didn't get too them that well.

It is very different from the traditional love stories we are familiar with. There is no love at first sight, no convincing, no impressive showdown of charisma. It makes sense because it is realistic. It is a story of two people, who are in love but not with each other. Through their sorrows, experiences, fear, expectations and emotions, they found each other. The great thing about the film is how it was built. The film is mostly about two strangers out in the night in a city and their activities. There was not a single moment where the film started to get boring. The whole plot is so well written and it can be watched multiple times and every time it feels better. There is no way anyone will ever be able to hate Chris Evans after watching this film.

It is not a regular romantic story, that's for sure, its a romantic masterpiece with an oscar role well deserved by Chris Evans. The most characteristic thing about this movie is that it looks a bit like a document with a shaky operator hand, which makes it more realistic, natural, almost like you are watching the actions standing on the street next the them. Plus - these mimics, acting and looks these 2 main characters give to each other are simply stunning. One of the stories you can watch every few weeks and never get bored.

I love the directing in it. It was very loose and just radiates happy. You can really feel every emotion in it, that you don't really get from other romance movies. Most romance I like, but never love because you can't feel anything from it. ""Before We Go"" had me crying at the end. One of my favorite parts of the movie though would have to be the scenery and the feel you get from a photo of a scene. It's so beautiful and you can feel the emotions portrayed in the pictures. ""Before We Go"" can be hard for some people to like if they can't feel the emotion coming off the screen. It's full of heart and I loved watching every minute of it.

145,sweetlady-25,Why you should not shoot another indie film on love,2,5 February 2016,"""Why not"" , I can hear some say. The answer is the entirety of this film, which cannot escape being another suffocating, cheap indie with the bold and vain claim to the exaggerated virtue of sincerity. How many times do we have watch the unfolding relationships and lives of young, urban Americans? Many many times, it seems, if both the audience and the critics turn a blind eye to the bathos of a scenario for the sake of goodwill and the achievement of shooting a tolerably boring romance with a limited budget. I do not aim, however, my criticism at the director Chris Evans, who is naive enough to assume that we would fail to notice that he gets to act a most adorable young man you can see- who is adorable enough to propose to his girlfriend in his teens in the 21th century. Go on and keep watching these films about beautiful girls and lonely handsome boys, and do not forget to rate them as high as you possibly can for the sake of avoiding post- disappointment.",Before We Go
146,cenkkaratas,Not for adults,3,15 September 2015,"Definitely an attempt to create a ""heartwarming"" romantic comedy. Albeit promising at times, it falls short of delivering what it tries to deliver.Story has no peculiarities, nothing original. It is like a combination of every romantic comedy ever shot with an amateurish cinematography.A girl, a boy, lots of dialogue, and not very clever mostly cheesy jokes sprinkled around.Maybe a good choice for adolescent viewers to watch with their boyfriends&girlfriends. But slow, boring, and full of cliché for adults.No need to bother if you are not desperate to hold your date's hand, or if this is not the first romantic comedy you have ever seen.",Before We Go
147,ben_hayton,A powerful comparison between falling in love and living relationships,8,2 August 2016,"This film is exactly what you need when you think you've seen it all (in the romance genre). It can feel like you're perpetually caught between the all too cheesy 90s high school flicks and their modern day resurrections, the shameless happily-ever-afters, and the all too tragic wannabe indie types. Well here is a film that treats you like an adult. It's charming, but serious. Funny, yet insightful. Mind you-this isn't always what you want. In his new role as director, Chris Evans intentionally sets out to prove his credentials as more than a Marvel Superhero actor. In my opinion, he succeeds. As an ode to New York, this film is a fitting tale for 'the city that never sleeps'. The realistic portrayal of inner city nightlife can leave you feeling groggy. Like I said, you have to be in the right mood to properly enjoy this film. The undeniable sexual tension between the two protagonists is played against the complexity of their lives and pasts. Significantly, the protagonists understand that the world will not seamlessly adapt at their convenience. A key question posed throughout is whether the inevitable fallout should ever stop us from following our hearts. This film is, at its core, a refreshingly realistic exhibition of the idea that powerful feelings, even for the briefest of moments, have value in and of themselves. Although it may be hard to make a decision, especially one that compels us to face who we are, doing so and dealing with the consequences is what it truly means to grow up.",Before We Go

I love how the film exuded a sort of quiet, dreamy air. I entered the story feeling a little more than depressed, and left with a smile(maybe some tears too).

The characters are well thought out and believable. the camera work was first class and the music hit the right chords and fit in perfectly for the emotions he was trying to convey.

Both the characters were so perfect and the actors delivered perfection. You will not get bored throughout the movie although the movie revolves around two main characters.That was unexpected and an out of the box performance for me. The dialoges are so perfectly timed.The music too complements the movie. A simple storyline but definitely not the performance. Let me put it like this,""charming and refreshing"".The movie kind of gets on you as it goes. Before I go,let me tell, you'll love it.",Before We Go
157,tbscx,Not bad as critics say. Give it a try. You will love it.,8,24 August 2016,"This movie is in my watchlist for 8 months. And tonight it screamed to me. The movie cover said ""Watch me! Critics are wrong!"" And I watched it. The plot is there is a man and there is a woman and of course there is only one night. They stuck in their lives and both of them having a bad time. They met accidentally. They want to help each other. Thats all. Perfect plot for a drama movie because it is similar to 'Before Sunrise' (8.1 IMDb rating) and 'Once' (7.9 IMDb rating).""But there is something wrong with Before We Go"" thats what critics say. I think it is not bad as they say. I mean it doesn't deserves a 31 metascore. It should be 60+. And the Box Office of that film is very bad. I think Chris Evans did a good job at directing and Alice Eve fits the role perfectly. Before We Go's cinematography is not good as Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight but it is not bad. When it ends it gives you pain deep in your heart. Because of that I give the title 8/10. I mean I feel that. It touches your heart. You can feel pain, heartbreak, despair, passion and love in that movie. I remember a tagline from the movie ""Virgin Suicides"" it was 'Just Like Life'. I think that Before We Go is just like life too.",Before We Go
158,vyshnavwhitesnake,review,10,20 September 2015,"Chris Evan, you have been my favorite actors. I just love this movie. It reminded me the things which is happening in my life. It made me realize that even I have been loving a single person ever since she left me. Even I have been blindfolded, disgruntled about myself of being so naive in nature. Surely I haven't met any another person unlike you in the movie. But it showed that I can move on and bring light into my life and be happy. It been a struggle but I feel Its worth it and I have learned many thing from this love break.""We love who we love. Sucks."" that quotes seriously makes a big difference in the movie. Or else it could be the happy ending. But this was very realistic and life telling story. Thank you Chris Evan a lot for such a Beautiful movie. Good luck.",Before We Go
159,jokerr-26362,First try but not bad,8,10 September 2015,"It is first directed by Chris Evans for the first time. I think it is not bad in some kind of romance story like that. I hope Chris can make more possible in this movie. I saw many romance movie like this,it is not bad in this kind of movie. After watched,even through it doesn't make me cry,but it was a great story. Good try. Being a fan of Chris Evans, I went into BEFORE WE GO wanting to like it. In interviews he often expresses a desire to move behind the camera, with this being his directorial debut. While not an obnoxious film or an especially bad one, there's just nothing about it to latch on to, leaving it a hollow romance that feels like a pale imitation of Richard Linklater's BEFORE movies.",Before We Go

It shows many perspective of what relationship are like with friends, strangers, lovers, exes, etc. The real beauty of this film is that it tells you your true strength that you don't even know you have it. It is a beautiful movie, and not everything has to be about intimacy or lust or showing off you skin. Sometimes you need someone to talk to and share your feelings.

164,kal_el-71620,"""Poor Man's"" version of the cult classic ""Before Sunrise""",6,17 August 2015,"If you haven't seen this movie yet and you are interested in seeing it and would like to know the opinion first of people who have seen it before you actually watch it yourself, I'll make it simple for you. Imagine a movie with a storyline that's similar to ""Before Sunrise"". Then -- assuming you are a big fan of the ""Before..."" trilogy like me -- imagine how ""Before Sunrise"" would be if it was directed by a first timer like Chris Evans instead of the multi-awarded Richard Linklater. Then imagine again if the main characters were portrayed by another pair of young veteran Hollywood actors instead of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy. Now lastly imagine all of those elements put together in a movie that's similar to ""Before Sunrise"" BUT with VERY LITTLE of the chemistry that Hawke and Delphy produced on screen. One thing that was amazing about those Linklater movies was the undeniable on-screen CHEMISTRY of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy. And chemistry is something that can't be taught; it just comes out naturally. I'm sure that Evans & Eve tried their best but sadly they weren't able to produce that on-screen chemistry that is essential in every romance film. I think the biggest mistake Evans made in his directorial debut was doing a movie similar to ""Before Sunrise"" because in the end, viewers were left with no choice but to compare his directing to Linklater & his acting to Hawke. And he pales in comparison to both---if he is to be judged based on this movie alone.Although Evans still has a long way to go as a director (and actor, too), I'd give him a passing rate for ""Before We Go"".",Before We Go

I never have seen this actor before, but he was so good. The movie felt so real. I really could feel every emotion.. From joy to sadness. From intimacy to separation. It's a movie with a night full of surprises. If you are looking for an action movie or something, you shouldn't watch this movie. This is a movie with a lot of love and that will reflect the emotions you could have in real life into a movie. I am 100 percent sure I will watch this movie many more times.",Before We Go

They spend a night together trying to get the girl home to her husband. Chris Evans is the charming romantic guy that you expect him to be. Alice Eve is the the conflicted woman meeting a stranger but wanting to save her marriage. At the end of the day, what happens is what should happen. The hopeless romantic in me says these two people spent so many hours together for a reason and I can't hate it. For it to be Chris Evans's directorial debut I can't hate it either. Oscar worthy, obviously not but worth watching for those who love a sweet love story, absolutely.",Before We Go

After watching the movie i felt satisfied and wondering what was on the back of the card, which leave the audience wondering, which makes this movie great.After watching the movie, i took a look at the trailer. The trailer was misleading and gave the wrong expectation the movie was suppose to be. The trailer made it seem like it would be a romantic comedy where the two people would fall in love.

Alice and Chris both did a great acting job, especially Chris who is also debut director of this masterpiece. Well done guys, this movie is such a refreshment and most likely it will be for a while. I'm putting it in my own personal hall of fame as I'm writing this review. And yes peeps, these things, they happen in real life too, just don't sit and wait for it. Although your stranger at the train station lost deep inside her thoughts probably won't be Alice Eve, don't ignore her. Stop for a moment and give her a hand, ask her how she feels, maybe you'll experience an adventure of a lifetime. Collect moments, not things, life is way too short guys.",Before We Go

It's different- deeper, and oh so good! Super impressed by the leads and think it's just the ticket for anyone looking for a romance. It's one that I'd recommend to girlfriends for sure. I actually can say I loved this movie. There were times I was so into it that I had a giant frozen grin on my face and my husband looked over and said ""you're lovin this... It's right up your alley."" If you're the type that's turned on by true romantic connection, consider this your emotional porn.

I have seen similar films in the past but for whatever reason, ""Before We Go"" hit me deep. Part way through, I found myself truly reflecting on my own life and realzing that I have never been in love. Soon after, I also relfected upon why I haven't found love or what I could be doing wrong in my life that would push love away. This movie made me wish I could feel the pain that love brings just so I know what love really is. I ended the movie wishing I could go out and find love of my own, only to arrive on the realization that love will find me. Don't know when, where, or with who.

178,jiruizc,How I interpreted the end ... ( Warning Spoilers ),10,23 April 2021,"I just watched this movie and had to visit this site for the reviews trying to find different points of view for the great ""open"" ending ...
First I want to say how great the way the characters slowly begin to evolve and make you feel you're in the front row of the show.As a man I felt the story like a glove to my hand in the sense that we as men we have to go over these things like getting in danger or getting punch in the face to defend or help the women we want to be with even if is not in a complete romantic way at first maybe just for company and trust before we even get to know much about her.Makes me remember when I dated different ex's in the past and all the things I went through to be worthy of their trust. When the best one: "" my wife"" was an effortless series of perfect chemistry bonded with trust that evolved into a family of four.The ending is open for interpretation and each one of us can have a different ending for it ...
Mine is based on experience even though I'm romantic I'm also realistic
And this is what I interpreted at the end :
They had a memorable night, one I which they bonded beyond expectations and experience feelings they had no plans for. At the end reality hits first Brooke she is in love with her husband , the way they talked over the phone seems like they care for each other and even if he cheated in her mind for the months knowing the situation she puts on the balance how the good moments are far more important than a mistake and she is going to try work things out with her husband. She tells this to Nick. In the other hand Nick is hooked up to the feeling that she might be an opportunity to give love another chance in his life but he also knows that whatever he says or does he needs to wait and let her go. At the end I think she works her relationship with her husband and holds Nick as a memory she will never forget. While Nick with time realizes that it was just a memorable night and he felt in love with the idea of the ""what if ? Or ""what could it be ? "" then he moves on and finds true love later and enjoys the struggle of sharing a life with his soulmate.The End.George Ruiz..........

Was not a fan on the first few minutes nor actress but as the movie continued to unfold, I enjoyed the realism of actors and I think that was the aim of the movie. Did not initially enjoy Alice Eve's character but grew to really like her. I think the movie depicted the nature of story and actors how it intended.It was a beautiful movie and enjoyed quite much I would recommend for viewers to watch the movie as is and not be quick to jump.

181,greenmbc,"""Before We Go"": The independent film you didn't know you needed this Valentine's day",7,23 February 2017,"""Before We Go"" is an unexpected gem in the countless independent romances featured on Netflix this valentine's season. This film highlights the softer side of America's favorite hero Chris Evans, who starred as the main actor, producer, and debuted his talents as a director. The film features two strangers struggling with relationship problems on their own who by coincidence find each other at their greatest time of need. The movie portrays romance and relationships that aren't just about sex and attraction, something that is overrated in the romance genre right now.The film manages the heartwarming tone of a traditional romance film, despite a plot based on heartbreak. The warm connection of the characters really boosts the overall feeling of the film. The subtle romance creates a hopeful and heartfelt experience that overcomes the underlying sad tones. The quick-moving nature of the plot made the film exciting and grasping to the audience. A subtle, yet vital, part of the light tone is the quirkiness of the characters, that makes a fun and innocent feeling, such as the characters pretend phone calls to their past selves.The film went in an interesting direction for a romance movie, in that the movie isn't about sex or attraction. The romance between the characters isn't sexual, it's emotional. The characters are both experiencing a difficult time emotionally and their deep trust, honesty, and connection help them learn from each other and overcome their challenges and in the process built a deep relationship.A struggle Evans faced as director was building the all the dynamics of the film without overwhelming the plot line. The film takes place over the course of one night and the movie runs for just over an hour. During that short period, the plot rapidly jumps between locations with little transition, making for a disorienting experience. The overwhelming number of locations was evident in the three wedding scenes, two train station scenes, a bus station scene, and many other scenes. The story got real confusing quickly.The actors gave a stunning performance; the feel couldn't have been more natural. As expected Evans played his role as Nick with grace and depth. Alice Eve, too, was spectacular in her role as Brook. The acting styles between her and Evans merged well and together created the perfect, cute romantic feeling of the film. ""Before We Go"" is an unexpectedly well-made film that reached levels of the emotional spectrum that traditional romance typically doesn't dare to go, and brings a heartwarming look at the struggle and growth of the characters. The plot is dense but still, the movie is an enjoying experience. This film is a Valentine's day must see.",Before We Go

185,music-96393,Perfect movie,10,11 September 2017,"""Before We Go"" is an amazing movie. So much, that I chose THIS movie to write my very first review! While you're seeing these two beautiful strangers slowly begin to unravel to one another, you also get that sense of mystery waiting to unravel too. It has the right amount of drama and excitement/adventure, while also kindling into a deeper feeling of romance and love. This is the kind of movie that takes you away...and isn't that why we all watch them? Perfect choice for the main roles too, especially giving credit to Chris Evans being the director and star! At one point in the movie he says,""Why is it that any one decision always seems too small to be the biggest decision of your life?"" This allows us as the viewers to relate in different aspects of our own lives as individuals. To me, this puts all of who I am and where I am in life on a broad spectrum based off of decision making and allows me to evaluate and reminisce. Then SHE says, ""I don't need to know my future, I'm gonna live it anyway."" When we tend to stress every ounce of the future, and so I again (personally), took that as reminder to relax..Then she further says,""You don't have to believe it for it to make an impact."" (Speaking in the aspect of seeing a psychic)...this goes alongside with a theory of subliminal messages that are real but not by choosing them to be. Ex; Like having a best friend tell you something negative about your significant other, and you don't want to face whatever it was that was said. Another eye opening quote. And the last one I want to point out is the psychic himself. He said,""You can't allow the people you love, to determine how you love."" Think about that...hits the spot! What I'm trying to say is that there are so many things to learn and endure from this movie on many levels. Each time there is an idea to fix the criticical issue she is having, they all seem to end up failing...So they're struggling, but finding that love is ""choosing who you want to struggle WITH"" sets into play. The ending initially made my heart drop once i realized it was over because it's a cliffhanger! After watching though, I'm sure we all get the picture! Overall, I give ""Before We Go"" a 10..it was simply? ...enchanting.",Before We Go
