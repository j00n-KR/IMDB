0,TheLittleSongbird,The worst King Kong,4,5 June 2011,"I adore the 1933 film and liked the 2005 remake, but while I don't hate this I dislike it. The cinematography, sets and most of the costumes are good, the music is decent, Jeff Bridges does what he can in his role and succeeds and I loved King Kong's ape face(if not his costume) as it did look great. However, the film is overlong and filled with pointless exposition that goes absolutely nowhere, while on the whole the entire Skull Island sequence is uneventful and devoid of tension, mystery and atmosphere. The script may be grittier and more cynical, but some of the dialogue is also so bad it makes you cringe, Charles Grodin and Jessica Lange get the worst of it. The story is poorly paced and dull, while I felt nothing for the characters and didn't believe at all in the contrived romance. Apart from Bridges the acting is very bland, Charles Grodin is more annoying than funny, Jessica Lange is very sexy but her performance is marred by insipid dialogue and a poorly written character and King Kong is little more than a man in a cheap giant ape suit and there were times when I found him creepy(in a bad way) rather than lovable and poignant. In conclusion, for me despite Bridges and other decent aspects this is the worst King Kong movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox",King Kong
1,Leofwine_draca,Redundant remake,5,10 March 2012,"It sure is hard to get too enthused about this rather redundant remake of the 1930s original. Made by Dino de Laurentiis in the mid-70s, when the craze for explosive disaster epics was at its peak, KING KONG suffers in comparison to the original in every respect. The script feels slow and stilted, and the film is way overlong, playing out an all-too-familiar story at boring length.It doesn't help that Kong himself is so laughable. Played by Rick Baker in a gorilla suit, he's chucklesome even at the most serious of times (although thank goodness they didn't go with the clunky Carlos Rambaldi model which appears for one brief instant during Kong's escape). The dominating presence of a guy in a suit for most of the film brings to mind the old Toho Godzilla films, to which this is closely linked. Yet those Japanese movies are fun, action-packed and entertaining, for the most part everything that KING KONG isn't.I don't know why Jessica Lange (in her gorgeous debut) was asked to play one of the biggest bimbos ever put in a mainstream movie, but it really doesn't pay off. Jeff Bridges, as the activist/hippy lead, is hardly sympathetic either, and Charles Grodin's corporate bad guy is never evil enough to be truly hissable. Too many of his scenes are played for laughs, and I couldn't help recalling MIDNIGHT RUN. What does that leave on the acting front? A few familiar faces in minor roles – Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Ed Lauter, John Lone – none of whom have enough screen time to make much of an impact.Of course, the larger-than-life storyline is still interesting – how could it not be? – and I enjoyed the different, then-topical slants to the script, such as the debate on conversation vs. exploitation. Despite my preference for the '30s stop-motion model, I always enjoy watching monsters tearing up the skyline, and scenes like the one where Kong derails a train are inherently entertaining. But there's no forgetting that this is a silly, dated remake, one that's inferior in every respect to the '30s movie which, like Kong, dwarfs everything else in comparison.",King Kong
2,SnoopyStyle,passable remake at best,5,22 July 2015,"Oil executive Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin) leads an expedition to a cloud shrouded island in the Indian Ocean. He thinks the cloud is from huge deposits of hydrocarbons. Primate paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) stowaway on the ship and tells them that the cloud is caused by an unseen creature. On the way to lock up Prescott, they rescue unconscious starlet wannabe Dwan (Jessica Lange) on a life raft. Wilson brings Prescott and Dwan on shore. They are confronted by a primitive tribe who then kidnaps Dwan to be sacrificed to the great ape.I like the change of the expedition to oil exploration. However they kept Dwan as a flaky starlet. Jessica Lange is absolutely beautiful and she's funny at times. However she's way too flighty and I can see criticism of her acting. I guess it's impossible back in the day to have her be a scientist. Nevertheless it's stupid to have her be literally the damsel in distress. The special effects are basically an ape suit and well shoot cinematography. The giant ape hand looks way too mechanical. The best part is King Kong rolling the tree. While it's great to have the World Trade Center, the movie doesn't take full advantage of its height to instill fear. This is a passable light weight remake at best. It just has too many problems to be great.",King Kong
3,Hitchcoc,It Was Certainly Fun...Minnesota's Own Jessica Lange,7,21 December 2016,"We so fondly remember the classic 1931 film with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray. This is pretty much the same movie, in color, with different motivations, using modern iconic structures (the World Trade Centers). But it all gets down to the invasion of an island by outsiders where a primitive tribe continues to sacrifice young women to a god (King Kong). Unfortunately, the gorgeous young Jessica Lange, who has been picked up on the open sea (certainly one of the great cinematic contrivances), is captured and about to become a snack for the big monkey. Along the way, Kong falls in love with her. Maybe he saw the original movie and Fay was a bit long in the tooth. Lange is rescued and the big gorillas strapped to an empty oil tanker and brought to New York where he is going to be exhibited for big bucks. Well, hope many horror stories have you seen. I'm not going to spoil the fun, but nature takes its course. It's not a bad movie. It just doesn't have any surprises.",King Kong
4,claudio_carvalho,"Flawed, But Watchable Debut of Jessica Lange",6,21 April 2006,"The owner of the oil company Petrox Corporation, Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin), invests all his possessions searching oil in an unexplored island. The vessel leaves Surubaya, in Indonesia, with the stowaway Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), who wants to protect an ape called Kong. While traveling, they find the castaway Dwan (Jessica Lange) in the middle of nowhere in a rescue boat in the ocean and bring her on board. The group finds that the island is inhabited and the local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong. They abduct Dwan to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. The crew hikes into the jungle trying to rescue Ann. King Kong falls in love for Ann and protects her against a huge serpent. When Fred finds that the oil in the island is not ready for exploitation, he decides to capture Kong and bring to New York for exhibition. In the middle of a show, King Kong escapes, goes to the World Trade Center bringing panic to the locals.In the last days, I saw Peter Jackson's remake of ""King Kong"" and the 1933 masterpiece. I have just seen this 1976 version again for comparison. The 1976 version of King Kong is flawed, with very poor special effects and many mistakes. For example, the arrangement of a tanker, with accommodation quarters, galleys and machinery spaces adjacent to the bulkhead of a cargo tank is totally impossible. Then Dwan is trying to escape from Kong in the wood, the chains clink, but later the sound stops. But the screenplay at least adapts the story to the present days (in 1976), and it is not a pure and simply copy of the original screenplay, like Peter Jackson's remake. Jessica Lange is extremely hot and explored in her debut in the silly character of Dwan, who stays partially naked most of the time, inclusive in a vessel crowded of men. Jack Prescott, the character of Jeff Bridges, looks like a lunatic. This movie gives also an opportunity to see the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Nevertheless, this version is watchable and entertains. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""King Kong""",King Kong
5,gavin6942,"Honestly, I Think This Is The Best Kong Film",7,20 May 2011,"A petroleum exploration expedition comes to an isolated island and encounters a colossal giant gorilla.While certainly one has to give credit to the original 1933 film, I actually think this one succeeds in ways that one did not. Sure, some of it is cheesy (the ape suit is not very believable), but it brings the film to modern times. The oil company angle was interesting, and the references to ""Deep Throat"" were, um, interesting...I know at the time there was a complaint that the Empire State Building was changed to the World Trade Center. Now, I guess there are two ways I can look at this. The part of me that prefers homages says that the Empire State Building was the only real proper choice. But now, seeing the film in 2011, I have to say that capturing the World Trade Center on film is a bit more historic -- though they could not have known that at the time.Oscar award-winning Jeff Bridges is excellent as always, here playing a liberal archaeologist or anthropologist or something like that. He seems to be a jack of all trades, smuggling himself on board and being useful at countless moments (and yes, his name is appropriately enough Jack). The hair and beard give him that ""Dude"" look, and I can never get enough of that.Last comment: Jessica Lange, what the heck? I have never before and will never again find her attractive. But here, she wins me over. And the rumor is that Barbra Streisand could have received the part? Yuck! Lange was the right choice, by far... and what a way to start a career.",King Kong
6,lee_eisenberg,"Look people, it made a star out of Jessica Lange...",5,1 January 2006,"Usually, this ""King Kong"" has been regarded with some scorn, do to it going a little overboard on being environmentalist and feminist. But still, it's a pleasant romp. As Kong's bride Dwan, Jessica Lange looks pretty hot in that outfit, and as hero Jack Prescott, Jeff Bridges looks like the ultimate hippie; as unctuous Fred Wilson, Charles Grodin makes a really nasty character. Clearly this version was very much a product of the '70s, but that's no crime. It's sort of strange to see the big guy scaling the World Trade Center, knowing what happened to it on 9/11. I still have yet to see Peter Jackson's version (I've heard mixed things about it).",King Kong
7,jboothmillard,King Kong,1,4 January 2009,"From director John Guillermin (The Towering Inferno), this remake is nowhere near as good as the 1933 original masterpiece. For one thing, it changes the whole reason to go to the mysterious island, the guy in charge, Fred Wilson (Beethoven's Charles Grodin), is instead looking for a new source of oil, the male lead Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) is a stowaway, and the lead girl Dwan (introducing Golden Globe winning Jessica Lange) is a castaway actress who escaped a sinking ship. Anyway, they get to the island, surrounded by fog, find the tribe, who offer her for sacrifice, and along comes their god Kong (played by special effects artist Rick Baker), who takes away, and starts falling in love with her. Another change is the battle with a T-Rex, it is instead a giant snake and is over pretty quickly. The oil they find by the way couldn't be used, so they instead caught Kong, and plan to exploit him as a promotional gimmick for the oil company. Kong escapes, after seeing Dwan being mobbed by reporters, there is a little chase, and Dwan lets him take her, and he climbs one of the World Trade Center/Twin Tower buildings, the final big change. Eventually he is attacked by flame throwers and then helicopters, and being fatally injured he falls his death (although there is a sequel 10 years later, King Kong Lives, where he is just in a coma). Oh, and there's no final quote about beauty and the beast! Also starring John Randolph as Captain Ross, René Auberjonois as Roy Bagley, Ed Lauter as Carnahan, Mario Gallo as Timmons, Jorge Moreno as Garcia, Jack O'Halloran as Joe Perko and Live and Let Die's Julius Harris as Boan. Rick Baker, best known for special effects in An American Werewolf in London, the Thriller video, Ed Wood, The Nutty Professor, The Grinch and Planet of the Apes (2001) playing Kong is very curious, especially seeing his facial expressions, so sleazy, ridiculous giant hands and giving a ""blow job"" (blowing to dry Lange off). Bridges is the wrong man, Lange is very cheesy, and you have to remember it was her first film, and she still won a Golden Globe, and the film itself, as soon as Kong arrives, it goes down hill all the way, and to be honest, you are relieved when he finally dies. Bizarrly this won the Special Achievement Award for visual effects at the Oscars, and it was nominated Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Production Design/Art Direction, it should have surely got some Razzies. Poor!",King Kong
8,Woodyanders,"A valiant, if not altogether successful attempt at doing a very 1970's version of the 1930's classic",7,20 June 2017,"An expedition to find oil on a remote tropical island discovers a giant ape (simian expert Rick Baker in a pretty convincing gorilla suit) instead.Director John Guillermin gives this picture an impressive sense of scope, keeps the enjoyable story moving along at a steady pace, and stages the exciting climax atop the World Trade Center with flair and skill. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s bright, but uneven script cleverly updates the premise with then timely and topical references to the oil crisis, the porno chic fad, the astrology craze, and the feminist movement which now date the movie in a charming way as well as offers the inspired touch of reducing Kong to a commodity that's crassly exploited by a greedy major corporation. However, the campy humor produces more groans than laughs while the variable special effects are strictly hit or miss throughout (Kong's dramatic entrance rates as a definite rousing highlight while his fight with a huge fake snake fails to pass muster).Fortunately, the sturdy acting by the fine cast helps a lot: A hirsute Jeff Bridges contributes a likable performance as decent and humane hippie paleontologist Jack Prescott, Jessica Lange makes an appealing cinematic debut as the sweetly ditsy Dwan, and Charles Grodin pours on the slimy snark as smarmy and unscrupulous oil company executive Fred Wilson, plus there are sound supporting contributions from John Randolph as the venerable Captain Ross, Rene Auberjonois as nerdy scientist Bagley, Julius Harris as the tough Boan, Jack O'Halloran as the dim-witted Joe Perko, Dennis Fimple as the goofy Sunfish, and Ed Lauter as the gruff Carnahan. John Barry's majestic orchestral score hits the stirring spot. Richard H. Kline's sumptuous widescreen cinematography provides a breathtaking glossy look. By no means a perfect film, but certainly not anywhere near as bad as its undeservedly poor reputation suggests.",King Kong
9,rmax304823,Kong Gets Botox Treatment,6,13 November 2010,"It seems as if they now intend to remake this once every generation or so, figuring that the new younger audience is so ignorant, so lacking in interest of anything beyond their own body sheaths, that they won't realize they're watching a remake. And why should they? The stars will be different, the special effects improved, the gore increased, perhaps more nudity. Well, maybe not the nudity. We want to appeal to twelve-year old minds so we have to get them in the theaters. At this point I'm no longer sure it's possible to make another successful movie about an untamed brute savagely stalking through the streets of New York unless it's a biography of Donald Trump.The original, which appeared in the early 1930s, had something important going for it, both from an artistic and a commercial perspective. It was an ORIGINAL. Somebody dreamed it up after multiple tokes on a long pipe. Everything since then, including ""Mighty Joe Young,"" has been merely an adaptation. Update the issue and the dialog, introduce some current slang, mix, and serve at room temperature.This isn't original but it's not bad either, taken as a good example of how to update a classic. Not an easy job. (Today, Charles Foster Kane would have to be a Rupert Murdoch figure.) Jeff Bridges has long hair and a beard and spouts eco-speak. Kong's capture and removal from the island leaves him chagrined. They've ruined the island and its natives by robbing them of their god. Soon they'll be no more than burned out drunks. In the original, Bruce Cabot in the same role had no such problem. That's what I mean by ""updating."" Similarly, the succulent Jessica Lang, as ""Dwan,"" aspiring movie star, is into astrology and feminism -- already on their way to obsolescence by 1975. Fay Wray had a coincidental wardrobe malfunction when surfacing in the water after her monumental drop from the top of a cliff. Here, Kong's fingertip seems to deliberately pull down Lang's the top of her elasticized native dress, not that any forbidden body parts are glimpsed, only hinted at. (Where did they get the elastic? No matter. The point is not the elasticity of Lang's dress but the elasticity of her bosom.) Charles Grodin is not Robert Armstrong, showman and human being. He's a corporatist monster, greedy, ambitious, and sniveling.It would be nice if the ecological message were to register with viewers but I'm afraid most viewers, as of the time I write this, will dismiss his concerns as so much elitist paranoia. After all, he's from Princeton and knows how to spell, so his distress is easily dismissed as elitist baloney.Critics at the time were disappointed in the film. They had been promised computer-generated visual effects and here, most of the time, as far as they could tell they were given only a man in a well-done gorilla suit. They must have had their fill of CGIs by now.",King Kong
10,ma-cortes,Updating from beauty and beast myth with an enjoyable giant ape,6,26 March 2008,"This remake from known story was previously adapted in the classic film(1933) by Ernerst B Schoedsack and Merian C Cooper and posteriorly remade numerous times, it concerns about an oil company whose owner (Charles Grodin, in the role of Robert Amstrong) travels on board vessel with a diverse crew(John Randolph, Ed Lauter, Jack Halloran,Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris), towards remote island near of Indonesia. In the ship stowaway Prescott(Jeff Bridges, in similar role of Bruce Cabot) and find the castaway Dwan(Jessica Lange, in the role of Fay Wray). In the foggy island encounter to Kong, an enormous gorilla, worshipped by the natives, then Kong falls in love with starlette Dwan, the genuinely touching heroine. Being captured, is brought to civilization and transported to New York City as sideshow attraction. Kong escapes, causing wreak havoc and rampage throughout the city ; ending up on top of the newly built World Trade Center substituting to Empire State Building from the classic version. Ultimately, Kong battling armored helicopters with machine gun.Lavish production by Dino De Laurentiis is long on budget , short on credibility. Spectacular and emotive scenes, including one where Kong strips Lange and an erotic shower with original drying. Problems lingered on the set and at a high cost, it was one of the most expensive movie of its time and took time to finish. Jessica Lange film debut(at 27 years old), she didn't again for three years but she was not glad her acting. Appear uncredited with brief acting, someone almost extra, Corbin Bersen, John Lone, John Agar and Joe Piscopo.Glittering and colorful cinematography by Richard H Kline, won deservedly Academy Award nomination. Sensible and touching musical score by John Barry. At the end the producer De Laurentiis wishes to acknowledge that Kong has been designed and engineered by Carlo Rambaldi, constructed by Carlo Rambaldi and Glen Robinson, with special contributions by Rick Baker. They utilized every possible form especial effects, it reveals the genius of its creators. The picture still holds up well after more than thirty years.

11,BA_Harrison,"It could have been worse, as Peter Jackson proved 29 years later.",6,14 August 2009,"Director John Guillerman's updated version of the classic monster story sees petroleum giant Petrox mounting an expedition to the legendary Skull Island in the hope of discovering new oil deposits. Seizing a chance for a free trip to the supposed home of a mythical giant ape, paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) stows away on board, and the expedition is also joined midway by beautiful castaway Dwan (Jessica Lange), who is found drifting in a life-raft after a violent storm sinks the yacht she was travelling on.On arriving at the island, the explorers do indeed discover oil, but also find that the island is inhabited by a savage tribe who worship an ape god named Kong, and they want Dwan to be his bride, whether she agrees to the ceremony or not...Jaws might have been the first ever summer blockbuster, but it was this 1976 remake of King Kong that turned a mere movie into an 'event': I can clearly recall the hype, the build-up, and the excitement that preceded its release, and on seeing the film, I remember being absolutely enthralled. Admittedly, I was only 8 at the time, and any trip to the cinema was an experience, but this was Kong, and as far as I was concerned, he ruled!Unfortunately, critics weren't quite as happy with Guilllerman's version of the great ape adventure as I was: the movie was panned, and was even considered a flop despite making bags of cash. On re-watching the film, I now recognise the flaws in the script, the inadequacies of the effects, and the silliness of the dialogue, but overall, I gotta say that I still find this film a lot of fun-not as much as the '33 original (of course), but certainly more than Peter Jackson's recent bloated, three hour long exercise in excess.Guillerman's direction is solid without being too showy, his cast are likable enough (although Lange's ditzy Marilyn Monroe style performance does irritate at times), the plot modifications are bearable given the contemporary setting, and the beautiful cinematography, by Richard H. Kline, not only delivers some breathtaking shots of the stunning locales, but also makes the most of Rick Baker and Carlo Rambaldi's ape effects. From a distance, Kong does look rather iffy-clearly a man in a monkey suit-but the close ups are incredible, with the creature displaying a remarkable range of expressions and emotions; the scene where Kong dries his woman after a waterfall shower is particularly impressive, with the cheeks puffing up and the lips blowing air over an appreciative Lange.As far as excitement is concerned, don't expect too much from the island based action-the famous tree scene is kinda disappointing, and Kong only gets to wrestle one rather rubbery snake-but once our massive primate gets to New York, the really good stuff kicks in: after Kong has broken free from his cage, he gets to play havoc with the subway, goes for a swim in the Hudson, scales the World Trade Centre, is attacked by flamethrowers, leaps from one tower to another, and trashes a couple of helicopters. Then he is shot to pieces and falls to the ground.As time has passed, people have gradually come to accept that this attempt at re-filming King Kong isn't as terrible as it was originally painted to be. And if you've seen the other two versions, you might as well see this one as well; you never know, you might enjoy it!",King Kong
12,moonspinner55,"Not a threat to the 1933 version, but not bad...",6,14 September 2021,"Expedition team on an island in the Indian Ocean discovers a gigantic gorilla. Worthy remake of the 1933 classic doesn't quite have the heart of the original, although newcomer Jessica Lange is a terrific update of the Screaming Mimi (she takes a tougher, more ballsy approach to the part and is quite fetching). Screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr. Had a lot to live up to, but he does a very decent job introducing the new characters. Still, memories of the original Kong and Fay Wray are tough to abandon. Two Oscar nominations: for Best Sound and Richard H. Kline's cinematography. The special effects team received a Special Achievement Oscar for their work.

13,BandSAboutMovies,Hype!,4,26 March 2021,"Movies get hyped today, but no movie in my experience has ever been hyped like King Kong. I was four years when it came out, a total monster kid, and it arrived at the most perfect time ever in my life, a time when I had no school, no work and only limitless time to obsess over the modern version of King Kong climbing the World Trade Center towers instead of the Empire State Building. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis and directed by John Guillermin (The Towering Inferno, King Kong Lives) with effects by Carlo Rambaldi (E. T., A Lizard in a Woman's Skin, Planet of the Vampires, A Bay of Blood and many more), this movie was on everything - glasses from Burger Chef, clothing, even a Jim Beam cocktail! Written by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., the man whose words brought Batman to the small screen and Flash Gordon to the big one, this movie was born in controversy. That's because the idea to remake King Kong - not the biggest idea in the world, it was the original blockbuster - was ABC executive Michael Eisner, who pitched the idea to Universal Pictures CEO Sidney Sheinberg and Paramount Pictures CEO Barry Diller. Dino De Laurentiis heard this, got the rights from RKO - to be fair, parts of the story were public domain - and hired Semple and Guillermin* to get the movie done fast. Before the movie was released, Universal sued De Laurentiis and RKO for breach of contract and started making their own remake that they were calling The Legend of King Kong, which would have been directed by Joseph Sargent (Jaws: The Revenge). More lawsuits flew and everything was settled by January of 1976 so that the movie could finally be released. To take Dino's side, he always claimed that he always wanted to make Kong because his daughter had a poster up in her room that he saw every morning. When Diller asked him to make a monster movie, he went right to remaking the 1933 classic. With a cast that included Jeff Bridges as hero Jack Prescott, Jessica Lange as the heroine Dwan and Charles Grodin as Petrox Oil Company executive Fred Wilson, this was a movie inside the 70's and the worries of the fuel crisis. Seeing it as a kid, I realized the first time that I'd been overwhelmed by hype that could never be lived up to. That said, subsequent rewatches have been more enjoyable. I kind of wish Hammer had made their version. Some of the footage shows up in a Volkswagen** commercial with animation by Ray Harryhausen (O'Brien's assistant) Jim Danforth and David Allen (the men who made Equinox!). It also features Fay Wray's daughter as Anne Darrow! Supposedly, RKO never wanted to remake King Kong when Hammer approached them. Yet as I get older, I have to shout ""Che palle!"" to Dino, who told Time, ""No one cried when Jaws died, but when the monkey dies, people are gonna cry. Intellectuals are gonna love Kong. Even film buffs who love the first Kong are gonna love ours. Why? Because, I don't give a crap.""*He originally wanted Roman Polanski. Michael Winner and Sam Peckinpah were also asked and man, I want to see the King Kong they would have made.",King Kong
14,sunwarrior13,A Fair Remake,7,4 December 2014,"King Kong is a remake of the 1933 classic of the same title that tells the story of a about a giant ape that is captured and imported to New York City for exhibition. It features Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange in her first film role.When an extraordinary giant-sized ape is discovers in Skull Island,a paleontologist was assigned into capturing him so that it can be arranged for public display and exploitation.But when a beautiful woman was shipwrecked on the said island,she is kidnapped by the ape and the get attracted to her.When the woman was rescued,King Kong decides to go to New York and wreak havoc into the city to seek Dwan again.The city was placed into danger until he faced his demise on the Wolrd Trade Center.Obviously,the Dino De Laurentiis production is a straightforward remake with modern special effects, and naturalistic performances by the actors as compared to the 1933 version.But the performances of the cast was somewhat funny and so is the screenplay despite the fact that it does not intend to be.Obviously,Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange became better as both moved on to become Oscar winners and talented performers after their somewhat comedic participation in the film.Overall,it may not be a good film but it manages to have better special effects compared to the original due to De Laurentiis and the advancement in film technology.",King Kong

16,hitchcockthelegend,"No, you're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives, and the magic.",5,12 June 2019,"1976. I had already been spellbound and terrified by Jaws the year previously, I mean I was only 10 years old. Having been introduced by my film loving parents to the original King Kong from 1933, as soon as this update - in colour - was released, I stood in that queue for two hours to see it. I was spellbound once again, absolutely loved it, telling everyone in school or on the playing fields how great the experience was. Those things never leave you, it's love of cinema with youthful eyes, and none of us should ever decry those moments as being ignorance.Much later in life, watching this reworking of the Kong story becomes a battle to not extinguish those youthful fires. For now you can see just how poor the effects are, in fact just how much of a cheat (through research) that uber producer Dino De Laurentiis was as he put this onto the screen. Conversely, though, you can now see just how adult much of it was. The pic is full of sexual connotations and imagery. I mean look at Jessica Lange's first scene, she is introduced in a wet dress with erectus nippleus in full effect. I didn't remember that as a 10 year old boy...There's some smart era concerns in the narrative, fuels, discrimination etc, and for sure the array of characters on show are 1970s intelligent. Hell! even the change to helicopter attacks instead of aeroplanes for the finale deserves respect - with the added sombre setting of the WTC twin towers now more attention grabbing - yet it's hard to get away from just how poor the production is. So as we may still shed a tear as the giant beast is felled by his love for a beauty, and we curse mankind for just not leaving him on his island, this is still poor film making that comes close to shattering fond memories of the young movie lovers back in 1976. 5/10",King Kong
17,Theo Robertson,What Terrible Acting,4,6 July 2003,"There`s a few things that caused me to dislike this film , namely that director John Guillerman fails to bring any excitement or other worldliness to "" Kong Island "" , compare the locations used here which resemble Hawaii ( You`ll never guess where the location filming took place ) with the original movie . Oh and the man dressed up as a giant ape looks exactly like a man dressed up in a monkey suit . It must have hard for the cast to take King Kong seriously . In fact `s my main criticism about this remake , it`s very poorly acted . Jeff Bridges has always been good at playing cocky jack the lad types in films , but here he has all the charisma and charm of a tree . Jessica Lange is okay at standing around playing Dwan the supermodel but as soon as acting talent is required like showing fear or any other type of emotion she fails . Strange that Lange and Bridges continued to work in Hollywood with great acclaim after their performances here because they are fairly awful . I guess they were treating the film with the respect it deserved . Hopefully Peter Jackson will show Hollywood how to do a remake",King Kong
18,Hey_Sweden,Kong is still King.,7,10 January 2016,"1970s style re-imagining of the legendary cinema beauty-and-the-beast story stars Jeff Bridges as Jack Prescott, a hippie-ish paleontology professor who hitches a ride with an oil company's vessel. Their fearless leader, Fred Wilson (a shamelessly hammy Charles Grodin), is convinced that somewhere in the ocean near Surabaya is an island that's just rich with potential. Of course, we all know the story: what the adventurers find instead is an enormous ape, revered by the people of the island. Wilson attempts to salvage something out of the trip by transporting Kong back to NYC and putting him on display, but we know nothing good can come of this.This Dino De Laurentiis production is really not that terrible as its reputation would suggest. It just suffers some from a bit of overlength, an inadvisable campy approach, and its silly, silly characters & dialogue. The special effects (overseen by Carlo Rambaldi, later to create E.T.) are variable - sometimes they work well, sometimes not so well. The treat is watching makeup effects legend Rick Baker don a gorilla costume for some scenes. Although this remake is done in colour and widescreen, it just doesn't quite have the atmosphere of the 1933 film. It might have been nice to see a few more wonders on the island; as it is, we only get to see Kong do battle with a giant snake. The fact that in this instance Kong climbs not The Empire State Building but The Twin Towers may affect how some people respond to the film in this day and age. One obvious asset is the majestic music score by John Barry.Bridges is likable, but there are times when his character might infuriate some people. Grodin performs as if the filmmakers told him to ""act more like Robert Armstrong"" (Carl Denham in the 1933 production), and the character is so obnoxious and sleazy that you can't help but cheer when he inevitably gets his. Many viewers thought that Jessica Langes' debut film performance was highly inauspicious, but her appeal and beauty are undeniable. There's a very strong supporting cast: John Randolph, Rene Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Jack O'Halloran, Dennis Fimple, and Ed Lauter. It's nice to see 50s sci-fi star John Agar in a cameo as a lying weasel of a city official; John Lone, Corbin Bernsen, and Joe Piscopo have bits.In the end, the love that Kong lavishes upon Dwan (Lange) is still pretty poignant, and you can't help but feel very bad for Kong.Followed by a sequel (!) 10 years later, incredibly enough.""King Kong"" '76 misses its potential for true greatness, but it's still pretty decent entertainment.Seven out of 10.",King Kong
19,preppy-3,Not good but I have happy memories about it,7,26 June 2008,"The first (and virtually forgotten) remake of ""King Kong"". This one has an oil company called Petrox going to Skull Island to get oil. The expedition is run by evil Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Nice guy Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges looking like a hippie) is a stowaway who becomes their photographer. They find beautiful Dwan (Jessica Lange in her movie debut) stranded in the middle of the ocean. They get to the island, Dwan is offered as a sacrifice to Kong--but he falls in love with her. He's captured and bought to New York where he breaks loose and climbs the Word Trade Center with Dwan in his clutches.OK--this is not a good movie. However I saw it at the age of 14 in a movie theatre and was blown away by it. I found it big, exciting, funny and sad. Also people seem to forget that this DID have defenders. There were many positive reviews--even the legendary critic Pauline Kael gave it a good review in ""The New Yorker""! Still this has been regarded as a total bomb and derided from all sides. But I prefer this over that overblown Peter Jackson remake that ran an unnecessary three hours.First of all the special effects are great. Kong's face is incredibly expressive. You can SEE what he's feeling. Also I do like the fact that Lange doesn't scream nonstop like Fay Wray did in the original. The scenes between her and Kong include incredible special effects--and some of the most laughable lines in screen history! Lange TALKS to the ape--""You g**damn chauvinist pig ape!"" ""I'm a Libra. What sign are you?"" I mean COME ON!!!! There are plenty of things wrong with this though. The dialogue is dreadful--full of stupid jokes that are meant to be ironic (I guess). Get a load of the (very obviously) fake giant snake Kong fights on Skull Island! When they hit New York continuity goes flying out the window. Kong (somehow) finds Dwan in a small underground bar. No way that could happen. Also he's trampling down some oddly quiet streets in Manhattan--yet minutes later they're full of people. And the ending was just needlessly bloody. And HOW did Dwan get from the top of the World Trade Center to the street in a matter of minutes? Also seeing the World Trade Center (which no longer exists) might remind some people of the horrific 9/11 tragedy. As for the acting--Lange does what she can. Bridges is good if way too earnest. Grodin is just terrible.So--it is NOT a good movie but childhood memories die hard. I give it a 7.",King Kong
20,poolandrews,Despite it's bad reputation I actually rather enjoyed it.,7,25 January 2006,"King Kong starts in 'Surbabaya Indonesia' in a port where the 'Petrox Explorer' is about to set sail for a previously uncharted island recently photographed by a satellite orbiting the Earth, the photo's revealed that there is a possibility that the island is a rich source of oil & Petrox executive Fred S. Wilson (Charles Grodin) wants to get his hands on it before his competitors. Just before the ship sets sail paleontologist Jack Prescot (Jeff Bridges) sneaks aboard in hope of studying the islands untouched wildlife. As they head for the island they discover a raft floating in the open sea & pick up has been actress Dawn (Jessica Lange). Once on the island the initial landing party discover a primitive tribe who fear & worship a god they call Kong & they want to offer the pretty Dawn as a sacrifice, an idea which no-one is that keen about. That night back aboard the ship some natives kidnap Dawn, take her back to the island, chain her up & leave her for Kong who turns out to be a 40 foot Gorilla. Kong takes a shine to Dawn & carries her off, a rescue party is already on the island & they must set out to try & save Dawn from Kong & whatever other horrors the island holds...Directed by John Guillermin I actually had a fair amount of fun with this usually hated remake of the original 1933 classic. The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr. moves like an absolute rocket & at least is never dull or boring but at the same time it's rather camp & silly. Would a 40 foot Gorilla really be able to avoid detection in Manhattan by simply hiding behind a skyscraper? Would a 40 foot Gorilla be able to 'sneak' up on someone? What are the chances of a small raft being found in the middle of the ocean? The odds must be astronomical! A fog bank that remains totally unchanged for 100's of years? Wouldn't the wind not affect it at all? It sticks to the originals basic story except that all the monsters & dinosaurs are gone & have been replaced by a rubber snake that looks like one of those draft excluder's that you place at the bottom of doors. This is one aspect of the original that is sorely missed in this remake. The character's are over-the-top but quite likable, Wilson as the annoying Petrox executive irritates though. I liked it as a piece of harmless entertaining fun although it can't really compare to the original.Director Guillermin does an OK job, apparently Roman Polanski, Michael Winner & Sam Peckinpah were offered the chance to direct but turned it down, all I can say is I'd have loved to see what Michael Winner would have come up with! Now the special effects, well apparently Carlo Rambaldi built a 40 foot full sized mechanical Kong at a cost of $1.7 million but has about a minute of screen time & it looks awful so Guillermin went with Rick Baker in a monkey suit & the results variable to say the least. Each Kink Kong film had to work within limitations & are a product of they're time, the original has stop motion animation that won't impress many these days, this one has a man in a rubber suit & the recent remake has the nicest CGI effects you can get.With a healthy budget of about $25,000,000 King Kong is well made & has that Hollywood polish to it although I'm not sure it deserved two Oscar nominations, the Hawaiian locations are nice & the climax atop the World Trade Center has a strange feeling to it. The acting is OK but nothing spectacular.I know a lot of people dislike this remake, personally I'm judging it on it's own as I feel it's a completely separate film from the original or Peter Jacksons big budget remake. If you prefer the original to this than fine watch that, & I have to say now I'm a huge fan of it, as no-one is forcing you to watch or like this. Good fun & provides a couple of hours of entertainment & thats all I want in a film.",King Kong
21,utgard14,"""There is a girl out there who might be running for her life from some gigantic turned-on ape.""",4,6 July 2016,"Dino de Laurentiis' terrible remake of the 1933 classic that stands as a pretty big turd stain on his reputation. The plot to the original film is mostly the same here, with some minor (unnecessary) changes. This one starts out with an expedition led by Charles Grodin to find oil on an island that remains perpetually shrouded in fog. Along the way stowaway paleontologist Jeff Bridges and rescued castaway Jessica Lange join the expedition. Soon they're on the island and, well, you probably know what happens next.The script is courtesy of Lorenzo Semple, a writer of some respectability who dabbled in camp (he wrote for the '60s Batman TV series and also wrote the screenplays for Flash Gordon, Sheena, and the Raquel Welch ""classic"" Fathom). So throughout the film there's a not-so-subtle amount of nose-thumbing going on that's kind of insulting to fans of the original movie. To add more insult, the special effects for Kong basically consist of Rick Baker in an ape suit and an overpriced mechanical ape seen briefly here and there. Of the cast, Jeff Bridges comes out best. Which is to say he's the only one who goes through the motions without embarrassing himself. Charles Grodin chews scenery as he almost always does. The worst acting by far comes from Jessica Lange in her film debut. Her ditzy actress character ""Dwan"" is pretty bad on paper but Lange's breathlessly vapid performance just makes it all that much worse. Every scene with her is cringeworthy. The biggest thing that kills the movie is the sheer lack of wonder and imagination. You shouldn't do a movie about King Kong sarcastically or tongue-in-cheek or any of that stuff. It's a fantastic concept and you have to lose yourself in it or it just won't work like it should. 1933 as well as 2005 got it right, but 1976 shat the bed.",King Kong
22,lastliberal,"If he's not gonna eat her, why did he take her?",7,16 May 2007,"Now I know why Tommy Lee Jones has such trouble with his wife in Blue Sky. Her prior experience with King Kong messed her up for life. This was Jessica Lange's debut and she was the best part of this movie.Sure, the sound, special effects, cinematography were all outstanding, and I even liked Jeff Bridges and Rene Auberjonois, but it was Lange that made the movie.This is the third Kong I have seen and I have never see one that virtually dripped with sexuality and passion. If this movie went before the ratings board today, it might get a ""R"" for the scene where she is on the deck with a cigarette. I have never seen a cigarette look so sexual.Or the scene where she is drugged and the Kong surrogate is dancing in front of her. That scene was more passionate than a Jenna Jameson flick.Or the scene where Kong appears and she sees him for the first time. It was as if she was deflowered. the scream was pure ecstasy! The shower scene where Kong blows on her to dry her was supercharged! Sure, this is a Kong film, but with Lange it became a porno film. If this film doesn't excite you, you are dead!",King Kong
23,neil-476,Monkey suits - aaargh!,5,30 December 2010,"I don't know if Jessica Lange looks back at her film debut in the 1976 King Kong with embarrassment. She may well do so, because it is indeed embarrassing (although, to be fair, much of the embarrassment derives from how the character was written rather than how it was performed. However, the character of Dwan isn't half as embarrassing as the way Kong is realised.A man in a monkey suit is substantially cheaper than animation. However, a man in a monkey suit is also unmistakably a man in a monkey suit. This is due to the fact that ape proportions are different to human proportions - in a nutshell, apes' arms are longer. Of course, you can add arm extensions, which helps - they didn't do that here, so you have a man in a monkey suit.Geoff Bridges is OK. Charles Grodin isn't funny. Rick Baker's hydraulically operated ape face is excellent.This falls short of being a worthy failure.",King Kong
24,AaronCapenBanner,Remake.,5,19 October 2013,"John Guillermin directed this updated remake of the classic original. Charles Grodin plays a Petrox oil company representative named Fred Wilson sent to Skull Island to find rumored oil reserves there, which would greatly enrich himself and the company. Opposing this is Jack Prescott(played by Jeff Bridges) an environmentalist determined to investigate what Petrox is up to. They discover a shipwreck survivor named Dwan(played by Jessica Lange) who comes ashore on the island, where she and the crew face similar menaces that Fay Wray and that crew did in the original. Kong is later captured and brought for public display by Petrox, but resents this captivity, escaping his restraints and going on a rampage before heading for the World Trade Center...Marginal film has some exciting scenes, good ape costume and thoughtful ideas, but is hurt by some poor dialogue, unintentional humor, and lack of ambition in the jungle sequence(just a giant snake!)

The group finds that the island is inhabited and the local natives worship Kong. They abduct Dwan to offer her in sacrifice. The crew hike into the jungle to rescue Dwan, but Kong falls in love with her and protects her. When Fred finds that the oil in the island is not ready for exploitation, he decides to capture Kong and bring him to New York for exhibition. In the middle of a show, Kong escapes, bringing panic to the locals.....Is it the best film of Kong ever made? Absolutely not, but blimey, it's the most fun out of the three most prolific Kong movies released.And the simple reason is the grandeur of everything going on here, from the beautiful sets,to the wonderful cast, right up to the brilliant effects and puppetry.The efforts that the makers went to to make Kong as realistic as possible is something to marvel at, and considering Star Wars was release around this time, this didn't really suffer for spectacle.But then with the good, you get the bad, and sometimes, the guy in the ape suit gets a little bit over zealous and it turns into the muppet show.Bridges is great, and makes the film a little more serious than it should be, due to slightly dodgy script.So it's not the failure most make it out to be, its more palatable than Jackson's, but that's because it's just so bonkers at times to be average.",King Kong
26,The_Void,The eighth wonder of the world is a man in a gorilla suit?,3,22 December 2005,"This remake has been pretty much forgotten about in recent years, and that's just as well because it's terrible. The original film came out forty three years before this one, and you would think, therefore, that this version would have greatly improved on the special effects. That's not the case at all; the original version may not look great in today's CGI age; but it's a hell of a lot better than this one. The ape in the original at least looked real if you stretched your imagination; but no matter how much you stretch it here, Kong is just a man in a suit; and it really does bring the whole thing down. I find it impossible to take an 'ape' walking upright seriously...it's like they just couldn't be bothered! The story has changed for this film, too, and instead of being a film crew travelling to Skull Island to make a picture, we follow an oil expedition that go there in order to find some oil. The island turns out to be more than they bargained for, however, when they meet up with the giant ape; King Kong! They also find a girl on a lifeboat in an obvious attempt to explain why there would be a woman around for Kong to obsess over...The plot details aren't the only thing that's been changed here - there are no Dinosaurs either! We get to see Kong wrestling a rubber snake (in a totally ridiculous scene), and that's all the monster fighting there is. Skull Island has gone from a lush, tropical jungle bursting with life - to a horrible, baron wasteland desolate of everything (including a giant ape that doesn't look like a man in a suit). In fact, I can't think of anything about this film that wasn't done a million times better in the original. The cast is this film's biggest asset - with Jeff Bridges taking the lead role. He looks every bit the rugged hero and if it wasn't for him, I'd have REALLY hated this film. Jessica Lange gets to be Fay Wray; and, at times, comes close to evoking an emotional impact from the audience. The original cast was far, far better though. Even the famous Empire States Building ending has been forsaken in favour of having the man in a suit atop the World Trade Centre. Why? ...I have no idea. Overall, I really can't recommend seeing this film. Forget it was made - see the original, see Peter Jackson's version...but please; avoid this rubbish like the plague. Would you believe...it actually gets WORSE when Kong appears?!",King Kong
27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: King Kong (1976),6,2 November 2005,"This movie is as old as I am, but it's not the original. Yes you heard me right. The original big gorilla debut in 1933. and this is a remake. Unless you've been residing in Mars, you'll also know that Peter Jackson will be adapting King Kong for the big screen for a release next month, and thank heavens it's closely based on the original.While this film also adapts from the same source material by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace, it has taken certain liberties and artistic license to change some character backgrounds and premise. For example, the film crew has been replaced with oil prospectors, and the blonde lass doesn't start off the journey with the team, but actually plucked out unconscious from the sea, an actress wannabe who didn't enjoy Deep Throat (don't ask). Gone too is the iconic scene atop the Empire States Building, now Kong scales the World Trade Center and hops between the two towers (alas, September 11 changed it all).However, this movie still retained much of the story's structure - team ventures into island, chances upon island inhabitants, inhabitants kidnap blonde lass as a sacrifice to the great Kong, the beauty and the beast sequence, the capture of Kong, bringing him back to New York, and all hell breaks loose.Just not quite. This Kong is quite benign in nature, and only goes berserk when jealousy makes him go on a rampage against those trying to prise his lass away from him. The effects look dated if you watch them today, and the animatronics probably made a giant ape hand - that's the only mechanical limb you get to see up close, the rest can be figured as a man in a rubber suit, captured using various techniques to achieve the desired proportions for size. Don't go scrutinizing the plot too, as there are gaping loopholes, and plenty of minor characters. Oh, Singapore's mentioned a lot of times in the first twenty minutes, as the ship crew navigates from Surabaya, Indonesia en route to looking for oil.Starring a very young and very hairy Jeff Bridges in the role of a professor / ape expert, this movie is probably famous for introducing a very nubile Jessica Lange in her first feature film. She could be considered as the Jessica Simpson of that era, having prancing around the island in hot pants and tank tops, various strapless gowns and in wet island garb, which gave way to a wardrobe malfunction when Kong molested her with its finger (don't ask - the ape's probably horny too).So while awaiting Peter Jackson's masterpiece, why not get your hands on this adapted classic too? Good for compare, contrast, but don't go bananas over this one if it doesn't meet your expectations.",King Kong

It's just kind of ""average"". In its first hour, about the only thing that keeps it going is Jessica Lange's gorgeousness (she has a superbly well-defined figure, which is very often exposed). Then, the pace picks up and the special effects take over, but they are variable in quality; sometimes Kong looks awesome, just like he should, but other scenes don't work at all (the low points are his fight with a rubber snake and a scene at the end where Lange supposedly ""touches"" his bleeding body). What I disliked most of all here were the moments of campiness (Kong grinning leeringly to Lange, Lange calling him a ""big chauvinist ape""). But it's fairly entertaining, and the last 20 minutes are now historically important, too - for obvious reasons. (**)",King Kong
33,Cineanalyst,Disaster King,5,28 April 2021,"Situated as it is between the 1933 RKO original, as well as the earliest Japanese kaiju to feature Kong, such as ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" (1962), and Peter Jackson's 2005 CGI spectacle and the CGI spectacle of ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017) of the MonsterVerse after that, this 1976 remake may be easy to forget in the crowd. Even more so its sequel ""King Kong Lives"" (1986). It doesn't help to distinguish it, either, that this ""King Kong"" doesn't do anything extraordinary. It's part of the 1970s trend of disaster films, and ""Jaws"" (1975) had recently proved how profitable giant monster movies could be. The effects for Kong are a mix between ""Godzilla"" (1954) suitmation and ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) makeup. Composite shots with a guy in a monkey costume instead of the prior stop-motion animation or later motion capture and computer art. Plus, there's some large-scale mechanical work for Kong's hand holding Fay Wray stand-in Dwan, as portrayed by then-newcomer Jessica Lange. It's not bad special effects for the day, but neither is it particularly novel. Ditto John Barry's score relative to the all-time great one from Max Steiner for the 1933 film.Everything that works narratively here, too, is but a selective variation on the 1933 version. In a misguided attempt to update the colonialist theme of the picture's expedition to and extraction from an uncharted island, fresh off the 1973 oil embargo, we get oil men instead of filmmakers, plus a bit of half-hearted post-Nixon jabs at U. S. political corporatism and post-Vietnam jeering by long-haired Jeff Bridges while viewing the climactic military assault against Kong. Ho-hum. Meanwhile, this alteration entirely undermines the continuation of the wannabe actress (Dwan) being cast in a stage act with the captured creature, as that monster was originally a metaphor for movies--Fay Wray literally snapped up off the streets of New York to become a star upon the city's biggest stage (the Empire State Building then, and the World Trade Center here). We do get Bridges moonlighting as the expedition's photographer, as well as a primatologist (because the likes of Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey had popularized the field by then), but that largely comes across as an afterthought. Even the 2017 ""Skull Island"" handled this reflexivity better. Kong was no mere god of Hollywood's stereotype of black natives; he was the embodiment and expression of feared retaliation of the colonialist gaze that othered the foreign conquered and pillaged to monstrous proportions.This ""Kong"" does do one thing somewhat well, though: the sex. (Of lesser consequence, I also liked what I think was a subtle reference to Godzilla regarding a bottled message from 1954 Japan that Bridges's character mentions). The pre-code and subsequently heavily censored in re-issues 1933 film tied up its imperialist themes in sexual desires and fears, too. Although it got away with a PG rating (in the days before PG-13), this post-code 1976 production made during the Sexual Revolution is in some ways even more blunt about the matter. She's shipwrecked from another film, ""Deep Throat"" (1972), with all the sexual baggage of the pornography and the political borrowings in the Watergate reporting. The oil man flat out claims that Kong was trying to rape Dwan, and there's a bit of her being stripped by Kong's finger in one scene--although even that's not as overtly sexual as the scene censored from the 1933 version. On the other hand, that Dwan is portrayed as a ditzy blonde and that the camera lingers on her exiting a shower when no other character is around makes me think the filmmakers didn't actually understand the racialized sexual complications of the original premise and just resorted to typical ""male gaze"" sleaze. Of course, we don't get the beauty-and-the-beast line this outing, because these filmmakers aren't even sure what Kong is, let alone the reason behind his fate.",King Kong
34,ericstevenson,This movie is just okay,6,13 September 2017,"It's hard for me to hate this movie because there really isn't anything to hate. There isn't anything to love either. This is the first remake of the 1933 classic and it's mostly forgotten as we have the much superior 2005 remake. This film holds a candle to neither, but it's not too bad either. It's basically just King Kong with nothing new put in. There is one part where it actually improves over the 2005 version. That movie didn't even show how King Kong got to New York City. This movie shows him down below on board a giant ship.The worst thing about this movie is the lack of monsters. All we see is just one giant snake and that's it. That's nowhere near as cool as Kong fighting a dinosaur. It was so cool to see all the other inhabitants of the island in both other versions. This was just mostly dull. We do get some pretty good scenes with the woman trying to communicate with Kong. Yes, it's very weird to see Kong climbing the World Trade Center. Would this film be banned from TV now? I mean, I certainly haven't heard of it being on network TV. **1/2",King Kong
35,secondtake,"See this 3rd most famous King Kong as pure campy romp, tongue in cheek!",6,30 September 2012,"King Kong (1976)There are a lot of ways to watch a King Kong movie that owes so much to that first 1933 version. And most of them will bring this 1976 version, the ""Jessica Lange version,"" up short.But a certain attitude will help--this is a purposely campy movie. By camp I mean a deliberate exaggeration so that the stereotypes and clichés play out as a kind of ongoing laugh. If you click into that you'll rather like this monstrosity of a movie. And this isn't just making the most of some crappy movie-making--there are lots of cues toward camp, beginning with the atrociously overacting acting and ending with the graphic match cut of the World Trade Center with some Kong-land rocks. Between these two is a weird sexual encounter between Lange and the ape and a giant gasoline pump as a patriotic animal cage cover. There is no way to take this movie seriously--so don't.In its defense there is also a kind of inventive intention here, simply to make the King Kong story contemporary, which in this case means the 1970s oil crisis slick disco era. Remember, ""Saturday Night Live"" was the next year, and it will be five whole years before the more outrageously funny ""Airplane"" that takes exaggeration to new heights. Some liberties are allowed the writers, such as an island that somehow still evaded satellite discovery because of permanent cloud cover, but then it's a step by step echo of the original. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that the climax doesn't occur on the Empire State Building but a bit further downtown at another iconic skyscraper site. That alone should appeal to many.One big disappointment? The filming itself. This is an era where the camera work could rather easily have made the most of the fantasy scenes on the island and the Kong on the loose scenes in New York. It comes to a disappointing peak n the final attack on the monster--with helicopters--that lacks visual excitement, replacing it with a surprising amount of blood packet gore. If there is one part of the film that doesn't lend itself to camp, it's the famous ending, and there is no redeeming energy. Just forced sadness.Lange is sort of terrific, despite the awkward shortcomings, even taking the movie for what it is. She plays a beautiful object beautifully, surely, but she is the one character who makes clear the humor in her exaggerations. The other actors being campy look more like bad actors, unfortunately. And the leading male, a scruffy Jeff Bridges, is a huge bore, perhaps the second biggest reason for the film falling flat in so many scenes.The biggest reason is the director, who has to take the rap for all the missed opportunities, for making an amazing ending dull, and for not sucking us into the ambitious sets and novel updating of the now-classic story. John Guillermin has directed more than his share of clinkers, including the apparently terrible sequel ""King Kong Lives"" which gets a whopping 3 stars out of 10 on this site. His most famous film, ""The Blue Max,"" looks increasingly dated to my eyes, and it goes downhill from there. Which means that someone somewhere might do a contemporary twist on the original tale someday. The two other archetypal Kong movies include of course the original, which we might call the ""Fay Ray version,"" which is amazingly good considering the limitations to it all. And there is a fairly recent version, the ""Naomi Watts version,"" which avoid lots of problems by setting the movie back to 1933, and which has the most outrageous, over-the-top special effects with the monster. For sheer acting, Watts is the best of the three women, and because of her this latest version might be the most moving, though it is very long, even longer in the extended version. For originality and unmatched compact punch, head for the first one, the RKO breakthrough.",King Kong
36,jacobjohntaylor1,not as good the original but still a good remake,9,22 May 2014,This is not as good as King Kong (1933) or King Kong (2005) But still a good movie third beast King Kong movie. It is better then the sequels to King Kong (1933). First there was Son of Kong from 1933. Then there was King Kong vs Godzilla from 1963. Then there was King Kong escapes from 1968. Those were good movie. All the King Kong movie are good. But those was better then Son of Kong or King Kong vs Godzilla or King Kong escapes. Some people go to an uncharted island to drill for oil. They end up battling a giant killer gorilla. It is a very good movie. Great acting. Great special effects. Great story. See this movie. See all the King Kong movies. This is a great great movie.,King Kong
37,pmtelefon,The poster is a ripoff but the movie is good,8,21 May 2020,"I saw ""King Kong"" when it was in the theater. I've seen it quite a few times since. I watched it again this morning. ""King Kong"" is a good movie. It looks great. It's location photography is very good. The cast is also good. Jessica Lange is the standout. She's stunningly dreamy in this movie. The special effects are a little dated now but, for the most part, they still look good. ""King Kong"" does run out of steam a little bit in the second half but not enough to be a deal breaker. This movie is always a satisfying watch.",King Kong
38,matthewssilverhammer,"...And I am sorry, but ""Dwan"" is not a name.",1,6 June 2021,"Not only is this the worst of the 3 Hollywood Kong movies, but it is also one of the poorest directed movies of this size I have ever seen; in every area, it fails (visuals, emotions, editing, characters, storytelling). Kong is a hideously designed sexual predator who parades around as a supremely perverse king of the incels...yet it still wants us to empathize with him.",King Kong
39,funkyfry,The best version of King Kong,7,23 April 2008,"Yes, I will go ahead and come right out and say it -- I've seen all 3 of the big budget King Kong movies and I enjoyed this one the most of all. The effects certainly aren't as groundbreaking or classic as Willis O'Brien's effects for the original, but in general it's not fair to judge a movie just based on effects. The original movie has a pretty good script but unfortunately the directors had no clue how to get a performance out of actors -- just look at how badly they botched Joel McCrea's performance in ""The Most Dangerous Game"" as well. The people in Cooper and Schoedsack's movies always seem like they are reading off cue cards. In contrast, in this movie we have a trio of real gutsy and interesting performers, Jeff Bridges as Jack, Jessica Lange as Dwan, and Charles Grodin as Fred Wilson, a stand-in for Carl Denham in the other 2 versions. The changes made to the characters really work well in the movie's favor in my opinion. Instead of just being some random actor with almost no personality, in this version Jack is a scientist who stows away on the boat to Skull Island. Because he's a zoologist, he has a connection to Kong that Jack in the other films did not have, and he feels more a real part of the film and less of an obligatory presence than he does in the other versions. In fact it's a very interesting situation -- Jack cares about Kong and he thinks that Kong is getting a raw deal, but only Dwan can actually get close to Kong. There's an element of jealousy in Jack's attitude towards Kong (notice how in the scene with Kong on the ship, the director cuts from the shot of Jack frustrated with Dwan to a shot of Kong sleeping) but he overcomes it and ends up trying to save Kong's life towards the end. I would say that making Jack a more substantial character was probably the major factor that pushes this film above the other versions. Not to mention that Jeff Bridges is a heck of a lot more interesting actor than Robert Armstrong or Adrian Brody. That's not to say that this is Jeff Bridges' greatest moment as an actor, but I loved how he played the character and made him so different from the other men in the movie (which is a HUGE problem with the other two versions), and I love the passion we can feel from him when he talks about how they've actually destroyed Skull Island's culture by stealing Kong (""we've stolen the magic and the mystery of their lives"").Charles Brodin is also great in this movie, way more convincing as an underhanded manipulator than Jack Black or Bruce Cabot. I like the idea of turning him into an oil man, and it's hilarious how quickly he makes the transition from oil to show business. I haven't read a lot of comments or reviews about this movie but I wonder if people have just not noticed a lot of the really amusing satirical aspects of this version. I thought it was fantastic at the end when you have the re-enactment of Kong's capture of Dwan, and instead of taking place in a generic nightclub like the other two, we have this bizarre set piece of a gigantic gas pump being wheeled out to the sacrificial altar. It's like the film is saying -- native people worship Kong, and civilized people worship big oil. It speaks very strongly to the fetishism of our particular culture, much as the original film made the connection between the Empire State Building and the mountains of Skull Island (in this film somewhat unfortunately it's the World Trade Center instead).Then not to leave out Ms. Lange, of course this again isn't her best role but I like what she brings to this film. She really does seem like a bimbo in the early parts, and looks just fantastic. I can believe the changes and the maturity that her character is finding through coming into contact with Kong.A lot of people have complained about the effects in this version, specifically the monkey suit designed by Carlo Rambaldi and Rick Baker. First of all the animatronic head is fantastic, the amount of expression they got from it is very impressive. The animatronic hand, less so... it looks like plush vinyl. The sets that were built for this film, especially the huge wall, are very impressive as well. In the new version of course everything is digital and looks like a video game for the most part. By the way, the snake that Kong fights is obviously the same one that Conan fought in DeLaurentis' ""Conan the Barbarian"" with a different head put on it (Kong got rid of the original head there). Now, I like stop motion as much as the next guy. DeLaurentis could have hired Jim Danforth or Ray Harryhausen to do some effects for this movie. But in my opinion stop motion is not a good option for a contemporary story shot in color. I think combining miniatures with matte shots was the right approach. This is a film with its tongue in cheek, lots of good honest laughs to go along with the action and pathos. I love how arrogant and at the same time naive Grodin's character is, I laughed out loud when he landed on Skull Island and said, ""We don't want to get eaten alive on this island! Bring the mosquito spray."" And we don't have to hear his character say that lame line about ""It was Beauty that killed the Beast"" like we do in the other two versions, he just gets squashed like he should be.Watch closely for a guest appearance by John Agar and listen closely for a quick homage to Hitchcock (the beast heads ""North by Northwest"" at one point).",King Kong
40,GOWBTW,"Flawed Remake, plenty of entertainment",6,14 April 2006,"I've seen better remakes in my time. Back in 1976, ""King Kong"" looked fun. Now 30 years later, it's a totally different story. This Kong here is bi-pedal. Nothing more than a man in a gorilla suit. Just as ferocious as the 1933 version, only a a lot of change were made there. I did take notice that they blurred Jessica Lange's areolas in the movie. Very discreet of the people there. And this Kong was a bigger horn-dog primate than the original version. There were no other creatures in the remake, only the big snake. And that scene, was a bit too short for me. That snake didn't stand a chance when Kong popped it. The cast in the movie were indeed great. Charles Grodin as the greedy oil magnet, Jeff Bridges, was the most level-headed one in the movie. And Jessica Lange in her debut, did a spectacular job playing Dwan. Though I was living in New York at the time, I would worry about Kong heading around Long Island. Of Course, who would come here? There's nothing more than houses and a few parks. Then it would be total pandemonium! This movie was all right, not the greatest remake now, but back then, it was. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",King Kong
41,FiendishDramaturgy,"A dated ""hit"" remake awaiting the dawning of the Jackson era",7,20 October 2003,"When this was first released, I loved this movie. At the time of its theatrical release, I remember that the line for tickets went around the building! While this production is now heavily dated and yes, there are campy moments, and the unbearable clichés, this was a state-of-the-art production in its time. I saw this movie on the big screen when it first came out. The lines went out and around the entire theater building in the city where I grew up. Around the building and back to the front where another line formed. Many were turned away for another showing of this blockbuster hit. However good it was then, it has lost a bit of its luster over the years. The invention and subsequent refinement of CGI has vastly dated this move. Outdated it, in fact. I cannot WAIT to see Peter Jackson's newest project; the remake of King Kong, due to be released in 2005. I bide the time in great anticipation.Jeff Bridges was a real star in this production. His character was believable and honest and his portrayal was extremely professional. I loved the way his character always got the best of Charles Grodin. It made me laugh countless times. Although the hair styles are indicative of the 70's (Bridges's makes him resemble a Wookie), as are the clothing styles, I still find this movie quite endearing, adventurous, and entertaining.The shots of the island are absolutely breathtaking. Much like the beginning shots of Jurassic Park when you first arrive. The characters were developed quite well, and the story itself is timeless. While this endeavor does start off a bit slow, the necessary character development has begun, and takes place along the way. Perhaps you can distract yourself with Lange's striking figure and half-exposed body during this time, while you get to know the characters, or let Bridges's Wookie-like appearance endear him to your heart. Dwan (Dwan?! - Lange) is a treasure; a pink lady from another world, and the natives who found her have decided that she is the perfect offering to their god; a colossal ape they have come to call ""Kong."" In the opening scenes featuring the introduction to Kong, he is really quite well done. You can actually believe he is a 30' ape absconding with the pismire Dwan in his hands. Later; however, the effects go wrong, with the use of animatronics. They lost the realism they had achieved, specifically during the fight scene with the giant snake.When his oil-finding expedition goes bad, Fred Wilson (Grodin) learns that the petroleum present on Kong's Island needs a little more time; just a tick of the clock, geologically speaking. In just around ten thousand more years, it will be productive petroleum. For lack of a cash cow to justify this farciful journey, Wilson determines it would be best to bring back Kong, rather than return to his New York investors empty handed. The plans of mice and men; however, are sure to twist, crumble, and fade.Be sure to make note of the scene where Charles Grodin finds himself in a hole which turns out to be Kong's footprint. It shows you where the writers/directors of ""Godzilla,"" 1998 (the Roland Emmerich one which I like to call ""Jurassiczilla""), got the idea for a nearly identical scene in that movie.The musical score is quite compelling and lends quite a bit to the feeling of mystery and wonder this movie captures, though it is classic 70's score. The sets and costumes were quite original and creatively done. I especially thought the native costuming was well designed and manufactured, with a true Polynesian feel to them.And, while some of the scenes between Lange and the ape are campy and filled with cliché after cliché, they were still endearing and heart-warming. With tongue-in-cheek, my mate has just quipped, ""This movie just proves that anybody can fall in love with a rich white girl."" I included that because it was the sum of the underlying camp throughout. But it somehow does not detract from the richness of the production. This movie is far greater than the sum of its parts. ""King Kong: the Legend Reborn,"" does breathe new life into the '30's classic, as I hope Peter Jackson's remake does, and bring to it at least some of the magic he achieved in his ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.Once back in New York, Grodin's character is largely under foot as Kong escapes and begins to find his way back to Dwan. Of course, if you even momentarily try to imagine the mayhem that would be generated by such a massive beast loose in New York City, you have to stop and ask yourself if the residents there would even notice. In true Godzilla style, Kong grabs the subway train in which Lange and Bridges are escaping, and unceremoniously rips the top off of it just in time to see his beloved Dwan running away with that other man...again. Needless to say, he is not a happy camper. And, just like Godzilla, Kong quickly learns not to play with power lines.Regardless of your nationality, please pay special attention to the last scenes of this wonderful production. The NYC Twin Towers are prevalent and, though I never viewed it from this perspective before 9-11, they are now the real stars in this movie. I had no choice but to view it with a certain melancholy sadness.All in all, although admittedly not as much as when it was first released, I still greatly enjoyed this work and highly recommend its viewing; especially in light of the upcoming remake. They've changed the character's names, rearranged the story, and forgotten the dinosaurs. But in the genre of monster movies, it is a definite must-see.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",King Kong
42,Captain_Couth,Terrible remake that was totally unnecessary.,2,3 March 2005,"King Kong (1976) was a total waste of time and money from the always bankrupt producer Dino De Laurentis (he didn't learn his lesson then and he'll never will). He threw a lot of money at this turkey. The end results was that nobody came out to this movie in droves and it cost him dearly. The direction was ham fisted, the special effects were terrible (they should have stuck with stop motion puppets instead of some clown in a gorilla suit) and the finale was a joke. To top it off, the running time was well over two hours (the bad direction and pacing made it feel like five hours).The changes to the original plot and story were unnecessary (that's what ruins a lot of these remakes, don't fix what ain't broke people). You expect a movie that has the special effects crew of Rick Baker and Rob Bottin would have better effects than the ones on display. A shame really, after all that money they threw at this production you'd think they would have put on a better show. The only thing cool about this movie was the original theatrical poster. It shows stuff that has nothing to do with the movie. If it did this movie would have been watchable. Instead it's an example of what happens to a production when you have a lot of money and no discernible talent. Like Hollywood productions today!Npt recommended.",King Kong

44,kevin_robbins,This is a slightly above average installment to the series that's worth watching once but I wouldnt go too out of my way to see it,6,15 October 2021,"King Kong (1976) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows an oil company who believes they found a deserted island that is about to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. They are accompanied by a environmentalist stowaway and a woman they rescue along the way. They find much more than they anticipated on the island - no oil and a large ape worshipped by the locals. They decide there may still be a chance for fortune after all. This movie is directed by John Guillermin (The Towering Inferno) and stars Jeff Bridges (True Grit), Charles Grodin (Midnight Run), Jessica Lange (Tootsie) and Ed Lauter (Cujo). The storyline for this is fairly straightforward and as you'd expect, nothing overly original. The acting is solid and Bridges was perfect in his role. I can't say Lang played a great sex symbol, she was just okay. The ape scenes were fun with some mechanical and some a man in a suit. I did enjoy all the scenes he was in but was disappointed it took 55 minutes into the film for him to appear. The natives are well depicted as is the insensitive oil company. Overall this is a slightly above average installment to the series that's worth watching once but I wouldnt go too out of my way to see it. I'd score this a 5.5/10.",King Kong
45,robfollower,Introducing Jessica Lange in her film debut,9,2 April 2021,"You all know the story; a shipload of men are going to Skull Island and along the way they pick up an attractive young woman who was ""saved by Deep Throat"". Once they arrive, they discover a giant wall, a tribe of natives, and soon realize that the tribe is involved in sacrificing women to a giant ape. The natives eventually kidnap the aspiring actress and offer her to the huge primate named Kong. He takes her, and the adventure begins.With a script by Lorenzo Semple Jr., creator of the similarly tongue-in-cheek Batman television series, this version of Kong is loaded with silly dialogue and situations.Jessica Lange was indeed recruited out of 'nowhere' to be 'discovered' by Dino De Laurentiis. Before Kong Lange was mainly a model with an impressive education and some stage and dance experience. Jessica Lange was sensational as sexualized Dwan ! She could act in her debut role and it shows . Lange a very alluring . She has sexy vulnerability about her spirit. Her talent is very obvious. She was panned by some critics who apparently can not spot talent . She had many lines that she delivered with her Veronica Lake Marilyn Monroe influences. And Jessica Lange used that sexualized persona brilliantly. Because of her terrific performance she retains her dignity! I have pre-ordered the Shout ! King Kong (1976) Collector's Edition - Blu-ray releasing on my Birthday May 11 2021. I think that Jessica Lange is the biggest reason that audiences stick with the movie. Her silly 'conversations' with Kong are reasonably funny.Quotable's :Jessica Lange : Sometimes I get too physical, it's a sign of insecurity, you know, like when you knock down trees. ... Such a nice ape. Such a nice, sweet - nice, sweet, sweet monkey. You know, we're gonna be great friends. I'm a Libra. What sign are you? Nice, sweet monkey. We're gonna be great friends."" -- Dwan to King Kong.Jessica Lange: Hey, Kong. Remember me from before, your blind date? Why are you waking up all these sleepy people? -- Dwan to King Kong.Jessica Lange: "" Did you ever meet anyone before whose life was saved by ""Deep Throat""? --Dwan to ship crewJessica Lange : ""You God damn chauvinist pig ape! What are you waiting for? You wanna eat me? Then go ahead! Do it! Go ahead and eat me! Go ahead! Choke on me! -- Dwan to King Kong.Jessica Lange : ""Oh, come on, Kong. Forget about me. This things just never gonna work. Can't you see? -- Dwan to King Kong.What makes King Kong such an exciting monster was the production team. They Employed Carlo Rambaldi, Rick Baker, and Rob Bottin in the effects department. The creature effects for 100% practical using a ape bodysuit and some Animatronics ..... mechatronic puppets. The film was released on December 17, 1976 to mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. It won a noncompetitive Special Achievement Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound.Overall, the story is presented with heart (thanks, in large part to Jessica Lange's performance) and spirited work by Jeff Bridges who both make the show watchable and even fun. 9/10.",King Kong

It's one thing to remake an effects-laden film and take advantage of advanced technology to make a better film, but KING KONG does just the opposite. It's effects are worse than the '33 version! There are times when Kong is clearly a giant robot...a robot with a low battery to boot! In many scenes, it's just a man in an ape suit. Somehow, this junk won a special Oscar. Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange and Charles Grodin have the leads and manage NOT to embarrass themselves despite the nonsense around them.

47,yusufpiskin,Good Re-Make,6,14 March 2020,"I actually saw King Kong in a packed theater that was crying loudly at the end of the movie. Kong was a major hit in 1976.....earning almost $200 million in adjusted box office gross. I even got a King Kong board game for my birthday. So I have fond memories of King Kong. Rating this movie as a 8 year old kid in 1988...was easy....it was an awesome movie.Fast forward the tape to 2014...I am now older and maybe a little wiser.....and things are not looking so rosy for King Kong. First lets look at the good stuff: Kong's island looks awesome. Jeff Bridges is solid as usual. Jessica Lange looks very sexy. The costume design for the natives on Kong's island are top notch.Now for the bad stuff: Lange is now a 2 time Oscar winner....but this was her first movie role and she is pretty bad. The dialogue Lange has to spit out is just horrible. Charles Grodin is better than Lange but not by much. The special effects team actually received a special Oscar for their work....but they are weak. Part of the huge press for the movie was the fact that they actually built a 40 foot robotic King Kong that cost 1.7 million dollars. What audiences did not know back then was the fact that the robotic Kong did not work and was only seen in the movie for 2 or 3 very quick shots. The rest of the time...Kong is just a guy in a gorilla suit. Basically it was an American version of Godzilla...with a guy in a gorilla suit destroying miniature sets.Of the three main Kong movies.....this one ranks third....I would recommend the original first, then Peter Jackson's Kong and finally this one...just be prepared to groan more than once when you watch the movie.

48,drystyx,"Over the top message, but lots to like",6,4 April 2008,"This version of King Kong has a log scene, so it has all it needs.The story, by the way, is bunch of white guys land on uncivilized, uncharted island full of monsters, and capture a big ape, who makes the girl with them his little pet.This version indicates a sort of love affair, which is pretty ridiculous considering it would be like a normal sized man having a love affair with a three inch high woman. It really only works as a ""loved pet"" scenario.That said, this version established some believable characters, and gave the minor characters more depth than the original. In most ways, it is a much better story than the original.The Robert Armstrong character has since been made out as a bad guy, which actually makes more sense than the original. Even then, his character was haughty, and should've been a heavy. This character is the most important in the Kong movies.The hero is well over the top in liberal ideas that get a bit preachy even for a liberal like me. It is a little too ""expository"", and doesn't settle for a natural story line. The character is believable, but the perfection of all his actions is less than credible.This is probably the best story line of the Kong movies.

51,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Looking Remake with Social Commentary,7,27 September 2019,"This film I feel like I might have saw part of it when I was growing up, but I never actually watched this until I was an adult. I had seen the original 1933 version as well as the Peter Jackson remake in the theaters. This is really a story I didn't fully appreciate until I was an adult though and could comprehend the idea it was trying to convey. The synopsis here is a petroleum exploration expedition comes to an isolated island and encounters a colossal giant gorilla.We start off seeing a barge that's preparing to leave. The head of this expedition is Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). With him is a geologist named Bagley (Rene Auberjonois). The captain of the ship is Ross (John Randolph). We see a guard that is bribed by Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) and lets him through the gate. He sneaks onto the vessel before it leaves.We then shift to a meeting room where the men are being filled in on their expedition. Fred shows slides of an area in the Pacific Ocean where he thinks there is a huge oil deposit. There were pictures taken a long time ago of a fog bank. Thirty years later, another picture in the same area and the mist is the same. It is then revealed that through some bribes, they figured out there's an island there. Jack sneaks into this as well to reveal who he is, a student at Stanford as well as an anthologist. He provides stories of the island and from scared people about ape-like creature there.Fred at first is thinks he's spy until it checks out. He is made the photographer for the expedition. A distress signal is received and soon after they find a life raft in the ocean. On it is Dwan (Jessica Lange). It turns out that the yacht she was on has sunk. She was on her way with a director to star in a film in Hong Kong.They make it to the mist. The forward team consists of Jack, Fred, Carnahan (Ed Lauter) and a few other men. Dwan is forbidden to come, but convinces them otherwise. Crossing through the fog, they find an island hidden inside. They go on to shore and find a giant wall. Fred believes it to be ancient, but Jack points out there has been places where it has been repaired. Fred believes the island to be uninhabited, but then they hear drums.The group watches a ceremony where a young woman is to be married to a man in an ape costume. That is until the head priest finds the intruders. They want Dwan, but she is denied to them. They prepare to attack, but shots are fired which scare the natives away. The crew flees back to the ship. Fred wants to make another journey, but jack heard the word Kong and speculates what is behind the wall. Fred is more interested in the pools of black liquid that look like oil. The natives get what they want as they row out to the barge and kidnap Dwan. They give her a drink that sedates her. She is tied between two poles. A rescue mission is mounted and comes after her, but they're too late as Kong takes her into the jungle. They have to do what they can to save her and Fred learns bad news about the substance found. He does come up with another plan to recoup his losses though.I have to say that coming in I was worried about this being a shot-for-shot remake. What I liked about this version was that it was updated and did something different than the original. I like that their original plan to find the island is for oil. This is actually something really fitting even for today. If you know anything about me, I find humanity to be garbage and we destroy more than we do good. Fred literally doesn't care about the island or its inhabitants. He is willing to destroy their island if there is oil here.When his initial plans fail, decides to do the next best thing. Jack brings up a great point about what will happen to the natives if Kong is taken from the island, but of course, being the capitalist that Fred is, he doesn't care. It is really sad actually how this all plays out in the end as well.Now something I never really thought of until I watched the documentary, Horror Noire, I can now see the racism that is inherently in this film. We have Kong, who is a beast. He is the representation of the black man in that there are a lot of people, even today, that think of them as less than human. Dwan is offered up to him, which there's a lot of conjuncture that they love white women. She is then taken against her will, while the rest of the white men go to save her. This does become a bit problematic though when Kong treats her good, aside from an odd rapey type scene. I do think that he means well, but being the animal he is, he truly doesn't know any better.I will say that the first time I saw this film, I found it to be boring. I don't necessarily agree after this viewing though. I do think that this film is a bit long. I understand there's a lot of story to tell and to go through, but I still feel like it can be trimmed down from what we get. I do like the social commentary we get and the updating of things like why they're going to the island. That really hits today even more so. The ending is sad, but it is fitting that Kong in this climbs the World Trade Center for allegorical reasons I'm sure.To shift this to the acting, I actually was quite impressed to be honest. I like the character that Bridges plays. I don't find himself to be as active as he is, but I can respect his viewpoints on what is happening here. He is a solid actor and this is a good performance. Grodin is such a slime ball, but I have to say, he plays it so well. He just fits these types of role so well. I found it interesting this is the first film debut for Lange, who is absolutely beautiful. It makes her even more intriguing is that she uses her sexual to her advantage, but this does hurt her relationship with Jack though. I liked to see camoes by Randolph, Auberjonois and Lauter, them with the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.Next would be the effects of the film, which I'm going to be honest they were pretty great. I had a hard time telling at times this wasn't a guy in a suit. I actually gave this viewing as part of a horror movie challenge, so I needed to watch one from Carlo Rambaldi who did some of the effects. I think Kong looks really good and the little blood we get does as well. The issue I had is with the giant snake we get, but it doesn't ruin anything. They were done practically and that's probably why I enjoy them. The setting is very cool on the island and it is shot well overall.Now with that said, I'm glad I gave this film another viewing, because it is better than I remember. It is a more modern retelling of the classic tale, which I liked. It has social commentary on capitalism as well as even taking a look at racism. The acting is really good here. The movie is a bit long though, but I will say that it still builds tension and the ending is sad. The effects are done practically which I like. Even though they all don't look good, that is solid in general. The soundtrack really didn't stand out, but it doesn't hurt the film. I think this film is above average. Not better than the original for me, but still enjoyable.",King Kong
52,Rob_Taylor,Man in rubber suit alert!,4,7 July 2003,"Yes, sadly its true. Not only true, but shockingly, totally and completely devoid of even the slightest hint of ""is it or isn't it?"" This movie was going OK right up until ""Kong"" appeared. Even for 1976, the effects here are pretty diabolical.Basically Kong is some guy in a monkey suit who, in their infinite wisdom, the film-makers of this atrocity believe will convince you he's a 50 foot ape. They even pulled their ace card out to help maintain and enhance the illusion......filming the guy in the suit from a low angle, so he appears bigger. Gasp! Oh the high-techness of it all!One wonders, in the original '33 version, whether the crew weighed up the pros and cons of trying to get away with a guy in a suit. I can almost see them doing a few test shots and reviewing the footage. They turn to one another, the mouth of one quivers, then they all fall about laughing. ""Man, this is too retarded! We'll never get away with that! Go with that new-fangled stop-motion stuff."" So quite why the '76 crew thought they could make it real is beyond comprehension.Further, the guy playing Kong, coupled with the dark makeup, had a rather unfortunate tendency to leer and letch maniacally throughout the film. The only recent actor I've seen do anything like this is Robert O'Reilly, who played (overacted gloriously) Chancellor Gowron from the ST:TNG and DS9 series. But in Kong's case, the effect is disturbing rather than humourous and you are left feeling rather unsettled.If it was only Kong, it might have been bearable, but all manner of ridiculous things crop up here that make you wonder if you're watching some student project. The trees wobble as ""Kong"" pushes through them in the most rubbery way and look about as convincing as the model trees I used to have for me train set as a kid. Then there are the sets. I'm sorry, but a poorly dressed sound stage will never convince me it's a tropical island, no matter how garish it looks. In order to add realism Dino and clan added some truly atrocious back-projected scenes, including ""The Mother of all Bad Back-Projection Scenes (tm)"" involving Kong atop the World Trade Centres with circling helicopters in the background. In some shots, the helicopters wobble and even fly backwards as they pass by in the background. Now that's flying!But my award for ""All-Time Lame-Ass Creature Effects"" goes to the stupefyingly un-lifelike snake that Kong fights (read as ""wraps himself up in unconvincingly""). I will never bad-mouth the snake in Anaconda again! It's perfection compared to this. What's worse, this snake is one of that rare breed of ophidians which is both a constrictor and a poisonous variety - an Anacobra. The snake is soooo bad. Trust me. I've seen draught excluders that look more lifelike.With the above emerging in all too terrifyingly real comic proportions, I quickly found the whole film an entertaining joy to watch. It's one of those ""They don't seriously expect us to buy this? Do they?"" movies that you have to keep watching just to see how awful it will get. And trust me, it gets pretty darn bad. Jeff Bridge's beard is shockingly unkempt in an uncaring Robinson Crusoe kind of way and Jessica Lange's character is so vapid that I kept hoping that someone....anyone...would slap her about a bit to get some kind of response other than the stat ""I'm cute, look at me"" routine she was locked into.If you're a fan of the original, watching this will be like having your teeth pulled. If you fancy a  beer-and-giggles evening then this movie has to be high on the list, if not No. 1 for bad movie-ness.Yet again a wonderful Dino de Horrendous production. Bravo!",King Kong

It's not a horrible movie, but I can say it is far from what I expected to be. First, I saw many errors and horrible effects that I couldn't believe that were used for such a famous movie! Even the wires can be seen holding the big mechanic Kong in one of the scenes! There are no dinosaurs on Kong's island,only a horrible rubber snake. I don't like Dwan as I liked Ann Darrow. The Kong of this movie is so artificial, and some scenes, like when he sees Dwan by the window were clear to me that it was a mechanical ape. Jackson's Kong respected the original has the same characters , the key events were the same, Kong looks much more realistic as an ape, and the relationship between Kong and Ann is much more interesting then the others.But there are some good things: I liked the ending of this movie,because is not a cliché. The character Jack is much more interesting in this version then the one from Peter Jackson's, that is a looser.Interesting page about King Kong, specially the one from this movie!;) http://www.pulpanddagger.com/canuck/kongpage6.html",King Kong
55,MartianOctocretr5,Primate level intelligence,4,14 June 2008,"It was 1976, and the movie makers thought they were too sophisticated to make King Kong the proud monarch of a mysterious island that encounters the brutality of human ""civilization"" with tragic results that we all knew from the 1933 classic. No, they decided to demote the once-formidable ape King to a court jester.For that matter, Ann (now named ""Dwan"" for absolutely no reason), Jack Driscoll (also with an unnecessary new name), and all the rest are portrayed as unevolved primates too. Gone is Kong's fearsomeness from the primitive black/white stop motion giant we once marvelled at; now we have an obvious rubber suit actor. Worse yet, Kong's hand is a clunky contraption that would make the audio-amnotron robots at Disney World cringe in embarrassment. It's such a pile of junk there are scenes where Lange actually has to jump into the thing to try to make it look like it's moving. Kong in color presents problems which the animators fail to address, but his paper mache cut-out appearance is the thing that really makes him look phony. His eyes roll left to right and back again in a bizarre manner that make the poor guy look like he just escaped a psycho ward, not Skull Island.The acting was so bad it could have been career ending for many actors. Just the same, Jessica Lange should hide in shame when viewers see her talking to Kong with a disco '76 sensibility (or lack of sensibility) and making trite jokes that should have inspired the great ape to squish her to shut her up. Unfortunately, this movie makes Kong a clod too, and he just reacts to Ann's poor acting with a few disco convulsions while those defective eyes of his spin around. As for Jeff Bridges: no comment.Updating the world's technology to the '70's served no purpose other than to remind you that this was a cheap remake, as if the flick's many other problems weren't enough to expose that fact. The movie's effort to marry an eco-friendly message about the animal kingdom with numerous lame attempts at topical humor just doesn't work. The script tries many ways to get you involved, and fails at all of them.In respect of the 1933 movie, I'll be generous and give this pretender a 4. At least it's entertaining in the sense you can laugh at how inept it is.",King Kong
56,dunmore_ego,Ape-tastrophe!,2,1 May 2008,"In any APE movie, the quality of the movie is entirely dependent on the Ape Effects: the original *King Kong* (1933) was a revolution in stop-motion special effects; *Mighty Joe Young* (1949) continued that legacy; 1968's *Planet of the Apes* boasted state-of-the-art creature makeup coupled with attentive simian performances; *Greystoke* (1984) pushed the limits of performance and makeup with Tarzan's ape cousins; Peter Jackson's 2005 *Kong* remake was a stunner on seamless effects. But in 1976, producer Dino de Laurentiis decided to go Godzilla on us by putting a guy in a gorilla suit Dja ever notice the ape extras in *Planet of the Apes* - those background chimps with the masks just placed loosely over their heads? Even they looked better than Dino's Kong.Directed by John Guillermin, the original Kong story is re-written limply for no reason by Lorenzo Semple Jr.; starring Jeff Bridges as a primate biologist (hairier than the eponymous ape star), Jessica Lange (playing the bimbo starlet as if constantly on the brink of orgasm) and a guy in an ape suit walking around like a guy in an ape suit.The saddest irony is that the guy in the ape suit is none other than RICK BAKER, renowned makeup artist  the maestro actually responsible for the innovative ape characters in *Greystoke*! (This was early in his career, at a point when he had only done makeup effects for a handful of films, two of which were featured on *Mystery Science Theater 3000*, which should indicate their ""quality."") To lower the bar even more, this movie actually won an Oscar for its ""visual effects"" - Special Achievement Award (read ""special"" as in Olympics).Charles Grodin plays the entrepreneur character that kidnaps Kong from his jungle island and brings him to America to advertise his oil company. Kong escapes. Cue Running-and-Screaming. In what is unintentionally the funniest scene, when Kong escapes, Grodin runs TOWARDS the ape and then lies on the ground screaming, with his arm warding off the camera zoom for a full ten seconds before Kong steps on him. Gotta love bad editing. In this version  where all the characters have been re-wrought for no special reason (well, maybe for that ""Special Olympics"" reason), Kong doesn't climb the Empire State but the World Trade Center buildings. Instead of biplanes, fighter jets shoot him down.Though it is reprehensible, *King Kong 1976* is still not as egregious as *King Kong Lives* (1986) - an actual sequel to THIS movie, where Linda Hamilton discovers Kong has lived after falling 110 storeys and gives him a giant heart transplant (donated from, uh, where?), whereupon Kong escapes with his chick (another giant gorilla  female) and goes on a rampage, walking around New York upright like a guy in an ape suit.Now isn't that special?!",King Kong
57,Maciste_Brother,Really bad!,2,22 July 2003,"After watching the woefully bad KING KONG remake, the thing that struck me was this: it continuously amazes me that John Barry keeps coming up with amazing scores for such amazingly bad films. How does he do it? Barry's score for KING KONG is not his greatest but it's still memorable, which is more than I can say for the entire film. KING KONG epitomizes everything that was so bad about that decade's crop of studio-produced blockbusters. It just bad on all front. The acting is cringe worthy : Jeff Bridges keeps running his hands in his long hair. Lange keeps her mouth open all the time. The FX are truly awful. The whole thing has a chintzy studio-bound look and feel that made the then super-expensive film look super cheap. Even Rob Bottin's KONG suit is unimpressive, certainly KONG's face, which appears to be frozen in a pinched expression that makes him look, well, unattractive. The characters behave in illogical or idiotic ways. For example, after surviving the subway train attack, where countless of people have been killed, and running away from an angry Kong, Dawn nonchalantly asks Jack to buy her a drink. Huh? But the thing that sinks this total fiasco is the dialogue. I've never heard such bad dialogue outside an Ed Wood film.'There is a girl out there who might be running for her life from some gigantic turned-on ape.""Or ""You're an Aries"" Dwan says to Jack. ""I can tell, from the shape of your earlobes.""BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!",King Kong
58,BrandtSponseller,Like Spielberg leaving milk out for two days in the Sahara,3,22 October 2006,"It's always fun to start a review by getting everyone p'ed off so they can get right to their ""not helpful"" vote and quickly move on, so here it is--if you are a big Steven Spielberg fan, there's a good chance you'll find this John Guillermin-directed version of King Kong entertaining, because all of the flaws typical of Spielberg are present here. In fact, as this Kong progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to believe that this wasn't really directed by Spielberg. You see, I'm not the biggest Spielberg fan. I don't exactly hate his work--heck, he's even produced a decent number of 10s in my book, but more often than not, I find Spielberg annoying. He has good, interesting core ideas--and I'm thinking here of the obvious stylistic hand he has in his film's premises and stories--but he usually ruins them with ham-handed direction. It's common during a Spielberg film that the longer it goes on, the more I can't wait for it to end. That's exactly how I felt with King Kong.Actually, I was prepared to give this version about a 6 for maybe the first hour or so. As others have noted, the story follows the far superior 1933 King Kong very closely, with some changes to make it more socially relevant and ironic for the mid 1970s. Those aren't bad, and in some cases, they're very good. The mystery of Skull Island, King Kong's native land, is maybe handled even better here than in the original. The ""paranormal"" fog was a great idea (the ""normal"" explanations for it a bit more loopy). The Hawaiian location certainly looked impressive. The mystery of the soon-to-be-screaming hot babe--in this case portrayed by Jessica Lange, in her debut as the ridiculously named ""Dwan""--was an improvement over the original, too, as in the original, it seemed like maybe not much thought was put into the premise behind getting Fay Wray's character on the ship (even though Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack did marvelous things with the premise later, unlike Guillermin's feat of losing all his potential here).But the problems begin taking over by the time Kong appears. Kong looks very fake. It's obvious that it's a guy in a monkey suit, aided by an animatronic mask and a giant robot arm and hand. Of course, Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation in the original is obviously fake, too, but there, Harryhausen's work has a fantastical charm, and more importantly, it never breaks the flow of the film. In this version, it's difficult to watch without thinking about how each Kong shot was done. The film has a very uneven look. Studio shots poorly match the atmosphere of location shots. Rear projection techniques are blatant. Sometimes the foreground action isn't positioned very well relative to the rear projection. The big mechanical hand just looks like a big mechanical hand, and Guillermin milks it until big stinky chunks pour out instead.Still, that might not have to kill the film. If you know me, you know I don't require realism at all. And I can use my imagination to fill in the blanks and rough edges. But at the same time that the look of the film is going to hell and the seams are beginning to show, two other problems begin appearing. One, what seemed like a slightly cheesy and clunky but still somewhat charming script goes from a semi-polished draft to pages that must have been transcribed straight from barroom napkins to the shooting script. Increasingly, dramatic developments make no sense and the dialogue keeps getting more ridiculous. That never ends. It just keeps getting more problematic until the end of the film. In conjunction with this, the performances begin to go off the rails. Guillermin suddenly has everyone begin overacting. That never ends either.Just like the seams begin to show on effects shots, the seams begin falling apart more generally on a directorial level. Scenes that have little logical connection to the story are obviously inserted just for ""dramatic impact""--things like odd reaction shots, odd behavior, and so on. Guillermin has everyone overact for these, of course, and he seems to have printed rough takes. Adding insult to injury, these are then edited so that they begin too soon and end too late. For scenes that should have had dramatic impact, such as Fred Wilson's (Charles Grodin) final encounter with Kong, we again get stinky chunks of milk, with too many badly edited/timed reaction shots of Grodin, so that most of the audience will be wondering why he wouldn't just get up and run away, given the 3 or 4 minutes that he seems to have.Far too much of the film is written in one of the more well-defined senses of ""contrived""--people end up where they do just so the script can continue. There's little reason to their behavior beyond that. For example, Dwan ends up endangering herself just because that scene needs to be there to create a little tension. Kong finds people in New York City as if they had a huge flashing neon sign advertising their location, just because Kong needs to find them so they can all get to the next scene. Again, these missteps never end until the film does.Other than those odd folks who think that Spielberg is a consistent genius, it's difficult for me to actually recommend this King Kong to anyone except maybe for huge fans of these actors. Lange is certainly attractive in the film in her various outfits designed to be revealing in very specific ways, but even that is robbed of some of its libidinal value by the ""obvious contrivance"" factor. Whether you're a big fan of King Kong films or just casually interested, this version is the last place to head for a Kong fix.",King Kong
59,TheUnknown837-1,the legend reborn but not in the best way,7,27 June 2007,"It's too bad, because when I look at the 1976 remake of ""King Kong"", and I look over its good traits that can't be ignored, I think that if only the rest of the movie was as spectacular, then this would undoubtedly be my favorite out of all three versions. And it's true that the 76 version has some qualities and characteristics are simply beautiful and perfect, yet there are other aspects that can't be ignored and ultimately ruin the movie for many viewers. This is probably the worst out of all three versions. I'm not saying its a terrible film or a total failure, but it was a missed opportunity.There were some great aspects to ""King Kong"", mostly its first-rate cinematography and John Barry's fantastic music score. Performances by all of the cast members, excluding Jessica Lange in some scenes, were great. Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin were excellent in their roles. And Jessica Lange was great for her debut, for about five minutes into the film. Afterward, I kind of got annoyed by her. Maybe it wasn't her performance that bothered me, but just the character's dialogue and irritating antics. Her character smoking, acting like a bimbo, and trying to make conversation with a gorilla, just totally made this character nothing when compared to the respectable Ann Darrow from the original.Another thing about the film that did not work was Kong himself. Kong is portrayed in all of his scenes by a man in a rubber suit. And, when comparing it to 1976 technology, the suit looked good from the waist up. But from the waist down, it was totally campy and revealing. The overhead shots of Kong walking through the jungle, shots Kong climbing buildings, and fighting on top of skyscrapers were all painful to look at. At times, I could see points of the suit folding in. Thankfully, there were at least good animatronics in the head to create a somewhat realistic approach. To be honest, the only reason the suit looks passable is thanks to Richard H. Kline's skill as a cinematographer. And unfortunately, ""King Kong"" doesn't have the great action sequences I wanted. I wouldn't have minded seeing the man in the monkey suit fighting with other creatures, but it was disappointing to discover that the only creature he battles is one that was also poorly executed as a special effect and the fight itself was short, out of place, and almost unnecessary. The only way I could consider it ""thrilling"" is thanks to John Barry's thunderous, booming music score.Putting aside the two main parts about this movie that bothered me: Jessica Lange's character and the poorly done visual effects on Kong, the movie itself was pretty fun to watch. Once upon a time, I hated this version of ""King Kong"" and refused to watch it. But over time, I grew to like it some. There are still some parts that make me wince, but overall, it's a worthy movie experience.",King Kong
60,mstomaso,"Huge Budget, Effort and Ape - Good for what it is",7,14 March 2008,"Dino Di Laurentis' production of King Kong was a very bold move. De Laurentis was at the height of his career, having produced several successful and risky blockbusters throughout the 1970s. But the original 1933 film was an improbable masterpiece and is one of the best loved films in the American canon. The writer/director of the original - Merian C. Cooper was a relative unknown who would use Kong to launch a lengthy and acclaimed career including a number of great films traversing a number of film genres. The cast was certainly not a bunch of unknowns, but none of them had ever made a film remotely resembling this science fiction romantic adventure. There is no sense in describing the plot - it's very well known and you can find synopses elsewhere.So, director John Guilerman applied a huge special effects and casting budget and went to work on yet another De Laurentis monster-sized Hollywood film. Guilerman was a good match for De Laurentis. Fresh out of his successful ""Towering Inferno"" Irwin Allen disaster flick, Guilerman was ready for the challenge King Kong would give him.Wisely, he chose to stick to the original story line very closely- just changing a few of the details for the purpose of modernization. Also wisely, his casting director, the short-lived but excellent Joyce Selznick, chose actors and actresses who fit the roles established by the 1933 film with minimal alteration. - Jeff Bridges can do just about anything he sets his mind to. Charles Grodin is great at playing an ambiguously evil bumbler, Rene Auberjonois makes an excellent awkward sci-guy, and Jessica Lange (a relative unknown at the time) is stunningly beautiful and very talented. I will digress for just a moment to discuss Ms. Lange's performance. Women do not really fair very well as a class of people in either of these two films. In the original most of Faye Wray's lines consisted of screaming and wailing. The 1976 script gave Lange's character considerably more depth, but some will cringe at Lange's very provocative performance, the implication when she is discovered at the beginning of the film that she may have ended up in sex slavery had her boat not been wrecked, and the obviously exploitive and wholly unnecessary brief nude scenes. Yes... but... Lange's character (infused with the actress' remarkable sincerity) manages to develop a strength and power that Wray's character lacked, and you will have to see this film to get it.The cinematography is lavish, but very often - wisely - matches the original scene for scene. The special effects are - for their time - miraculous. Kong is just as humanized, if not more-so, as he was in the original.My only criticism is one that applies very often to big-budget Hollywood adventure and effects movies, and more specifically, to some of De Laurentis' productions of the period and which makes this film noticeably different from the original. The tempo of the 1976 King Kong caters to the typical cinema-goer's attention span. The film breezes along without very much variation in pacing, and therefore misses some opportunities to properly exploit drama and suspense. However, this critique only examines the difference between a good film and what could have been a great film, so..... enjoy! Recommended.",King Kong
61,gizmomogwai,Behold! The not-so-mighty Pauper Kong!,4,1 June 2013,"Being a big fan of King Kong (1933) since I was a kid and a fan of King Kong (2005) since it came out, I've long been curious to see the 1976 version. Although pictures of Kong from this movie looked awful and I suspected it would be the worst of the King Kongs, as a Kong fan it seemed right that I'd at least see it. I now have, and I was more or less right about it.Unlike the other two versions, this one is set in the '70s, and instead of a film crew, the expedition to Skull Island is looking for oil. They stupidly invest a lot into the oil that it turns out is unusable. Along the way, they pick up a stowaway primatologist (rather convenient) and a shipwrecked bimbo Dwan (Jessica Lange). So this movie robs us many of the characters (and all of the dinosaurs) we know and loved. And why would an oil company bring back a giant monkey to New York for stage shows? Rewriting the story to take out the entertainers didn't quite go smoothly.Again, Kong looks awful- a man in a monkey suit. It must be embarrassing when a 1976 film is soundly defeated in special effects by a 1933 one. Dwan was attractive (though no Fay Wray or Naomi Watts), but when we have her shower scene and see her bare hips, for the life of me I couldn't figure out why that was necessary. What's much worse, I couldn't believe the sheer stupidity of her line, ""You goddamn chauvinistic pig ape! You want to eat me? Go ahead!"" I guess it was the production quality that made her suicidal.The only reason why parts of the movie were enjoyable was because they were taken from the brilliant original. King Kong '76 itself brings nothing worthwhile to the table. And so, it wouldn't be until 2005 that we finally got the remake we deserved- and Kong could regain some of his dignity.",King Kong
62,vip_ebriega,Campy but irresistible B-grade remake.,5,22 May 2008,"My Take: A campy remake that's quite a bad movie, but quite hard to truly dislike. No one said it would be a good idea to remake a film that a.) had nothing going wrong with or b.) if there's no innovation it needs or you can give it. So why remake KING KONG in 1976? Who knows? This big-budgeted (although it seems hard to see why) but extremely goofy remake of the classic monster movie is heavily (and I mean heavily) flawed, but sometimes, you just fall in love with a film that tries to be something and fails. If this is a bad movie I must agree, but it's actually quite watchable (but that really depends on how you look at the thing). Changing everything from characters and plot, the film is a loose remake of the first film. Instead of bringing back the characters of the original, this film spawns new characters. The male lead is now named Jack Prescott (played by a young Jeff Bridges), a stowaway who unwittingly joins an expedition of the Petrox oil company, lead by a Fred Wilson (a pre-comedian Charles Grodin) who goes in search of an island where there is supposed to be an expensive kind of oil that could earn them millions. Instead of Fay Wray screaming it all over again as Ann Darrow, this remake casts a new female star to play a different character. This actress is none other than a very young Jessica Lange, in her memorable screen debut, and she plays Dwan, a shipwrecked girl. Lange is fun to watch as she ball clowns in her role.What happens later is all to familiar to you. The girl is kidnapped by the natives and offered as a sacrificial bride to their god Kong, who instantly falls for the captive maiden. Kong here is no longer a stop-motion model as the original Kong was in 1933, and is replaced with a stunt man in a gorilla suit. This is created by Rick Baker, who is also the guy sweating it out inside the suit. The effects look really goofy, even for its age. It's like those goofy man-in-a-suit monsters starring in those Toho films from Japan. The acting, even for the appealing Ms. Lange, is awfully weak. The screenplay, by Lorenzo Semple Jr., is pretty weak and takes itself too seriously with not much evident fun.But still, I found it hard to hate this goofy old movie. Although I couldn't really say I liked it, you got to admit it took a lot of guts to be made! Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",King Kong
63,Mister-6,"""King"" of the remakes...",7,30 January 2000,"Okay, I'll admit that I was a kid when I first saw this so this review is done wearing rose-colored glasses.  But having seen this '76 remake of ""King Kong"", my opinion hasn't changed much: it's still great!  Maybe not the equal of the original, but how could it be?  It does well enough in its own behalf.The music grabs you right off: John Barry did aces with his pounding, dramatic score.  And you couldn't ask for a better cast; Lange does okay for a first role, Bridges makes linear-thought acting look easy and Grodin is about as slimy a baddie as you could ask for.  The bit parts are also filled with familiar faces (Bernsen, Piscopo, Auberjoinois, Lauter, Randolph and Lone) who acquit themselves quite well.A lot of people blast the monkey suit.  But I think Rick Baker did a good job with it.  Of COURSE it's a guy in a monkey suit, but it's a guy in a WELL-DONE monkey suit.  It still gets me when Kong blew-dry Dwan (Lange after her waterfall shower); those puffed-out cheeks, especially in 1976, were high tech enough for me (remember, this was before ""Star Wars"" came out).But we all know how the story works; any of us who have a rudimentary knowledge of the original, that is.  The new twist was having the emotional connection between Lange and ape.  More enlightened than having her scream endlessly.  The Twin Towers scene near the end was not only exciting but quietly moving, as it showed just how much the beast cared for his beauty.There's plenty of corn in this one, no argument, but it's corn for a good cause.  I loved ""King Kong"" and if I had a chance, I'd buy a copy!  Anyone have John Guillermin's phone number?Seven stars for ""Kong""; long live the ""King""!",King Kong

Sneaking aboard the vessel is Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), a paleontologist, interested in the rumor surrounding the island.

I thought it was a brilliant updating of the original scenario into the then-contemporary world (when you change plans from oil discovery to ape-capture, you simply call for an airdrop; the island is discovered via illicit satellite pictures, not a hearsay map drawn by a dying man), and for me it has the emotional punch that the original just doesn't have.I was terribly disappointed when I finally saw the Cooper/Schoedsack version after enjoying this so much, since I'd heard for so long how much better it was: I was really enjoying the start, but then about halfway through it suddenly lost interest in all the characters and turned into an SFX orgy. The ""Beauty and the Beast"" phrase is constantly overworked, so that by the time you get to the famous last line you've heard it so often you're just tired of it; it could have been effective if they'd done it just once or twice. Fay Wray (who was a fine actress in the couple of other films of hers I've seen) is just wasted, spending more time showing her legs than showing her talent, and Bruce Cabot is simply not romantic-lead material. The one character I still liked by the end was Denham himself, and I was glad to see him show up in the sequel -- which I liked much better, being as it had far more human story and far fewer monster-fights!(It was interesting seeing the 1933 ""King Kong"" again after the Merian C. Cooper documentary, though, and spotting the autobiographical in-jokes!)I don't 'get' the critique that the film's politics are outdated, unless the suggestion is that oil companies don't have their share of ambitious underlings: the girl Dwan could have passed for a satire on today's I'm a Celebrity/Reality TV culture, and I'm told that primate protection is a hotter issue than ever... Actually, I liked Dwan (as a character, not as a person! Although she does come across as more sympathetic when she's interacting with the ape.) The whole astrology obsession/pretentious name/gratuitous body-flashing thing was a pretty accurate -- and hence funny -- take-off of Females I Have Known, and yet she is a recognisably real human being underneath all the man-catching trappings, with enough imagination to suffer.Most of the attacks on the film I've seen, when you get down to it, are along the lines of ""how dare they? they changed the *plot*!"" Which seems to me to be missing the whole point of a re-make, or of the only kind that's worth doing, anyhow: to take the heart of the story and retell it in a way that's new and yet the same. In remaking ""King Kong"", they took a plot that didn't work for me, cut out almost all the bits that didn't work -- no random dinosaurs as Kong fails his wandering monsters roll, no single convenient escape-vine dangling over the edge of his clifftop hideaway, no ape close-ups with rolling eye-whites, no endless 'beauty and the beast' -- cleverly updated the scenario to make the myth of the thing amazingly plausible in a modern world, and above all managed to retain the character interest all the way through. Not to mention making Kong a genuinely sympathetic creature as well as a terrifying one, and creating a biting and tragic finale.Where I thought it failed, ironically enough, was in two scenes that were a direct homage to the original. The scene where Kong rolls the log looked much more fake than all the surrounding footage, and it seemed very cursorily done: this was one of the few scenes I found effective in the original 'chase' sequence, and here it seemed very two-dimensional. And the single monster-fight that they did retain, with the inexplicable weird-headed snake, was not only unconvincing but felt as gratuitous as its predecessor (which was at least better choreographed!) It must surely have been apparent during filming that this wasn't working -- couldn't they have come up with some more imaginative way of distracting Kong at the vital moment?",King Kong
67,FloatingOpera7,Almost A Great Re-Make But the 2005 Kong Is Better,7,3 April 2006,"Stars Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, John Randolph, Renee Auberjonois, Julius Harris, Jack O'Halloran.Released in 1975, this film is the first of two remakes of the classic 1933 King Kong, the second and latest being Peter Jackson's 2005 King Kong. The B budget film director from Italy, Dino Di Lorentis (2000 years B.C.) is behind the production for this version and that's probably why this film failed miserably. To this day, most people regard this film as a really bad re-make, most notably in King Kong himself, an actor in an ape suite. There are times one forgets its a guy in a costume (like the scene when he abducts a shrunken Anne played by Jessica Lange) but often times we know its a guy in costume such as the scene when he wreaks havoc in New York City. Jessica Lange plays Anne in an entirely different manner than Fay Wray, who screams throughout most of the original film. Instead of being scared of Kong and clearly a victim, Jessica Lange portrays her as a woman who takes on a kind of liberal's interest in the ""endangered"" ape and has genuine feelings for him. She is subdued, charming and sexy and doesn't scream at all. I like the scene in which she explains how she was saved from drowning from the ship she was taking on a filming shoot. The crew had invited her to see the classic 70's porno film ""Deep Throat"", she refused and consequently was saved during the shipwreck. Jeff Bridges has great chemistry with Lange and he, too, is liberal at heart and likes the great big ugly ape, too. This is probably because the 70's was a time when environmentalists, ""tree-huggers"" and animal activists were blooming. This movie is a document of New York City in the 70's. The cinematography is lovely. I didn't give this movie a really low rating because it has its moments. The island is gorgeous. There's a scene in which Lange showers underneath a waterfall. The use of the Twin Towers in place of the Empire State Building is also a nice touch, and a sort of film tribute to those precious towers that were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001. While this is not the best re-make, this is still a so-so movie. But without question the best is Peter Jackson's newest release.",King Kong
68,tomimt,Remastered version is needed,5,1 January 2006,"Here's a film that hasn't aged well. It is actually aged quite badly: the difference between Kong and the trick shoots are so painfully obvious that it's pretty distracting, as you see this blueish tint in every trick scene. It's not even charming as it's in the original '33 version of the film.I just saw this film recently from the TV, and it was quite obvious that at least that version wasn't remastered and cleaned, as the picture quality resembled bad VHS tape copy. Actually, the film itself wouldn't be that bad, it's actually just average, as some people make it out to be, but it would take some image cleaning and remastering.One thing is pretty clear from the start: Kong is a man in an ape suit. That wouldn't actually matter much, if the actor would even try to move like a gigantic ape, but he doesn't. instead he walks like a man in an ape suit and that pretty much succeeds in breaking up the illusion of a great ape.The plot line is almost the same as in the original: white man go island, white girl gets caught by an ape, white man catches the ape. This time it's just an oil company looking for oil instead of filmmakers. The company want's Kong in their commercials. Jessica Lange play Dawn, the Kong's new love object and Jeff Bridges is Jack, the good guy trying to save her and in the end the ape. Acting is okay as such, a bit pompous and unintentionally funny in some places. It's just, that when you take out the dinosaurs the film isn't as exiting as the original.",King Kong
69,the red duchess,The most radical film of the 1970s?,1,6 February 2001,"'King Kong' is one of the notorious flops in Hollywood history, a species less rare than a berserk, lovelorn gorilla in the late 70s.  'Heaven's Gate' has taught me to ignore history and the public (a certain minor folly in 1941 was also loudly fanfared and loudly ignored); while David Thomson advised me that 'Kong' was actually a sophisticated black comedy.  I am not as intelligent as Mr. Thomson, so I wasn't able to find any of this humour, which, considering it features a giant primate who can understand English and loves a bad Marilyn impersonator, is pretty impressive. 
Whatever potency the material had in the early days of sound, when novel spectacle excused poor acting and worse plotting, surely in the late 1970s it was ripe for ridicule, the full-on camp treatment.  But no, the filmmakers go for an admirable earnestness, and not even the kind of po-face that seems silly.  Everything is played unnervingly straight, even the curious central love affair, so there is not even sneering relief.  In fact, there is very little adaptation of the original material, making it seem eerily old-fashioned in in the age of 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars' - even the 'special' effects have that clunky black-screen mismatching of live action and animation so familiar from early fantasy films.  'Kong''s satire and critique moves from vague anti-colonialism to a more obvious (and more hypocritical, or did everyone give their pay-check to the poor?) anti-capitalism, with the big game hunters of Victorian mythology replaced by oil interests, consciously (if erroneously) modelling themselves on 'great' conquistadors of the past.  This pinpointing of American globalisation/colonialism is welcome from Hollywood in the 1970s, especially in the light of its obscene foreign policy record of that time; Guillermin links its aggression to the kind of large-scale showbiz razzledazzle that, even today, throws enough glitter and noise at the people to prevent them from thinking; and to sexual inadequacy, repression and neurosis. 
Kong is a giant, distinctive beast with a material reality; but he is also an embodiment of the sexual frustrations of all the aggressive men on the boat, far away from home and a bordello, with a woman on board they'd love to ravish, but are too 'civilised' to try.  More particularly, he is Jack Prescott's Id, the bestial urges of the scientist who on three occasions comes close to having sex with Dwan, and each time is frustrated.  This link is made explicit when she gives Kong the same star sign as Prescott. 
The film seems to be suggesting that if America minded its own business a little more, stopped trying to hoodwink and bully every little nation that got in its way or didn't fall on its knees in gratitude, and spent a little more time making love, the world would be a better place.  These hippy sentiments do not preclude rather old-fashioned racial stereotypes repeated to the extent where the island people actually disappear from the screen after their plot work is done, and they've sacrificed Dwan.  There's nothing inherently wrong with 'Kong'; there have been far less intelligent films that have made fortunes.  I just found it a little dull.",King Kong
70,gigan-92,This one Stunk,4,27 January 2011,"the 1976 re-make, what a painful adaptation and probably the worst. Even though Jeff Bridges was in it, and even a nipple slip of all things on the part of Jessica Lange, this film was a bore. I'm a die-hard fan of monster movies, and have the utmost respect for the gods of the genre like the original 1954 ""Gojira"", the original ""King Kong"", and ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". And I've sat threw rummage like ""Gamera vs. Viras"" and ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"". but at least even the really grimy parts of monster history didn't fail in at least delivering some action. This film, good lord, I could barely sit through. There's a whole lot of pointless exposition, and when we finally get to Skull Island we see so little of it was such a disappointment. So much of the original story was raped and done away with what was meant to replace is crap.the first film and the 2005 re-make use Skull Island to instill a sense of mystery and terror to our audience, and the feeling is reversed when Kong is in our own concrete jungle. But all Kong did on Skull Island was fight a giant python marionette, and I'm all for marionettes, in fact I love Toho for their practical effects as opposed to CGI...but..nothing else happens!! then Kong gets captured, whup tee do. Where was the Tyrannosaurus, the Pterosaurs, the Stegosaurus, the f*ckin dinosaurs??!! And Ms. Lange was so uninvolved, I just didn't care about their romantic scenes of her with Kong.And the score failed to really do anything for me. Many of Akira Ifukube's works have far grander compositions for films widely regarded as mediocre compared to American entertainment. This my fellow reviewers, is evidence of just an epic fail.",King Kong
71,LebowskiT1000,Better Than I Expected,7,24 February 2002,"Given that this film was made in 1976, I thought it was a very good movie. Some of the visual effects were actually pretty good (maybe not compared to today's standards, but still good) and some of the shots must have been very complicated shots.  The only complaint I have is the look of ""Kong"", mainly his face, it just didn't look right.  Sometimes it looked pretty good, but other times I thought it just looked horrible.  Also, there were a number of times that you could tell it was obviously just a man in a suite.  This would be a great candidate for a remake with all the advances in special effects that we have today.As far as acting goes, I thought all the actors did a great job.  It was really cool to see Jeff Bridges (who will be forever known as ""The Dude"" to me...from ""The Big Lebowski"" if you didn't know) in one of his first films. Jessica Lange looked absolutely incredible in this film, and did a fine job of acting.  It was also cool to see Charles Grodin in one of his earlier films.All in all, I thought it was a pretty good film, and it's definitely something you should see if you're into the sci-fi genre, cause there are so many films that reference this film (and the original) that you may as well find out what their referencing.  Anyhow, thanks for reading,-Chris",King Kong
72,EmperorNortonII,Another Look At the Great Ape,7,27 March 2004,"Dino DeLaurentiis' remake of ""King Kong"" was about as good as could be expected.  This movie, a re-imagining of the original story from 1933, puts sort of an environmental spin on it.  This version tries to be more sympathetic to the giant gorilla.  Jessica Lange as Dwan tries to see beneath the monstrous exterior to find a soul.  meanwhile, Charles Grodin as Petrox oil shark Fred Wilson just wants to exploit Kong.  This all leads to the climax at the World Trade Center.  Nothing against the Twin Towers, but many of us prefer to see King Kong climbing the Empire State Building.  That remains an indelible pop culture image.  Anyway, here's hoping that Peter Jackson's upcoming take on ""King Kong"" can do the justice that Dino DeLaurentiis could not.",King Kong

A terrific and creative set-up with the famous story altered so that oil speculator Charles Grodin is seeking the island surrounded by fog as a possible origin for that gushy stuff that keeps cars running...Jeff Bridges, as a ""hippie"" stowaway who bribes his way aboard the ship/freighter, knows the island has a big secret, and yet even he's not sure exactly what... Had another actor been cast in this preachy photographer role, liking and even thinking he understands simians over humans (especially the 11th hour American Military in Copters that he infamously cheers upon their destruction), would be annoying and/or pretentious, even cliché: Given his cred, it's no surprise that Bridges can be just cool enough to add a tinge of pulpy action hero to the hairy modern do-gooder...And after what are the best scenes occurring on-the-way to Skull Island, he's part of, along with the mostly doomed search party on land that includes character-actors Ed Lauter and Julius Harris, the same kind of old school adventure vibe, keeping the action at a neat, economical pace: something director John Guillerman can do nicely. ranging from SHAFT IN AFRICA back to THE DAY THEY ROBBED THE BANK OF ENGLAND...In search of the initially lost-at-sea and now reluctant monkey's bride is a would-be actress with the strange name of Dwan, played by the extremely gorgeous Jessica Lange, an airhead character who probably wouldn't have made a good actress, so Jessica's own performance may seem stilted and campy, but like Bridges, her unique presence makes-up for any otherwise damaging flaws. ""My horoscope said I was in crossover water,"" she says about the powerful man who can possibly change her life with a big role, and, unaware of the underlined irony that waits ashore, continues with: ""And that I was going to meet the biggest person in my life.""Skull Island more a tropical Hawaii than the original's African vibe
Meanwhile, Grodin, with his usual glib persona, is a snarky, funny and likeable villain (whose forced selfish dialogue fleshes-out any and all villainy), and at one point says ""Let's not get eaten alive on this island... Bring the mosquito spray!"" And he's ultimately not as lucky as Robert Armstrong's original instigator, Carl Denham: after all, Hollywood prefers directors to oilmen...But this entertainingly epic yet nicely contained popcorn flick hits a gigantic Kong Wall, ironically when the Ape arrives and the story centers on he and Lange's idyllic honeymoon that's not only corny, but makes this formidable creature lack the complete and edgy, monstrous quality needed for his Big Apple destruction later on (but at least he doesn't ice skate like in Peter Jackson's multi-million-dollar vanity project). Kong is also inevitably bogged down by dated special effects... despite beautiful matte painting backdrops and Rick Baker's costume (Bridges says at one point: ""Who do you think went through there: some guy in an ape suit?""), which seems genuine and palpable up-close as opposed to wider shots, the opposite of the 1933 classic - still the champ after all the sequels, remakes, expanded tales and in this particular case, with the working tag-title extension THE LEGEND REBORN, is one of the first reboots despite that term not being used (much) in 1976, one year before effects-driven pulpy adventure movies would be changed, forever.",King Kong

Wow... it's amazing how inept special effects could be in those days! Did they shoot *any* footage on a real island? Is anyone watching this movie able to accept for even one minute that ""Kong"" is anything but a guy in a mangy gorilla suit? (Except for the one or two shots of a hopelessly fake-looking immobile statue that they use towards the end.) The actors do their best... Jeff Bridges plays the long-haired rebel hero about as well as it could be done... and Charles Grodin does okay as the villainous oil man who tries to exploit Kong.

Still, she does look quite attractive in those skimpy costumes that keep falling off of her body... and obviously, that was all the producers cared about.

79,theshadow908,"Terrible, yet slightly entertaining.",4,13 June 2006,"This version of King Kong destroys everything the original worked for. It tells the story of a selfish oil baron who travels to Skull Island to find oil, but instead finds natives and a giant gorilla. On the way to the island, they find a young woman stranded at sea who they pick up. The natives offer her to the giant gorilla, and the oil crew heads deeper into the island to get her back, and to capture Kong for monetary gain back in New York. This is a newer, more modern version of the Kong story, yet it still doesn't hold up to the 33 original.The first thing this movie does wrong is changes the plot and characters around so that it doesn't even fit into the King Kong mythos. The second thing it does wrong is puts a man in a monkey suit in the role of Kong. The original movie had primitive claymation effects, but even that is better than a Kong who walks and acts like a man, because it's a man in a suit. Whereas the special effects in the 30s movie were state of the art for the time, they use special effects in this movie that is ages behind what the 70s should be. A guy in a gorilla suit and cartoon explosions does not make a good action movie. This movie doesn't even flow the same as the original. The pacing is really off in some scenes. However, I will say that some scenes involving Kong, particularly the end New York scene, are mildly entertaining and worthy of a ""guilty pleasure"" viewing.The acting is okay as well. The dialogue is somewhat better in this version, and Jeff Bridges plays a good hero. Jessica Lange is good in her first ever role. Charles Grodin plays a surprisingly rotten character and does very well at it. I kind of enjoyed how Jessica Lange realized toward the end that Kong is just an animal and doesn't deserve to die, as opposed to the original where the female lead is scared of Kong right up to the closing scene.Overall, this isn't a good movie, but the acting is okay and there are a few mildly entertaining scenes.4.5/10",King Kong
80,curtis-8,"One of the Most Brilliant Films of the 70s--no, really!",9,20 January 2005,"King Kong (1976) King Kong was a huge hit back in the seventies--I know because I was there, I saw the frenzy, I remember the crowded theaters. Now, admittedly, it also had a huge pr campaign, which undoubtedly helped it garner a lot of that dough, but there was a lot more to the flick than just the hype. And it could have probably been an even bigger hit if the filmmakers had played it safe and hadn't gone out of their way to make a film so stubbornly odd. I mean this thing stomps over a gigantic swath of styles: panoramic spectacle, high adventure, pathos, romance, social commentary, absurdist comedy, thrills, and occasionally outright goofiness--all comprised in a slyly satiric package designed to tweak the noses of Kong purists. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s (""Papillon "") screenplay is all over the place when it comes to style and tone, borrowing from whatever and whenever, almost as though it had been patched together from several different treatments--yet it still remains incredibly tight in terms of interesting, well-drawn, consistent characters, witty dialog, exploration of theme, and the forward momentum of the plot. King Kong 76 is a great example of anarchic postmodernism being perfectly wed to the staunch formalism of good storytelling. A contemporary example of this approach would be Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films.The direction by veteran John Guillermin was absolutely fearless, pushing each of Semple's concepts to its limit, even at the risk of seeming silly. And he had a great cast to work with, especially young Jessica Lange in her first film role. Unfortunately, Jessica played the role of the vivacious, childlike, kinda dimwitted bubblehead blonde Dwan so incredibly well that most people wrote her off, assuming she was just a dumb blonde playing herself. But in actuality it is a bravura performance, one of the best in her career, and certainly a more individual, more fully-realized character performance than we get in most movies these days.As big a hit as the disco era Kong was, however, there were a lot of people who were put off because they weren't expecting anything as freewheeling and insane as what they were given. They weren't expecting weirdness and satire. They weren't expecting to see Kong blowing a hot, wet blonde dry after a dip in a lake (metaphors anyone?), a scene simultaneously erotic and ridiculous. They weren't expecting to see the captured Kong turned in to a corporate shill--is there any scene in mainstream 70s cinema more surrealistically satiric than that of Kong being presented to the masses encased in a thirty story replica of a gasoline pump? They also were not expecting to see a big budget adventure film with a downer ending--the romantic leads ending up emotionally separated by their experiences instead of united. And they didn't expect to feel bad when the monster died.So I put it to you all that not only was the 1976 Kong a financial success, it was also an artistic success. But you can't watch it as a remake of a classic film. It is no more a remake of the 1933 King Kong than Quentin's Kill Bill is a remake of Sonny Chiba's Streetfighter's Revenge. Watch the film for what it is, not what you think it should have been, or what you wanted it to be, and you will be better able to appreciate its cracked brilliance.",King Kong
81,jerekra,Awful When Compared To The Classic Original.,5,4 February 2009,"King Kong is a remake of the classic 1933 King Kong film. While special effects and technology could allow for a much better looking film, the classic is much better than this film is.Unlike the original, in this film the expedition across the ocean to Kong Island is not to find Kong. Instead they are looking for a fuel source or something but instead they find King Kong.King Kong looks OK in this film. He is portrayed somewhat similar to the original Kong, however this Kong is able to become friends of sorts with Dwan(female blonde in this film rather than Ann).One thing wrong with this film is the time it takes for Kong to appear. The whole boat ride over is bad since only one guy on the boat knows that Kong is on the island that they are heading towards. Kong also does not get into much action in a good way and I think he moves too slow and robotic like. This Kong may look good but the origainl stop motion one got to do a hell of a lot more than this one.The second main thing wrong with this film is that there are NO DINOSAURS! One of the major reasons for the original being so great was all of the dinosaurs that were on Skull Island but in this film the only creature in the film other than Kong is a giant snake.I did like Jessica Lange in this film. She did a good job and is also pretty hot. THe scene where Kong tries to strip her clothes off is pretty awesome. Also you get to see her in the shower but you do not really see anything.King Kong looks good in this film but the lack of dinosaurs and action make it an average film at best. I probably overrated it just because of Jessica Lange. It is worth seeing once though at the very least.",King Kong
82,swedzin,It's not that bad.,7,8 October 2012,"I don't usually like remakes, but for this one, I'll make an exception. As you know... the 1933 original version was really something special, something amazing, and how do you expect for remake to beat it. It can't, it's impossible. But this film, it has something solid in it. After 43 years later, this film has some particular details from the original version (original was powerful even back then). The idea about ""beauty and beast"" is more distinctive than before (because in the original, the leading lady was scared and only did screaming) and it was set in the 70s for some necessary reason and I think that worked well.John Guillermin did a solid job on this film, but I think that the edge lies within adorable Jessica Lange (who plays the bride of Kong), she was for reason chosen for the role, because her beauty and acting talent were immense for this version. Now, other actors... Jeff Bridges (who plays an primate paleontologist Jack), he did a good job, but some reason... I could not stop laughing, every time I see him, because he reminds me of a Dude Lebowski :D. So that's what Dude did before some leaked at his rug... Charles Grodin as a wealthy oil company business, he was good at his terrain John Randolph and Rene Auberjonois were also good, and to mention bit parts like Julius Harris (the deep voiced, menacing dude, who played Bond villain Tee Hee), Jack O'Halloran (the superman enemy Non) and always supporting actor Ed Lauter, who was good.Now, for the Kong... this time it was a guy in the suit, who walked over a large forest models and for some scenes, they used a large hands and feet, which was a good usage for that time, (they also did that in original, but here felt much more better) and they also edited Kong's face on a large screen for most close-up scenes between lady and the ape. The ending brought as again in New York, where they planned to use Kong as a oil company mascot, but he didn't liked... and guess what... OK, I am not gonna spoil anything here, but you know what happens on the end. Overall, nice filming location, nice visuals, nice cinematography and nice score from John Barry. Enjoy this film.

83,talisencrw,"The runt of the litter, though still quite watchable",7,15 January 2016,"I had first seen the outstanding original of 'King Kong', still transcendent and captivating in its then-prescient use of special effects wizardry, then Sir Peter Jackson's recent remake, which was still extremely impressive. I had only heard horrible things about the 70's version, but I have come to admire Guillermin's films that I had watched, and look at that cast, so when I found the blu used, for a good price, I took a chance. It's definitely the runt of the litter, but is by no means a disaster. It's intriguing that they had originally wanted Joseph Sargent to direct with Peter Falk starring, and that Meryl Streep was considered for the role that eventually went to Jessica Lange. The changes they made to update Kong for the seventies were intriguing (as they wanted the script to be completely different from the Cooper/Schoedsack masterpiece), and I'm left curious, had Sir Peter Jackson chosen to make Kong a 21st-century schizoid apeman instead of doing a period piece, how that would have transpired. Even being Canadian, seeing the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center made me wistfully nostalgic. The only part of the film that was excruciating to watch was when Kong is made to perform for the American Bicentennial festivities, and at the ending, I was curious how Lange got down from the rooftop of one of the towers so fast. The answer probably lies on the cutting room floor, and the editing was probably rushed for release date, so no one must have noticed...",King Kong
84,rparham,Bad Kong! Bad Kong!,5,13 February 2006,"In the 1970's both film uber-producer Dino De Laurentis and Universal Studios were competing to bring a remake of the 1933 RKO classic King Kong to the screen. De Laurentis made his opus and Universal eventually scrapped their plans to produce theirs. It would have been interesting to see what Universal would have cooked up, because it couldn't be any worse than De Laurentis' mangy dog of a remake. The 1976 version of King Kong is a key example of why film buffs bemoan the announcement of any remake of a classic, simply because they don't want it to turn out like this.Admittedly, there are supporters of this version of King Kong, including online movie critic James Berardinelli, but I am not really sure what they see in this film. It is not a complete waste of celluloid, but it's negative aspects, to me, far outweigh it's positive ones. Updated to modern times, King Kong opens in Surabaya, Indonesia, where Petrox Petroleum executive Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin) is launching an expedition into the Pacific to locate a strange island detected by satellites. Wilson believes that the island is a huge cache of oil (This film was produced during the height of the energy crisis of the '70s), and plans to mine it for all it's worth. Stowing away on the ship is Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) a professor of simian biology who believes that something incredible is located on that island, and it's not oil. En route to the island, the ship picks up a sole survivor of a yacht that capsized during a major storm, Dwan (Jessica Lange, in her first movie role), who falls for Jack on the trip. Arriving at the island, Wilson discovers it is inhabited by a native people who kidnap Dwan and offer her up to their god: a twenty-five foot tall ape dubbed Kong. Prescott leads a group to save her, while Wilson determines to salvage his trip by hatching a plan to capture Kong and use him as a mascot for the Petrox corporation.This version of King Kong does exactly three things right: it updates the motivation to go to the island appropriately for the time, it gives a more significant amount of development to Kong and Dwan's relationship and it has a great score by composer John Barry. Most everything else in this Kong is a miss. First and foremost, unlike the original film, where Kong was brought to life by the magic of stop-motion animation, here, we are treated to a man in an ape suit running around miniature sets. A man in a bad ape suit, running around bad miniature sets. Almost all of the film's verisimilitude is tossed out the window when Kong appears on screen. The ape suit is so poor, and the obvious miniature sets he inhabits are so lame as to be laughable. This was the state of big budget film-making in the mid-70's? Yes, I am aware this was 1976, not 2006, but that was one year before audiences were dazzled by Star Wars, and that has held up to the test of time. King Kong pales by comparison.On the acting front, Jeff Bridges is competent and delivers a decent performance. Jessica Lange is also okay, but she is so hamstrung by her ditzy character that she becomes annoying at times. But the prize here goes to Charles Grodin, who overacts and chews the scenery so mightly, you wonder if there were any sets left to shoot on. You can occasionally forgive an actor who goes over the top, but Grodin is way, way over the top, and he quickly renders his character buffoonish and ridiculous. King Kong is not supposed to be a realistic movie, but Grodin makes his character such a caricature that we can't believe in him for a moment.I must give credit where credit is due: screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. does give some depth to the scenes between Kong and Dwan (by the way, a character named Dwan? What was he thinking?). She begins afraid of him and then manages to form a bond and, in Dwan's case, a feeling of empathy for the great beast. This aspect of the film works, and is it's lone screen writing bright spot. The romance between Dwan and Jack is dead on arrival, we don't feel much for these two, and his environmental message is a bit heavy-handed.By the time this sad affair draws to a merciful close, millions of viewers are witness to the slaughter of an American classic at the hands of filmmakers who seemed to be interested in merely making a buck and not honoring an iconic film in Hollywood history. And people wonder why remakes are usually considered the work of Mephistopheles.",King Kong
85,Marlburian,entertaining hokum,5,22 December 2005,"Many reviews revile this remake, one criticising the fact that it was obviously a man inside the gorilla suit. Well, I guess it's not too easy to get a gorilla to act the range of emotions demonstrated by this Kong, and in 1976 special-effects technology wasn't advanced enough to do so instead. As it happens, the gorilla's facial emotions (albeit mechanically-arranged) are more accomplished than those of some of the human characters, not least the expedition boss played by Charles Grodin.It's hokum, of course, but entertainingly so. The problem is that for the middle part of the film Kong is portrayed as a sexual threat. He even pulls down the front of Jessia Lange's sacrificial outfit, and one white man speculates that she might have been raped. Though Kong's mid-region is tactfully nebulous, this would have been physically impossible - like a human having sex with a hamster. For the sexual subtext to have convinced, Kong would have needed to be little larger than your average gorilla, hence nullifying his value as a captive trophy and making it impossible for him to cause so much mayhem in New York.Lange herself is certainly an eye-catcher, and it is interesting to see that her make-up survived her shipwreck. (One might also note that she remains remarkably unscathed after being clutched in Kong's paw as he clambers around his island and up the World Trade Centre.) When seen in 2005 the film struck some resonance: the ""attack"" on the World Trade Centre, the reference to a fuel crisis, and the unsympathetic portrayal of an oil company eager to exploit an oil find with scant regard for the local population. For these reasons this version may earn itself a short paragraph in any study of how the cinema has reflected recent history.Most films of this type - such as The Lost World and The Land that Time Forgot - also fall in the hokum category, and among them King Kong compares well enough. There's some impressive scenery and only one glaringly-evident ""outdoor"" scene obviously filmed in a studio, when a rescue party tries to cross a ravine.But no aspect of the film places it in the Oscar category.",King Kong
86,vampi1960,Big budget b-movie,5,12 July 2006,"King Kong the first remake does'nt fill the original Kong's shoes.its full of mistakes and blunders,the plot is different from the original. it was filmed during the great gas crisis.so an oil excecitive played by Charles grodin,in a hammy performance takes a crew to an uncharted island(not known by Exxon)to find oil,a bearded Jeff bridges stows away on the ship,they pick up a lone survivor of a shipwreck,sexy Jessica Lange.after that its all predictable adventures.they find Kong,make up whiz rick baker in a gorilla suit he built,no dinosaurs but a very rubbery fake giant snake,that Kong fights.its a cornball movie,bad but enjoyable.there is a 40 foot Kong they used in one scene that lasts about 3 minutes,and thats where most of the budget went.this is a Dino De laurentis film following his other disaster;orca the killer whale. the special(?)effects with Kong on the world trade center is very Godzilla like.the original and latest remake are far better then this one.not without merit,but when first released there was a lot of hype.

87,bbhlthph,This 1976 version provides a morality play for the ethics and ecology movements.,8,22 April 2008,"A trilogy of films titled King Kong span the history of sound film making. The first, released in 1933 just after the introduction of talkies set new standards for both monster films and dramatic special effects sequences - so much so that it has become an unquestioned classic which still sells well on DVD and is listed as 'essential viewing' for most College film courses. All three films tell essentially the same story, but by Peter Jackson's 2005 version its duration had doubled from 100 min. to 200 min. What makes this trilogy so unique is the 30 year intervals between the successive films, which means all three use completely different technologies for creating their special effects, even though the stories presented vary very little. A comment elsewhere on this database notes another very significant feature they share. Apparently, when correction is made for the changing value of the dollar, all three had roughly comparable budgets and all three achieved comparable modest commercial success - this seems to point to the fact that the quality of the film was not a major factor in its appeal to prospective viewers, each film was supported by a similar proportion of the movie going audience presumably electing to see it primarily on the basis of its story. Such similarities make it particularly difficult to discuss any of these films in isolation, but I felt the 1976 film was on balance the most satisfactory to watch - the exact converse of the assessment made by most critics and other IMDb database users. I am prejudiced against remakes of well respected classic films, particularly where the remake 'pirates' the story of the original too closely, and will therefore attempt to explain this preference.Great film-making earned the original version its place as an essential film for students - I can re-watch it repeatedly, but only to admire and enjoy the craftsmanship with which it was created, not its story. All three films share this by now famous story about an isolated tribe of savages who periodically sacrifice one of their young maidens, tied to some fancy timber altar and offered to a gigantic mountain gorilla like creature they worship. They capture a white girl from a ship for the same purpose. The monster takes a fancy to this new offering, grasping her in its hand and protecting her fiercely. Eventually the ship's crew rescue her and capture the monster which is taken back to New York for public exhibition - it escapes and climbs a skyscraper on top of which it is killed by gunfire from aeroplanes. This choice of monster - not a mutation, alien or some primeval slime but a gorilla - provides a firm and welcome link with reality. Gorillas are the most totally vegetarian large primate - they are also unusually gentle and even lovable creatures (Watch ""Gorillas in The Mist""). The story as written by Cooper in 1933 may have been inspired by a powerful but very brief sequence in Demille's 1932 ""The Sign of the Cross"" which showed a Christian girl tied to a stake in the Roman Arena in a very similar way waiting to be ravaged by a silverback gorilla. But there is no way in which a 30 foot monster could attempt to sexually ravage a normal size girl so Cooper's film abandoned everything known about the natural history of gorillas by implying that the native maidens offered to the monster were all killed. It even featured an introductory prophecy to the effect that the moment the monster shows pity and fails to kill its victim it becomes doomed itself. Later, at the point where the viewer is left wondering where such an oversize monster could have come from, whether Skull Island could support a breeding population and how many like King Kong could exist, other greater travesties of acceptability follow. Long extinct creatures from the dinosaur era appear, leading to dramatic battles in which King Kong defends his new toy from tyrannosaurus like creatures extinct long before any mammals larger than a rodent had evolved. Presented in this way, it is hard to recognise the filmscript as that of a classic work, however brilliant the visual sequences created. The film's ultimate success is largely due to its final sequences featuring the death of King Kong on the Empire State building in New York. These emphasise his near human qualities and engender the sympathy that he could never command as King of the Jungle.My preference for the 1976 film arises partly because the ship here is exploring for oil, not carrying a filming expedition. This expands the story to become a parable extolling the significance of understanding and affection over empty corporate greed measuring everything only by its dollar value. Made in colour (almost essential for many modern filmgoers), it very wisely eliminates the totally incompatible Mesozoic sequences featuring dinosaurs - the only hint of other forms of savage life on Skull island comes when a snake similar in appearance to an Anaconda attacks Kong's new toy and arouses his ire. Most important, the monkey suit worn by Rick Baker when playing King Kong had lenses in the eye sockets through which his own eyes were seen. The King's soulful eyes give the impression of being able to look into his mind as he faces his various achievements and failures - a film-makers triumph which for me raises this film above either of the alternatives. Admittedly Peter Jackson's 2005 film features CGI sequences with visual appeal dwarfing anything in the two earlier films. Unfortunately in the process the coherent story is lost, largely because its duration becomes twice what can be supported. It resembles a child's scrapbook, full of colourful and dramatic but unrelated imagery that provides little to take away with one after viewing.",King Kong
88,dussaultjulien,Wow. Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,11 August 2019,"I'm going to have to say it. King Kong versus Godzilla had not only a better story, but better dialogue, and I'm not talking about the original Japanese dub I'm talking about the International dub, which is pretty amazing considering that this movie is so hyped in these IMDb reviews.This is Jessica Lange's debut feature film, and it really shows that she is a flowering actress. She is absolutely horrible and unbelievable, as well as the entire cast. King Kong escapes is more believable than this movie oh, heck even son of Kong is more believable than this movie. I'm a big fan of crappy movies oh, but there's only so much a person can take before they have to turn off the TV and take out the disc.If you want to watch a better version of this movie go ahead and watch the 2004 Peter Jackson version of it, because at least Jackson knew what he was doing whereas this director must have been working on two projects at once, because this movie is all over the place.

89,sveknu,Awful remake,1,15 February 2007,"The original King Kong from 1933 isn't exactly my favorite movie (nor my favorite monster movie) but I found it OK. You can't say the same about this total stinker. They made some changes, most of them to the worse. Initially, I like it when they change certain things for the remake because it normally makes it more watchable for those who have seen the original. Sadly, they decided to have almost no fighting between King Kong and other monsters on the island this time. That was some of the best parts in the original, and because of that I got disappointed. Another change is that they used the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. I liked that change, but the whole thing was badly executed by the movie makers. The special effects were rather bad, and worst of all, the story is absolutely rubbish. The reason for that is because they had to drag some environmentalist crap into it, and that made the whole movie very irritating and stupid. Jeff Bridges made a good effort in destroying this movie with his hippie-style.",King Kong
90,MF210,Sometimes entertaining but too damn tedious to full enjoy,6,30 December 2005,"Rating: ** out of ****.I thought I would redo my comments on this film since I recently watched it on TV recently. First of all, I can honestly admit that I have never been a fan of this film, even when I saw it when I was younger I never really cared for it. The problem is that this film is just too long and really just too stupid to really enjoy. That is not to say there isn't anything worth praising here but the negative significantly outweigh the positive.First of all, I'll start with the film's good points. I like how they made Jessica Lange's character actually care about Kong instead of being disgusted by him. Honestly, I have never seen the original film (yet at least) but I heard the situation was just the opposite, Fay Wray's character hated Kong. So I will at least say that at the end when Kong dies, I did at least feel some sadness for him. Its interesting to note that in Peter Jackson's film he used this approach for the relationship between the Ape and the women, instead of the one in the original film. It's developed much more in Jackson's film than here but its always been one of the most interesting aspects of this film.Then there's Kong himself. In this film, he's brought to life by make-up artist Rick Baker in a monkey suit. For the most part, I think it works pretty well. He doesn't look 100 percent convincing, since you can tell that those are not the eyes of a giant ape. Plus, there are times when Kong looks at Dwan (Jessica Langes character) and you can't help but feel thats the facial expression of a horny teenager instead of a big ape. However, I think Kong still holds up reasonably well.What doesn't look convincing in the slightest is that big snake that Kong fights. How, even in 1976, would that look convincing? It looks so fake its funny and Kong actually struggles to beat it. Seriously, it is one of the most embarrassing effects I have ever seen in a film.The acting does not really help matters either. The best of the bunch is Jeff Bridges, who actually does quite well here. The rest of the cast doesn't fair so well. Charles Grodin is embarrassingly over the top and its safe to say Jessica Lange had a less than stellar debut.To be fair, there are moments near the end of the film when she is good,when she tells Kong not to put her down or he'll be killed.The script does not help either. It contains some of the most ridiculous lines I have ever heard in a film like when Dwan asks Kong, ""Im a Libra, what sign are you."" Then there's when she calls Kong a ""Goddamn chauvinist pig ape."" I guess you can't entirely blame Jessica Lange for the awfulness of her performances when she is given the worst lines of all the actors. What made the relationship in the new film special is that there were very few said at all, it was mostly all non-verbal. You could see the feelings in the facial expressions of the ape and the women.That said, this film still has some impressive cinematography. The scene with the fog around the island lends an eerie atmosphere. Plus, the score by John Barry is top notch. Finally, Kongs first appearance is nicely handled. But when it comes down to it, the film is just too damn dumb to take for 134 minutes. There are some good things about this King Kong but Jackson's remake makes this one look insignificant by comparison. So the film can be occasionally fun to watch but it ends up being too much.",King Kong
91,jmillerdp,Hilariously Awful!,6,6 July 2013,"Oh, this was bad. So bad! After seeing it in the theater, I was truly amazed at what a disaster it was. Dino de Laurentiis does know how to promote a movie! The posters were great, for instance.But, the movie is a mess! The main problem? The inexplicable use of effects legend Rick Baker in an ape costume. Why, oh why! Yeah, I know this was before CGI and everything. But, there have always been good stop-motion animators, including the very legendary Ray Harryhausen. Was he not available or something? So, they have Baker in a costume. The costume is good (by Rick Baker himself, of course!). But, they shoot it in standard frame rate (24 frames = 1 second, shot and projected). This is instead of shooting it in slow motion, at least a little slow motion. Just to give Kong some feeling of his being 40 feet tall. But, they don't, and so almost the whole Kong footage comes across as giving us Rick Baker in an ape suit!The rest of the ""effects,"" such as they are, lack a lot too. The giant snake comes across as incredibly cheap and fake.The rest of it is mediocre at best! The acting is okay, but Charles Grodin in particular is awfully hammy. Sheesh! Richard Kline's cinematography is good, while John Barry's film score is kind of sleepy.And, lastly, there is zero reason for this remake! That includes Peter Jackson's ill-advised remake, that was okay, but again very unnecessary. I know that people want to ""update"" the effects, but the effects do not need to be updated!

92,a.lampert,Epic that need to be reassessed,7,10 April 2017,"King Kong 1976 is a film I've always avoided up until now due to some bad reports about it since it first came out. It came up on TV recently and I watched it tonight and it really was the most pleasant surprise of a put-down movie I've seen since Waterworld, which I enjoyed equally. Two movies then that are very misjudged. King Kong not only looks great, it looks big in every way, not just the gorilla, but the sets, the scope, the stunning scenery, big in every way. Jessica Lange in her first picture is amazingly good (in fact I just read she won the Golden Globe for best newcomer) and Jeff Bridges is his usual reliable hero, so two strong leads here. I did spot John Agar right at the end who I haven't seen since his 40's heyday so that was a surprise. I know the picture is now 41 years old but it just looked terrific to me so seven stars from me. I love the original and also the Naomi Watt's more recent one but this stands up extremely well against the others which I really didn't expect. Highly recommended if you, like me, have been avoiding it.",King Kong
93,vtcavuoto,Good remake of the original,7,2 January 2007,"Out of all three King Kong movies, I always held an appreciation for this one. I remember the shot where Kong comes out of the jungle,trees hiding his face so you can't get a good look until he towers over Jessica Lange! That is one of the things that builds suspense in the film. There are some limitations when compared to Peter Jackson's epic but also there are improvements over the original. The costume won an Oscar for Rick Baker, who designed it. I liked the story and there was plenty of action. The acting isn't on the same level as it's predecessor and some of the the scenes are corny(especially the ones with the giant robotic Kong-it doesn't move realistically). The direction and cinematography are well done and the pace moves right along. A good Kong film that is worth seeing.",King Kong
94,jwpeel-1,There IS only One King Kong - it was made in 1933,1,28 November 2005,"I'm going to make this review short. I despise this picture. The only good memory I have of this turkey about a gorilla is that I have friends who were struggling comedians who made it as extras in the crowd scene at the end. I had almost no money when I lived in New York when this one came out and I used my rare three dollars to come in out of the cold LITERALLY ans I could sleep on the sleazy 42nd Street Theater.Besides the truly rotten performance by Charles Brodin as Carl Denham, and waste of both Jeff Bridges and Jessic Lange who all but apologized for this film that all but destroyed her career.(Fortunately, it did not) the damn poster is terrible. Think about this for a moment. Here is Kong almost taller than the twin towers he stands astride holding a jet plane which is as large as the woman he carries in his other hand. This would make Jessic Lange about the size of the 50 foot woman from another awful movie. And there was no jet plane, if you remember this picture at all.One more closing note. For the record, when people talk about gorillas or orangutangs as ""monkeys,"" tell them to get smart. Monkeys have tails. Apes do not. Kong, all the chimps you've seen in movies and TV shows, and the orangutangs in those Clint Eastwood pics are Apes.

I kept waiting for it to turn bad and it does slightly in the last 15 minutes but up to then it had been a highly entertaining engrossing action movie. Jessica Lange in her debut performance was pretty good only faltering a little at the end. I thought the monkey effects were a lot more impressive (and expressive) than I was expecting and totally acceptable for a 1976 made film. Maybe we've been a little spoilt seeing so many computer generated effects films in the last 20 years. Having John Barry compose the score is always a good way to make a film seem special and here he delivers another memorable score that certainly adds to the pleasure of watching the film.

I liked more the Kong of this film than of the 2005 version because I found it more real than the Kong created by computer. Another point in favor of this movie is that it lasts just 134 minutes instead of the 187 minutes of the 2005 which I found very long and sometimes boring. I know that this version sometimes looks so naive but I think that this is one of its strength too because this movie just looks being entertaining nothing else. Ah and the most important thing is that we can watch the beautiful legs of the hot Jessica Lange (she looks great in those shorts jeans, thanks god ;)).The plot is about a group of men who go to an island looking for oil with Jack Prescott (an adventurous anthropologist who is looking for a very big beast) and Dwan (a beautiful and silly starlet) who weren't part of this crew at the beginning.

98,unakaczynski,The Template for Improper Remakes,5,30 December 2005,"King Kong Adventure/Giant Monster Horror Here we have the classic story of the money-hungry oil company setting course over the ocean to find desolate Skull Island to drill for oil. What's that you say? That doesn't sound like the classic you know? Well too bad for you, because 1976 Hollywood doesn't give a sh*t what you have to say! They're coked up and ready to give a true classic a modern raping!Well, basically, it's the classic King Kong story, except instead of a film crew, it's, like I said, an oil company. Way to pander to the oil crisis of the 70's, Hollywood. Jessica Lange now plays the part that made Fay Wray famous, with less brains but more sexiness. Sure, she looks pretty hot, but is as shallow as a kiddie pool. Charles Grodin is the evil mastermind of the oil expedition who then changes cue to go catch a Kong and bring him back as-here we go-king sh*t of corporate mascots. The worst creature they came up with for this island for Kong to fight against is a lame giant snake-with lots of teeth. They could've at least had Kong fighting the Sinclair dinosaurHere's the breakdown:The Good:--Occasionally, the special effects aren't too bad. But generally, they're not overly interesting.--Decent acting from everyone except Lange.--Decent use of incorporating the whole oil theme into the story, but Christ, dealing oil tycoons in King Kong? This feels pretty stupid.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The effects work on Kong is decent, but not perfect by any means.--Jessica Lange is hot.--Kong is now equal to Godzilla in that it's a dude stomping around a miniature city in a costume. Sometimes it looks just like that, sometimes it looks better than that.--Kong is good and violent.--Average Cinematography and Atmosphere.--Kong climbs the recently completed (at the time) World Trade Center buildings instead of the Empire State Building. You remember those? Some jerks tried to land passenger jets on them and failed miserably.The Bad:--Extremely shallow compared to Kong '33 and Kong '05.--NO dinosaurs!--Very little heart. Lange's character (still managing to play an actress) is dimwitted and she doesn't feel for Kong very well. Kong's emotional display is also pretty iffy. He's one stiff monkey.--Kong spends all his time, just like real gorillas, walking upright. Oh wait a second That's how people walk! Apes go on all fours! Silly me.--Kong doesn't sound very much like an ape.--Pretty awful sets and backgrounds. Very dullespecially the ""lush tropical, primitive island."" --There's a part where Kong hold Lange under a waterfall to wash her, then proceeds to blow on her to dry her off. And holy crap, does he ever look ridiculous. Has anyone ever seen an ape puff it's cheeks and blow on anything? I know I haven't. I've seen 'em bear their gums and teeth and lick their own snotty nostrils, but never blow air.The Ugly:--This is the likely source of the term ""bastardization."" Memorable Scene:--I guess when Kong breaks loose in New York. Either that or when he pretty much removes Jessica Lange's top while molesting her. Or, I mean, ""touching her to learn about her.""Acting: 7/10 Story: 3/10 (total raping of a classic) Atmosphere: 5/10 Cinematography: 5/10 Character Development: 5/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 6/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 (There's no nudity, but sex is a primary theme of this one) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (no gore) Dialogue: 5/10 Music: 5/10 Direction: 6/10 Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 2/10Overall: 5/10There you have it. This is one inferior remake. It's interesting and it has a few high points, but it does pretty much everything either worse or wrong than the true blue original King Kong from 1933.

99,boscofl,"""Well, here's to the big one""",7,9 June 2021,"One of the more maligned remakes in cinema history has to be Dino De Laurentiis 1976 version of King Kong. It has emerged as a camp classic containing a mixed bag of thrills, unintended laughs, and some impressive (for the time) special effects. Every penny of the budget is on film although the producers clearly went to the bargain bin when shopping for leading actors; one would suppose the logic was King Kong sells himself. In the end that's all most people will watch this movie for.While technically a remake this version crafts a fresh premise with new characters while hitting the iconic set pieces of the original. Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin) of the Petrox company believes a perpetual cloud bank in the South Pacific conceals an island rich in oil deposits. He and his crew set out for this mysterious area with stowaway primate paleontologist Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges) and encounter a stray dinghy containing Dwan (Jessica Lange) along the way. Once they reach their destination the plot progresses similarly to the original movie this film is aping.In terms of cinematic value King Kong is all over the place. The mechanizations that get the cast to the island is fresh, timely for 1976, and cleverly done. Corporate greed plays a big role and the thrust towards conservation makes Kong a more sympathetic character within the film than he had been previously. The script clearly isn't taking the giant ape concept too seriously with kitschy dialogue and broad performances. There are many uncomfortable references to rape and a horny gorilla that seem unnecessary with Kong's smiling countenance ratcheting up the creep factor. Some of this is neutralized by the stunning location work, a beautiful score by John Barry, and very convincing miniature work.The presentation of the title character is particularly well done considering the technology of the time. The ape suit is convincing; Kong is especially frightening early on and the scenes of him rampaging, specifically the assault on the island wall and the elevated train sequence, are outstanding. He moves convincingly and boasts a wide range of facial expressions. Unfortunately a pair of combat set pieces are disappointingly rendered: the battle with the giant snake and the final assault atop the Twin Towers. The reptile looks laughably phony while the World Trade Center sequence consists of too many shots of Kong yelling in front of a blue screen with helicopters matted in. Plus he would have been shredded had he truly been impacted by the number of bullets he was supposed to have been hit with. Clearly the filmmakers were limited by the current state of special effects but the rendering of this moment in the original version, with even more limited technology, was handled better.There are only 3 characters who have the opportunity to make much of an impression: Jack, Wilson, and Dwan. Jeff Bridges gives a fine account of himself as the guy who is smarter than everyone else, wiser than everyone else, and promotes the film's pro wildlife stance. He also has the best hair in the picture. Charles Grodin is staggeringly over-the-top as corporate guy Wilson and adds much to the cheese factor. He's wrong about everything throughout the entire movie and emerges as a real schmuck. The character is basically a cartoon and a foil for Jack; how Wilson could ever have risen to a position of such prominence being the complete moron he's continuously shown to be is a point best not pondered. Jessica Lange come close to matching him in the camp department: she spends 60% of the film appearing to be high, 30% acting like she's trying to give herself an orgasm, and 10% demonstrating serious acting potential that she would eventually fulfill. To be fair she had an impossible task embodying the character as written (a bimbo) but it's a laughable performance nonetheless.I confess to having a soft spot for this film; at the tender age of 8 my parents brought me to see the original theatrical release after I fell in love with the 1933 original. I distinctly remember cringing when Kong broke open the rubber snake, hid my eyes when he was riddled with bullets, and having nightmares after going to bed that night. On the plus side I developed an immediate crush on Jessica Lange which lasted for years. For these reasons I view this production through a very nostalgic lens. This King Kong is still an entertaining picture despite its flaws and is best enjoyed when checking modern sensibilities at the door. A glass of wine to go with all the cinematic cheese wouldn't hurt, either.",King Kong
100,jcaraway3,A King sized dud,2,15 March 2010,"This has got to be one of the worst remakes, if not worst films, of all time. Everything about this film is utterly repulsive and 70's except for some decent cinematography. The other two King Kong films are filled with action, danger, and adventure. What do we have here? Rick Baker in an ape suit carrying a shrieking Jessica Lange around for over an hour and a half until they get to New York City...where Rick Baker in an ape suit carries a shrieking Jessica Lange around the World Trade Center. The characters were all stupid and unlikeable: The shrieking Jessica Lange, the holier-than-thou environmentalist Jeff Bridges, and the oily oil man Charles Grodin..actually turns out to be more likable than our heroes. All I can say is this: At 134 minutes, this is a great movie to fall asleep to. Don't worry, you probably won't miss anything.",King Kong
101,Ralpho,One of the great movies of my youth,7,3 August 2002,"""King Kong"" was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It was the big 'event' movie of 1976 and showed on two screens in most multiplexes. It might have been the first movie to get that treatment. With a production cost of $24 million it was the most expensive movie ever made at that time.Promotional material offered for sale dwarfed anything that had been done in that area before. A fast-food joint offered King Kong collectible glasses (I still have a set). And you could find posters, T-shirts and a 'Making Of King Kong' book.I very much enjoyed 'King Kong' as a 17-year-old high school senior, but not so much later as an adult. The romance between Dwan and Jack seemed contrived once I got older. Other aspects of the film struck me as just dumb. Like the ship's radar being able to pick up Kong when he was walking around the island. Or the SUNNY aerial shot of the people walking on the allegedly fog-shrouded island. Or Jack's theory that the fog was produced not by a huge supply of crude oil near the surface, but by 'animal respiration.' As if King Kong's breathing caused the fog bank. Give me a break!Yet there's something about movies one enjoyed as a youth that makes them special for the rest of one's life, no matter how bad they really are.But 'King Kong' had it's good points, too. First of all, it was funny. Charles Grodin's portrayal of the greedy, desperate oil company executive is scenery-chewing at its best. For years after, I watched in vain for Grodin to play a similar character, but everything else he has done is nothing like his work in 'King Kong.' (Nothing as good either, I might add.)Speaking of singular performances, you won't recognize René Auberjonois if your frame of reference is his work on 'Benson' and 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.' The voice he uses in 'King Kong' is nothing like the gravely voice we're used to hearing.Jeff Bridges is perfect in the role of Jack Prescott. His long hair is a nice touch, although it probably turned off some of the older people in the theater. Jeff has a way with a sarcastic line that few actors can equal.Jessica Lange comes off worse than any other actor in the film. Not because of her performance, which is fine, but because her character is an airhead who is only there to be protected (and rescued when that doesn't work) from Kong. The fact that her costumes were chosen for their ability to showcase her body and that her breasts are briefly visible when Kong undresses her has got to make the actress cringe nowadays when she thinks about this movie.I'll close by noting that John Barry's score of 'King Kong' was terrific. Twenty-six years after the movie debuted and I can still remember the title tune.",King Kong
102,jrs-8,Guilty Pleasure,7,11 August 2004,"I hate to admit this having read many of the reviews but I can't help but enjoy ""King Kong"". Yes I realize it is silly and yest I realize the special effects aren't.... well, special. But I was 11 years old when this came out at Christmas in 1976. The hype was huge. The posters screamed that it was ""The Motion Picutre Event of Our Time"". I was caught up in it all and the film has a lot of fond memories for me.On the positive side I think John Barry's score is one of his best. The lack of an Oscar nomination was a crime. Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin (playing a bad guy for a change) are acceptable in their roles. Jessica Lange didn't exactly hint there was a two time Oscar winner present but she looked awfully good. And the supporting cast featuring character actors (Ed Lauter, John Randolph, etc) we've seen over and over again.It's no classic. It may not even be that good. But every time it's on I watch it and enjoy it despite its flaws. I guess that's what a guilty pleasure is all about. And this may be my guiltiest pleasure.",King Kong
103,elliott78212,No Bimbo for Kong,7,7 February 2013,"Time and Reflection, while this movie wasn't the mega blockbuster hit they had hoped when it came out in 1977 it by no means was a total flop. The Critics slaughtered Jessica Lange's performance, recently I watched this movie again online and found her performance genuine to the times, and even a more sophisticated, optimistic characterization that embodied an aspiring actress looking for fame. By contrast to the performance Naomi Watts gives in the total remake of the original Kong (lets note this Kong was not a total remake but an update of the original to the 1970's), Watt's plays a down trodden yet confident actress looking for a big break, while Lange plays a modern woman who wants is starved for fame and uses her sex appeal and smarts with a sense of wonder and innocence mixed in its a little Marilyn Monroe at times, watching her now it all seems appropriate. The movie itself has many great moments the writer was really trying to accomplish something did her fully realize it not always some of it may have ended up on the cutting room floor or was re-written on the fly as is often the case with any film. I do believe this to be a modern filmmaking achievement and can be considered a modern day classic despite some of its dated special FX it was State of the Art at the time of its release including the use of the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. If you've never seen this movie or its been a long time since you last saw it I recommend a viewing.",King Kong
104,cwrdlylyn,KING KONG : The Weakest Version Still Has Enough Heart To Carry It Through...,8,26 September 2006,"KING KONG (1976) When I first saw this film in the late 80's, I was in awe of how real the giant beast appeared. Gone was the obvious claymation and now what appeared before me was an ape that could actually move and interact with living actors. At the time, I was 9 years old. Now I am 23, and for various reasons I have come to realize that the 1976 version of KING KONG is clearly the weakest of the three adaptations. However, it does bring a level of heart and feeling to the story that was missed in the original version.The original KING KONG portrayed the giant ape as little more then a dangerous beast. After capturing his beauty Ann Darrow, little was done to humanize the monster. This time around, the character of Kong becomes a living, breathing creature with feelings (both sexual and friendly). Aside from giving the ape more subtext, the 1976 changes the time period and original mission of the crew. Instead of setting off to shoot a movie, the original objective of Fred Walker (played by Charles Grodin) is to set off for a remote island that will prove to be the best oil reserve in the world. Also on board the ship is Jack Prescott (played by Jeff Bridges), an environmental missionary out to explore the new world and see if rumors he's heard of a fantastic creature on the island are true. While headed toward the island, the crew picks up Dwan (Jessica Lange in her film debut), the only survivor from a massive shipwreck. Aside from these changes, the story is very familiar. They arrive on the island, meet the unfriendly natives, Dwan gets captured by Kong, and everyone sets off to rescue her.Unfortunately, everything that impressed me so much when I was 9 is now dated and far from awe-inspiring... and the advancement of technology exposes certain flaws in the 1976 De Laurentis version that might not have been so apparent in the past. The film seems to have wasted so much money on their trick shots and special effects that they forgot to infuse everything with a visual style. While the 1933 original's special effects are no longer cutting edge, the film as a whole embraces the special effects and stylizes them in a way so that they never feel dated. KING KONG ('76) simply displays the special effects without the slightest artistic integrity. This is special effects showboating w/o artistic infusion... and as a result the film can't escape the ""dated"" label.However, on the flip side, now that the films special effects are less distracting, it's easier to see some of the more subtle qualities in this version. The original KING KONG was happy to only tell the first half of it's ""Beauty & The Beast"" tale, the half in which Beauty never stops fearing the Beast. The 1976 version goes on to tell the full emotional tale of ""Beauty & The Beast"". For the first time we see a genuine bond and appreciation between Dwan and Kong. Slowly Dwan realizes how pure Kong's heart is, and she sees him as a well-intentioned victim once he's shipped over to New York for all to make money off of.Also, despite a high camp factor, the film manages to have its moments. For example, the sacrifice scene in which Dwan is hypnotized by the gyrations of the natives is arguably the most interesting of the three versions. Other scenes that really help to strengthen the emotional bond between Kong and Dwan take place on the journey home to New York. While both the original version and the 2005 remake decided to jump straight from Skull Island back to New York, this film examines the changes that take place in its leading characters during this transitional time.It's impossible for me to see the 70's KING KONG as anything more then the weakest of three interesting films. But the story of KING KONG is one that has fascinated me every time. Just like with the original and the newest version, I can watch this film over and over, year after year. What I can especially appreciate in this version is it's emphasis on compassion and creating a bond between man and ape. Unfortunately, in it's efforts to do so it loses some of the excitement and adrenaline that the original had. Thankfully, we have the 2005 version to perfectly blend the best qualities of the previous versions into one thrilling masterpiece! ... B- ...",King Kong
105,pninson,Tough to sit through,3,14 December 2005,"Riddled with cheesy, hokey special effects, a lumbering overlong plot, campy dialogue and cardboard characters, this misfire has little to recommend it. There are a few good moments but nothing to shout about. It goes on forever and I found it frequently boring.And it's never scary; it completely lacks intensity.And it takes 30 minutes to even get to the island.Jeff Bridges looks like he's doing a preview of ""The Big Lebowski"".Jessica Lange looks pretty but is required by the script to act like an idiot (most of the time).Rene Auberjenois emerges from his small role with a few tattered shreds of dignity.Charles Grodin seems to be trying to impersonate comedian Paul Lynde.No wonder I've never heard of this director.",King Kong

No such luck here. The special effects range from decent-(Kong's rampage in New York) to downright ludicrous (blowdrying Jessica Lange after pulling her out of the water.)In the original KONG it was clear that the staff put their whole heart and soul into it and produced a classic. Not so here. It looked like DeLaurentis & Co. were just out to make a quick buck-just like Devlin & Emmerich with their disasterous GODZILLA remake 22 years later.One piece of possible good news though. Rumor has it that a remake of the classic KONG-one that is faithful to the original-is in the works.If those involved in this project happen to read this review-PLEASE!!!!!GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME!Rating:  *1/2 out of *****",King Kong
107,kira02bit,Why?,1,8 February 2015,"A group of oil workers stumble upon a giant ape and return him to New York with expected catastrophic results.The original King Kong is a classic for a very good reason. Even with the advances in special effects, the entire production still holds up very well to this day. It is a film with a lot of imagination and suspense and delves into our fear of the unknown on Skull Island. However, the advances in special effects are a good reason why it is a candidate for remake status. The problem here is that producer Dino De Laurentiis (affectionately known in the industry as Dino De Horrendous) and director John Guillermin and company do not seem to understand the themes that made the first film a classic.For anyone who wants to pick at Peter Jackson's 2005 remake, there is no question that Jackson gets what made the original film an enduring thrill ride and largely re-recaptured that spirit. The original features many memorable suspense scenes in the murky depths of Skull Island with a variety of prehistoric and primordial creatures taking center stage. This woebegone remake features pretty much nothing but an obviously phony man in a monkey suit making goo-goo eyes at a pouty blond (Jessica Lange before she could act). I remember seeing this film as a kid - filmgoers had a lot of expectations going in and were looking forward to the event. Not only did this not connect with me, but I remember vividly the wild raucous laughter and jeers which greeted the film. The critics savaged the film deservedly and it became a huge box office bomb. To my surprise, there has developed a certain faction that actually hold the film in some regard. Having watched it twice more since my initial exposure, I am supremely puzzled as to why that could be since the film gets progressively worse with each successive viewing.The special effects are pretty dreadful and do not improve on the original, which is saying something since there is a 40+ year difference in their production dates. Having robbed Skull Island of its other prehistoric denizens, then one would hope that the screenplay would need to be much stronger in order to pick up the slack for the lack of excitement. Instead, this sports one of the more laughable stories. The search for oil on Skull Island is never very convincing nor are the men searching for it - and the way that Lange's character gets conveniently shoe-horned into the plot is absurd. The dialog is especially groanworthy.While one can credit having Lange's heroine not scream incessantly throughout the film a la Fay Wray,she also fails to elicit our sympathy like the aforementioned iconic Wray and fails to equal the luminous intensity of Naomi Watts in the 2005 remake. Lange was a model just starting out at this point and, although she became a very good actress, she was not at this time seasoned enough to triumph over such an impossible screenplay. The scenes where the ape gives Lange lascivious looks are comical although filmed with the utmost solemnity. Ditto, the sequences at the end where Lange and leading man Jeff Bridges run through the streets of NYC after Kong's escape and she keeps insisting they should stop at a bar to get a drink are downright surreal - is the character a lush or something? The less said about long-haired Jeff Bridges and the far-out-of-his-element Charles Grodin, the better. The producers exchange the Empire State Building for the World Trade Center, but the final moments fail to make the impact or the impression of either the original or the 2005 remake.The end result is a completely lamentable dud sporting incompetence on every level. There is zero to recommend this film and anyone who remembers it fondly is either deranged or indulging in a shameful misguided sense of sentimentality that this film never earned.",King Kong
108,Hessian499,"Entertaining, campy fun",7,7 October 2001,"Spoilers below!King Kong never quite reaches the high water mark the original 1933 movie did, but it is quite good on its own merits. The special effects of the guy in the ape suit are not spectacular as others have mentioned, but are fairly well done and by 1976 standards quite good. The acting is also good, especially the debut of a young Jessica Lange. One drawback of the movie is that it takes a rather liberal slant, and while this in itself is not a bad thing it would have played better in 1968 than in 1976. Jack Prescott is basically a hippie who just happens to be a scientist; he seems outdated in a film in the mid-1970s. Grodin plays the leader of the expedition, and comes across as more dangerous than King Kong in his ruthless quest to find oil. The liberal, questioning tone does not damage the film that much, but it does make it a little less fun than the original.A lot of things are copied from the original 1933 King Kong, however; not only the plot line itself but some smaller points as well. Jessica Lange and Fay Wray both portray down on their luck actresses who end up on the ship mostly by luck or fate; when kidnapped by the natives off the ship, both rip a necklace from one of warriors which leads to the sailors going ashore to rescue them. Both the original Kong and the 1976 version shake exactly four sailors off a log bridge in the jungle. There are many other similarities as well, and it is interesting to watch both versions of the film to find them.While not close to being the classic the original film was, the 1976 version of King Kong is definitely worth watching. When you realize that it is not trying to top the 1933 film, you'll relax and enjoy it for its own good points.",King Kong
109,NutzieFagin,Hail Disco Kong!,7,1 April 2013,"Ahhh the 70's!! Most people disdain the 70's but I grew up in the decade and the movies have fond memories for me. One film I remember was the 1976 remake, King Kong.When news came out about the film, it was heavily touted and publicized. Of course everyone has seen the classic Fay Wray original, can a remake be better? well....yes...and no...This film marked the debut of Jessica Lange and launched her on an acting career. Previously she was a model and heard a casting call for a part for a blond actress for the part of Kong's hapless mate. It was said that they were seriously considering Barbara Striesand (oy vey) for the role. But rumor had it that Babs was VERY demanding so they decided to go with an unknown for the part.Some imaginative special effects are used but by comparison with today's technology, they are considered to be pretty lame. There are major plot changes since the film is set in modern times. First, the gas shortages or ""Energy Crisis"" was alive and well during this time. So it is not surprising that an oil company is made the primary villain in the 70's Kong. Also the environmental movement was starting out and the character of Jack was influenced by it.Much was published that the ""New"" World Trade Center was picked as the building which Kong would make his famous climb on. Looking at it now and seeing films from the past 911 tragedy still gives me a little chill and a sorrow for past days.However, all and all, despite the God forsaken cheesy script, the mechanical gorilla arms etc... I would recommend King Kong 1976 as a popcorn guilty pleasure or cult film. Just see it--like all monster films it is pure fantasy magic.",King Kong
110,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,16 June 2017,"I consider this my favorite movie. I first saw it when I was 4 or 5, I think. It's the first remake of the 1933 version, which is the original. This is light-years better than the original and the 2005 version. A guy stow aways on a ship that is bound to look for oil. The ship heads off. He reveals himself during a presentation and tells a story of a person hearing the roar of the Kong species on the island, I think centuries earlier. As he is taken to be confined somewhere for being a stow away, he sees a raft in the ocean and a woman is unconscious in it and is rescued. She is the only survivor of a boat disaster. She is revived and says her name is Dwan and says what happened, and becomes friends with Jack, who is the stow away. The ship reaches the fog that surrounds the island. Some of the people, including Jack and Dwan, go to the island in a smaller boat. They explore the island and see the wall and the villagers. The villagers are dancing in a ceremony. They see what they think is oil bubbling in a pool in the village. The chief sees them and stops dancing and makes the others stop dancing. They confront each other and the chief sees Dwan and offers to trade six of his women for her. They refuse, of course, and the villagers attack them and are scared away by them shooting in the air. That night, Dwan is kidnapped by some of the villagers and forced to drink a drug which puts her in a dazed state so she doesn't resist. Jack discovers that she's gone and he and others go after her. Dwan is taken through a gate in the wall and tied to two poles by two villagers. They then go back through the gate and it is closed and locked. The villagers make noises and Kong comes and stands in front of Dwan. The villagers become quiet. Dwan looks up and sees Kong. Kong roars and beats his chest. Dwan screams. Kong picks her up and she screams no. He sniffs her and roars. She passes out and he takes her back to the forest. Jack and the others arrive as the villagers celebrate. The villagers are scared away with fireworks and gun shots. The gate is opened and they go through and see fallen trees from Kong. Fred falls into a footprint of Kong, mistaking it for a normal hole. Jack tells him it's a footprint. I'll get less detailed now. There are scenes such as Kong messing with Dwan, Fred finding out that the black liquid won't be workable oil for maybe about 10,000 years so he decides to try to bring Kong back instead, people falling off a tree into a canyon from Kong turning it back and forth, Kong escaping in New York City and other stuff there. Some differences from the original are, in the original, there are several monsters other than Kong on the island, and in this, there is only one, which is a gigantic snake that goes after Dwan and Kong kills by tearing it open. Another thing is, in the original, the guy who falls in love with the main woman is the first mate of the ship, and in this, he's a stow away. Another thing is, Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State Building in the original, and in this, he climbs to the top of one of the twin towers. Another is, in the original, the ship is a film making expedition, and in this, its an oil expedition. Another is, in the original, the main woman is a poor woman that the filmmaker meets, and in this, she's a woman found floating unconscious in a raft. Another is, in the original, there is nothing of the journey from the island to New York City, and in this, there is. There are many other differences, of course. The visual and sound effects in this are amazing. It's a scary and very entertaining movie. It totally blows the original and 2005 versions out of the water. It's rated PG, but it was made before the PG-13 rating existed and by today's rating system standards, it's a PG-13 level movie. There's a sequel to this called King Kong Lives which was released in 1986, and that's really good. Not as good as this, though.",King Kong
111,BatStarIndyFreak,The only Kong I really knew until I was 17,8,6 April 2002,"I had seen the movie several times, and saw many pictures of the original, but never got to see the 1933 until I got AMC. Because of this, I only knew to like this version of the big ape. You have to credit them with how believable Kong was this time around with perfect facial motion for the Kong costume and very well made miniatures. And the costume not fooling anybody? I'd really like to be enlightened about stop-motions ability to fool. Bridges did a splendid job, and his role suited the hippy age, still very fresh in everyone's mind at the time. Lange did well with what she was given in her first big role, but I didn't think it was the best idea to have her as the airhead. I liked Grodin as the meglomaniacal tycoon trying to add depth to his pocket. The thing is I don't think anybody will ever be able to watch this one the same after 9-11.",King Kong
112,trouserpress,"""No one cry when Jaws die! But when the monkey die, everybody gonna cry!""",6,21 October 2006,"In the mid-seventies Hollywood had gone big-budget disaster movie mad. Audiences had been shaken by Earthquake, burned by Towering Inferno (directed by Kong's own Guillerman) and drowned by The Poseidon Adventure. They'd been put off flying by the Airport series and swore never to return to the water thanks to a certain shark movie. De Laurentiis felt that the time was right for yet another special effects epic, and committed $24 million to bringing Kong to a new generation (by way of comparison, Earthquake cost a mere $7 million just two years earlier). He was originally in talks with Roman Polanski to bring this new version to the screen, and one can only imagine what that movie would have been like. Unfortunately there were certain elements Polanski was unsure of (mainly, what to do with a giant ape) which meant the project was passed on to Guillerman, a veteran of the disaster movie.And here is the real crux of the matter: when you watch this film you begin to feel that NO ONE knew what to do with the ape. The film flows nicely along, and is quite enjoyable right up to the moment Kong is first revealed. The director and the cast bring some life and depth to the updated script, involving Grodin's search for a new oil source, finding shipwrecked Lange and stowaway Bridges along the way. They make it to the island and meet some of the natives; so far, so good. But when the atmosphere builds and Kong is finally revealed, it's a downhill slide from here.Kong is played through the majority of the film by special effects maestro Rick Baker. Back in the seventies if the call went out for a guy to dress as an ape, he was first in line. He made his memorable debut playing a two-headed ape in The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant, a film I heartily recommend for a terrific performance from Bruce Dern. In Kong the problems lies mainly in the fact that a man in an ape suite looks like, well, a man in an ape suit, and no amount of trick photography and miniature work disguises this. Kong looks truly ridiculous stomping his way through tiny trees and papier-mâché mountains, and especially during his climactic wrestle with a giant snake. He manages to show expression, particularly in his scenes with Lange's Dwan. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that Dawn changed her name to Dwan to sound more interesting. She states that early in the movie. Well love, it just makes you sound like an idiot. And no one else in the movie can pronounce it properly. As I was saying, Kong has several scenes with Dwan, and his main expression is one of arousal. Yes, Kong finds her sexy. Bridges refers to Kong as a ""Gigantic turned-on ape"", and he's not far wrong. There is a hilarious scene where Kong holds Dwan lovingly in his hand and slowly undresses her with one of his enormous pudgy fingers. I kid you not. And she lets him too, making only the smallest effort to retain her modesty.De Laurentiis did have one ace up his sleeve. Along with his man-in-suit, he had Carlo Rambaldi. Better known for his later work in E.T., Rambaldi built a fully operational, life-size Kong, reaching over forty feet in height. This was going to be the effect that would amaze the audiences. And it does. It amazes you that they bothered at all, because it hardly works, only managing the most basic of facial and body movements. In the end they only used it in a couple of scenes, and the inter-cutting between it and Baker's suit is painfully obvious. One second he's motionless, the next Kong is thrashing around violently, then he's very still again. It's like an ape version of Musical Statues.I could write all day about this movie. In short, you have to see it to believe that such a big film can be so bad, from the dialogue (""What do you think did that? A guy in an ape suit?"" Er, yes?) to the scale models, which appear to have been borrowed from one of the lowest budgeted Godzilla movies. And of course, there's Kong himself, hairy and horny. All he wants is to get it on with Dwan, if only the giant snakes, evil oil companies and armed helicopters would let him.For a PG-rated film, there's a surprising amount of blood and near-nudity in this film. The transfer quality on the DVD is excellent. The film is presented in widescreen, and the audio is clean and loud. As an extra on the R2 DVD you get a bonus disc featuring the official sequel, King Kong Lives, made in 1986 and again directed by Guillerman. This film has to be seen to be believed. It is presented in full screen, and looks like it was transferred from VHS, but you will be rewarded. Linda Hamilton stars as the surgeon who saved Kong's life, courtesy of an artificial heart, but soon lives to regret it when he escapes to get it on with a certain Lady Kong, recently arrived from Borneo. The film features tender scenes of courtship between the apes, and climaxes with Lady Kong giving birth whilst King Kong takes missiles in the chest from the military. It is played dead straight, with Hamilton weeping in the corner whilst the orchestral music swells. It is one of the funniest things I've seen in quite some time. The fact that Hamilton did this movie after Terminator shows she really needed another agent.",King Kong

114,rorymacveigh,It's OK I guess...,6,19 September 2012,"Following the completion of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center as New York City's tallest and most Iconic structures, it was obvious that filmmakers were going to involve these two buildings in a monster movie somewhere along the line, and most likely have the monster climb the towers, jump from one tower to the other, or stand on both towers at the same time, you get the idea. Being one of the most famous monsters to ever rock Manhattan with his presence, King Kong was certainly one for the running and so in 1976, King Kong made another appearance in the City that Never Sleeps. Starring Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, the film I find is quite good in some aspects but falls down in others.The story is the basic Ape Escape drama, a group of explorers come across a backwater island where native's attempt to sacrifice Jessica Lange's character to King Kong who forms a relationship with the girl only to find himself fighting a giant snake or dinosaur which allows Jeff Bridge's character to save Jessica Lange's character which leads Kong into a trap set by a wealthy businessman who wants to exploit the towering beastie in order to add millions onto the millions he's already got but Kong escapes and goes on a rampage in New York eventually leading to the capture of Jessica Lange's character which results in Kong climbing the tallest building around and eventually being shot down by aeroplanes or helicopters which results in the emotional death scene at the end...So that's the story, what about the rest. To be honest, the acting is quite good even though it has been made really very 70s with some of the essentially 'hippee' undertones by Jeff Bridges character. Jessica Lange is the pretty air-headed damsel in distress who really can't keep out of harm's way for more than five or six minutes. The model work is pretty good, especially with King Kong taking Subway Trains and throwing them through the air before beating up Military Helicopters and the soundtrack is also fairly good as well. Although many people have panned this film because it's been considered a cheap knock off of the 1933 masterpiece, I don't think so to be perfectly honest, it's quite quirky in it's own way and remain's pretty faithful to the story. I'd recommend it as a Wet Saturday Afternoon sort of film, but apart from that, it's nothing superbly special.",King Kong
115,chez-3,Guilty pleasure,7,27 August 1999,"When this film was released at Christmas of 1976 it was billed as ""the motion picture event of our time."" Now it seems a bit extreme but as an eager 11 year old I was sucked in. Looking at it today I admit it's certainly far from being a motion picture event. But the film has its virtues none more so then the fine performances by Jeff Bridges and Charles Grodin (in an unusual villianous role). And let's not forget the beautiful musical score by John Barry.The special effects are pretty cheap in many scenes so don't be looking for top notch in that category. I don't know....on the whole it's really not that great but I must confess that every time it is on television I watch it. This is a true guilty pleasure.",King Kong
116,reapercrew-05584,One of my favorite movies of all time!!,10,26 January 2021,"I like this version a lot because, this film wants to focus on the love story that's why there is no dinosaurs in it but they did put a giant snake in it though and Jessica Lange plays Dwan in this film that's right she is not Ann anymore... she is Dwan!!! I like the change in this version and people keep comparing it to the original but it tells its one story and this roar for king is just amazing and this is the only film in the whole series to feature the twin towers!!! And I like it that it is more modernized and there is even a deleted version for this film!! Which was a while 3 hours!!! And featured even more stuff for this version and when people say it was like ""was it beauty that killed the beast or, was Beast the killed beauty?"" (And I give credit to bigjackfilms for most of these lines)",King Kong
117,Jamie-58,'A' for effort,5,9 September 1999,"Though generally regarded as inferior to the 1933 classic - which it unquestionably is - this remake of ""King Kong"" can at least boast the virtue of trying to be different. No mere rehash of the older film, the story has been reinterpreted, and very occasionally the effort pays off.I rather like the notion of the explorers arriving at Kong's island with no idea of what they are going to find. The discovery of the wall - telegraphed in the original, and thus less powerful - the natives, the overall look of the island works very well.Sadly its downhill from there. The highly touted special effects are poor. Kong is so obviously a man in an ape suit that it seems astonishing that anyone was duped by tales of giant robots. (That much publicised automaton, when it briefly appears, is ragingly bogus.) Toning down Kong's ferocity was another huge mistake. In this version he is a cross eyed lover, with little menace. In the original he was a possessive and protective lover, with a real mean streak. It worked better. And Jessica Lange lacks Fay Wray's unique blend of innocence and sex appeal. She aims at ditziness, and is merely irritating. How you'll pray that Kong makes a meal of her!Its hard to dismiss memories of the 1933 film when it was so much more engaging. But this isn't too bad in a kiddie matinee fashion.",King Kong
118,Horror_Metal,King Kong (1976) is a great remake but not near as good as the original,7,25 November 2005,"I have made it clear that I've been a huge Kong fan nearly my whole life. I always tried to avoid this remake knowing that it could very well ruin the original for me and possibly even spoil my love for the King Kong movies. I owned the first three Kong films on VHS (King Kong, Son of Kong, and Kong Kong Vs. Godzilla) and never really considered this part of the series and decided it was just a rehash to be avoided. But one time my mom told me that this film was deeper than the '33 original and made you actually cry when King Kong died.She thought this movie was better! Now I know that wasn't true but I took my mom's advice and checked this movie out when it came on TV a few years ago. I wasn't blown away but I must say I really enjoyed it and had a great action/drama/romance roller-coaster with this fun movie. This movie did have better action and emotion than the original (I actually did get sad when Kong died as I never did before, there I said it!) but I just lacked something. The absence of the dinosaurs was a major downfall and the realistic take on the character was something I never liked as even though he looked more like a giant gorilla than the old Kong, he wasn't even half as fun to watch. There were things about this movie I liked better than the original but when it all adds up, there is no comparison. King Kong '33 wins by a long shot. It is hard I might add not to compare the two films but even as a stand alone movie, this 70s remake was not completely what I wanted. The new characters were actually modern versions of the old ones just with different names (Jack Driscoll-Jack Prescott, Carl Denham- Fred Wilson, Ann Darrow-Dwan and so on) and I appreciated them on a certain level although this version of Carl/Fred was more sleazy and all I saw was his jerk side. He deserved being flattened by Kong's foot. Jessica Lange was better eye candy then Fay Wray and made for an intriguing love interest to Kong. She also brought the whole beauty and the beast/his love for women is his downfall theme to a slightly greater level. Everyone did their part well but my favorite was Jeff Bridges as Jack Prescott. He was a true heroic nature lover and the exact opposite of Fred Wilson I just bought it on DVD today along with King Kong Lives (1986) and added them to my collection of Kong Kong DVDs (King Kong Vs. Godzilla and King Escapes will be joining them in four days!). In all fairness, King Kong '76 is definitely a worthy entry to the huge Kong series and has remained one of my favorites for some time now. Can't wait to see the second remake of King Kong in a month, it will be the motion picture event of the year for me and probably a lot better than this movie (but not the '33 original). King Kong '76 is a great remake but not as good as the original! I give this great attempt at a modernization of a classic tale an 8/10!",King Kong
119,ZookGuy,The Best Remake I've Ever Seen,10,23 May 2007,"Benig a fan of the 1933 King Kong, my family obviously knew this so one of my Christmas presents was the 1933 version and this version (Peter Jackson's version (thankfully wasn't out yet.) And this was not better than the original, it's a dang good match for it. Charles Grodin did a fantastic job as the greedy oil company owner that we are strangely feel sorry for him when he dies. Jessica Lange did a good job too. But Jeff Bridges however, was superb as his role as a scientist/environmentalist who'll be very, I repeat, very angry if they kill Kong, which they sadly, in the end, do.The directors (including the one and only Dino De Laurietes)obviously realized from the start that they could not duplicate the spirit created in the original (another mistake Peter Jackson did) they decided to go for modern and replace it the Empire State Building with the World Trade center (which makes this Kong death a grim reminder of 9/11) and added more dark humor, but it's almost impossible impossible for being angry at them for leaving out the dinosaurs.",King Kong
120,mathijsschaap,The Kong from my generation,8,18 September 2015,"This is the King Kong movie from my year of birth. It gave me nightmares as a young child, but I've always loved the movie.I disliked the 1986 sequel 'King Kong Lives' but this one -to me- is still very likable. I love the humor and the acting is at its best.Yes, the effects are outdated and not convincing anymore, but at least it were live action effects and back then way more convincing than the CGI of today. Yes, Kong is the guy in a suit, but there was no Andy Serkis around back then or other actors who were capable of studying gorilla's and their movements (concidering the idea that Kong has to be a giant gorilla, instead of another unspecified unique primate), but later films had even worse convincing apes ('Trading places', 'Greystoke, the legend of Tarzan', 'Gorillas in the Mist', etc.).I just finished watching it today since like 30 years and I was surprised how good the acting was. I've never seen the 1933 movie, but I did see Peter Jackson's version. I prefer this one over Peter Jackson's version, because Jackson's version is too long in running time and boring from the moment with the giant insects on.Kong is the metaphor, the Carl Jung kind of archetype, that represents the dark and fierce side of nature that fascinates us. The story is a mirror to us, the other primates, showing us how stupid we are when we think we can dominate nature and bend it to our will, and destroying it when we discover we can't, because we are too proud to confess how stupid we were in the first place instead of admitting that we should have let nature alone.",King Kong
121,slothropgr,One of the worst remakes ever,2,1 September 2006,"""When my Kong-a die, every body cry! Teachers, intellectuals, everybody!"" Thus spake John Belushi as Dino De Laurentiis on SNL, and was he wrong! When this Kong-a died, I breathed a sigh of relief-a and regretted the time spent-a watching it. Talk about lacking a clue as to the difference between the letter and the spirit of the original! There were a few good things: unlike either the first or latest, it did show how they got the big ape off the island to New York, and the scene where Jessica L talks to him in the ship's hold was touching. Some of the opticals when KK was climbing the WTC were gorgeous. But everything else--fuhgetabouddit! The fx were awful. A complete list would take pages and pages, so I'll mention just a few. On the island they didn't even bother to match colors between the live action (green) and the studio ape suit fx (red). There was one monster, a snake that harked back to the octopus in ""Bride of the Gorilla."" One shot, of Kong smashing a gunship, was blatantly repeated. And the NYC model was totally empty and sterile-clean when he went for his stroll--sniffing out the heroine!! What could be funnier?? Rick Baker did what he could with the ape suit but it wasn't much. I've created a special ""Survivor"" award for actors and actresses who manage to make careers after awful kickoffs like this one. It's called the Jessica in honor of Ms. Lange, from whom I never expected to hear again (the 2nd recipient was Michelle Pfeiffer for surviving ""Grease 2""). The only real consolation is that this atrocity actually, unbelievably, Could Have Been Worse--originally Dino D wanted to use the wretched full-sized robot used in the stadium scene for the WHOLE PICTURE! And this guy had actually made moves before! I understand Willis O'Brien's widow wept at ""King Kong vs Godzilla""--what tears she would've shed at this thing.",King Kong
122,rexmagicman,Well how about that!! Dwan is actually a real name!,10,23 May 2021,"What does Dwan mean? Dwan as a name for girls is of Old English derivation, and Dwan means ""the first appearance of light, daybreak"". Dwan is a variant form of Dawn. I just recently purchased the Blu-ray by Shout factory, and what an amazing transfer restoration they did! I saw this originally in the theatre as a young teen when it came out, and then many times after that on VHS and DVD --- this Blu-ray blows the previous versions away, by far. The log scene has never looked so good, and the majority of the effects are tremendous. I've always been a fan of King Kong since I was a child, starting with the 1933 version. And Peter Jackson's version I thought was beautifully rendered and I've watched that on Blu-ray many times. But, to me, this 1976 version is still the best one. Love the story line, the John Barry score to me is probably his best work (haunting, beautiful, lyrical, memorable), and the acting by everyone is fantastic. You can see why Jessica Lange went on to become the star that she is --- what a debut! She is so captivatingly beautiful, in a natural way --- and the onscreen chemistry between her and Jeff Bridges is 100% believable. She is just alluring and heavenly to watch in every scene. Yes, some of the dialogue is silly, but it is in all three movies, and after all, this was the '70s. Charles Grodin is an absolute hoot, with some of the best lines ever uttered on film (I absolutely howl every time at the ""tap dancing for Rotary clubs"" line). And yes, it IS a man in an ape suit for most of the film, but it works (for me at least) --- after watching this restored Blu-ray, it's very impressive on how the overall film and effects look. The finale on top of the World Trade Center is thrilling and heart-wrenching as Kong protects Dwan as he battles the oncoming helicopters blasting away at him. I'm still fond of the 1933 version, and although I enjoy the Peter Jackson version, it is somewhat of an endurance test. This version clocks in at just a little over 2 hours, and there's truly not one moment wasted here....goes by very fast, and is an amazing adventure. I'm giving it 10 stars, as it deserves a MUCH higher rating than the 5.9 that it has, and has held up very well over the years.",King Kong
123,tavives,Not as good as I remember,5,29 October 2011,"Just watched this on Epix. I hadn't seen it in 30 some odd years. Although it had its moments, and for 1976 the effects were pretty darn good, Chuck Grodin's performance is so over the top it is almost unwatchable. Same for Rene Auberjonois (sp) Jeff Bridges is OK, Jessica Lange (thank God) would go on to much better things and acclaim, but here....meh.Some folks have been talking about John Barry's Score. It's OK and fits, but he wrote nearly the same score for several James Bond movies (""For Your Eyes Only"" in particular) and there are parts of it that sound almost shockingly similar to his Oscar winning score for ""Dances with Wolves"".I did still enjoy the story and thought it was quite well thought out and presented.I also thought that it was still better than the 2005 version.I guess the moral of this is you can't always go home, or at least you may find that the streets have changed so much you can't get there.",King Kong
124,quantumcat,worth watching,6,14 July 2008,"People seem to bash this movie a lot. For good reasons. it is desperately inferior to the original.As a kid, I liked this one, though I preferred the original, sure it's in Colour, Stereo (now 5.1) and it has ""better"" special effects. True: The man-in-a-suit approach doesn't always work, but so does stop motion. It is maybe the best they could have come up with in the seventies, without having to call in Ray Harryhausen.The actors are good, there's nothing wrong with the acting. the music by John Barry has you thinking James Bond'll show up any minute and rescue the girl. AlasI think the biggest problem with this movie is the script.The pacing is too slow and doesn't have a lot of action... or monsters. But boy, do we want to see the inhabitants of Kong island! Especially with the new and improved special effects.After seeing this movie after so many years, I realize they tried to make the characters believable, with each a credible reason to set foot on king island. The result, is a slow start, which is just bearable not to fast forward the movie. And when they reach Kong Island, the biggest disappointment, is the lack of inhabitants for Kong to fight with. When Kong's finally captured (after 1,5 hrs of movie, you still have about 45 minutes before he falls to his Death from the World Trade Centre.Okay, I know, also long and at times slow. but that version succeeded in making the slow bits compelling enough not to lose interest. And it had a lot of Kong's island and creatures.Having said that, the 1976 version is not as bad as some people want you to believe. it's not as good as some want you to believe either. I think it's a mediocre attempt in to remaking a classic. The resulting movie is worth to watch!",King Kong
125,lotsafun,A GUILTY PLEASURE FOR SURE- I LOVE IT!,10,29 November 2004,"Another poster called this Kong a guilty pleasure. I agree. It's flawed and the special effects are not very special by today's standards and there's a lot of silly stuff. I won't argue about any of that. It's all true. And so what? I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love the flaws and the not-so-special effects and all of the silly stuff. I enjoyed Dwan's comment about telling Prescott's sign by his ears and all of her silly lines to Kong. Jessica Lange is beautiful, lovely, and wonderful. Jeff Bridges is excellent too and how can ya not hate Charles Grodin in this? He's the character I most love to hate! Great work! King Kong himself is always entertaining in this even if he is incredibly goofy at times depending on which special effect they used. The giant robot Kong just kills me! LOL! I loved it! When they use an actor in a costume it works better and dammit this Kong has got the most soulful eyes! My heart strings were tugged by this sweet and silly movie. POOR KONG! HE'S JUST LOOKIN' FOR LOVE! WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE?! I guess if they did there'd be no movie. No this isn't a perfect movie but I agree with the poster who said this movie is an old friend. All of the flaws are part of it's charm and I've had a wonderful time with this Kong.",King Kong
126,gpaltrow2001,Laughably bad (and I used to like it as a kid),1,29 June 2009,"I tried to give this a 3. Then a 2. But really, this is an awful film. It gets a 1. And I'm pretty generous with schlocky type movies.I saw this as a 14 year-old, and I liked it. Now I suspect even 14 year-olds will find it corny.The effects, acting, directing, and plot are all bad.(I thoroughly enjoyed the recent Peter Jackson remake. I wonder if I'll laugh at that in 20 years?) Jessica Lange has bad teeth, fake boobs, an unbelievable character that spouts laugh-out-loud dialogue, and chews the scenery (which is hard to do against Kong). Go see her in 'Frances' instead.Rick Baker walking around in a monkey suit looks like, well, a guy walking around in a gorilla suit.The rubber hands bend as they grab Dwan (omg, even her name is funny, and listen to her explain it in the dialogue).There is no chemistry between the two leads.Carlo Rambaldi, the special effects guy, does much better work a few years later on 'E.T.'. His Kong stuff looks amateurish. It was a thankless, impossible task to build a 'giant robot' Kong! Lol, just typing that is funny.Even the last shot is funny, as some goofball is waving to the camera. I'll bet to this day he is proud of that (you can see it in the upper left).I could go on and on. This is NOT a guilty pleasure for me, as some post. This is cornball junk, and poorly-made to boot.I looked up the top ten grossing films for 1976. King Kong is number 5. Every other film on that list is better, and that is a 'populist' decree, not critics'. 'Rocky', 'Silver Streak', 'The Omen', 'Marathon Man', 'All the President's Men', etc. Go see those.",King Kong

I remembered it being bad, but I had mercifully forgotten just how bad it is! From the lame attempts to inject an environmental slant to the cartoon characters to the total lack of any sort of excitement, this movie simply has nothing going for it. For a film which was quite expensive in its time the production values are miserable. Kong's island looks just like Hawaii until you get inside the wall (a bunch of sticks) when it becomes just a handful of fake rocks and a miniature tree or two. The scenes where Kong ""rampages"" through a suddenly empty Manhattan are substantially less fun (and less convincing) than even the worst of the old Godzilla movies. Rick Baker has proved himself the master of the ape suit, but you wouldn't know it from the costume he wears in this thing --- he looks like he should be menacing Abbott and Costello. All in all a movie without a single redeeming quality.Wait a second, I take that back. Jessica Lange is cute as hell.",King Kong
130,awpangle,"Great fun, from beginning to end.",7,11 February 1999,"This remake of the 1930s classic is great. It is entertaining, engrossing, and so classic you have to love it. It is fast paced too, which is something most remakes aren't. The new King Kong is packed with all new twists and turns, it never stops because something is always going on, even if you've seen the original, you never know whats going to happen next. The finale in New York is very well done and very surprising. The Oscar winning special effects are excellent, and then again in some scenes they're not. But hey it is a 70s movie, and for the time they're great in this movie. The acting was another great feature, Grodin and Bridges are excellent as usual, but it was newcomer Lange who really gave her and the picture it's fame. She is gorgeous, and plays the role of Dwan better the Fay Wray did, it also earned her her first Golden Globe for her first movie. Believe me this King Kong is a whole lotta fun from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics go rent it. *** out of ****",King Kong
131,busterbuff61,Kong for the Nixon era,4,10 January 2013,"The most unfortunate line of dialogue in the 1976 version of ""King Kong"" is when Jack Prescott (Jeff Bridges), as proof of Kong's existence, points to jungle debris and says, ""Who do you think made that mess – some guy in an ape suit?"" Unfortunately, that's *exactly* what I think.In between the original 1933 version of ""King Kong"" (a classic and the best version –- no arguments allowed) and Peter Jackson's 2005 version (which put me off but obviously has its fans), there came producer Dino De Laurentiis' version –- which, to cop a much-used phrase from Roger Ebert, knew the words but not the music.The movie attempts to ""modernize"" the story with a plot line that, surprisingly, is halfway serviceable. Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin), a greedy executive of an oil company named Petrox (""Pet Rocks,"" isn't that cute?), is sailing his crew to an uncharted island that promises hoards of oil that will help Petrox lead the way during the '70s energy crisis. It's kind of sad that the original movie's Jack Denham, a happy-go-lucky adventurer who wanted the island for an exotic movie setting, is here transmogrified into a villain. But Grodin does such a great job as the chop-licking bad guy, you're willing to settle.Stowing away on the Petrox ship is Prescott, an ""environmentalist professor"" who tries to show Wilson the political incorrectness of his greedy ways. But Wilson cares only to exact his pound of flesh from Prescott; the price Prescott must pay for illegally boarding the ship is to be the trip's photographer. Prescott acquiesces to this gesture surprisingly quickly.But even before we see Kong, the plot point that sinks this movie is when a would-be actress named Dwan (an unfortunate film debut for Jessica Lange) is recovered from a raft at sea. It seems that a moviemaker on an ocean liner had promised her stardom just before a fateful wave washed away the ship and everyone on it except for Dwan. But when Dwan starts spouting hippie-girl talk and predicting everyone's astrological sign, one wishes Dwan had gone down with the ship.The story proceeds very quickly to the island and through the native's ritual of sacrificing a goddess (who, of course, eventually turns out to be Dwan) to Kong. It's when Kong shows up that the movie's street cred sinks for good. After seeing an inanimate clay figure brought to astounding life in the 1933 version, it's obvious and disappointing that the long shots depict only a man in a gorilla suit (special effects artist Rick Baker) –- although even he does a better job than the Carlo Rimbaldi-designed Kong robot, which was much ballyhooed at the time but was usable only for a few shots. (Rimbaldi went on to better things with Steven Spielberg, for whom he designed the iconic extra-terrestrial creature ""E.T."" But even if Kong had been more convincing, poor Jessica Lange couldn't be less convincing. You'll never realize what a fine job Fay Wray did in the original until –- in the movie's other prize-winning howler –- you hear Dwan shouting, ""Put me down, you g****** chauvinist pig ape!"" The movie's last great debit is that it looks and sounds like a 1970s TV-movie, not even a theatrical one. Despite its padded budget, the movie is so gun-shy that the exotic and scary jungle animals of the first movie are reduced here to a single, slithering snake that battles Kong. John Guillermin's direction is very pedestrian –- no sense of dread or fun to mar the movie's workmanlike march to its inevitable conclusion. And John Barry's generic score is hardly a shadow of Max Steiner's groundbreaking work in the original.The part that should have worked better was the climax's re-imagining from the Empire State Building to the then-timely (now tragic, of course) World Trade Center. At movie's end, Lange finally starts to suggest the vulnerability that was Naomi Watts' forte in the 2005 version. But by then, it is all too little, too late.",King Kong
132,doneil4,My favourite version of King Kong,10,25 October 2020,"I honestly have no idea where a lot of these negative reviews have come from. There is nothing wrong with the 76' version of King Kong. I mean of course the original will forever be a classic. No denying that. But it sure beats the 2005 version. This version despite being a remake, actually tried to be original in it's own way. Where's Peter Jackson's film just copied the entire plot of the original but tried making up for it with special effects.Now while we're on the subject of special effects, yes I will admit in this version they're now rather dated. But for a movie made in the 70's they're certainly not terrible. Rather than bashing the effects I see it this way, that a lot of hard work went it to making this film to look as good as it possibly could during that era for such a film.Well now we have that out the way, what is it about the 76' version that stands out to me? Well.. a great cast for one thing. The dude himself Jeff Bridges played a great Male protagonist, and what I love about his character is he isn't your typical guy who just wants the girl and would rather see Kong dead. He grows to care for Kong because he understands that an ape of his size is a once in a lifetime animal that shouldn't just be destroyed. Then we have Charles Grodin, the complete opposite to Bridges character. Grodin's character is a typical money oriented Antagonist that doesn't really care about anybody but himself, just aslong as he gets a big paycheck in the end. But he certainly fits in well with the story. And then there's Jessica Lange, who makes her film debut. And she does a brilliant job. I once read she wasn't happy with her performance in this film which is why she didn't act again until about 4 years later to take up acting lessons, which I'm very surprised about because I think she does a great a job, even Jeff Bridges has vouched for that. I'll get to the point now, you certainly haven't got anything to worry about with the performances.What else can I say about this version? The score is great. The cinematography is really good. Just a very a good remake overall. So don't overlook this version until you've seen it for yourself. It's probably one of my favourite films altogether.",King Kong
133,McKiller,I remember this when I was 9,7,30 August 2000,"I actually vividly remember going to see this movie when it came out in 1976.  I was 9, and I liked it alot.  I have since seen it another 2 or 3 times.  I was very surprised to see that Jessica  Lange nailed a Golden Globe for her performance.  It was great considering it was a remake and it was made in the 70's.  The story line was better than the original, but the whole ""mysterious island"" shrouded in fog seem way off base to me.  Now that I am 33 anyway. Boy, she was a nice piece back then.  What the hell happened to her?  Grodin was great too.   He has sure turned out to be majorly lame. Should have stuck with acting Charles.  Your talk show bites the big one.  I don't even think you're on the air anymore.  I sure hope not.",King Kong
134,LaserPoint,A true Kong re-imagining,7,29 October 2010,"You know having re-watched the 1976 version a few days ago, my opinion on the film has drastically changed. I actually appreciate it for having the guts and determination to re-image this great tale by taking it in a completely different direction without disrespecting or ignoring the source material it stays faithful to. It doesn't rehash the original film nor does it update on its context, it borrows the basic concept of obviously a giant overgrown Ape on a strange island when its symbolized as a god only this time an expedition of the ""Petrox"" company is exploring in search of petrol when the girl is captured by the Ape and is fantasized about here. One of the general complaints about this film is that there are no dinosaurs located on the island, but it seemed to me that the film was trying to lead into a more realistic and believable approach rather then a straight up fun fantasy about shooting and violence. That's not to say that I dislike the 1933 or 2005 versions, in fact I still greatly prefer them to the '76 version, but I can understand the intentions in terms of the new ideas and concepts they were trying to inflict on the story this time around. The relationship between Kong and the girl was kept at a happy medium without being too scared and feeling nothing like in 1933, or being too friendly and not at all scared like in '05, so I thought the balance worked well apart from a few corny scenes in between. So all in all, I'd bump the rating up from a 4/10 to a 7/10 making it my third favorite Kong film behind the original and '05 remake. It's amazing what a re-watch can do with an open mind on the prospective.",King Kong
135,Trashbag,proves you shouldn't monkey around with classics,2,21 July 2003,"*(half)outta *****
Dino DeLaurentis' remake proves that you shouldn't monkey around with classics, especialy the 1933 King Kong.
Warning: Spoilers
The movie maker, Carl Denham in the original has been replaced by FredWilson, a greedy oil explorer. Jack Driscol replaced by Jack Prescott, and Ann Darrow replaced by Dwan. Wilson and his crew try to find oil on a remote island, with stow-away Jack Prescott. They find Dwan floating on a lifeboat and take her on the boat. Soon, they get to the island, and find that the island is the home of some natives. When they are back on the boat, the natives kidnap Dwan and introduce her to none other than King Kong. He takes her away and falls in love with her. The crew rescues Dwan, and captures Kong as a display. Of course Kong escapes and causes a rampage through New York. He kidnaps Dwan, climbs the World Trade Center,, and falls to his death.
Dino DeLaurentis lied to us about that robot Kong they were building. All we get is an ape suit(a very good ape suit, though). Not very faithful to the original either. Dwan actually is trying to protect Kong, and weeps his death. And ""Beauty killed the Beast"" wasn't mentioned. This time, it was the airplanes that killed Kong.",King Kong
136,salcocco,A Great Adventure Movie!,8,17 February 2013,"Oh, this movie is very underrated, I think! It's a great adventure movie from the seventies. Very traditional, but also very entertaining. And above all, John Barry's beautiful music score!Jessica Lange looks like an angel, so very beautiful. You can not not fall in love with her. Charles Grodin plays a fantastic role as the opportunistic leader of the expedition. And Jeff Bridges is as good as Jeff Bridges always is.I must have been 15 when I saw this movie for the first time. I always liked the story of King Kong, and I did see the 1933 movie. I liked that movie very much and it made me want to go to New York. But then this movie came along. I was flabbergasted! I loved it! What a great adventure!!! And what a sad story it really is. And I had to go New York!!!Now, today, February 17, 2013, I did see the movie again. And just like the first time, I fell in love with Jessica Lange all over again. And what a real adventure, and what a beautiful music and ... I really have to go to New York again soon! And all this from a simple movie. A very underrated movie. Shame on you!",King Kong
137,bigjackfilms,My Favorite Film Of All Time!,10,4 April 2014,"The 1970's. The original 1933 King Kong is everywhere, playing on TV constantly and getting a re-release in cinemas in 1973. The fan base is growing, and the film begins to inspire future filmmakers. Though fans love the original, they thought it was time for Hollywood to do a proper remake in widescreen and in color. What came out was the 1976 Remake, which in my opinion is the best Kong film and my favorite film of all time. I'm in love with this film. It's a Beautiful Epic Magnum Opus. It's a big movie, and I mean BIG, both in scope, story, characters and effects. In 1975, producer Dino De Laurentiis had an obsession to make a film bigger than Steven Spielberg's Jaws, the top-grossing film of all-time, so he set to remake King Kong. Dino signed the deal with RKO, then out of nowhere Universal came into the scene and a titanic lawsuit battle began. With a race between the two studios on who would do it first, Dino acted fast and got the best people to help. Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s writing is very strong. Not only the love story, but also dealing with environmental issues and the horrible greed of man. This coming from the man who wrote the 1966 Batman Show. John Gullerman directed the film, giving it its incredible delivery and epic feel. The cast is perfect. Jeff Bridges is finally (Pre 76 Kong Films) an interesting protagonist, playing a man constantly switching sides, torn between love and power. Charles Grodan is a slimy hateful villain, who will stop at anything, even the safety of his fellow crew members to get his way. And in the end his death is well deserved. Finally, the beautifully gorgeous and stunning Jessica Lange, delivers an outstanding performance as the Beauty Who Charmed The Beast. Her character at first like the original is frightened of Kong, but during the time they're together, she realizes he's not a monster, he's lonely and eventually grows to love and does not want him exploited. And it's because of her that he dies. The location and sets, perfect! The Pertox Explorer is a fantastic looking ship. Though different, stays on par with The Venture from the original. Most of Skull Island was filmed on the island of Kauai, its view beautifully filmed showing the lush greenery, waterfalls and beaches. great wall looks incredible, allot of detail went into it. New York is well photographed, both real and miniature. The World Trade Center almost sparkles in the night, giving that haunting feel of the now gone structures. And the amount of extras throughout the film did a fantastic job. Which brings us to the special effects, though not as memorable as the classic Stop Motion Animation from the original are still stunning to look at. The miniature jungles, caves, houses and environment are amazing. The Giant Ape was used with many different effects, one using full scale pieces. Kong's arms, feet and even a full size Kong were created by Carlo Rambaldi, whose animatronics still look incredible to this day. Although the Kong Robot failed, the majority of Kong's full size action and incredible performance would be done by a Man In A Suit by Rick Baker. His performance is unforgettable and unbelievable both in facial features and in body. As a kid, he scared me with his vicious teeth and demonic yet innocent red eyes. And as time went on, his character grew on me, which is the whole idea of the character of Kong. The Editing is fast pace and exciting. But for those who think it's too fast, there is a solution. When Kong made a TV debut in 1979 on NBC, 45 minutes of additional scenes were cut back into the film, making the run time from 2 hours to 3. While most of the new footage is filler, its does have many elements and scenes that you feel were left out of the picture. But props to Ralph E Winters for giving us two cuts of classic 70s cinema. The Sound Effects are great. The background sounds of the jungle are soothing to listen to. Although Kong's roar is a stock dinosaur roar from The Land Unknown, some of Kong's vocals were created by legendary voice actor Peter Cullen. And his animal voice is perfect. Finally there's the music. It's by far one of the best things in the film and one of my favorite scores. Written and composed by John Barry. His score gives a very haunting romantic tone. To me this tops the Max Steiner score. The Opening is epic with its moments using an organ. But it's the love theme that sticks out, a memorable piece, leaving a tear in my eye. This is where the ending comes into play. Its strong and its big. Its suspenseful, terrifying, incredible and heartbreaking. Kong is not on the Twin Towers to fight in a classy action scene against the choppers, but to protect the one he loves, and it cost him his life. Falling from grace and broken hearten. I cry every time I see that scene. What we see hear is the greed of man. Our reaction is to hate and question what we've become. Sadly, the film is picked on and getting bashed for its unfair comparisons to the 1933 and 2005 films and I'm hating the backlash. This is its own movie with its own story. It's not supposed to be the original, it's its own take on it, meaning they can do what they want with it and not use all the original source material. It's big in scope and its version of the Beauty & The Beast tale is the best adaptation. The whole movie is boiled down to the love story between Kong and Dwan and during the climax I cry every time I watch it. It's a very underrated and unappreciated film. Check it out, it's a beautiful epic masterpiece.",King Kong

139,TrentReznorandAtticusRoss,Chills!!,7,7 July 2012,"This seemingly dark adaption to Merian C Cooper's and Egdar Wallace's has proved itself to be - an enjoyable and uncanningly talented piece of work. Dino De Laurentiis' team up with John Gullermin to remake a seminal horror/action classic has turned it into a new dimension unexplored and well deserved. Be warned, this version holds you firmly in it's palm, and doesn't let go.The performances are what make the film a bit more bearable once you realize that the characters that intend to sail to Kong's domain of ancient evil aren't going there to capture him on film or, capture anything at all. Instead, we're faced with filthy money-grubbing men who care nothing for anything else except the one thing that will score them big money - oil. Although, watching a handful of people trying to make a film with 1930's equipment can get a little irritating and somewhat boring. So, setting it in the modern, like the 1933 original did in it's time, seemed like the right thing to do. Jessica Lange's character, Dwan, does take time getting used to, but her affection for Jeff Bridges' character, Jack Prescott, is the only thing that makes her worth watching.Speaking of which, how does this ditsy Dwan end up sailing across the high-seas with oil harvesters? Well, there's a little twist that ends up making the chemistry between Jack - who turns out to be a stowaway - even more exciting. More to the point of chemistry, Gullermin focuses more on the chemistry between Kong and Dwan. A little too much, perhaps, but through this we see the most fantastic performance out of Jessica Lange. The films climax can be seen as a little ridiculous to the other eye, but is still tear worthy. The bond between Kong and Dwan is more touching than Kong's farewell. Lange proves herself worthy during the films climax, once we hear he scream, 'Don't kill him!! Don't KILL HIM!!' The special effects are quite amazing - Kong has been constructed and performed brilliantly, by the wonderful Rick Baker. The sets are quite a spectacle themselves. The miniatures are probably the most convincing ones that cinema has ever seen. The island sets (whether they truly are sets, they still attract the eye) express more characterized, moody and dark elements than you would normally find in real cultures. Oh, and John Barry's score is simply and utterly, amazing. It gives me chills every single time it's cue is due. Probably the best tracks of the film are 'Full Domain - Beauty is a Beast', and 'Arrival on the Island', 'Sacrifice - Hail to the King' - but all tracks are great and are definitely a real triumph.The atmosphere is probably the thing I love most about this movie. I always love watching it, and looking at the hills in the background, and wondering.. 'What lurks over there?' The thing about this, is that if it was made anywhere else, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. The island itself is quite a hellish place, in the fact that it's almost like a desert, with shallow jungle. So, you end up wondering, 'How does a forty-five foot two legged gorilla end up living here?' It's a great mystery, that will only lead you watching the film countless times just to find clues. There also isn't much wildlife on Skull Island - just Kong, and a giant snake that he faces in defending his love, Dwan... You then end up wondering, 'Where the heck did the snake came from? Are there more?' People call these plot holes, but I call this the perfect atmosphere that cinema has given in quite some time.",King Kong
140,Anig-2,Amazing,8,13 July 1999,"This movie has everything: a tried & tested plot, some good special effects (for the time), some decent acting, a lovely lead couple (Jeff Bridges & Jessica Lange), some heart-wrenchingly romantic music (especially the main theme), and the ability to make the viewers want to believe the story. I think this film is heavily under-rated. People are so quick nowadays to label colour remakes as poor bastardisations of the original ""classics"". I haven't seen the original, but it doesn't matter: this is a great film.",King Kong
141,quake-4,That's It?,1,7 December 1999,"Remakes of classics start out in trouble because they have a lot to live up to. This remake succeeded in failing to do just that, improve on the original.  The special effects aren't much better than a high school production, and the acting and directing are better left without comment. All the great scenes from the original, i.e, the Kong battles with other creatures (save for one terribly fake snake fight), the battle in the native village, and much of the New York mayhem was eliminated and often replaced with a guy walking around in a monkey suit doing lots of wild arm gestures. The relationship between Kong and the girl is well established many, many times. In the original, Kong's affection for her is exhibited by his willingness to often fight to the death for her.  This version uses lots of eye contact and tender moments as if Kong had read ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"".  The final fight on top of the World Trade Center is nicely done, and I do think Kong's plunge to his death and final moments are a little better than the original.  (The heart-beat sequence is quite unique.) Overall, I feel that a movie, with nearly 40 years of technology development between it and the original, should outdo the original in at least some areas.  This one does not.  After watching it, one is provoked into asking the question, ""That's It?""",King Kong
142,violencegang,Second Time Unlucky?,7,23 February 2006,"On the list of terrible crimes people have committed throughout history, in some people's eyes Dino De Laurentis' decision to remake King Kong ranks slightly higher than the Holocaust, 9/11 and slavery. Basically, this movie apparently has no redeeming features whatsoever. De Laurentis' decision to build a 40 foot robot Kong that was virtually unusable; the fact that Kong was mainly played by a man in a suit; the contemporary setting; the absence of dinosaur battles; the climax on top of the World Trade Centre; Jessica Lange's character's stupid name (what in the blue buggery is a Dwan, anyway?); if Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Jack the Ripper, Hitler and Satan formed a gang and started burning down orphanages, they wouldn't receive the same level of criticism.Personally, I have something of a soft spot for this movie, and consider it to be extremely underrated. Much like the 1998 U.S Godzilla, it's not as good as the original, but it's still a decent film. I suppose the reason I like it is because, like Godzilla, I saw the remake before the original, and as such I didn't have any preconceptions about what I should see; I wasn't expecting fights with dinosaurs, and so I wasn't disappointed when I didn't see them.I suppose what people dislike about this film is that, unlike Peter Jackson's 2005 version, which is a faithful retelling of the 1933 King Kong, Kong 76 bears little resemblance to the original. It's set in 1976 and has a whole new set of characters who, it has to be said, aren't great. Charles Grodin's Fred Wilson is annoying and it's a relief to see him get splattered by Kong at the end. Jeff Bridges does better as Jack Prescott, but he's still fairly forgettable, and Jessica Lange just doesn't engage the viewer like Fay Wray. Fortunately, these three actors emerged unscathed and went on to have successful careers, unlike director John Guillermin, who ended up having to make the unnecessary sequel, King Kong Lives, which was seen by about three people. The contemporary setting just doesn't lend itself to the fantastical story, and having a petrochemical company at the heart of proceedings feels like the producers were trying to hard to be modern. Also, having Kong in a cage wearing a crown with the company logo on it just looks moronic.The most vociferous criticism has been directed at the film's special effects which, given that they were done by Carlo Rambaldi and Rick Baker, ought to have been something really special, or at least better than those of a movie that even back in 1976 was over forty years old. To be fair, Rick Baker's Kong suit is a lot better than most gorilla suits seen in movies (see King Kong Escapes, APE and The Mighty Gorga for example of how bad these things can be) and at least he tried to make it look like a real gorilla, wearing contact lenses that looked like a gorilla's eyes and basing the muscle structure on real apes. The real problem is Rambaldi's 40 foot robot Kong; while this creation had tremendous publicity value (no one could ever accuse Dino De Laurentis of being understated) when it came time to actually use the thing, it was obvious that having a 40 foot tall robot that needed to be operated by an army of technicians rampaging around New York and climbing the World Trade Centre was ever so slightly unfeasible, and so the robot only appears in a couple of scenes, mainly where Kong is standing still. The only time the thing moves is when it lifts one arm and then it just looks like a big, unconvincing robot.In spite of these criticisms, King Kong 1976 does have some good points, notably his NYC rampage and the finale still makes you feel sorry for the big ape, particularly the close-ups of machine gun fire hitting him. The scene where Dwan punches Kong on the nose is amusing and may have inspired Naomi Watts' feistier heroine in the 2005 version, and, in a strange way, making Kong look so stupid in that crown and cage actually increases viewer sympathy for him. Basically, this movie is not the Antichrist of cinema, and if you're in the mood for some big gorilla action, it's definitely worthy of your time, provided you don't expect a shot-for-shot reworking of the original.",King Kong
143,DwightLynn,Disappointing,4,23 April 2020,"As a kid, the original King Kong from 1933 meant everything to me. I watched it as often as I could and was put in a trance every time I did. I was mesmerized by the world, the characters, and the insane adventure of it all. When my dad mentioned that there was a remake, 5-year-old-me was so excited to check it out. ""A remake! Well, gee, I bet there's even more dinosaurs and even more action! I bet it's a million times better than the original!"" So, I put it in my VCR, gave it a watch, and well...let's just say 5-yr-old-me was not amused. There weren't many action scenes, there was way too much talking, and there weren't even any dinosaurs! It failed all criteria that my younger self used to judge movies.Looking back as an adult, I obviously judge movies differently. I tend to welcome movies with lots of dialogue and acknowledge that not every movie has to be filled with action, adventure, and dinosaurs (although I'm not one to complain if they do). However, even with my new outlook on judging movies, I would still consider the 1976 King Kong to be a failed remake. Put simply, it lacks the imagination and magic of the original, and it fails to keep me engaged with its meandering pace and cumbersome runtime.I think the biggest thing wrong with the 1976 film is its characters. Many of them are drastically different from their 1933 counterparts: Jack is now a hippy, Ann is a failed actress from the start (and is also called Dwan), and Carl Denham is now much more of an egotist (and is now called Fred). These changes actually aren't bad on a conceptual level; I think playing around with the identities of the characters is a smart way to differentiate this film from the original, but unfortunately, many of the characters are significantly less interesting. It's strange, but the characters from 1933 are way more complex, three-dimensional, and endearing than these ""modern"" characters, which isn't a good sign. I love the original film, in fact I would still call it my favorite movie even after all these years, but even I know it hasn't aged perfectly. Updating the characters seems like it would be an easy thing to do, but this film surprisingly drops the ball.Every character in the 1976 film just seems so...ditzy. Most of them don't seem to care for others and they spend most of their time either lusting over Dwan or yelling at each other. They're so unlikable to watch, you end up rooting for Kong more than anyone else. Which is a pretty big problem since Kong really has nothing to do in this version besides walk around his empty, boring island.The original island from 1933 was populated by some of the most bizarre creatures ever seen on film. Every scene brought new challenges for the crew as they tried their best to find Ann, and the tension escalated with every new threat they faced. Here, the island is completely barren; there's no dinosaurs, no weird creatures. There's nothing but a giant snake which shows up for maybe 30 seconds.We don't know how far away the sailors are in relation to Kong, so we don't feel like our characters are being challenged in any way. There's no escalation of events, no excitement. If the film would rather focus on dialogue and character dynamics, that'd be fine, but the characters are too one dimensional to care about. The original film brought something new to every scene, usually a unique creature brought to life with some really impressive special effects. Here, there are no notable special effects. There are no creatures, there is no life to this movie. Everything looks way too dreary and there's nothing to keep you interested. The only interesting thing about the movie is Kong himself, but even that aspect of the film is clumsy.Kong in this version is humanized compared to before. Here we see that Kong genuinely likes Dwan; he thinks of her as his mate, which is just as creepy and awkward as it sounds. I'm not opposed to the idea of giving more attention to the love story between Kong and Dwan, but it never ceases to be awkward. There's constant scenes of Kong showering Dwan, Kong smiling creepily, and Kong trying to take off her clothes. It's weird, unnatural, and makes me wonder what was going through the disturbed minds of the filmmakers. Is this what they thought the original film needed? This is the best they could come up with when considering things to update?Yes, there is a scene in the original film when Kong removes some of Ann's clothing, but the difference is that Kong from 1933 was just a mindless animal. He lacked self-awareness, and so his attraction to Ann was largely innocent. The 1976 Kong is just a weird pervert, like if Harvey Weinstein decided to dress in a gorilla costume. The idea of giving Kong more sentience is interesting, but it also takes away from the tragedy of the story. Kong being an animal in the original is part of what made it so sad: Kong was thrown into a world he didn't understand and was killed trying to protect a woman who, unbeknownst to him, didn't think of him as anything more than a monster. That is extremely sad, and I'd argue more sad than Kong willingly sacrificing himself to protect Dwan.It's interesting to me that people bash the 2005 film so hard, despite it accomplishing better most of what this film sets out to do. It humanizes Kong in a more intelligent way, it establishes a bond between Kong and Ann in a less ridiculous fashion, and despite being an hour longer, Peter Jackson's movie also moves along quicker. More than anything, Peter Jackson understood the one thing that makes King Kong so good: escapism.That's not to say this film is awful all around. For one, it is very effective at building atmosphere, largely thanks to John Berry's amazing musical score. This is one of my favorite soundtracks ever with so many memorable tracks, and it really does a lot to elevate the lackluster material. Another positive is that the opening act has some great build-up: there's an amazing scene where Jack is reading out of a book describing the cursed nature of the island that the ship's heading towards. John Berry's excellent score comes in and produces a scene filled with dread and sets a truly foreboding mood. The entire build up to Kong in general is really well set-up. Unlike the 2005 remake, they don't spend an abhorrent amount of time on the boat. The natives of the island are much more hostile and mysterious than the original film, and their wall showcases some really impressive production design. It's only after the titular character shows up that the film's momentum drops like a rock.I wish I could like this film as much as the original, but it just wasn't meant to be. The characters are annoying, the pacing is ungodly slow for a story that is built to be exciting. And it's inferior in every way to the original in terms of both technicals and story. This is a film that both I and my younger self can agree is painfully mediocre. I don't know how you could make a movie about a giant gorilla boring, but they succeeded.",King Kong
144,Tom-91,My very first movie .......,7,18 July 2007,"This is the very first film my father ever took me to see ..... along with ""Star Wars"" a few years later, it is very vivid in my mind.Of the three versions of 'Kong', I think it is clearly the worst, but I don't think it is as bad as people make it out to be. The effects are the weakness of the film. While it was much simpler to film stationary space ships in front of blue screen, this film proved just how impossible it was to make something organic too believable without relying on miniatures that, while pretty good, were still miniatures.Aside from the acting of Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, which were pretty good, I thought that the concept of moving the action to the modern day was pretty good ... and at the same time made a statement about the times of the mid-1970s.In the era of disco and drugs, a loss of faith in leaders and an ""anything goes"" attitude, this film seemed to show a chink in that armor. Having recently seen this film again (along with the Peter Jackson version), I was taken that in the end Prescot wanted to pull her away (just like Driscol in the Jackson version), but in the end, when she is heart broken over Kong's death, Driscol goes to her and comforts her. Prescot consciously does not, as she is surrounded by cameras and the fame she so desperately wanted. I took this as a demonstration of the old saying ""never ask for what you want, because you might just get it."" In an era where everyone was out for their fifteen minutes, this film showed (albeit in a sci-fi kind of way) the tragedy that can befall that quest.I would not rank it among the greatest action or fantasy films of all time ..... but I think it is an iconic 1970s film ..... when Hollywood thought they could go back to their past and make anything automatically better than before ..... but really couldn't.",King Kong
145,Showho,"A Benchmark For Cinema, & Dreammakers",10,23 March 2015,"King Kong '76 serves as a colossal benchmark in the evolution of cinematic special effects and a damn amazing one at that and I absolutely relished seeing this in theaters several times. Credit must be paid to the jaw dropping craftsmanship that went into creating Kong's huge automatronic arms and fingers which oh so dramatically pluck Jessica Lange from that Skull Mountain sacrificial alter. Rick Baker's masterful prosthetic Gorilla make-up is incredibly emotive, and took make up effects to new heights of brilliance. Of course the 'Environmental Rape By Petrox' and the obvious parallels with kidnapping Kong off his native habitat are still as powerful today, as during the psychedelic 70's. Acknowledgment must also be given to John Barry's haunting, brilliant orchestral score which is second to none. Finally, where would we be without the brilliant cast of characters, including Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin and a completely unknown Jessica Lange who manages a kick-ass performance and winds up one of America's most respected actors, Lest we not forget the tiny little detail that King Kong '76 also happened to be an enormous (if not critically lambasted) hit at the box office. Time has shown however, that the critical reaction was more in part to Dino DeLaurentiis's sheer audacious tenacity than the quality of the film itself. (That and the fact that he called Meryl Streep a pig in Italian, at her audition for the film. Not smart Dino.) In short, King Kong '76 has influenced myself and millions of other aspiring artists, actors, filmmakers and technicians more than I can say. Words seem inadequate. Between it and the never-to-be-topped 1933 original, these two are hands down the best of the bunch.",King Kong

147,sgraf_x,The next Kong movie should be a remake of this Kong movie,6,24 February 2019,"This version of King Kong had a lot going for it until the dreadful third act, it is a drastic departure from the rest of the film and If it had just maintained that momentum it would likely have been a classic. Something is very off with the film once it reaches New York and I am not sure if they replaced the director or the studio took over or they ran out of money or time. This whole portion of the film feels expedited and its like it was written by a completely different writer. Even the special effects, which were pretty good for 1976, took on a very cheesy b-movie look. The proportions of some things in the city like the train and the helicopters were way out of whack and its like they weren't even trying anymore. Also the marketing poster makes me think I am correct about this as you will never see that scene. Instead of planes by day you get helicopters by night and never have I seen such false advertising on a movie poster, not then and not now. Its a shame too because it had a lot going for it as the majority of the script was well written, the cast was really good, the spx were good and the cinematography was excellent but it just all collapsed in the final act. The other issue I have with it was Dwan's characterization, in todays world of empowered females this does not fly. She was overly sexualized in both dress and manner and the scene where Kong attempted to remove her top was unnecessary and cringe inducing. I think it would be cool to see a remake of this very movie where they could modernize that characterization, remove that scene, update the sfx, rectify the issues with the final act and finally give us that poster scene of planes by day.",King Kong

149,BMovieMogul,The Ultimate Insult,2,18 March 2005,"Wow... it's hard to say where to begin on this one. I think 'horrific' sums it up in one word. Why remake a classic of this caliber? Standing on it's own, it would've been a unintentionally silly camp film that I would've rated higher for general goofiness. Aside from the mediocre monkey suit and full size animatronic 'robot Kong' that gets mere seconds of screen time and more closely resembles a 50 foot tall shag carpet, I think the attempt to make it 'hip and modern' is what truly killed this picture.It's one and ONLY redeeming value is that you can tell Kong's designer Rick Baker was working his hardest against a completely inept producer and director. The facial features on his Kong are remarkably expressive, though the 'Bigfoot' design of the body (allegedly at the insistence of DeLaurentis) doesn't work well at all.I could see hints of acting talent in Jessica Lange that would shine through in later films, as she worked her way through the insipid script. There is really and truly a talented cast in there, but they had nothing to work with.I'd only recommend this picture to those who can't imagine how truly horrible a remake of a classic can be.",King Kong
150,pbubny-1,Better than it's given credit for,6,11 December 2005,"I know, I know--anything from the '70s that didn't star Jack Nicholson or wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese is suspect these days, and if you're talking about a heavily-hyped remake of an indisputable classic, the urge to take potshots is irresistible. But despite the dated special effects and elements of camp, the movie does not fall on its face into a Kong footprint. The doomed love that the giant beast felt for the beauty (who, in the person of Jessica Lange, is a stunner) is well-delineated, there's actual excitement and suspense, and the allusions to the rape of the environment by ""civilization"" are not amiss here. Moreover, the movie's intended humor really is funny. And John Barry's score has stayed with me all these years, although the same basic sound recurred in his music for ""Out of Africa"" and ""Dances with Wolves."" For anyone who was in New York on 9/11, there's an inadvertent poignancy in this movie's concluding scenes at the Twin Towers. I'm sure that within a few weeks of posting this, I will have seen Peter Jackson's new version, which updates the effects with CGI technology yet returns the story to the 1930s.

For '76 I'd say it was quite an achievement. Lange is great in it (and quite stunningly beautiful) and Bridges always rules. Can't go wrong with this version... don't believe the negative hype. I, for one, appreciate it when someone does a remake and actually interprets the story differently. Carpenter did it with The Thing and Cronenberg did it with the fly and both were amazing. I think this movies gets more negative comments because they are comparing it to the original, which back in its day was the first movie of its kind (Mighty Joe Young is still better!). For movie purists, the thought of remaking a landmark film is always touchy territory. Thus, they rip the remake. The core story is still basically the same, the writers just updated key elements that were pivotal 'classic' moments from the original (empire state building for one). Again the purists cry foul. Bottomline, see it and give it a chance... ignore the pompous so called ""experts"".",King Kong

154,xtopperx,A great movie!,10,16 November 2005,"This movie deserves a 10. I have serious doubts that Peter Jackson will tell a Kong story as well as John Guillermin did. If a friend had never seen a Kong movie; I'd tell them to see this one. Why? Because once you've seen one Kong movie, then you'll know what's coming in the other ones. This movie has spirit in surplus. It's charming, action packed, beautiful, thought provoking, and heart poundingly scary at all the right moments. Logistically, it accomplishes many production benchmarks that most filmmakers only dream of; such as acting proficiency, cinematography, dramatic timing, locations, scoring, direction, script, story-telling and good budget. John Guillermin weaves all those elements together to produce a movie that will captivate you, if you let it. It's a movie so rife with differing symbolism, that you won't be able to keep it all straight. And though Guillermin did not invent the basic story, he successfully presents us with the complexity of it; which is the greatest aspiration of every movie. Complexity like: 1. The role reversal of man and pet, where the animal becomes the master. (Including where the master's relationship turns unhealthy) 2. The need that many creatures (including humans) have to be loved by people.3. Ironically, it's the sexy Dwan who teaches us that instead of indulging one's lust, that sympathy, respect and a friend with a positive attitude is what people actually need.4. The evil that results from humanity's inclination to exploit, and indulge our greed and self-centeredness.5. How man ought to strive for a noble management of his life and his surroundings, like the environment-conscious Jack Prescott.6. Kong and Jack share a resemblance. By the criteria of their own differing species, they are noble and innocent and both are victimized by the corruption of modern society.Excellent performances from all cast members. I've never seen a better performance from Charles Grodin; he's perfect in this movie. Jeff Bridges is as good here as he ever is. Jessica Lange is also spot-on as the air headed beauty that this story needs (For it's plausible that someone naive as Dwan could genuinely care for such a terrifying beast). You'll sympathize with all the main characters. And you join each of them as they strive to and approach their dreams; and except for Jack, they all achieve. But the actual glory is not what they'd hoped for; it's tainted bitter by a price. And Jack, pure of heart yet impotent, gets nothing but the trauma of watching events turn from bad to worse.Great film-making. The views, lighting, film grade, and overall production are top notch even by today's standards.",King Kong
155,pbp720-1,"Not really terrible, though the effects *do* stink",4,30 December 2005,"The movie, as a whole, isn't awful. Well OK, it's bad, but not unwatchably so. The effects are poor, though, notably the guy in the ape suit. At first I thought I was just spoiled by Peter Jackson's awesome CGI gorilla, but this '76 version doesn't even stand up to the original's ape (which is still effective to this day; heck, it doesn't even stand up to the fake gorilla in Trading Places). Which brings to mind the question of why this film couldn't have gotten the same stop-motion treatment as the original. It's likely the producers thought a guy in an ape suit (constantly gesticulating and ""roaring"") would be more convincing. One wonders, though, why Ray Harryhausen (who began his career in stop-motion as a result of the '33 film) couldn't be consulted; I guess he was busy with Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger at the time, but this film could have sorely used his talents.On another note, switching the Empire State Building with the World Trade Center simply doesn't work. The effect is not the same as that of a giant ape ascending a giant steepled tower. In fact, the whole thing comes across as lame. There is also the discomforting image of a helicopter hitting one of the towers, but the filmmakers can hardly be criticized for that.",King Kong

Maybe if I'd been born in the 50's or 60's, and grown up loving the original, then gotten all excited about a remake, only to have my hopes dashed by a mediocre product, I'd loathe this like everyone else does. But I was born in '76. By the time I got around to being able to actually comprehend movies, this was already on T.V. every Saturday afternoon. For me, there have always been two King Kongs. Yes, the black and white ape is more believable, and scarier looking, and more lovable, and inarguably the star of a better movie. But when you're 5 years old, a man in a monkey suit is just as realistic as a stop motion model, because suspension of disbelief is not just easy for you, it's a way of life. So go ahead, hate this movie if you want. To me, it's an old friend, and I won't abandon it.",King Kong
157,alexb-87881,Surprisingly Good for such Bad Reviews,6,31 December 2020,"Although I will never forgive them for making Kong climb the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building, I didn't hate this movie as much as I thought I would. Unlike the original, the reason they went to the island was to drill for oil instead of making a movie, and I think that that distracted from my interpretation of the original's theme that greed has a huge effect on others. Lorenzo Semple Jr's interpretation was clearly that wildlife shouldn't be interfered with, this theme was very surface level because the characters often stated that they though it was wrong how they were taking Kong captive.
Jessica Lange's performance was at times unconvincing, but I think the critics were being over dramatic when they said it was one of the worst performances by a future Oscar winner. Now I don't know why she played Dean as if she was in love with Kong, but it was distracting, and I think that had to do more with the writing than her acting.
Overall it was enjoyable and entertaining and despite the surface level themes and mediocre acting, it was enjoyable and worth watching.",King Kong

If you watch the movie, you will probably end up with eye strain as just about the entire film is shot in near total darkness.THE MOVIE IS TOO DARK!It's almost as though the cameraman had just found a sale on filters., and was testing them all out on the same project. Why bother to make a movie that is so difficult to see? Was it an effort to hide poor special effects? I suspect that is the case in many features that are shot using an abundance of filters.Otherwise, KING KONG (1976) might have been good, if one could have seen it.",King Kong
159,crakatoot,Don't Listen to the Critics. This is a Fun Remake....,8,12 March 2017,"Now its impossible to talk about this movie without talking the other ones. The original 1933 film, is of course a classic. A seminal film. But at its heart it is just trying to be a fun adventure movie. And that's what this film is trying to recapture, that adventurous spirit. But in a modern context. Well modern for the 70's anyway. And this film did that beautifully. The buildup, the stories about the island. That big ass wall. Of course we know what's behind the wall but it's still good build up. And come on seeing Kong climb the Twin Towers. That was pretty cool. Especially when he jumped from one to the other. And of all the Kong films, this one had the most brutal ending. Kong's death was surprisingly graphic. The 2005 King Kong, for all its melodrama was totally bloodless. Not this film though, it really drove home the tragedy. Still, this film kept a light tone. Again one of the biggest problems with the 2005 film was how heavy handed and maudlin the whole thing was. King Kong is a silly idea and the 70's film acknowledged that and had fun with it. Did it go a little to goofy at moments ""You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!"" oh yeah. And yes the Dwan character is supposed to be an air head. But come on, every character in every movie can't be a strong tough bad ass And I do think this film handled the Kong, girl relationship best. With Fay, she was just terrified of Kong. With Naomi they went way over board with their connection, Christ they went ice skating. But here, they had a good balance. Dwan was clearly scared of Kong but still she didn't want to see him get hurt. The film is not flawless of course, again some of it is a little too goofy. And of all the Kong films, this one does the least with Skull Island. We do get to see Kong fight a giant snake but that's about it. Don't listen to the critics though. This a terrific remake and a great 70's era disaster film. It has some good commentary about environmentalism. And Jessica Lange looked damn good. Especially in her short shorts.",King Kong
160,tmitch-1,"""King Kong"" and ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""",3,18 July 2005,"The 1976 version of ""King Kong"" and the very first (I think it was 1979) big-screen adaptation of ""Star Trek"" are two of the very first movies I can recall seeing in a movie theater. I think I was about eight when I saw ""King Kong"" and about ten when I saw ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" And I vividly remember sitting in the theater silently for several minutes after both films ended with my jaw open - unable to put into words the immensity of my disappointment. I couldn't even summon the strength to get up and leave until my mom prodded me several times.Although I knew I felt let down by both the ""King Kong"" remake and the first ""Star Trek"" movie, it wasn't until some years later that I realized just how similar my disappointment was in both cases.The 1933 release of ""King Kong"" and the 1960s ""Star Trek"" TV series were two of my all-time-favorite childhood entertainment staples. I loved both despite their flaws, and maybe even because of them. They had become like an old friends whom you learn to love all the more for all of their goofy quirks and frailties. The over-dramatic acting, cheesy special effects, and thunderously melodramatic music of both the original ""King Kong"" and the original ""Star Trek"" just made them all the more endearing. Like a good friend, they weren't perfect, but their hearts were always in the right place, and you never got tired of visiting them over and over again.So, when updated big-screen adaptations of ""King Kong"" and ""Star Trek"" came out, I of course assumed that I would love the new versions for the same reasons that I loved their predecessors, and that the only difference would be that the new offerings would be even better.And, boy, was I blown away. And not in a good way.In place of the lovable - if overly earnest - characters of the originals were either hollow, soulless shadows of their former selves (as in ""Star Trek""); or stupid, annoying, completely unlikable jerks (as in ""King Kong).Instead of the fast-paced and engagingly simple story lines of the originals, we got slow, uninteresting, and hopelessly convoluted story lines that no one could possibly care about - even if they could actually follow what was happening.And worst of all, I realized with rising dread as I sat through both movies that I just didn't like what these old friends had become. And not just in the sense that I didn't want to spend time with them anymore; I literally didn't like THEM. They used to be honest and forthright; now they were dodgy and self-delusional. There was a time when they never took themselves too seriously, and never passed on an opportunity to laugh at themselves; now they were self-important, arrogant, and took themselves deadly seriously. And where you once felt they were happiest when they made you happy; they now had become the center of their own universe, and seemed to believe that it was your job to revolve around them - no matter how boring and uninteresting they had become.Well, I gave my old friend ""Star Trek"" another chance, and apparently it was just an adolescent phase she was going through. She was back to her old self by the time ""The Wrath of Khan"" came out. Now she's getting up there in years, but she's still the same friend from my childhood. I don't always like spending time with her, but I always like her.After 29 years, I'm anxious to give another one of my childhood friends another chance. Thanks, Peter Jackson.",King Kong

Plus, (my biggest problem in this film) there are no dinosaurs! Dinosaurs are what made the other 2 movies so entertaining. The director of this piece of garbage removed the dinosaurs because ""they interfered with the love story"". Well, King Kong is not supposed to be a love story! It's an adventure story! Plus, the characters are very weak. Dwan was just a stupid ditz whose attitude got pretty annoying, and the other characters aren't even remotely interesting. Also, the effects stink!

The way that the movie built up to it's action, and dramatized parts is amazing. The acting was alright, but in a movie like that it doesn't matter.

168,jwmelvin-83959,"As Bad as They Say, but Jessica, you awesome!",3,16 June 2019,"When King Kong 1976 was released, the production company said that it was far better than the Japanese monster fare. This movie deals with a petrochemical company wanting to bring Kong to the main land from an island to be exploited for marketing purposes. The huge problem with this accurate summary of the plot is that this is also one of the plots of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla '62"". In 1976, we only saw that cruddy English dubbed version of K Vs. G. However, now it's easy to see the Japanese version of this movie, and discover that it is actually a parody. Comedy plays heavily into K Vs. G 1962. A pharmaceutical company wants to import Kong to Japan. It is played for giggles as much as anything, But with KK '76, a mean American petrochemical company wants to import Kong to America...no, wait...New Jersey? And we're taking this seriously? The movie does, to a 2 hour plus disaster of a film.From a contemporary view point, the stumbles for this film are stunning. Kong '33, 05, and Skull Island '17 succeed, often brilliantly with their subject. Kong '76 has a rather curious legacy. It's cast is headed by Charles Grodin (a really, really good actor), Jessica Lange (top 5 of her generation) and Jeff Bridges (most acclaimed of his generation) giving the worst performances of their careers, upstaged by the man in the ape suit, who is was played really well by Keny Long. Blame that on director John Guillermin.This was Jessica Lange's first movie, so she actually does deserve some credit. Her scenes with Kong are decent, and seems to lead as inspiration to Naomi Watt's character in Kong 05.But beware...Kong '76 is a product of the sexual revolution of the 1970's. It is dripping with hormones. Jack (Jeff Bridges) at one point says that this giant ape is turned on by Dean (Jessica Lange). On top of the mountain the ape starts to undress Dwan. That's a pretty good scene. A giant snake (freudian?) attacks Kong as Jack rescues Dwan, putting his shirt on her naked torso (more hormonal). They run, but in each other's arms watch Kong have a death battle with the reptile (even more hormonal). Kong wins, and they take off. It is insane with the sexual energy, and is a memorable scene. But not much else is.Now compare this to the train attack in the Japanese version of King Kong vs. Godzilla, where Bond girl Akiko Wakabayashi escapes Godzilla with the help of her boyfriend in a jeep. There is still this sense of sexual energy, yet of course the dragon has no eye for her. Indeed, she has to just keep from getting stepped on.Kong'05 takes this monster/damsel encounter too far, when Ann Darrow's spiritual connection to Kong implies bestiality a little too clearly.Curious how in Kong:Skull Island, when Mason (Brie Larson) has a clear connection to Kong, the big ape has no issue with boyfriend James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston). Tom is even able to put to words how amazingly beautiful yet dangerous nature can be, and how to leave it alone. There's a sense of truth in that. And we have our hormones excited, but under control.It's similar to how there is only goofy fantasy to a giant atomic breathed dragon. Yet, put in the terrors of Hiroshima on the innocent and technology out of control like Chernobyl, and this man in a rubber suit has a 65 years and counting international movie career.Back to the original subject, King Kong '76, the producers did not get the subject. Learn to love your monsters first. Don't put down the Japenese films until you get what they did well. Except for ""King Kong Escapes"". That is pretty bad.",King Kong

173,joejoemason,the real King Kong would smash the filmmakers,2,3 July 2013,"i always heard mixed opinions about this movie and now that I've seen it they should all be negative opinions. this movie in the first half hour seems like it might be decent, but from then on it goes down the toilet. i will give the filmmakers credit, they did try taking a different a different approach with the story so it didn't copy the original exactly but it ends up being a mediocre and uninspired story that if you took the king Kong part out of the movie then this film would just blend in with the crowd. the acting in the film isn't terrible, but nothing special and the characters themselves you don't really care for and you actually may hate some of them that were like able in the original film. as for the special effects, well they ain't so special. for the most part the special effects actually look pretty bad and for this time they could've been way better which is another reason this film doesn't need to be remembered. but lets not forget the big boy king Kong. in this film he basically is as expected the only character you care for. just to bad they went for a Japanese monster style and made him a guy in a rubber suit WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,this is king Kong not Godzilla you don't make him a guy in a rubber suit. overall they tried to modernize the story and it just doesn't work. this movie just shouldn't have been made and I'm sure the original king Kong hides in embarrassment from this god awful film, then of course they made a sequel to a bad film, that is all that needs to be said. my final words STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE AND IF YOU FIND IT ON DVD SMASH IT, MAKE THE REAL KING KONG PROUD!!!!",King Kong
174,kstevenson,King Kong by way of Godzilla,6,2 May 2003,"OK, here's my spoiler:It's a guy in a suit!  The movie is proof that unless he works for the IRS, there's nothing scary about a guy in a suit.All the same, I somehow like this movie. Charles Grodin is surprisingly good, and the Petrox oil survey pretext for visiting the island serves the story well, particularly considering when the movie was released (remember those gas lines?).  And while full body shots of the bipedal guy in the suit are laughable, the head shots are remarkably effective because Kong's eyes and lids are real and thereby, soulful. Here this version has the original beat. Oh, and Fay Wray has nothing on Jessica Lang.Lastly, the haunting score is marvelous.Consider this a guilty pleasure.",King Kong
175,patrickuws,Not as bad as you think.. and actually quite funny.,6,5 January 2001,I agree with one of the other comments.

176,alexmalden,Boredom,2,3 April 2006,"I thought this film in particular was boring. I like the king Kong movies this one however was boring and the special effects were horrible. I saw the beginning and liked it but i had to go somewhere so i couldn't finish it. I then saw it again this time the whole thing. I suffered through the movie. if you have seen other king Kong movies stick with them they are better than this one. The effects in this movie were really lame. They were about as bad as the old TV show ""land of the lost"". One main problem was there was to much romance in it. There was not as much in ""King Kong"" 1933 or in ""King Kong"" 2005. All i can say is that this film was not good especially for a king Kong film.",King Kong
177,dutcheemail,"Once again, a classic is ruined!!!",1,9 May 2006,"An idea of a remake of a movie as old as King Kong is not a bad idea, but don't destroy it! I loved the fact in the original that a motion picture company goes to skull island to photograph something that has never been seen before, but in this version, it is a fricken oil tanker, on quest for oil! Another insult to the original is the lame gorilla suit, instead of the iconic stop motion Kong, created by Willis O'Brien. There are no Dinosaurs like the original, and I remember Ann Darrow Bieng a cute classy women, not some kneel mouth bimbo! Another big mistake, is that they tried to Modernize it, you don't modernize a classic like King Kong! The one thing that really ticked me off was the fact that the end of the movie took place on the world trade center, and not the Empire State building! That was classic, and I loved that part, I cried, but I loved it. And they left out the famous line, ""It wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast."" Said by Carl Denham.

I was fairly uncritical and to me this seemed pretty good as a 'big event' film of the day. But I saw it at a matinée, and my abiding memory is of the climax in which Kong is shot to pieces, in glorious technicolor. Small children, their faces wet with tears and breaking their hearts, were carried out by their mums, having presumably gone to the cinema as a Christmas treat. Clearly the film's certification was incorrect.",King Kong

Then I read somewhere that he wasn't planning on having dinosaurs in his version. What? No dinosaurs? King Kong, without dinosaurs? Already, I had a sinking feeling about the movie, but when it came out, I was still looking forward to it. It didn't take me long to see that this version wasn't going to make me forget the original one. After the ground breaking special effects of bringing Kong to life in the original, we get a guy in a gorilla suit in this one. You have to be kidding me. No dinosaurs, a guy in a gorilla suit, cheesy special effects and bad acting. What a waste of time.",King Kong

181,zykcon,Multimillion Penny Dreadful,1,13 December 2005,"I just finished watching King Kong (1976) on AMC (American Movie Classics), which was shown head to head against the original King Kong on TMC (Turner Movie Channel), which also demonstrates the huge gap in the quality of the respective channels the high road vs. the lowest common thread.I've recently watched the original and thought I would give the 1976 version another go, the only other time I saw it, was when it was first released and I was in my late teens, and a King Kong mania struck NYC, there were even King Kong candy bars! To my surprise the film has gotten worse with time, but it was just as funny to watch this time as the first go around. This has to be one of the worst films of all time, and one of the worst remakes, and we now live in a time where many films are remakes of earlier works and most (studio) films are dreadful. The low budget British, man in a monkey suit, film Konga (1961) was a much more entertaining take on King Kong than this dreck! Even the Japanese versions where Kong takes on Godzilla (east Vs. west),and a giant robot King Kong were more fun. Here is a film that evokes absolutely no feelings for or from any of its characters. I think they really tried to be serious in this production, but it only turns out unwittingly comical, when Kong escapes his bonds and stomps on Charles Grodin all you can do is laugh. Every time Jeff Bridges (Who really is a fine actor) mugs a serious look at the camera, another laugh, and one of my favorite laughs take place on top of the WTC when Jessica Lange begs for Kong to hold her.I won't even go into how badly the film was constructed; high school students do a better job. The only reason to see this film is to help you appreciate the original that much more. Now Peter Jackson has turned Merrian C Cooper's creation in to his own, it seems to have a lot of CGI, which high school students are also very good at.",King Kong

I would certainly enjoy watching it again. I was surprised by the subtle humor and the acting was not bad. Jessica Lange is beautiful and the film itself is beautiful to watch. Kong's facial expressions were great! Sad to see the World Trade Center had such a prominent presence in the film. But who ever would've known what the future held in 1976.",King Kong

Well, King Kong is much more better.Of course, it is a remake of a legend (King Kong 1933) but the colour brings a lot and there is much more fun ... Of course, it is not an animation movie like the first one and in some scene a man was used for king kong ... But only the results only the result countsAdd a good musical score of John Barry, and marvellous actor like Jessica Lange (which i find better than Fay Wray) and Jeff Bridges who is perfect...The quality of the dvd zone 1 is good (image : 3/5 ; sound : 4/5) and allows us to appreciate the marvellous landscapes and a sublime musical score.A movie i recommend ...",King Kong
184,Frodo_The_Hutt,Enjoyably Awful,4,18 December 2006,"The 1976 version of King Kong is bad, really bad. With the exception of Charles Grodin's supper hammy performance there is nothing to entertain here. Jessica Lange is terrible in her first major role and Jeff Bridges acts like he believes the movie is good. Rick Baker's monkey suit fails as a special effect and the whole bizarre King Kong wants to rape Anne Darrow storyline does not work. In fact its creepy. The whole movie just doesn't wash. There are good ideas here, a lot of them pulled off in the 2005 Peter Jackson version. This is a movie to watch for laughs (there are a few) but this version is by far the weakest of the three. It wasn't beauty who killed this beast, it was boredom and bad acting.",King Kong

186,bishop-93,Man That Was Bad,1,10 October 2007,"Was it just me or was King Kong a man in a monkey suit? The overall plot was so stupid, we have people who want to drill for oil to take it take it back to New York. Hmm, it is pretty hard to drill for oil when you are riding in a tanker, and you have no equipment to do it with. The oil they did find was too fresh????? And the oil workers were morons, typical of Hollywood.The acting was horrible, every shot of Kong with Ann looked as if Kong was in a strip club watching his favorite dancer. The woman would not shut up, she screamed every moment with Kong, and was completely helpless when a dangerous situation can about. I also liked the fact that after Kong got shot; he collapsed on top of the world trade center, rolled off, fell all the way down, hit the bottom, and still was alive.Seriously, I do not like movies of hippies cheering at the deaths of our service members (which they did when Kong killed the men with the flame throwers). Save your time and watch the new King Kong.",King Kong
187,schiavone402,What was the director thinking?,7,21 January 2008,"I loved the movie, it scared the daylights out of me, but there were several things that bothered me. First, the whole politically correct 'greedy oil company bad guy vs young environmentalist long-haired hippie good guy' bothered me then and still bothers me now. Also, for as long as the movie was, there were scenes that were just kind of spliced together in a way that made no sense. When Kong comes across the band of sailors crossing the log bridge, he appeared out of nowhere. I mean, first he wasn't there and then a split second later, he was standing right on top of them, roaring at the top of his lungs! Finally, the 50' tall mechanical Kong used in the scene where he breaks out of his cage is absurd. It looks absolutely nothing like the man in the ape suit. For years, I thought it was supposed to actually be a mechanical Kong, but after I bought the DVD, I realized that the director wanted you to think that it was really Kong. Hey, otherwise, it was a fun movie. When I saw Kong brake through that wall on Skull Island on the big screen at the theater, my girlfriend and I nearly passed out! Good time!",King Kong
188,Eldorado66,A Classic Turkey,1,16 December 2009,"As I write this review we have 3 definitive King Kong movies.The best is of course the wonderful 1933 version which even today has stood the test of time. Then we have the 2005 Peter Jackson Kong which updated the story with spectacular special effects and a touching friendship between Ann and Kong. Finally we have this hilariously awful version. Where do I begin? How about the dialog which includes gems like 'get your hands off me you male chauvinist ape!'. Poor Jessica Lange made her film debut here,and its a testament to the actress's skill that she was able to overcome this embarrassing beginning and go on to have a fine career. Jeff Bridges is in full liberal hippie professor mode here,stowing away on the ship with a bribe then acting all holier than thou the rest of the journey and chastising scenery chewing Charles Grodin for being greedy. Then we have Kong,a ballyhooed special effect that consists of a man walking around in an ape suit on toy sets. Riveting. Could this movie be any worse? My advice is this,if you are drunk or high or maybe looking for a campy movie then give this a shot. If not then do yourselves a favor and steer clear of this bomb. I cant imagine any normal person with taste enjoying this.",King Kong
189,humo,Kong The Dreammaker,10,5 June 2006,"For me, This film is simply perfect. I haven't seen it in a while. I bet I watch it now and I will probably find plenty of errors or stuff that I would personally do different. But on the subjective level, this film is so brilliant that when I watched it for the very first time, I was like 3 or 4 years old and it blew me away back then. I felt so much for Kong that both my parents immediately saw the big impact this movie had in me. I became a fan of Kong. He was still alive in my head. I even remember I made a Kong myself using ceramic. He was like two and a half feet tall. I painted it brilliant black. He was a shining beast. Very cool for a five year old kid, you know. But Then it broke his right arm, and I believe my father threw it away. So I never saw it again. I was left with the memory I had of him in that film. I watched the Peter Jackson's remake on King Kong. It was really strong and very real. But for me, the one I will always remember goes to the 1976's version. With Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange. This film was so huge in my life that without any doubts, I can honestly admit that my desire of becoming a Film Director was born with King Kong, 1976. That's all I can say.",King Kong
190,blackkatbone,Sorry; it really is pretty bad,4,10 March 2017,"It's not a popular opinion, but this movie has all the bad effects of Wrath of the Titans and none of the charm.

192,DjangoStark,A disaster ...,4,9 August 2013,"This movie is a remake of the original movie (1933) and unfortunately it's a disaster ... The costume of Kong is shapely made for the time but you can't like Kong like you can appreciate him in the movie by Peter Jackson : he's looks like a villain and his perverse smiles to Duane are really frightening ! Moreover, the men who captured him, will say to Duane that the gorilla has tried to ... rape her ! This is really fishy ... For the end we wait to see Kong on the Empire State Building like in the original movie but it's another famous building of New York which is the place of the end. This movie is really bad : the heroin is stupid to the point to fall in the cage where Kong is locked, the hero has a big ugly beard and the dinosaurs are completely absent of the Skull Island (to replace them, we got a huge rubber snake). To finish I'll say that this movie shouldn't have to be produced because others films have followed and they are sadder.(Sorry for the faults I'm french)",King Kong
193,Kytescall,An underrated failure of a remake.,4,3 January 2006,"The popular label stamped on this film is that it is a failure. While this I agree, there are certain good points that are done better than the original.In the original classic, Ann Darrow, the damsel in distress, had no good feelings whatsoever for the unfortunate giant ape. Her function in the story was to be carried about by Kong, and, of course, scream. This remake, however, is more developed as a drama. Kong is treated more as a character, rather than a destroying machine that happens to have a certain bewildering attraction to blonds. Ann is also portrayed more as a character than a screaming doll, and she develops a liking for Kong that allows this film to become quite touching. And the eccentric who captures and brings Kong to the civilized world is appropriately portrayed as the scoundrel he should be.But the problem is, King Kong is not just any old love story. What is lacking in the remake is action. While the original Kong spent half the movie beating up an impressive collection of fanged agents of death, this film contains only one other monster, which, after a very brief and very boring struggle, never shows its rubber muppet-like self again. The quality of the effects is also very bad. Although the film is in colour, the effects are, in all practicality, inferior to that of the original, which was already over forty years old at the time. Another potential problem is that this film, on top of the lack of action, ended up a little too serious than need be. One element is that, what was a film-making expedition in the original was turned into a corporate-run oil expedition. While this is no problem in itself, it strays a little too far from the fact that King Kong is not expected to be anything more than entertainment. Personally, I feel that this message of how dangerous corporate society can be is a very good and important one, but in this movie it lacks the ominous subtlety I believe best fit for it (as in the earlier ""Alien"" movies, for example), and, as if aware of the fact that fans don't want a story too dark, this angle seems to be only half-heartedly pursued. The effect is that it comes out a little deliberate and cheesy.All in all, the good thing about this movie is that it puts emphasis on the drama. The bad thing is that that is all it pays attention to. It was a very good try, but to sum up the mistakes of this movie, while the drama of King Kong is what mostly makes it distinguishable from other monster flicks, this story is simply not allowed to be just a drama. The lord of all monster movies is, after all, a monster movie, and the makers appear to have forgotten that.",King Kong
194,joannemento,King Kong 1976,3,7 March 2005,"When this movie first came out I couldn't wait to see it. Boy, was I disappointed. As a person who adored the 1933 classic I couldn't believe the poor special effects. For most of the movie it was just a man in an ape suit. It was advertised at the time that they built a giant robotic ape that looked so real you wouldn't believe your eyes. Well it was so bad that they only used it for less than 3 minutes of movie time. When those scenes appear you can see how phony it looks and it doesn't even match the man in the ape suit. Check out the scene when he's back in New York and he's escaping from his chains. watch closely to see what I'm talking about. This movie was also too long. I can't understand how a movie made in 1933 can have better special effects than one made over 40 years later.",King Kong
195,Spinray,Kong's greatest defeat,1,1 May 2005,"This movie is a travesty...a putrid reinterpretation of one of the great movie classics. I saw King Kong(1933)for the first time on TV in the 1950's, and it is, without a doubt, the movie that made me love movies. I can think of few movies, like Kong '76, that I was more disappointed with. Though my tastes have changed...action/scifi/fantasy are no longer my cup of tea...I can think of no other movie I have seen as much and enjoyed more than I enjoy Kong (33). It remains one of the most mesmerizing, exciting, and thrilling movies I have ever seen. It's grand special effects, which, by the way, remain effective to this day, it's weird and wonderful score, and it terrific pacing has maybe been equaled but never top. I would only hope that Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange, two actors that I greatly admire, find this the embarrassment of their careers. It is little more than man-in-a-monkey-suit nonsense. (And Lange made the cover of Time (perhaps Newsweek) in the hand of Kong? Go figure.)

I have a fetish for anything Godzilla .. *cough* strange, I know. Anyway, this movie is hilarious. It is in no way comparable to the excellence of the original B&W Kong, but it's a funny movie on its own. The special effects are up to par with a Godzilla flick, which isn't saying much. The story's been changed slightly from the original, and not for the better.No longer do we have a movie maker venturing to an island with a beautiful unknown actress, but a greedy oil company owner and a girl he found on a raft in the ass end of nowhere .. yep. The acting is mediocre, but overall enhances the B-Movie feel.Kong's sexual interest (yes, strange I know) becomes quite clear when he removes Dawn's dress top. He blows her dry after bathing her in a waterfall, oh the romance! Oops, stop the drama cause he comes a monster reptile to do battle with Kong. Kong is awkward and too humanoid, but he sure can fight giant snakes! Where were the Dinosaurs?! We want Dinosaurs! Kong's trip to the big apple is the only real part of the movie that I don't look away from the screen and wonder where my life has gone, and that's not saying much either. There's an extremely funny part where Kong steps on a group of people, leaving them as a squiggling and screaming half smooshed pancake - Now that's entertainment! The Train attack is pretty comical too, where Kong mistakes a helpless woman for Dawn .. and disposes of her pretty quickly.Yep, it's a really lame B-Movie romp that's sure to give you some sort of entertainment, unless your movie tastes lean towards The Piano and Elephant (Both good films .. quite) 5 stars for retarded b-movie goodness.",King Kong
197,petercooper,Willfull Suspension of Disbelief,9,29 December 2005,"This film deserves it's props. It was great to see Kong in water and have him climb (almost brand new at the time) WTC. The only thing I did not like at all was the lack of fight scenes with Kong and other animals. Many people can't get the concept of ""WILLFULL SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF"". Also KING KONG LIVES with Linda Hamilton (1987) is worth a look because it deals with Kong in great depth. As for this one Jessica Lang is smoking and Charles Grodin is an annoying weasel as always. The acting could have been better, but Kongs fury is definitely felt. He sure was angry when he chucked the girl from the train after finding out it was not Lang.",King Kong

I used to be a massive Kong fan, then i saw this. The skull island set looks like someone spread a few rocks and trees around a completely barren hellhole. Jessica Lange was terrible as Dwan ( a really stupid name rather than a misspelling ) i mean, why the hell would you ask a thirty met-re high ape what star sign it is? And then the ape feels her up and by the end shes begging for it to be saved? Whats the go with that? I supposed it was the scriptwriters fault rather than Langes, the whole script is rubbish, rubbish rubbish. Its badly directed, badly acted and Kong looked far more realistic in the original. I don't understand why Dino De Laurentiis wanted to make this, it has dragged his name, Jessica Langes name and John Guillermans name through the mud for almost thirty year now - in fact, Lange managed to get up again and win two Oscars, so i suppose i shouldn't count her in this.

Jeff bridges does a decent job, although the effects are pretty cheesy. hey, before digital effects they needed to rely on creativity. the twin towers also add a pretty epic dimension to the film. it's worth checking out. i saw clips from peter Jackson's new version and it looks a bit over-produced and digital. the dinosaurs, creatures, etc don't look great.This movie is violent, too.

Director John Guillermin and Paramount recreate the dramatic and horrifying story of Kong the giant gorilla, that was first produced in 1933. Kong is once again terrorizing ""The Big Apple,"" but this time in color. Guillerman keeps the plot the same but with a twist. One of the many main characters, Fred Wilson leader of the expedition, finds himself searching for crude oil to hit it big with the ""Petrox"" company. Little does he know what awaits him on the thought to be uninhibited island. Actress Jessica Lange does a marvelous job portraying Dwan, the beautiful love of Kong. Paleontologist Jack Prescott tags along in search of something incredible never seen by a ""white"" man. Guillermin did not want to take away from the films basic storyline; he just wanted to add some new scenes and ideas. King Kong, for the time period, is shown with awesome special effects and outstanding camera shots. This film is truly a great work of art and a must see movie for all types of audiences.
