0,MartinHafer,An enjoyable guilty pleasure.,6,8 June 2018,"In some ways ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is a bad film. The dialog is occasionally goofy and the characters are mostly caricatures. But you come to expect that from producer Irwin Allen....as his shows and movies were all about spectacle and disaster and had little in the way of realistic human interactions. In these ways, his films are a bit like Cecil B. DeMille's.I just saw ""The Poseidon Adventure"" today. It was my second time--the first was in the theater when I was a boy. Both times I enjoyed it....but this time I could really see how cartoony many of the folks were in the film. There's the preacher (Gene Hackman)...a profane man who curses a lot and seems to have no faith in anything but himself. Then, there's the obese lady (Shelley Winters) and there are quite a few fat remarks at her expense in the film. And, there's the angry man (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-prostitute wife (Stella Stevens). There are more...all seemingly one-dimensional characters occupying this disaster-fest. But, oddly, despite itself the film IS entertaining and you won't be bored watching it. The special effects are amazing and the film satisfying if, at times, a bit silly.",The Poseidon Adventure
1,TheLittleSongbird,Stylish and entertaining disaster epic,8,1 June 2010,"There may be some implausibilities in the story, but The Poseidon Adventure is by far one of the better disaster movies I have seen.The special effects here are truly remarkable, as a matter of fact on a visual and technical level The Poseidon Adventure is flawless. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is crisp and the set pieces are lovingly-rendered. The direction is fine too, and the score is never overpowering but hugely effective and the script is intelligent.The acting is what makes the film though, special effects aside. Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Stella Stevens all give wonderfully poignant performances, but it is Gene Hackman who gives the best acting performance of the movie. Call me brash, but Hackman's performance could very well be the only component that is actually better than the special effects, if that was humanly possible, what I am saying is that Hackman is brilliant here. Overall, a very stylish and entertaining film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Poseidon Adventure
2,bkoganbing,Characters You Care About,9,22 February 2008,"The Poseidon Adventure has gotten its reputation as the best of all the disaster films of the seventies, not just for the Special Effects good as they are. It's that select group of people trying to survive, they're a bunch you do get to care about even though some of them can be annoying as all get out.The film is an adaption of Paul Gallico's novel which was written in the Thirties, but it was updated to the present for the film. While on the luxury liner Poseidon as a New Year's Eve Party goes on, Captain Leslie Nielsen takes note of an undersea earthquake and the tidal wave that will hit the ship in about fifteen minutes. But he's certainly not prepared for the wall of water that smacks the Poseidon broadside and capsizes it.Before the big event and the special effects that got The Poseidon Adventure its Oscar in that department we are introduced to the group of people who elect to try and climb up to the keel of the capsized Poseidon while the rest remain in the grand ballroom. Leading the group is minister Gene Hackman and the rest are married couples, Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens, musician/singer Carol Lynley, hypochondriac Red Buttons, steward Roddy McDowell, and teenager Pamela Sue Martin and her little brother Eric Shea.You do get wrapped up and sucked into the conflicts especially with Ernest Borgnine who's simultaneously got a war going with Gene Hackman and with his wife Stella Stevens. She's an ex-hooker who he busted several times and eventually married. He's got a rambunctious nature and Borgnine provides a lot of the interest here.Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters are the typical elderly Jewish couple who are on a trip to Israel to visit the grandchild they've never seen. They're a calming and steadying influence on the others. So is Red Buttons who finds courage he never thought he possessed and he helps Lynley out who's devastated at the loss of her brother who was in the band performing at the New Year's Eve Party.Gene Hackman as a minister takes his gospel from that noted skeptic Benjamin Franklin who said that God helps those who help themselves. For those who believe in a divine plan, he seems divinely sent to get these people to safety. Not all of them make it though.The Poseidon Adventure got another Oscar for Best Song for The Morning After. Maureen McGovern's recording of that tune was playing everywhere in 1972. It's one of the few Academy Award winning songs that is still prized and remembered over the last 40 years.Maybe Irwin Allen did a wise thing by not directing the film and letting Ronald Neame do it. Spectacle is great and I love it, but a good story with characters you care about is what makes the Poseidon Adventure the fine film it is.",The Poseidon Adventure
3,Leofwine_draca,Epic disaster flick,9,13 March 2012,"Irwin Allen was a man whose creativity was matched by few others. Not only was he responsible for some of the best TV science fiction during the 1960s – I'm talking LOST IN SPACE and LAND OF THE GIANTS – he also made my favourite disaster movie of all time, THE TOWERING INFERNO. Allen single-handled devised the short-lived boom in disaster movies during the 1970s, along with INFERNO and this. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is another classic, a simple yet epic movie detailing the efforts of a small band of survivors to escape from an upside-down, sinking cruise liner.The first thing that struck me as I sat down to watch this was the budget – or lack of. Many times, the director and creative team cut corners to disguise lack of funds – the climatic scene with the helicopter take-off is a rather poor piece of effects work, while exteriors of the stricken ship are limited to a few dodgy effects. Nevertheless, the lower budget actually works in this film's favour, as we end up sticking closely to the group of central characters, never learning what's going on outside of their inner circle. This gives the film a claustrophobic feel that works well with the plotting. Essentially this is a straightforward action-adventure, detailing visceral survival against the odds as the dwindling survivors cope with explosions, rising water and rickety, destroyed scenery.There's plenty of tension between the group, particularly coming from Ernest Borgnine as the hard-headed complainer. Gene Hackman is the erstwhile hero, a preacher with a neat line in heroics, racking up another strong performance in his career. Character actors like Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall and Shelley Winters round out the rest of the cast, while Stella Stevens brings glamour as the ex-hooker wandering round in stupidly high heels. Along the way, members of the group learn lessons in humanity and life, others discover their inborn hero, and still yet others make huge sacrifices for the good of their fellows. The pacing never flags and excitement and danger are everywhere. While I don't think this quite reaches the heights of THE TOWERING INFERNO, it's nevertheless a classic for good reason – a film that hasn't dated one bit.",The Poseidon Adventure
4,SnoopyStyle,great disaster movie,8,17 December 2014,"The S.S. Poseidon is enroute from NYC to Athens to be scrapped. The owners force the captain (Leslie Nielsen) to sail at full speed while not taking on required ballasts. She is top heavy and at midnight New Year's Eve, a rogue wave flips the ship upside down. A group of passengers struggle to work their way through the sinking ship. Reverend Frank Scott (Gene Hackman) leads the group with the help of injured waiter Acres (Roddy McDowall). Detective Lieutenant Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his wife former hooker Linda (Stella Stevens), the elderly couple Belle Rosen (Shelley Winters) and Manny Rosen (Jack Albertson), Susan Shelby (Pamela Sue Martin) and her little brother Robin (Eric Shea), shy bachelor James Martin (Red Buttons) and the lounge singer Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley) face the dangerous maze for the faint hope of survival.The 70s became in love with the disaster genre. This is one of the best. Along with other greats like 'The Towering Inferno', they represent simple mindless thrills. The biggest requirement is for great actors in easy to define roles. The flipping of the ship is chalk full of action-stunt goodness. The guy falling onto the skylight is terrific. This movie has to be considered a fan favorite of the genre.",The Poseidon Adventure
5,Hitchcoc,Shelley Winters Swims,7,30 November 2016,"This is a decent enough movie. It involves a huge ship that tips over in a typhoon and the stories that go from there. Some say it was the standard for disaster movies. It was really only one of many, and it actually came after some of the notable ones. This is again a collection of heroes, cowards, experts, rescue people, old people, young people, lovers, philanderers, and so on. All the stereotypes are there. It is an ensemble cast that includes some rather tiresome people. Some forgettable ones. Some bad actors. Some has beens. A couple of decent actors in other roles. I'm not meaning to dis this film because I rather enjoyed it. It's just that there was nothing all that new. When it was talked about in the day, they always mentioned that Shelley Winters swam under water. That was obviously a high point. Don't get it.",The Poseidon Adventure
6,mark.waltz,"Tidal Wave, Dead Ahead!",8,28 August 2014,"This is the ultimate disaster movie with a huge boat, a huge cast, a huge tidal wave, but most importantly, a huge heart. There have been lots of jokes in regards to the weight gain by Shelley Winters in the part she plays here, and until I first saw this, I had the impression that she played a stereotypical nagging Jewish wife. Wrong! Her character is the heart and soul of the film, a far cry from her clinging wife and mother in ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and her extremely abusive, racist mother in ""A Patch of Blue"".Several years before the success of ""The Love Boat"" on T.V., this all-star cast disaster epic was the big box office smash of its year, and seeing it 40+ years later, it is easy to understand why. The film is entertaining from start to finish: nail biting, sentimental, funny, and even tragic. There's no iceberg, torpedo or giant sea monster, just an act of God standing in the way of this ""Grand Hotel of the Sea"" getting to its destination.The actual tidal wave occurs fairly early in the film, leaving only enough time for character development and brief plot to establish what is going on in these people's lives at the time. Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters play an aging Jewish couple on their way to Israel to meet their grandson, while Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens play a trashy rich couple who do nothing but verbally spar, making them a modern version of ""Dinner at Eight's"" Wallace Beery and Jean Harlow. Stevens gets in a few good potshots at both hubby Ernest and portly Shelley, rudely pushing her way in front of Winters to climb up the Christmas tree impromptly used as a ladder while shouting, ""I'm going first, before old fat-ass gets stuck."" Carol Lynley is a shy, mousy lounge singer, first heard singing the film's Oscar Winning song ""The Morning After"", made famous as a hit record by Maureen McGovern. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea are a young sister and brother traveling alone, while Gene Hackman is a rather embittered Reverend. Others aboard include Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons and Arthur O'Connell, but with too many subplots going on, a few of the stars had to suffer in the final print. There's a bit of camp with the casting of a pre-""Airplane!"" Leslie Nielsen as the ship's captain who is deadly serious here without being called Shirley.The world of an upside down ship is a scary one, especially when surrounded by thousand miles of ocean and no realistic way to get to the top to summon help which may not be forthcoming. The human drama and suspense of being trapped in an enclosed space make for riveting storytelling. There are some shocking fatalities, and several of them are ""time to reach out for a Kleenex"" moments. The rapport between Hackman and Winters grows as the desperation increases, making for a touching relationship between strangers. Winters was a good sport about this film, and later in her life, poo-pooed the 1997 ""Titanic"" by publicly declaring, ""I prefer 'The Poseidon Adventure'"".Having become a perennial favorite for midnight showings on New Year's Eve and private viewings of the film's cult fans, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has survived a wretched sequel and an unnecessary remake. The film spawned tons of imitators and a series of disaster films that for the most part pale in comparison. If you are to see only one disaster movie in your life, it should be this one. Skip towering infernos, exploding blimps, big buses and tampered with rollercoasters. The adventure starts here, and Poseidon's name is stamped all over it.",The Poseidon Adventure
7,kosmasp,Pro-Active,8,6 May 2007,"You got to start off with the cast on this movie. It's incredible, everyone in here is in excellent form. They're so good, you don't even think about stereotypes in disaster movies. Of course people have made fun of this type of films, but even the more sarcastic ones have to admit, that this movie is damn good! The movie is about a boat on a cruise and of course something bad will happen. And although the visual effects here aren't as good as in the remake (my comment on that under the remake IMDb page), but that doesn't affect the suspense. If you've watched the remake, you'll appreciate this movie much more. Extra-ordinary drama packed in a thriller disaster movie. What else do you need?",The Poseidon Adventure
8,lee_eisenberg,This movie belongs at the bottom of the ocean!,3,21 October 2005,"Those disaster flicks of the '70s wouldn't have been so dull (maybe not at all) if they'd only had the disaster part. Unfortunately, they always felt tempted to show how it was affecting people's emotions. In ""The Poseidon Adventure"", a rogue wave hits an ocean liner, thereby capsizing it. With the ship completely inverted, a group of passengers races against the clock to find a way out. And a few people die along the way.I hate to have to say this, but this movie tries so hard to manipulate your emotions, that you kind of want everyone to die. What I can't figure is how Gene Hackman, usually one of Hollywood's most dependable actors, could go from his Oscar-winning role in ""The French Connection"" to this. For that matter, how could director Ronald Neame go from ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" to this? Wasting not only those two, but also the talents of Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Roddy McDowall, and Leslie Nielsen, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the ultimate example of a movie that you only watch as a reference. Thank God that ""Airplane!"" spoofed these kinds of movies.",The Poseidon Adventure
9,jboothmillard,The Poseidon Adventure,8,23 January 2006,"From director Ronald Neame (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), this is possibly one of, if not the most well known and well loved disaster movies of all time, up there with The Towering Inferno. Basically S.S. Poseidon is a cruise ship travelling from New York to Athens, and all the passengers are getting ready to celebrate the New Year. But then disaster strikes when a gigantic tidal wave hits the ship, killing Captain Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) and the bridge crew, and turning the ship upside down, with some passengers also being killed. The surviving passengers, led by Rev. Frank Scott (BAFTA winning Gene Hackman) decide to start climbing upwards to reach the engine room and the propeller shaft. While a few passengers stay behind and suffer their decision, the passengers climbing include Det. Lt. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and wife Linda (Stella Stevens), James Martin (Red Buttons), Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), Acres (Roddy McDowall), husband and wife Belle (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Shelley Winters) and Manny Rosen (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Jack Albertson), and brother and sister Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) and Robin Shelby (Eric Shea). As they climb they encounter explosions, passing other surviving passengers, water flooding in and upwards, and some of the group being killed by the continuing destruction, but in the end, six of the group are rescued. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""The Morning After"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and the Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. With a fantastic cast, Hackman of course standing out from the rest, and filled with all the tricks to keep you gripped, it is a highly watchable classic. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""The Morning After"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Gene Hackman was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",The Poseidon Adventure
10,Woodyanders,Riveting and exciting 70's disaster smash,9,17 October 2017,"A handful of people led by take-charge renegade priest Reverend Scott (an excellent performance by Gene Hackman) struggle to get out of a capsized ocean liner that they are trapped inside of before the ship eventually sinks.Director Ronald Neame keeps the gripping story moving along at a brisk pace, builds plenty of tension, maintains a tough tone throughout, and doesn't let the pyrotechnics overwhelm the intrinsic powerful drama in the desperate main situation. The meaty script by Wendell Mayes and Stirling fleshes out the principal characters nicely, doesn't pull any punches concerning the grim fates of certain people who one initially expects to make it, and even comes complete with a significant central message about the basic human desire to live and survive no matter what.Moreover, it's acted with tremendous aplomb by a tip-top cast: Ernest Borgnine as belligerent detective Rogo, Red Buttons as happy-go-lucky bachelor Martin, Carol Lynley as fragile pop singer Nonnie, Stella Stevens as Rogo's brash ex-hooker wife Linda, Shelley Winters as the good-hearted Belle Rosen, Jack Albertson as her gentle husband Manny, Pamela Sue Martin as spunky teenager Susan, Eric Shea as precious kid Robin, Roddy McDowall as helpful steward Acres, and Leslie Nielsen as the no-nonsense captain. The use of convincing practical effects adds a strong element of gritty realism, with the real flames and water conveying a potent and palpable sense of genuine danger. Kudos are also in order for Howard E. Stine's crisp widescreen cinematography and the lush and majestic orchestral score by John Williams. Worthy of its classic status.",The Poseidon Adventure
11,rmax304823,"Full Fathom Five, or Just About.",6,27 August 2009,"What a magnificent effort this represents. The writers must have scoured the cinematic archives, the musty libraries of modern and ancient literature, the brains of innumerable fourth-rate dramatists, in order to come up with this compendium of clichés. My hat is off to them. It's a disaster film of Biblical proportions in every respect. A stupendous cast, a colossal set of sets -- every one of them a hull and not a one of them a null. What a human drama! Love, conflict, pity and stupidity. Yes, the mind boggles. What the hell else is it supposed to do -- a toe dance to the Nutcracker Suite? The S.S. Poseidon, a passenger liner, is capsized by a giant tidal wave and floats upside down long enough for a handful of survivors led by the brutally pragmatic Reverend Gene Hackman to find their way upwards -- that is, to the bottom of the ship's hull -- and be rescued by helicopter. They're a diverse group, those passengers, with one of the couples (Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens) straight out of ""Dinner at Eight"", or was it ""Grand Hotel"" or ""Weekend at the Waldorf""? Alas, some of the initial survivors don't survive the trip. First, Roddy MacDowell drops down a water-filled funnel and that kills him. Why it kills him isn't immediately clear because when Borgnine jumps in to save him, Borgnine emerges in the same shape as when he went in.But let's not dwell on too many of the plot holes because it would deflect our attention from the plot per se. What I mean is -- we'd have to start at the very beginning. A big earthquake, for instance, does not produce a big slow wave at sea. It creates a shock of energy that travels through the water at a couple of hundred miles per hour causing only a slight swell at any given point. (It can get a LOT bigger when it reaches shore.) Then, when Captain Leslie Nielsen spots the fictitious monster wave approaching, he just talks it over with the crew, until the ship takes it on the port bow. There's not a heck of a lot you can do with a huge wave, even a phantasmic one, but at least you can try to minimize the damage by receiving it head on. Enough to make you wonder if the skipper was on mushrooms as, evidently, the writers were.I don't want to get too far off the track here but since we're at the beginning, I have to give an example of what I meant by saying this was ridden with clichés. There is a sharp exchange before the wave is sighted. The Captain wants to proceed at normal speed but the owner of the line wants to break a record or something and demands full speed ahead. Captain Nielsen finally caves and orders portentously, ""Full speed."" The decision is treated as an omen of ill tidings. But the fact is that the speed of the Poseidon has NOTHING at all to do with what follows. (If anything, it would have increased the ship's maneuverability.) But since it's a reliable cliché, lifted bodily from the many stories of the Titanic, it's shoe horned into the story.Hackman is, as I said, the group's leader but the group can't seem to understand the simple fact that the ship is upside down, and the hull is down by the head. That means, if they want to get up to a rescue point, they have to head towards the ship's propellers. Oh, there's a lot of conflict and shouting over that point. It has Gene Hackman tearing out his hair, one of the things that may account for his balding in later movies.Well, I'm making too much fun of it. There are two very nice features. One is seeing the ordinary fixtures of a passenger liner upside down. The urinals are on the ceiling and look a little daunting. The gas burners on the galley ranges are flaming away on the overhead, or underhead. Curious stuff.The second virtue is seeing Stella Stevens in her scanty underwear, and Pamela Sue Martin and Carol Lynley in short shorts. In a well-conceived and, I thought, extremely artistic scene, Stevens swims underwater with her man's shirt billowing up around her shoulders. And the director, Ronald Neame, gives us lengthy, thoughtful, rather philosophical shots from below of the other two babes climbing several ladders. Some very nice touches here, Mr. Neame.It's a piece of Hollywood junk but it preceded many others and it takes place at sea, so we'll give it a bonus point for originality. Reminded me of the time I was on a ship wallowing gently at a Pacific weather station when it suddenly took a sharp roll of about 40 degrees and sent all the crew and equipment tumbling up against the bulkhead. We all laughed and untangled ourselves. At my current age, if that happened again they would find my lifeless body at the bottom of the pile. Overall, it's mindless and entertaining.",The Poseidon Adventure
12,Tweekums,A classic disaster movie,9,18 July 2019,"From the start there is no doubt about what is going to happen; we are told that The Poseidon will meet disaster and only a few of those on board will survive... the question is who and how. In the opening scenes we are introduced to various key characters; Rev Scott, a priest who believes that God helps those who help themselves; Mike Rogo, a New York cop, and his wife Linda; Belle and Manny Rosen, a couple going to see their grandson; teenager Susan and younger brother Robin, who are travelling alone; Singer Nonnie Parry and some crew members.Then as everybody celebrates New Year's Eve there is an earthquake of Crete which causes a massive Tsunami. When it strikes the ship quickly turns turtle, killing many people. Survivors in the dining room are advised by the ship's purser to stay where they are and wait for rescue; Rev Scott believes that to survive they must head upwards to the engine room; now the highest point in the ship, also the location where the hull is thinnest. He is joined by the people we were introduced to earlier and as they proceed they meet various difficulties which not all of them will survive.The seventies are the decade associated with disaster movies and this is one of the best know examples. The genre may have got stale fairly quickly but this film still feels surprisingly fresh. The opening introductions don't go on too long but still manages to tell us enough about each of the key characters. The disaster itself is impressively shot with great special effects that make the viewer believe the characters really are in an inverted ship. The various problems they encounter keep things very tense and lead to some poignant moments. The way the characters argue about the best course of action feels realistic... although the precocious boy who seems to know everything about the ship is more than a little annoying at times. The cast does an impressive job and includes many famous actors; most notably Gene Hackman as Scott and Ernest Borgnine as Mike Rogo. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of the disaster genre but it is also worth watching if you like a good tense drama.",The Poseidon Adventure

14,BA_Harrison,Hotpants!,10,26 April 2018,"Top-heavy cruise ship The Poseidon is on its final voyage when it is hit by a freak wave that turns the vessel upside-down. A handful of survivors try to make their way to the 'top' of the topsy-turvy boat before rising waters cause it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.In the battle for best disaster movie of the '70s, top contenders The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure are fairly evenly matched: both are based on best-selling novels; both have big budgets and excellent special effects; both have an all-star cast; both boast scores by John Williams; both deliver in terms of nail-biting tension and excitement; and both end with an inordinate amount of luck and happenstance for the remaining survivors. So when choosing a favourite out of the two, it all boils down to one thing as far as I am concerned: hotpants!I don't seem to recall there being too many pairs of hotpants in The Towering Inferno (no jokes about characters' trousers on fire please); The Poseidon Adventure, on the other hand, features two pairs, as worn by brunette hottie Pamela Sue Martin and blonde babe Carol Lynley (who pairs her shorts with knee-high leather boots). With both actresses regularly called upon to climb up things (and to get thoroughly soaked), this small detail clinches it for Poseidon.Throw in Stella Stevens in her panties (and Shelley Winters for those who like 'em older and much fuller of figure) and that's men of most tastes catered for. The ladies of the audience aren't so lucky - they get Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowall and Ernest Borgnine - great actors but hardly hunks.9.5/10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb.",The Poseidon Adventure

Terrifically-charged and designed disaster epic from producer Irwin Allen has an ocean-liner overturning in a tidal wave, sending the passengers scrambling for safety. The writing has some campy elements, but also many intentional laughs (most belonging to Stella Stevens as a shrewish harpy). The cast is uniformly excellent, and it's especially nice to see Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson together (in any other movie they would seem like a mismatch, but in these roles they are just right). Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine battle each other for leadership, Carol Lynley is an appropriately terrified pop singer (when I saw this in the theater, the audience seemed highly in favor of Lynley getting left behind!), Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea are the kids.

There were only a handful of survivors. This is their story"" introduces this magnum opus from Irwin Allen. The fantastical science-fiction TV series producer rode a wave through the 1970s, until ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" finally sank as the decade closed. It was a great ride...""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the grand-daddy of the newly christened ""disaster film"" genre, and one of the best. From his space adventure TV programs, Mr. Allen gets Johnny Williams to compose a thrillingly appropriate soundtrack. A veteran of ""Lost in Space"" and future ""Star Wars"" traveler, Mr. Williams always scores. A cast of familiar faces, and three sets of shapely female legs, contribute memorably for Mr. Allen and director Ronald Neame... Amid the shipwreck, plus-sized Shelley Winters (as Belle Rosen) literally defines what a ""Best Supporting Actress"" characterization does for a film. The special effects still look terrific.

18,Coventry,"Follow the preacher, preacher; follow the preacher!",8,28 August 2016,"I love – and I truly mean LOVE – those typically bombastic and ginormous-scaled disaster movies from the 70s and early 80s, but admittedly they are all exactly the same The setting and type of catastrophe are always different, of course, but the narrative structure, cast of characters and action sequences are practically always alike! When all hell breaks loose, there's always one atypical hero who stands up and mobilizes a small group of reluctant followers to do the exact opposite of what seems logical and of what everybody else is doing. The group exists of stereotypes that complain the entire time about the decisions that are being made, and several of them obviously don't make it until the end of the movie, but eventually the hero's choices naturally turn out to be only slim chances for survival they ever had! Of course, being released in 1972, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was one of the very first big-budgeted disaster movies and one of the first enormous successes of producer Irwin Allen, so it's only logical that it spawned many imitations and that the formula blatantly got copied by Mr. Allen himself. Nearly 45 years later, the film is still very exciting, the sets & stunts still look very convincing (without any computer generated effects) and it's also still extremely realistic when it comes to illustrating what happens when blind panic breaks out. For all passengers and crew members aboard the SS Poseidon, the New Year couldn't possibly start off any worse Caught in an immense storm, the luxurious cruise ship gets hits by a massive tidal wave and capsizes, only moments after midnight on the 1st of January. With the captain and most of the crew members dead, the slightly controversial but authoritarian reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) profiles himself as the leader and rescuer of as many people as possible. He guides a small group towards the bottom of the ship – since it's upside down – but since they were celebrating the New Year in the restaurant on the deck, they have to climb huge Christmas trees and squirm through narrow ventilation shafts in order to reach the engine room. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is incredibly fast-paced, all the big names in the cast depict their roles very energetic and John Williams delivered a tremendously great score. The script contains a few horrible clichés in terms of character development (for example, dominant males and docile women) but luckily the multi-talented actors and actresses deal with it very well. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters and many others deliver stellar performances, and even Leslie Nielsen is memorable in his (too short) role as the amiable captain. Along with ""The Towering Inferno"" and the original ""Airport"", this is the most iconic disaster movie of the seventies!",The Poseidon Adventure

Floating in an inverted state in the sea, a hardy band of passengers led by Reverend Frank Scott, attempt to climb up to the engine room and hopefully to freedom. But inner fighting and a number of obstacles in their way are seriously hampering the survival bid.Producer Irwin Allen seemed to have single handedly created the disaster genre in the 1970s, here with The Poseidon Adventure, with Ronald Neame directing, he managed to take us into an upside down world of thrilling drama and none stop perils. The cast list may well be something to note, Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Roddy McDowell, Stella Stevens and Red Buttons, but really it's the sets and the fight for survival thru this watery labyrinthine that lifts the film above many of its genre peers. The picture has a very real feel to it, with the characters gradually getting you on side as they strive for survival, we have great work from Hackman and Borgnine as they vie for control of this disparate group, but we are with them all the way even tho we just know that this number will surely dwindle.The Poseidon Adventure 1972 was remade for the modern audience in 2006 with all the tools of the trade available to the makers, watching both films together it's not hard to see which is the most impressive, the 72 original has a vitality that modern blockbuster pictures can't quite grasp, and of course the technical aspects easily outstrip the CGI laden efforts of the later picture. Often seen as one of the leading lights of a much maligned genre, The Poseidon Adventure still packs a punch to this day, both in its craft and its emotional heart. 8/10",The Poseidon Adventure
22,Hey_Sweden,Don't make waves.,8,4 January 2017,"The so-called ""Master of Disaster"", Irwin Allen, was the genius behind this very early entry into that popular 1970s genre known as the all-star ""disaster film"". And ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an acceptable bit of escapism. Based on the novel by Paul Gallico, and scripted by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, it tells of a luxury cruise liner crossing the Atlantic on New Years' Eve. An underwater earthquake causes MASSIVE tidal waves to occur, including the one that causes the ship to capsize. It's up to a limited number of cast members to make it to the bottom (now the top) of the ship, and hopefully escape.As directed by Ronald Neame, who also guided ""Meteor"", a late entry into the genre, this is solidly entertaining, even with its flaws. Admittedly, the characters' introductory sequences ARE pretty bad, and there are too many of them here who are required to spend their time being annoying, or abrasive, or both. It does take a while for the film to grab a hold of its viewers, but once the wave hits, and the action kicks in (about a third of the way through), it becomes pretty watchable. Just don't spend too much time thinking about it, and it works fairly well.Kudos to production designer William J. Creber and cinematographer Harold E. Stine for creating a ""Hell on Earth"" vision for our survivors to endure. You're not always convinced you're seeing upside down sets, but you may be amused regardless. John Williams' music adds the right rousing touch.The cast is saddled with some bad dialogue and some characters who are ridiculous at times, but they do their best. Gene Hackman is the hero, an irreverent priest, and Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Red Buttons, Jack Albertson, Shelley Winters, Pamela Sue Martin, and Eric Shea play the imperiled passengers. Roddy McDowall and Leslie Nielsen are among the ships' crew. Nielsen, still a good eight years away from his career reinvention with ""Airplane!"", is solid as a rock as the too briefly seen captain.This is agreeable mindless entertainment that actually kills an hour and 57 minutes in a reasonably paced fashion. It can boast an Oscar winning song, in any event: ""The Morning After"".Followed by a sequel seven years later.Eight out of 10.",The Poseidon Adventure
23,preppy-3,One of the first disaster films and still one of the best.,8,4 July 2015,"On New Years Eve a huge wall of water capsizes an ocean liner turning it upside down. A small group of people survive and have to work their way up to the bottom of the ship to survive. There's the lead a progressive priest (Gene Hackman), the bickering couple (Stella Stevens and Ernest Borgnine), the lonely guy (Red Buttons), the equally lonely girl (Carol Lynley), a ship steward (Roddy McDowell), an elderly couple (Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson) and a young brother and sister (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). And, in a dramatic role, Leslie Nielsen as the Captain.The characters are predictable and the dialogue is terrible but it doesn't really matter. The boat capsizing happened fairly quick (30 minutes in) and then the action and adventure kicks in and there's never a let-up. The special effects are still impressive even by today's standards (the boat capsizing is VERY good). Also, despite the bad dialogue, the entire cast is excellent in their roles.

25,CinemaSerf,Never get on anything captained by Leslie Nielsen....,7,1 January 2021,"It's a toss up for me between this and ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974) as to which is my favourite disaster movie. This quite gripping drama sees an ageing ocean liner en-route to the scrap heap make one last, fateful, trip. As new year arrives, the ship is stuck by a gigantic tidal wave and capsizes. Carnage onboard ensues, with only a small band trapped in the ship's ballroom with the savvy to make for the part of the ship where the hull in thinnest - and the most likely spot for any external rescuers - before the ship goes the way of the ""Titanic""! Gene Hackman is great as the almost maniacal preacher who leads this rather motley band through the innards of the rapidly decaying vessel with plenty of perilous scenarios for them to navigate. The cast are generally good - Oscar nominated Shelley Winters is super, Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine, Roddy McDowall and Red Buttons all really help the encroaching sense of menace as their task becomes more dangerous. Regardless of their billing - they are all expendable too, and that adds loads to the richness - and plausibility - of this borderline claustrophobic story that certainly doesn't encourage cruising. The cinematography is tight (OK, so you know it is the camera and not the set that is moving!) and there are plenty of pyrotechnics, obstacle courses and deadly traps from ordinary staircases to keep the whole thing entertaining for a couple of hours and I - almost 50 years on - still find it a good watch.",The Poseidon Adventure
26,poolandrews,A 'Disasterpiece'.,7,19 September 2010,"The Poseidon Adventure is set aboard the cruise liner the S.S. Poseidon which is sailing from New York to Athens, it's New Year's Eve & a huge party is in full swing in the ball room. The Captain (Leslie Nielsen) is called to the bridge, an underground earthquake & aftershocks means a huge tidal wave is on a direct collision course with the Poseidon. The huge tidal wave hits the Poseidon at midnight just as it turns New Year, the Poseidon is capsized & ends up stranded upside down in the middle of the Ocean. With water gushing in & the inevitability that the Poseidon will sink a handful of passengers decide to head to the propeller shaft which is the only part of the Poseidon not underwater but they must face plenty of dangers & obstacles along the way...Directed by Ronald Neame this is the Grandfather of all those 70's people in peril disaster flicks that pitted unfortunates against Volcanos, Earthquakes, Meteors & Burning Buildings. Produced by the legendary Irwin Allen who apparently directed some of the action sequences The Poseidon Adventure is maybe the finest example of it's genre & a film that holds up really well even when viewed today. At just over an hour & fifty minutes it's a fairly long film but no time is wasted, the build-up to the disaster is wisely used to introduce some fairly well rounded character's who at least aren't all Hollywood model types or teenagers & these are the sort of people you can relate too in an odd way & understand them. The script also has a bit of depth, in particular keeping faith & trying to overcome the odds no matter what. There are some spectacular action set-pieces aided by some impressive effects works & grand sets, from the initial tidal wave hitting & the mass confusion to various death defying obstacles that need to be overcome there's plenty going on & the film never really lets up. I am not sure why anyone would listen to the preacher & follow him but that's a necessary part of the story I suppose & there doesn't seem to be much of a plan as what they were going to do once they reach the engine room either but that's nothing major. The script is also quite surprising in who it kills off, it's certainly not afraid to kill off it's main character's which is unexpected. The Poseidon Adventure is also one of those rare films that once you start watching it you are engrossed, it's a regular on telly & if I catch a bit I always end up watching it & have seen it several times throughout the years.The sets & production design are great, The Poseidon Adventure is a great film to look at with it's grandiose & epic feel. TRhe action scenes are well handled as is the effects work although some of the model shots look a little dated now. The Poseidon Adventure was apparently shot in sequence so that probably helped the actor's feel what their character's were going through a little better. While the set-pieces are good they are not too extravagant or silly which also helps keep it rooted in reality, there are no indestructible superheroes here as it really does feel like a bunch of ordinary people are trying to survive a near impossible situation.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 the film looks great, the production values are top notch. The acting is very good from a great bunch of real professionals, the cast contains five Oscar winners including Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons & Jack Albertson who all give very watchable performances.The Poseidon Adventure is a great film, it's very watchable, it's fairly intense & has a few surprises on the way too. The best of the 70's disaster films in my opinion. Followed by the sequel Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) while it was also remade as the TV film The Poseidon Adventure (2005) & the big budget Hollywood remake Poseidon (2006).",The Poseidon Adventure
27,Boba_Fett1138,Typical '70's disaster movie made interesting by Hackman and the 'adventerous' story.,7,3 August 2005,"Disaster movies were extremely popular in the '70's. It's really too bad that most of those disaster movie feel terribly outdated today, even at times laughable. Especially the over-dramatized moments and characters are ridicules. Unfortunately ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is no exception. All the typical over-dramatized elements and characters are present here but still this movie remains perfectly watchable today mainly thanks to Hackman's performance and the nice set decorations.Isn't it funny? In almost every disaster movie there are the same type of characters. The main character is always an average Joe that slowly turns into an hero. Other typical characters that are always present in a disaster movie are an elderly couple, annoying kids and a just married/fallen in love couple. No, the characters are not what makes ""The Poseidon Adventure"" a good movie to watch. What makes the movie truly interesting is the adventurous story in which the main group of characters have to find a way to the propeller shaft which is their only hope of escape from the up-side-down ship. The fact that the ship is up-side-down provides some nice and also original, tense moments.The whole sequences in which the ship capsizes is one to remember...because it's extremely laughable. I know, I am ashamed of myself. It was supposed to be a dramatic and shocking scene but I couldn't help laughing when the camera made those weird movements and those people pretended to be falling down when in fact they were just standing still. Seriously, it was almost slapstick like!Hackman is awfully good as the main character Reverend Scott. Looking at this movie it was pretty obvious that it was made in his ""The French Connection"" period. The rest of the cast never succeeds in making their character really likable or emotionally involving enough, with the excepting of Leslie Nielsen's role as the Captain perhaps but his role is unfortunately too small. Not many people realize this but in the period when Nielsen still played serious roles, instead of in silly comedies, he was a pretty good and talented actor. He kind of ruined his own career by appearing only in silly comedies these days.This movie is best watchable if you're a fan of disaster movies. I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of those and the only disaster movie from the '70's I really like is ""The Towering Inferno"" but still this movie is a good second on my list.And for what it's worth, it's in my opinion on par with ""Titanic"" from 1997.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Poseidon Adventure
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Still holds up... hardly dated at all,7,30 December 2007,"The clothes and the likes are really the only thing that date this film. 35 years old, and it still holds up well. No CGI featured, and none required. I have not read the book of this film, so I cannot say if it is an accurate adaptation, in the spirit of the original. I will say that it is a well-produced piece of fiction. The plot is quite good. The writing is good, and has very realistic, great moments. Dialog is well-done, and delivered equally well. The characters are credible and well-written. There is a reasonable amount of development and background for them. The special effects are undeniably excellently done. They are convincing throughout. Nature itself becomes the threat, with realistic physics. The camera-work and editing are nicely done, save for an awkward cut or two. Cinematography is effective. The pacing is solid for the whole film. As far as the technical aspect goes, the film is great. The acting is of high quality. The kid isn't the most annoying ever seen. The tension is admirable. I haven't watched particularly many disaster films... in fact, this film may be 50% of the total amount... so I can't say if this is an outstanding one. I'm not sure you can really watch this without noticing the theme of passivity versus activity... or, blind faith versus a more critical, independent faith. The film takes a definite stance on that. All in all, entertaining and worth your time. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or the genre. 7/10",The Poseidon Adventure
29,neil-476,Excellent,9,20 April 2011,"This first version of Paul Gallicoe's novel was one of several movies at around the same time which more or less set up a template followed by disaster movies ever since - there is some major disaster (in this case a tidal wave turns the luxury liner Poseidon upside down without sinking it). An intrepid group of survivors sets out to find rescue/salvation, but not all of them survive. What follows is the action/adventure of their quest for survival, and the suspense of guessing who will make it and who won't (see also Airport, The Towering Inferno, Earthquake et al).This is one of the better ones, and not just because it is one of the first. It benefits greatly from the upside down sets, which fire the imagination, and also because the group of survivors are well watched and well cast. Plus, in Gene Hackman's fiery (and unlikely clergyman), it has an excellent lead.I must also put in a word of praise for Carol Lynley's velvet hotpants, which left a profound impression on me, metaphorically speaking.",The Poseidon Adventure
30,evanston_dad,This Ain't the Love Boat,6,21 May 2007,"The movie that answered the question, ""Will Shelley Winters float?"" (The answer is ""yes"").""Airport"" (1970) introduced the world to the all-star disaster movie, and they only got more and more ridiculous from that point on. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is pretty good in a cheesy, riotously corny sort of way. This all-star cast includes Gene Hackman as perhaps cinema's only action hero priest (take that Bing Crosby!), Ernest Borgnine as a detective, Leslie Nielsen as captain of the oceanliner Poseidon, Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson as a frumpy Jewish couple, and a bunch of others, like Red Buttons and Roddy McDowall, who seemed to make a living from appearing as guest stars in movies like this. There's the required movie ballad (in this one it's ""The Morning After,"" sung at a New Year's Eve party in one of the clunkiest examples of foreshadowing ever put to screen); the expensive-looking production design, most of the time much more interesting than the story or the actors; and all of the ridiculously melodramatic plot lines that are supposed to make us care what happens to any of these people. The ship overturns, a man falls through a window, Winters takes a swim, Hackman takes a dive, and the lucky survivors pop out of the ship's bottom into the bright sunlight, no one taking a moment to ask how a giant ship could capsize without sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Was the Poseidon made out of cork?If you need to console yourself, just remember that 1972 also gave us ""Cabaret,"" ""Deliverance"" and ""The Godfather,"" so it wasn't a total waste....Grade: B",The Poseidon Adventure

34,Aaron1375,Very nice disaster movie featuring a ship turned upside down.,9,7 July 2010,"I always enjoyed this disaster movie from the 70's. For the time the effects are very nice and it has a nice assortment of characters in it as well. Though I do feel Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnaine steal the show (though others have their moments). This one moves at a bit of a slower pace than the remake that went virtually unnoticed at the box office and I think that helps this one a bit. Let's face it, in that one there was virtually no thinking before people started doing crazy stuff to get out while here there was some debating going on. The story is about a ship that gets hit by a very big wave and gets tipped over so that the bottom of the ship is now the top and the top is the bottom. I am not sure how well a ship flipped would handle taking on water and such, but I think it is safe to assume that the air in the ship would slow its progress down a bit, though not sure to the degree this movie shows. This one has your basic group of plucky survivors trying to make their way to the bottom of the ship which is now the top, thus it is the only way to freedom. Some just want to wait for rescue though in the ballroom. So you get your survivors making their way along facing obstacle after obstacle and losing the occasional member. This one is much better than a later disaster film called ""When Time Ran Out"" featuring a volcano as this one has a lot more of the disaster happening and a lot more action. That one was way to much lead up and not enough going on after said disaster. There would be a sequel to this one, which makes little sense when you think about it, but for my money this is the best flipped over ship movie trumping the sequel and its remake though I enjoyed that one a bit too.",The Poseidon Adventure

No really huge stars were in this but a lot of veteran cast members, a young Gene Hackman.The screen while a bit hokey is supplemented by the special effects with the water racing the survivors through the decks. The effects were so well done that Allen would get a bigger budget and even more hokey Towering Inferno after this one. This movie sort of kicked off several disaster films after it.Maureen McGovern would hit the pop music charts with The Morning After from this movie. With the death of the musicals, films would do one major song. She did another less memorable song in Towering Inferno.The story here is whole cloth, fictional from start to finish. If your a fan of phony Melo-Drama, this movie is for you. If your not a fan of Leslie Nielson, this movie is for you as he does not last past the first big wave.Old actors Jack Albertson, Red Buttonas , and Ernest Borgnine, plus Shelly Winters are pretty durable in this one.

38,Red-Barracuda,A fun disaster movie,7,22 November 2010,"This is one of those movies I guess you could compare to comfort food. It's always the same and it's nice to know it's there. Its story, about a luxury liner that is capsized by a tidal wave leaving a group of survivors to travel 'up to the bottom' of the ship to escape, is known to most people. For some reason, the 70's was the golden era of disaster movies and I think The Poseidon Adventure ushered that age in. It's not really hard to see why, as it's a very efficient and entertaining film.Some folks consider this flick a camp classic, and I suppose I can understand why that might be so to a certain extent – there are some hokey scenes and silly dialogue such as the 'did you like his music' exchange. While the likes of Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine seem to be competing against each other to see who can chew up the most scenery, such is their over-acting. None of this hurts the film though, it's all for the greater good. It also makes me chuckle to think that the most ridiculous screen couple in cinematic history – Martin and Nonnie – actually couldn't bear each other in real-life, and only inter-acted when they had to shoot a scene. In addition it is an absolute impossibility to watch Leslie Nielsen as the captain of the ship without thinking of his comic turn in the disaster movie spoof Airplane!Despite all this the movie works as a good adventure film. The setting of the up-turned ship is great, and is used to good effect. There are a number of nicely staged set-pieces throughout that ensure that the pace never gets bogged down. The New Year's Eve aspect also works in its favour as it ensures the movie will always be a festive season staple, which certainly adds to its overall appeal. It's still a fairly derivative film in many ways though and its characters do seem to fill certain clearly defined roles. You know Stella Stevens character is doomed the instant she mocks Shelley Winters for being fat. And as for the young boy? His unconcerned incessant upbeat chat was, I suppose, meant to reflect the innocence of youth but really it made you actually think that he was either moderately autistic or annoying beyond belief; my guess was it was probably the latter and I wouldn't have blamed the group if they had decided to throw him in the sea.Overall, a good bit of escapist hokum.",The Poseidon Adventure

40,Robert_duder,"The King of disaster movies, brilliant and an absolute classic!!",10,17 February 2006,"I picked up this original classic as I anxiously await for the remake opening soon in theaters. I had never seen the original and I was absolutely blown away. Never before have I been a big fan of Gene Hackmans. He's a versatile actor who's been around a long time but I never much enjoyed him and finally after many years he won me over in a huge way and proved his stardom. The entire cast comes together as a group and creates a death defying story of a group of survivors making their way from the bottom of a ship (which was the top before it capsized) to the top (formerly the bottom.) Everything comes together to make The Poseidon Adventure the brilliant classic that it is. The performances, the story, the adventure, the action, the writing, the directing, the brilliant setting...you can't beat this film and there is nothing else like it.Gene Hackman plays Reverand Frank Scott. A rather loud mouthed, do things his own way preacher who has had some fallings out with God. Nonetheless he's brave and caring and a leader at heart. When the ship capsizes it is him who leaps to action to save not just one or two people but everyone aboard the ship. Unfortunately most will not listen to him. This is hands down Hackman's most brilliant and wonderful performance. He should have absolutely taken home some awards for his role. Ernest Borgnine plays brash and tough cop Mike Rogo. He's the perfect balance to Hackman's character and they clash for leadership but also work together to save lives. They have great chemistry opposite each other and he's a loud mouth fun character. Shelley Winters is terrific as Mrs. Belle Rosen and equally good is her husband Jack Albertson as Mr. Rosen. Together they are ""everyones"" grandparents and you root for them as they make their way through and overcome some real adversity to escape. Stella Stevens is terrific opposite Borgnine as his equally loud mouthed wife Linda. Their banter and arguing but love for one another is fun to watch. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea do a great job as the younger members of the cast, brother and sister Susan and Robin Shelby. Roddy McDowall makes a brief if not a little unremarkable appearance as ship hand Acres, and watch for Leslie Nielson in an equally brief but more important and stand out role as the Captain of The Poseidon. Red Buttons plays quiet nice guy James, and Carol Lynley plays his love interest of sorts Nonnie, whose brother's death aboard the Poseidon makes her wonder if life is worth continuing but James pushes her through and saves her every time. With such an enormous starring cast...the majority of them share equal screen time it's amazing that most of them manage to give stand out performances. Some stronger than others but all of them make up an important ensemble and each play a role that you enjoy watching. Nobody is ever safe and with only a few survivors you fear for them aboard the ship.The setting for this film is absolutely unique and incredible. Your average sinking ship disaster film is changed immensely when they are escaping from a completely capsized cruise ship. Everything is upside down, creating a world unknown to them due to that. Scenes in washrooms, kitchens, hallways, doorways all become new terrain because it's all upside down and creates a uniqueness and cinematographic brilliance. The Tag line really says it all...Hell...Upside Down. That's exactly what it is. You become so attached to each and every one of the cast members...most of all Hackman's hero. There are some very minor downsides...at times the acting gets a little over the top, their fear and moments of emotion are almost campy and overdone which can happen in a disaster film. They want to give it their all. I also felt that the women in the film, although strong characters were intensely sexualized. For 99% of the film Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and even Pamela Sue Martin shed their dresses and pranced around the ship baring their very long legs. I think that was to really mainstream the film and I suppose it did that but seemed out of place and almost blatant at times. That aside The Poseidon Adventure is an absolute classic, brilliantly made, and a constant edge of your seat adventure. You'll wish there was more when it's all said and done. You'll laugh and cry and root for them...it's the best classic I have seen in a very, very long time and one of my favorite movies hands down. 10/10",The Poseidon Adventure
41,Lejink,Flat Liner,2,5 September 2021,"I came to this film after recently watching two great movies starring Gene Hackman, ""The French Connection"" and ""The Conversation"" but in between the two, he starred in this, the biggest-grossing film of 1972. In the jet-stream of ""Airport"", multi-starring ""disaster"" movies were in vogue and in quick succession there appeared other big-budget features taking in infernos, earthquakes and airships. Much later, of course, James Cameron added his own exclamation mark to the whole sub-genre with ""Titanic"".So why were these movies so popular? Certainly, audiences were attracted to features boasting many well-known faces as opposed to the usual one-or-two starring leads, there were the special effects of course, but most of all, I think it was the ""there but for the grace of God"" feeling they invoked in the viewer who could easily imagine themselves in similarly traumatic situations. Money-spinners they usually were, but they were often criticised for being trite, clichéd, over-the-top and generally lacking in artistic merit.Well, let me tell you that ""The Poseidon Adventure"" certainly isn't about to buck that trend. The ""Poseidon"" is a past-its-best old-time luxury liner, on its last Atlantic crossing before it's broken up for scrap. Naturally, every second counts getting this last journey over and done and sure enough the old commerce-versus-customer-care chestnut raises its head with the anonymous, besuited representative of the shipping company clashing with the conscientious captain, exhorting him to go ""full steam ahead"" and hang the consequences. Unfortunately, instead there's a full storm ahead and before you know it, the old boat has been flipped over (is that even possible?), eventually leaving a small band of passengers in a race for the top (which is actually the bottom!), as they attempt to escape.Hackman, with a fine new head-of-hair it has to be said, is the thundering latter-day preacher who, Moses-like, leads his motley flock through the decks of the stricken ship, amongst them loud-mouthed ex-cop Ernest Borgnine and his ex-prostitute wife Stella Stevens, who gamely keeps her high-heels on through hell and high-water, a loving old Jewish husband and wife, Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters, the ship's cowardly-lion steward, Red Buttons who earns his stripes by taking in hand the wonderfully-named young female singer, Nonny, played Carol Lynley, who wouldn't you know it, can't swim, sort of making her a Hey-Nonny-No, I guess you'd say. There also a young adult female and her smart-alick kid brother to make up the numbers. Oh, almost forgot Roddy McDowall although it's no great spoiler alert to reveal they kill off him off early which in truth is fair exchange for him doing the same to his attempted Scottish accent.They must have all feasted on ham at the ship's banquet which would explain the ensemble acting quality, the dialogue is banal throughout, none-more so than Hackman's last dialogue with God, while Ms Winters' ""I can do this, I'm a champion swimmer"" spiel before she plunges into the depths was an instantly-mocked camp classic. There's even the odd sight of Leslie Nielsen warming up for ""Airplane"" duty, as the crusty old captain.Someone said to me once that I should make a point of occasionally reviewing bad films and I guess I knew what I was taking on when I boarded this particular accident waiting-to-happen sea-cruise. All I can say in that regard is, that unlike the ship itself, it didn't let me down.",The Poseidon Adventure
42,ElMaruecan82,"Delightfully ""over the top"" ...",8,16 October 2012,"Let me start this review by giving ""The Poseidon Adventure"" the credit it deserves. Ronald Neame's film is a spectacular entertainment and the accomplishment is even more impressive because way back in 1972, filmmakers couldn't rely on CGI and digital effects. To recreate the nightmarish setting of an upside-down boat with such a gritty realism elevates ""The Poseidon Adventure"", on a pure technical level, into a milestone in the same vein than ""Star Wars"" or ""Who's Afraid of Roger Rabbit"". But the risk with special effects is that they are often taken for granted as the only pillar of the film's success instead of being exploited for the sake of a story. Indeed, even the most dazzling images and impressive stunts aren't enough to hook an audience from the beginning of the show to its end, otherwise, it's called overproduction or simply show-off. A film is still about people and it's of people that viewers care, rather than moving, flying, falling or exploding objects, no matter how big they are. I guess that's the reason why disaster films rely on an all-star cast; there have to be recognizable faces to drive empathy because, given the parameters of the genre, each character has a limited screen presence, so there's no time for getting too psychological about them. This is why among the characters who survived the spectacular giant wave; most of them are Oscar-winning actors, an unknown face, an extra is only a soon-to-be-corpse. And on the casting department, ""Poseidon"" offers a very sympathetic gallery centered on the impassioned Frank Scott, the reverend with unconventional methods, played by Gene Hackman and the sweet and caring Belle Rosen, the Jewish grandmother, played by an Oscar- nominated Shelley Winters. The rest of the cast includes the gentle Red Buttons, the torridly sexy Stella Stevens, a handsome Roddy McDowell and Ernest Borgnine as the obligatory short-tempered character, you know, the one-who-is-always-wrong. There has to be the guy who never pays attention to a child when he gives precious information, to systematically disagree with the hero's choices. And although Borgnine's tantrum gets a little bit repetitive, he's obviously a confused man with arms of steel and heart of gold (Rest in Peace, Ernie!).The performances are unequally convincing, some characters, especially female like the scared singer or the teenager with infatuated with the robust hero, are obviously meant to fill obligatory archetypes, but it's never overused in the film, the center of gravity remains Frank Scott, and the claustrophobic journey he leads in the belly of 'The Poseidon"" from the top to the bottom (the bottom which happens to be at the top, follow me?) a trajectory that will not go without obstacles and a few collateral damages in the process. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" follows a very simple plot line, but this simplicity serves the film because it goes straight to the point in a very short running time, a good choice because more would have been boring. Maybe that's because the scale is smaller than other disaster films such as ""Airport"", ""Earthquake"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" but it fits in the case of ""Poseidon"".Still, there are several aspects that can't be seen in a non-sarcastic way, I, myself, couldn't take seriously the sight of Leslie Nielsen as the Captain, although I'm aware he started in serious roles. I laughed at the one-dimensional managing businessman who orders to increase the speed, I wanted the kid to shut his mouth sometimes and act like a real one who'd be more scared than thrilled by this adventure, not like the blonde singer mind you because that one who almost got on my nerves. Or maybe I was too distracted by the panties of Stella Stevens, or some campy lines such as one passenger who says ""the pursuer is right"" with such passion and intensity, it obviously serves to underscore Scott's position as a misunderstood loner. But I didn't laugh very long because the basis of the adventure and the efficiency of the special effects really grabbed me.I also didn't laugh because I felt concerned by some characters, and that's another positive consequence of the minimal casting that gives another edge over the other disaster films.Without spoiling the events, it's obvious that there are more deaths to go during the heart- pounding journey, but one of them, and the reaction it inspired from Gene Hackman touched me deeply in the heart. It's one thing to see some stuff coming; it's another to genuinely react despite the predictability. The film owes a lot to Hackman's electrifying performance that earned him a BAFTA Award, he plays with the same level of sincerity as if it was a drama, and that's the mark of great actors. He delivers in the early sequence a powerful speech asking people to see themselves as elements of a whole, to find their inner strength in order to contribute to a larger effort, naturally, the whole film comes as a practice of his own theories. It's a speech for the strong, retorts another priest played by Arthur O'Connell, but it's not about strength, it's about courage, and the film does convey this inspirational element, confronting the hero to his own faith during the climax.I could have said that the film only works as a big-screen spectacle, but again, it's short enough, the spectacular effects and the characterization are so well done that it's possible to enjoy it on TV, it's your typically pop-corn film but who said you couldn't eat pop-corn at home. The laughable elements I described suffer more from their overusing in the movies made after, so in all fairness, there's nothing to blame on ""Poseidon"". It can be campy sometimes with this 70's feel betrayed by the looks and the delightfully cheesy ""Morning After"" song, it is often over the top (no pun intended) but it works. It definitely does.",The Poseidon Adventure
43,g-bodyl,Superior to the Remake!,9,14 July 2012,"The Poseidon Adventure is a much better disaster film than the 2006 remake based off this film. I only saw this film because I wanted to compare it to 2006 version but I founded out that it would not be a good idea. Even the special effects in this movie are groundbreaking when compared to the remake.This film is about a group of survivors on the S.S Poseidon and their goal is to make it out of the ship alive.This movie features many great actors such as Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgigine, Red Buttons, and Leslie Nielsen. They all deliver gritty, sometimes heart-wrenching performances.One thing that really amazed me is the visual effects. They are quite groundbreaking when this film came out in 1972 and I think it still holds up pretty well today.Overall, this is the father of all disaster films!

44,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Sometimes, if you wanna go up, you have to go down.",7,19 November 2006,"It may not seem like anything particularly new these days, especially after the revival of disaster films in the late 90s. But in 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was a somewhat groundbreaking film. But we're used to a group of survivors fighting against floods, earthquakes, storms, sinking vessels, zombies, volcanoes etc so you have to keep this in mind when watching it.Taken from Paul Gallico's novel (who himself was one a ship that almost capsized) the film features an all-star cast (though young viewers will probably not recognize a single one of them save Gene Hackman or Leslie Nielsen) with 7 Academy Awards between them. Surely, the bigger the stars have a bigger chance of survival! Not so! A capsized ship has many different ways of killing you as our unfortunate stars learn...the hard way. None of it is particularly graphic but there is a lot of tension and claustrophobia that makes it work. And the sets are quite impressive, if a little dated. When the Poseidon flips over it's already an ancient ship heading for the scrapyard. It would have been better if they destroyed something brand new and pretty, but I guess that means it wouldn't be so dirty and menacing when upside-down and full of salt-water.Followed by a sequel in 1979 and a new version in 2006, TPA has become famous as the film that started the disaster genre and Irwin Allen as its creator. Truth be told, Allen only ever directed 2 (and a bit) of these movies and produced a couple more. I guess it's because TPA made such an impression that his name was linked to disaster movies he wasn't even involved with.Strange though to think that Gene Hackman hated making the movie and has apparently, to this day, refused to watch it. Much like Ed Harris in the Abyss. I guess some bald actors should just stay out of the water.",The Poseidon Adventure
45,kenjha,Recipe for Disaster,8,14 January 2011,"After an ocean liner is capsized, survivors make their way to the bottom of the ship, which by then is the top. Although ""Airport"" was released two years earlier, it was the box office success of this film that truly launched the all-star disaster movie genre in the 1970s and established the recipe for disaster - just add water in this case. The dialog is pedestrian and the acting is uneven, but the film is a lot of fun in a trashy sort of way. Once the tidal wave hits, one is swept into the story (so to speak). Hackman leads the all-star cast as a fiery preacher, but there's the usual assortment of characters, and every star gets to ham it up a bit. Williams adds an ominous score.",The Poseidon Adventure

47,paulclaassen,Did I just watch a comedy with TERRIBLE dialogue or a disaster film??,4,16 June 2018,"The film must have been exceptional at the time of release but unfortunately did not stood the test of time. The ship so clearly is nothing more than a model in a pond. The ship's interior scenes were far more realistic and here the sets were quite impressive. The script was corny and silly, though, and at times it felt I was watching a comedy or spoof instead of a dramatic disaster movie. The dialogue was really bad - no, terrible, actually. At times the silly dialogue was just downright inappropriate and I couldn't help but wonder what the hell they were thinking! The acting was also over-dramatic and over-sentimental, and not believable at all. None of the characters were really fleshed out and seemed very one-dimensional. How did the preacher (Hackman) know so much about the ship anyway that he was able to lead everyone through an upside down ship to where they needed to be? At one point he says ""Just one more door and we're home"". What did he mean?? They're in the middle of the ocean on a capsized boat!!! They had no idea what was waiting for them on the outside...At the end our hero (Hackman) also seems to simply give up by 'falling' into an inferno. There didn't appear to be any struggle on his behalf - he just let go for no reason. I didn't find that scene one bit believable.

49,poe426,That sinking feeling...,10,18 July 2014,"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was THE blockbuster of its time, and for good reason: it had it all, from gifted actors giving solid performances (working from an excellent script, under the sure hand of a talented director) to some of the most realistic sets and fx to ever come sailing down the pike. When the wall of water was shown rumbling ominously toward us, I was quite literally on the edge of my seat. As the ship began to slowly tilt onto its side, one couldn't help but tilt one's head to follow the action. This was one of the most believable sequences I'd ever seen- and the thought that everyone was now UNDER WATER with no apparent way out was absolutely terrifying. Throughout the movie, the use of hand-held cameras (or tilted sets or whatever they did) lent the whole thing a degree of believability rarely found in feature films; I actually felt a touch of sea-sickness throughout. The subsequent struggle for survival- and the fact that only a handful of people would survive- helped make THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE one of my more vivid childhood memories. The intensity of the performances (as Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine, both utterly believable, went head-to-head every step of the way as the ship slowly sank) only enhanced the overall experience (lesser actors could've rendered the whole thing laughable, but here we had seasoned professionals giving outstanding performances).

52,Lechuguilla,Highly Entertaining,9,12 May 2013,"Water assumes the role of villain, as a small group of passengers try to move ever upward inside a capsized and sinking ship, in what is one of the better 1970s disaster films. The film starts with a screen notice that informs viewers ""There were only a handful of survivors. This is their story."" Which of course keeps viewers wondering who will survive and who will die. And so the first third of the film is interesting in that we get some good character development, courtesy of a well-developed, character-driven script and an all-star ensemble cast. When a major character dies we feel a sense of loss.A lot of the nail-biting tension derives from the tight, claustrophobic interiors through which characters must traverse. And I must say the props, literally upside-down, were terrifically designed. It's hard to imagine these interiors were all built sets. With appropriately placed echoes, plus the sound of steam and rushing water, the film's sound effects are almost as impressive as the visuals.A couple of sequences are quite dramatic. One is the festive New Years eve ballroom segment. As the external wave hits the ship, everything begins to slide at an angle that becomes ever more steep. Here, film editing creates a sense of horrifying realism, with just the right quantity and quality of screen cuts. Ditto the Christmas tree panic sequence.Cinematography is highly effective. In many scenes one source of light augmented by a bit of back-lighting makes for just the right visual effect. An unobtrusive score in the right places adds emotional depth.In sync with the dialogue, acting trends heartfelt. Most performers give quite a good performance. I especially liked Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters.Several minor complaints include dialogue that is a tad too sentimental in spots, some rather too obvious plot clichés, and thematic depth that trends a bit shallow, pardon the pun. None of these script issues are serious.""The Poseidon Adventure"" aims for a high level of entertainment value. With a good script, terrific cinematography and editing, and some fine acting, I think it succeeds.",The Poseidon Adventure
53,snoozejonc,Highly enjoyable movie that entertains in many different ways.,8,25 November 2020,"An ocean liner is hit by a tidal wave and capsizes.This is a movie that for me works on a number of levels due to its solid production values, simple premise, entertaining characters and memorable dialogue.Sensibly for a movie made in the early 70s the effects are minimal and practical for what it tries to achieve. I found the concept of the ship capsizing plausible without the need to suspend disbelief. Interestingly my four year old daughter understood what was happening without needing me to explain it, which for me is the ultimate sign of success.Another positive is the simplicity of the plot. After the Poseidon flips over we have short number of set-pieces involving obstacles the characters have to overcome in order to survive. Each of the obstacles is plausible and clearly presented to the audience.The characters are clearly defined and I personally find them entertaining. Each has a role to play in defining the movie's main theme of survival. Reverend Scott goes against the general opinion of all authority figures to lead the passengers towards what he believes to be safety. He is played charismatically but sometimes slightly over the top by Gene Hackman. Ernest Borgnine matches Hackman's strong presence as the antagonistic policeman Mr Rojo and for me expresses anger in a more natural and believable way. Red Buttons brings a calming influence to scenes of high drama and his character keeps everyone's focus on the tasks at hand. Shelly Winters as Mrs Rosen considers herself a liability until her moment to shine arrives and she takes centre stage.There are a number of classic lines that are highly memorable. Some have excellent timing and help diffuse the tension. Others I suspect to be unintentionally funny, but they entertain nonetheless. Leslie Neilson as the captain has a serious role, but because it's him and he's so deadpan it's hard not to laugh at everything that comes out of his mouth. On a similar note some moments are slightly silly but never fail to make me laugh, like when Nonnie sees the water level rising through an upside down stairwell and her reaction is a fabulous old fashioned horror-movie type scream.In contrast, my favourite part is when Nonnie is frozen with fear in the midst of climbing a ladder through the ventilation shaft, and Mr Martin helps her to overcome the moment and start moving again. This for me is so brilliantly and realistically done that you feel for the both of them. Mr Rojo also delivers an epic line as he is situated just below them on the ladder.I think if you go into the Poseidon Adventure looking to see the spectacle of a ship capsizing you will be ultimately disappointed. The film is a character study about survival. It is about strength, weakness, compassion, guilt, leadership, conformity and the human condition in a survival situation.For my daughter and I, it provided solid entertainment and a much needed break from Disney princesses.",The Poseidon Adventure
54,jimbo-53-186511,Intense & brilliant,8,16 December 2014,"It's New Year's Eve and a cruise liner is making a journey from New York to Athens. The ship is on its final voyage when it becomes engulfed by a huge tidal wave a few hundred miles off the Greek coast. Many of the crew and passengers are killed in the aftermath. However, a small team of passengers (against all odds)work together to try to find an escape route from the ship.Wow talk about intense!! Once this film gets going it is an absolutely first rate thriller/adventure/survival film. Prior to the 'disaster' occurring, we're introduced to several characters who end up as 'key' survivors. Many of the characters are strong and this helps to increase the intensity of the experience. Hackman and Borgnine are both particularly good; Borgnine makes no secret of the fact that he doesn't approve of Hackman being in charge of the group. I suspect that this is partly down to the fact that he's got a bit of an inferiority complex with Hackman and partly down to his police roots (he was probably used to ordering people around). The kid was annoying in the early stages, but he actually proved to be quite an integral part of the team which was great to watch.As well as being majorly intense and incredibly entertaining, the Poseidon Adventure is also incredibly moving. In fact, the only times that the film loses a little bit of momentum is when it shows snippets from other individuals that are trapped on the boat. This isn't a criticism as even on the occasions when it's not focused on the team escaping the boat there are still many emotional and moving moments. That's what I loved about this film, it seemed that no matter what it was doing it was doing it right. It was intense, the performances were good (particularly from Hackman & Borgnine) and the chemistry between the cast as a whole was superb.

56,lukem-52760,Total Classic & Gene Hackman is one of the greatest actors of Cinema History.,10,4 October 2021,"The Poseidon Adventure is definitely my favourite of the 70's Disaster Adventures films that was a big theme during those times & with many big films coming out such as Earthquake & The Towering Inferno.This is brilliant 70's filmmaking & its a Classic movie.We get a real treat of a suspenseful adventure with top class acting from all involved & a magnificent performance from the great Gene Hackman. In fact Gene's performance is one of the greatest of Cinema History in my opinion & rivals his own Award-winning performance from the Classic French Connection.What makes The Poseidon Adventure so damn great is it has an excellent cast of characters that you actually care about & like.What a cast, Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Roddy Mcdowell, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters & Leslie Neilson.This Classic feeling Adventure flick has an excellent cast with the likes of Gene Hackman (Enemy of the State, The French Connection, Behind Enemy Lines) as a priest who is trying with everything he has to get a small group of survivors to safety when the big cruise ship is hit by a huge wave & turns her upside-down. Gen Hackman is a great actor that's a fact & here he gives a superb performance as a religious man but also a realistic man & a man that also seems like he's about to explode with rage. Hackman plays the part as a smart guy who questions ""God"" when times are hard & i loved that about his character because really all that religion & ""God"" stuff is just bullsh#t as it doesn't exist & even Hackman's character questions it as praying does absolutely nothing!!! & it never answers anyone is a terrible situation. Anyway stupid religious crap aside, Hackman is great as the no-nonsense Reverend pushing & fighting every obstacle in their way. Also the great Ernest Borgnine (R. I. P) Escape from New York, Voice of Mermaid Man from Spongebob Squarepants) is equally great as stressed out off duty cop on the cruise with his ex-prostitute wife & a man that buts heads all the time with Hackman's leading Reverend. Also a small bit-part for Roddy Mcdowell (Planet of the Apes, Columbo, Fright Night) as one of the group & to be honest the whole little band of survivors are all decent actors with decent performances. Even the nice grandad from the 70's Classic Charlie & the Chocolate Factory is here too.The film still looks Beautiful. The production design is superb with the place looking perfectly upside-down.The cinematography is excellent.The musical is suspenseful.I loved the Classic scene where our group climbs up the massive Xmas tree to safety.The movie is perfectly suspenseful & exciting at the same time.This is probably my favourite of those Awesome 70's Disaster Adventures.",The Poseidon Adventure
57,slokes,Bottoms Up!,5,31 May 2006,"""The Morning After"" was an incongruous choice for the theme to a disaster movie about a ship turned upside down, yet it fits ""The Poseidon Adventure"" to a tee. Not only do the hopeful lyrics mirror the situation faced by Rev. Scott and the ship's other survivors seen in the film, but it alerts you right up front you are in for a kitschy, cheesy time.On New Year's Eve, the S.S. Poseidon is hit by a giant wave in the middle of the ocean, capsizing the ship. Among the survivors are ten people, led by Rev. Scott (Gene Hackman), who believe their best chance lies in climbing up the upside-down vessel to the engine room, where the hull is thinnest. Will there be a morning after?The answer depends on which member of the all-star cast you are talking about. Will that sweet bachelor with the bow tie played by Red Buttons make it? How about the pretty girl in the red hot pants (Pamela Sue Martin)? They wouldn't kill Shelley Winters, would they? Or Jack Albertson, who plays her doting husband? It's the sort of formula that turned up later in ""Murder She Wrote"": When everyone in the cast is a star, it's harder to guess who lives and who dies.You never forget you are watching a movie viewing ""The Poseidon Adventure."" In a way, this is fine. You don't always need to be sold on the reality of a film you are seeing, sometimes you can get as much enjoyment wondering what it was like to shoot the picture, the backstage arguments, the catering, hassles over scary stunts, etc. But ""Poseidon Adventure"" really leans on this indulgence.In the most famous scene in the movie, when a passenger falls backwards into a giant window, you can't help but see the crash pads beneath the candy glass, a lazy bit of editing. The script doesn't trust you to figure out who the mono-dimensional characters are; instead Scott introduces himself as ""angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade."" When arguing with a passenger played by Ernest Borgnine, Scott suggests that ""we're two of a kind, and you don't like looking at yourself."" Huh?Watching the ship's captain call someone ""you irresponsible bastard"" shouldn't be a laugh-getter, but it is because that's Leslie Nielsen playing the captain and he's doing that same deadpan he later perfected in comedies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun.""The best thing about ""Poseidon Adventure"" is Stella Stevens, who plays Borgnine's hot and whiny wife with real gusto. Unlike five of her castmates, she hadn't won an Oscar, but she seems the most energized, giving a lively performance without going overboard a la Hackman and Borgnine. ""I'm going next, so if old fat ass gets stuck, I won't be caught behind her,"" she says, one of many weight jokes poor Winters has to endure. Plus, wearing only a shirt and panties, Stevens makes otherwise dull ladder-climbing scenes quite stimulating.To say ""Poseidon Adventure"" isn't entertaining would be wrong. It's professionally put together, vividly acted, and satisfying in its big-movie way. But it wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is with people today if it wasn't for its high camp value, the polyester and perms redolent with the aura of the early '70s not to mention that Maureen McGovern AM classic that binds the whole thing together.""Did you like his music?"" asks the singer holding her dead guitar-playing brother. Lines like that make ""Poseidon Adventure"" so bad it's good, or good it's bad. No wonder the ship turned over!",The Poseidon Adventure
58,Samiam3,Nothing like a little adventure at sea,7,22 July 2009,"I'm sure this has happened to many viewers by now, but I saw Poseidon Adventure after I saw Wolfgang Peterson's remake. I'm not sure If that had any effect on my liking this one more or not, maybe a little. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are far more interesting than Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, and quite frankly, the special effects in the remake were not all that stunning. It feels like more work went into this movie, things are so much easier today with CG, and rather than eye candy, this movie aims at more dialog and character dimension. Well, it works.One night at sea, the luxury cruiser Poseidon, goes from being heaven to a hell hole when the ship is struck by a 'rogue wave' which flips it upside down. The few survivors led by the young preacher (Hackman) must work their way up to the hull (there a phrase you'd never expect to use when talking ships) in order to get out before the vessel floods and goes under.Peterson's version may have been more suspenseful, but suspense alone does not make a good thriller. This one paces itself a little more slowly giving it time to set up the characters, which of course is good. The only thing I didn't like about the pacing was the ending which was rushed by a couple of minutes I think. (I would've like to seen the ship go under just moment after our protagonists escape in dramatic fashion). That couldn't have been such a hard effect to do, wonder why it didn't happen.Oh well, nothing is perfect. Poseidon Adventure was the first major disaster flick, and even though I don't think it is one of the best, I strongly feel that movie goers who haven't seen it yet should do so, not simply for entertainment but to see where the sub genre of thriller took off from.",The Poseidon Adventure
59,Spleen,I'd like to be kind without in any way suggesting that it's good,7,11 February 2001,"Remember the bit where they climb the upside-down Christmas tree? ""You'll have to take off your skirt,"" says Reverend Frank Scott, to Susan.  Good call! - and actress Pamela Sue Martin dutifully disrobes.  ""And your dress,"" he says, to Linda.  An even better call.  Actress and former Playmate Stella Stevens protests that she's not wearing a bra.  ALL RIGHT!  But, alas, Ernest Borgnine lends her his shirt, an item of clothing that manages to remain opaque even when drenched by the Atlantic Ocean, and we aren't allowed to see her magnificent, plunging cleavage ever again.  Why tease us like this?  I don't really mind how heavily dressed Stella Stevens is; what I object to is being promised a strip show and then denied one.This, my friends, is a supremely silly movie.  It probably seemed less silly once.  It's an accident of history that the Leslie Nielsen, who plays the ship's captain, ended up playing so many deadpan comedy roles that we're tempted to think he must be doing the same thing here.  Yet converse reasoning also applies.  Gene Hackman has become famous since for straight drama; in HIS case, we're tempted to think that he wouldn't be making such a complete ass of himself unless he were doing so deliberately.  And look at Ernest Borgnine!  He never so much as cracks a smile.  But we know he can't POSSIBLY be serious.  It's hilarious.Actually, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is by no means contemptible, so far as disaster movies go.  There's the usual bunch of characters (microcosm of humanity, and all that) thrown together by the misfortune; but unlike most disaster movies, this one doesn't make the mistake of telling us too much about the characters before the misfortune strikes.  (Well all right, it does, but most other disaster movies make the same mistake to an even greater degree.)  The characters here have a clearly definable quest (stupid, but clearly defined) and their actions more or less make sense given their ultimate goal.  And they get on with one another well enough to prevent the story from falling apart.Of course it would have been better if it hadn't been so idiotic.  (It could have been witty, it could have been gripping, it could have been touching - there are many ways of failing to be idiotic.)  But it's still somehow sturdy and watchable.  Apart from the cruel way in which we are denied a good look at Stella Stevens, this is one of the least objectionable bad movies around.",The Poseidon Adventure
60,Kingslaay,What a treat,8,23 April 2021,The Poseidon Adventure keeps you on your toes from start to finish. If you can get over the dated visual effects you're in for one great adventure. There is a stellar cast to carry this film. Gene Hackman is a standout and has some great supporting performances from Ernest Borgnine and the other cast. A unique adventure that sees a few survivors try and navigate an upside down ship for survival. You feel the intensity and nerves as they fight for their survival.,The Poseidon Adventure
61,alexanderdavies-99382,By far the best disaster film.,7,28 June 2017,"Here we actually have a well made and entertaining disaster film. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" contains moments of tension and suspense as the survivors of the cruise ship wreck attempt to reach safety and against overwhelming odds.... Most of the time, the leading man or lady isn't required to act very much. They are required to look either brave or frightened. In this case, Gene Hackman made his character - a maverick priest - a multi-dimensional one. He doesn't feel he is any more brave or heroic than the average person. He never forgets the terrible task that he is faced with, as leader of the survivors on board the cruise liner. A great performance. Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters give the best performances in the supporting cast. The screenplay is a lot better than films of this kind usually are. The director Ronald Neame sensibly allows the audience to know the backgrounds of all the main characters before disaster strikes. The introduction of all the characters helps to give them much needed shading. Everything about this film looks frighteningly real. The fact that the ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was directed by an Englishman can't make it that bad a film! This is the definitive disaster film by a long way.",The Poseidon Adventure
62,screenman,A Curate's Egg,7,22 March 2008,"This movie got mixed reviews on its release and you can easily see why.It contains some extremely believable special-effects for its time, and the set-pieces are likewise entirely convincing. The upside-down-ness of the inverted ship is accomplished so well that even after repeated viewings I have never nailed a mistake. For these things alone it is still worth a watch.Suspense is provided by the occasional hazard of fire (though, oddly, never poisonous fumes) and the steadfastly rising sea as the ship settles. The selected-few grub about in the murky bowels of lower deck spaces, constantly ambushed and pursued by the briny. It's all good stuff.There's an interesting pot-pouri of actors. A young, balding priest is played by Gene Hackman (didn't he ever have a full head of hair?). Ernest Borgnine provides his usual sterling performance as someone larger than life in a crude and potentially violent sort of way. His toad-like features have almost always prevented him from playing a heroic leading man, yet he's just as frequently earned top billing despite it. This is a compliment to his acting skills, which - in my opinion - outshine those of Hackman. There are plenty of other B-list stalwarts including Roddy Mcdowell and Shelley Winters. They all do their best.And they need to. Because the parts they play are about as clichéd as they come and the dialogue might have been written on a cigarette packet. The firebrand priest who you know is for the chop (God never likes a smart-arse). The shy middle-aged bachelor who will at last get the girl - albeit half his age (and if you think that will last, you must be from greenland). The kindly fat lady who has 'heart-attack' stamped on her forehead, a policeman who has married a prostitute (gimme a break), and a know-it-all brat you could cheerfully strangle. There's some well-matched conflict between Hackman and Borgnine and one does at least begin to care about the characters, which is what you're supposed to do. There's just not enough mustard with the ham.If anyone has managed so far never to have seen this movie before, they may get a shock to see Leslie Neilsen as the ship's captain, and think they're in for a spoof. Well; daft as some of the dialogue may be, Airplane! it isn't. Neilsen plays it straight.Don't let its age put you off, or the clichés. The post-inversion sequences are so convincing that you'll find yourself rooting for these schmucks even at their dumbest.The Towering Inferno is still a far superior movie, but then what would you expect with Steve McQueen and Paul Newman? If only they had been in Poseidon. They would have demanded plausible characterisation and a better script, and the movie would have been a classic.However.Can a liner remain upside down like that? Maybe. I've seen battleships turn turtle and remain floating for a few minutes, and they have massively heavy armour plating. I sure wouldn't want to find out the hard way.",The Poseidon Adventure

Shelly Winters in unintentionally funny as she bravely swims underwater. The ending is anticlimactic as we are only shown the stern of the ship near the propellers. (Yes, they do show the smokestacks when it first capsizes.) So did they run out-of-budget for the special effects and miniatures in the finale? It should have been subtitled ""Who Dies Next?""

65,MartianOctocretr5,Creative and Superior Disaster Epic,8,6 February 2006,"Although not perfect, this is a very entertaining disaster movie. It has all the elements of ""who will survive"" movies of the '70's, but delivers with creative originality that most of the similar movies that followed it lacked.One of the weaknesses of the movie is that some of the characters are written much more volatile than an ordinary person would be, even under these circumstances. A great cast, however, make these characters as believable as possible, and the audience gets a chance to see who they are, and how they respond to situations and the crisis in general. Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman), a fiery maverick cleric, leads the campaign to escape as their antagonist, the water, keeps on systematically pursuing the group from deck to deck. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine), a tough cop, provides plenty of conflict with an equally strong personality.The cast also includes Stella Stevens, Shelly Winters, Roddy McDowell, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, Red Buttons, and Leslie Nielson. All are terrific in their roles, and bring plenty of emotion, suspense, plot twists, drama, subplots, character development and more to make this an exciting film. There are a few contrivances (such as explosions always occurring at the worst possible moment), but overall, the story works well. Some images are effectively haunting, too, such as the famous scene of a victim falling on a window. The memorable music score is effectively used at key moments to flavor the mood and tension.There is a lot of symbolism in this film, a creative slant that you don't see very often. Some examples: The priest leading the group to a ""promised land."" The reformed prostitute character (Mary Magdalene?). The Christmas tree as a route to safety. The waters ""Flood""ing in.This was the original, and with near-classic status, did not need to be remade. Forget that travesty on TV a few months ago that brazenly used the ""Poseidon"" title, and avoid any other unnecessary counterfeits that they come up with.

67,vip_ebriega,It's highly entertaining.,9,10 August 2007,"My Take: Cheesy as it might be, this ranks as the best of the character-driven disaster movies of the decade. Boy, don't I just love these disaster movies. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is one of the first of its kind, following the success of Ross Hunter's production of ""Airport"", based on the novel by Arthur Hailey. And, well, what can I say? It's highly entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie. It has a lot of characters, and stuff around the characters, including a lot of character background and varieties. Gene Hackman's character of Rev. Scott may be a turn to what viewers expect from a hero, and that's why he's great. The other characters, although somewhat stereotypical, are very convincing. Now just add a disaster background of a capsized cruise liner and you get a disaster movie that's a lot of fun. Nowadays, ""Poseidon"" may be considered ""campy"", or such. But really, it isn't. This movie has so much likable qualities. It has this nostalgic feel in it, that I find very enjoyable and wonderful.""The Poseidon Adventure"" was released at the time that disaster movies were king of the cinema, or maybe this made it become the king. After ""Airport"" was released previously, it earned a lot of bucks from the box-office, but was savaged by critics when it was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Picture. ""Poseidon"" wasn't nominated for Best Picture, but I think it would be more of a better qualification. Now, I haven't seen ""Airport"" yet, but after seeing a couple of trailers and so, I think this was more entertaining. It was more interesting, I think, and more action-packed for its time. It also, of course, has more body-count, and drama to go around it. I think this certain thing is, let's say, the top of every disaster films, and makes them entertaining. Surely enough, it's very interesting to see a well-respected all-star cast, caught in a major calamity, and escaping them with rewards (they get passed dangerous obstacles) and loses (some of them don't really make it, of course).I think that ""Poseidon"" was superbly entertaining, and, done with right justice on DVD, think this would still be very effective now. It may lose some of the charm, but this film would still have a special place in my heart, and may movie collection. I think similar to anyone else.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The Poseidon Adventure
68,gftbiloxi,Hell Upside Down: A Classic of it's Kind,8,11 June 2007,"Today it seems that every third movie leans on CGI to a point at which the term ""special effects"" has little meaning--but there was a time, and not so very long ago, when the words had a very literal meaning. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, loosely based on the novel by Paul Gallico, was very special indeed. So much so that it was not simply a movie. It was an event.The film's fame is such that the story is extremely well known. An aging passenger liner, the Poseidon, is making a final voyage at an unsafe speed and with insufficient ballast. Shortly after midnight on New Year's Eve it encounters a ninety foot tidal wave and capsizes, leaving a handful of survivors to fight their way to the only point in the hull from which rescue might come.The opening sections of the film, during which we meet various passengers, was filmed aboard the Queen Mary. Once we enter the Grand Salon for New Year's Eve festivities, however, every set has been constructed to full size. There are no CGI effects, no rear projections, and (with the exception of long shots of the ship itself) there are no miniatures. The cast works exclusively in the middle of tangible effects, and then as now, the result is remarkably disturbing. It looks real because it is real.And it is really that sense of reality that puts THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE at the forefront of its genre. Disaster films have been popular since the silent era, but THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was virtually without precedent in 1972. It is difficult to convey the visual shock the film had in its first theatrical release. People screamed and jolted in their seats, and when the ship capsized the entire audience leaned to the right, clutching at their arm rests and each other. You left the theatre physically drained, your conversation laced with nervous laughter.It is true that the film's dialogue is more than a little corny, but this was indeed made at a time when children still said 'No, Sir' and 'Yes, Ma'am;' the film reflects its era, and many viewers were as shocked by the profanity as they were by the special effects. But whatever the film's shortcomings in terms of dialogue, there can no dispute about the plot: this is one movie that really moves, and with such speed and logic that you can barely catch your breath.The cast reads very much like a Who's Who of acclaimed actors of the day. Leading man Gene Hackman was fresh from his Oscar-winning performance in THE FRENCH CONNECTION. Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, and Red Buttons were all former Oscar winners. Carol Lynley received heavy-weight critical acclaim in earlier films and Stella Stevens was the popular star of many light comedies--and gave the performance of career when she stood her image on its head. Jack Albertson and Roddy McDowell were noted character actors, and even comparatively minor roles such as the ship's captain and chaplain went to such notables as Leslie Neilson and Arthur O'Connell. Together they make the unlikely nature of the story seem entirely plausible.The recently released ""Special Edition"" DVD cannot, sadly, compensate for the loss of the big screen--but that aside it is really quite fine. The print is virtually pristine, and while the sound is a bit lacking it is solid enough to make me wonder at those who complain. The bonus material is also very good, including considerable ""Making Of"" information, brief interviews with surviving members of the cast, thoughts about iconographic subtext, and story board samples. The commentary track by director Ronald Neame is both informative and entertaining, and while the commentary track by Carol Lynley, Stella Stevens, and Pamela Sue Martin is somewhat spotty it is enjoyable none the less. Recommended as a classic of its kind.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",The Poseidon Adventure
69,CharltonBoy,I Cant go overboard on this film.,6,25 December 2001,I remember watching The Poseidon Adventure a couple of times when i was a kid growing up in the seventies and i remember it as a superb action movie. Time is not always good to movies and it hasnt been to kind to this. The film has dated a lot and when i was a kid i remember this being very exciting.......not now. The acting seems over the top and some of the decisions made by the survivors seem stupid. I love most most movies with Gene Hackman in but this is not one of his best although the performance from Shelly Winters is good. Nostalga is not all it's cracked up to be. 6 out of 10.,The Poseidon Adventure
70,TOMASBBloodhound,They remade this? Well of course they did!,5,28 June 2012,"You know Hollywood is getting desperate when mediocre disaster films like the The Poseidon Adventure are getting remade. I've not seen the remake, but I've seen the box office figures and they're not pretty. It barely made 1/3 of what it cost to make! Yikes! The original, after years of availability on the small screen, has actually become a marginal success. It is a typical disaster flick full of stereotypical characters and situations, but there's no doubting the film's star power and intentions. Gene Hackman's performance almost saves the film.The plot involves a luxurious ocean liner (The Poseidon) which is turned upside down by a large rogue wave. Most of the passengers and crew perish while a crafty young minister (Hackman) leads a small band of survivors up through the bottom of the ship and hopefully to the chance at a rescue. Making their way through the over-turned ship is difficult enough, but it proves just as difficult for the young preacher to keep everyone's spirits up and convince them to keep following him toward the engine room in the midst of one hardship after another. The film becomes a testament to not giving up in the face of tough odds and the loss of loved ones. The film, through Hackman's character, is simply reminding the audience to ""keep the faith"".Though the f/x of the 1970s were nothing like what we have today, the film looks decent enough. The upside-down sets look like they were a chore to design, but they appear detailed. Nothing really looks completely hokey or cheap. It looks like this would have been a physically taxing shoot for all of the actors involved.Problems arise from the script, however. The tone of the film once the ship is turned over is wildly inconsistent. One moment will have characters tenderly encouraging each other that life is still worth living. The next moment will feature cast members shouting at one another in furious fits of over-acting. All this while the water level and possibility of death is rising higher and higher. Cast members die off in a mostly predictable order. When it's all said and done, Hackman's performance and some neat sets are really all this film can hang its hat on. One wonders why anyone thought to spend so much money remaking this film.5 of 10 stars.",The Poseidon Adventure
71,gab-14712,Very Fun!,9,18 October 2017,"The 1970's is the decade that gave birth to the disaster movie genre. In my review of 1970's Airport, I pointed out how that movie gave birth to disaster movies of that decade which in turn spawned disaster blockbusters of today's age. These kind of movies are meant to be dumb, silly fun and the makers of these kind of movies embrace what these movies are meant to do: to entertain. You won't be getting any thespian acting or a serious melodrama. Instead you'll get an onslaught of special effects and a thin story usually about trying to survive and that is quite okay by me. Another early example of a rather entertaining disaster film is 1972's The Poseidon Adventure. I enjoyed the film for what it was. It has a big cast of former Oscar winners and big-name movie stars, and they all seemed to have a grand ol' time. Sure, the dialogue is cheesy sometimes but the action is what we are here to see. And in that regard, the movie clearly succeeds.The plot remains simple and for good measure. The basic setup for the story is that a disaster strikes and the survivors must reach for safety. In this case, there is this passenger ship called the S.S Poseidon (loosely modeled after The Queen Mary) going on its last cruise before it reaches retirement. Out of nowhere, a large tidal wave hits the ship and turns the boat upside down. Now with everything in reverse, the survivors of the ship led by minister Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) must climb to the now-uprooted bottom of the boat if they have any chance of escaping. See, this is a simple story but its a fun story regardless.Ah, let's talk about our characters. This movie is based off the best-selling novel written by Paul Gallico, and rumor has it that the characters are unlikable in the novel. Some of the characters are unlikeable in the film, but screenwriters Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes and seasoned British director Ronald Neame did a solid job in tweaking some characters as to make them more sympathetic. Now, all the characters do what you expect them to do in this type of movie, so expect no surprises. The character development was rather surprisingly strong for some characters. As for the acting, no one gives a career-defining performance but everyone does a solid job. Gene Hackman as Reverend Scott and Ernest Borgnine as Rogo are arguably the two leads. They had a fun time, but they may have overacted especially in Borgnine's case. Those facial expressions and the way he delivered the lines were cheesy, but fun. Check out the rest of this cast: Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelley Winters (who delivers a fantastic performance), Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, Leslie Nielsen, etc. That is one heck of a cast.We don't see these movies for the performances, but rather for the special effects. It was amazing what this film was able to do with practical effects. The big tsunami wave that overturned a boat looked mightily impressive for a 1972 movie, but in reality it was just a large wave filmed in slow-motion off the coast of California. The production design was immense and the I love the way we see the capsized boat. Keep in mind the film was release before computers played a role in effects, which makes this movie even more impressive. If there is one thing I absolutely love, it's the way how the movie looked and sounded and how the visual effects were implemented in the movie.Another thing I liked very much is the score and the music. This film was composed by the young maestro, John Williams. Williams would eventually become a film legend with all the famous films he would score, but this is the movie that got him his big break. Some people go as far to call this his best score ever. I wouldn't go that far, but it's high on my list. The overall tone of the score is dark, but the theme is rather light and there is something about it that makes it special.When originally released, The Poseidon Adventure received good reviews with lots of praise going for the visual effects-and rightfully so. Of course this film is a blockbuster and not meant for any award recognition, but somehow it received nine Oscar nominations mostly on the technical side though.

73,FilmOtaku,Not as cheesy as I thought it would be,6,9 December 2003,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of those films I'd always meant to watch but never got around to.  Starring a `Who's Who' of prolific 1950's-1970's actors, (Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine & Gene Hackman) it was pretty much the disaster film that started the trend of that decade. The plot is simple:  An enormous wave capsizes an ocean liner, killing all but a handful of passengers who must now climb their way up to the bottom of the ship if they have any hope of rescue.This was an action/suspense film that didn't try to be anything else.  There was really no back story and no character development  when someone died, the viewer's level of shock or sadness can pretty much only be gauged by the amount of time they had spent in the film at that point.   Some of the sets were kind of cheesy looking, but I can forgive that based on the genre. Most importantly, it did what suspense/action films *should* do, and that is move along at a good pace.  I cannot think of an instance where I noticed a lag in the pacing. All told, The Poseidon Adventure is a decent film  certainly not anything poignant or profound, but a good action flick with some great scene chewing by Hackman and an opportunity to see an ultra-buff Borgnine in action.--Shelly",The Poseidon Adventure

75,RonellSowes,Best Of Its Type,7,4 March 2021,"A wave from an earthquake turns a cruise ship upside down and nine passengers band together to find a way out.
The film introduces all the future members in the opening minutes of the film which include: the leader who is an unorthodox preacher(Hackman), a detective (Borgnine) and his wife(Stevens), a retired grandmother(Winters) and her husband, a waiter on the ship(McDowell), an odd bachelor, a singer for the ship and a young boy traveling with his sister. The band of survivors is made up of many strong actors/actresses, as you might notice, who are instrumental for this film to work. Gene Hackman, who was at the peak of his career, is the lead while Ernest Borgnine plays a role similar to that of his character in the film. Second fiddle, but always reminding you he's there and fully capable of taking charge. He also happens to be the only truly intresting one left standing as Hackman, Stevens, Winters and McDowell's characters all perish in the course of the journey.Like many disaster movies, the film is a little melodramatic and soapy at times. Mostly before the ship is capsized and the adventure starts, after that it definetly tightens up. It takes just enough time for the audience to get familiar with the characters before it gets started with the actual story. The plot is fairly simple: the group must work their way up to the engine room where the metal is thinnest. The trick is in the getting there. The film consistently brings up one obstacle after another and never bothers to stagnate.
The Poseidon Adventure manages to keep the intensity and action going for nearly the entirety of its 117 minute runtime. And at the end, you might look back and wonder how it managed to hold your interest with such a simple premise-especially when you think of the dismal 2006 remake. I suppose quality filmmaking from all angles is the answer.",The Poseidon Adventure

I actually bought into the illusion that this diverse group of people was living this unreal harrowing experience. I remember my theater instructor said this film makes a statement about which people deserve to survive and thereby reproduce. Without being politically incorrect here, he said to analyze the different criteria we use to classify people and see which of these criteria can be applied to the survivors.

Then there are the obvious religious undertones of a preacher leading a group up to salvation. Add in some pathetic special effects, a limp script, and a lack of humor and you have one dated, depressing movie.

80,Isaac5855,"Forget 30 years and two remakes, this still stands as the ultimate disaster film...",8,20 March 2007,"Thirty years and two remakes have not diminished the quality of 1972's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE an exciting and emotionally charged actioner that initiated a new genre of movie-making in the 70's known as the ""disaster"" film. The film follows what happens when an ocean liner is capsized by a 90 foot tidal wave, turned completely upside down, and follows the handful of survivors who try to get the bottom (or top) of the ship before it sinks completely. Maybe the special effects look cheap compared to the effects in the remakes, but what this movie has that the remakes lack is heart and characters you care about: Gene Hackman as the priest doubting his faith Ernest Borgnine as the cop married to ex-prostie Stella Stevens; Red Buttons as the lonely haberdasher; Caroly Lynley as the emotionally distraught lounge singer; Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters as the aging Jewish couple en route to meet their grandchild for the first time; Pamela Sue Martin and Christopher Shea as the brother and sister en route to a reunion with their parents. Irwin Allen somehow has managed to make an exciting film rich with characters you come to care about and make you hope for them to come out of this alive. Many have tried to duplicate and imitate, but this is the granddaddy of them all that is still as fun to get wrapped up in as it was 25 years ago.",The Poseidon Adventure
81,virek213,Bottom Looks Like Up,8,25 January 2012,"Although it wasn't a very long-lived (let alone highly praised) genre, the disaster film was a prominent phenomenon on the Hollywood scene during a fair chunk of the 1970s (and would be revived again in the closing years of the 20th century and on into the 21st). The standard line about disaster films is that involved a large group of people, usually big-name stars, caught up in either a natural or man-made cataclysm who must do everything they can to survive. And during the 1970s, no one in Hollywood personified this peculiar genre more than producer Irwin Allen. While he had been known during the 1960s for such TV sci-fi series as ""Time Tunnel"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"", it was in the following decade that he became known as the Master Of Disaster. And it was with his 1972 production THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE that he earned that nickname.The situation involves the aging steamship liner S.S. ""Poseidon"" on its final voyage from New York to Athens as New Year's Eve approaches. They have managed to navigate through a severe storm on the Mediterranean Sea, but the ship's new owner's representative (Fred Sadoff) then forces the captain (Leslie Nielsen) to order a full-ahead on the ship's speed, even though not enough ballast has been taken on to allow it to proceed safely. This proves to be its undoing, as a severe earthquake in the sea off of Crete has just generated a massive tsunami. At one minute past midnight on New Year's Eve, that tsunami nails the ""Poseidon""; and the all-star cast inside the ship's main lounge finds the world going upside down as the wave turns the ship completely over. Many of the survivors still hold out hope for Nielsen and the crew to save them, but those hopes turn out to be totally unrealistic as the sea pours right in on them. However, one group of survivors, led by a very rebellious priest (Gene Hackman), has made a determined effort to get up towards the hull of the overturned liner. Even that is not without its complications, as Hackman frequently must put up with the belligerence of a New York cop (Ernest Borgnine) who isn't convinced of the validity of Hackman's plan. Even as they make their way slowly but surely through the ship's interior, every deck of the ship behind them keeps getting flooded; and they pass another group of survivors heading for the ship's bow (an unwise move, as the bow turns out to be under the water by that point). It becomes a struggle, as they are reduced to only six by the time everything is settled.By 21st century standards, notably when compared to films like 1997's TITANIC or 2008's POSEIDON (the latter of which is basically a reworking of this film), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is admittedly dated. The soap opera theatrics that were such a part of the genre in its 1970s incarnation are very much in evidence here, accompanied by some overacting a bit too much shouting on the parts of Hackman and Borgnine, who are otherwise quite good. And there are liable to be a lot of people who will point out that the special effects, which gave this film one of its two Oscar wins (the other was for Best Song, ""The Morning After""), are now painfully old-fashioned in the wake of CGI. And yet this film, for whatever flaws it may have, and however predictable the death scenes may be, still packs a sizable punch in terms of tension and suspense; and John Williams' score presages some of the things he'd later do for JAWS and JAWS 2. The cast includes, among others, Pamela Sue Martin, Carol Lynley, Eric O'Shea, and Arthur O'Connell, all of whom are fairly well directed by Englishman Ronald Neame, whose previous credits had included 1966's A MAN COULD GET KILLED, and GAMBIT. Credit should still also go to effects masters L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers for their work, which still holds up fairly well to scrutiny, especially once one accepts the effects for what they were at the time.Few critics have ever given the disaster film genre the time of day; and fewer still have any patience anymore for a film like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. That being said, however, it manages to deliver a lot in two hours for a $5 million cost; and given that so many 21st century spectacles cost forty times that much with less real substance, that is still quite an accomplishment.",The Poseidon Adventure

The plotting is a little too straightforward and the melodrama is bumpy. Still, you gotta love can't-fail actor Gene Hackman, and it's nice to see Ernest Borgnine, whose career I mostly missed.

84,jhaggardjr,Excellent disaster flick,9,15 July 2000,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an above average disaster film from Irwin Allen, who eventually became known as the Master of Disaster after this came out in 1972. This was the movie that started the disaster film craze of the 70s, and deservedly so. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is about a luxury liner traveling the open seas on New Year's Eve that has the unfortunate task of running into a 90 foot tidal wave that proceeds to capsize the ship and turn it upside down thanks to an undersea earthquake. Afterwards a small group of survivors try to make it to the top (or bottom) of the ship hoping to be rescued. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" starts off as a silly comedy for the first 20 minutes, where they introduce the main characters. These characters are portrayed by an all-star cast: Gene Hackman as a reverend who's always barking orders at everyone; Ernest Borgnine as a cop who always complaining about everything; Stella Stevens as Borgnine's wife, a former prostitute; Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson as a Jewish couple; Red Buttons as a lonely bachelor; Carol Lynley as the ship's pop singer; and Leslie Nielsen as the ship's captain. After the opening 20 minutes the real excitement begins. The passengers have to endure many dangers while trying to escape, and during the course of the film the real question is the same as it is in every disaster picture: who will die and who will survive? I won't dare say who dies and who survives. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an excellent movie for most of its two hours, and I enjoyed the action, special effects, and the performances (which are terrific). Sure Borgnine has the worst written role in the film, but so what. He'll either make you laugh or get on your nerves. I felt a little of both. Same goes for Stevens who is a good foil for Borgnine. Hackman plays the reverend to the hilt, a man who won't let anyone give up. Winters is very funny as the Jewish woman who worries she won't make it because she's overweight, and Albertson plays off of her very well as her husband. Buttons is very good as the bachelor who's sweet and caring. Lynley gets to show off some singing talents, and does a decent job of singing as she does at trying to escape from hell upside down. Nielsen is a lot of fun to watch as he plays it deadly straight here long before playing it deadly straight in ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" comedies. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is pure adventure indeed. Terrific entertainment.

86,majikstl,Unsinkable ....,10,19 May 2006,"Every so often over the years, I have found myself in a room -- at a doctor's office, the auditorium where I had my high school graduation, even in a church during a funeral -- and I find my mind wandering and wondering about what it would be like should the entire place turn upside down. Where would I land, which heavy object would I have to dodge to keep from being squashed, etc. Such is the power of movies; they have the ability to alter perspective, not in some deeply profound way; but with the subtle way you perceive the world.My upside down view of the world is an outgrowth from having seen THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE dozens of times over the years and gotten a kick out of the moment on New Year's Eve when the entire boat capsizes and everyone goes head over heels. The movie took something readily recognizable and made it fascinating just by flipping it over.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the first and the best of the so-called disaster movies of the 1970s. Okay, the original AIRPORT and long before that 1939s SAN FRANCISCO were first, but the airborne disaster in one and the earthquake in the other were mere threads in rambling soap operas; POSEIDON was the first where the catastrophe was the focal point and the starting point. As such, producer Irwin Allen was mining new territory and essentially created the genre -- though its value as a cinematic art is certainly debatable.Anyway, I think that the original POSEIDON works, where so many of those that followed didn't, because it has a sense of humor. Certainly, while many imitators (EARTHQUAKE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, POSEIDON's two woeful remakes, etc.) were laughable, they weren't humorous in a humane sort of way. The film recognizes that its basic premise is absurd, but doesn't dwell on it, placing the emphasis on the people not the situation.The disaster movie became quickly known as a vehicle where stick-figure characters, burdened with cumbersome and melodramatic backstories and played by big-name stars shamelessly emoting all over the place, bided their time as the impending doom of the special effects polished them off one by one. As such, the disaster became the star, not unlike Freddie Krueger or Michael Meyers or other horror movie boogie men; and the point of the film was less about survival than about not surviving, about how and when the special effects and the stunt team would give which character the next big adios.You'd be hard pressed to remember, let alone care, who played what character in EARTHQUAKE or THE SWARM or AIRPORT 19-whatever. That's the beauty of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE; even if you think the characters are caricatures, their backstories lame and the whole film silly, they nonetheless stick with you. Part of this is due, I think, to the fact that the characters are more real; there are no multimillionaire industrialists, no fading movie stars, no international terrorists or jewel thieves, no phoney-baloney VIPs of any sort. The final voyage of the SS Poseidon carries a rather mundane passenger list of tourists, honeymooners, doting grandparents and lonely singles. They're ordinary people who end up in extraordinary circumstances. Likewise, the cast is made up of ordinary movie stars; none of the cast (with the notable exception of star Gene Hackman, hot off his success in THE FRENCH CONNECTION) were at the height of their careers, but they are an immensely likable ensemble of recognizable character actors; Red Button, Roddy MacDowall, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, Arthur O'Connell, etc. They are performers who the audience is so comfortable with that you instantly are concerned for their safety. Bigger stars might have overwhelmed the story, like in THE TOWERING INFERNO or EARTHQUAKE; but here, if you don't like Shelley, you just might identify with her character. Bottom line: you really do care who survives and you are hurt when so-and-so meets his unexpected and untimely end.Even Hackman manages to be larger than life and yet rather ordinary as the movie hero. Though he plays a minister -- in itself an odd choice for an action hero -- his Rev. Scott is something of a rebel, an outspoken, liberal cleric, like those who popped up during the antiwar movement of the 60s. Instead of the icy, grim hero of most of these films, as the story's Christ's figure, Hackman's Scott is guided as much by his emotions as by his self-righteousness. He's certainly no Charlton Heston -- and that is just fine. Through Scott, the film delivers a fiery sermon that puts a strange spin on the usual Darwinism that rules this type of film. While the film pays due respect to the old ""it's God's will"" style of religion as embodied in Arthur O'Connell's Chaplain John, the main message of POSEIDON is that of self confidence and self-determination. Darwin's survival of the fittest ideology is not seen as a contradiction to the theology of ""the meek shall inherit;"" -- perhaps suggesting that the meek must survive in order to inherit.Though not handled with very much grace, the film's religious themes nonetheless give THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE a bit of backbone; arguing that religion without action is futile and that one of God's greatest gifts is the will to survive.As an action machine, POSEIDON hasn't aged all that well; it's special effects and production values now seem sort of quaint. Yet, at the same time, these things give it a bit of character, a remembrance of when drama was defined by a good cast, an intriguing story and a sense of adventure, not just by how cleverly a CGI technician can manipulate images. Like the ship itself, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE may be a fine lady that's seen better days, but unlike the ship in question, it seems to sail on and on, seemingly unsinkable.",The Poseidon Adventure

Along the way they run into obstacles that test their strength, their courage, and overall their willingness to survive as a team. The Poseidon Adventure is a movie that I saw for the first time on TV when I was 8, and I've watched it every time it was on, I rented it both from the library and the video store, and I finally bought it. I never get bored of it. Every time I watch it, it's like I'm seeing it for the first time. My enjoyment of it never decreases. There are several reasons for it being a good movie.The acting is amazing. Is there a bad actor in this movie at all? No. Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens...All capable and very good actors, together in one movie. Everybody plays their role with the best of their skill. There's really not one bad performance in the movie. Pre-comedy Leslie Nielsen even does well in his small role as the captain of the Poseidon. Since it's a 70's movie, some lines of dialogue sound really corny, but they end up being the film's most memorable lines.The special effects are pretty good. The upside down sets are really cool, and the underwater shots are well done even though we know it's a model ship. The capsizing scene is amazing and looks as if it's actually happening. Irwin Allen wanted everything as perfect as he could get it, so the actors performed their own stunts, and the actors said it was the most difficult shoot of their lives. What I like the best about this movie is what was missing in the 2006 remake. Character development. Before the action starts, we are introduced to each character and taught who they are, what they're like, why they're like that, etc. The new Poseidon is missing that, and it's a mistake.The Poseidon Adventure is the first real Hollywood disaster film if you don't count Airport, and it's still the best to this day.

91,mnpollio,All star disaster epic not aging well,6,4 February 2011,"The 1970s was chock full of disaster epics and probably the best of them was one of the earliest - The Poseidon Adventure. The action focuses on the Poseidon, a cruise ship hit and capsized by a rogue wave. With up now down and vice versa, a rag-tag band of survivors, led by embittered former preacher Gene Hackman, attempt to make their way to the top (bottom) of the ship to hopefully meet a rescue party.One of the biggest problems with the film is that the once impressive visual effects are now almost laughable. The moment where the wave hits the ship and unleashes disaster comes across as quaint rather than especially impressive. This was the area in which the inferior remake actually overtook its predecessor. Watching a group of extras slide across the floor and then fall through plate glass in painfully choreographed scenes seems oddly mundane.Unlike the remake, however, the film actually does manage to sustain interest after the wave hits. There is certainly a grand guilty pleasure watching the eclectic all-star cast trudge its way towards either their doom or rescue. While the characters are paper thin types and fail to generate any emotional attachment, one cannot accuse the cast of sitting on their laurels. They cry, sputter, swim and have hysterics with the best of them. It is not their fault that what passes for character development is so flaccid and that each death is anticipated only with mild interest rather than genuine concern. The suspense lies far more in wondering who among the familiar faces will be next to meet the Grim Reaper than in any particular action set piece.Of the cast, undoubtedly the best performance (and the most well known) comes courtesy of Shelly Winters, as an aged Jewish grandmother and former swimmer. You just know that swimming background is going to come in handy and give her a BIG scene and neither Winters or the film disappoints on that front. Gene Hackman is also first-rate as the strong-willed lapsed preacher who leads the survivors. Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens are a bit too over-the-top as a vacationing police officer and his former prostitute wife. Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea bring the newcomer/youth element as a brother and sister en route to their parents. Blink and you might miss Roddy McDowell as a waiter and Leslie Nielsen as the captain. The worst performance is arguably by Carol Lynley as the ship's wimpy singer, who basically acts catatonic and gets dragged around by a too-old-for-her Red Buttons.The pace never really lags, but the film does have its share of sluggish spots - it never really has another truly exciting moment after the capsizing of the boat. The film is definitely showing its age, so it works best being viewed through the filter of the past.",The Poseidon Adventure

The only characters I cared for were Acres, Linda, Rev. Scott and the Rosens. The other ones annoyed me to no-end, especially Nonnie the retard (I want to see other Carol Lynley movies to see if she's always that awful - was her acting any wooden I'd have called her Pinocchio), Robin the know-it-all (that kid is nothing but annoying), his stupid sister (I would've let her throw herself into the fire) and Rogo the idiot killer (God, is Ernest Borgnine awful in this one). Did all the cast forget how to act? And, does anyone think that the script is truly horrible? I was yawning in the big 'climb-the-tree' scene. And LAUGHING at Gene's acting. For God's Sake, was the script so bad he couldn't make it believable? Sure it was. But the thing that saddened me the most was that Mrs. Rosen's death scene was idiotic. 3, 2, 1, bring your hand to your chest, scream and then fall... it was bloody obvious it was staged.Bottom line: 'The Poseidon Adventure' is the worst disaster movie ever.

94,antagonist117,"Predictable and macho, but with some fun supporting roles",4,19 July 2013,"There is a moment soon after the capsizing of the good ship Poseidon when the movie seems on the verge of subverting expectations or at least complicating its message. Gene Hackman, playing a brash, new-age preacher who has recently given a sermon to the effect that God helps those who helps themselves, is conversing with an older, traditionalist priest in the ship's ruined ballroom. The older priest is comforting the wounded, the old, and the dying: people who cannot make it out. Hackman tries to get the priest to come with him and a handful of other survivors, saying that in flight there is hope, while those left behind will meet certain death. The priest replies that Hackman's God is the God of the strong, but for his part he will not abandon the weak. It is a moving moment, and one that almost gives Hackman's character pause... but no. This kind of flick rewards strength, and pities and punishes weakness. Hackman declares with unshakeable confidence that the masses are doomed unless they follow his lead, and of course he is right because he speaks with the most authority. From this moment onward the movie follows the most predictable path toward the most predictable ends. Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, Jack Albertson, and an against-type Leslie Nielson bring some likability to the proceedings, just enough to make the movie watchable.",The Poseidon Adventure

The Poseidon Adventure is both scary and the affects are amazing, plus the acting is very good. Gene Hackman who is in my opinion a very overrated actor gives what is maybe his best performance in what if you had to make a choice on who the lead is would be it, but it is the amazing Shelley Winters that is the standout. She is wonderful in her roll as a fat older woman who is going to visit her new grandchild for the first time. The direction is also fine but it is the visual affects that will awe you.

The acting is good enough to make you care about the characters, and to feel anger when they do something stupid, and pain when they die because of their stubbornness or bravery.I can't give this movie any more than a 7 because it borders on camp in places, and is too dark to see in others, but it is still a very enjoyable, riveting movie.",The Poseidon Adventure

98,Mitch-38,The Love Boat From Hell,7,5 March 2001,"The film that set the early 1970's stage for practically a whole genre of ""disaster movies"" (aside from AIRPORT in 1970). Yes, the initial prologue and set up is rather inane, yet we grow to appreciate and care for these characters. Flashing back to when this was a new release, this had as much buzz going as TITANIC. You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing ""THE MORNING AFTER"" being played. I just about drove my mum off the deep end ""filming"" a THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, with her Kodak super-8 camera. It starred all of us kids in the neighborhood, and I turned the house topsy-turvy to get that perfect ""upside down"" look. It's a wonder she didn't end up in a straightjacket on that one. Anyone in possession of those reels could own my home via extortion.    The nucleus of the film, of course, is mega-wave capsizes the SS POSEIDON. Passengers make their attempts to survive and escape the ship, if possible. The acting gets a little heavy at places, yet we are swept up into the saga. Anything that we're not alienated or disenfranchised from, is bound to win us over to a certain degree. You can't help but get involved in their struggle. The script dawdles here an there, however, it's a well above average movie.         Special kudos for Red Buttons, who does turn in an understated performance, and shines superbly.

Then, like now, I will still tune in and watch, if only to see the capsizing of the boat and our rag tag troop climb up the giant Christmas tree. Many a day I ""played"" The Poseidon Adventure in our basement, turning furniture upside down and being trapped!

100,Casey-52,The #1 70s disaster movie that started it all,9,15 August 2000,"The 1970's were the heyday of disaster films and this was one of the better ones. An overacting all-star cast graced the screen in all of them. THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE was the very first big-budget moneymaker that spawned a whole slew of knock-offs involving tidal waves, fires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and volcanoes. It is also arguably the best. Producer Irwin Allen was the mastermind behind most of them, known for spending millions of dollars on special effects and his big-name stars.A simple plot: a tidal wave knocks a ship upside down and a handful of survivors have to climb to the bottom of the ship at the surface before the ship sinks. They are led by a fanatical preacher (Gene Hackman) who conflicts with an ex-cop (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-hooker wife (Stella Stevens). Jack Albertson (WILLY WONKA) and Shelley Winters are an elderly Jewish couple who are on their way to see their new grandchild. Pamela Sue Martin (TV's Nancy Drew) and Eric Shea (like Bobby Brady, but more annoying) are brother and sister on their way to meet their parents. Roddy McDowall (a fantastic actor) is wasted as a ship hand who dies rather quick. Red Buttons (PETE'S DRAGON) is an elderly gentleman who helps the ship's lounge singer (Carol Lynley) retain her sanity. Arthur O'Connell is a strict reverend who refuses to go along with Hackman. Leslie Nielsen makes a cameo as the ship's captain who dies during the tidal wave.The cast really isn't very important, it's the special effects and on-going tension that makes the film so much fun. I absolutely love the claustrophobic and wet feeling that is so important to the execution of the film. While a lot of the acting hasn't aged well (Shelley Winters, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine are especially guilty of overacting!), the special effects aren't too cheesy and the entire set of the ship is wonderfully well-made, still standing as an achievement on its own. Lots of unintentional humor abounds (the obese Shelley Winters swimming underwater, displaying her underpants clinging to her bulbous buttocks), which makes the viewing experience all the more enjoyable. The theme song, ""The Morning After"", won an Oscar and is rather lightweight, but highly listenable.THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE definitely does have some twists and turns that surprise the viewer (not everyone gets out alive) and holds the audience's attention throughout the entire thing, even though things do get a little soap opera-ish at times. This makes a great double bill with THE TOWERING INFERNO, which I find a better picture, but POSEIDON is a very fun viewing and is, if anything, a great movie to watch if you have 2 hours to kill.",The Poseidon Adventure
101,ryangilmer007,disaster film galore,6,15 March 1999,"One of the best movies from the short lived disaster film genre era. (Of course most of the films in this genre turn out to be a disaster).  The movie starts out slowly and wastes some of the talents of its plethora of stars (ie Leslie Neilson).  But once it gets going at midnight on New Year's Eve when the S.S. Poseidon is struck by a huge tidal-wave and is capsized, the movie is interesting to follow.  Reverend Scott (Gene Hackman) leads nine Survivors; including an elderly couple,a detective, an ex-prostitute wife, waiter, and young siblings.  Character depth is of course un-needed as some of the survivors die somewhat predictable deaths.  They battle steam, fire, rising water, and each other in a battle to the bottom/top of the ship.

Their losses become your losses. Right up to the end, you feel their plight and are fighting for each and every one of them.This is completely different from today's bloodless Disaster Movies like ""2012"" that have tons of disaster, tons of deaths, but you are never exposed to a single one of them. It's like you're playing a video game, get killed and get to resume play, without a thought of what just happened. This extends to today's action films like ""Man of Steel"" where tons of people must be getting killed, but you're not allowed to get anywhere near feeling a thing about it.""The Poseidon Adventure"" even goes far beyond Producer Irwin Allen's other films like ""The Towering Inferno."" There, and in his other films, it's just lots of chaos without connection to the characters. Credit for ""The Poseidon Adventure""s success goes to Director Ronald Neame, Screenwriter Sterling Silliphant, and source novelist Paul Gallico. The acting by the all-star cast is excellent across the board.Supporting the film is John Williams' film score, Harold E.

In it, on New Year's Eve, a ship captained by Leslie Nielson is turned upside down by a rogue tidal wave which kills most of the extras. Nearly everyone The star-studded cast of survivors must climb up the ship before it sinks entirely and must undergo some terrifying risks to survive. I'm not saying this is any kind of masterpiece. Most of the story isn't hugely believable, but it's plausible and entertaining, thanks to the solid special effects, talented actors, and the enthusiasm that went into the project.

105,ScottAmundsen,A Rare Instance Where the Movie is Better than the Book,10,8 December 2011,"Credit for the ""disaster movie"" craze of the Seventies is often given to AIRPORT, a very good film that has a disaster in it, but the disaster is tangential to the plot rather than its center. It was not until two years later that the real granddaddy of the disaster genre was released: Ronald Neame's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, based on Paul Gallico's bestselling novel and one of those rare occasions where the film actually outshines the book.The film actually follows Gallico's novel fairly straightforwardly; the primary difference is in the characters. Gallico's dramatis personae are a bunch of people so unlikable that I found myself wishing the damn ship would just sink and take them all to the bottom.The movie's screenplay, by Stirling Silliphant and Wendell Mayes, softens the characterizations considerably, humanizing them to a great degree and allowing Neame and his brilliant star-studded cast to strut their stuff, from Stella Stevens's funny-sad floosie to Ernest Borgnine's hard-nosed cop whose weakness is his wife (Stevens), from Gene Hackman as a rah-rah football star-cum-minister, to Jack Albertson and Shelley Winters, heartbreaking as a Jewish couple on their way to Israel to see their grandson for the first time.High art this isn't, I'll admit that. The acting is hammy in spots (Borgnine in particular is allowed to overplay almost every scene), but somehow it works here. Neame has a good grasp of the material he is working with; the book was a potboiler, a soap opera on the high seas, and he filmed it accordingly.Winters received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Albertson was easily her equal and should have been nominated in the Supporting Actor category but the Academy is notoriously fickle about these things.The most impressive thing about this movie, and the thing that sets it apart from more recent epics such as James Cameron's TITANIC, is that they did not have CGI technology in the early Seventies; everything you see was filmed on a set that had to be built with actors who probably spent all day in the water for weeks on end. What visual effects may have gained with the advent of computer technology, something was lost along the way; a certain verisimilitude that somehow looks more real than the sleek CGI stuff.I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a kid of nine; despite the slight cheesiness of the proceedings, I give it a ten because, as the saying goes, ""they don't make movies like this anymore."" And it is true. Two remakes were made of this one, and from what I heard (I refuse to see them), they sank faster than the ship did.Pass the popcorn.",The Poseidon Adventure

107,xbrad68,GENE HACKMANS performance makes the movie worthwhile.,10,13 June 2004,THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is a worthwhile movie mostly because of GENEHACKMANS performance as the Reverand. The script about a ship turnedupside down and the struggle of the passengers to reach safety is exciting.Ernest Borgnine is quite good as the police Lieutenant. You get the feeling that the passengers in the story will be alright because there are people used toleadership like the police Lieutenant. The special effects look fine after over 30 years. The fact that there is a THX version of the movie available is appealing. Some of the damsel in distress stuff seems a little sexist today. The film inspires you to think about humans surviving underwater for long periods of time. If the human species is to survive alien contact we may have to learn to liveunderwater for years at a time. I gave the POSEIDON ADVENTURE a 10 out of10 because of the cliffhanger script and great acting.,The Poseidon Adventure
108,possumopossum,The Other Great Disaster Film,9,21 June 2007,"The other one was the original AIRPORT. As I said before, this is a genre that ended up caricaturing itself, and the two great movies that spawned it got a bad reputation because of it. This movie, along with its predecessor AIRPORT did not deserve its bad press. This movie took its time in telling the story and gave you a chance to know the characters so that you cared what happened to them. That is something, from what I heard, that Wolfgang Petersen's remake failed at miserably. I'm glad I didn't see it.I spotted a lot of religious symbolism in this movie. A ship turned upside down meaning a world turned upside down and everyone who tries to follow the way to life is mocked and scorned. Interesting that the one who tried to lead a handful of people to life was a rebellious priest. Also, the standing up of the Christmas tree conjured up an interesting image. Seeing Rev. Scott shouldering the tree looked a lot to me like Jesus carrying His cross. Also, only a few survived, implying the Bible's prediction that in the end, only a few will make it into heaven. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but I couldn't help but see that kind of symbolism in the story.Still, a great movie. My only gripe, and I am by no means a prude, as you will see by reading some of my other reviews, but they overdid it a bit with the use of profanity. After a while, hearing people scream things like, ""This is no g--d--engine room!"" and ""Where the hell are we?"" every fourth word got a bit tiresome. As I said, I'm no prude, but some of it seemed unnecessary. After all, General Patton wasn't on that ship. But it told the story very well and, just as you thought you could relax a bit and catch your breath from all the excitement because you didn't think anything else would happen, the ship would explode or spring another leak and then all unreconstructed upside down hell would break loose again. It never completely let you relax. You were always vigilant for the next thing to happen, and that is good story telling.Another gripe of mine is I have not been able to find the soundtrack to this movie. It's an early one by the great John Williams, and I can't believe you can't buy this on CD. The main title theme brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it, and then there's the MORNING AFTER song that Marueen McGovern made a monster hit back in 1972. If someone knows where I can find this soundtrack, please post a note on this site and let me know. Otherwise, great movie! Ignore the bad rap. 9 out of 10.",The Poseidon Adventure
109,blazesnakes9,"It's Hell, Upside Down.",7,11 February 2015,"In the 1970's, disaster movies took a toll on American cinema. New Hollywood directors were already starting to make movies that they wanted to see. Directors such as Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Bob Rafelson and others were making movies that would launch them into stardom. Disaster movies also launch people into stardom. But, one particular director did get recognition for his body of work in the 1970's by creating some of the best disaster movies of all time. His name? Irwin Allen.Allen was a producer who's nickname was the ""Master of Disaster"". One of his earliest motion pictures was Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea in 1961. Because ""Voyage"" was a big hit in 1961, Allen decides to make movies and by the early 70's, he hit the jackpot. By 1972, The Poseidon Adventure was one of the high-grossing movies at that time. It took a while to get the movie off the ground. And doing so wasn't a easy task.The movie tells the story of a luxury ocean liner called the S.S Poseidon, en route from New York to Athens. Among the many passengers on the S.S Poseidon are: Reverand Scott (Gene Hackman), policeman Mike Rogo, (Ernest Borgnine), an shy and meek bachelor, (Red Buttons), an elderly Jewish couple, (Jack Alberton and Shelly Winters), and a brother and sister, (Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). All of these characters aboard the S.S Poseidon are celebrating New Year's Eve that night.Just after midnight, the ship's crew and passengers's celebration soon came to a stop when a 90 foot tidal wave, capsizing the ship, sending the passengers, crashing down on what used to be the ship's ceiling. Once the ship capsizes, the remaining survivors must race against time as the liner starts to fill with water. Along the way, the few remaining passengers must work their way toward the engine room in order to escape. The obstacles that they have to cross are the hot and steamy kitchen, the flooded smokestack, claustrophobic vents and pipes and underwater passageways.The Poseidon Adventure is based on a best-selling novel by Paul Gallico. Gallico based his novel on a incident he had on the RMS Queen Mary. The movie though is not excellent nor four-star material. But, it does work for a few reasons. One of them is the visual effects. The F/X are very convincing and very exciting as the ship capsizes although in some exterior shots of the ship, it looks at as if the makers of the movie used a miniature ship instead of a real ship. What I like about The Poseidon Adventure is the sheer camp style of the movie itself. Disaster movies are not really movies that you would overpraise because of the number of stars that they used, but what does makes sense is that they are equivalently exciting as a popcorn movie. This is one of those films where even though today, it looks dated, it can still be enjoyed and still be loved for a very long time.The performances though, aren't really Oscar caliber. Hackman at that time in 1972, had already won the Oscar for The French Connection. I wonder why he would signed on to a picture like this. Ernest Borgnine holds the second best-remembered performance in the movie as the grumpy and profane policeman, who's wife is a prostitute. Even some of the supporting cast like Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Pamela Sue Martin and even Lesile Neilson as the captain does their best to back up the two leading stars.The art direction and set design of the ship is very convincing and very well-done. Even when the ship capsizes, I could tell that the set design was sort of bearing down on some of the actors because of the damages on the costumes.The Poseidon Adventure was the earliest template of what a disaster movie should have. In order to make one successful, you would to round up the best actors that we have in the industry and have them play interesting or no interesting characters and have them either escape though a sinking ship or escape from a burning building. Now, of course, you might say to yourselves, ""Isn't that a bad idea?"" ""Is it a bad idea to have actors do as much physical work instead of acting?"" Sometimes yes and sometimes no. But what does come out of it is that disaster movies are basically plugged in plots and characters. The Poseidon Adventure is the perfect example. On a level of camp, it works. But as a spectacular motion picture, it doesn't work. The reason why is that because disaster movies, in my opinion, don't need to exceed excellence. A few examples of bad disaster movies that I think failed to excite me or intrigue me are The Hindenburg, When Time Ran Out, Earthquake, Aiport 1975, Airport '77 and The Concorde: Aiport '79.After the success of The Poseidon Adventure, Allen continue to work throughout the 1970's. His next big-budget disaster movie was The Towering Inferno, released in 1974. In my opinion, both The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno are probably the two best disaster movies of this particular era. After those two, I don't think Irwin Allen would repeat the same for his other pictures that he produced. His last two pictures were When Time Ran Out in 1980 and The Swarm in 1978. Both films were disaster movies that failed. By that time, disaster movies had ran out of ideas by the early 1980's. But The Poseidon Adventure didn't ran out of ideas for Allen. ★★★ 3 stars.",The Poseidon Adventure

This film builds suspense rather nicely and somehow manages to pull you into the story.  Gene Hackman is a bit annoying as a bizarre preacher.  Some of the things his character says don't seem like anything a real person would say.  There is a bit of this problem with some of the other main characters also who on occasion have some inane dialogue, not to mention some of the passengers who  seem like your typical stupid herd of victims type caricatures.

This is a fun popcorn movie, but that's about it.  The concept of the movie is great. The idea of people being trapped in a boat which is upside down is interesting and fun to watch.  I like the beginning of the movie with Leslie Nielsen.    However, the characters in the movie and some of their dialogue is inane. The characters played by Gene Hackman and Stella Stevens are the two which are most over the top.  It is so campy in places, it is unintentionally funny.  Actually, Gene Hackman's character being a minister made no sense and the scene where he preaches at a church service on the deck of the Poseidon is absurd and insulting.  And Stella Stevens was schizoid and grating in her role.  Nobody could be as dumb and one dimensional as her character.  At times, it feels like the movie is trying to convey some profound message about humanity, which spoils the movie because it's much too pretentious for this movie.The Poseidon works best when it is a straight forward disaster flick.

Watching it on video in 2002 all I could do was laugh. The only two believable performances in the whole mess were Carol Lynley and Red Buttons.Everyone else is just plain awful. Leslie Nielson obviously got his job on ""Airplane"" because of his thankfully brief performance here. I can't decide who gave the most awful performance here- the little kid who played Robin (Eric Shea), his sister (Pamela Sue Martin)or Stella Stevens. I think I have to declare them all the winners. The little kid was an unexperienced actor who was directed badly, Pamela Sue Martin had nothing to work with except the strident line readings of her little brother and Stella Stevens was just given plain awful dialogue to speak and didn't have the talent to rise above the material. But don't let this review scare you off from seeing this movie. This is the granddaddy of modern disaster films. It spawned a whole bunch more disaster films even worse than this and paved the way for the blockbuster era which has been the death knell of serious movie making in Hollywood.

115,hcalderon1,It was exciting as Titanic,6,6 February 2005,One day out to sea it starts a beautiful day on a big cruise. But what happens when a dangerous tidal wave suddenly turns the ship upside down. How would you get out and survive. This movie tries to answer that question. With great suspense and excitement you wonder how a band of survivors led by Gene Hackman will make it out alive. This movie was good but Titanic was better. Although it had great actings by Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. It failed at with less excitement. But I still liked it. Still it could have been better in some parts of the movie. As you watch as read about this you wonder what they could've done to avoid this situation from being so bad.,The Poseidon Adventure
116,Mickey-2,"A perilous escape from an overturned ocean liner, but who dares to try?",9,11 November 1998,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" starts out as a rather routine ocean voyage but turns into a very risky escape from disaster, thanks to a massive tidal wave striking the ship on New Year's Eve.The Poseidon is an old vessel on its way to the scrap yard, but its last voyage is never completed.  Instead, only a few of the passengers survive the overturning of the ship, and manage to climb to the hull, which is now afloat.  Gene Hackman plays the leader of the small group, with excellent back-up from Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, and Red Buttons.  Female leads are handled with skill by Stella Stevens and Shelly Winters.  Each deck the small group climbs brings them closer to the engine room, and safety in the hull, but the water keeps edging ever closer.  Who finally survives?Rent this one to find out, or better still, buy it.  A must-see.",The Poseidon Adventure
117,Putzberger,A World Turned Upside Down,10,17 February 2006,"""Poseidon Adventure,"" like all great disaster movies, creates dramatic tension by exploiting basic fears, in this case falling, drowning and burning. That might be why the movie is so vivid despite rather pedestrian special effects. You don't need an MFA in film to figure out how they did most of it -- if you can tilt a camera, turn on a fire hose and nail a toilet to the ceiling, you can pretty much remake ""The Poseidon Adventure."" And the acting is so cartoonish and histrionic you have trouble believing that this cast has, all told, piled up 7 Oscars (2 each for Gene and Shelley). But in fairness, the script is overstuffed with mawkish, corny, tin-eared dialogue (""come here, you lousy cop!"") that can't be delivered without sounding hammy.I love this movie. I think it's brilliant.No, I don't just love it in an ironic way, it's actually a masterpiece, an allegory so blatant it needs all its overblown camp elements to keep it from ascending to the level of fable or parable. More Biblical than ""The Ten Commandments"" or any of those other annoyingly literal epics, ""Poseidon Adventure"" is about man's search for God. A holy man, of uncertain ordination, is experiencing a crisis of faith that leads him to preach self-help theology. (Potential spoiler: he's saved by the death of a Jew.) A cop discovers his humanity through his redemptive love of a prostitute. A sad old bachelor rediscovers his will to live by helping an abandoned, frightened young woman. The central question of this film is how do we find salvation, and it offers this answer: within ourselves. Notice the contrasting fates of those who actively seek salvation and those who await it passively -- Gene Hackman, who has led his small flock upward/downward in the hope of survival, watches with mingled pity and horror as a deluge sweeps away those who have obeyed the ship steward's counsel to sit and wait. (A rather Protestant message, it must be said.) To underscore the metaphysical theme, there's plenty of shouting up into an echoing void, plus scores of characters falling into infernos. There's even the possibility that ""Poseidon Adventure"" is a Gnostic narrative -- via a schism, the characters are cast into an imperfect, upside-down world and seek through faith and effort to escape into the perfect (well, at least right-side-up) realm. No wonder this movie has inspired such a cult.And if you choose to ignore the subtext, you can have a pretty good time anyway. Please don't bother to suspend your disbelief. There's no way you can convince yourself that Carol Lynley can sing or that Red Buttons is heterosexual or that Shelley Winters is a very skinny lady, in the water or anywhere else. Enjoy ""The Poseidon Adventure"" for its many absurdities -- Stella's panties, Shelley's panties, Pamela Sue's hotpants and Lolita-like lust for a much older man, and the hysterically untalented Eric Shea as the requisite annoying kid. There are even some genuinely good things in it, namely Jack Albertson, who manages to create a rather moving and believable character, even if he's overshadowed by his louder, more melodramatic castmates. Go rent this right now.",The Poseidon Adventure
118,Dandy_Desmond,Hell upside down!,10,8 May 2010,"For a disaster film this ticks all the right boxes. Although for its time The Poseidon Adventure was seen as a special effects spectacular what is more apparent years later is how well crafted the characters are. For example Gene Hackman plays Reverend Scott who preaches that god only helps those who help themselves, and has a discussion about if that is true with another priest before the wave hits. This is a theme that runs throughout the film as he is the one who persuades a small group to try and climb to the engine room to save themselves leaving lots behind who stay and wait for help. **spoiler!***After several exiting set pieces and a couple of deaths Reverend Scott finally loses it and has it out with god at the end doubting his own theory, and sacrifices himself to save the remaining few. Mr and Mrs Rosen, a happy old couple who you genuinely want to make it through, and the continuing friction between Reverend Scott and Mike Rogo. The quiet man who finds an inner strength to help a petrified and grieving young singer - good characters who are well drawn before the disaster happens. I really think even after all these years The Poseidon Adventure remains the greatest disaster movie of them all. Effects can get better - the remake had great effects but still overall did not come close to this. The sets still look excellent, the effects are still decent and its a thrilling couple of hours of anyones time.",The Poseidon Adventure
119,fleagles,Sinking and stinking,6,12 September 2000,"This was among the first of the `All-Star' disaster movies of the 70's, and which were so well-spoofed in `Airplane!'.  The plot involves a tidal wave that manages to flip over a large cruise ship, and the all-star cast (at least in 1972), which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Red Buttons. With the exception of Hackman (is this how you follow The French Connection ?), the rest of the cast was better suited to the Love Boat, and not this boat.  The dialogue is inanely silly, and Hackman, playing a cussing, derriere-grabbing reverend, just screams through most of this.  It may have some larger cultural significance, but The Poseidon Adventure simply sinks.",The Poseidon Adventure
120,dwr246,"""There's got to be a morning after...""",7,4 May 2006,"I read the book first, and since I liked it, I was eager to see the movie. This was my first experience with watching something that had been adapted from a book, and I found the differences fascinating. In the end, I'd have to say the book was better, but this film, while a bit campy at times, is still pretty good.The plot is quite simple. The S.S. Poseidon, on its way across the Atlantic, encounters a huge wave which capsizes it. This happens pretty early in the movie, and the bulk of the action is about a group of survivors who were in the dining room at the time the ship capsized. While the officers among them tell them to stay put until help comes, the Rev. Frank Scott (Gene Hackman), a man of action rather than contemplation, figures their best hope of escape is to head for the hull of the ship - specifically ""shaft alley"" where the hull is thinnest. Joining him are Det. Mike Rogo (Ernest Borgnine) and his abrasive wife, Linda (Stella Stevens), a former prostitute; Manny (Jack Albertson) and Belle (Shelley Winters) Rosen, on their way to Israel to see their grandson; Robin (Eric Shea) and Susan (Pamela Sue Martin) Shelby, on their way to join their parents in Greece; James Martin (Red Buttons), a haberdasher from Chicago; Nonnie Parry (Carol Lynley), the singer with the band; and Acres (Roddie McDowell), a steward. After they climb up the Christmas tree to the steward's passage to the kitchen, Rev. Scott's point is proved when the skylight in the dining room bursts, flooding the room. From then on, it's a race against fire, steam, and rising water to get to the hull so they can be rescued. It's also a guessing game as to who will survive, and who won't.Paul Gallico's novel was a very cerebral book, and that aspect of it wouldn't have translated well to the screen. In order to keep the pacing up, the writers left a lot of those elements out of the book. The movie suffers a little for this, and at times becomes a little campy. On the whole, though, the choices were fairly solid, and the pacing is good, and the obstacles faced exciting.The acting is good, but then the movie boasts a competent cast. Hackman isn't really believable as a priest, but he plays a man of action to perfection. Borgnine's tough exterior works well for Rogo, and his hurt at losing his wife is beautifully handled. Stevens' manages to make Linda a likable character - no small feat if you've ever read the book. Winters does a great job in playing a Jewish grandmother. Albertson, however, seems to phoning his part in. Lynley's shell shocked performance of Nonnie works, for the most part. Red Buttons enthusiasm works quite well. Martin's love struck teenager is a bit over the top. And Shea's precocious kid is a nice mix of both adorable, and annoying traits.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't raise the same kinds of questions that the book does about how ordinary people fare in an extraordinary situation. What is does do is entertain, and that it does well.",The Poseidon Adventure
121,shhimundercoverdamnit,The Poseidon Adventure (1972),8,1 November 2006,"At midnight on New Years Eve the S.S. Poseidon is struck by a 90' tidal wave and is capsized. In a last gasp, a priest ( Gene Hackman) takes a mixed band of survivors on a journey through the bowels of the ship in an attempt to survive.Paving the way for a series of spectacular action-adventure epics throughout the 70's and even spanning a recent remake, The Poseidon Adventure still remains a favorite among audiences everywhere. Gene Hackman leads the all-star cast that includes Jack Albertson, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, Stella Stevens, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin and Shelly Winters.One of the main themes of this film is faith and trust. For example, the very first example of this is really Susan's ( Pamela Sue Martin) ' leap of faith.' "" Don't be afraid, trust us."" Secondly, Gene Hackman's character is a priest and he is not only a natural leader, but he is also a questioning hero! The best example of this, I can give is the scene where Hackman's character Rev. Scott has a complete look of anguish and grief over his face when the people on the main floor choose to stay.Ernest Borgnine's cop character Rogo, is almost like a parallel to Rev. Scott, almost as if they are the same person, but they simply chose different paths in life and faith. For example, Rogo wants proof. He won't stick his neck out simply on ' blind faith.' Red Buttons, Mr. Martin is pretty much simply a mediator between Rev. Scott and Rogo. In a sense, he is just quite simply a reluctant hero who rises to the occasion. All of us would like to think we would be able to rise to the occasion as well, in the same situation. His relationship with Nonnie (Carol Lynley) is quite interesting. Ironically, they actually disliked each other intensely and refused to have anything to do with each other except when the cameras were rolling.The best scene from the entire film comes after a certain death, and Susan completely losses it.",The Poseidon Adventure
122,KIDOLOHKEN,Gene Hackman's best work.,9,8 August 2020,"Gene Hackman is a very interesting actor and you can't really tell his personality from his face and expression. He seems to be a good guy and a bad guy. and I think he's a bad guy more than a good guy. I didn't know what his role is in this movie
Which one is this time?
... I was already swallowed up by the suspense. I think that's the power of Gene Hackman as an actor. And from my point of view, Gene Hackman played an unexpected character in this movie and established the movie quickly.
There are a lot of movies about the Titanic, but I'd take this Poseidon adventure is the best. The story structure is brilliant, the characters are characteristic and vivid, and each episode is interesting...
DiCaprio fans will disagree, though.",The Poseidon Adventure
123,pninson,One of the worst turkeys I've ever seen,4,4 January 2007,"From the opening minutes, there's something listless, flat, and tone-deaf about this picture. And it only gets worse from there. Cardboard characters, ridiculous dialogue, and tepid direction distance the viewer from the action so that it all seems faintly absurd.It's fun to see Gene Hackman with long hair, but his part is completely unbelievable and his performance is hardly worth mentioning. Hackman is a terrific actor but no one could rescue this miserable script.When disaster finally strikes, it's hard to believe in what's going on. The setup is ineptly done, the tension doesn't build, and everyone is overacting so hysterically all you can do is laugh.I was so bored that halfway through the picture I switched to the Spanish soundtrack. This made things more interesting because the dialogue doesn't sound so idiotic in a foreign language, and as a student of Spanish, trying to follow the story gave me something to do while waiting for the movie to be over.I'll admit the picture does improve somewhat around the halfway point (or maybe it was just the Spanish lesson kicking in). Shelley Winters does emerge with a shred of dignity, but it's a tragedy that when she died, the newspaper stories all said she was best remembered for the Poseidon Adventure. Now we know how Judi Dench feels about being known for playing ""M"" in recent Bond flicks. Winters was a brilliant actress and this is hardly the best way to remember her. Still, she winds up being the closest thing to an actual person in this parade of cookie cutter characters.This isn't quite as bad as the abominable ""Earthquake"" but only just. Give me ""The Towering Inferno"" anytime.",The Poseidon Adventure

""The Poseidon Adventure"" holds up well, I think, considering it's 27 years old!  The disaster formula used in this film wasn't new in 1972, but it was handled well, and it has been done to death ever since.  What works in ""Poseidon"" that often doesn't work in modern variations is the work of all those ""old pros"" (i.e, the cast).  They make the most of under-written characters, and even when they're bitching (as Stella Stevens does so well in this film), they're likeable.  I remember being very upset when a certain character actress ""bought the farm"" (so to speak)--her character was one of my favorites.  The effects don't show their age at all, and it's nice to see a film with CGI!

This one, as others have said IS better and I'll tell you why. In Titanic we have just one story going, where as in this one we have several. The subtle budding romance between Nonnie and Mr. Martin was very interesting to watch. I thought they were a rather odd pairing at first, but it worked seeing how they both needed each other. Linda Rogo was my favorite character. She knew what to say and how to say it. She even told her pompus husband off a few times. The fact that she's an ex-prostitute and her husband being the cop that arrested her made their story rather interesting. Mr. Rogo and the Preacher's quarrels were amusing and heated. I liked the Rosens, they were the strong ones and you could truly see the love they had for one another. The kid was annoying, but useful and I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Susan and the Preacher. Their scenes were my favorite. This movie has a cast of truly rich characters that were more entertaining to watch than the actual effects. Ah!

I saw this as a 6yr old and still remember it today on New Years Eve as I just watched it this morning bringing back so many memories that made me the movie buff I am. I never forgot it from the wonderful soundtrack (Oscar winning ) and the cinematography (Oscar winning) which was earned the old fashioned way imagination, not by some computer generated initiative. I love movies today but I still remember good movies and how they were made in yesteryear also. It's kinda like comparing atheletes when people(younger people especially) when they say Lebron is better than Oscar R or Michael J, the players are all great in their time, if either Michael or Oscar were here today they would still be GREAT, as Lebron is today, but to say he is better is foolish, This a Great Movie today as it was in 1973.

Screaming, crying, telling the world they can't stand it. For some reason, none of the men were like this, even that annoying little brat.The main character, Gene Hackman is supposed to just be a preacher, but he also seems to be a ship engineer, knows which parts of the ship to go to over the other 100's of people.

The kids really liked the film. They laughed at Stella Stevens outrageous lines, thought Shelley Winters was annoying until she died saving the whole group and then they got very quiet, and thought that the characters in general were memorable. My lone freshman in the class said it was better than the remake because he felt he got to know the the people more. One thing was mentioned--why were there no fish swimming around in all that ocean water? I guess this comes from showing older films to kids today who look for extreme realism!

130,ghettodogaudio06,Cool Natural Disaster Flick Kids!,8,4 February 2008,The Poseidon Adventure is a 1972 Gene Hackman flick I recall seeing in the early eighties. When re-watching I remembered the scene where the fat lady dies after saving the preacher. This movie is so realistic and striking for it's time. This would have been a very high budget film to make. It was so funny how there was so many shots of the blond hooker in her panties or an ass shot. Like when she's climbing up that one ladder and you can several times easily see her ass cheeks. The kids were cute and I love the ex police officer. Gene Hackman rocks and is awesome as the preacher man. I love the Jewish guy and the foreign girl and redheaded guy. Very well written script. Awesome camera shots and set design. Very realistic and disturbing for a film this old school. But the old movies are always the classics. This film is totally shot on 35mm motion picture film and is edited pretty slickly. I can imagine this film would have grossed very wealthy profits at the box office in 72' when this film was originally released.,The Poseidon Adventure

132,flackjacket,There's got to be a moaning aftahhhhh...,1,1 August 2013,"Somewhere in a Hollywood boardroom back in the early 70's somebody must have said, ""Hey, let's assemble a large group of semi-known supporting actors, put them in a cruise ship, have it flip upside-down then watch them try to escape.""Apparently someone replied, ""Great idea, but I think we should add a ton of profanity to make it ""70's"" trendy... Hell, let's even throw a preacher character and failed kid actor from Disney with permanent botox lips and have them use profanity as well."" The reply, ""I love it! But what it really needs is an obnoxious theme song played several times throughout the movie... would be groovy to have a band on board that only plays that one song... over and over, ad nauseam.""Unfortunately nobody ever stopped to think, ""How would a capsized, disabled ship have light?"" Or, ""Who's gonna believe Ernest Borgnine landed Stella Stevens?"" So they ended up making one of the most poorly acted, over acted, poorly directed films in the history of Hollywood. The only believable character is played by Leslie Nielsen, the Captain who dies when the ship flips over.As the film goes on and on for what seems like an eternity, it's almost as if you're hoping these pathetic characters die rather than reach safety due to the fact they are all so annoying, especially the botox lipped kid (Eric Shea) and the fat whiner (Shelly Winters).",The Poseidon Adventure

Just to make sure you know thattsunamis don't happen in open seas, it's only when the water gets soshallow that the water volume doesn't fit between surface and bottomthat the waves rise.

But there are NO big waves in openseas, only on beaches, every surfer knows that. Well, maybe if areally big meteor hits the Earth, but then the wave will move insupersonic speeds. That wave would be essentially solid, it wouldinstantly turn the ship into a two-dimensional structure and each ofthe passengers into a pizza-shaped pink pancake.Well, let's give those guys a break, they tried to make a movie, not aphysics class.

134,MatBrewster,Not Bad For What It Is,7,3 May 2005,"There are a few movies I remember being surprised at as a child. These were movies that I saw on television or Beta/VHS that were made before my time and not meant as children's stories. Some of them were genuine classics like To Kill a Mockingbird that instilled in me a sense that beauty and art can be found in a film. Others were like the Poseidon Adventure that while not particularly masterful films still showed me that there were many other films out there besides the ""family"" films being churned out at the local cineplex. These films eventually opened up to me the world of cinema.I first saw the Poseidon Adventure at Grandma and Papa's house. I had been dropped off by my mother for an afternoon while she went shopping or some other mundane task. After flipping channels awhile I came across this great sinking ship and fell mystified into a grand epic adventure. To this day I recall my mother coming home during the final 20 minutes or so and me making her stay because I just had to see the ending. She had seen the film, but praised it as a classic adventure and allowed me to see the end. Periodically I have caught bits and pieces of the movie again on cable and always pause to watch a scene or two. I bought it in a bargain bin a few months back and joyfully added it to my collection. Last night Amy and I decided to watch it.Watching it on DVD I realize this was the first time I have ever actually seen the very beginning of the movie. As a child I caught the picture 10-20 minutes into and all subsequent viewings have all been by catching it part way through on television. I am afraid the movie as a whole doesn't hold up all that well to my childhood memory. Oh, it's a big, grand adventure, but like the ship of the movie, it starts to sink under its own enormousness.It has a basic 70's disaster movie plot. Big ocean cruise liner is hit by enormous wave and is turned upside down, killing nearly everyone. A few survivors are followed as they make their way up (down?) the ship and try to escape. It is way over the top and it almost seems as if the director Ronald Neame told his actors to ham it up in every scene. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine do their best howling at each other in every other scene.The script follows very basic rules. It rolls like something you would see in a basic screenwriter's class. You start with an establishing shot, follow it with a basic introduction of your main characters while making sure their essential character motivation is directly handed to the audience in their first few minutes of screen time. Then you set your plot into action. It's disaster is even set into action by an evil corporate leader. Leslie Nielson plays the good captain who is hounded by a goon sent from the ships corporate owner to ensure it ports for its final time on the right date. The corporate goon orders Nielson's captain to increase speed though Nielson argues this will surely cause the old ship to sink. The corporate goon, of course, wins and sets up the disaster. On a side note it is unintentionally funny to watch Nielson in a serious role when everyone knows his slew of later, goofier roles in movies such as the Naked Gun and Airplane.This film acts like it invented implausibly. Gene Hackman reverend moves, acts, and orders others around like he's the ship's captain though he has no previous knowledge of how the ship's design, or conceivably the physics of a cruise liner. Yet his motivation for acting like this was set up earlier. Before the ship sinks we get a sermon from this unorthodox preacher who believes in helping onesfelf instead of relying on Divine intervention. Likewise all the other characters follow along in their previously established types, never budging from this set character mold and certainly not evolving in any meaningful way.All of this is not to say the film isn't enjoyable. It is not high art after all. It knows full well it's purpose is to entertain the audience and nothing more. It does this quite well. Though its plot is strained it moves along with a quick pace and maintains a claustrophobic tension throughout. I have not seen many of the other disaster movies of the era so I cannot place the Poseidon Adventure accordingly amongst their ranks. But as an action/adventure flick you could do worse.",The Poseidon Adventure
135,rorymacveigh-66661,Peril under the sea!,7,31 March 2015,"From that time in movie history where our desire to build bigger and better things led us to make films that devoted their entire time do destroying those big and better things, and the Poseidon Adventure has gone down in history as one of the greatest disaster movies of all time. For me personally, it's a very good film, but there are some things that drag it down (pun possibly intended).What's the cauliflower? The film follows the passengers and crew of the SS Poseidon, sailing through the Mediterranean on its final voyage before decommissioning. On New Year's Eve the ship is at full sail, but in order to meet schedule the representative of the Shipping Line insists that the ship continues on course without taking on ballast, to the unsuccessful protest of the Captain. As night falls the passengers gather in the ballroom for their New Year's Party, but reports come in of an undersea earthquake that has triggered a massive Tsunami, which strikes the ship causing it to capsize because it's too top-heavy, leaving the entire vessel floating but upside down. The film follows a handful of survivors as they attempt to make their way to the thinnest part of the ship's hull in the hope that they can be rescued, dodging death on their slowly sinking vessel every step of the way!To me, the film is very very good at building the tension, the fact that these people are trapped inside a giant metal coffin with no way out. They have no idea whether going to their destination will result in the rescue, but that thin slither of hope keeps them going through all odds, and that's what keeps you gripped. You want to see these people escape, and you find it genuinely tragic when many of them die, some more suddenly than others.I do however have some peeves. One is the whole idea of the ship being stuck upside down like that. I somehow get the feeling that the vessel would still sink, with what air is trapped in the hull just finding a weakness and bursting through to let more water in. But that's technical shipbuilding babble that nags me.The other problem is that some of the acting does get a little corny at times, with some of the performances going a little over-the-top. Indeed a romantic relationship between two of the characters is a bit hard to comprehend as well, and ultimately leads to nothing.But other than that, the rest of the film is a very intense, very gripping thriller about escaping what can be some people's interpretation of hell. The sets and locations built to replicate the inner workings of the vessel are done perfectly, making you truly believe that you're actually in the bowels of an upturned ship. The action scenes are also quite poignant, keeping you on the edge of your seat as they dodge death at every turn, from boiling vats of water, to bursting bulkheads and collapsing pieces of the ship's interior.On the whole, as a survival thriller movie I'd say definitely give it a watch!",The Poseidon Adventure
136,Johnny B,"Great adventure, but poor script",8,23 September 1998,"As I have already stated, this movie deals with an incredibly great adventure (anyone heard of a cruise liner going upside down with survivors?), but as far as the script is concerned it wastes the talents of its good stars.  When I watched it for the first time, at the beginning it gave me the impression that it just a low-budget sleazy 70s film.  However after the tidal wave finally hits the ship, things start getting more interesting.  Obviously it contains many loose ends (example: how did the second group of survivors leave the sunken hall? and how did they end up?). Anyway, this movie proved to be quite entertaining in its genre and it was quite a good start for the string of disaster movies of the 70s.",The Poseidon Adventure
137,djfoster,A little waterlogged,7,7 January 1999,"At one time this all-star ""adventure"" film seemed a trail-blazer.  After all, it started the Irwin Allen-powered disaster film phenomenon of the seventies.  Today, the acting seems melodramatic and characters cardboard. However, that it has characaters we grow to care about is a major improvement over the cartoon figures who walk through modern disaster movies like ""Armageddon.""",The Poseidon Adventure
138,lurch-17,"Disaster Movie - Technical, that is",2,21 July 2000,"2001 - One of the most trite, overacted, poorly directed things I've seen. Shelley is such a ham (theatrically and physiologically). Anyone with half a brain would close each and every watertight door they passed through on the way to the top (bottom). If indeed somehow the ship stayed afloat, it would have sunk in a couple of minutes after all the entrapped air, which provided the only buoyancy, escaped through the giant hole they cut in the hull - but we saw not a whisper come out!Revised 5/06 - Just saw snippets of this on TV. It is worse than I remembered. It is such a technical disaster. Possibly OK for anyone who has never been to sea. It was amazing how they could walk around on the ceilings. In fact, they would have to crawl almost everywhere - as the ceilings are covered with lights, pipes, wires, ceiling tiles, sprinkler pipes, etc, etc, etc.And where did all that light come from? Was the ships generator still running, or were there giant batteries (upside down) powering everything?",The Poseidon Adventure

The first half an hour may seem soporific, but this just lulls us into a false sense of security, then the action hits us with MegaVolt intensity. This film could only have been made in the seventies. It has that genuinely dirty seventies look to it, as opposed to the pristine polish of such nonsense as Titanic or Dante's Peak or any of the disaster pics they make today. And it has a top score by Williams, which I believe is buyable on Cd. Buy this one now on widescreen.",The Poseidon Adventure

141,fineanimal,A Real Disaster,2,26 November 2004,"This film trudges forward solely on the power of a truly annoying set of characters, most of whom are filled with self-pity from start to finish, and none of whom seem particularly worthy of surviving the disaster. Everyone screams, everyone whines, everyone complains, and everyone moves slower than molasses to escape drowning at the top (bottom) of a capsized cruise ship. One main character (Nonnie) remains almost catatonic throughout the entire film, much like the plot. Heavily dated in the early 1970's. Only worth watching Leslie Nielsen as the caption until the boat capsizes. From then on this film is a disaster. Rating: 2/10 for Nielsen and sets/special effects that are impressive for the period.",The Poseidon Adventure
142,rexmagicman,Still the granddaddy of disaster/survival films,10,5 August 2021,"I watch this movie several times a year, and never grow tired of it (saw it in the theatres when it first premiered, too). Just watched it again the other night, and wondered why it has such staying power, for people to remember it and love it after almost 50 years?? Where did this succeed, and the remake fail?Well, for one thing, you have characters that are memorable, relatable, and believable (and mostly faithful to the novel it was based on). Many of us know couples like the Rogos, who love each other but relate to each other by bickering non-stop. And the Rosens, older and deeply in love, so much so they haven't even said ""I love you"" to each other since they don't know when. The concerned and modern Reverend Scott, Nonnie, James Martin, Acres, brother and sister Susan and Robin......all memorable, even after all these years. And the entire all-star ensemble cast is just that....they worked together as an ""ensemble"", and all of their interactions play true and real. The fact that the actors did most of their own stunts is just icing on the cake.Then the 2006 remake -- the remake kept the story somewhat intact, but strayed from the novel's characters and created new characters, so many it was easy to lose track and interest. And, like many remakes they thought ""bigger and better special effects will make this a winner"" --- when in actuality you need a good story and overall foundation to make it a classic like this version that will always stand the test of time.For this 1972 version, in addition to the incredible cast you have the fantastic cinematography, amazing sets, special effects that still hold up and don't look dated at all, an incredible score by John Williams.....it just all works so well and delivers the best in blockbuster entertainment. Irwin Allen was the king of his craft, and he hit a home run with this one.",The Poseidon Adventure

149,aj-to,As cheesy as it can get,3,14 September 2007,"I honestly don't understand what people see in this horrible movie. It's such a feast of bad taste, plain awful! It has whole the lack of taste that characterizes the seventies, and is so unbelievable cheesy that words cannot say. The acting is really miserable, the characters are empty, the effects totally unconvincing, in one word: it makes you puke. Stay away from this monstrosity and, for all that, from the people that apparently appreciate it. They are to be pitied. It sticks out that almost never ever a seventies movie can captivate or even amuse me. In my opinion the seventies demonstrate a total decline of taste whatsoever. Maybe there are exceptions for the music (though the introduction of commercial motives has severely damaged it), but in most other parts of the creative process (art, fashion, movies, opinion) the seventies are a disaster. It's typical for the nihilistic mood nowadays that a revival of that decade is seen; people evidently lack depth of feeling. Anyway, this film is a disgrace for the movie business. I don't value it higher than a 3, and it should kiss my feet for that.",The Poseidon Adventure

As i am to young to recognize most faces in this film, I cannot say much for them as I could for the remake. Writing: 8/10 A very good script for a very good disaster movie.

All is well placed and made, with fine direction. Special Effects: 10/10 Being an older film I expected the effects to be horrible to the point that I might see a stray rubber ducky float by the ship.

152,Tremor,There's got to be a morning after...,10,17 May 2000,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" stands out as the best of the disaster film genre,which was spawned by 1970's ""Airport"" and recently revived with both worthy successors (""Titanic"") and some not-so-worthy (""Volcano"",""Daylight"" and ""Dante's Peak"".) The film's plot goes something like this...on New Year's Eve,a tidal wave capsizes the S.S.Poseidon during its journey from the States to Greece,and a small band of survivors (ten to be exact),led by a fiery preacher (the superb Gene Hackman),struggles to escape from the rising waters by climbing to the engine room,which is now located at the top of the ship. Shelley Winters is a standout among the top-notch all-star supporting cast (which includes Ernest Borgnine,Red Buttons,Carol Lynley,Roddy McDowall,Stella Stevens,Jack Albertson,Pamela Sue Martin and Eric Shea). The Oscar-winning special effects and set design will knock your socks off, and the film's theme song ""The Morning After"",sung by Maureen McGovern is also excellent (it won a Best Original Song Oscar). What separates ""Poseidon"" from the other films in the disaster genre is that you will find yourselves really caring about the characters,and the film's writers and producers were not afraid to kill off its lead characters. My score: 10 out of 10! Simply the best!",The Poseidon Adventure

154,waynewass427,Irwin Allen's Best Disaster Adventure,9,28 February 2016,"It has been argued which of the 1970's ""disaster genre"" movies is the absolute best...Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno. As some IMDb members have pointed out, ""Airport"" started the genre, and films like Earthquake and Airport 75 were highly entertaining additions. But when it all boils down to it, PA and TI were the two most popular at the box office, each easily topping $100 million in domestic ticket sales.I saw Towering Inferno upon its theatrical release in December 1974, at the age of 9, and was crazy about it, because a) I wanted to be a fireman, and b) loved all the great action (especially watching the fire trucks racing through the rolling hills of San Francisco, and the Navy rescue helicopters, as well as the amazing John Williams soundtrack).However, as the years have passed by, and having watched the theatrical version of Poseidon Adventure on cable several times, I now feel that it is the better of the two movies.First of all, it is one hour shorter, which means we get more action per minute, and less ""fluff"".Perhaps most important of all, we get to see and know the main characters in much greater depth than we ever do in Towering Inferno. That alone makes for much greater drama, because we get to care for them more deeply.Also the underlying themes in PA, such as faith, new-found courage, self-sacrifice, overcoming self-doubt and arrogance, and learning to trust a child to help lead us to safety are so well written and acted out, it just adds all the more to the viewing experience.Above all else, what makes for a truly great disaster epic is having people we truly care about / root for.Poseidon Adventure does this in a way that Towering Inferno never accomplishes. In TI, Irwin Allen was going for true thrills, with less emphasis on the individuals. And with the drama / suspense of the blowing up of the water tanks, plus John Williams masterful score, it is a truly great ""thrill ride"", albeit with at least 30 minutes of excess running time.And, even though I love Steve McQueen's ""Chief Michael O'Hallorhan"" in TI, I dare say that Gene Hackman's ""Reverend Scott"" is just as good, if not more powerful and charismatic. If you want a truly epic ""1970s disaster film"", Poseidon Adventure delivers at every level.",The Poseidon Adventure
155,kevcom,Still Seaworthy,9,6 June 2001,"Anyone who has seen as many disaster movies as I have knows that this is absolutely the best one ever made. For a film nearly thirty years old, Poseidon Adventure is still so effective that it would cause anyone planning to take a cruise to think twice. You probably know the plot--luxury liner capsized by a tidal wave. This synopsis is brought to life with suspense, drama, and sometimes, terrifying reality. One of the most effective cinematic touches is that in nearly every scene, the camera is slowly swaying back and forth to give us a sense that we really are at sea. Something ""Titanic"" completely missed. We follow the journey of ten survivors through the inverted ship to their hopeful rescue--narrowly escaping fires, explosions, and flooding corridors every step of the way. The sets are epic and nothing less than spectacular. Especially the inverted dining room when the Atlantic Ocean comes crashing in, and the engine room which is now a horrifying twisted metal inferno. The cast is good, however Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters, and Stella Stevens are best. Hackman is our handsome hero, Winters is our unselfish caring mother, and Stevens is absolutely radiant (pre-capsize) and adds a welcome touch of humor to the mess. No, the movie is not perfect, and it is of course starting to look a bit dated. However the suspense and dazzling effects will keep you glued to your seat and you certainly won't be bored. Poseidon Adventure is a true classic. A must see for everyone--not just disaster movie fans.",The Poseidon Adventure

It still haunts me, almost thirty years later!Too bad the characters aren't well developed, which is the biggest 'minus' to this movie.

I have no idea how Hollywood gathered the cast of stars together, but they are terrible. The camp over-acting; the totally unsympathetic characters and the ham-fisted editing meant that it should have sunk without trace (dragging the Towering Inferno down with it, please). It took Gene Hackman and Hollywood a decade to recover. Do I care for any of the cast? Absolutely not! The rescue party should have gone to the pub and read a better script. The producers must have been selling ice to the Inuit and coal to Newcastle to pull this off. The delightful Shelley Winters never got out of the disaster mode and deserves a more dignified memory.

The Poseidon Adventure is based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Of course the book version and the movie version are completely different but some based on fact. Paul Gallico during World War 2, witnessed the Queen Mary almost capsizing and that inspired him to write the book. The characters in the movie are very good. The special effects are awesome. Though this movie is fictional, this tops all sea disaster films. The movie has a lot of realism in it, and a variety of characters. If you are a disaster film lover, this is the one movie for you! You will find out later on that you'll keep on going back and forth between scenes, and then before you know it, you are addicted to it just as I am, and you'll probably watch it so much you may know every line by heart!",The Poseidon Adventure

Towering Inferno kinda drags on, though after 9/11 its somewhat eerie. But Poseidon Adventure went the other way for me. It seems better than i remember. Pretty remarkable special affects. Great acting, Hey, Leslie Nielsen in a non comedy roll also. I always liked the beginning sequence with the ship in bad weather and that kid makes it to the pilot house. I was that kids age when this came out and i remember saying, no way in heck would I have done that. Whenever i hear that Morning after song, i think of this movie.

160,GeneralUrsus,The Grand Daddy of Disaster Films and an Epic Adventure,10,29 June 2013,"Without question one of the all-time, most exciting adventure films ever made. What stands out particularly about this classic is that it was made long before things such as blue screen and computer graphic imaging reared their ugly heads. All of the startling and captivating effects in this film were accomplished by actually turning sets upset down, outlandish stunts and highly creative production design that gives the audience a first hand feeling of an upside down ocean liner bobbing on the high seas.The POSEIDON ADVENTURE is the grand daddy of the disaster film. In addition to it's eye popping effects it sails on the merits of its first rate cast. Jack Albertson and Shelly Winters are perfect foils as a retired married couple, Red Buttons exudes pathos and great likability as the shy loner, Ernest Borgnine unleashes bravado and fury as the stubborn New York cop who continues to oppose preacher Gene Hackman every step of the way throughout their escape attempt to the ships' hull.Hackman is also very strong playing a role completely opposite of the no holds barred Poppeye Doyle in the FRENCH CONNECTION however with equal fervor and determination as he seeks to deliver his desperate band to safety. A young Pamelue Sue Martin pines for Hackman while her younger brother Eric Shea provides some timely laughs along with ship board knowledge.Director Ronald Neame does a superb job navigating his actors around the real ship the Queen Mary docked in Long Beach, California however, through camera effects the ship appears to be cruising the far reaches of the ocean. Neame creates terrific suspense and packages a wonderful twisty, adventure. The POSEIDON ADVENTURE has developed cult status because it is such a thrilling and exciting story brought to life by gut wrenching special effects, top notch performances and a wonderful story from writer Paul Galico's original novel. Don't miss it.",The Poseidon Adventure
161,AVES-2,The Best Natural Disaster Film,8,3 April 2000,"The Poseidon Adventure is one of those movies I have seen at least once a year as long as I have been alive. I lived in Maine when I was a kid and we loved our natural disaster flicks. Of all the great disaster movies from the 70s, this has got to be the best one. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Roddy McDowall, Leslie Neilson, and the list goes on.The basic plot goes like this. The Poseidon is a cruise ship out for its last voyage and it is New Year's Eve. The guests are all celebrating while deep beneath the ocean's surface an earthquake is happening. The earthquake sets off a huge tsunami and the ship is knocked upside down. In order to be saved, a small group of people heads for the engine room at the bottom (make that top, since the ship is upside down) of the ship. At first, the ocean claims hundreds of the passengers until they are whittled down to about 10 people left. From here there are plenty of tense moments and a power struggle for control of the survivors. Typical disaster movie fare but done rather well.This movie is a great main event for a disaster film weekend.",The Poseidon Adventure
162,jaiken007,Film vs Novel,7,1 January 2001,"What I found most interesting about The Poseidon Adventure was that the point of the movie and the point of the the book are diametrically opposed. **WARNING-SPOILERS AHEAD** In the movie everyone who stayed behind died. In the book they are all saved, in fact one of them is still drinking from his bottle of champagne and dressed in his evening clothes while the followers of the Reverend are in tatters and covered in oil and slime. The little boy, who is saved in the movie wanders off and just disappears half way into the book. The novelist, Paul Gallico, also wrote all of the Mrs. 'Arris goes wherever novels. I think that he and Irwin Allen had vastly disparate views on how the universe operates.",The Poseidon Adventure
163,JiaQiLi,Truly a Classic in the Genre of Disaster Movies,9,11 October 2006,"I was a little boy when I first watched it. But Gene Hackman's character is still sticking in my mind. I purchased the DVD several days ago and I watched it today. Wow! It is so intense and rich. Given the fact that it did not have any digital techniques, the special effects deserve even more credit. The waters are real, according to the DVD's bonus features (I own the special edition).I got emotional and tearful towards the end. The characters' development flourishes the entire movie. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" wins my heart not because of its visual effects, but because of its acting and character developments. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine excel in their roles, particularly with their disputes and quarrels. I also like Shelley Winters playing Mrs. Rosen. She does a fabulous job in the swimming scene.Disaster movies are usually not my taste because most of them simply feed the audience with special effects. However, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is an exception. This is truly a grandmaster classic in this genre. I do not regret buying the special edition, making it one of my film collections.",The Poseidon Adventure
164,jamesharrah,R.I.P Ronald Neame.,9,18 June 2010,"I just found out this morning that the director ""Ronald Neame"" passed away. The director of one of the best disaster movies ever made.I have always loved this movie and have seen it over and over and over but have never tired of it. There is a reason for this. This movie, with all its cheesy moments, has a human connection. Drama. Unlike that dreadful remake ""Poseidon"" with all its CGI and lack of character development. You actually care about the characters in the original and in one especially, Mrs. Rosen. Her death scene was so overwhelming that it still breaks my heart to this day. ""Poseidon"" has none of this stuff. Its main focus is ""look how elaborate our CGI effects are"". Granted the capsizing scene is very good, but after that....it has nothing else going on for it. Whereas with the original after the capsizing (which I still think is quite impressive without the use of CGI...""Old School"" methods of disaster are best), we had a Christmas tree to use as an escape tool. The remake however? Broken staircase. I could go on and on about how bad the remake is but I wont.This is about Hollywood losing an iconic director who made one hell of a disaster movie to add to his movie credits. A classic that has not faded. The saddest part of this all is that Hollywood is dying as well. Because the directors and producers today don't really focus on the human aspect of situations. Its all about how loud and overdone they can do it.Us old timers who come from a time of good movie making, sits back at watch Hollywood destroy each classic they can get there hands on. Rumour has it ""The Wizard of Oz"" is next. Nothing sacred in Hollywood. Once again I want to say..""Thanks Ronald, for making a classic movie that has held up through all the years...Rest In Peace!""",The Poseidon Adventure
165,thismango,Entertaining disaster film with mystical subtext,6,14 February 2012,"This is an entertaining and exciting disaster film that still works without computer-generated special effects.More interesting for me, however, was the obvious symbolic subtext. It is somewhat eclectic, mostly Christian Gnostic but mixed with European paganism. We begin with an upside-down underwater world, reminiscent of the Celtic otherworld. The characters seek salvation by ascending through the upside-down ship, which makes it symbolically a descent at the same time, as they are heading for the bottom of the ship, referring to the ubiquitous myth of the initiatory descent into the underworld.The first stage of the escape takes place via a tree. Again, the tree is symbolically upside-down as its base is on the ceiling of the upside-down ship, another image from European pagan mythology.The Gnostic structure begins with a speech by the main character, a priest with a Nietzschean individualist will-to-power philosophy. After the disaster occurs, he is contrasted with the dull character of the ship's steward who encourages people to play it safe and stay where they are, resulting in certain death. The steward represents the exoteric Church, which leads people into the service of the Demiurge, the false creator God who wants to trap people in his illusory created world by withholding Gnosis from them as in the story of the Fall in Genesis. The priest character is the Gnostic Christ who leads people to salvation by revealing the falsehood of the Demiurge. He leads them to repeatedly risk death in order to escape certain death, which, taken together with his introductory speech, represents the radical self-assertion of the Gnostic initiate or the Renaissance Magus, who dares to know the inner reality of the Godhead for himself, through his own efforts. He attains apotheosis in a self-crucifixion which saves the other surviving characters.One is only left to ponder on the motivation of the director to go to such effort in order to construct a symbolic sub-plot that probably less than 1% of his viewers will understand or even notice. Secret personal satisfaction or an attempt at subliminal education in comparative religion?",The Poseidon Adventure

This is something I hope to get on DVD soon, if it's still around. Even if their is some death and scary moments, this is a good movie for the family. This movie however, contains some parts which are boring, and unneeded. It's also a tragedy where many people on the ship die. This could also use a little more action.

168,Mancini2000,All-time best classic...the pioneer of disaster films!,10,16 September 2000,"Since I've been 5 years old, this disaster movie from Irwin Allen has been the must see movie my whole life. I'm only 16, I've seen the teenslasher/drama flicks with the whole 'Scream' trilogy and 'Cruel Intentions' hits, but nothing has pulled my strings as this film has.
This 70's film, which nabbed two out of the nine academy awards it was up for (music and special effects), was the pioneer of all the disaster flicks. Poseidon is to credit for the spark of suspense movies such as Earthquake, The Towering Inferno, and Avalanche. When a cruise liner is capsized during a New Year's Eve voyage, the handful of survivors played by an all-star cast fight their way to the bottom of the now overturned boat. Battling rising water, boat-rocking explosions, out of control flames, and the race against time before the luxury liner sinks, only the toughest passengers come out alive.Gene Hackman, Shelly Winters, and Erniest Borgnine truly deliever with extrodinary acting talents put to use in an original and attention nabbing plot, making this film a golden classic for future generations.",The Poseidon Adventure
169,markjayaweera2003,The Poseidon Adventure is superb movie making,10,26 November 2019,"**Contains some spoilers**The Poseidon Adventure the 1972 is one of my favourite movies of all time. Few movies have moved me as much as this one. Everyone in the cast does an outstanding job. Gene Hackman was superb as was Ernst Borgnine. The movie should really be named The Poseidon Tragedy. Since pretty much everyone in the ship despite tremendous heroism dies. There is so much you can take away from the movie. Gene Hackman never giving up in spite of tremendous odds against them surviving is a triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity makes the ultimate sacrifice so even one person may eventually survive. You really feel for all the Characters in the movie who are all extremely selfless and likeable people and you feel for their loss. This movie is also true to life. There is no real happy ending. Only Pamela Sue Martin and her brother, Ernst Borgnine who wished he died in the ship with his wife rather than survive. This is a tremendous film. Puts into perspective what happens to people and how they are truly tested as people when tragedy and disaster strikes. The acting of Gene Hackman and Ernst Borgnine and their wives and partners were sublime. We are introduced to the lovely American actress Pamela Sue Martin who played Nancy Drew mystery television shows later in the decade and made a name for herself in American television. You really believed they the characters portrayed superbly acted by all concerned, lived the lives they led up to that point and what this disaster had done to them. I think the message of this movie is life is short it could be struck down at any time so make the most of it. Cherish your loved ones. Because you or your loved ones won't last forever.",The Poseidon Adventure
170,NYQueen82,This is my FAVORITE movie of all time,10,8 March 2005,"Spoilers!!!!!!So, I admit it. The Poseidon Adventure is my favorite movie of all time. While I realize that this is not the most stunning, well acted, and executed movie in history, I just love it. The story of survival is so important to me, people putting aside their differences to help one another is really cool. The Poseidon, as you might know already, is a cruise ship in the middle of the holiday season, taking passengers through the Mediterranean, when it is capsized by a rouge wave just after midnight on New Year's Eve. Ten survivors now ban together for a brave climb to the bottom of the ship (which is now over head). A few don't make it to the journeys end, dying so suddenly and you are left with no time at all to mourn. The hardest loss for me was Belle Rosen. For one thing, she has age and her weight to fight with all the way through, and she dies saving everyone else, a true example of human sacrifice, putting the needs of other people before your own. The scene brings me to tears every time Iwatch it. I recommend that everyone and their mother see this movie, and I won't get mad if it doesn't wind up being your favorite, you gave it a shot, and that is all that matters.",The Poseidon Adventure

172,deetdee12,"Ham, Cheese and Mucho Male Fantasy",5,4 January 2009,"I strongly suspect either Mrs. Irwin Allen was considerably younger than Mr. Irwin Allen or he at least wished that were the case because except for Manny Rosen (whose wife is the same age and chubby, but incredibly saintly), every guy has a waaaay younger, waaaay hotter lady hitting on him. Two of them sporting hot pants, no less! Not only do studly macho men like Red Buttons, Ernest Borgnine and Gene Hackman have women 20+ years their junior to rescue and comfort, but they get to chew lots of scenery. While spouting lots and lots of self-righteous, pompous dialogue. What more could a middle-aged to old man ask for? I honestly would have preferred (and believed) Roddy McDowel paired with Carol Lynley. Though Roddy was only 9 years younger than Red, Roddy looked like he was 30 years' Red's junior, his character had already spent time gazing dreamily at Carol Lynley's ""Nonnie"" (was that meant to be some swingin' singer name?)and they actually had chemistry together (Carol and Red didn't do such a hot job of hiding their mutual dislike).I found the references to Stella Stevens' hooker past hilarious. Guys ""looked familiar"". Really??? She remembered her tricks from her street walking days? And they remembered her? This was especially entertaining when she talked about a ""young officer"" who looked familiar. If he was young and this was recent, why was he paying for your rapidly whithering butt, Stella (sorry, but she was 36 at the time and looks at least 10 years past that)??? And if this was more of a distant past thing, then I'm sure he doesn't remember you and eeeewwww, child molestation.I also loved how hip, radical Reverend Gene always wore his turtleneck and jacket---lest you forget he was a hip, radical reverend (or maybe he just wanted to be Banacek).All in all, entertaining in a campy, silly, overacted to the max way.",The Poseidon Adventure

The movie tells the tale of a group of people that have survived the turning over of their ocean liner. It shows you their trek through the ship. The thing I like about this movie is that it lets you get to know all the characters and then BANG they die one by one untill there are only a few left when the movie ends.

Until I have seen this film in adult age, I remembered only the scene with the big wave (I sat in the third row in the cinema with had a very big screen) and scene with Gene Hackman when he is hanging above the fire. I think this is one of the best movies 70s. It has good idea and good actors starring here. You cross one's fingers to all who survive.For me it's a very jolly memory to my mother which saw this movie with me then and this movie was her favorite too.",The Poseidon Adventure
175,damo1971,Excellent Disaster Movie,8,8 May 2006,"I always wonder what makes people go to watch disaster movies. In fact saying that you enjoyed a disaster movie and watching people during a disaster should hardly be cheerful watching. Though like a lot of things, the reality is sometimes different. The Poseidon Adventure, like most disaster movies is fairly easy to know what is going to happen next, you know that some people survive and some don't, those that don't seem to be the ones that argue with the leader of the group (or star actor) who has always seem to have a knack of making the right decision. To a certain extent though I think these points can be fairly irrelevant as the 'enjoyment' comes from watching the journey beginning to end. Answering my question in the first line, i think like most people, when you watch a good disaster movie it can have a positive message in that no matter how bad things get there is often a way out. As for the film, I thought the acting was really good, the chemistry between the characters was good, though at times a little clichéd. And the 'special effects' were excellent for the early seventies. All in all I thought it was a very good film.",The Poseidon Adventure
176,rowdybuschfan,A disaster film that keeps you on the edge of your seat,8,9 February 2018,"I have seen many disaster films in my day but The Poseidon Adventure is truly a film that will leave you on the edge of your seat because each moment after the being hit by a tidal wave is unpredictable. The survivors have to find a way out of the ship and a preacher (Gene Hackman) has to lead them out that becomes dangerous and often scary situations they face. Each cast member played their parts with emotion that becomes dramatic at times. All in all I thought this was better then the Titanic. I know they did a remake of this film in 2005 but as I always say, stick with the classic.",The Poseidon Adventure

The stock characters, artfully designated in the opening frames are no longer drawn from the ethnic range, but there's just as much bilge, just as little ballast in the Poseiden selection. Thus Gene Hackman, activist preacher, all thumbs and mouth; Ernst Borgnine, red neck detective(she was the only thing I ever loved); Steila Stevens, gritty hooker (get outta her you s.o.b.); Carol Lynely, whining rock singer (I can't I can't), Red Buttons, haberdasher with heart (you can you can); and Shelly Winters heavy Jewish grandmother (That's what life is all about).

The hero isn't some ripped moron leading people through outrageous obstacles while shooting bad guys and what not.  It's a plain and simple movie about survival.  Reminds me a little of 12 Angry Men in some scenes, but it lends to the movie well.  I mean, how would u react if you were trapped in a sinking ship with a revrend, a cop and a hooker and a singer??  Superb acting contributed by some, and not so out standing provided by some as well.  Hackman & Borgnine never miss.  Music is a cut above, but I would expect no less from John Williams.  Some gripping moments will surely grasp (if at nothing else) your sense of pitty for these people.  Later remade as Daylight with Stalone and met with a less successful story.  Over all, well done.",The Poseidon Adventure
181,jeurorotten,"Wolgang...Wolfie...No! No! Irwin Allen Rules, Donchya Know?",9,20 January 2006,"Like many here (and on other sites)I am a die-hard fan of Irwin Allen's 'The Poseidon Adventure'. I was 9 years old when the film was released by 20th Century-Fox, and I can clearly recall being figuratively glued to the TV screen whenever the trailer was shown. Likewise, I would turn up the radio when ad spots for the film came on. I also scanned the newspapers and would ""Ooooh!"" and ""Aaaaah!"" over the print ads. I truly think I drove my family insane - or, they thought ME insane - for my obsession with this film, even before it was released! In short, my older brother took me to see it here in Toronto in 1972 - and I was HOOKED, and continue to be so. I remember leaving the theatre literally shaking from the experience.I cannot explain my illogical yet very real attachment to this film. HOW many times did I play 'TPA' in our family swimming pool? HOW many times did I drive my mom insane by flipping over the couch and knocking over the dining room chairs while creating my own capsize experience? LOL. Great memories. That said, I loved the art direction and the whole 'feel' of the film - you truly felt as if you were on-board the S.S. Poseidon. Incidentally, this film, after 'Alien', has the BEST tag line ever - ""Hell, Upside Down"".John Williams score for the film - classic, haunting. The music is so ""sea adventure""! William Creber's art design - Superlative. Special effects - Still hold up. This was BEFORE friggin computer generation. THIS is the REAL McCoy, folks. Kurt Russell? Richard Dreyfus?....and the rest who - will someone please tell me WHO the HELL these people are - please. Mr. Petersen, with all due respect, the whole success and longevity the original Irwin Allen film enjoys is MAINLY BECAUSE of the all-star, stellar (including Stella - *wink*) cast! Not only just 'stars' - this cast contained ACTORS and ACTRESSES. Also, in my opinion, another reason the 1972 version is still spellbinding is because of the awesome (and manually created) special effects. The computer generated crap is just that - crap. Give me Linda Rogo - ""Mike, I saw a young officer on deck the other day - and he looked pretty DAMN familiar - even with his clothes on!"" *Stella Stevens (Who has also played a NUN in ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" - ROCKS! Give me Mike Rogo - ""Do you know what it means to be invited to sit at the Captain's table - on New Years Eve? I'll tell ya what that means - it means the whole idea of those women looking down on ya is a lot of bull!"" *Ernest Borgnine RULES! Give me Reverend Scott - ""Pray to that part of God within you - and that part of God will be fighting with you - all the way."" *Gene Hackman is IT! Give me Belle Rosen - ""No. When we get to Israel, we're staying put. Just think - our grandson is 2 years old already, and talking - we've never even seen him."" *Rest in peace, Shelley Winters. You had a lot of guts, lady - a lot of guts. Give me Mannie Rosen - ""He runs on time, like a train - ahh, you and trains!"" (Can someone explain WHAT the hell this man was talking about here? LOL) *Jack Albertson - I loved you in ""Willy Wonka"" - I loved you in TPA - a class act. Give me Susan Shelby - ""That's heavy, Robin - r e a l heavy."" - NOTE: Pammie, LOVED your fire engine red hot pants and great legs! Also loved the way you and Ernie Orsati boogied down on the dance floor in the ballroom! BIG KISS for Pammie! *Oh, Pamela, how do I love thee? I worship at your Susan Shelby altar. ............ahem.... Give me Robin Shelby - ""I've surfed up to 18 feet - but these look more like 30."" *What the hell ever became of Eric Shea? Anyone? Give me Nonnie - ""Teddy, wake up - there's something we have to do."" *Carol Lynley - blonde, go-go booty-licious - a fine actress. Give me Martin - ""I would have danced to his music - if I had had someone to dance with."" *Red Buttons - gotta love that name! Give me Acres - ""There is no other exit from this area, sir."" *Roddy rules, too Give me Captain Harrison - ""You irresponsible bastard."" ""The Poseidon is too fine a lady to be rushed to the junkyard on her last voyage!"" *Leslie Neilsen - a fellow Canadian - and what a guy!

182,frankzappayay,Wow what a film,9,21 January 2006,"They don't make 'em like this anymore.The Titanic was alright but... even amazing modern special effects couldn't help it compare to this film.It tugged at my heart strings in the first half hour... It sets the scene and character development and stuff... in the first half hour. It sets the mood and builds meaning in the first half hour. Then the disaster itself happens within like 1 minute. It doesn't draw it out and try to over dramatise anything. Its dramatic enough. Its also quite horrific and chilling i thought.. people falling to their deaths and getting squashed to death and loved ones dying... Its pretty hardcore.I love films like this :) Just really well made and well acted and well written and doesn't cheesify stuff.They managed to fit a few laughs in there too.. And there's thankfully very few ""OMG NO!!!!!I'm NOT DOING THAT!!!"" women who you just know are going to die and just annoy you. In fact the only character who i can remember as being annoying like that was Ernest borgnine's(sp) character, but thankfully he isn't overly annoying.Just a great film. I love finding an old classic like this on TV which I've never seen before.",The Poseidon Adventure
183,catrandom,Great effects sunk by a dreadful script,1,17 September 2000,"This rather alarming film stars a young Gene Hackman in as about as bad a performance as he ever gave. Of course, his character  -- a self-described ""renegade"" preacher -- is about the most arrogant, pretentious, bullying nitwit ever passed off as an adventure hero. The preacher's bellowing hostility and vicious emotional manipulation might have been something interesting and different if the script didn't seem so unaware that the character is, well, a jerk. The other male characters are pretty much stock types, though the always-reliable Roddy McDowall as a hapless ship worker is dignified and touching.The women do even worse than the men -- among them are a bitchy ex-hooker, a starry-eyed teenager with a crush on the boorish preacher, and a hot-pantsed halfwit of a lounge singer who frequently becomes paralyzed with terror and has to be comforted in the manly arms of Red Buttons.The single female character with any depth at all is Shelley Winters' sweet Jewish grandma, whose swim through the flooded propellor room ultimately makes it possible for the others to be saved. A generation of unkind jokes aside, her sensible, brave performance is the best thing in this very silly movie.",The Poseidon Adventure
184,raymond-x-jacobsen,One of the best films of all time,10,15 January 2007,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and have watched it numerous times since then. There is no comparison to the two remakes that came out---both pieces of crap. The original has it all---an all-star cast that shines, great effects, and most of all a story that grabs you from the very beginning. I find it interesting that so many people blast it for the ""hammy"" acting. Sorry, people, but these characters are REAL---I know people like the Rosens, the Rogos, the preacher, all of them! I found the portrayals dead-on, and very realistic for the situations that confronted them. They developed these personas in such a short period of time to make you care about them, that's where half of the tension comes from in this film. The special effects still hold up remarkably well for todays CGI-induced public---the capsizing scene still gives me the shivers. Of course, most of this movie is lost in its cropped format---it has to be seen in all of its widescreen splendor. Airport and this film are to me the granddaddy of all disaster films---they incorporate the best that soap-operas have to offer, along with top-notch casts and special effects.

Now as an adult I hear the goofy dialogue and notice some things that make me laugh a bit.  Even though, the show is GREAT.  My wife and I bought it and many friends who are in their md 20's have watched it for the first time with us and loved it.The film was a massive hit when it came out and it deserved to be a hit. The acting is good while some dialogue is stupid.  The interaction between the characters is what you'd expect from a bunch of strangers from different walks of life being forced to come together in a disaster.  EVERYONE wants to take the lead so fights would happen.  Imagine something happening in your own city or town.  How many people think of themselves as the LEADER?I have to say that BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is atrocious.  I tried to like it but I HATED IT!!  Another all star cast but what a terrible idea for a film.   Michael Caine and Sally Field must be embarrassed (but richer) for that film.I don't think Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Pamela Sue Martin, Leslie Nielsen or Eric Shea feel humiliated for appearing in such a great film as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.",The Poseidon Adventure

Not only I like the genre but it is so well done that I cannot ignore film crew ability to create a real touching story. The more I see it the more I like it. When a movie makes that effect to me then it's gonna be one of my favorites.I watched it today in my home language for the 100th time and not only I liked more than ever but I cried. At first I had some in my eyes during some sad scenes and at the end I really cried for sure feeling the same as the characters.

The publicity was great (TV Trailers and movie previews) I remember scanning the movie ads in the newspaper awaiting its release at the local movie house. It was a great family event too. I recall the theater being sold out for weeks at a time and see the crowd surrounding the building! This was a time when Panavision was still a big deal. The movie seemed so real mainly because of the music, sound and wide screen effect. The tidal wave seemed so real it appeared to ingulf the theater! I recall Shelly Winters on the Merv Griffin show I think she was describing how she had to put on so much weight because she wanted the part so bad. Wise choice! I recall mom saying you know she was once a very beautiful slim and trim starlet in the 1940's? I was shocked to say the least. I loved this movie so much I still have my ViewMaster slides on it! This was when there wasn't all this new computer animated special-effects junk we see now a days. There actually some of the best men and women stunt people used for those horrific scenes! I once had the behind-the-scenes book about the making of the movie but it has disappeared. However, when I saw the VHS I grabbed it and have worshipped it since!

190,hamlet65,A lesson from the past,10,12 August 1999,"While ""Poseidon"" may never be known as the greatest movie of all time, it does have its merits.  One need only look at the junk it unfortunately spawned (ie.ARMAGEDDON).  The characters in Poseidon may seem cartoonish to some, but at least you care about them.  People always say that before the ship turns over the dialogue is wretched.  I think its fine -haven't you ever been to a wedding where you are seated with complete strangers - how in depth do your conversations go?  Nowadays, I find that ever character appears to be auditioning for the Comedy Store -it's a constant barrage of one-liners.  The strength of Poseidon is that the one-liners are left to the Rogo's (who are like Ralph and Alice Kramden on sea) and the other character play their roles straight.  Poseidon is a film which, I believe has stood the test of time.  If it were released today -like Star Wars it would accord itself well and perhaps teach new directors that you can have a great action flick with good acting and suspense.",The Poseidon Adventure

192,fzane,Not just a disaster movie as so many here are saying,10,7 June 2019,"This film has too MANY undercurrents of emotion, character, and lessons of life to be called a ""disaster movie"". For me, the disaster part came secondary to the characters and their development throughout. Each character's karma tokens are tracked, and each gets what they deserve, even Reverend Scott who gave his life, but only after being saved by Mrs. Rosen who could be considered the true hero. The long look Reverend Scott gives her after she saves him then dies in his arms speaks volumes. He knows he could very well have to give his life as well, and when the time comes he does so with a fury so inspiring that Mrs. Rosen would have been proud. There isn't any grown person here who hasn't yelled at God at one point in their lives, and Reverend Scott screaming at God to take him instead broke me down. I realized right there, that this is no ordinary ""disaster"" movie, and deserves to be called something else. Perhaps a psychological disaster movie? I dunno, but it's definitely in it's own genre altogether, and i haven't seen anything like it since. I'll always cherish this movie as a growing experience, and one that I always used to watch with my Grandma (who reminds me of Mrs Rosen). RIP Grandma!!! I love you!! :-D",The Poseidon Adventure

It seemed so real!Now some 30 years later - well it's almost comedic - the over the top acting is a must see. Gene Hackman seems to yell all his lines, Borgnine couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in this one, Roddy McDowalls plunge and subsequent death by splashing water is marvelous, and Leslie Nielson, well lets just say this must be the role that inspired Airplane!Some other incredible moments - keep an eye on any time the survivors are walking anywhere - I swear it takes them 10 minutes to walk 10 feet. And my favourite - the ending where the rescuers find the group of 6 survivors and are more than happy to take off in their helicopter and leave behind anyone else who might be alive in the ship.This is a classic.And thank goodness we've come such a long way with movies in the last 30 years.",The Poseidon Adventure

The scene when the cruise ship turns over is especially awesome.  The actors are well cast.  There is just a sprinkling of comedy to take the edge off the drama.  Gene Hackman plays his part well.

I think the mere fact that there are 22 pages of reviews for this movie speaks volumes. All movies become dated after so many years. But that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this one. It's great to see these actors in their prime giving it their all under trying conditions. No CGI or stunt doubles here - they did it all (or most of it). As a kid, I remember watching Shelley on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson describing the movie. You could tell she was so proud of the movie and her work in it. They showed the clip of her swimming underwater and you knew right then you HAD to see this movie. Yes I'd like more diverse actors/characters and the kid is annoying. But I agree with an earlier reviewer that there are more interesting characters and back stories in this movie than Titanic. Yes there are implausibilities, yes there is scenery chewing dialogue, but who cares? There are also some poignant moments and you've got all these fabulous actors being drenched and beat to hell climbing to the bottom of an upside down cruise ship! Who will make it/who won't? It's 1972 American movie making, and you are there, so grab some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle.",The Poseidon Adventure
198,petermartineditor,One of the best films ever made.,10,26 December 2015,"As opposed to the moron who currently has his review on the main page, who casually said ""the cast doesn't matter -- what matters are the special effects..."" well, all I can say to that is: ""thank God you're not in the film business, pal!! Because brother, you haven't got a goddamn clue.""Make no mistake: the cast is EVERYTHING in this film. That's why it's a great movie... along with a fantastic script, great sets and perfect editing that moves the story along at a thrilling pace. And speaking of the cast, in my opinion it's an absolute crime that Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Carol Lynley didn't all win Academy Awards -- or at least nominations -- because they are all superb. In fact, every performance is powerful and believable, adding to the drama and emotion and constantly pulling the viewer into the scene. Because of these performances, the film is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking... NOT because of the special effects (which are fantastic, incidentally, courtesy of the great L.B. Abbott).A good lesson in how NOT to involve the audience can be seen in the multi-million dollar turd of a remake, directed by some clueless idiot whose brain apparently works the way the aforementioned reviewer's does. In the remake, the effects are EVERYTHING and the cast is basically nothing. Not that Richard Dreyfus and the others don't do a good job. They do. But with the lame writing and unsympathetic characters, no one gives a crap. That's why the film failed.In ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" however, every scripted word counts, and every second of valuable screen time matters, dramatically moving the story along, building unbearable suspense and audience involvement. It's a great lesson in filmmaking, which clueless amateurs like Tarentino obviously never bothered to learn (as so painfully demonstrated in his latest snore-fest, ""The Hateful Eight.""As directed by the great Ronald Neame, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is not only the greatest of the 70s disaster films, it's one of the most dramatic and exciting adventure movies ever made.",The Poseidon Adventure

I don't know what it is about this film but I just cannot get enough of it.The stand-out performance for me here comes from Stella Stevens as the acid-tongued reformed hooker Linda. This woman spends most of the film in a grimy pink shirt with running mascara and haphazard hair but looks absolutely gorgeous - despite those clunky silver platforms!! I love the shot of Linda slouched in the bottom left of the screen swilling from a whisky bottle while Ernest Borgnine and Jack Albertson are debating whether to ditch Gene Hackman and follow the doctor and the nurse in the bee-hive wig! Carol Lynley quite often gets a bagging for whining but I thought it a good performance as she wasn't really given a lot to work with script-wise and yet turned Nonnie into a memorable character (even if sometimes I did want to leave her there blubbering in the air shaft!) Gene Hackman's performance for me was a little over-the-top and as others have noted, he shouts....A LOT....Roddy McDowall and Arthur O'Connell didn't really get enough screen time to stand out much. Red Buttons is good, but I can just see Gene Wilder as fantastic Martin, a perfect role for him, and of course everybody loves Shelley Winters as the kindly and cuddly Belle Rosen.An absolute classic which will always have a special place in my heart.",The Poseidon Adventure

Just listen to the Main Titles it shows an ominous enemy (the rough sea) is battling against them but somehow it also personifies the courage and resolve of the people on board. A most beautiful introduction which should draw people into the movie like it did me when I first saw it at age 10. These Poseidon remakes couldn't even hold a candle to this wonderful score. All in all a fine cast that did a great job despite the rather pedestrian script they were dealt and who can forget ""just panties what else do I need"" :) For my part Borgnine, Winters, Hackman and an honorable mention to Leslie Nielsen as The Captain and Fred Sadoff as the ""bastard Linarcos"" If you want to wax nostalgic then definitely watch this fixture of the 1970's.",The Poseidon Adventure

Its about the cruise ship POSEIDON that is capsized on the early hours of New Years Day. The ship contains such stars as Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Carol Lynley, Roddy McDowall, and Shelly Winters. They have to escape the grand dining room, flooding corridors, upside down kitchens, vertical shafts, and a lot more obstacle's to brave. The acting of the actors are good, especially Shelly Winters as the former swimming champion. Director Ronald Neame creates characters you care about and cranks up the tension with the claustrophobia and the thought of impending doom. The model of the Poseidon is impressive. The supporting cast contains Jack Albertson, Stella Stevens, Pamela Sue Martin, Arthur Connell, Eric Shea. Leslie Neilsen plays the Captain in a straight face role, and Fred Sadoff plays Mr Linarcos, the ships accountant, but they go out early in the movie. The Poseidon Adventure is an enjoyable film, with a stellar cast. 10 out of 10!",The Poseidon Adventure
205,pjheberling,One of my best memories from Junior High School,9,26 July 2006,"When the Poseidon Adventure premiered, in 1972, every kid in my 7th grade class wanted to see it. I know I wasn't the last one to see it, but it sure felt like it. Clearly the movie has flaws, but it's a great story and is highly entertaining. I watch it whenever I see it coming on TV. Its enduring appeal for me is the ""what would I do if I were in his/ her shoes?"" aspect that runs throughout the movie. You feel involved...as many times as I've seen it, I've never been able to just dispassionately watch it.My only regret is that the movie makers didn't follow the book more closely. The ending in the movie (no, this isn't a spoiler!) is almost a letdown if you've read the book. The psychological impact of the book ending was devastating for me, and because of my strange tastes in movies, I wish Irwin Allen had had the fortitude and wherewithal to more closely follow the book's ending. By the way, the book's author, Paul Gallico, is a great story teller and is incredibly versatile, having written entertaining books in several genres, from children's stories (""Thomasina"") to espionage thrillers (""The Boy Who Invented the Bubble Gun"") to, of course, the action/adventure of ""The Poseidon Adventure.""",The Poseidon Adventure

Although TPA may seem somewhat dated and cheesy today, the campy script is really a hoot! Many classic lines found here! Thank God for Stella Stevens' character...The actors are great, the camera-work and timing are great, and even the special effects are fairly impressive (particularly for the film's age). Actually, the capsizing scenes are far superior to the latest version's in many ways.If you have plenty of time on your hands, you can always watch both films and compare for yourself. If not, I would stick to the original. It may lack the massive budget and glossy CGI special effects, but it sure is more fun!",The Poseidon Adventure

That's not to say I thought it was a total stinker. I sat through the whole DVD only fast forwarding from time to time. The story got me in but I felt it was weighed down by all too regular histrionics from the characters. It was as if cast members were directed to go over the top to give each scene added punch. All I felt it did was slow down plot progression and undermine the credibility of the characters. It's a real shame too as this film had a very talented cast. I'm a big Gene Hackman fan and can only guess how much worse this flick would have been without him. Other notables such as Ernest Borgnine & Shelley Winters were capable of much better work.,The Poseidon Adventure

I finally saw it again the other day (after 30+ years), and I must say, it holds up pretty well. The whole plot of the movie can be summed up in one sentence: big boat turns upside down, and people try to get out. But along the way, we get to watch past greats like Shelly Winters, and future greats like Gene Hackman ham it up a bit as they try to get out of the turtled S.S. Poseidon. Even though the plot is simple, the director keeps the action moving along crisply through a series of small action sequences as the passengers clamber over one obstacle after another. It's also fun to note that there's a weird religious sub-text to the whole affair. Gene Hackman's character is a priest, and much of the drama in the movie revolves around faith and belief. He tries to get the passengers to have faith in him, and that his way to the promised land is up and out; another priest stays behind with the weaker passengers; Rogo's comments of doubt and so forth. Even the last dramatic moment has a bit of a religious twist -- can you guess what it is? Great fun in all!",The Poseidon Adventure

Okay, it's campy and it's the consummate 70s disaster flick, complete with ensemble cast.But when you put them up against each other, Poseidon Adventure is just leagues better than Titanic.  Titanic is over three hours, and centers around two characters.  In that time, the two characters are hardly developed at all, they're terribly one dimensional and probably could be summed up in about a sentence each.Compare this to Poseidon Adventure.  Stars off with a dozen main characters, and in half as much time, they all have their own personalities, quirks, and are real identifiable people.  And far from the Titanic tendency of stamping ""I'm gonna die"" on people's foreheads, in the Poseidon Adventure you don't know initially who's going to die- or at least not how or when anyway.The Poseidon Adventure is just a more interesting movie.

I remember cutting anything about the movie out of the newspaper, calling radio stations to request ""The Morning After"" and then buying the 45 and wearing it out. I attended a Catholic school, and in every art class I would draw pictures of ships and scenes from this movie: I'm telling you that this movie had a HUGE effect on me.

Great, well-developed characters, a great story, and great sets. Oh, and some interesting lessons on surviving a maritime disaster.Many, many years ago when ""The Poseidon Adventure"" came out, I was a freshman in college. As part of a Navy ROTC class we were studying survival at sea. Wrapping up the topic, our Navy instructor took us to see ""The Poseidon Adventure"" at the local theater. We watched the movie armed with notepads, pens, and flashlights (and yes, the theater management was okay with the flashlights). Our assignment was to on the left side of the page note everything that the characters ""did right"" while trying to escape the ship, and on the right side of the page note everything the characters did wrong. The following class period we turned in our notes and we proceeded to dissect ""The Poseidon Adventure"", and it did very well! Overall, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" ended up being an excellent instructional tool. Obviously, that wasn't its purpose, but it was such a well-crafted story and film that it went beyond entertainment, and reached a much higher level.And now, more than 40 year later I look back on ""The Poseidon Adventure"" as a wonderful example of the art of film making, and a wonderful way to spend roughly two hours.

The original 1911 version of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was actually being shown in the second class dining saloon the night of April 14th. Films were considered beneath most of the first class passengers but, of course, they were allowed to attend if desired. It began about 11PM and drew enough of an audience to have a repeat showing around midnight. Many times members of the orchestra would accompany the films. By the time the film was over (53 min. in length) viewers may have lost their lives as many of the lifeboats were already launchedThe film was based on the novel ""Futility"" by author Morgan Robertson published in 1898. Two of the film's stars were Donald Crisp and Arthur V. Johnson. Directed by John Emmerson. The title of the ill-fated ship in the book was named ""Titan"" quite a coincidence. Two evenings before the film shown was ""The Lighthouse Keeper"" with Mary Pickford. It proved popular and was shown again on the evening of the 13th. All the films scheduled for showing had nautical themes. So another bit of Poseidon/Titanic trivia.

A 90' wave is unlikely to be caused by an earthquake (yes, a vast moving mass of water, but not very high, is what causes a Tsunami, but would not be a threat to a liner in the middle of an ocean). And freak waves that high probably impossible in the med. Electricity and water equals sparks and fusing, yet everything in the film is light.

My parents and I sat in the balcony in Dec of 1972. The Gene Hackman Rev Scott character still has a tremendous effect on me, as his journey is quite a powerful one. I guess why I like the character so much is that he Questioned, which is what America was also doing at the time dealing with the aftermath of the Vietman conflict the year it was released. Ronald Neame who directed the film does a great job on the DVD extra's with his unique commentary. Its a must listen too. Personally I would love to see the film once again on the big screen and have gone as far as requesting it as a submission to the Clearview classic series which runs at the Zegfield movie theater in NYC a few times a year.

Through the arguments that Mike and Linda have, Capt. Harrison and Linarcos, even the kids.
