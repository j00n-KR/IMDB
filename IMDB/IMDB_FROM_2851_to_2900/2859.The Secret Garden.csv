0,TheLittleSongbird,What an enchanting adaptation of a beautiful book!,10,25 February 2009,"Some people complained the makers changed the message of the book. They didn't, or I don't think so anyway. If that was the case, that was the only thing they changed. The script is focused and the direction masterful. The book in my opinion is one of the most enchanting children's books ever written. The film is equally enchanting, and the director manages to spoof a spirited performance from the lovely Kate Maberly. Haydn Prowse was great as Colin, and John Lynch is suitably melancholy as the uncle. Stealing the show, however, was Maggie Smith as Mrs Medlock, the truly beastly housekeeper. The film itself looks beautiful thanks to the stunning cinematography, and I loved the Gothic darkness tone retained from the book. Another mention is the haunting and poignant music score, that makes me cry. What does work best of all is its simplicity though. I thoroughly recommend this and Little Princess, 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Secret Garden
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but hardly great",5,25 December 2015,"I recently read THE SECRET GARDEN by Frances Hodgson Burnett and it was pretty obvious that the material doesn't lend itself to film very well. It's a slim novel almost entirely lacking in incident and action; rather, it's a mood piece, designed to bring to life a magical place and the characters who inhabit it. This 1993 adaptation tries hard to do justice to the book, but the results are mixed.I was pleased to see that although this was an American-made film, the entire cast are British. However, the actors are a mixed bag, and for a lot of the time they struggle with a sub-par script that makes the kids annoying. Yes, Mary was bratty in the book, but she never felt irritating like she does here. I didn't much care for Maggie Smith's poor Yorkshire accent either, although Walter Sparrow (ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES) is excellent as the gardener.Some parts of THE SECRET GARDEN are very good, like everything featuring the robin (I have the horrible suspicion that a modern version would simply CGI the bird) and the scenes that actually stick close to the book (and have the same dialogue in some cases). But in the effort to make the subject matter more cinematic, everything has to be bigger and grander, with random stone ruins within the garden. It was much smaller scale in the book, and some of the magic is lost. Also, they add in extraneous stuff like the stupid magic ritual, and Colin's father is NOTHING like he was in the book.",The Secret Garden
2,SnoopyStyle,touching Brit movie with kids but maybe not for the kids,7,3 December 2014,Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) was born and raised in India. She didn't like it there with her neglectful parents. They die in an earthquake and she is sent to live at her absent uncle's Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire run by housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith). Her aunt died in childbirth 10 years ago and was her mother's twin. She is once again neglected as she explores the estate. She is an angry little girl but she's befriended by the cheerful servant Martha Sowerby (Laura Crossley). She discovers a locked abandoned secret garden and then her sickly cousin Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse).Mary is such an angry little girl and her cousin is just as bad. This could have been ugly with such unlikeable kids. However the point of the movie is that they find a true family with each other for the first time in their lives. It's very touching. The movie is tinged with a melancholy which may not be to the liking of little kids. There is not doubt a poetry in this and maybe this is not so much for the kids.,The Secret Garden
3,Hitchcoc,One of Movie's Greatest Tear Jerkers,8,5 January 2017,"This is the story of a little girl who has little to be happy about. She is part of a British imperialist family in India who are killed by stampeding elephants. She is left to fend for herself until she is collected and sent to live in England. She acts out and is very unpleasant, but is tolerated. At some point she meets a young girl who sort of takes her under her wing and puts up with her tantrums. They find that there are places everywhere to explore in the big house and the grounds. They do from time to time hear some whimpering on the other side of a wall. Their investigations reveal a crippled boy who gets his only satisfaction watching others play. This sets up the rest of the film. Mary Lennox, the little girl, suddenly has some purpose in her life and that's what drives things to the conclusion. Of course, this is one of the world's greatest children's books.",The Secret Garden

Along with ""Troll"", I can definitely see it. Of course, the two are wildly different, but there are some aspects of it being (British) children in a mystical environment. One cannot help but notice the appearance of Maggie Smith.While I was not as crazy about this movie as some people are, it definitely has charm and I can see it being really fun for kids.",The Secret Garden
5,jboothmillard,The Secret Garden,7,23 July 2008,"I knew that there was a recent film adaptation of The Secret Garden starring Colin Firth and Julie Walters, but I knew I needed to watch this version before considering it. It was the most critically acclaimed version, and one I only remember seeing once, probably in college, based on the classic book by Frances Hodgson Burnett, from scriptwriter Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands) and director of Black Beauty, directed by Agnieszka Holland (Europa Europa). Basically, ten-year-old Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) has become recently orphaned, and is sent from her home in British India, returned to England to live with her uncle Lord Archibald Craven (John Lynch). She was unloved and neglected by her late parents who were killed in an earthquake in India. With lack of love and having been ill-treated, Mary is cold and self-centred, and is so repressed she is unable to cry. She is unhappy with her new surroundings. Head housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock (BAFTA nominated Dame Maggie Smith), orders her not to leave her room and to keep out of the way. But strange noises lead Mary to explore the mansion on her own, and she finds a hidden door in her room leading to unoccupied parts of the house. She also discovers a large key in a jewellery box, but she is unsure what it is for and leaves it alone. When told to play outside, Mary discovers a walled garden, which has been locked and neglected since the death of her Aunt Lilias (Irène Jacob) ten years ago. She realises that the large key she found earlier unlocks the door to this secret garden. Martha (Laura Crossley), Mrs. Medlock's cheerful housemaid, befriends Mary, along with her younger brother Dickon Sowerby (Andrew Knott) who loves to be outdoors. Fascinated by the secret garden, Mary wants Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually becoming friendlier and happier in the process. When she is finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing that he wants nobody to enter the garden. She asks for permission to plant seeds on an ""unwanted"" part of the manor grounds. Lord Craven grants her permission, then claims he is leaving for an extended period. Confident that the garden will remain a secret, Mary and Dickon continue their work, growing close. Hidden away in the gloomy mansion is Lord Craven's son and Mary's cousin, Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse), who has been treated like a fragile, sickly invalid his entire life. He is a spoiled, demanding, short-tempered boy, like what Mary was, he has never left his room or learnt to walk, and is confined to his bed and a wheelchair. Mary eventually finds him, discovering that he was the source of the noises she was hearing. Mary realises Colin's difficult nature, but reaches out to him, helping him realise he is not really sick, and the outside world is not as dangerous as Mrs. Medlock has made it out to be. Encouraged by Mary, Colin goes outside for the first time. Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden, and Colin begins both a physical and mental healing process. Mary, Colin, and Dickon spend all their free time in the garden, where Colin learns to stand and walk. Anxious to show his father, Lord Craven is awakened suddenly from a dream of Lilias calling him home to the garden. He finds the secret garden and sees Colin walking and playing with the other children, he is amazed and filled with joy. Upon seeing her uncle, Mary runs off and bursts into tears for the first time in her life, she assumes she is unwanted and fears the garden will be locked up again. Lord Craven seeks her out and reassures her that she is now part of the family. Promising never to lock it up again, he thanks Mary for bringing his family back to life and reuniting them. Mary, Colin and Lord Craven embrace, Dickon informs his sister Martha and the rest of the manor staff of the good news, and they watch Lord Craven and the children with amazement. It ends with the children happily playing in the now fully restored and flourishing garden. Also starring Walter Sparrow as Ben Weatherstaff, Irène Jacob as Mary's Mother, Frank Baker as Government Official, Valerie Hill as Cook, Andrea Pickering as Betty Butterworth, Peter Moreton as Will, Arthur Spreckley as John, Colin Bruce as Major Lennox, and Parsan Singh as Ayah. Maberly is charming as the at first arrogant and slowly nicer leading girl, Smith does almost steal the show as the beastly housekeeper, and Prowse is likeable as the initially fussy disabled boy who regains his strength. It is a simple but good-natured and enchanting story, it makes full use of its colour and location, the garden itself is transformed remarkably, and the score by Zbigniew Preisner brings it to life as well, a satisfactory family fantasy drama. Very good!",The Secret Garden
6,moonspinner55,Doddering family film with overstated performances,4,25 June 2006,"Arty but stilted adaptation of Frances Burnett's 1911 novel about a young orphaned girl who comes to stay with her chilly relatives, eventually taking over their rotting garden and transforming it into a sanctuary. Famous story previously filmed in 1949 with Margaret O'Brien in the lead; here, young Kate Maberly isn't so much miscast as she is misplaced; inappropriately dropped into the tale, she's a too-modern tyke representing neither time nor place, and her youthful exuberance is rather exasperating. The handsome, careful art direction and design have led some to call the picture a breakthrough in live-action family films, but the pacing is too leaden and the narrative isn't rich enough for most adults. *1/2 from ****",The Secret Garden
7,grantss,"OK, but watch the 1949 version instead",6,31 August 2017,"Living in India, Mary Lennox, a young, privileged girl, is left orphaned when her parents are killed in an earthquake. She is sent back to England where she goes to live on her uncle's estate. It is a fairly isolated existence and she has to find things to keep herself occupied. She finds a sickly young boy...and a secret garden.A decent adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel. Sweet and reasonably interesting. However, lacks a spark to make it overly engaging.On the other hand, the 1949 version was brilliant: enchanting with an air of mystery and wonder. The performances by the children were spot-on and the chemistry between them worked perfectly.For whatever reason, this version doesn't get to that level of enchantment and mystery, The children are okay, but not as likable as in the 1949 version. The air of mystery hardly existed and is extinguished pretty quickly.Overall: not bad, but not compelling viewing.",The Secret Garden
8,Wuchakk,"Beautiful, reverent, awe-inspiring",9,8 June 2014,"To be honest, I remember seeing previews of this movie way back when it came out (in 1993) and thinking to myself, ""WHY would anyone want to see such a film and why would anyone make it?"" Well, about five years later it appeared on TV one night and I started watching, fully expecting to turn it off within 20 minutes or so. WOW -- was I ever wrong! What I saw was beautiful and captivating, artistic and entrancing -- filmmaking of the highest order. ""The Secret Garden"" is a movie of such artistic quality that it ranks up there with the hallowed original ""Apocalypse Now"" (although they're totally different genres). It's no surprise that Francis Ford Coppola had his hand in both pics -- he was, of course, the director of ""Apocalypse Now"" and he's the executive producer of ""The Secret Garden."" In any event, the cinematography is breathtaking and the score is awe-inspiring, ranking with the best in cinematic history.***PLOT SPOILER*** The story's about a spoiled 10-year old English girl, orphaned in India, who comes home to live on her uncle's vast estate in the early 1900s. The girl, Mary, finds herself trapped in a mysterious, colossal manor -- almost a castle -- tyrannically managed by a life-stifling witch, Mrs. Medlock, in the frequent absence of her uncle, Lord Cravin. Because Mary is intelligent, independent and sly she is able to reconnoiter the manor and learn its forbidding secrets. The biggest secret is that her aunt died ten years earlier and her son, Colin, still lives there, albeit confined to a bed, sickly and unable to walk. Her uncle never healed from this heartbreak.Mary discovers another secret in her explorations, a hidden garden, closed off and neglected since her aunt's death. After meeting the sickly and sad Colin, Mary inevitably finds a way to sneak him into the garden along with her pal Dickon. She senses that Colin isn't as sick as everyone is convinced; she knows the best thing would be to get him out of the dreary castle and the oppressive clutches of Mrs. Medlock. Mary and her secret garden are the keys to restoring health, life and freedom to Colin, Lord Cravin and the gloomy manor.***END SPOILER*** ""The Secret Garden"" is sort of a 1990's version of the outstanding ""Pollyanna"" with Hayley Mills (1960). Both pics involve a young girl restoring a spirit of joy and liberty to a lifeless community. The difference is that Mary is not even remotely the ""glad girl"" Pollyanna. In fact, look for the hilarious line from the old gardener who responds to Mary's puzzlement concerning her lack of friends.""The Secret Garden"" is no doubt labeled a ""children's film,"" which is a shame because it transcends such a limiting category. The ending's too quaint for my tastes but, nevertheless, this is a beautiful work of wonder and deep mystery, which can be enjoyed by people of all ages -- children and adults.The film was shot in England and runs 101 minutes.GRADE: A",The Secret Garden

10,elo-equipamentos,"Great and moving remake, however far away from its forerunner!!",7,20 March 2021,"The immortal novel of Frances Hodgson Burnett got this new colorful version, even though it's really good, nice going and painstaking work, but it's very fair from his forerunner of 1949 mixing black & white with some color sequences, the gap is abysmal, nonetheless the devising is the same in so poignant story, there's no way of not being moved with so charismatic characters.A ten years old English girl Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly) lives at India with their parents, sadly the girl is disregarded by his sociality mother and his often busy father, when they have a free time instead to care Mary, they spent their time on countless parties, one day an earthquake kills all them, Mary miraculously survives and has to go back to living with her sole kinsman alive on England, unfortunately her wealthy uncle Lord Archibald Craven (John Lynch) also lost his beloved wife which was the sister of her mother, he living in a large Castle on the countryside.Barely reaching there Mary wasn't welcome properly, firstly for his sorrowful and lonely uncle who denied see Mary at once, second by a sour matron Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who imply a hard time for so spoiled girl, the solution is setting up acquaintance with a friendly maid Martha (Laura Crossley) and his young brother Dickon (Andrew Knot) and walking around, suddenly she finds a secret garden aided by a bird, Mary shares with Dickon the news, however he already knew such place and its sadly story, moreover Mary also learns that has a sick cousin Colin Craver (Heydon Prowse) with frail health, living cloistered in a dark room almost out of sight.Slowing the charismatic Mary will changing the little boy which has her same age, opening the windows, allowing fresh air and sunshine that improves the boy's healthy, he also can't walk, then Mary and Dickon escape stealthily to know the secret garden, there Colin tries walk alone steady and overcame his psychological fear, anyway a movie about kindness, friendship and how is possible a small single soul changing all around, touching movie, nonetheless a little bit pasteurized and far-fetching contrasted with the original that is really million years ahead!!Thanks for reading.

11,Smells_Like_Cheese,An amazingly touching film,8,12 January 2004,"Ah, the many memories I have with The Secret Garden, I have to admit it, when I was a kid, I had this group of girlfriends and we always thought it would be so cool if we discovered a garden just like the children in this movie did. As silly as that sounds, the movie really got our imaginations going. Of course you grow up and you forget a little bit about the movies that you used to watch as a kid. But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.The recently-orphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in India to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundred-room house, Misselthwaite Manor. Mary, materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents, is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha, a Yorkshire girl working as a maid, and her brother Dicken, a boy who can talk to animals, befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden, which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life. Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have, turning him into a demanding, short-tempered, helpless boy. Mary, defying the orders of Mrs Medlock, discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition, but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin, Mary, and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform magic, and make the garden live again.The Secret Garden is always going to hold a special place in my heart, I absolutely adore this film and it brings back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. The children that they found to play Mary, Dicken and Colin were absolutely perfect and were great actors actually, I'm surprised they didn't move onto bigger things in their careers, but they had great chemistry and really brought the movie to life. The settings are gorgeous, the garden that the children created was so lovely and reminds me about all the wonderful things that spring brings, life. If you haven't seen The Secret Garden, I highly recommend that you do, it's a very special film that I'm sure you'll fall in love with as well.8/10",The Secret Garden
12,lasttimeisaw,What an ethereal child film it is!,8,3 May 2015,"What an ethereal child film it is! An adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's titular novel, and craftily constructed by Polish female director Agnieszka Holland with the sublime aids of DP Roger Deakins' transcendent cinematography (including some wondrous time-lapse shots), an equally unearthly score by Zbigniew Presisner, and a spiritually mollifying end- credits song WINTER LIGHT by Linda Ronstadt, THE SECRET GARDEN is a nonesuch in the realm of family movies.The said garden is located at Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire, England, where Mary Lennox (Maberly), a ten-year-old spoiled girl who recently lost her inattentive parents in India, now lives. Taken in by his uncle Lord Archibald Craven (Lynch) who has sorrowfully indulged in the loss of his wife since ten years ago an accident took her life (which actually happened in the garden, that's why Lord Craven ordered to close it forever), Mary is under rigid superintendency of Ms. Medlock (Smith), the stern housekeeper doesn't clearly doesn't care too much about her more than a thorn in the flesh. Mary is unhappy in her new environment, until she finds her aunt's garden, thanks to the guidance of a robin to show her the way (there must be magic involved!), at beginning, the garden seems dead, just like the solemn air in the hundred-room manor, with sporadic scream sounds from a young child which everyone dares not to mention. Holland has achieved a remarkable job to set the mood right, it is irresistibly captivating, even a tad spooky, which is reminiscent of the haunting ambiance in Jack Clayton's horror master work THE INNOCENTS (1961, 9/10). Soon, Mary discovers the secret behind the scream is from Lord Craven's 10-year-old son Colin (Prowse), who has been bed-ridden since he his premature birth (due to his mother's accident) and is treated as a fragile invalid ever since. Mary befriends with her new cousin, and she is destined to revive the garden and the family from the lifelessness which has been cloaking the entire place for too long.Kate Maberly is surprisingly laudable in her film debut to portray a young girl's leap from a sullen sport to an intrepid trailblazer in brining hope and wonder galore, harmoniously couples with the flourish nature's flow and fauna, what a natural chameleon she is! Her interactions with Heydon Prowse and Andrew Knott, who plays the farmer boy Dickon and can talk to animals, are much convincingly conveyed with an added layer of delicacy with both romance and jealous lurking around. Prowse also instigates a strong self-confidence rarely seen in a child actor in the confrontational scenes with Maggie Smith, their authority- juggling game may be a slip in the script, but certainly fun to behold in a movie as good- natured as this. Among the adults, Smith is breathtaking whenever she is on screen although she is playing her very stereotyped maiden calling card again, always something tender can be found under the harsh front. Whereas John Lynch solidly confers the peculiar 10-years lachrymal distress with adequate likelihood, which in a lesser hand, could be the weakest link in the fable. Made only two decades ago, now if we scrutinise the offerings pander to Generation Z, it is axiomatic that this film is a bona-fide gem beyond any comparison, particularly for its astonishing beauty created by its production team without the interruption of digitalised virtual reality and the unforced manner of how it imparts its positive messages on the viewers. A big bravo to the filmmakers!",The Secret Garden
13,Anonymous_Maxine,There is something to be said about the story of The Secret Garden when even such a skeletal film adaptation as this one can be so wildly entertaining.,8,18 February 2003,"This version of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden takes the novel and eliminates all but the most crucial elements to make sure the story makes sense, but there is so much left out from the book that it takes away a lot of the magic. Rather than have the garden act as a magical entity in itself, it is more of an escape from the creepy dreariness of Misselthwaite Manor, a gigantic monstrosity of a mansion that does justice to the enormity of the one portrayed in the novel but is such a brooding and unpleasant place that the escape of it overshadows the magical curiosity that should be entailed by the garden. The film creates a great sense of atmosphere, with the long hallways and the tremendously and unnecessarily elaborate living quarters that Mary is placed in, and we see some wonderful things as Mary sneaks around to explore the mansion, although she really only goes into one room and then her explorations are over.Kate Maberly delivers a wonderful performance as Mary Lennox, the spoiled little girl who is sent to live with her uncle, the reclusive Lord Craven, when her parents die of cholera in India, an event which never seems to affect her since her parents were always too busy for her anyway. Mary doesn't seem to care too much where she is being moved to beyond the fact that it is such an inconvenience for her, and she soon has to face the fact that she is no longer going to be waited on hand and foot like she was by her Ayah in India. Heydon Prowse also gives a great performance as Colin Craven, the young boy who is so extraordinarily spoiled that he has become literally incapable of caring for himself or even standing up. The young actors in this film are much more impressive than young actors often are (this is the kind of actor that is most likely to be forgiven for a bad performance because they're so darn cute), each portraying wonderfully the characters as they are presented in the novel. Andrew Knott as Dickon is the other major example, perfectly portraying the magical young boy who has a way with animals.The thing that makes the movie not compare to the novel is that there are some important things from the book that are left out of this film version, some of which I can understand being done for time purposes but there are some things that just should have been put in, in one way or another. There is nothing, for example, about the exercises that Colin indirectly learns from Bob Haworth in order to strengthen his legs, there's nothing about Colin's plans to become a scientist and an explorer and a lecturer (this kid wanted to be Indiana Jones and they didn't even mention it in the movie!), we see nothing of Colin's extravagant plans for how he should present his newfound health and strength to his father, there's very little said about the Magic that all three of them have found in the garden, and even Dickon's entire family (which is enormous in size as well as significance to the story) is left out entirely. These are just a few of the things that I noticed to be missing, and I'm sure the list goes on. The story itself is also hugely simplified, but if you take into consideration a film adaptation of something like Frankenstein, you can see that this could have been a lot worse. The 1933 film version of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel covered maybe 3-5% of the novel, which completely changed the meaning of the story and transformed Frankenstein's monster (Frankenstein is, of course, not the monster, but you already know that because you've read the book, right?) from an enormously intelligent creature who only wants to fit in to the world that he has been placed in and into a hulking, thoughtless beast. In this case, this version of The Secret Garden could have been a lot worse, but on the other hand, it could also have been a lot better, hence my conflict.For the most part, the story is here, which is a good thing. We know that the garden once belonged to and was loved by Lord Craven's wife, and we know that she died giving birth to Colin which is why Lord Craven locked up the garden forever and can scarcely stand even to look at his crippled son, who he fears will turn out to be a hunchback like himself (although neither of them look like hunchbacks at any time during the film). We briefly see Mary's life in India and we see a heavily diluted version of the part where she realizes what has happened to her parents, and then she is moved to Misselthwaite. The movie diverts from the book almost immediately, but mostly when Mary goes to Misselthwaite Manor. She is urged to go outside and explore by the endlessly patient Martha, and almost immediately runs into the secret garden. The grounds are bitterly cold and it's almost uncomfortable watching this portion of the film, which reminds me of other uncomfortable but wonderful films like Buffalo '66 and Affliction, but this is the sort of thing that replaces the real magic in the book. Rather than find the garden as a truly magical place, it is an escape from the dreariness of the rest of Misselthwaite. The robin is an important part of the story and it is found in the movie, but thankfully it is not presented quite as much as in the book. This is one of the only things that is fortunately subdued a little bit, since in the book the robin goes through a mating period and there is actually one chapter late in the novel where the robin and his mate have a conversation about Dickon and his strange friends, whom they're not too sure about. There are certainly some things from the novel that are left out of the movie with good reason, such as this scene where the narrative goes into the thoughts of the robins, which can only be disorienting and awkward unless it was done much earlier in the novel (and even then it would not have fit too well with the rest of the story). The ham-handed delivery of the moral at the beginning of Chapter 17 is also left out with good reason, but then there are little things changed as well, such as the simplification of the plot which takes away from the magic of the story as a whole, and even smaller things, like the fact that the command that Mary teaches Colin to tell her servants that he is done with them is changed from `You have my permission to go,' in the novel, to `I have spoken, all depart,' in the book. Did you ever see Sphere? That bad science fiction movie from 1998 that was based on the Michael Crichton novel? They did something similar in that movie, changing some of the names of the characters for no apparent reason. I can never understand why they would do things like that when making books into movies. On the one hand, I can understand that there are some books that could be made a lot better with a little tweaking here and there, but The Secret Garden is a classic novel that, with a few tweaks here and there, is most likely to be changed into a movie that could have been a lot better with a few small changes. Or, as it were, without a few small changes. This movie is sure to entertain and delight its target audience, but it should not be taken in place of the novel, which is hugely superior.I have spoken. All depart.",The Secret Garden
14,jamesrupert2014,Well done family film,8,21 February 2017,"This version of the classic children's book is truer to the story than the 1949 version starring Margaret O'Brien. Some liberties have been taken to shorten the period when Mary is the only child (or so she thinks) in the old manor, which helps the pace of the film (and avoids it starting to look too much like a ghost story to the uninitiated). The three child leads are excellent (and better matched to the characters' ages than the '49 cast) as is the adult supporting cast. I would have liked to hear more ""Yorkshire"" in the adult's voices (much emphasised in the book) but that might have required subtitles. The only part of the film that I felt was weak was the 'magic' ceremony with the torches, during which Colin 'summons' back his father. The whole scene seemed out of place and inconsistent with the children's backgrounds and earlier behaviours. The script writer should have stayed with the much subtler magic of love and longing - the core message, along with spring and rebirth, of the book.",The Secret Garden
15,freemantle_uk,An enjoyable family film,8,7 October 2012,"The 1993 adaptation of The Secret Garden is one of two major adaptations of novels by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Secret Garden sees Mary Lenox (Kate Maberly), a 10-year-old British girl who was born in India. She is a spoiled brat who has her own personal servant, but is emotionally distance because she was neglected by her parents. But after a massive Earthquake in India, Mary is orphan and sent back to England to live with her uncle. The Northern English manor is run by a harsh matriarch, Mrs Medlock (Maggie Smith) and limits Mary's access to most of the house. But Mary forms friendships with the servant girl Martha (Laura Crossley) and her brother Dickon (Andrew Knott) who has great animal taming abilities, discovers her aunt's secret garden and finds her 'sick' cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse).The Secret Garden does share similarities to A Little Princess, both feature young girls who grew up in India, have lost their parents in some form, both are forced to go to move to a foreign land, have to deal with an authoritarian figure, befriends a servant girl and there is a character who has a magical element to him. But there are differences as well: the main one being the central characters: Mary is a more selfish, spoiled character who has to learn to open up, show emotions, be kind and help her people whilst Sara in A Little Princess has to keep her imagination and kind spirit despite the hardships and lost she suffered. The actual story and setting for both stories is also different with Mary having to help to her cousin, lead to have a passion and learn about her family's past.In comparison to A Little Princess the direction is more sombre and bleaker tone. Director Agnieszka Holland shot the film using a grey fillers and added with the mostly winter setting and barren landscape of the moors gave the film a drowsier feel. Comedy, fantasy and whimsy is toned down and The Secret Garden is a much more grounded and serious film until the end. But it is a delightful family film for all ages and genders.As well as the Earthy look Holland brought there is also some fantastic music from Zbigniew Presiner: perfectly fitting for the film throughout. Those I am a sucker for choir music.The cast is great throughout the filmmakers did find some very talented young actors who gave very convincing performances. Many of them have gone on to have fairly successful careers beyond the film and brought out the interesting aspects from their characters. I personally thought Maberly was actually a better actress then Eleanor Bron was in A Little Princess and she did give a very emotional performance in that film. Smith is also a very formable present, as she is always is, and have very strange motivations to why she is treating Colin the way she does? Is it out of crudity, love or protection? It is up to the audience.The Secret Garden is a very good and strong family film that is serious minded and old-fashioned, but in a good away. I personally preferred The Secret Garden to A Little Princess and I speak as a fan of Alfonso Cuaron.",The Secret Garden
16,ianlouisiana,A High Victorian masterpiece,10,25 December 2005,"This exquisitely made film is a Victorian genre painting come to life.Mary Lennox is Thomas Cooper Gotch's ""The child enthroned"".The late 19th century middle and upper classes were obsessed by the idea of children and childhood,a preoccupation encouraged by the high infant/mother mortality rate due to paucity of medical knowledge and the lack of what today would be considered even the most basic hygienic practices. Despite the Industrial Revolution and the consequent leaps and bounds of technological progress childbirth and womens' health was very much a side issue in a patriarchal society.Colin's father has no interest in his son's upbringing despite - or,arguably,because of the fact that his wife,whom he clearly loved had died giving birth to the boy.He is an intelligent man and knows that such an attitude is not reasonable,but it is the status quo for a man of his position .That he loves and understands children is made clear by his attitude towards Mary and his defence of her against Mrs Medlock,but his gender and his own upbringing are not easy forces for him to overcome. And Mary is not an immediately attractive child.Orphaned by an earthquake in India,she is sent to England,where she has never been,to live with her uncle,bereaved husband of her dead mother's late sister. So spoilt and mollycoddled that she is unable even to dress herself,she soon comes into conflict with her cousin's governess/nurse/minder Mrs Medlock,and her cousin himself,an apparently sickly boy,bedridden,self-pitying and petulant.How she changes the lives of the boy,her uncle and Mrs Medlock is told in ""The Secret Garden"". It is a film made with loving care and attention.Every set-up is beautifully composed,perfectly colour-balanced and lit . The shot where Mary looks longingly out of the window is stolen from Sophie Anderson's ""No Walk Today"" and that is not meant as a criticism. The secret garden itself could have been painted by Helen Allingham. The long lingering close-ups of Mary's face,her eyes and hair superbly lit,recollect the almost mythologising aspect of Victorian child portraiture.Perhaps it takes a European director to reveal the potential for real beauty in the long hallways,sweeping staircases and secret passages in an English manor house.British filmmakers are often too concerned with post-colonial guilt and wracked with naive ideas of class conflict to give a balanced picture of life in Victorian England. The fact that Dickon is very much a village boy and several social strata below Mary and Colin is never referred to in the film. Instead he is depicted as a child of nature,almost a gypsy,born to country ways and in almost Buddhist-like commune with wild animals. The last scene,a tremendous long shot where he rides off over the moors on his white horse has a fine mythic echo to it. It would take a colder heart than mine to turn aside from the redemption through innocence proposition that is at the centre of ""The Secret Garden""",The Secret Garden
17,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Good movie based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's first-rate bestseller for all ages that will warm your heart and make you smile,8,5 July 2007,"THE SECRET GARDEN, in my opinion, is a good movie based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's first-rate bestseller for all ages that will warm your heart and make you smile. I really loved the things that Jess (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (Kate Maberly) had in the magical garden. Also, the only other person I couldn't stand at times was Colin. You'll see out why once you've read the book and seen the movie. The music was good, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's first-rate bestseller for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.",The Secret Garden
18,Lady_Targaryen,Beautiful and a classic,9,29 November 2005,"'Secret Garden' is a classic to watch anytime you want. The atmosphere in this movie is perfectly portrayed as being sinister and dark and I remember being 8 watching this movie and feeling the oppressive feeling of Lord Craven's mansion. Mary Lennox is a 10 years old English girl who was raised in India. She didn't like to live in India, but the thing she hated the most was the fact that her parents were selfish and never cared about her. One day, an Earthquake in India makes a big devastation and many kids stay orphan,including our lead character Mary Lennox. She is sent to England, to live in her uncle's mansion,since he is now her legal guardian. Mary, which is a cold,bitter,annoying girl who hates to be touched and with lots of angry inside her, meets Martha, a cool girl and servant who works in the mansion and treats Mary very nice( the opposite of Mrs. Medlock,the governess) and her brother Dickon, a sweet boy who makes friendship with the animals. One day,Mary discovers in her aunt's room a key. But it's not an ordinary key, is the key from the secret garden, a garden who once was the place where her aunt always loved to stay and that now is locked since she died. Mary ask Dickons to help her to restore the garden,but they both make it a secret. In the meanwhile, Mary meets her cousin Colin, a sick and spoiled boy who stayed all his life in bed, since everybody always believed he would die very young. It's beautiful to see the changes of Colin and Mary: He learns to be more confident and less pessimist, changing the paranoia of being all the time confined in his bedroom because of 'spores', to go to the garden and try to walk again. And Mary, who once was so bitter, learn how to be a kid and to smile.",The Secret Garden
19,rockman182,The Secret Garden (1993),7,11 February 2017,"I finally got an HBO subscription so now have many films at my disposal (I've seen most anyways but still). I also had this film on DVD lying around somewhere but finally decided to watch it. I wasn't very clear on what the film was about beforehand but the premise sounded like the family friendly fantastical tale that could be worth the watch.The Secret Garden is about a spoiled girl who lives in India until her parents untimely death. She is then relocated to her uncles mansion where she discovers she has a recluse cousin (who is hidden away) who is sealed off because he is ill and can't walk. They both travel out to a secret garden which seems to improve his health mysteriously. Along the way, the two form a connection despite initially butting heads. The film is based off the novel of the same name.The verdict is that this film makes for an enjoyable time. Its an older film so the film could use some digital enhancing to make some of the scenes more vibrant (ahem Blu-Ray treatment). The film has the charm of 90s children fantasy films that movies of today cannot really recreate. While thee child acting is not great and the accents (especially of the child maid) are horrible its forgivable when you think of the films market. The film's fantastical elements are undertold as it relies on the magic of the garden and placing faith in its spiritual abilities without actually seeing much on screen, which is fine.The film isn't an absolute must watch by any sense, nor is it something that many people will have heard of. It is however, a harmless film that captures a bit of the essence of children's films of the past while establishing inspiration amongst curious kids as they journey into something fantastical together. There's plenty of cute animals and naturalistic shots for those who would appreciate that sort of thing anymore. Its not a film that would be successful today because of its simplistic presentation and understated visuals, but its solid.7/10",The Secret Garden
20,TheOtherFool,Lynch is great...,5,30 March 2004,"Disappointing movie after Burnett's book (also known from Little Lord Faunterloy) about young Mary who moves back from India to England after her parents are killed in an earthquake. There she meets up with her nephew (bedbound Colin) and Dickon, a service boy. The three of them restore a neglected 'secret garden' and become friends while doing it.I'm gonna say it flat-out: the acting of the kids was disappointing. In particular the kid who plays Colin (and, as we learn, never acted again afterwards) is as wooden as can be. The Mary-kid has done a lot since this one but she's not that great either. That and the fact that the roles these kids are playing are highly dislikable and the pace is dreadfull make up for not the best movie around (mildly put). The older actors are great though: Maggie Smith is excellent as the tough Mrs. Medlock, who's job it is to protect young Colin and John Lynch is fantastic as the uncle. The scene where he finds out his son can walk is one of breath-taking beauty, but it takes forever to get to that point.In short: disappointing, could have been a lot better, 5/10.",The Secret Garden
21,blackmamba99971,A secret miracle,10,2 November 2010,"This was a very endearing film. To see a young niece who has never known turmoil in her life and is spoilt to a fault and also loses her parents in India by local troubles. She is then transported to her uncle's house where her cousin is supposedly terminally ill. Instead, and by happenstance, Mary (niece) uses her ability to see what is real is what is not. Thus by giving her cousin the chance to take his first step in his life than laying in his bed. Yet in the middle, is the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith) who uses her abilities to stop Mary from accomplishing her goal. And that is to keep poor Colin in bed. But through sheer determination and with the help of a young grounds keeper, Dickon (Andrew Knott). They all discover a secret garden which was supposed to be closed forever, until Mary and her unique green thumb re-creates the lush and beautiful landscape for which the manor is known for. This held all aspects of emotions, humour, innocence, sadness, anger, and above all, Love. This will give the home audience a unique perspective about how the will to live without bounds can over come the most difficult obstacles. The Secret Garden is a wonderful film on those nights where there is nothing to do, and it can show a family what a family is supposed to be about. Excellent cast, excellent music and beautiful examples of nature.",The Secret Garden
22,Just-A-Girl-14,Oh I'm getting so nostalgic...,10,18 March 2021,"I am a millennial. I was eight years old when this movie came out. I remember I got this movie for my birthday (the original cassette lol). I was really mesmerized with it. The huge mansion with its halls and secret rooms, the scary head housekeeper, the kids, the animals, the missing uncle and of course the secret garden. It's one of my favorite childhood movies. I'm getting nostalgic just looking at the poster. I watched it over and over again as a child and I loved it! I just can't judge it with fresh and objective eyes but for what it's worth I think you should give it a try! It's a good movie for the entire family. Even though it's almost 30 years old, I still think you can really enjoy it. It's one of those movies that can last forever (like The Princess Bride). It magical and moving and definitely worth a watch!",The Secret Garden
23,socrates99,It's shocking to have found this film by chance,9,25 August 2016,"We used to attend Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival. If this film was shown there, we missed it. Clearly it should have been there. This is the most overlooked great film I've seen in a long time.I never read the original novel, and I'm sure that would make a difference, but as a newbie to this children's story I was surprised how strongly I was moved by it. There's something about an unloved child that tugs at the heart strings and the lead here, Kate Maberly, is near perfect as Mary Lennox, the child heroine who manages to bring life to a home that's been robbed of it despite having greatly suffered herself.The cast is basically three wonderful child actors and Maggie Smith and this film needed someone as strong as her to counter the children's powerful performances. This may be the best family movie (I generally dislike family movies) I've ever seen. There's no mawkish sappiness here.",The Secret Garden
24,macpherr,Good movie. I recommend it!,7,9 December 2000,"Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now) sometimes surprises me. I did now realize until this very moment that Francis produced this movie. The movie is based on a true classic story. There are so many symbols and different meanings that one can draw from this story that the best thing is to watch the movie or read the book to find out for yourself. I could draw so many life lesson that there is not enough space to mention them all here. I will just mention a few. The first premise that I can draw is that only love makes things grow. Those two kids ""Kolin"" and ""Mary"" were completely neglected by their parents and left to be raised by their nannies. They both were unruly and demanding of other people. To them everybody was there to serve them. On the hand ""Dickon"" Andrew Knott (Black Beauty), my favorite character in the movie, had already found happiness  where it really resides, in the simple things such as: the bird singing, the beauty of the flowers that seem neglected and dead during the winter which will blossom again in the Spring.
Another premise is never pass to your child the sour things that life has given you. Kolin's father's grief for his wife's death grew in such a way that it completely voided his relationship with his son. The kid never went outside, it is amazing!!!  When he finally felt light in his eyes, he could not stand it, this meant that he lived in complete darkness. Everybody thought that he had some type of physical impairment, it is true to reality that the psychological will make one physically impaired. There are more lessons but I will move on. Favorite Quotes: Kolin: ""I am going to die!""  Mary: ""Of what!""  Kolin: ""Everything!"" Kolin: ""Hair, hair is dead!""  Mary: ""If it is dead how come it keeps on growing even after you die?""Favorite Scenes: Father finally meeting his son. Good movie. I recommend it!",The Secret Garden
25,Dawalk-1,An Enchanted Garden Like You've Never Seen.,10,21 April 2016,"I've known about this movie version since its release. And I never read the book (probably didn't even know that it was even based on a book at the time). For years, I initially had no interest in seeing it. That is, until I first came across the animated version of this that aired as part of the ABC Weekend Specials and I was curious enough to check out (which I did on Youtube) and enjoyed it. A few months later and earlier this year, I decided to search for and watch this live action version on Putlocker and enjoyed it just as much. This is another one I've since added to the ""What have I been missing?"" list. I guess somehow I not only underrated this, but underestimated it as well. I consider this to be among the best or greatest family films of all time. For several years, I didn't know there were any other live action adaptations of the book and I wouldn't discover them until I came across them online. I haven't seen Hallmark's T.V. movie rendition nor the first live action one from 1949, but I'd like to see those too, though I want to see Hallmark's first, once I'm finally able to find it and stream online. From what I've read about it, this may be truer to its source and maybe even the truest out of all these film/T.V. remakes, but I'm partial to this and the ABC Weekend Special.Without much further ado, onto the points I'm making about this. It is absolutely fantastic, spectacular. Following her parents' deaths, a girl named Mary Lennox is sent away from India to England to live with her uncle and his son in a mansion. But little does Mary know after she arrives there, she's about to be in for a surprise: A different kind of garden that isn't run-of- the-mill, a garden she's never seen before, a garden that's full of magic and marvel. The titular place that is the central focus of the story, it has the special powers of healing and rejuvenation. The role it plays involves some other things, but I don't want to give away too much more. I can see why the story is among the most beloved of all time. It has some nice, tender, mostly wholesome moments, then of course, there's the enchantment of the garden. It may be one of the most creative tales ever written. To everyone who hasn't already seen this, don't sleep on it like I did. I wish I had checked it out sooner. Everything about it is well done, from the writing to the acting to the cinematography to the music. It's just great all around. To find out more about it, y'all have got to see for yourselves. One of those movies that is a must- see and a must-not-miss, I love it and I've had a newfound appreciation for it since.",The Secret Garden

Here she finds an almost dead house, that she manages to bring to life with her personality.It is a great story about magic, miracles, love.

27,SteveSkafte,The year that I solved the mystery of night,10,7 July 2011,"Somehow, what you grew up with seems more ancient than many similar things much older. I was seven years old when I first watched ""The Secret Garden"". Everything seemed more real then, the beauty, the yearning, the fear. But unlike many films that have faded into memory over time, this is one that has grown stronger and more real to me.The character of Mary Lennox (played by Kate Maberly) doesn't begin as the most friendly of people. She is a product of her environment, a bratty, demanding girl who can't imagine anything much beyond getting her way. But don't let that get in the way of identifying with her. Her journey throughout ""The Secret Garden"" is one of great inner discovery. It's the wondrous power of adventure that brings her out of herself, the understanding that no one will look out for her. Much like the character of Tyler in ""Never Cry Wolf"" she has a lot to learn about the power of solitude. It makes me wonder how many people in this world could gain something from time spent alone.""The Secret Garden"" taught me about the sense of wonder. As the story progresses, things feel more and more magical. Zbigniew Preisnerhas composed a soundtrack that feels like leaves blowing, raindrops falling. He fills the garden itself with a world of beauty, a powerful field of growing music. There is a key scene of time lapse images when the Spring flowers first make their way out of the ground. I love this film with all my heart, from the power of silence to the strength of images (by cinematographer Roger Deakins). Some films are beautiful because they're so real. ""The Secret Garden"" is real, yes, but it's magic. Pure magic.",The Secret Garden

Like the fits and tantrums that Collin throws at times it was just too much. And many times there were too much screaming form everybody. Although Maggie smith and Luara Crosley's performances were good and the only reason I give this a. 4 and not a 2 out of ten. Ther garden looked beautiful the key is found in some place and that was it the rest was awful. The best version for me is the one that came out in 1947.

It is a film for all ages, and sure to be enjoyed by all of them, too.  A vivid and affecting film, it's got many things going for it: mesmerizing cinemetography and time-lapse photography, a good music score and script, breathtaking sets, wonderful direction, great acting, even gorgeous flowers!  Agneiska Holland does a great job at bringing out all the subtle little points and details in the story and great performances from her young cast, particularly from Kate Maberly as Mary.  Heydon Prowse is good, too, as Colin, and so is Maggie Smith as Mrs. Medlock, the frusterated, overprotective housekeeper who seems to be mean, but really is only doing what she thinks best.  One of the few films I've seen that I can call perfect with conviction; definitely should be seen and appreciated.",The Secret Garden
30,danjakubik,"A truly beautiful, charming and heartwarming film for children and adults!",10,26 May 2008,"Possibly the most charming and heartwarming film I have ever seen! I never read the classic children's novel it's based on by English author Frances Hodges Burnett, however this film quickly had me absorbed from the first time I viewed it theatrically when it was first released in 1993. The photography and musical score are excellent, adding much mood and emotion to the story.The story concerns a 10 year old English girl named Mary, living in India with her neglectful parents. Her parents are killed in an earthquake and she moves to her uncle's manor in the English countryside. When Mary first arrives at her new home, she is an angry, sour and defiant child. This large and gloomy manor does not seem to hold any promise as a happy place to live, however, there are surprises in store, that change Mary for the better.From direction, to casting, to acting, to film editing, to photography and music score, this film is just about perfect. Even upon later viewings, I find myself smiling and crying throughout this film. This is partly due to my fondness for children and animals to be sure. The mood and feeling of this film really captures a child's perspective convincingly. ""The Secret Garden"" published in 1911, is one of author Burnett's later works in life and is her most enduring novel.Another famous and popular Burnett novel ""Sarah Crewe"" was made into a play ""A Little Princess"" and a theatrical film of the same name released in 1995. ""A Little Princess"" of 1995, is an excellent film also and certainly ranks as a major favorite film to me. Comparisons between the two films are inevitable not only because of being based on novels by the same author but their proximity in time when released (2 years). ""A Little Princess"" 1995, may have more dazzling photography and production design than ""A Secret Garden"" 1993, from a solely artistic film making viewpoint, but ""A Secret Garden"" is a wiser story, that even exceeds the charm and heartwarming feeling of the ""A Little Princess"" 1995.",The Secret Garden
31,fatcat-73450,At the Tail End of the Victorian Era but Still Seeped in It,5,24 October 2021,"This movie is apparently based on a book by Frances Hodgson Burnett which was written in the Victorian Era.You can tell it is a product of both. At first I thought it was a knock-off of The Little Princess. Then I looked it up and found that Burnett also wrote Little Princess. Can a writer rip off his own work?In Princess, the main character is a girl with an overflowing imagination who spent her childhood in India and then goes back to the industrialized world and there becomes an orphan. The main villain? A sensitive and extremely strict middle-aged spinster. The plot? Rigid Victorian society, embodied by the antagonist, tries to suppress the girl's freedom and imagination. She doesn't contain herself, though, and works as a bad influence on other children, inspiring them to think outside the box of their Victorian gilded cages and find the whimsy of India (or just an imaginary world? As India as such is barely mentioned except superficially) in their mundane lives.Secret Garden is all of this except that this time the girl was already an orphan before the movie begins. It sounds insignificant, but it actually made Princess a far more interesting movie since we're able to compare how the protagonist acts in wealth with how she acts in servile poverty. In Garden, Mary Lennox is a little racist and spoiled at the beginning of the movie and that's all we see of that.Otherwise it's a bag of garden variety Victorian tropes. Spinsters are rigid and angry, rich kids are sickly and spoiled, the poor are polite, humble, and good, a benevolent rich guy comes to save the day. If you've read Jane Eyre, if you've seen Heidi, or if you're familiar with the works of Charles Dickens, you know what's up.Not much character development, a bunch of one-dimensional characters, and the things that happen aren't too firmly mored to the dock of reality. Nevertheless, the costumes are good and it works. You get your hour and a half of escape into a Victorian fairy tale where the worst thing that can happen is that you get sent to bed without your porridge and imagination and hope bring rich father figure home to set everything right.Honourable Mentions: A Little Princess (1995). A far better movie dealing with the same subject matter. Also the use of the red balloon as a symbol is far more tasteful than the red sweater in Schindler's List (1993). Spielberg did it first, though, so I think the director took a page from his book.",The Secret Garden
32,crash21,"Not quite the book, but still very good",8,26 February 2017,"This is one of the few stories that you can have someone give you, and be both entertained and even have feelings for the characters. For instance, Mary lives in a rich family, yet she almost would like her way out of of it. A lot of this is what gives her the feelings for the outside life and the garden when she finds it, along with her making friends with people like Martha and her brother Dickon, along with her spoiled and supposed sick cousin Colin.I love the ending to this story when Mary's uncle finds the kids (specifically his son) playing in the garden, and the orphan cousin Mary runs off crying that no one wants her. It's a feeling everyone feels at some time in their life. Then her uncle says that she had brought the family back to life, and tells her that the garden is hers. The moment will bring tears to your eyes. After this, where she says ""if you look closely, you will realize the whole world is a garden"" which is very true, even when you include what we have done to hurt the world. The closing scene in the movie where they show the shadow effects over the grass hills makes me think of what you can truly see in simply an open field, or even trees with an open sky and clouds passing overhead. The whole movie is touching and beautiful.The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that there were a couple moments you can tell weren't what the story to the original book had told, other than that, ""The Secret Garden"", both the book and the movie are touching entertainment for the whole family.",The Secret Garden

I have it on video, and watch it whenever I need cheering up. It is one of those rare films that I can really say is flawless. The cast are superb. The three children particulerly standing out. The scenery is breathtaking, and the score beautiful. It makes you feel that wonderful things can happen in life, and that you can make them happen. In a time when more and more films are relying on special effects rather then a good script and a decent storyline, this is one that film makers everywhere should take note of.

This movie is virtually perfect in almost every way, and I doubt if it will soon be displaced as the definitive version. One aspect of this film which I loved was Andrew Knott as Dickon, who ultimately sublimated his love for Mary to help Colin in the grand tradition of the English Hero - the common man. As in the Lord of the Rings, it is not a Jedi Knight, or a superman or muscleman or gun-slinging cowboy who is the hero, it is one of the common folks who rises to the occasion when greatness is demanded by the times and situation. As did Sam Gamgee, the Hero of the LOTR, so does Dickon stand out as an almost mythical personification of love and sacrifice for the good of others with no thought of recompense. This is what I love about classic English novels, how the average guy can change the world, if he loves it enough. Wonderful stuff.",The Secret Garden
35,keith-moyes,Raised from the dead,9,14 December 2008,"I recently came across an old video of this movie that I had packed away years ago. I decided to give it a view to see what condition it was in. I am glad I did. Although the video had deteriorated slightly it was still highly watchable, but this is clearly a movie that I need to upgrade to DVD.The Secret Garden is a little gem. It confirms something that one of my friends has been saying ever since he became a father and started watching movies with his daughter: most of the best pictures being made these days are children's films. Few adult movies are as well crafted as this.The book seems to have been an obsession with the BBC. I first saw it in 1960, but by then there had already been two earlier versions (1949 and 1952) with further adaptations to follow in 1975 and 1987.As an eleven-year-old boy, I was embarrassed to be watching such a 'girly' programme and would have been humiliated if anybody had found out how enthralled I was, but by the time this movie came out I could watch it without any reservations.I immediately fell in love with Kate Maberly's Mary Lennox and my heart bled for the neglect and emotional privation that had created this sullen, imperious little madam. Maberly has had a successful career ever since and would probably be crestfallen to know that there are people like me who will always associate her with a performance she gave when she was still only ten. However, other performances are as good: for example, Laura Crossley's scene-stealing Martha. And when has Maggie Smith ever been less than outstanding?The direction by Agnieszka Holland is spot on. I have just checked her credits and found that she was responsible for another overlooked movie that made an impression on me when I stumbled across it recently: Copying Beethoven.It is beautifully shot, with some magical time-lapse photography, and has a great score.The screen play by Caroline Thompson is masterful. Again, I checked her credits and found she wrote three pictures for Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare before Christmas and The Corpse Bride: 'nuff said.When I was eleven, the idea of a couple of kids tinkering about in a garden seemed rather soppy and was the principal cause of my unease, but of course I was missing the almost pagan symbolism of the garden, whose regeneration parallels the regeneration of Mary and Colin. Thompson puts this symbolism right at the heart of the story and underlines it with a beautiful scene in which Colin's impromptu fire ceremony summons his father back from the south of France. This is turn-of-the-century magical realism.Giving Mary a voice-over was also a good decision. It keeps the movie focused and allows Thompson to take us efficiently through the plot without any sense of being hurried along. However, I cannot help noting that the serialisations were often twice as long and this leaves me with a slight feeling of regret.Although this movie doesn't need to be any longer than its current 97 minutes, I would still have liked it to be a bit more expansive. There are a few areas where some follow through would have helped. For example, Colin's spasm of jealousy when he sees Mary on the swing with Dicken leads to nothing. This (and similar examples) are only minor quibbles that do not really impact on the effectiveness of the movie. The truth is that I simply want to spend more time with these entrancing characters. I wonder if there were any deleted scenes that would allow for an extended cut.My rediscovery of this timeless little classic will now send me out in search of the other Hodgson Burnett movie that came out shortly after this one: The Little Princess.IMDb reviews suggest I have another treat in store for me.",The Secret Garden

I would especially praise Maggie Smith for her robust performance. The part of the leading lady was also remarkably well-performed. Without revealing parts of the story, I will just say that it's about each person having the key to his open betterment and that we should follow our own mind and instincts instead of paying attention to people that want to lock us on prisons (with golden bars or not).",The Secret Garden

I've watched it loads of times and I honestly never get bored of it. It's such a beautiful film that it has me crying at the end of it every time I watch it. It has the line ""You brought us back to life, Mary. You did something I thought no one could do."" which just gets me welling up. Its the one film I can't bring myself to fault. Yes its dated and possibly some errors but it's wonderful. The scenery is beautiful. the story is heartwarming, the acting is brilliant (it's got Maggie Smith in for God's sake!), the characters are different and it just one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy.

The movie is perfectly done so much so it's like you get the best version of the vision laid right out in front of you.

40,DomiMMHS,Perfectly done!,9,22 May 1999,"OK, I love the film! Kate Maberly is such a wonderful young actress and I would like to see more of her! When I saw the movie for the first time I was 14 and I was really astonished how she could make me identify with Mary Lennox, a 10-year-old girl from the beginning at the century, in a story line no one would give a damn about in our days. It has been an experience of its own since. Now I'm 18 and probably more cynical, so it has lost some of its magic to me, but I still like to try to get enchanted and I would urge everyone to ... well ... open his mind. It's a children's movie alright, but more important it is just perfectly done!Mrs. Medlock, Mary Lennox's adversary, if you want so, is played by the excellent Maggie Smith. She rules the castle of Mary's tragic uncle, where she has to live. As if the castle weren't already a very eerie and uncomfortable place (you feel it), under her orders it becomes some kind of nuthouse as she's jerking around everybody - giving the movie very funny and very weird moments. It's unfair how she treats Mary and just plain crazy what she does to Colin, Mary's cousin. But she's not really evil, not a villainess, but she'll show us that she has a heart. I appreciate this attitude very much: how people are never really evil, only a bit sickened.All characters and actors are really fine, but I want to lose a few more words about Mary Lennox. It's an extremely well-written character for a child and this allows Kate Maberly to carry the movie, make us want to accompany her. Originally, she actually is *egotistic*, but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right. You'll find her cheeky, you'll like her and you'll understand her.There is much more to say about the picturesque garden, music, friendships, attitudes and so forth... I'll leave it with my above feelings and thoughts. (If you know the movie, you'd find that I'm ignoring pretty much)Because I'm *cynical*, it doesn't make the 10: so 9 out of 10, then!",The Secret Garden
41,jcorelis-24336,A good version of a sentimental favorite,7,27 April 2017,"A young child is sent from a far country to live with a relative in a gloomy old aristocratic pile. But there are dark mysteries concerning both the estate and the relative. In the course of solving them, the child brings a new understanding to both herself and her relative.From this outline of the story of The Secret Garden, it should be clear how similar it is to the better known book and film Little Lord Fauntleroy. Both are based on the immensely popular 19th century young people's books by British-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett, and both have been the subject of numerous theatrical, film, and television versions. Of the half dozen or so film/TV treatments, many feel that this 1949 version with Margaret O'Brien, Herbert Marshall, Dean Stockwell, and Elsa Lanchester is the best. The acting is very good to excellent, and the atmosphere of the old house with its ruined garden effectively conveyed. The screenplay is co-authored by Robert Ardrey, who later became well known as a popular science author for such works as African Genesis. An interesting feature of the film from a cinematic viewpoint is the sudden switch from black and white to color (as was done famously in The Wizard of Oz) to highlight the happier scenes.Though the film, like the book, is ostensibly for young people, it's one that can equally be enjoyed by adults. Of course it's sentimental, but this is the type of film where the sentimentality is the whole point: viewers who dislike sentimentality shouldn't be watching it.",The Secret Garden
42,gkearns,A messiah who learned how to cry,10,15 December 2001,"(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)Ninety years ago Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote the classic book of childhood, ""The Secret Garden,"" unleashing into the world of literature one of the most remarkable characters ever, Mary Lennox. Mary is a plain-looking ten year old child who was raised in India. She was all but completely ignored by her self-absorbed parents and put under the care of ayahs, who indulged her in order to keep her from bothering her parents. She had no friends or playmates of her age, so she never experienced the give and take of interacting with other children. Thus, she grew to the age of ten generally helpless, unable to care for herself, demanding, and lacking in basic social skills. Contrary to some critical opinions, Mary isn't so much nasty-bratty as haughty-arrogant. But she had a seemingly insatiable thirst for learning, and the capacity and wisdom to read and understand the ways of her world. And she had a driving will to achieve her goals. She also was able to recognize and appreciate offers of friendship and love from whatever source. (SPOILERS)Considering the depth and power given her character by author Burnett in the first half of the story of ""The Secret Garden,"" it's ironic that with the introduction of Colin Craven, her cousin, Mary seems to be elbowed out of the way in favor of a bigger emphasis on Colin's story line. Indeed, in the original story and most of its movie incarnations, she isn't even given the privilege of sharing in the dramatic ending where Colin and his estranged father are at last united. It's especially ironic in light of the fact that it was through Mary's efforts that the garden and its magic were resurrected, Colin grew strong, and the reconciliation of Colin and his father was enabled. ""The Secret Garden"" is not Mary's story; however, it's the story Mary made possible. (SPOILER)Director Agnieszka Holland, a devoted admirer of the original novel, understood Mary's importance, and brought the story around in a full circle to end in the scene where Lord Craven, Colin's father, gives Mary her deserved recognition. ""You brought us back to life, Mary,"" he tells her. So this movie starts with an arrogant child throwing her name at you, not caring whether you like her or not, and it ends with a messiah who ""learned how to cry.""The whole cast was great, especially the children Heydon Prowse (Colin) and Andrew Knott (Dickon) and especially, especially Kate Maberly who played Mary with such power and depth. Also, recognition should go to Maggie Smith as the intimidating Mrs. Medlock, John Lynch as Colin's somber bereft father Lord Craven, and to Laura Crossley for her heart-warming portrayal of the bright, sensitive, humble Martha.",The Secret Garden
43,critical-escapist,You know that boring adaptation of your favorite children's book? Bingo.,9,23 April 2006,"The 1993 version of The Secret Garden is probably always hailed as the best version of the classic children's novel. The thing I loved about Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic was that it was her only book that she didn't write about a perfect little kid who had to struggle  The Secret Garden is about a imperfect, bratty little kid who had to struggle. But hey, I loved the book so that brings high expectations to the film  and I was disappointed.For those illiterate people (I'm kidding) who do not know the story, the story beings with Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly), a spoiled little brat who lived in India with god-knows-how-many-servants who take care of her. Her parents do not care for her and instead they go to parties and enjoy themselves. One day a horrible earthquake hit India and many died, including Mary's parents.Mary is sent to live with her uncle (John Lynch), a heartbroken widow. The house is like a mansion, watched closely by Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith). While Mary goes searching around, she finds a ""secret"" garden, a garden that her uncle has locked up many years ago after his wives' death. Mary meets Dickon (Andrew Knott), the brother of one of the servants, Martha (Laura Crossley) who happen to talk with animals and helps Mary with the garden. Mary also meets her cousin Colin the son of her uncle who is isolated and alone, fearing death may come (like a smaller 1900s version of Woody Allen's character in Hannah and her Sisters).A huge problem of the film is that I find it impossible your average ten year old would enjoy the film. The film is slow and has a lot of moments where cute little kids run through corridors. The ending seems abrupt and kind of phony. Sometimes the dialogue even sound fake or just what adults think children would say to each other. In the book (excuse me for comparing film to book), Mary seems to really develop, while in the film, she just suddenly becomes a little angel. There are even moments in the book that Mary still seem a little bratty and probably haven't fully changed and in here, she just magically changes in the instant that she steps into the garden. Dickon, which I thought wasn't as likable in the movie as in the book (especially when he seems like he is harassing Mary in some scenes)  I enjoyed book Dickon a lot better.Directed by Agnieszka Holland, it visually looks stunning but the screenplay written by Caroline Thompson disappoints me because it lacked the book's heroic spirit. There are some scenes that seemed so sudden, like a coincidence. There are a few likable moments in the film where you just smile and mentally wink at the screen, but nothing more. Overall, the film seemed like a drag, seeming longer than it really is. The acting is not superb and sometimes even over-the-top. Maggie Smith is actually quite good here, showing that she hasn't really aged since (watch the Harry Potter movies).",The Secret Garden

Colin is dying, his mother died, Mary's parents die...yeah. For what it is, it's great. The acting is superb, the plot is engaging, and the Secret Gardner itself is astounding. The movie is full of secrets, and characters with secrets. Pretty much all the main characters have had some sort of tragedy in their lives.It's one of those movies that you want to watch again. It's not exceptionally funny, although there are dashes of humor. Not that romance, but there is some. And no violence at all, save for maybe a few scenes. So overall...the target audience will enjoy it, and older members will enjoy it too. Odds are that anyone over age 10 will find this movie very likable.",The Secret Garden
47,CuratingAesthetics,"Movie, Movie Quite A Story. How I Do Love You So!",9,30 October 2017,"Secret Garden is one of my all-time favorite films. I love everything about it. Starting with the music, this is also one of my favorite soundtracks, which I listen to regularly. It is emotional and incorporates beautiful instrumentals with strings, flutes and pianos. During the more high tense scenes the music gets louder and shrill, and the pace quickens with the flow of the characters. The pitch is low and dreary. Then when it's calm and slow the music smooths and becomes a relaxing melody, sometimes accompanied with quiet singing.The color scheme increases the mood by being very washed out and dark for most of the film. There are a lot of muted colors mixed with blacks and dark grays. It gets gradually more colorful as the film progresses and the garden begins to grow. The lighting gets brighter, more colors are introduced in the backgrounds and sets, and even Mary's clothes go from blacks to yellows and whites. The changes along the way are subtle, but by the end of the film the contrast is polar opposite to how it started. The garden goes from dead to being full of lush foliage and flowers. The significance is mirrored in the family when they go from three lonely people with bad dispositions and blossom into a loving and happy family.The movie isn't a fantasy film, but it does evoke a feeling of magic. The children's imaginations and the wonder they feel by sharing this secret garden allows for a ""what if"" aspect to the story. Even when they are doing the experiment to bring Lord Craven home it doesn't feel like much of a stretch for them to believe that what they are doing is real. There are some really beautiful time lapse videos of the plant growth that add to the enchantment of the movie. With roots and leaves sprouting in an instant, transforming the landscape into something unrecognizable. The actors are all great. Of course there is the always lovely Maggie Smith, who here played a rather nasty and pretentious woman. You couldn't help but hate her a bit. The performances by Kate Maberly as Mary and Heydon Prowse as Colin were impressive, particularly when you consider they were only around ten years old when this was filmed. Their characters were full of fervor and forcefulness at first, and then softened by the end of the film into almost entirely different people.This is a wonderful coming of age film that I think is great for all ages. I would recommend the book, as well. There of course are parts from it that didn't make it to the film. It really is a lovely story and a wonderful film.",The Secret Garden

I am wondering why I don't see her in many other films. Maggie Smith who was also in the film, of course brings a dramatic performance.  I wasn't expecting anything less from her.I really enjoyed the film and everyone should at least see it once.I don't know how they did it, but the film has alot of drama, however, it doesn't get too mushy.

I later saw the 1987 TV version which I really enjoyed also but when the 1993 version came out with a Mary that played a believable spoiled rich British girl I came to love that version best. 
This is the story of an orphaned girl who has never known much love from her selfish parents.  When they die, she is moved from India to live with her rich uncle in a great and mysterious great house in Yorkshire.  There she learns of a great mystery surrounding the death of her mother's twin sister and the grief of her uncle that seems to have some connection to an abandoned and shut-up garden and her all but ignored cousin.

51,Chessack,An utter delight,10,7 July 2001,"This movie is an utter delight to watch. I have probably seen it a dozen times, and I never get tired of it. Everything about it is perfect: it's well-directed, well-acted, beautifully filmed, has great music, and the script and story are wonderful.Agneiszka Holland does an outstanding job directing this film. Each character is separate and unique; each one has little personality quirks that makes it seem real. Just about every scene in the movie includes children, animals, or both -- which must have been a nightmare to coordinate. Ms. Holland pulls it off without a hitch. Everything melds perfectly, and we are transported to a distant place and time, and fall in love with real, human characters. The primary three characters in this story -- Mary Lennox, Colin Craven, and Dickon -- are all children, played by actors who are around 10 years old. Ordinarily having one child in a movie is difficult enough, but again, somehow they pull it off. All three kids -- especially Kate Maberly -- do a fine job of acting, and they are quite credible. Kate is simply divine as Mary Lennox, and Heydon Prowse was a good counter-point to her as Colin.The story is touching and charming, and I think you'd have to be almost inhuman not to have a tear in your eye by the end of it. I absolutely fell in love with these children, and came to care very much about their characters. The ""secret garden"" really does seem to be a magical place (and I will say no more about it, since otherwise that would spoil things), and at the end I found myself wishing I could go and visit it first-hand. The accompanying music is wonderful -- I find myself humming it for days and days after watching it.In short, everything comes together to make this film a masterpiece. It is easily one of the 10 or 12 best movies ever made, perhaps *the* best movie ever made. I love it so much that I went out and bought the DVD of it, even though I'd seen it 8 or 10 times already. If you have not seen it I give it my highest possible recommendation. My score: 10/10.",The Secret Garden

Kate Maberly is perfect as the cold, sour little Mary who blossoms inside just like her garden, and there is more fine youthful casting in Heydon Prowse as the spoiled, fragile Colin, Andrew Knott as the gentle-natured Dickon, and Laura Crossley as sweet, talkative Martha. Maggie Smith is fantastic as usual as the stern Mrs. Medlock, and John Lynch gives a haunting performance as the nerve-shattered Lord Craven.It is rare to find family entertainment that is clean, well-scripted, and visually stunning, but this movie fits the bill perfectly.

It is a work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery, and watching it is like entering for a time into a closed world where one's destiny may be discovered.The movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden. The film retains the gothic atmosphere of the book and looks amazing, thanks to Roger Deakins's scintillating photography. Any kids' movie that aims for something richer than the Saturday-matinee escapism of smiling whales and preschool ninjas -- that actually captures some of the mystery of childhood -- ought to be embraced. whatever its peculiarities.By the end of the film I was surprised by how much I was moved; how much I had come to care about the lonely little boy, the orphaned girl, and the garden that a dead woman had prepared for them.The result is an instant classic -- rich, dense, resonant, powerful.",The Secret Garden

I had never read the book by Frances Hodgsen Burnett, but as a garden-lover, I had expected to enjoy it.The things that bothered me the most, however, were not the tedious story, but the anti-authority theme in the movie. I was surprised at the rudeness that Mary began with, and continued to use in her attitude towards adults in the household. She and Colin were rude to Mrs. Medlock and other adults who served them. And the magic scene, in which the children used a circling, chanting ceremony to ""summon"" Colin's father back, had a really sinister tone. There was a definite defiance in the way the children used this ""magic,"" in which there is nothing of the sort in the original book.When I read the book, which is an important and wonderful story, I realized my misgivings about this movie version were correct. The book was about children growing up healthy, unspoiled, well-loved, and full of faith. In this movie, the lessons of the book ""The Secret Garden"" are subtly twisted and manipulated into an angry, rebellious message that is a very different sort of story.",The Secret Garden

Not to sound like a pedophile, but the little girl played by Kate Maberly is just so cute. I think this would be the standard reaction of most people.

I read the book many years ago, and always thought it would make a great film. I later found out that it HAD been adapted, of course, several times. It is a classic children's novel, after all. But this seems to be the definitive film version. Firstly, let me say, straight off that this movie is beautifully shot. Bravo Mr. Roger Deakins, one of the world's best cinematographers. In too many reviews I've read, the cinematography is mentioned almost as an afterthought. From hot, dusty India to cold, grey England, this film looks wonderful. The three young leads are nothing special, it has to be said. But they are likable, or at least (in the case of Mary and Colin) become likable as the story progresses. And Maggie Smith - does this woman ever age? To be fair, she is the only actress I recognised. Chirpy young Martha and grizzled old Ben Weatherstaff are just how I pictured them, although their strong Yorkshire accents have been considerably softened. I won't spoil the ending for the very few people who don't know it, but suffice to say it is genuinely moving and made me smile. I've watched this film three times since I bought it last year, which for me is pretty good.

61,kingtrio9,Has the rare quality of understanding and enhancing its source,9,16 January 2006,"The Secret Garden is a rare treat where in the screenwriter and director actually understand their source, The Secret Garden by Frances Hogsden Burnett, and make a translation to the screen that not only captures the essence of the book but enhances the story as well. Too often directors spoil the story with their own self-interested spin (Little Big Man and Chocolat come immediately to mind)but here is a jewel that leaves the viewer saying ""That was as good as the book."" A genuine triumph.The cast is outstanding, the children in particular, Kate Maberly as Mary Lennox above all. Even to the most minor extra everyone brings a smooth and compelling reality to the story.However, the real star is director Agnieszka Holland. Against a challenging climate ( a rainy location) she manages to create a movie with a touching commentary on how children can literally change the world. Her insightful grasp of the themes of isolation, growth and rejuvenation, the need for a balance between nurture and allowable risk are all managed through the controlling metaphor of a garden. The artful rendering of these literary themes are what many directors apparently find most challenging ( I'm looking at you Arthur Penn)and generally blissfully ignore them compensating by glib insertions, extra action or clumsy sentiment. Not so here.Not only is her focus exemplary but the photography is amazing. The interplay of light and dark, the time elapse photos of clouds rolling and flowers emerging all set to beautiful music captivate the viewer. The rainy weather was not shunned but used to fullest effect. I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait. Fortunately all are up to the task and the film, the final scene in particular, results in a brilliant piece of motion picture art.The 1993 version of The Secret Garden is a must for every family film collection, one the parents and kids can enjoy for its sophistication or simply for the great way in which this timeless classic is retold.",The Secret Garden

I remember the day my mom bought the movie for me when it came out on VHS and I just couldn't stop watching it! Still to this day I still can't stop watching it! The Secret Garden is the most beautiful movie ever made-in every aspect. It's one of ""me and my mommy's favorite movies""!. This movie is so great, it even has it's own copy-cat movie(*Cough* LITTLE PRINCESS *cough!*...don't get me wrong, I do like the movie though).This movie has the best 3 child actors I have EVER seen! I'm surprised they haven't become mega-movie actors by now; but atleast they do have one amazing movie that they can add to their resume`!I would give you a summary, but I'd ruin the whole story!! If you want me to, drop me an e-mail asking about The Secret Garden and I'll ruin it for you. Believe me, you'll wanna plan your own Garden.Since alot of people are adding it, I'll add mine as well... Favorite Part: When Mary, Collin and Dickon are in the garden together and Collin learns how to walk for the first time. Also when Collin comes face to face with his father for the first time!!This movie shouldn't stay a Secret! I give it a 10 out of 10",The Secret Garden
63,steer0pike,Good family movie,10,25 July 2002,"As a child I remember watching this movie when it first came out, and I still haven't gotten bored from watching it. This movie came out the way I imagined it while reading book, even the children. However, there were slight differences in the movie. The scenery was beautiful, especially the scenes in the garden, which were nicely shot. Unlike some movies, the children can really act and are very convincing. Maggie Smith did a good job as Mrs. Medlock, her character was acted out nicely, sometimes I hated her character, but sometimes I felt sympathy towards Medlock. A good movie to watch with the family, and children will find it entertaining.",The Secret Garden
64,SmilePretty13,My absolute favorite movie,10,22 April 2003,"The director was genius! I loved the music and the actors were so great! Kate Maberly really did a great job, as did Maggie Smith and Laura Crossly! I also noticed how Mary's dresses changed along with how she progressed with her attitude. They got brighter and prettier, than just ""Black, Black or Black"". I also really LOVED the music, Zbignew Preisner's music fit the movie SO well, and I LOVED IT!!! The movie had some scary parts in it, too! Like when she went at night to find Colin, the music and the camera-work and that scary blanket with the ugly boy on it covering Colin's room gave it an eerie kind of vibe. I love this movie!!!",The Secret Garden
65,pssmilly,A movie that warms your heart,10,27 January 2017,"This is one of my favorite movies for the message it passes. The environment takes you to a peaceful and joyful place while you learn how to be happy and let happiness grow in your own heart. I think the garden is a metaphor for happiness. While they take care of that garden and its flowers and plants and let it come alive, the happiness comes back to that mansion and it spreads to the people around. The uncle wasn't even home for his son who grew up sick and couldn't even see the sunlight. Both of them learn how to be happy and forgive and how to love and live life fully. Anyway, it's a movie that everybody should watch specially on those sad days. It warms your heart.",The Secret Garden

At first I thought I was only going to view the first 10 minutes then hit the bed, but I simply couldn't stop. The screenplay is so perfectly done that there is actually not a boring moment, not at all. And those excellent children and the surprisingly adorable Martha! I've always loved the original book and the Broadway musical of Secret Garden and now I love this enchanting film even more! The seventy minutes went without feeling any of them, I even forgot to check on my sleeping baby as I usually would! The beauty of it is breathtaking, the plot and pace is gripping and the whole film is quite beyond expectation! It's better than the other film 'The Little Princess' as The Secret Garden seems to suit grown ups better! I'd very much love to see a musical film made out of it someday!",The Secret Garden
67,NCoward,"Rich, Moving, Poignant, and Beautiful",10,28 December 1999,"When writing or directing a children's film, far too oftenpeople find it necessary to dumb down work in order to cater toa young audience. Fortunately this is not the case with TheSecret Garden, a film in which the story it presents is wellcrafted and intelligent, and appealing to both young and oldaudiences. In many ways the production could have gonedreadfully wrong. One can see where in the hands of a lesstalented writer or director the story could have becomemelodramatic, overly sentimental, or comical, yet The SecretGarden is a beautifully executed picture that rings true as aresult of its naturalistic storytelling. Much of this is due tothe credit of its fine cast. Frequently, child actors areemployed to act ""cute"" onscreen, but there is not a young actorin this movie who does not give a performance of great depth. Infact, it can easily be argued that each one of these childrenexhibit greater skill than many adults currently working in therealm of cinema. But what is at the heart of The Secret Gardenis a beautiful lyrical story about love, childhood, growth, andhealing. There are moments in the film that are so genuinelytouching the viewer's heart almost stops. Such is the case ofthe scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside ofhis house and his eyes open to see spread before him hismother's beautiful garden. No line of dialogue is necessary, forthe happiness and peace that appears on Collin's face speakvolumes in regard to his character. The film's ending emotion is so rich and moving that it isimpossible for the filmgoer to sit untouched. This story is anabsolute delight, and should be a must for",The Secret Garden
68,snapper-12,My Most Precious Movie Choice,10,27 August 2004,"Once in a while something excellent comes along that adds to one's life in unexpected ways. As a single father of two children, boy and girl, I look far and wide for movies that will allow me to provide good, wholesome family time...without the fear of foul language issuing forth, foul gestures, or all-too-typical South Central L.A. ghetto demeanor being exhibited by punkish personalities. And unfortunately too many Hollywood child actors are nowadays forced to lower their personal ethics for inappropriate movie roles in our never ending averaging-down of America.The Secret Garden dismisses the need to add token actors of every type (a.k.a. Disney's last unbelievable rendering of Annie - TV 1999), race and sexual dysfunction to it's cast. Movies once were special beautiful places where the best actors were chosen for the part, and where viewers could easily lose themselves and for a short time become something in their mind's eye that was wonderful and magical. This is such a film. It's cast is well chosen for the story, not for current day hypocrisy. The Secret Garden allows viewers to immerse in a world larger than themselves ease and without having to keep saying...now why is THAT person in the movie...or why does THAT person have to keep making obscene gestures or engage in a constant flow of obscene sexual double-entendres? This movie is pure of heart. It is one of one of Hollywood's finest creations. Kate Mayberly as Mary Lennox is convincing. Her entry into the film is as a 10 year old girl who is catered hand and foot, literally, bathed and dressed by Indian nannies, then ignored by her parents. She grew to feel pampered, unloved and unwanted, and without the training to even dress herself. This is a sobering cameo to any parent, of how not to 'raise' a child.The Secret Garden has been re-made many times, in books, in the theatre, in movies...and several reasons for the sudden death of Mary's parents are provided. The manner of their death is utterly unimportant, for it is the rest of the movie in which the magic of love and acceptance blossoms, and the viewer's anticipation grows as surely as does Mary's own heart and personal demeanor, and as a perfect reflection of the new growth of her formerly abandoned and neglected aunt's garden.Kate Mayberly is beautiful. She is an exceptionally talented young actress.My family has enjoyed shedding a few tears along with her character, Mary Lennox during the many times we've viewed The Secret Garden, and we have learned a bit more about the value of caring...and about the power of love.To anyone considering purchasing The Secret Garden as a family film, do it. There are no downsides here, no parts where a parent has to cover his child's eyes or ears. The Secret Garden is the perfect family film.",The Secret Garden
69,vega-37,This movie is fine but it has very little to do with the real story,6,12 April 2008,"The acting is very good, the scenery is lovely, the filming is well done, but where did this story come from? I have just read the book for the first time, and then directly after that watched this film version. What a disappointment! What a modernized mess! (not in the physical things but in the sensibilities) I could make a list of a hundred things they changed that didn't need to be changed. It's as if the filmmaker thought people couldn't understand the subtleties of the actual story and had to hit us over the head with it. Obnoxious!One example is that instead of the lovely magic that Colin works on his own health by telling himself over and over that he will get well, and by believing it and visualizing it, the magic is portrayed as a weird voodoo thing in the movie. This is the same problem with the Anne of Green Gables movies. This book was published at the same time, and the dreamy delicate sweetness of the book is gone in the movie version. It's as though the way of seeing the world in the early nineteen hundreds is impossible to bring to the screen, at least in children's movies. (I don't believe it is impossible, but the filmmakers seem to have believed that).",The Secret Garden

71,tabaquij,A dull take on a classic story.,2,17 February 2019,"The Secret Garden has long been a favorite book of mine, and I've read it a dozen times or more. Which is why this move was an utter disappointment. From the start, the voice-over narration is lifeless and pointless. The parents are killed in an earthquake - why change that? Plague not dramatic enough?Clumsy exposition from the characters is intrusive, and the story is hurried along, skipping over so many moments that actually make the changes Mary goes through make sense and seem real. It's more like a Lifetime tv movie than a big-screen adaptation, and the weird 'romance' triangle introduced between the children (and the weirder summoning dance) only detracts from what could have been something good. The overall look is dull, the pacing lifeless, and the children, sadly, charmless.Why do directors and producers feel the need to 'fix' or change stories that fans of those stories love as they are? When will someone actually do a version of The Secret Garden (or The Little Princess or Little Women) that's true to the story without additions, modernization, and a warping of the underlying tone and atmosphere?Very disappointing.",The Secret Garden

78,ozmy31,A hauntingly beautiful tale of personal discovery,10,28 March 2008,"The Secret Garden lies within the confines of Mislethwaite Manor - a remote, gloomy place just like its owner, Lord Craven who has retreated there from life's unkind onslaughts. The garden is walled off - abandoned, locked, hidden behind ivy - the physical counterpart to its unhappy owner. Only the robin knows what lies behind its walls. Into this lonely setting made ever more memorable by the film's haunting music, stunning photography, superb cast, and outstanding direction, steps Mary Lennox - a sour, spoilt little girl, orphaned in India where both her parents died. But at Mislethwaite, she begins to discover not only her gloomy physical surroundings; in doing so, she also learns to appreciate something about the others who live there - Martha, the little maid sent to help her; the fierce housekeeper, Mrs Meddlock; Dickon - the boy on the moors with his gift for communicating with animals; and Colin - the mysterious source of crying at night that everyone at least initially else dismisses as ""the wind blowing across the moors"" or another maid's toothache. Finally, Mary begins to discover little by little something much more valuable about herself and others through the transformations that begin to take place from the secret garden as well as from her relationships at Mislethwaite.This is very much a film about personal discovery and personal growth set against the bleak background of moorland, mists, and the gloomy interiors of Mislethwaite. The film strongly suggests that some form of magic intervenes to make possible the processes of discovery and ultimately, healing. And it is not only Mary who makes discoveries - so too do Colin and Lord Craven, and to a lesser extent, the others at Mislethwaite.The tantrums, outbursts of temper and sulking which all figure so prominently in the story might lead some to suppose that this is primarily a film for and about children. But the story is a sensitive exploration not only of childhood but also of human relationships on a general level. It functions as a sort of magic carpet that whisks us off to realms in which we might just possibly recognise fleeting glimpses of ourselves. As such, some might classify ""The Secret Garden"" along with ""The Railway Children"" (1970) - an elegy about personal discovery, development and healing within the more general contexts of a therapeutic environment and learning how to live with other people.",The Secret Garden

80,ktbear2,"Not the greatest adaptation, but not the worst",3,16 July 2010,"I remember seeing this in the movie theatre with my college roommate and my best friend. What irked me at the start was that they chose to kill people off in an earthquake and not with the Cholera. The earthquake seemed pretty cheesy to me then. (The tornado scene in The Wizard of Oz was more realistic.) The reason given by the director and screenwriter was that no one ""these days"" knows what Cholera is. Ironically, the week after the movie premiered, there was an earthquake in India and people were worried about Cholera breaking out. As a child reading this book cover to cover so many times that I wore out a copy, the fear of a fever and infectious disease that could get anyone was much scarier than the threat of an earthquake. The child playing Mary wasn't sour at all. She was cranky, and shrill. I never felt sorry for her. Dickon was an afterthought. He is what Mary wants to emulate. She even picks up on his Cockney speech (well, his and Ben Wetherstaff). They completely neglect the Martha/Mary/Mrs. Sowerby story. Here is a woman with more mouths than she can feed herself, and she takes Mary, the sour little yellow orphan into her heart and prayers. It is she who gets Archibald to the Manor upon her pleas that this motherless child need love and warmth. There was so much time spent on the cinematography, that true, joyous parts of this book were lost. When Mary calls Colin (That's COLIN, not KOLIN or COLLIN) a Rajah, he asks her to tell her what one is. That isn't in the book, but he behaves like a spoilt prince as they go outside. That's not the message in the book. In the book, he is a little more awkward and foolish about it. This Mary seems more annoyed at her cousin and his ""hump"" than defiant. Mary's defiance and determination in the book are what give Colin is gumption to get better. There is none of that in the book. It is a story of two spoiled only children who have to learn to live with someone else their age. There is also no mention of Colin taking pictures and getting jealous of Mary and Dickon in the book. It's an innocent story, why put a modern spin of heated tension between two kids? I do have to admit, seeing it again, that Sleezeball Gerry from Sliding Doors playing Uncle Archie was a bit of a treat. John Lynch is an underrated actor, and I hope to see him as a truly good guy someday. Dame Maggie was very good as the Icy Miss Metlock. I never liked the character, and I still don't. Well done. Someday, maybe before I pass on to my own garden, I will see a version that is truly faithful to the book, with great child actors (the 1949 version is hard to watch because even though the best child actors of the time are in it, they still seem wooden) who actually speak with British accents and a Mary who goes from crisp, Indian influenced British to Cockney. A version that gives us a Mrs. Sowerby and a scene in which Martha talks to her mother about the sour, little, girl. A Dickon who inspires Mary and Colin. While the book continues to run swells in my heart, no movie version of this book has done the same. Oh, and don't even get me started on the versions of ""A Little Princess"". All I can say is that putting a little African descended scullery maid (read slave) in Victorian England would make William Wilberforce (See the movie or read ""Amazing Grace"") turn in his grave. -K",The Secret Garden

For me it was such a wonderful and the perfectly the best film which was managed the film successfully and most succeeded by Polish Woman Director 'Agnieszka Holland'. No wonder if all generation has to like to watch this film especially a young-teenage people.I really love this movie at the same time after watching it! I have watched this film many times and then I didn't find anything boring about it from each part!The actors especially the 3 young kids- Kate Maberly as a Mary,Heydon Prowse as a Colin and also Andrew Knot as a Dickon were most talented and most outstanding for taking part in a role play from that film! They indeed put more an effort in a role play as a characters are given. It was such a pity because they haven't been so much participated in other films and Heydon Prowse as a Colin Craven,that was so terrible for me he doesn't act anymore, never seen him after this film started. However he made good decision for himself not to act next time or anymore! I have to accept this but not really..! No films have been played by Heydon Prowse. I like him the way he acted,was so amazing even the same as the other characters such as Mary Lennox,Dickon, Martha,and so on. Besides this film gave and understand us more about Love,Caring,truth Friendship,responsibility, support and assist when Mary Lennox totally changed Colin Craven to a normal finest person that we did not realize! Also one important thing is Secret can not be broken if someone doesn't tell to anyone else..that's the one point we should understood! Well,It's lovely and i do like this movie anyway!

The story highlights the troubles and constraints faced by Mary Lennox, Colin Craven, and Lord Craven and how the garden helps break those constraints and fix the emotional and physical issues going on with the characters. The meaning can be interpreted in various ways but the meaning that stood out to me was that a child's undying curiosity and eagerness for adventure can have such a significant impact.

Kate Maberly and Maggie Smith gave absolutely outstanding performances, they truly embodied their roles and it showed.

The film was directed by Caroline Thompson and based on the classic novel by Frances Hodgson Burnet beloved classic of 1911. The main character is Kate Maberly (Mary Lennox), who portrays a child with stubborn, feisty feelings and does an excellent job. She won two awards in 1994: they are the Special Achievement Award for her outstanding performance and the Young Artist Award for the best youth actress leading role in a motion picture drama. The film was well acted and made good ratings. It is reviewed as delightful, entertaining, moving, and will make you smile and put joy in your heart. It will be an unforgettable film and is delightful entertaining and moving. The story is about a spoiled ten year old girl named Mary Lennox (Kate Mayberly) who was born in a society family and lived in India. Her parents were selfish and wealthy partygoers who were too busy to spend time with her. She was raised by a servant who did everything for her. She hated India and the way her parent were. One day an earth quake hit and killed her parents and Mary Lennox (Kate Mayberly) was sent to England to live with her uncle Heydon Prowse (Colin Craven) in the countryside, Misselthwaite. It was a dreary castle that was closed off to the outside. She was introduced to a mean and dreadful and cold Mrs. Medlock who played the head servant. After she explored the castle, she met Colin Craven (Heydon Prowse) who was an invalid since birth and was pale and sickly, never leaving his bed. His mother died during childbirth from an accident in her garden, known as the secret garden. The cold lonely heart, Lord Craven (John Lynch) who was cursed and lived a dreary life was Collin's father. He only visited his son on occasions due to the pain he felt being reminded of his wife's death. Her friend was a farm boy Andrew Knott (Dickens) who showed love for animals and was seen with animals throughout each outdoor scene. He knew how to garden and helped bring life into the secret garden after ten years. The gardener Walter Sparrow (Ben Weatherstaff) allowed the children in the forbidden garden and was a kind gentle man. These characters and more created the storyline for the film and a sequence of events evolved. The sickly child learned to walk, the forbidden garden was restored and the orphan girl found a home. The scenery, characters and animals changed in the film from cold and dreary to loving and caring.

I loved it as a child and still find it absolutely amazing now. It has a wonderful cast. The young people in it are fantastic, performing better than I would ever have expected from people their age. The adults are also fantastic - especially Maggie Smith, she never disappoints me, and I think this is one of her best performances yet. The entire setting of the film is reflects the wonder and magic that have made the book by Frances Hodgson Burnett a classic. The images of the garden itself are absolutely stunning, it is almost worth watching the film just to see the beautiful landscape and architecture which is featured in it. If you want to escape the real world for a few hours I would definitely suggest this film. I just can not believe it wasn't the massive hit that it most definitely deserved to be!",The Secret Garden
93,Magee038,Lovely,10,24 November 2003,"It's the only word i can use to describe this movie.  Although I have seen this movie hundreds of times, I can not get past Andrew Knott's performance. I must admit being young the first time i saw the movie i had a huge crush on Dicken! I was just WAITING for him and mary to fall in love!  I am always disappointed at the end! Anyways, I just think that Andrew Knott's performance was outstanding, he did a great job in Black Beauty as well and I am surprised that he has not been extremely successful. I have it a 10!",The Secret Garden
94,sambarooni,For children and adults,10,14 July 2013,"I. Love. this. movie. This is my favorite production of the Secret Garden that I have seen. The acting is superb and the scenery and soundtrack are amazing. The music is haunting and beautiful, I honestly cannot praise it enough. This movie deviates from the book somewhat, but truthfully I think that I like the movie better. I really enjoyed Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary, she was the perfect combination of charming and sullen. In the book I found Mary very unlikeable throughout, but in this movie Kate was able to make her rude and spoiled (of course she would be with her upbringing)but also she made you have sympathy for Mary, and even like her as she grew as a character and became less irritating. Of course I love that Maggie Smith is in this (how can you not love her?) even if she is the ""bad guy"". Overall, this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I loved it as a child, and enjoy it as an adult. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.",The Secret Garden
95,hen3ry-1,The Perfect Film Found At Last!,10,9 January 2007,"Repeated viewings with various grandchildren, male & females (3-6), confirm my first impression: this is close to being a perfect film! Casting, direction, location, photography, wardrobe--on and on--all 10s. One of the great elements is the 'contrariness' of the lead girl, caused by her parents' neglect, which allows children to view a less than rosy child in a less than rosy childhood, as all are. The details of Victorian child & medical management are grim without being overwhelming. Maggie Smith's portrayal of a harried, prejudiced, socially obtuse woman who nevertheless struggles to do her duty, and who is then revealed to be a decent soul at the end--it's wonderful. She leads us to understand that villains can have complex motivations, some of them cultural, as with the vicious class system. Best of all, these elements are infused in the sub-text, just like reality, so no child can miss them. Magnificent!",The Secret Garden
96,badgirl_4you2004,An excellent Movie...,10,13 April 2005,"When I first saw this movie, I was deeply touched. Its an awesome movie that everyone of all ages should see. I could watch it over and over again and never get tired of seeing it. I like the music that was composed in this movie. The girl who played Mary Lennox is an extremely good actress. Its a movie that will make you laugh and cry and touch your heart at the same time. I really love this movie and the book as well. Both are very breathtaking. Its definitely a must-see kind of movie. Whoever hasn't seen this movie should definitely see it its worth it!! From the beginning to the end there was never a dull moment of this movie.",The Secret Garden
97,trudzz_41,Ben stars in Secret Garden,10,20 January 2005,"CLASSIC movie! Absolute gem! Great lovable characters, from the robust ""Jack the Lad"" Dickon, to the seedy old man Ben...and a sweet cameo by this bearded legend...whom looks like the wizard of Christchurch...a HUGGGGGEEEE recommendation, MUST see for all! As in ALL good movies, there is a spectacular chant scene which will have you on the edge of your seat. Did i mention the majestic Lord Craven...because he's awesome too. Put EVERYTHING on hold IMMEDIATELY, set your time machine to 1993, and go to your local cinema and see this GREAT flick! Keep BOTH ears open to the moving soundtrack, which you will be unable to resist buying a copy of the soundtrack for EVERY room in your house...leaving you weak in the knees! I cannot praise this movie enough as is it's credit due to it.",The Secret Garden

99,scooterpie-17461,Secret Garden Steals your Heart!,10,7 June 2017,"I am a seventh-grade teacher, and every year I use this film to teach basic film analysis. The students watch for lighting, camera angles, music, special effects, plot, costumes, and shots. Every year I think about using a different film, but the reaction I get from my students every year reassures me that this film is still relevant and a classic! They love it. I would highly recommend this film for children grades 4 - 7. Very suitable, and it has wonderful themes.",The Secret Garden
