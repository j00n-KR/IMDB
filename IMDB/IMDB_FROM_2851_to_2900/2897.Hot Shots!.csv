0,MartinHafer,"One of the best of the ""Airplane!"" style films.",8,7 October 2020,"With the success of ""Airplane!"" came many other similar style films. Some were by the same folks who made ""Airplane!"", such as ""Hot Shots!"", and many were by wannabes....who generally came up very short in bringing off such a rapid-fire comedy. While not quite as funny as ""Airplane!"", I think ""Hot Shots!"" is probably about as close as they got to recapturing the style and humor...along with ""Airplane! 2"".This film is a send off of ""Top Gun"". Through the course of the film, all sorts of crazy and silly stuff happens...but there really isn't much of a plot until the film is mostly over...and I can live with that! One joke after another after another...with most of them working....this is a very funny film...one I strongly recommend if you are feeling down and need a laugh.",Hot Shots!
1,SnoopyStyle,smirk worthy,5,2 August 2014,"It's parody of ""Top Gun"" from Jim Abrahams of ""Airplane!"" and ""Naked Gun"". Lt. Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) is the Maverick character who is struggling with his father's history. Lt. Kent Gregory (Cary Elwes) is the Iceman character. Ramada Thompson (Valeria Golino) is Topper's psychiatrist. Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach (Jon Cryer) suffers from walleye vision. Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson (William O'Leary) is ... well ... dead meat. Adm. Thomas Benson (Lloyd Bridges) is their clueless commanding officer. Lt. Cmdr. James Block (Kevin Dunn) is trying to create problems so that they get new planes with help from the manufacturer.This is a much more sillier movie. The jokes aren't all good. I actually liked the 'Elephant with 3 balls' joke because it plays on a couple of different levels. The jokes are cute but they don't really get a big laugh. It's generally smirk worthy. It's a decline in quality from earlier excellence.",Hot Shots!
2,Hitchcoc,Charlie Sheen Is the Perfect Choice,8,31 December 2016,"I get a kick out of these hit and miss comedy tributes to recent films. The more sight gags and ridiculous comments they can make, the more fun. I think the classic for this will always be the first ""Airplane"" movie. In this one, Charlie Sheen reprises Tom Cruise's character from ""Top Gun."" When the eggs started frying on that girl's body, I nearly fell off my chair. Not to mention that the plot itself and the mission involved are absolutely ridiculous. Except for the fact that they could not be anything else. The inimitable Charlie Sheen with his over-confidence and his somewhat bewildered look is the perfect choice for this. He has that handsomeness that works in this role. If you want to laugh out loud, take a chance.",Hot Shots!
3,kosmasp,Top Gun Shot(s),8,27 May 2021,"I should have rewatched Top Gun before seeing this ... I did hold back on that to make it a ""double feature"" when the second Top Gun movie finally gets its theatrical release .. you know when Cinemas reopen and all that. You can still see that it spoofs that Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer (gay?) bromance . Now don't get overexcited or offended - the undertones are there and they get spoofed here. If you are easily offended maybe do not watch this movie. Though you'd be missing out on many good jokes - from one third of the Zaz team ... he knows his stuff for sure! And the cast is amazing too.Bridges is on a roll here, as is Sheen and the others. The erotic scene of the movie is exactly that by the way ... hot and steamy, but also super funny. I sort of miss those cool spoof movies ... you could tell they loved movies and didn't just make fun of anything they saw ... there was much love ... and ridiculous insanity included.",Hot Shots!
4,lee_eisenberg,hotter and hotter,10,28 April 2006,"I've never seen ""Top Gun"", but as far as I'm concerned, ""Hot Shots!"" is sufficient! Since this is from the guys who gave us ""Airplane!"", that should tell you everything about it. There is actually a plot: loner Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) goes into the air force, and a series of goofy things ensue. But don't let that fool you. Just sit back and enjoy the gags (the one about the relatives should send you off the walls).As far as I'm concerned, Charlie Sheen really does work best in these kinds of roles. Also starring Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Lloyd Bridges. The sequel was absurd, but still quite funny.",Hot Shots!
5,jboothmillard,Hot Shots!,5,8 September 2005,"I remember seeing this film once before, but I hadn't sen the obvious main film spoofed before, so it was a good idea that I see this again having watched that film, from director Jim Abrahams (Airplane!, Ruthless People). Basically Lt. Sean 'Topper' Harley (Charlie Sheen) is an ace top gun fighter pilot called back into action from his secluded life with a Native American tribe by Lt. Cmdr. James Block (Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn). Serving on the S.S. Essess, he gains an enemy with other top gun pilot Lt. Kent Gregory (Cary Elwes), as they are both in love with the same woman, the beautiful Ramada Thompson (Valeria Golino). The mission for the squad is to destroy the nuclear plants of Saddam Hussein, but an aerospace company's owner is attempting sabotage, and Topper's personal demons are coming back when under pressure. In the end Topper manages to succeed with his regained abilities, he gets the girl, gains a friend in his original rival, and saves the day, before returning to his tribe life. Also starring Airplane!'s Lloyd Bridges as Admiral Thomas 'Tug' Benson, William O'Leary as Pete 'Dead Meat' Thompson, Kristy Swanson as Kowalski, Batman: The Animated Series' Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Wilson, Bill Irwin as Buzz Harley and Jon Cryer as Jim 'Wash Out' Pfaffenbach. If you have seen the films that have the mickey taken then you will get all the reference jokes, all with the added slapstick and stupidity element, it isn't quite the same spark as Airplane! or The Naked Gun, but it's not a bad spoof action comedy. Spoofs in the film include Top Gun, Dances with Wolves, Only Angels Have Wings, An Officer and a Gentleman, Gone with the Wind, Superman, Marathon Man, The Right Stuff and Full Metal Jacket. Worth watching!",Hot Shots!
6,rmax304823,You Can't Go Wrong Here.,7,3 April 2008,"Sometimes silly, more often outrageously funny, and always propelled, it's a relatively well-plotted comedy, with Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes competing for Valeria Golena and for the status of Top Gun in a Navy fighter squadron.If you've seen any of Jim Abraham's -- or Abraham's and Zuckerman's -- films before, no detailed description of the film or its comedic style is necessary, or even possible.There's a good deal of slapstick, which I'm inclined to overlook, but the gags are sometimes elegant and extremely funny. They often depend on taking figures of speech, or cinematic conventions, and interpreting them literally. Two brief examples.An admiral takes a pratfall. Aide: ""Are you alright, Admiral?"" Admiral (Loyd Bridges): ""Allright? Of course I'm alright. Why? What have you heard?"" A patient is being urgently wheeled down a hospital corridor, flanked by the usual coterie of staff in scrubs. The patient's worried friend asks: ""Can you save him?"" Doctor: ""I don't know. I'm not a very good doctor. (To the patient) Now this may hurt. (Bends down and bites the patient's nose savagely.)"" I don't want to go too far with this. There are sketches that parody all kind of popular movies. The main target is ""Top Gun,"" but we also have non sequiturs thrust in from ""Rocky"" and who knows how many others, many of which I couldn't identify.If you don't laugh out loud, you should see somebody about it.",Hot Shots!
7,BA_Harrison,Top Gun is funnier.,5,17 July 2011,"Having recently watched the entire god-awful Scary Movie series over four successive evenings, I vowed to do my chuckle muscles a favour and reacquaint myself with some of the genuinely hilarious 'send-ups' from my youth; so why the hell did I sit down and re-watch Hot Shots, which, although a slight improvement over the Wayans Brothers/David Zucker horror comedies, is far from a side-splitting classic? Most likely because I remember it as being funnier than it actually is, or maybe I was just confusing it with Part Deux.Whatever the reason, seeing the film again has done little to restore my love for the spoof genre, being a very hit and miss affair that primarily lampoons 80s blockbuster Top Gun, but also throws in random references to other films along the way. A few of the gags are funny (I enjoyed the silly repeat joke with the chihuahua), but the greater percentage fall flat on their face; given how rapid-fire the jokes are, that's an awful lots of groans over 84 minutes.I guess I'm going to have to go even further back through the annals of comedy to find a really good parody; I just hope that Airplane, Top Secret and The Naked Gun are actually as good as I think they are.",Hot Shots!
8,Quinoa1984,The funniest film of 1991.,8,8 July 2001,"Jim Abrahams' first solo comedy effort Hot Shots! is a smash comedy that has many, many laughs and is as silly as anything Abrahams has done with his uoltra successful team of ZAZ (Zucker Abrahams and Zucker) which made Airplane, Top Secret, The Naked Gun and The Kentucky Friend Movie.  Hot Shots deserves a place with them.Charlie Sheen plays a top gun type of charater that is trying to go against his father's reputation and still be able to fly and fight and all.  The movie however doesn't try and go with the plot, which is always good in these movies, and it succeeds in bringing silly, goofy laughs just by having Lloyd Bridges act totally and utterly hilariously insane, or in just having a pilot with moose antlers.  Deadpan.  A",Hot Shots!
9,Hey_Sweden,I've fallen for this movie like a blind roofer.,8,17 June 2012,"I can still remember seeing this movie in a theatre 21 years ago and cracking up at the various gags. Now, time and familiarity now lessen the impact of each gag but the movie remains good silly fun overall and a worthy successor to the ""Naked Gun"" franchise, having been co- written and directed by one third of the Z. A. Z. Team, Jim Abrahams.Here he and co-writer / executive producer Pat Proft delightfully skewer the ""fly boy"" movie, specifically ""Top Gun"", in its tale of a talented fighter pilot, Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen, who really is very good at this sort of thing) who's having a hard time dealing with the legacy of his dad Buzz (Bill Irwin), who was equally talented yet utterly reckless. Topper has to overcome his feelings in order to effectively serve as the anchor in a top secret mission, code named Sleepy Weasel. At the same time he aggressively pursues super sexy base psychiatrist Ramada (sultry Valeria Golino) and has various confrontations with vain, hostile pretty boy pilot Kent Gregory (Cary Elwes, who'd already proved his comedic abilities in ""The Princess Bride"").What continues to make ""Hot Shots!"" very pleasant and agreeable is its high quotient of successful jokes; there's very little here that falls flat, thanks to the wit and invention of Abrahams and Proft and the deft editing and pacing. Along the way the filmmakers take playful jabs at such movies as ""Superman"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Rocky"", ""Dances with Wolves"", and in a sequence that may make the viewer hungry as well as horny, ""9 1/2 Weeks"". The ""Dances with Wolves"" jokes are particularly hysterical as the disgraced Topper has shunned society to live with truly wacky Indians whose Chief likes to listen to MC Hammer on his Walkman.A lot of the absolute biggest chuckles, though, come from the performance of lovable old veteran Lloyd Bridges, whose association with Abrahams dated back to ""Airplane!"" when he'd first sent up his straight man image. Here he's the senile and hilarious Admiral who's prone to slurping pudding out of a coffee mug and mistaking a photograph for a window. ""Roy? ROY!"" A top notch supporting cast acquits themselves well, including Sheens' future 'Two and a Half Men' co-star Jon Cryer, William O'Leary, Kevin Dunn, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Kristy Swanson, and Heidi Swedberg, with small roles for the likes of Proft (as the lounge singer), film composer Marc Shaiman as the pianist, Ryan Stiles as the ill-fated ""Mailman"" Farnham, and Don Lake as the doctor.Inspired use is made of the song ""Dream Lover"", and Golino seriously smokes during a priceless rendition of ""The Man I love"". ""Hot Shots!"" is a fun flick that zips along engagingly, always with another great joke to come and a very bright wrap-up.Followed by a sequel two years later.Eight out of 10.",Hot Shots!
10,lastliberal,I'm a virgin. I'm just not very good at it.,6,9 May 2007,"Obviosly this was a spoof of Top Gun. I don't know why anyone needs to spoof Tom Cruise, as I feel he does pretty good job of spoofing himself with his jumping on the couch. Beside that, South Park spoof him better than anyone I've seen.Mel Brooks is the best at spoofs. They should t6ake some lessons from him. There were a few laughs here, but most of the gags were pretty stupid.I like Charlie Sheen, so I hung in there, but I will not be back.I have to say, Valeria Golino, where have you been all my life? Italian and Greek, just like Michael's wife in The Godfather. I see she is doing something with Harvey Keitel next year. I can hardly wait. I see also that she was in a take-off of James Nond. I'll have to check that out. I'll also have to look for Frida and Escape from L.A.",Hot Shots!
11,Boba_Fett1138,Stupid and lame but funny at the same time.,6,13 September 2003,"The movie is full with very, very stupid scene's that are funny at the same time which makes this movie in a way irresistible to watch.The story is just a lame excuse to make a movie full with jokes. So Basically the story serves no purpose at all and it are the jokes and the jokes only that make the movie. Some of the jokes are really lame and stupid and some of the jokes are so lame and stupid that they are actually funny. The humor is typical Jim Abrahams like and a must see for his fans and fans of Leslie Nielsen movies.I never thought I would say this but Charlie Sheen is unfortunately no Leslie Nielsen. He just is not the greatest comical talent I have seen. Cary Elwes however does surprising good and Lloyd Bridges is simply hilarious, I have to admit that I laughed at nearly every scene with him in it.Not the best comedy of all time but funny enough to watch over and over again.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Hot Shots!
12,view_and_review,How Many References Can You Name?,5,18 March 2020,"I like to see what movies I recognize being parodied in spoof movies. If it were still the early 90's, then I think I could've gotten all the references. As it is, I readily recognized four movies being parodied:""Top Gun"" (the primary basis for ""Hot Shots!"")""Days of Thunder""""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""""Dances With Wolves""And even though it's not a movie reference, the first Iraq War was going on at that time and there was a heavy dose of that parodied.That's about all I got. The movie wasn't all that good, it certainly was no ""Naked Gun.""",Hot Shots!
13,AlsExGal,Top Fun,8,11 September 2020,"If you are going to watch ""Top Gun"", please watch that film first before this one. It will make this film much funnier plus, Top Gun has not aged well and will seem cheesier than normal if you watch it last.This is the Abrahams & Abrahams style (""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"") parody of the 1986 Reagan era military action film, Top Gun. It is hilarious and nothing is sacred. It is probably one of the ten funniest films I have ever seen, but nothing is ever going to top Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles. I'll just say, don't think that if you find this film in the middle of the night and say ""this will be a good oldie to fall asleep to"" that you will do any such thing. I made that mistake.Charlie Sheen plays the troubled pilot Topper Harley that is the equivalent of Tom Cruise's character in Top Gun. Cary Elwes is his rival. In this film Topper Harley's love interest is his therapist, Ramada (Valeria Golino), instead of a physicist and Top Gun instructor. Because then they'd have to inject some science into this film and it would ruin everything.The jokes are just non stop. Sight gags are everywhere. There is a welcome home banner that actually says ""Welcome Home Banner"". And there is a send up of the food scene in ""9 1/2 Weeks"" (1986) that will have you never looking at olives quite the same. And Lloyd Bridges does a hilarious rendition of a clueless and completely incompetent Admiral, with one particularly great line to the villains of the film - ""You risked the lives of some damn fine pilots... and that's *my* job!""Notice that Jon Cryer costars in this film 12 years before he and Sheen starred in the TV series ""2 1/2 Men"". Is there a story there? Maybe.At any rates laughs are hard to come by these days. For absolutely stress free film watching that is wall to wall laughs with no chance of an Oscar worthy moment, this film still fits the bill.",Hot Shots!
14,Aaron1375,It would have probably been funnier for me if I had seen the movies it parodied.,7,7 July 2008,"Never really watched Top Gun and that is the movie this one takes the most shots at. Charlie Sheen is in the lead role here and he is very funny and good...I always think he is one of the funnier actors out there. Jon Cryer whom Charlie costars in two and a half men is also great in this one and Lloyd Bridges is right at home in a spoof movie. I also like Cary Elwes. The plot has a man recruiting the best pilots around, he recruits Topper Harley out of an Indian reservation and before you know it you are meeting the recruits and their fates in the case of ""Dead Meat"" who just has a wonderful family and everything is going right for. You of course have the meeting with the sexy lady that ends up with a rather bizarre love scene ala Nine and a Half Weeks involving foods. Still Lloyd Bridges takes the cake as the funniest guy in the movie as the man has had quite a few operations. This movie is a spoof though, so along with all the funny things going on, there are some dud jokes as well. This is also the type of spoof where it is dependent on you having seen the films it parodies for maximum effect.",Hot Shots!
15,Mr-Fusion,This flight is loaded down with gags,7,20 June 2017,"I'm not really sure how it is that I'd seen ""Part Deux"" a good five or six times as a teenager but never the first one. The humor in ""Hot Shots"" is as broad as possible, always trafficking in outright silliness. In that regard, not all of the jokes work, but the ones that do are knee-slappers. And Lloyd Bridges is comedy gold, I mean the man doesn't have one line that isn't a scream.And the humor doesn't even stop until the credits are done. Gotta respect that.7/10",Hot Shots!
16,namashi_1,Slap-Stick Fun!,10,19 December 2011,"Jim Abrahams 'Hot Shots!' is Slap-Stick Fun! It's deadpan hilarious & earns itself a viewing. Believe me, if you want to have a full-hearted laugh, then 'Hot Shots!' is waiting for you. 'Hot Shots!' Synopsis: A Parody of 'Top Gun', in which a talented but unstable fighter pilot must overcome the ghosts of his father and save a mission sabotaged by greedy weapons manufacturers.You can't look for logic in 'Hot Shots!'. This is Slap-Stick stuff, in which, it's the humor that has to work, nothing else. In that department, 'Hot Shots!' clicks & how. It parodies 'Top Gun' to the hilt, and the overall jokes & story-telling, is truly laugh-out-loud funny! Abrahams & Pat Proft's Screenplay is ingenious. Abrahams's direction on the other-hand, is highly energetic. Cinematography is satisfactory. Editing is decent. Performance-Wise: Late/Great Lloyd Bridges steals the show with a performance that will you in splits! Charlie Sheen is adequate. Cary Elwes is in full form. Valeria Golino is perfect. Jon Cryer brings the house down with several hilarious moments. Kevin Dunn is good. William O'Leary is passable. Ryan Stiles stands out in a small cameo.On the whole, 'Hot Shots!' is Slap-Stick Cinema At Its Best!",Hot Shots!
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I have to admit, I actually laughed more than few times",7,28 November 2006,"I'm not sure why, but I guess I was interested in seeing the first Hot Shots since my mom only has the sequel and I noticed the movie in Blockbuster, I also love Charlie Sheen in comedies, he works so well in spoofs. Not to mention all in all, I do love spoofs, most work for me. It's just the kind comedy that I like. Hot Shots! proved itself to be a worthy spoof that is more than worth watching. It spoofs Top Gun, An Officer and a Gentleman, 9 1/2 Weeks, Gone with the Wind, Rocky, among many other movies.Topper is a pilot who is wanted back in the navy and falls for a woman, but he has an edge is considered a rebel. Cary Elwes gives him a hard time constantly, especially since his father caused Cary's father to have a freak plane accident. Cary is also in love with Topper's woman and wants revenge.Hot Shots is a great comedy that I have to admit is a guilty pleasure, but it has so much that most comedies lack now a days. It's just a fun innocent movie that deserves a little bit of a higher rating. Charlie Sheen rocks in comedies, although they have destroyed my new favorite guilty pleasure, 9 1/2 Weeks, it's all good.7/10",Hot Shots!
18,disdressed12,"an amusing,sometimes hysterical spoof on top gun",7,11 October 2006,"the movie hot shots is obviously a broad comedy.you really have to look at the big picture to understand its genius.it's sort of like the monty python gang doing their take on hamlet and playing it straight.that's the genius of hotshots,that the actors play it as if they too were doing hamlet.of course there are several funny bits contained in the movie,and two sequences which are absolutely hysterical.but it is the intentional over the top acting that really makes this movie.i suspect they may have had to do numerous takes for many scenes, because the actors could not keep a straight face.the dialogue is brilliant in this movie and delivered perfectly deadpan every time.and of course there is also some physical comedy,which doesn't hurt.this was a much more enjoyable movie than the naked gun series. i also must mention lloyd bridges who played a very important,and very dimwitted admiral.there are many absurd scenes which are brilliantly overacted.this is a fast paced movie, which kept me interested to the very end. 6.75*",Hot Shots!
19,OllieSuave-007,First class comedy spoof!,10,15 May 2016,"This is a comedy from Jim Abrahams, spoofing Top Gun in which unstable fighter pilot Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) tries to complete his mission of destroying the Iraqi dictator's nuclear plants.It's non-stop laughs from start to finish, from unending gags to hilarious spoofs of movies such as Top Gun, Superman and Gone with the Wind. The acting was great, each character delivering funny performances that made the plot entertaining and engaging. I especially liked Lloyd Bridge's clueless and comedic performance as the incompetent Adm. Thomas Benson.This movie is not so much dumb as is pure fun and entertainment, as all the characters acted seriously on their ""missions."" The film has a fast-paced plot and story nonetheless, despite all the spoofed humor. It's a great comedy - ranking up there with the Naked Gun and Airplane films! Grade A",Hot Shots!
20,Lejink,Top shot,7,18 January 2011,"Well, I'm a sucker for James Brooks' spoofs of popular films and even though I've (purposely) never watched ""Top Gun"", I laughed loud and often at the million and one gags offered here. Charlie Sheen plays it deadpan throughout, with Valeria Golino adding some Latin passion as his ""torn between two lovers"" psychiatrist and of course Lloyd Bridges replaying his patented Patton gone mad routine.References to numerous other Hollywood blockbusters from the recent and not so recent past abound, as per usual, the funniest being the skit on ""The Fabulous Baker Brothers"" and the ""frying tonight"" send up of ""9 1/2 weeks"" (you should see what this girl can do with an olive!). There are as many sight as verbal gags and naturally the scattergun approach means that one or two of the jokes will have you wincing, but don't worry, a belly laugh will be along soon enough. And for what it's worth, the flying circus shots are very well done. I have ""Part Deux"" recorded and will hasten to watch it the very next time I need a good laugh after a long day at work - that'll be soon then!",Hot Shots!
21,ElMaruecan82,Not as good as I remembered...,6,14 June 2017,"Maybe the passing of time had an effect on me but I'm not sure I would praise ""Hot Shots!"" like my 16-year old counterpart did when he first saw it. This is not the first time my enthusiasm fades over the years, I had the same reaction with ""Spaceballs"" recently but I still enjoyed ""Top Secret!"" and ""The Naked Gun"". So, I feel quite fair and if I list the ten reasons why I didn't enjoy ""Hot Shots!"".1- Charlie Sheen can't carry a whole movie, let alone a comedy, there is just something blank and 'soulless' (I stole that line from Homer Simpson) in this actor's eyes that having a whole film depending on it isn't the biggest favor you're doing it. A Leslie Nielsen, he's not, but even when compared to Val Kilmer, Todd Hayes or Bill Pullman, he fails to equal them as the straight-guy-but-not-too-much-so-he-can-be-funny. He even managed to ruin the ""Nine Weeks and Half"" moment. To his defense, he's not helped by the rest of the cast that looks as bored as he is, except for Lloyd Bridges.2- And they even managed to ""overuse"" Lloyd Bridges and his war wounds jokes.3- Now that I think about it, Cary Elwes might have been an interesting Topper Harley, he proved his ability for comedy in ""The Princess Bride"".4- The film has the same problem than ""Spaceballs"" actually, it explores a type of material that is already a matter of not to be taken seriously, ""Top Gun"" was already an unintentionally funny movie so trying to provoke intentional laughs with elements that make fun of things that are funny without trying is like ordering sushi just because you need rice. The purpose of a parody movie is to work on unpredictability, to provide a twist on the usual tropes, that's why ""Naked Gun"" was good, it didn't target a specific movie, it was about a genre. But ""Hot Shots!"" is so busy parodying all the ""Top Gun"" and US. Navy movies it was unchained to a limiting premise.5- It is badly edited. And I don't care if a parody, it's still a movie, and some shots were rather cheap looking. The part where Valeria Golino makes a few acrobatic moves before landing on the horse shows such an obvious cut. Why should that be intentional? It's funnier if it feels like she did that stunt.Halfway through this review, I feel the need to mention that some parts were still hilarious, like the ""Dances With Wolves"" helium moment, the running-gag involving the Chihuahua, and the whole set-up before the obligatory death of one of the partners. In fact, the whole ""Deadmeat"" part has that energy and spice it lacked through the film. The ""Only You"" part was cute but nothing more. Now, to the list.6- The plot is unclear and unfocused. I know that a plot shouldn't matter in this specific brand of humor but only in the case where we're so carried away by the laughs that the plot is pointless. ""Hot Shots!"" is structured around the trauma of Topper, some secret mission in Iraq, and another scheme lead by the Kevin Dunn's character, which is rather under-cooked.7- Too many slow moments and too many jokes falling flat, by that I mean that they mostly feel like smirk worthy filler. The jokes treating jet planes like cars were already retreads of some hilarious gags from ""Airplane!"", a soldier sounding the bugle and being instantly trampled (ha-ha), the female pilot telling Topper he's a great guy, ""so you are"" (how, original) and ""the drink is on the house"" followed by masses of people invading the place, coming out of nowhere. Tex Avery did a better job by making everyone drink on the roof. Rather warm humor for a film called ""Hot Shots!"".8- The other ZAZ film of the same year, the sequel of ""The Naked Gun"" was much funnier so they still got it after all.9- In the 90's, parody wasn't exactly the it thing and movies like ""Wayne's World"" have proved that it takes more than mocking a previously viewed material to garner people's laughs, so, yes, there is something old-fashioned in ""Hot Shots!"", something that was fresh in the 80's but stopped to be at the 90's, it's just slightly better than the Leslie Nielsen flops of the late 90's, but it was announcing that disastrous trend.10- Finally, the most embarrassing moment, the most cringe-worthy, is the portrayal of Arabs. Yeah, you wouldn't care because you're part of the 'winning team', but in today's context, this has aged badly and dangerously. I don't mean Arabs being the bad guys, Germans aren't exactly boy scouts in ""Die Hard"", but they're marginalized group enough not to be both mocked and demonized. Having these pilots named ""Hummus"", ""Baklava"" and speaking gibberish like Couscous, Chich Kebab and having the guts to mix it with ""Allah Akbar"" made me wonder if the ZAZ weren't a bit anti-Arabs after all. I don't know, just thinking of the ""Naked Gun"" opening scene deepened that certitude.Laughs are supposed to be cathartic, if the film mocks the patriotic undertones of some Navy movies, it mocks the 'bad guys' with so much more contempt and offensiveness that you start taking it seriously after all. I know Saddam was the bad guy, I know the film was probably released at the midst of the Gulf War, and the ""dream became reality"" a few years after, look at what's became of Iraq now that the Public Enemy n°1 is gone.I want a parody or a comedy to make me chill, not to make me realize how one-sided and twisted the world is. The film ends with a song I love: ""Dream Love"", well, I have a dream when that never-ending cycle with Arabs as Hollywood or media bad guys will come to an end.",Hot Shots!
22,cricketbat,This spoof film flies high above the others,9,23 March 2021,"I know Hot Shots is a dumb movie, but it's the good kind of dumb that makes me laugh. Charlie Sheen is playing his role as Topper Harley so seriously that this could have been a drama, but the jokes are just too quick and too plentiful. This lampoons a number of movies, and features some gags that I laugh at just thinking about them. This spoof film flies high above the others.",Hot Shots!
23,lesleyharris30,"Decent Comedy Thats Better Than What It Parodies,",7,13 March 2013,"Hot Shots is a good movie with a good story line,a great cast and plenty of hilarious scenes.Its from one of the writers of Airplane and Naked Gun,but this movie certainly doesn't have as memorable or funny scenes,and no lines that you will find yourself quoting for the rest of your life.But its still a decent funny movie,better than Top Gun,the movie it parodies,I'm never been a big fan of Top Gun because its just very boring and extremely cheesy.I did get a good kick out of seeing Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer,starring alongside each other long before Two And A Half Men,I find Jon Cryer very funny,and is the only reason why I still watch the new Two And A Half Men episodes.Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) must save a mission that has been sabotaged by weapon manufacturers.",Hot Shots!
24,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Good for a style of movie I generally don't like,8,2 November 2012,"Over the last few years I have come to dislike these types of movies; ones such as Naked Gun and Spy Hard, and I even wondered why I had this movie as a part of my collection. Then I watched it again and realised why: it is actually quite funny in my opinion. Hot Shots! has a plot but in these types of movies it is not really important to follow it. This movie is based more around the gags than the plot and if the gags stink, then so does the movie.The gags in Hot Shots! are actually quite clever. There is the reoccurring gag of the Chihuahua which everybody inadvertently sits on. Hot Shots is mostly a take off of movies like Top Gun and Only Angels Have Wings. Not only that, there is also the take off of conspiracy movies and Dances With Wolves. The movie also takes of clichés, such as the man who is trying to overcome the guilt of his father's death. There is a bit of slapstick, but this is not the type of comedy that makes the movie. Rather the comedy is just really over board. This movie I like.",Hot Shots!
25,zkonedog,The King of Sight Gags,8,11 March 2017,"Here's the basic formula for dissecting this film: If ""Airplane"" spoofed a single film (in this case ""Top Gun"") instead of an entire genre (disaster films), you'd get ""Hot Shots"".For a basic plot summary, ""Hot Shots"" basically spoofs the movie ""Top Gun"" with any and all types of sight gags included. Charlie Sheen, Valeria Golino, Cary Elwes, and Lloyd Bridges provide the starring roles, and are all hilarious in every scene they carry.For some people, this type of humor is childish and won't elicit much more than a simple chuckle. For others (myself included), though, the sight gags and hilarious physical comedy will have you in tears of laughter. The chemistry between Sheen and Golino is incredible, Elwes is at his maniacal best, while Bridges basically steals the show as the hilarious old general who always seems to save the day in the end.This is a film that is kind of hard to explain in print. You really just need to sit down and watch it to determine if it is the right kind of comedy for you. You'll know within the first few minutes.",Hot Shots!

27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Same old spoof from Abrahams and Proft,5,7 December 2009,"Having seen the terrific ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" I felt like there was very little ""need"" to make ""Hot Shots!,"" a spoof of ""Top Gun"" and other military and non-military movies. Its predecessors targeted entire genres that deserved to be made fun of: disaster movies (""Airplane!"") and cop movies/TV shows (""The Naked Gun""). ""Hot Shots!"" takes aim at too broad a spectrum and despite a few good performances is really just that same old subtle and literal humor from two of the writers of those previous fantastic spoof movies, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft.The plot is incredibly immaterial in ""Hot Shots!"" Anyone used to watching one of the spoof movies from these writers is trained by now to look for the jokes hidden throughout. In ""Hot Shots!"" more of those jokes are forced in and don't tie in to the plot that they completely detract from it. I can't say I gave the film a concerted effort, but I don't remember what it was about other than ace pilot Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) being afraid to fly because of the death of his father.Sheen, although not bad, is also not the type of comedian to best handle this kind of material. He's no Leslie Nielsen in ""The Naked Gun"" and not even really a Robert Hays (""Airplane!"") who might not be as good an actor in general, but knew how to play this kind of humor. Part of this could be that his character is written to be a hot shot, but either way it just doesn't make ""Hot Shots!"" lovable.Still good for those one-time laughs when you catch a clever or ridiculous joke, ""Hot Shots!"" is not a failure by any means, just same old, same old. Topper cooking breakfast on Valeria Golino's midriff instead of a sex scene is remarkably crazy and hilarious and being from the Midwest, I appreciated that the Native American language consisted mostly of towns in Wisconsin. Any film attributed to Abrahams, Proft or the Zuckers is always going to have its gems, but ""Hot Shots!"" as an overall film doesn't work as well as the classics they churned out in the '80s.",Hot Shots!
28,videorama-759-859391,Not so hot,5,12 July 2016,"Hot Shots is a fun movie to watch, but funny, NO. For me, the gags just kept misfiring, or falling on their arse. Essentially, this is a parody off of Top Gun, with a more likable hero and gifted pilot, Topper Harley-love the name, played by Sheen Jnr in an adequate performance. He's called back into action, on a mission, where he's set to take a fall, by some dirty dudes, one taking a huge fall at the end of the film off the tarmac, but of course, good conquers over evil. Topper falls for the sexy young navy doctor/cabaret singer (the delicious, Golino).Cryer, another Two And A Half Men favorite, plays a navy pilot with not the best eyes, demoted to aerial patrol. Faces to him seem bigger and more intrusive. Not to say, this film isn't without warranting a viewing. I still quite like it, regardless, mainly cause of seeing Sheen in this kind of role, back when he was doing many films. Cary Elwes plays, like a warring, begrudging, pilot of Topper's, like Goose to his Maverick. Even the King is dredged up to a Tom Jones number. This movie to me, still quite a fascinating view if you can grasp, what I mean, but laughter wise, the gags kept on missing. Another Two And A Half Men co star, Ryan Stiles, stars as the memorable Mailman, who plane went down. He flew with Topper's father, considered the best pilot in the game, but Hot Shots certainly isn't the best in the Flying High creator's books. Sorry.",Hot Shots!

This is obviously a spoof of ""Top Gun,"" but also pokes fun at other classic films like ""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""Superman."" Sheen (Wall Street) plays Topper, a navy pilot who has issues mainly dealing with his father's death. Soon, he's recruited to lead a mission to destroy a nuclear plant with other fighter pilots and they eventually learn that someone's sabotaging the planes. Golino (Rain Man) plays Ramada, a psychiatrist whom he gets help and finds romance with, Elwes (The Princess Bride) plays Kent, a pilot and Ramada's ex-boyfriend who doesn't get along with Topper, Cryer (Two and a Half Men) plays pilot, Washout who has walleye vision and the late, Bridges (Airplane) plays senile Admiral, Tug Benson.

Turn off your intelligence, leave your common sense and thinking cap at the door, and just enjoy. It is quite mindless fun, and holds nothing Top Gun to be sacred.

Charlie Sheen stars whilst Valeria Golino, Cary Elwes, Jon Cryer and Lloyd Bridges co-star. But like it's brethren the humor is real dated and some of the jokes don't work like they used to.

33,gcd70,A good laugh,6,17 August 2007,"Basically a send-up of ""Top Gun"", in this new 'Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker' style film Jim Abrahams manages to throw up many other references to films such as ""Superman"", ""Rocky"" and ""Dances With Wolves"". Charlie Sheen, in quite an unaccustomed role, seems to enjoy himself thoroughly while Valeria Golino and Cary Elwes have fun in supporting roles. It is Lloyd Bridges who steals the show however, as an hilarious Navy admiral.Though certainly not the best we've seen from this camp, it is always a good laugh, ""Hot Shots"" is another Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker production worth a look.Friday, December 13, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne""Hot Shots"" is still quite funny a second time, and Lloyd Bridges still hilarious.

34,Enchorde,Extremely funny comedy classic,8,4 March 2005,"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Topper Harley (Sheen), a mentally instable, kicked out fighter pilot is brought back by The Navy to join a secret squadron led by Lt Cmdr Block (Dunn) and above all, Admiral Benson (Bridges). Harley's problem is that he has never been able to cope with an incident his father, also a fighter pilot, was involved in and disgraced by. His place in the squadron is questioned by the other pilots, especially by Gregory (Elwes). Matters complicate even more when they fight over the same woman, psychologist Ramada Thompson (Golino). And there are some hidden scheme running behind the scenes as well, one that may jeopardize the entire mission.Comments: Although the story would have been good enough for other movies, forget it, it's not important. The only use it has here is to be a framework for funny details subplots lines and so forth. And the movie is full of them. The writers must have had a field day when they wrote it, and wrote it well. Then they left it to actors that too good care of it. Bridges and Sheen is stellar, Golino and Elwes very good with good support from other cast. The result is a very funny comedy classic that somewhat set the standard for years to come...8/10",Hot Shots!

The biggest issue I have is the fact that there are so many jokes, you can miss some while you're laughing hysterically at others.A parody of ""Top Gun"" with some other film favourites thrown in for good measure, it is a laugh a minute almost literally.

After not watching this film for such a long time, I came into this viewing wit ha more trained eye, and to say the least, it was as good then as it is now. This is easily one of those parody movies that will live forever, especially due to all of the great scenes on the aircraft carriers (dogs chasing the plane, the dancing, etc.). While the film did have its dull moments, there were too many funny moments. Charlie Sheen seemed perfect for this role, simply because it looked like he tackled this movie with a serious purpose. Cary Elwes was also good, considering the stuffy Brit took on the whole comedy role quite well. Kudos to all who had a hand in this film.",Hot Shots!

Some of the jokes try too hard to get a laugh, but a lot of them work quite good.Consider this movie is from Jim Abrahams, one of the directors from 'Airplane!' and 'Top Secret!', and you know you have a very funny movie here.

38,philip_vanderveken,Hot Shots is one of my favourite movies when it comes to comedy.,7,20 September 2004,"Hot Shots is one of my favorite movies when it comes to comedy. It was made in a time that farting and burping weren't yet considered as the very best humor has to offer. This film is very enjoyable when you don't know any of the movies this parody has been based on (very hard to believe), but when you do know the movies, Hot Shots is really hilarious from time to time. Most of the time they make fun of Top Gun, but movies like Superman, Dances with Wolves, Gone with the Wind... can be recognized in it as well. Topper Harley is an excellent pilot who left the navy because he couldn't cope with the feelings of guilt over his father. His father didn't do enough to help his co-pilot during a mission and the poor man got killed in an awful way. When he found out, Topper decided never to fly again. He now lives on his own with an Indian and a wolf, inhaling helium. However, when Lt Commander Block offers a second chance, to take part in secret mission Sleepy Weasel, Topper decides to fly again, although this means that he'll have to deal with a difficult love interest and his old fears.This movie certainly scores above average when you ask me.

40,TheUnknown837-1,"personally, I prefer ""Part Deux"", but the original ""Hot Shots!"" does have its moments, however isolated they may be",6,22 October 2009,"Like its much superior sequel, ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"", the original 1991 picture ""Hot Shots!"" is exactly the sort of spoof-parody that a major moviegoer will enjoy, even though this one only scraped the surface for me. It's not a parody of one movie entire. Rather, it encompasses its world in the setting of a one-movie parody and then within that world, throws jokes and references and satirical gags at us over and over again for eighty-four minutes without end. The movie it imitates in look and plot is the Tom Cruise career-launcher ""Top Gun"", but it's really also a parody of ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990), ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""Gone With the Wind"" (1939) and many others.One thing I can't gripe about is the casting. It's terrific and thankfully the majority of this cast was preserved for the sequel. Charlie Sheen, though perfectly competent as a serious, deterministic actor, proves he can also be very funny and yet charming at the same time. Valeria Golino brilliantly manages to work out a charming character from a one-note performance from one-note material. And there's Lloyd Bridges, who never fails to crack a laugh as a bumbling, rather idiotic military admiral who seems to have had to replace some part of his body since he seems to have been in just about every single battle of every single war of the past sixty years.So what did not work for me? Well, simply because I only grinned here and there at the way the parodies and jokes were staged as opposed to the way I rolled on the floor laughing at them in the sequel ""Hot Shots! Part Deux."" In addition, some of the character connection, I felt, was not quite, well, connected the way it should have. I don't mean it had be locked down, but a little more so that it is. Cary Elwes, for example, gets second-billing, but I didn't feel any real sense of play from his character and yes, even in a movie like ""Hot Shots!"", there still needs to be some sense of place, as there was in the sequel, even if it's just random space. In the end, I laughed at ""Hot Shots!"", but not nearly enough to fully recommend it. My suggestion is to, ironically enough, see the sequel first. It's funnier, more random, more whacky, sillier, has a better stage of jokes and movie satire. And then, if you're interested, come back and see ""Hot Shots!"".",Hot Shots!

Charlie Sheen is excellent as Topper Harley the main character of this show. It is a parody of Top Gun and it is spot on!! Valeria Golino does a nice job and she is super hot (pun intended) in the 9 1/2 Weeks scene. The humor, puns, and overall parody is just hilarious in my opinion. The coed barracks scenes . Why Kristie Swanson took her role is beyond me. She never really did much in the movie. Wash Out is played very well by John Cryer and Dead Meat is such a douche but also very funny. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is the greedy defense contractor who has corrupted the performance data of his equipment with the help of one of the officers involved with the tests. Of course he gets his in the end. I think the closing scenes when the credits roll are extremely funny. I think this is one kick ass movie.",Hot Shots!
43,phubbs,Hot Shots!,6,11 April 2015,"Back in 1986 there was a movie called 'Top Gun', you might have heard of it, it did quite well. During casting the young Charles Sheen was considered for the main role in the movie (later taken by Cruise), his brother Emilio turned down the role! Well later on down the line we got this spoof which really does seem like Sheen's late audition for the real deal. Its odd because in a way you could actually see him in the role of Maverick, its not a stretch, and here you do feel he's making the best of it to show us all just that (my thoughts).There have been many spoofs over the years but this franchise is generally considered to be one of the best alongside 'The Naked Gun' trilogy. Its of course no surprise that all the best spoofs have been written and directed (one or the other) by Jim Abrahams, the dude has a knack. Everyone knows the drill here, you can tell from the movie logo alone, as said the film sends up 'Top Gun' from start to finish whilst including the odd pot shots at various other movies. The difference with this movie unlike newer spoofs was the fact this actually had a proper story and mainly parodied one movie, it wasn't just a collection of silly skits.The plot isn't entirely scene for scene the same as that Scott movie though, it differs of course but in general much is the same right down to the main soundtrack. Sheen plays the dark haired, good looking, brash young pilot Topper, his arch nemesis is the blonde haired, good looking, by the books Kent (Elwes), and they are both after the frizzy haired Ramada (Golino). I never really understood how Golino got this part because she isn't much of a looker in my view but hey. Other pilots are a clichéd bunch highlighted by Jon Cryer as the near blind Pfaffenbach (he has wall-eye vision) but the stand out performer for the movie has to be Lloyd Bridges as Tug Benson. This guy nailed every scene he's in, he clearly knew how to perform comedy and it shows, his visual skills were just as good as his verbal skills. Bridges has to be one of the two best spoof comedy actors ever, the other being Leslie Nielsen.The best thing about these movies was obviously the humour, some of it was childish, some of it clever and witty, yet at times some was also surprisingly adult. But it wasn't just the easy visual gags that made this hilariously smart, it was the hidden gems, the tiny visual nods n winks that you may have missed the first time around. The film has many (sort of) secret Easter eggs strewn throughout which some folks will pick up and others might not, depending on your country of origin and how much of a movie buff you are. Even now I can read about this flick and find things out I never knew. Of course other than that there are the blatant movie parodies and cheap slapstick gags that cater for all ages, some being very good with excellent levels of detail (Rocky sequence), others just being dumb and maybe even somewhat cringeworthy these days (Superman sequence).Like most spoofs the movie is a product of its time with many gags, visual or otherwise, referencing issues of the time or current pop culture (of the time). Although this does still work to a degree it has waned over time which is to be expected. Its now very odd to think that Saddam Hussein was once such a threat and iconic figure...so to speak. So much time has passed since the 90's and the Gulf War it felt strange watching a movie where Saddam was the villain and parodied, not sure why but I guess because it doesn't seem that long ago and I was a young teen at the time. Its only watching now you realise...holy hummus! it was along time ago! Christ I'm old!By the predictable finale the movie has well established itself as a solid spoof with some classic moments of comedy no doubt. The jet fighter aerial sequences are a clear montage of real footage, other movie footage and some highly dubious model work, but the film embraces the cheesiness with open arms. At no point does the movie try for spectacular effects, its all hokey as hell and looks like a cartoon, although there are some neat tricks to be seen. Personally I enjoy segments of this, some stuff works really well, others don't, back in the day I kinda felt the same truth be told. For me the movie heavily depended on the brilliance of Bridges' rubber- faced versatility and the small hints of Cryer, but overall its still a highly accurate spoof of the hefty testosterone infused 80's.'you risked the lives of some damn fine pilots...and that's my job'6/10",Hot Shots!

Lloyd Bridges is almost the most hilarious as the clueless admiral ('Holy cow, my cap blew off. Swing her round we'll pick it up. But sir we're on the mission. Good thinking, yeah, we'll pick it up on the way back. Got to mark the spot though. Put Robinowitz in a life raft, have him row in circles until we return. It could be days.

It's not another woman I just couldn't compete with that. No, of course you couldn't.'), Ryan Stiles is pretty darn funny as the animal man mail man (Squirrel's nest!), Kevin Dunn is real funny as the helium hitting lt. commander ('Duck, sir. Are you alright, sir? Of course I'm alright. Why? What have you heard? Nothing, sir.'), William O'Leary's funny as Dead Meat ('Wendy, I can fly!'), Jon Cryer is very funny as the cross-eyed cannibal ('If it helps I didn't have seconds.'), Kristy Swanson is so funny and so epically gorgeous as the chesty mister (You eyeballing me, mister? No, sir!), Valeria Golino is really really hilarious as the sexy shrink ('Those are some long legs. I just had them lengthened. Now they go all the way up.') and so so beautiful ('You've got to be joking. Look if I were joking I would of said, what do you do with an elephant with three balls?

But the real standout is the late Lloyd Bridges (RIP) as the laugh out funny Adm. Thomas 'Tug' Benson (he's even more hilarious as President Benson in the sequel!).

Charlie Sheen plays the main character Topper Harley, and we can see Lloyd Bridges as a stupid man, as always and Cary Elwes.The movie makes a fool out of the 80ties classic ""Top Gun"" all the way and has dozens of hilarious scenes. My big favourite is when Topper comes driving on his bike and sees his coming love riding on a horse, this excellent song rolls and Topper starts doing the same things as the woman on the horse, this is comedy history! The movie is filled with small, funny scenes and that makes it funny all the way.It's much better then the sequel, though that one is also very nice. Hot Shots! features things that's fantastic, small stuff, as when a pilot lands his fighter he has been on the store, or when a female pilot comes too Topper and says something like: ""You're a real man"" - he anwers her: ""So are you!""Or when Topper makes egg and bacon on the stomach of his love, its funny, and I really recommend it.

Best of all are the little gags you see in the background, like when the recruits do a kick-line circle in the window behind Col. Benson's desk.  And kudos to Valeria Golino for having the most talented navel in movies!",Hot Shots!
54,Horror-yo,A little bit of surrealistic fun,6,4 October 2016,"Jim Abrahams, the director and co-writer of this film, is known for his completely wacky comedic adventures featuring antihero protagonists and absolutely stereotypical characters and villains, with notably the Airplane or Naked Gun series.Here, the theme is military, the lead is a young Charlie Sheen, and it's just about what one would expect out of these converging elements. Some parts are really funny, where the absurd is taken to a point made necessary to laugh, but mostly there's a lot of very forgettable filler, and the plot is obviously extremely thin, not that this would constitute a flaw for this sort of film but we're really not given too much else and have to settle for the on screen fun from scene to scene which there just isn't masses of.All in all it's alright, something of a fun watch, better than other similar efforts gone awry.",Hot Shots!
55,PIST-OFF,somewhat dated but very funny movie,8,2 July 2002,"Charlie Sheen is cool, Valerie Golina is beautiful, Llyod Bridges is funny.

56,EthanBJones_03,Why does this receive so much praise? Wouldn't Recommend,2,27 April 2017,"Directed by Jim AbramsStarring Charlie Sheen, Valeria Golerino and Lloyd BridgesGeneral:Overall: I understand that comedy is subjective and I am fine with that. People will find this movie funny and I accept that. I won't accept poor acting, stupid story and horrible effects. Don't give me that rubbish 'It's a parody' because great parodies have competent stories and acting. I laughed ONCE during this film. That's not good. People will find this funny and I can understand that but I believe that comedies should, or at least attempt to, include comedy/offence that everyone can enjoy. Parodies like 'Scary Movie' feature toilet humour, references, cringe comedy - it reaches a wide variety of humour and understands that its not supposed to just appeal to one specific demographic. I could comment on the cinematography, or even the genuinely bad acting but that would be redundant because the comedy is the only point I need to make. If you like this, then fine but don't scream in my face that it's comedic genius and should be given a spot on the Greatest Films of All Time list because no comedy should. In summary, this movie will appeal a specific demographic(which I can't decide who that demographic is) and maybe children but aside from that I can't recommend it.The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of stupid, cartoony comedy that's essentially 'Tom and Jerry' meets 'Looney Toons' with a vague splash 'Top Gun' sprinkled in there. Wouldn't Recommend!Detailed:None of the actors in this film do good jobs. I realise that it can be hard to judge acting with comedy(especially in spoofs) but I just don't see any effort or charm that any of them posses. It's a stupid and boring plot followed by a stupid and boring ending. Honestly, the cinematography was fine in the movie. It was competently shot and wasn't too poorly edited either.The costume and set design were fine. The effects were truly, truly awful and just looked fake. This movie was just so boring and so unfunny that it actually made me question what people will accept as art or comedy.I found ONE joke in the movie funny and, to be fair, that was a very funny joke. I'm not gonna say it wasn't but aside from that one joke, the rest of the film was so bland for me that I just couldn't enjoy any of it.2/10Wouldn't Recommend",Hot Shots!
57,Rammstein-2,It stands out,6,11 February 2000,"Hot Shots! is the only film of its kind that I actually have taken a liking to. Mostly because I love aircraft and Top Gun. Otherwise, this kind of humor is greatly overrated - it's a bit childish and somewhat tiresome to see people get hurt in hundreds of different ways. But this film is bearable.",Hot Shots!
58,HelenMary,Brilliantly funny spoof film,7,16 February 2014,"In the line of Airplane, Naked Gun and the Files of the Police Squad, Hot Shots is one of those films that you can watch again and again and see extra jokes that you hadn't noticed before. There are great ""set piece"" jokes but also the humour that comes from knowing the in-joke and in this film that is mainly at the expense of Top Gun.Charlie Sheen sizzles in this film, and is at his comedic best, and John Cryer (also of Two and Half Men fame) is very good, but it is Lloyd Bridges that steals the show in every scene he's in. Love this film, I've seen it so many times but still giggle at all the silliness, and am still seeing new things. It's a nineties classic comedy. The fridge contents bedroom scene is one of the funniest pieces of film ever.Enjoyable, fun, funny and brilliantly clever, though of course not original as it's more or less one long spoof. Never mind though!",Hot Shots!
59,Donatien3,A lot of silly fun,7,7 March 2021,"A parody of ""Top Gun"" (which in itself is hard to take seriously), ""Hot Shots!"" is jam packed with lots of silly little sight gags.While modern parody movies are more concerned with overdone pop culture references and celebrity impersonations, ""Hot Shots"" embraces the silliness: it's not particularly sophisticated, but it doesn't need to be; instead it throws out as many gags as possible to see what sticks.Charlie Sheen is the Tom Cruise-esque Topper Harley, joined by his future ""Two and a Half Men"" cast mate Jon Cryer, as well as Cary Elwes, and love interest Valeria Golino. Lloyd Bridge, as the slightly senile war vet admiral, gets a lot of best - and goofiest - lines, often tying back to the damage he took during his fighting days.The BBQ/sex scene between Topper and Ramada (Golino) is a highlight, and is referenced again at the end of the movie when they reunite. The elaborate foreshadowing of Dead Meat's death is another highlight.Like the best parody movies, ""Hot Shots!"" is packed with gags and is a perfect chill out movie: while not quite in the realm of classics like ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" trilogy, there's still plenty of silliness to enjoy.",Hot Shots!

Maybe I need to watch TOP GUN first I guess.",Hot Shots!
61,ThomasColquith,Surprisingly Endearing,8,2 July 2021,"I just watched ""Hot Shots"" for the first time ever, somehow I had missed this film until now, and it was better than I anticipated. It is a surprisingly endearing film. Sure, some of the gags are dumb and they didn't all work for me, but when the film was over I was thoroughly entertained and left wanting more. The actors were great, especially Charlie and Valeria, they exuded chemistry, in fact they were one of my favorite on-screen couples in any film. Such a sizzling romance surprised me, I was not expecting that from this movie, and it surpassed the actual ""Top Gun"" in this regard in my opinion. And the final scene was a great ending that left me laughing, I won't give away the lines. The music was great as well. So, I would recommend this film for a light-hearted comedy which will entertain and not make you think too much; it's perfect for when you may feel under the weather. 8/10.",Hot Shots!
62,ssvikas,The mother of all Spoofs!,8,7 February 2008,"Hot Shots, I would say is one mother of all spoofs! The others I loved include the Scary Movie series, Johnny English, Austin Powers, etc. But, this one takes the cake. Though just a short movie, just over an hour, it packs in tons of humor, though logic defying, will keep you thoroughly entertained and give a year’s dose of laughter therapy!Topper Harley played by Charlie Sheen is a dropout Navy Pilot living among Indians. He is called back to duty for a top secret mission and it appears that someone doesn’t want this mission to succeed. Adding to the fun are Lloyd Bridges as the dumb boss Admiral Benson and Valeria Golino as the much sought after base psychiatrist.Of the many movies that it spoofs, the most notable is Top Gun. There is a little bit of boxing from Rocky, at bit from the old Gone with the Wind, and many more movies. The lead characters are really very hilarious. There’s no point discussing scenes coz it would amount to a Spoiler. Well, I am curious to see its sequel, Hot Shots! Part Deux.The action packed nature of this movie along with unbelievable stunts gives the much needed spice. If you would ask me to pick up the best sequence of all, I would pick the adventurous amorous scene between Sheen & Golino. It’s actually difficult to pick one best scene among many! About song, ‘dream lover’ seen with the credits is a nice one.",Hot Shots!
63,Christopher_Reid,Very stupid and very funny,9,3 May 2021,"Part of why Hot Shots! Works is that the actors are good and take it seriously. Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes are talented actors who have been in many good and serious films, along with much of the rest of the cast. It's much funnier when ridiculous and immature lines and jokes are delivered seriously, as if the characters are completely oblivious to the jokes. It also means what little of the story there is can at least be appreciated, although it's 99% farce.So it all comes down to the jokes themselves. Some miss but there are a lot of gags and most of them hit. I was laughing out loud for a lot of the movie. Much of the formula is simple but very effective. Take an aspect of a normal situation. Gradually make it a little sillier, but where it's still plausible. And then smoothly transition into a more ridiculous situation until it makes no sense at all, but treat it all seriously. For example, troops training outside are first doing push-ups and star-jumps and after a few cuts and slightly weirder activities, they're doing a kicking line. It makes no sense, but it's funny. Because it's predictable but also can sometimes be subtle, that makes it even funnier.Many of the gags are also clever, even while being stupid. For instance, characters going outside a jet to fix it while it's flying. Or unconventional manoeuvres to defeat enemy fighter jets. It all breaks the laws of physics but it's only slightly more zany than a lot of real action movies. You realise the filmmakers had a lot of imagination to think of such things. And on the surface, it seems plausible that such things could be done, especially from a kid's point of view. The rules have a kind of logic to them.Another important aspect is the tone. This movie is fun. It isn't trying too hard, nor is it a bunch of lazy unconnected jokes strung together. The people who made it tried to get the most out of every idea and they had some very funny ideas, even if others fall flat. It isn't mean-spirited, it makes fun of all kinds of people and situations in light-hearted ways. It also has some action, singing, romance and sexy moments to make it more entertaining.I haven't seen Top Gun in a long time but I found it to be pretty bland and dated. Hot Shots! Seems to match it in costumes, acting, plot, etc., but doesn't take itself seriously at all. It mocks all kinds of movies in immature ways but it does it well. Especially if you're a film buff it becomes all the funnier because you know what they're making fun of and begin realise more than usual how silly so many other movies actually are. It's one of the better spoof movies out there, a genre with a lot of garbage unfortunately.",Hot Shots!
64,huggibear,This movie is just plain silly! 6 Stars from me!,6,22 July 2017,"I don't dislike it, but it's not watchable more than once. It was pretty funny, in a slapstick kind of way. I've never seen more ejections from a fighter aircraft though and one scene 'in the air' on this movie was just way too unbelievable. I'd agree with the other reviewer that it does come close to 'Airplane', even though I have yet to see that movie. I just believe I know that movie is going to be quite similar to this one and I can't wait to see it some day. However, if I'm going to watch a comedy, I prefer humor like John Candy, Steve Martin, some of Steve Carell's less serious roles, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson. I can't think of any other funnier people right now, so if you want to add to this, go ahead and reply because I'm also open to knowing who the heck else is funny in movies these days or from way, way back in the days. I'd love to hear from you.",Hot Shots!
65,Semisonic,Not as funny as the old memories tell,5,19 July 2015,"Some 20 years ago, when i was a kid, i saw this film with an amateur single-voice Russian dub of horrible quality. I haven't yet got to see Top Gun or Dances with Wolves back then, so i simply took this film at face value. And... it felt really funny! I mean, all those gags and silly slapstick humor hit right through without any second thought.Yesterday i decided to take a walk down memory lane and re-watched it. Well, i have to say it wasn't such a good idea, because over the years i've come to expect a subtler, higher quality humor from the comedies, and the never-ending sequence of jokes or moments that were supposed to be funny no matter what grew old and tiresome rather fast. I mean, it's still a rather decent mockery of Top Gun since it clearly reveals the cheapness of the pathos that film boasted. But when Hot Shots! tried to do anything of its own, it felt pretty dumbed down and cheap itself.Apparently i'm a minority here because most people on the movie's board seem to have a pretty high esteem of it. But, while i understand why someone would enjoy Hot Shots!, it's important to state that there's nothing wrong or weird in having a less impressed view on it. After all, even comedies can be made for different tastes, and Hot Shots! is clearly more of a fast food sort of cinema than an haute cuisine type of it.",Hot Shots!
66,dkncd,"Not on par with ""Airplane!"" or the ""Naked Gun"" films, but has its moments",6,29 August 2007,"""Hot Shots!"" is a comedy that parodies a number of films, particularly ""Top Gun"" (1986). The cast is led by Charlie Sheen, who is an appropriate choice for the role of Lieutenant Topper Harley. Also notable is Cary Elwes as Topper's dashing flight school rival, Valeria Golino as Topper's love interest and Lloyd Bridges as the flight school's commander Lloyd Bridges' performance is not as funny as his role in ""Airplaine!"" (1980), but he has funny lines and scenes in this film.The film's comedy is a mix of slapstick humor, quips and satires of other movies. The film has great scenes, such as ""Dead Meat's"" pre-flight musings and quotes such as ""Bogie at 12:00"". I enjoyed how this film parodied the juvenile pilot rivalry and the legacy of the main character's father haunting him from ""Top Gun"" (1986). I also found most of the jokes based on ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) amusing. However, a number of the movie parodies are extremely random and seem out of place and make the film feel disjointed at times, such as the reference to ""Marathon Man"" (1976). The film has a number of amusing moments, but the film's comedy is generally not on the level of the ""Naked Gun"" movies or ""Airplane!"" (1980) which are more focused comedy films in a similar vein and both also contain writing from Jim Abrahams.",Hot Shots!

It's a spoof of Top Gun, and they get everything right.The cast is the best: Charlie Sheen, Cary Elwes, Valeria Golino, Lloyd Bridges, Bill Irwin, and more. There's no use trying to describe the movie's plot or run through the jokes. If you haven't seen ""Hot Shots!,"" go see it now. If you have seen it, it's time to see it again.

The special effects are very ingenious as well and it's often pretty difficult to tell what's real and what's a model.Lloyd Bridges, though, is the standout here; he's just so outrageously funny and certainly gets the best lines.

It could have been better, but it is good. The more you watch it, the more you will see any details that you have not seen before. So you watch this film over and over again.

Every one was great at what they were doing, no matter character or actor. But the flowers are for the great late Lloyd Bridges, he's the best of the best on this film. Admiral Benson was more a mannequin than a man. It's amazing that that man got to be the US president in the sequel. Or maybe not. Anyway this is THE comedy, when it comes to laughs you can't stop.

76,phantopp,Not as funny as the sequel,4,22 October 2008,"Former US Navy fighter pilot ""Topper Harley"" (Charlie Sheen) is called back to duty, and he reluctantly agrees despite personal demons he has suffered since a freak accident that killed his father, ""Buzz Harley"" (Bill Irwin).While preparing for his mission, ""Harley"" meets a lovely psychiatrist named ""Ramada"" (Valeria Golino), and begins to pursue her. The two eventually get together, despite her being involved with ""Harley's"" fellow squadron member, ""Lt. Kent Gregory"" (Cary Elwes), who lost his father in the same incident that ""Harley"" lost his.As the squadron prepares for their mission, the mission is being sabotaged by an aerospace firm's representatives who are there to allegedly supervise the mission.Let me say first that, in my opinion, the second movie in this franchise is a lot funnier. Like the second movie, this one is full of jokes that just keep flying at you, but I noticed that I wasn't laughing at much as I was when I saw the second one awhile ago.I really didn't feel great chemistry between the cast, and only a little chemistry between the focus of the movie, Golino and Sheen. I felt that the focus was put on the various jokes more than anything else.Like I said earlier, this movie is packed full of sight gags, jokes and just about any other kind of joke there is. However, unlike the second movie, I only had some chuckles and mild laughing outbursts. I don't know if it was because I was still waking up since I watched this movie at 7:30 in the morning, or the jokes weren't all good to produce a good laugh.The special effects in this film was only slightly fair. It was quite obvious that models were used in the air battles. Even sounds added in for comedic effect were obviously added in during post production.The cast itself, despite what little chemistry there was between them, was really good when it came to the comedy. How anybody could act so serious when the jokes are happening around is beyond me. I would get so distracted when I start to see something meant as a joke, I would start cracking up.One standout performance was from the late Lloyd Bridges, who has done similar movies in his career. He easily has one of the wackiest characters in the entire movie, but his performance is done so seriously that it's easily one of the most memorable in this movie.I was not too impressed with the soundtrack. A couple of songs were used for comedic purposes that produced a chuckle, but I can't really recall more than one song in the the entire movie.One thing the writers forgot was the subplot of the aerospace firm that wants to replace the current jet fighters with German-made ones. Yes, there are a few scenes to advance the plot, but not enough for it to mean anything at its climax. In fact, it is put so far on the backburner as the ""Harley""/""Ramada"" love story is being developed, I completely forgot about it.I would say that you should wait until you find this one on television, or the Free Movies section of your On Demand service. I can only recommend this one if there is nothing else on television.",Hot Shots!

You feel like you're watching a movie, instead of a string of stupid ""hey this is from this movie"", ""hey that's from that movie"" scenes strung together.Lloyd Bridges is fantastic as the clueless admiral, Carey Elwes plays one of the most egotistical jerks I've seen, and Charley Sheen's comic timing with his lines really bring this one together.The other great part is you don't even have to have seen the movies its spoofing to understand what's going on or to laugh at the jokes.

This is from the time when spoof movies were really FUNNY and not disasters of scripting and direction, relying purely on visual gags. This one has a story that is expectedly thin ( but consistent) and characters that shine -and none so more than the wonderful Lloyd Bridges as Admiral Benson. He is pricelessly funny every second he is on screen with such intense deadpan delivery that one cannot help laughing, even before he opens his mouth. Characters who are so mad and bizarre are always fascinating, but especially so when figures of authority and power are portrayed, and a great actor inhabits the role. The two leads play tongue in cheek performances with the proper seriousness, and the supporting cast is a mixed bag. There are some great visual gags and also many movie references, which is always part of the fun of this type of movie. I have to also say the flying scenes were excellent.",Hot Shots!
80,TravS94,Hot Shots!,9,10 August 2013,"PLOT: A group of air force pilots must go on a top secret mission with the help of the newly brought on Topper Harley (played by Charlie Sheen). MY THOUGHTS: I love spoof movies. They are very hilarious if done right. The older ones such as the Naked Gun, Airplane, and any of the Mel Brooks films are just delightful to watch. This one is no different. I find this movie very funny and it pulls out all the stops to make you laugh. Being that it is older, many jokes aren't as raunchy as today's standards, but it doesn't have to be. Many jokes in this movie are more dry or just plain ridiculous, but it makes you howl with laughter none the less. PROS/CONS: This film is hilarious from start to finish. No joke is weak and causes the film to lag in any area of the picture. Very few comedies can keep you laughing completely throughout it and this one definitely does. Very funny no matter how much I watch it.OVERALL: 9/10",Hot Shots!

You gotta' laugh through out it and if you don't then you can at least have the satisfaction of laughing at it! -Enjoy it folks!,Hot Shots!
87,lion-17,bad,5,2 February 1999,Hot shots is not worth watching.Some parts are funny but most parts are made by a 8 year old infant; the part with Superman and the ambulance f.e. makes you think you're watching a kids-movie.,Hot Shots!
88,jkuhne,Airplane caliber,10,23 May 2001,"I didn't appreciate this movie the first time I saw it.  The second time I loved it--and it's only gotten better over time.  This movie is so chock full of memorable funny quotes it ranks up with the old Mel Brooks films, Python, and Airplane.Lloyd Bridges is simply hilarious as the senile naval commander.  His role in this movie and it's sequel is one of my all time favorites.",Hot Shots!
89,djmullen,"Wisconsin and Minnesota references in ""Hot Shots!""",9,6 February 2005,"Jim Abrahams is from Shorewood, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb. He went to college at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Many local references are slipped into Hot Shots:The ""Indian"" language dialogs with chief ""Owatonna"" include these words:Owatonna - a city in Minnesota. Minnetonka - a city in Minnesota.Ojibwa - also known as Chippewa. A Great Lakes area Indian tribe.Nakomas - a Chippewa word meaning ""I do as I promised"". ""Nakoma"" is a neighborhood in Madison. Shakopee - a city in Minnesota. Itasca - a county in Minnesota (and a city in Illinois.)Minocqua - a city in northern Wisconsin. Minnehaha - ""Laughing Waters"" from Longfellow's poem, ""Song of Hiawatha"". There are Minnehaha's all over Minnesota and Wisconsin. Mendota - a city next to Madison, Wi.Mannetowish - a city in Northern Wi. Wauwatosa - a suburb of Milwaukee.Winnebago - a Wisconsin Indian tribe.In the barracks, when Wash Out admits he inadvertently ate Kent's father (but didn't have seconds), several people turn out to be connected to Eagle River, a town in Wisconsin (and Alaska, Michigan, British Columbia, Colorado and who knows where else.)And finally, the hero's name is Topper Harley. Harley-Davidson motorcycles are made in Milwaukee and Harley made a scooter named the Topper in the early sixties.",Hot Shots!
90,rickroth81,Goofy fun for those who enjoy laughing,8,4 May 2006,"Very silly and very absurd but very hilarious parody film. What makes this goofy movie so entertaining is that the actors take the zany roles very seriously, thus making the film so much funnier. Quite a few spoofs, ranging from top gun, full metal jacket, dances with wolves (hahaha), gone with the wind, superman, and with numerous allusions to many other films, you don't need to see those films to enjoy hot shots. charlie sheen is never funnier and lloyd bridges is so hilarious hahaha!! (a bazooka round at little big horn... or was it okinawa? hahahaha) the film is so full of goofy sight and sound gags and silly dialogue if you blink you will miss something, its that type of film, much akin to airplane or naked gun movies. there is a plot but its not terribly important. the supporting cast is just perfect, no dull characters. warning: if you are a dedicated member of the united states air force there is a high likelihood you will be offended by this film's satirization.",Hot Shots!
91,philtbautista,Fun to Make - Great Cast and Crew,10,20 June 2017,"After finishing up a gig on the Space Shuttle in Houston, I called Billy (Aerial Unit) and he says ""We can use a guy your size, come on out!"". So I was an extra: A Carrier Deck Hand, Iraqi Soldier, they guy who holds up the weight sign to the pilot, etc. Then one day Matthew the 2nd AD is looking for Charlie to set up a scene and says ""Go tell Wardrobe to put you in Charlie's dress white's and get out here, we gotta set up this scene and Charlie's shooting another scene right now"". So I did, and then became his Stand-In from there.Got to meet some of the great actors like Lloyd Bridges & Ephraim Zimbalist Jr. before they both passed on, Charlie Sheen (of course) and John Cryer. I picked John up in my old yellow Cadillac Sedan one day while he was walking across the set in the rain. Told him to sit in the back ""Limo"" style! All were very nice to me, and very humble.Back at Bill's (Badalato - EXP) house while he is cooking pasta for me and his son Billy (Aerial) I look on the table and there is a small leather bound photo album with the smallest gold letters that say ""Top Gun"". I look through it and there are all these Polaroids of the cast and crew in goofy poses on the set of Top Gun. Nothing big, nothing fancy, just your ""typical"" photo album sitting on the coffee table! Such great and humble Men and Women, from Bill, Billy, Doc, Richard, Lloyd, Charlie, John, Christie and Valeria et al. In fact, Billy had me shoot a spoof of Bill's (nonexistent) ""Ego"" where the cast all played along in the video. Went to Lloyd Bridges home and shot a very dramatic clip of Lloyd talking about Bill and his devotion to family (meaning also his ""Film Family""). Charlie joked (in his clip) that Bill was so uptight and difficult to work with and that Bill (who is bald) had ""hair"" at the start of the picture! All great people! And I got to flirt with Valeria while we were eating a couple of times since I spoke a little Italian :-) Phil Bautista, Austin TX",Hot Shots!
92,siavoshkasravi,Love it,10,14 March 2020,One of the most amusing and fun movies even today if you feel it. Best parody of Top Gun and some other movies. Best music ever. I got the OST and play it all the time and always remember the movie scenes. And not to forget lovely actress Valeria Golino.So many delicate anecdotes and events. You cannot catch them all by watching the movie one time.,Hot Shots!
93,EnochF,The Last Great Zucker Movie,9,21 October 1999,"Back in 1991 a friend of mine celebrated her birthday by inviting all her friends out to see this movie. Good choice. Admittedly, it's not quite as funny as Airplane! But it's easily the equal of Top Secret! To me, Hot Shots! was the last great Zucker movie. Everything since has been so-so. Whether it's looking at Charlie Sheen through a fisheye lens or listening to lines like ""I've fallen for you like a blind roofer,"" this is an all-out funny movie. It's not perfect, but for every one-liner that fails, there's eight more that really work. The sight gags don't score as high: too much reliance on movie parodies, the same thing that made the Naked Gun sequels so formulaic. But whenever Hot Shots! remembers it's a parody of Top Gun, it's great.",Hot Shots!
94,bubina,Hot Shots is not funny at all,1,19 October 1999,"Newspapers said: Hot Shots is the mother of all films. I saw it and tried my best to laugh - but it was not funny at all. I was bored all the time. If this film really was the mother of all films than the film industry can say good night and stop producing. I usually like comedies and to have a good laugh in films, even if it is a serious one, but this film disapointed me so much I can hardly explain. Maybe it is not my kind of humor. I know, many others like this movie, but sorry, I can not find it funny at all.",Hot Shots!
95,KingOfDistaste,The Real ZAZ,9,9 April 2004,"I grew up watching this movie over and over and over and over again. Later I'd watch the Naked Gun Trilogy and then Airplane.  As I grew older still, I'd allways pay homoge to the minds who brought us such films, and violently cursed out today's corny comedies such as The New Guy.  ""Why can't there great comedies like HOTSHOTS, Airplane, the Naked Guns!?"" I'd say. ""That's real comedy!""Then one day I found out that those movies, including Kentucky Fried Movie and TOP SECRET were by the same men, in different multiples:  David Zucker, Jim Abrahams & Jerry Zucker... my idols.  It's becuase of those men and films that I've found where I belong in life.  Laughing.  If it wasn't for that, I'd probably be some fat piece of SHlT little emo kid, and for that I thank Zucker Abrahams & Zucker from the top of my heart.  More than Jesus.",Hot Shots!
96,psdook,about as funny as a fighter jet crash,2,23 July 2017,"The perennial love for this film is a little strange, to put it lightly. The humour in the dialogue was tired and predictable and the visual jokes were few and far between. Were there characters? Didn't feel like it. And why on Earth are people comparing this to such classics as Airplane and the Naked Gun??? Not even the action saved it - 95% of the run-time was taken up by dire chat about tactics and characters reminiscing about their dreary lives.Yawn",Hot Shots!
97,lhruud,Top Gun will never be the same!,8,26 September 2005,"A great comedy, indeed - but some scenes are funnier than other. I regard the piano scene in the first part of the movie as one of the best parodies I've seen! And that's not only because the Gershwin tune is better music than ""Makin' Whopee""... - Valeria Golino shows comedy of top class doing this hilarious remake of Suzie Diamond.Lloyd Bridges also brings several funny moments into the movie. Nearly 80 years old when the movie was made, he shows that age means only a little compared with skill and experience.Finally, one may wonder why every successful comedy has to be followed by a sequel that hardly makes you laughing...",Hot Shots!
98,no-406,Memories...,10,12 February 2006,"It's 2006 and I still believe this is one of the best parodies of all times, worth to include next to Spaceballs, Naked Gun and Scary Movie (all 3 of them).From time to time I like watching such movies, since I'm sick and tired of all the modern ""shoot 'em up"" or ""philosophy for n00bs"" type of films. It's relaxing and a good laugh always makes you forget about everything else.Now that was besides the point. Getting back to ""Hot Shots"", I can say only one thing - excellent. And to be honest, every movie that starred Charlie Sheen I've seen since was dull. Maybe it's a little unfair to remember Charlie Sheen only for this role (he's a very good actor), but he was so...funny in it that I can't help it. The movie itself is very well glued together, the scenes are dubbed with the perfect soundtrack to make you laugh 'till you fall off your chair and the comedy techniques are (as somebody said before me) classic - no fart/burp jokes or toilet humor.Overall, I'd watch it anytime.",Hot Shots!
