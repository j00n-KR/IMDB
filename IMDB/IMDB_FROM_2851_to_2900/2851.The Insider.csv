0,MartinHafer,Well made but where is the surprise?!,7,10 March 2014,"""The Insider"" details the back story about a segment that ""60 Minutes"" aired back in the early 1990s. A fired vice president of the Brown and Williamson tobacco company talked with CBS--even though he was forbidden by a confidentiality agreement to talk about the company to anyone. His conscience was bothered by some of the unscrupulous and dangerous things the cigarette industry was covertly doing that made cigarettes even more dangerous. The film stars several Hollywood heavyweights--Al Pacino (the head of ""60 Minutes, Russell Crowe (the whistle-blower) and Christopher Plummer (as Mike Wallace) and is a rather straight forward version of the story.I agree with most of the reviews--""The Insider"" is a very well-crafted film. However, it's also a case where the story, no matter how well made, is seriously flawed--at least to me. The theme of the film is how evil the tobacco companies are and how they knew that they were killing folks with their product. And, how this industry did its best to stop this story from being released by ""60 Minutes"". This is about as surprising as learning that pirates love booty, Nazis are evil or crack addicts love crack. Where is the story and where is the surprise?! Of course tobacco companies have been minimizing and denying that tobacco kills...DUH!!! They sell a product that kills people and they've been making it seem fun and glamorous for as long as they've been selling the product!! To me it's a no-brainer and frankly not that interesting. Plus, anyone who does choose to smoke is amazingly stupid--as we've known that cigarettes kill for many decades. So, while I respect the film for its quality, the story did nothing for me.",The Insider
1,Leofwine_draca,"Good, but not great...",6,6 January 2020,"Other reviewers have commented how ""intense"" they found this slow-burning true-life thriller but I must have watched a different movie. Michael Mann's THE INSIDER is technically superior, similar to HEAT, but it's also rather cold and clinical which leaves you detached from the main action. It's also rather overlong and drawn out, telling a story which could have been more effective with an hour knocked off (not that I'm adverse to longer movies; I think THE IRISHMAN was just the right length). It's essentially an actor's showcase with Al Pacino and Russell Crowe fighting a lot, so it's entertaining in that respect, but I was expecting something more...",The Insider
2,SnoopyStyle,Crowe revelation,8,14 February 2015,Intrepid '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) gets Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) an interview with Hezbollah. He wants to do a story about cigarettes accidentally setting fires and receives a stack of technical documents. He seeks out Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) to translate the jargon. Wigand just got fired from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. His daughter suffers and he needs the medical coverage in his severance package. The company is playing hardball with his confidentiality agreement. The pressure is overwhelming and from all sides.This is a terrific Michael Mann movie. The story doesn't have natural kinetic energy. However he creates such tension from the story. Al Pacino gives his usual power acting. Russell Crowe is a revelation as a haggard middle-aged family man. The subject matter could easily drown in white collar gobbergoob talk. However Mann makes it a great character study and an energized thriller.,The Insider
3,Hitchcoc,Tense from Beginning to End!,10,19 January 2010,"I am often suspicious of docudramas because sometimes they take so many liberties with facts or revamp and combine events for their own purposes. Oliver Stone is frequently guilty of this. This film portrays an event that I remember like it was yesterday. The subtle portrayal of a man who must face the horrors of our modern age, disgrace, divorce, dishonor, and lack of health insurance, is right on and Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are incredible in their roles. It becomes a battle between the integrity of modern journalism, the entrenched tobacco industry, and whether one man can change anything. It is believable because this is the way it happened. There are even disclaimers at the end dealing with a couple of shady issues. I was also incredibly impressed by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Except for the voice, I almost felt he was there. I didn't even remember this film existed until I saw it recommended in a ""best of"" list. I'm so happy I got to see something that really is for an adult viewer, not unlike ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Keep these kinds of things coming.",The Insider
4,Horst_In_Translation,Interesting drama based on real events with a decent amount of depth,6,18 September 2020,"""The Insider"" is an American, mostly English-language movie from 1999, so this one had its 20th anniversary last year. The director is Michael Mann and he is also one of the writers credited here. The other man in charge of the screenplay was Eric Roth and this is not the only occasion that these two have collaborated. Roth is even an Oscar winner for ""Forrest Gump"", an achievement that Mann has not managed yet although he is certainly the most known crew member attached to this project. Marie Brenner also needs to be mentioned here as she is the one who was in charge of the article this film is based on. You don't see it too often that films are based on articles, but Brenner is a bit of an expert there. And now, two decades later, she was connected to the new Oscar-nominated Clint Eastwood movie ""Richard Jewell"" too. Long career, props to her. Back to this one here. By the way, don't mistake it for a black-and-white movie because of the poster here on imdb. As you would expect from a film from the year 1999, this is a color movie. And a pretty long one at that with comfortably over 2.5 hours. Still, it is by no means Mann's longest film. One that is longer is ""Heat"", a movie he made briefly before this one and that one is probably even more famous than this one here. There are some differences and parallels between these films. Both have Pacino and in both films he is the good guy. While ""Heat"" is a story of antagonists, this one here is a tale of cooperators. I would not really call them friends.Also Mann has a tendency to include males at the center of his films, not females. There are females, but usually they do not get beyond the romantic partner part and this film is no exception. The men are in control (or hope they are) in Michael Mann's films. Very fitting last name too for this approach. The other lead actor in here, the one on the bottom of the poster, is Russell Crowe. He was in his mid30s here when this was made and not a big star yet. This changed quickly, however, as he managed an Oscar nomination for his portrayal here and it was the first of three Oscar nominations for him (and countless other awards and nominations) within a short period of time. He soon turned into Australia's biggest Hollywood actor and he sure still has a shot nowadays to fit this description, even if many may argue for Jackman instead. Oh wait, Crowe is from New Zealand I see? My bad then. Not much of a contest there I suppose. Anyway, I like Crowe and definitely need to catch up on some of his older (and newer) projects. But I must still say that Al Pacino (who just turned 80) has risen considerably in the ranking of my favorites over the last five or ten years and no hesitation for me in saying he gave the best performance in this movie, maybe is even the best thing about the movie. Sadly, his turn pretty much got ignored completely by awards bodies. Massive disapproval from me here. And massive approval for his turn. He is this good really.The two also do not have as many scenes together as you could imagine. There is a bit of a clean structure in here. The parts early on are about them meeting and cooperating, but then, even if still in touch, their shared screen time becomes considerably less and we see either fighting his own fight and demons. Crowe's character has mostly to deal with the consequences that the interview has on his family and how his life is so deteriorating from it that his wife decides to break up. Also the ways in which we see his powerful former employer still have a massive impact on his life are crucial here. There's cars following him and of course the bullet scene in the mailbox as well as the computer virus are easy to remember. I must say I found the bullet scene a bit exaggerated, but apparently from what the closing credits imply, it actually happened like this, so I have to correct myself and I am really fine with it. And as for Pacino's character, he is mostly fighting with his broadcaster and against the decision to remove the interview from the show because it could result in serious consequences for the channel. There are references about his family too, but they are considerably smaller than those linked to Crowe's character.Here and there, I had to think of Matt Damon's ""The Informant!"" (from ten years later) while watching this movie, even if I preferred Damon's turn over Crowe's. Maybe my favorite Damon performance ever. So it means something. And a bit also of ""Frost/Nixon"" in terms of tone and atmosphere at least and of course the media element, even if the two main characters in that film are also opponents and the ones in this one we have here are not. It is a pretty long film as I said earlier, but I don't think it dragged too much. There were certainly scenes that could have been left out and it would not have hurt the film, maybe even helped it, but yeah, it is all tolerable and quite an achievement to come up with a film like this that does not drag too much despite the running time. It does not fly by either unfortunately as you can see from my rating, but there are maybe two or three great moments nonetheless. The scene with Crowe's character getting the phone call by Pacino's character telling him that they will not release the interview is heartbreaking to watch kinda. We know the protagonist had lost everything at that point already. He sacrificed his marriage, his job and his reputation too for justice to come into effect and there it seems as if it is not going to happen. But there is a twist and a happy ending too you could say and you see that if television channels won't pull through with the truth, there is still newspapers coming up with the pressure. Here it is the New York Times eventually helping the interview to get published. This makes Pacino's character really happy. Well, what can you say about the man. He is tremendous. Especially his monologues and speeches to other characters are always as good as it gets and probably nobody is better when it comes to those, not just in this film, but also in general.Comedy is rare in this film because Crowe's character is the opposite of a joker and Pacino's also not too much, but the ""Alice in Wonderland"" quote was fun on one occasion. What else can I say here? This film was very successful with awards bodies back then. Look at all the Oscar nominations (including for Best Director and Best Picture), even if it did not win a single one of them. But yeah, like I said: It's difficult for me anyway to accept those with Pacino getting so critically snubbed. Also about this film, a bit unusual that both protagonists were not only still alive back in 1999 when this film got made, but are both still alive today and hopefully also still when you read this review a couple years from now. Interestingly enough, they are both almost the exact same age while Crowe is considerably younger here than Pacino, almost 25 years in fact, even if Pacino looks younger than late 50s for sure too. Oh yes, the tobacco industry is crucial in here too because this field of profession is Crowe's character's background. And I spoke about comedy earlier, but it is also pretty funny in a bittersweet way how the tobacco industry/companies really managed to do away with all the responsibility and blame their buyers instead for all that happened to them because of cigarette consumption. But yeah, now in 2020, cigarettes are really far from being as edgy and cool as they were ten years ago, let alone 20 years ago. People tend to wake up. I mentioned the two leads a lot, but really everybody from the cast deserves a thumbs-up. Extremely strong ensemble performance and maybe this would have been a deserved Oscar had such a category been in existence then. It's not even now in 2020. Christopher Plummer, the epitome of the amazing Hollywood supporting actor, once again shows us his class. He also has a few really good, sometimes even funny, moments and I am glad he is in here. Slightly less impactful is Philip Baker Hall, an actor who is always easy to identify, but with whom you do not always remember the name. Plummer and Baker Hall are both around the age of 90 now and still alive. Hopefully for a while.The legal references I also found interesting in this film. How being in another state kept Crowe's character from being prosecuted, but how the ""third-party law"" (you know what I mean) posed a crucial danger to his interview and the future of one of America's biggest broadcasting stations. So yeah, overall no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up. It's a pretty strong David vs. Goliath story with major focus on scandal, the tobacco industry and, most of all, the press. If these are subjects that you do not despise in films, it's time to check this one out. It's a good film I'd say, maybe even still a bit on the underseen side, probably because it is very bleak from beginning to end and there are hardly any exceptions. Also what makes the entire thing even more meaningful is that it is based on actual characters and a story that at least loosely happened the way it is depicted here. Sometimes reality comes up with the most thrilling tales. Okay, maybe ""thrilling"" is not the right word to describe this film, but you know what I mean. ""Important"" could be it. So yeah, go for it, especially if you like Crowe and Pacino as much as I do. Or some of the supporting players. Torn and Crouse I have not mentioned yet and both have small parts. More familiar faces for sure. Positive recommendation, even if I must say that sadly it did not get me curious to read about how the entire situation really unfolded back then!",The Insider
5,classicsoncall,"""We're in the nicotine delivery business.""",8,16 April 2018,"When Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) made the statement above in a sworn deposition, it changed the tenor of the story for me. Everyone knows that smoking cigarettes is bad for you, but when the damage caused by smoking is exacerbated by chemically treated additives designed to affect the brain and central nervous system so that users become addicted, well that adds a whole new dynamic to this story of corporate complicity to prevent the truth from reaching the American public. I wasn't following this news event all that closely when it broke, but one didn't have to because most of the glaring headlines told the story. I do remember the bit about the 'nicotine delivery business' and it had the effect of sending chills up your spine when associated with the 'ammonia chemistry' Wigand also spoke about. For me, this film played out almost like an espionage thriller. You had the upper levels of corporate and media hierarchy entangled in a sophisticated legal dance designed to keep the truth from coming out. One has to credit the real Dr. Wigand for the courage and fortitude required to withstand the daily onslaught against his character and integrity. Russell Crowe turns in a skillfully conflicted performance of a family man on the brink of having his entire world collapse while trying to do the right thing. Al Pacino may be better known for other roles but he was never finer than he was here as firebrand CBS producer Lowell Bergman, carrying his loyalty and integrity right to the very edge with his company and on-air personality Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). The only part of the script I didn't agree with was when Crowe's character is described by Bergman as being an ordinary person under extraordinary pressure for telling the truth. No matter how you slice it, Wigand was no ordinary person to put up with a divorce, the breakup of his family, and personal character assassination in order to out the tobacco companies. It takes a certain kind of individual in the face of overwhelming opposition to become, in a paraphrase of an earlier comment, a truth delivery system.",The Insider
6,gavin6942,An Example for Future Films,9,21 July 2006,"This film, like ""Good Night and Good Luck"", sends a clear message to me and hopefully to movie makers everywhere: we need more movies highlighting social and political issues, and we need more media outlets with some integrity.This film, directed by Michael Mann (""Miami Vice""), has given me a new respect for Mann and also for Russell Crowe, who I thought was not good for much besides getting sweaty and punching people. Crowe is a winner here, and alongside Al Pacino (who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned) we have a dynamic duo on par with Batman and Robin.The story is of a tobacco executive (Crowe) who turns against his former employer with the help of a media producer (Pacino). With lawsuits a death threats the tobacco industry tries to stop them. I was not sure how the film was going to end because it keeps twisting and turning and although the true story did not happen long ago it was not one I was familiar with.I'm not going to critique the music or the directing or the acting or any other aspect of this film, other than to say it was excellent. The film was a bit on the long side, but this was not a bad quality in any way. I never felt a scene was wasted and the pacing was good enough to keep me engrossed. I admit I should have been sleeping for work but this movie held me to my screen.The Pepsi girl was in this film... who is almost as creepy as the Welch's grape juice girl. I don't know why I feel the need to mention that, but I do. Someday when I can't remember those commercials any more I will probably appreciate this actress more.Anyway, great film. See it.",The Insider
7,lee_eisenberg,Smoke 'em out,8,23 January 2007,"I still remember when ""60 Minutes"" interviewed Jeffrey Wigand, and I thought that Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" did a swell job telling the story. I'm not a bit surprised that the tobacco industry did what they did. According to what I read, General Motors tried to stop ""Roger and Me"" from getting released, so it should be no shock that Brown & Williamson tried to go after Jeffrey Wigand and ""60 Minutes"".I recall that Russell Crowe had to gain a lot of weight for his role as Wigand, only to lose it to play Maximus in ""Gladiator"". I guess that it's debatable whether or not Al Pacino eclipses him as producer Lowell Bergman, but both men do very well in their roles. I agree with a previous reviewer that Crowe's role here deserves more recognition (maybe even more than ""Gladiator"").Anyway, this is a very important movie. It just goes to show what these corporate industries are really all about. Once again, Mann shows himself to be a capable director, as he did with ""The Keep"", ""Heat"" and ""Ali"".Also starring Christopher Plummer, Lindsay Crouse, Philip Baker Hall and Gina Gershon.",The Insider
8,ccthemovieman-1,Just Great Film-making......Period,10,24 February 2006,"Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception. Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a ""60 Minutes"" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer ""Lowell Bergman,"" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist ""Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,"" and Christopher Plummer as ""Mike Wallace"" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It's simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann's ""Heat,"" except without the violence.The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that's not surprising being it's about ""60 Minutes."" I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making. What else can you say?",The Insider
9,rmax304823,Warning: Movie May Cause Boredom,2,18 September 2002,"Whether the defendant is a squealer or a whistle blower depends on which side of the social border the judge sits on. If the informant betrays secrets about an organization we support, then he's a squealer or a spy. If we hate the organization, then he's a civic-minded whistle blower. It's kind of like being a ""terrorist"" or a ""freedom fighter.""In this case, there's no doubt that Jeffrey Wigand was a flawed but full-blown whistler. He tattled on ""Big Tobacco,"" as it's consistently called, a conspiratorial corporate entity everyone hates. What did he have to gain? Not much. He admits to having a bad temper and feels he was fired ""for no good reason,"" but for most of us that would be a weak motive for risking your bountiful severance package and your family. (Of course, who knows what's in a man's heart?) There are death threats that show up on his PC and a bullet appears in his mailbox, or so we are told. People may be ""surveilling"" him at places like a golf driving range. If so, the surveillers are pretty obvious about it. Writers, and viewers as well, need to be careful with this kind of material. After he was sent to jail, G. Gordon Liddy, a paranoid if there ever was one, describes in his book, ""Will,"" how he made killer enemies in prison and concluded that on a given night they were going to make an attempt on his life. He chose bravely to sleep out in the open with a blunt object for defense nearby. Nobody showed up that night. He believes his audacity frightened the killers off, whereas most reasonable readers would suspect that his enemies, like Son of Sam's social life, were all in his head. At any rate, as it turns out, Wigand loses just about everything dear to him.Another brave whistle blower is Lowell Bergman the CBS producer who brings the whole tawdry story to light by blowing the whistle on CBS to the New York Times. He quits his job. (The movie makes it appear that he quits immediately after his victory, whereas in fact he didn't quit until two years later.) The movie is based on Bergman's version of events.The question is: aside from making us feel good because, by means of all this sacrifice Big Tobacco gets it in the chin, what other purpose is served? What startling exposition is there in Wigand's suppressed interview? Certainly not that cigarettes are bad for you. The Surgeon General's report demonstrated that in 1964. And even that report was a redundancy since just about everyone, from scientists to morons, knew that cigarettes make you ill. The first use of the term ""coffin nail"" or ""nail in your coffin"" used in reference to cigarettes appeared in 1888, when cigarettes were just beginning to be used in addition to cigars and pipes. Here's a headline from the Chicago Daily Tribune, 15 July 1897, ""Unconscious From Cigaret Smoke: George Decker of Jersey City Succumbs to an Excessive Use of 'Coffin Tacks.'"" (That's from Dictionary of American Regional English.) In Chinese, the character representing ""tobacco"" is the same as that for ""opium,"" a stylized picture of a man imprisoned by four walls.There is an interesting datum on how ammonia compounds are added to tobacco to facilitate the impact of nicotine -- but that's the whole point of smoking. No one ever claimed that cigarettes TASTED good. Enhancing the impact of nicotine is an example of good old American know-how.At least from what we can see, the two main contributions of the controversial interview are (1) that the CEOs lied when they testified that they did not believe tobacco was an addictive drug, and (2) sound bites -- ""Cigarettes are nothing more than a delivery system for a drug."" (We hear that last bite quoted 3 times.)Well, Big Tobacco (and little tobacco for that matter, if that term can be applied to users) had already been demonized. The whole affair, in all its complexity, seems to have cemented even more firmly in place those prejudices most viewers will already hold. The film was careful not to indict smokers because, after all, these addicts go to the movies. The film poses as an expose, when in fact it has about the same sensational value as the revelation that Benedict Arnold sold West Point to the British.And who wound up paying for all this? Big Tobacco came under a great deal of expensive litigation, and remains there today. Penalties were levied on the corporations. The corporations passed these additional costs on to the users by tripling and quadrupling the cost of cigarettes. Most of the people who are addicted to cigarettes (we're not talking about the conspicuous consumption of expensive cigars) are working and lower class. The result is a regressive tax, in which the chief burden falls on those least able to pay. Forty years ago, a carton of Camels could be had for 90 cents. Today, in New York, you pay between five and six dollars a pack. That's an increase of roughly 6,111 percent. (I think. If that figure's wrong, it's my calculator's fault.)One might think that, having finally brought the addictive properties of nicotine out into the open, the public and its representatives would feel some sympathy, or even pity, for its victims, but no such sentiment has surfaced. The hatred we feel towards smokers seems boundless and almost gleeful. Here's a poster on the door of a professor of social science in an Eastern university: ""Cancer Cures Smoking,"" in huge blood-red letters. The last time there was such widespread and righteous wrath must have been during the anti-communist fervor of the early 1950s.In return we have the warm self-satisfied glow that comes from knowing that we rooted for the right side in this really rather simple-minded and exploitative movie.",The Insider
10,moonspinner55,"Ambitious, brilliantly-cast recreation of true events...",7,17 December 2010,"Russell Crowe disappears inside the role of Jeffrey Wigand, real-life ex-corporate head for the tobacco giant Brown & Williamson who was fired after opposing the company's ""impact boosting"" of cigarette tobacco (enhancing the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed into the smoker's system) with flagrant disregard for the public's health considerations. Wingard is contacted by ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who convinces Wingard to tell his story to 30 million viewers, this despite legal action and ugly threats from his former employer. Director Michael Mann takes his time setting up this character-driven piece; he's careful to include lots of high drama, though one must wade through many story incidentals to get to the meat of the piece (the television news show caving under pressure from the network's legal advisers, and then admitting their cowardice and doing the right thing). The performances (which really drive the picture) are outstanding. Pacino is able to root out the helplessness of the producer's situation, feeling great empathy for his client but also with the knowledge his own career is on the line. Ethics and morality come in second in this man's circle, and standing up for one's principles is to be labeled a martyr. Christopher Plummer gives an Oscar-worthy performance as ""60 Minutes"" anchor Mike Wallace, and Philip Baker Hall is equally strong as show-creator Don Hewitt. Wallace and Hewitt's loyalty to each other--and how that affects their working relationship with Pacino's Bergman--provides riveting drama, while Crowe's floundering Smoking Gun (one with a hair-trigger temper) is completely realized by the actor.

11,blanche-2,excellent drama,10,4 November 2010,"How far would you go to tell the truth? How far would you go to protect a source? In 99.99% of the cases, the answer is: not very far, not when your job, your family, and your life is on the line.""The Insider"", a 1999 film directed by Michael Mann, dramatizes the true story of two men who stopped at nothing to get out their story - Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) though they are thwarted every time they turn around.Michael Mann assembled a stellar cast - besides Crowe and Pacino, there is Christopher Plummer playing Mike Wallace, Diane Venora as Wigand's wife, Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife, Colm Feore as a Mississippi attorney, Gina Gershon as the CBS attorney, Michael Gambon as Thomas Sandefur, the head of Brown & Williamson Tobacco, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt, and some Broadway people, including Roger Bart and Lynne Thigpen.Jeffrey Wigand was a whistle-blower on his former employer, Brown & Williamson, claiming that the company was aware that nicotine was addictive and was using a carcinogen called coumarin in their cigarettes, though the ""seven dwarfs"" as Wigand called them, the big seven tobacco companies, all had lied in hearings about nicotine being addictive.That's only part of the story. Wigand loses everything in his attempt to tell the truth - he is fired from his job, he has to sell his house, his family is terrorized until his wife and children finally leave him, a smear campaign is started against him, he is slapped with restraining orders, threatened with arrest, his computer is confiscated. And then the worst cut of all - 60 Minutes decides not to air the interview after pressure from the CBS Corporation. Tobacco, it seems, with its billions of dollars, can do whatever it takes to silence someone.Lowell Bergman, realizing that his source has been left out to dry, goes to bat for him in order to get the interview aired, and turns the tables on CBS, risking his own career and relationships with people with whom he has worked for years. He finds out along the way what these people were made of -- not much. In the end, Wallace cares only about his career and legacy, and Don Hewitt bows to CBS. Bergman wins by playing the ultimate hardball and humiliating 60 Minutes.This is a long film but a very gripping story. It takes its time to build instead of rushing the drama without fleshing out the characters. By the end of the film, we know who all of these people are.I remember seeing this in the theater. It was very powerful in 1999, and it's even more powerful today. Why? Because I think there are way fewer Wigands and Bergmans in the world than there were 11 years ago, and it was a dwindling population then - people whose integrity is more important than money.

12,Quinoa1984,Riveting,10,19 March 2000,"Michael Mann's The Insider is a well done drama that looks into whistle blowers and the truth.  The film isn't fast paced or electric, but the way it is put together gets my attention.  The acting, the directing, the photography and the atmosphere bring this film to a fine touch (not to mention 7 Oscar noms).Based on a true story, the film circles on a scientist (played great in an Oscar nominated role by Russel Crowe) who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and a persuasive TV producer (played well by Al Pacino) wants him to tell on his news show 60 Minutes about what effects smoking does to your body. What the film shows is a startling trip in 2 parts- 1: scientist Jeffrey Wigand's trouble with being a whistle blower (he wound up losing everything, but gaining everything); 2: producer Lowell Bergam's struggle to get Wigand's testimony on 60 Minutes without being sued.  And it is well done. Not the best films of the year because of a few flaws, but it is a definite winner.  A+",The Insider

14,sunwarrior13,An Excellent Corporate Thriller,10,30 October 2011,"The Insider is a corporate thriller based on the true story of a 60 Minutes television series segment, as seen through the eyes of a real tobacco executive, Jeffrey Wigand.The 60 Minutes story originally aired in November 1995 in an altered form because of objections by CBS' then- owner, Laurence Tisch, who also controlled Lorillard Tobacco.The story was later aired on February 4, 1996.It stars Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman,Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand, Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace,Bruce McGill as Attorney Ron Motley, Philip Baker Hall as Don Hewitt together with Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Lindsay Crouse, Gina Gershon, Debi Mazar, and Colm Feore. It was adapted by Eric Roth and Michael Mann from the Vanity Fair magazine article ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" by Marie Brenner. The film was also directed by Mann.The Insider tells the true story of a man who decided to tell the world what the seven major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers of their product - the cigarette. Jeffrey Wigand was a scientist employed in research for a tobacco firm, Brown and Williamson. Not long after he was fired by Brown and Williamson,Wigand came into contact with Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes who worked closely with journalist Mike Wallace. Bergman arranged for Wigand to be interviewed by Wallace for a 60 Minutes expose on the cigarette industry, though Wigand was still bound by a confidentiality agreement not to discuss his employment with the company. Despite Wigand's willingness to talk, CBS pulled his interview from at the last minute after Brown and Williamson threatened a multi-billion dollar lawsuit. The staff of 60 Minutes and CBS News were soon embroiled in an internal struggle over the killing of the story,and Wigand found himself the subject of lawsuits and a smear campaign,without his full story reaching the public. This is one great film expose about the truth behind the cigarette,the dangers of smoking in terms of the chemicals behind in the production of the dangerous product and the reason behind why people continue to get addicted to smoking despite the fact of the health hazards behind it.It was more than just a fascinating whistle blower about the ingredients of tobacco.The film also consists of great performance from Pacino,Crowe and Plummer as well as Mann's brilliant direction,despite having no action scenes for which he is known for,that truly makes it a truly great film. Also,the screenplay also made the not-so-interesting story full of suspense and tension.Overall,The Insider is one hell of an excellent film.",The Insider
15,preppy-3,Needs editing--A LOT!!!,5,8 December 1999,"Yeah, it's well acted, yeah it's got an intelligent script but those two elements do NOT make a great movie.  This movie is a (needless) 2 hours and 35 minutes.  There's no suspense (anyone who reads the newspaper or watches TV knows how it's going to end) and we get ENDLESS scenes repeating the same themes (tobacco industry is dangerous; CBS backed out; yadda, yadda, yadda). How this is getting good reviews is beyond me.  I saw it in a packed movie house.  When the film was over a lot of people came out complaining about the length and pointing out how half an hour could have been cut with NO loss to the story!  Director Mann has made great long movies (Heat), but remember this guy is also responsible for real crap (The Keep). Unfortunately this falls somewhere in between.  Wait for the video, so you can fast forward through the boring stuff (about half the movie).",The Insider

He had a story to tell about the addictive properties of tobacco and it was eating at him until he got it out. Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) of CBS News went to bat and did everything in his power to get his story out. He ended up walking away from his job also in the effort. The story made it out and Big Tobacco paid billions in the familiar tobacco settlements. This is the story of the man who brought them down.The acting was brilliant and the directing was masterful. Crowe, director Michael Mann and The Insider were all beat out in the 2000 Academy Awards by American Beauty. What a shame as this was clearly the superior film.",The Insider
17,zardoz-13,Journalistic Integrity Under Fire,10,30 March 2014,"""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann's hard-hitting expose about journalistic integrity in the controversial tobacco lawsuit involving whistle blower Jeffry Wigand is a devastating study about freedom of the press in a capitalistic society. Initially, when I saw ""The Insider"" for the first time, I thought it was going to be strictly about Wigand and the obstacles that he had to overcome to reveal the truth about the tobacco industry. Instead, ""The Insider"" concerns former CBS-TV producer Lowell Bergman's reputation as an honest man. Everything starts out with Bergman receiving a box of documents about the burn rate of cigarettes involved in fires that kill people who go to sleep with lighted cigarettes. Bergman peruses the documents, but he doesn't understand them so he searches for somebody who can explain to him what the documents mean. He crosses paths with a tobacco industry executive, Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe of ""Romper Stomper""), who has just been fired from a company because he suffers a crisis of conscience. Wigand's former employers threaten to cut all his severance package unless he inks more confidential documents. Ultimately, he refuses to concede to Thomas Sandefur's demands. Not only does Wigand lose his comfortable house but also he eventually loses his wife. Meanwhile, Bergman assures Wigand that he has his best interests at heart and he won't betray him. CBS News is set to broadcast a segment on its television magazine news program ""60 Minutes"" with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer of ""Triple Cross"") questioning him about the truth about nicotine and its hazards. The Big Tobacco companies swing into action and feed scandalous material to The Wall Street Journal when they are slapping restraining orders on Wigand. Interestingly enough, the state of Mississippi and Attorney General Mike Moore (Mike Moore) with Richard Scruggs depose Wigand. Just when things are looking good, CBS-TV gets a case of cold feet and runs their story without Wigand's interview. Bergman becomes a whistle blower in his own company and talks to a ""New York Times""newspaper reporter about the scandal while at the same time he convinces ""The Wall Street Journal"" not to publish an expose about Wigand that is made up with half-truths and contradictions. In the end, CBS-TV broadcasts the Wigand interview, but Bergman quits because he knows that he cannot be honest in the future with other prospective news makers. Mann and scenarist Eric Roth deliver both barrels of a double-barreled shotgun indictment that is memorable and damning. The tobacco industry almost got away with scaring not just a whistle blower but also a national news organization. Al Pacino is wonderful as Bergman, and Russell Crowe convinces us that he is the man under the microscope who had everything to lose except his conscientiousness. People who boast about America as a bastion of freedom and journalism as an objective industry free of bias should watch this film and think about what it means. Audiences that crave action and entertainment may find this sizzling expose boring because little in the way of gripping or suspenseful action transpires during its two hour plus running time. Nevertheless, as a whistle blower saga, ""The Insider"" is insightful stuff that should be watched. Mann's film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.",The Insider
18,Boba_Fett1138,The price of being honest.,9,17 October 2005,"This movie tells the intriguing story of mainly two normal individuals and their struggle to unveil the truth behind the lies of the tobacco industry, to the world.Michael Mann movies are often told slowly but they are never boring. This is due to the intensity it is told with, the realistic cinematography by Dante Spinotti and the editing by three different editors. On top of that the two main actors constantly keep the movie in motion. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are both outstanding actors and are truly dynamite in this movie. Both are acting so powerful that they take the movie to an even higher level. Another fine 'villainish' role is played by Michael Gambon and lets please also not forget the wonderful Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace.The way of story telling makes the movie intense and tense at the same time. Only a director like Michael Mann could pull this of. It makes ""The Insider"" truly one of the greatest and most powerful movie of the last couple of years.In my view the movie can be split in two different parts. The first part is about Jeffrey Wigand, his family and the pressure he is put under while the second halve of the picture mainly focuses on Lowell Bergman and his struggle to get the taped interview with Wigand aired on television. The balance between these two parts is perhaps not always perfect and the movie at times focuses a bit too much on Wigand and his family. I know that it is important for the story and the character of Wigand to also tell the story of his family but I felt that at times it took away some of the continuity and pace.The movie works well and shows what the price of just wanting to be honest in a corrupt world can be. A both important and powerful movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Insider
19,view_and_review,"Two Men, Two Fights",8,18 December 2020,"I love movies that are based upon real events and go into detail about the event being covered.""The Insider"" is about two men fighting two battles against two corporations. One man is Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe) who was a scientist with the tobacco company Brown & Williamson. He had critical knowledge about the chemicals being used in cigarettes, but was not allowed to share it due to a confidentiality agreement he had with the company.The other man was Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who was a producer for the show ""60 Minutes."" CBS corporate wanted to squash the Mike Wallace interview with Wigand that would expose the entire tobacco industry and Lowell was trying every trick he knew to get that interview televised.This movie was about the importance of the media in bringing certain scandals and travesties to light while also showing how the media can be controlled when certain interests are threatened. Running parallel to that was the story of a man conflicted. He could violate his confidentiality agreement, possibly be imprisoned due to such a violation, and lose everything or keep quiet and let the multi-billion dollar tobacco company continue to do what they do.This movie reminded of movies such as ""All the King's Men"" and ""Kill the Messenger"" which focused on relentless journalists exposing government corruption. I like the idea of journalists not beholden to the state who go in and expose corruption to the American people.""The Insider"" was properly done. They took the time necessary to develop the plot and hone in on details to stress the significance of it all. Pacino was wonderful as the idealistic SJW producer willing to stand up to the likes of CBS and Crowe was a close second to Pacino. I remember the big tobacco trials back in '98, but these are details I'd never heard.",The Insider
20,evanston_dad,Insanely Entertaining,10,28 June 2010,"Absolute stunner from Michael Mann about an everyday Joe (Russell Crowe, fattened out and uglied up) who teams with a powerhouse attorney (Al Pacino) to expose corrupt dealings at a big tobacco company.The film is based on a true story, and the payoff is only as good as it was in real life, which is modest to say the least. But the film benefits from smokin' direction from Mann and stellar performances by Crowe, Pacino and Chrisopher Plummer, who plays Mike Wallace, the man who broke the story to the American people on ""60 Minutes.""

21,anaconda-40658,Inside Corruption.,10,27 December 2015,"The Insider (1999): Dir: Michael Mann / Cast: Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, Diane Venora, Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall: Based on a true story regarding toxic elements in cigarettes and the inside man with crucial information that would break the tobacco company and perhaps jeopardize himself and his family. Aired on 60 Minutes in 1994 with Al Pacino as a journalist unable to protect the one person with information. Russell Crowe is fired from his job when the incident becomes public, but Pacino wishes to break the story wide open despite negative reactions from co-workers. Apparently the story cannot be aired because it tells the truth. Tremendous film directed by Michael Mann who previously made The Last of the Mohicans. Crowe brings integrity as a man who stands by truth yet possibly gambling a big loss and severe consequences in the process. Pacino is commanding as a journalist out to expose the tobacco industry yet stands by the truth even at the cost of his own job. Diane Venora plays Crowe's frustrated wife who leaves him and thus becomes more or less expendable to the movie. Christopher Plummer steals scenes as another journalist doing daring interviews and agreeing to one with Crowe. Philip Baker Hall plays Dan Hewitt, creator and producer behind 60 Minutes. Insightful film about overcoming corruption despite the odds. Score: 10 / 10",The Insider

23,Sylviastel,Truth is Stranger Than Fiction!,10,17 January 2010,"60 Minutes is one of our finest television hours today. It has been around since the late sixties and has become a fixture on Sunday nights. As it gets older, it gets better. If you are not a fan of 60 Minutes, you might be after this film. It's one of the most incredible news hours on television. I always watch the show on Sunday nights. Anyway, this film is inspired by the actual events that brought a segment to life despite the possible devastation and possible ruin of CBS and 60 Minutes. Russell Crowe played Dr. Jeffrey Wigrand, a tobacco industry scientist, who gets fired and realized his industry's lies. Somehow Pacino played Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer, who gets the story with Wigrand's interview which could shatter the tobacco industry's image as ignorant about the effects of smoking. Well, I think this film belongs to Pacino because he's brilliant in the role. Crowe does a brilliant performance as Wigrand, torn between his family and the truth. Christopher Plummer should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mike Wallace. There are not many actors who could have pulled off Mike Wallace but Plummer does a brilliant job that was ignored at Oscar time. Still the cast is brilliant with Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife; Debi Mazar as his assistant; Diane Venora as Mrs. Wigrand.",The Insider
24,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) The Insider (1999),8,23 July 2006,"Directed by Michael Mann, The Insider belonged to the category of movies with a number of nominations for an Academy Award, but won none. Based on a true story (of course with some dramatic license taken) involving the CBS hit television documentary series 60 Minutes, this is a rare insight into the time when the acclaimed series faltered in its editorial stand.WIth whistle-blowing having the local spotlight in recent months, no thanks to the NKF fiasco, this movie tells the tale of integrity in investigative journalism, and how two men rose to overcome personal challenges, to put out a story with damning evidence against the tobacco industry.Russell Crowe plays Dr Jeffrey Wigand, an R&D vice president at Brown & WIlliamson, recently fired for reasons unknown. As he holds an important role in the company, his severance package requires him, and I suppose like all leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies do, to sign a confidentiality agreement. However, he's holding onto something big that could damage the industry, and with these companies, having their reputations and industry survival put on the line, is never cowering to non-conformists.Herein lies the dilemma about moral obligation - if you're privy to industry information that is sensitive to the company, yet in the public's eye can help save lives, and put things into perspective, would you go public with the information? Wigand was undecided, but hearsay of horror stories, and being compelled to believe that he and his family were being watched, and threatened, he made up his mind that enough was enough, and did what a man would have done, even though it was against his wife's wishes, and didn't the guarantee safety of his family.Besides Wigand, the other protagonist is Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who is a producer at the famed 60 Minutes. Fighting to get Wigand's story told, he too runs into opposition from all angles, including internal ones at CBS News. To survive, he had to rely on personal wit and contact to establish and swing things around in his favour, even resorting to giving unauthorized scoops into the inside happenings at 60 Minutes when they decided to air an abridged version of the story.The movie raises a number of interesting questions about the wheelings and dealings of the supposedly free press in the USA, and how when you're under media scrutiny, every little dirty detail you have hidden about your past, will be brought up and blown out of proportion. Grim reminder, but true.The acting by the two leads will keep you riveted as you watch the entire proceedings unfold, until Massive Attack's Safe From Harm (just the remixed instrumental) closes the curtain. Code 1 DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a 7min production making-of featurette where you'll see the real Lowell Bergman and Dr Jeffrey Wigand, and a relatively useless Inside A Scene segment where you'll see a partial notes to the actors, script, and the actual scene again, how it played out according to paper.",The Insider
25,Mr-Fusion,Riveting!,9,26 May 2015,"The main draw for ""The Insider"" (for me) isn't the whistleblower story that takes center stage, but the ""other"" one that happens after Russell Crowe has breached his contract and given an interview with 60 Minutes. It's the trials of Pacino's character trying to get the story on the air that really resonate with me. Which isn't to say one half is better than the other - this is an extremely watchable film, start to finish - just that you can almost feel Edward R. Murrow's spirit looming large over the proceedings as the power of the press is (almost) smothered by Big Tobacco.Either way, this remains one of my favorite Michael Mann films, almost sneakily compelling as it contains no shootouts, hit men or neon atmosphere. But the pacing here is impeccable.9/10",The Insider
26,namashi_1,Fantastic!,10,5 November 2011,"Based on the true story of a 60 Minutes television series segment, as seen through the eyes of a real tobacco executive, Jeffrey Wigand, 'The Insider', directed by Michael Mann, is a fantastic film, that brings a true-story on celluloid, most convincingly. Also, the performances, are awesome! 'The Insider' Synopsis: A research chemist comes under personal and professional attack when he decides to appear in a ""60 Minutes"" expose on Big Tobacco.'The Insider' begins & ends, with a bang. As mentioned before, it brings a true-story on celluloid, most convincingly. Mann's direction, is captivating. While the Screenplay by Marie Brenner Eric Roth & Mann's himself, is simply fantastic. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are excellent. Performance-Wise: Al Pacino is spell-binding, as always. Pacino, is truly, an unstoppable/unmatchable talent. Russell Crowe is absolutely astonishing. He lives his part in every scene, with rare understanding & patience. Christopher Plummer is another topper; he is fabulous. Renee Olstead is first-rate. Philip Baker Hall is flawless, while Gina Gershon is effective in a brief role. Diane Venora & Lindsay Crouse are good. Others lend good support. On the whole, 'The Insider' is a fantastic motion-picture. It is amongst Mann's most accomplished works to date. Do Yourself A Favor: Watch 'The Insider'.

27,blanbrn,An in depth and provocative and compelling legal emotional drama that fights for answers while wanting a search for justice.,9,17 May 2016,"Finally after many years watched Michael Mann's legal drama 1999's ""The Insider"" and it was clearly a well done legal drama that searches for answers and blows the whistle on those in power who try to hide corruption that blends greed and power. The film recounts a chain of events that pitted a guy against the giant tobacco industry. And this film would really be in depth and drag the characters thru a fight of their lives.Al Pacino(still one of the best actors in the business)is in top form with a strong performance as veteran ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe(is the man affected by it all the insider himself former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand). The story is pretty cut and dry when Wigand is fired by the tobacco company, he agrees to become a paid consultant for a story that Bergman and ""60 Minutes"" is working on about the unethical ways within the tobacco industry. This all leads to a long battle between all with a lot of legal cat and mouse games which puts everyone's reputations on the line.As expected the tobacco industry will use any legal and corporate means they can to help save a billion dollar a year habit. Still both Bergman and Wigand are fighters that are searching for answers and they want justice in the form of truth as with every little bit more evidence is uncovered.Cleraly this is a harrowing drama with legal and emotional twist and turns it has an in depth cold hard edge that keeps you glued while searching for answers and fighting for the truth with twist.

28,KineticSeoul,Slow paced but gets engaging and even a bit heart-wrenching as it progresses,7,5 March 2012,"I am not a big fan of Micheal Mann as a director but he made few great movies and this is one of them. Micheal Mann has a style of directing that influenced other directors and it really works in this movie. It's a shame that this movie faltered when it came to the box office earning when the movie itself beats most movies that are Hollywood. But when it comes to box office earnings it's like that for most of his movies. But in this case it's understandable because this isn't a movie of the mass audience although it's a good movie. Especially since you have to focus a lot to the dialogue in order to understand what is going on. Al Pacino is good in this but Russell Crowe is excellent for this role. This has a ambitious journalist/producer for CBS news Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) going after Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe) who is a man of integrity but works for major tobacco company as general manager but gets fired for big information that can be breaking news. And these vital information can help others in a positive manner. But he is under a confidential agreement which he tries to keep but is being pushed around to the point of breaking. In another words he is the insider of one of one of the biggest company. The execution of this movie is very well done although it takes patience to get use to and it's not a big shock that this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Award Nominations. However if your looking for a action thriller this movie will not be for you. But what this is, is a realistic and intelligent approach to a journalist and a insider with some excellent dialogue. This is what movies that deserve award nominations is about.7.9/10",The Insider
29,sddavis63,Gripping All The Way Through,9,23 March 2001,"There's hardly a flaw in this true account of the 60 Minutes expose of a tobacco industry cover-up.Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air. This is just a marvelous film.From the beginning scenes of the setting up of an interview between Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer, who does a valiant job in a difficult role, playing someone as well known as Wallace) and an Arab sheik involved with the Hezbollah movement we get a sense of the point to come: that dealing with Middle East terrorists is a lot safer than taking on the tobacco industry! We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything. Wigand, who worked as a senior executive for a tobacco company, is a health care specialist with a seriously asthmatic daughter.The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure. The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle. The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.This movie is absolutely worth the watching. It is vaguely ominous as we're confronted by the power not just of the tobacco industry, but of big business in general. Definitely a 9 out of 10.",The Insider
30,ElMaruecan82,The toughest battles are always internal...,9,25 February 2017,"It's interesting that, on several occasions, ""The Insider"" insists on the fact that it was a dramatization and at times fictionalization of real-life events as if the makers decided to adopt the characters' honesty and transparency. It's all to the credit of Eric Roth and Michael Mann who respectively wrote and directed a powerful drama about men caught in professional and ethical dilemmas, but ultimately, making the right choice. Still, this is a long road to these 'right choices', paved with seemingly insurmountable obstacles -the worst being internal- and depicted through a claustrophobic and moody thriller.For the thrills, ""The Insider"" relies on a heavy editing, an abundance of phone calls between angry protagonists, a succession of threats and volte-faces, of confused hesitations and divisive decisions, the overall effect is dizzying and upsetting, there are many reliefs where the characters can question their choices but it's only at the end that we can finally breath. And as inspirational as the message is, we're also glad that this exhaustive journey has finally ended. There's no cheers, no arms raised, no champagne popping, no exchange of smiles, there's a feeling of sheer loneliness that inhabit all the players of this influence-wrestling game between tobacco companies and the fourth estate as if one couldn't lead a collective crusade without condemning himself to an individual exile.It doesn't work for every movie but in the case of ""The Insider"", Michael Mann managed to inject a sense of existentialism in this quest for truth, that's not a matter of opinion that what the tobacco company did was wrong on every level, and even a smoker wouldn't deny it, but how about having the courage to denounce it? That's the whole point of whistle blowing, and the ungrateful burden rests on the shoulders on chemist Dr. Jeffrey Wygand (Russel Crowe), who meets CBS producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) after he's just lost his job. The meeting is purely coincidental but once Bergman understands that Wygand is under a contract of confidentiality, his instinct tells him that something doesn't smell good about the tobacco industry, and it's not just tobacco.Wygand is a man of probity, and never is this certitude shaken to pretend to mislead us, even when the adverse parties try to sabotage his image. What the film shows though is that he's a man of responsibility. If he speaks, he loses all his severance benefits and will be sued, not to mention the psychological effect of death threats and the growing discouragement of his wife (Renee Olstead). The marital element is crucial because there's no attempt of understanding what her husband is going through, all she sees is that they will lose the house, the ones where their daughters made their first steps, their privileges, their comfort, everything they built. From the moment, Wygand embarks in this battle, it's like an earthquake menacing the foundations of their marriage, and it's a matter of time before the inevitable. The tragedy is also on a private level.And Russell Crowe plays Wygand in such a way that we can relate to him, a man who's caught in a worse fight than one on the battlefield because it's permanent and affects his life on a daily basis. Take the trigger of his decision to accept the interview with CBS, only when he's threatened in a patronizing way by his former bosses, he accepts CBS' deal. His ego is tickled, he makes the right choice for the wrong reasons, but it's still right in the sense that it will then throw the 'hot potato' to the journalist and confront them to their own ethical hypocrisy, when CBS is confronted to the legal intricacies that would force them to pay one hell of a bill if they ever interfere between a company and a worker. There comes a point where everyone must make a choice and pay the price.Mike Wallace, one of the most enduring and respected correspondents of the CBS ""60 Minutes"" program, played by Christopher Plummer, uses all available means and his power to get the interview done, he's a man who interviewed tyrants and politicians, but he can taste the sour irony when the ""seven dwarfs"" of the third major tobacco company are preventing him from doing his job and forcing him to surrender to the cause of money. While he does play in the same team than Bergman, he's powerless when the real threat comes from ""inside"", quite fitting, given the film's title. Publishing the interview might ruin the channel's deal with Westinghouse, which represents a great opportunity of financial expansion. And now, the journalists are entrapped in the same dilemma. Bergman couldn't understand Wygand, until the end.The merit of ""The Insider"" is to highlight the truth that there's not one courageous step that doesn't have a price.And while the film is driven by the whole chronicles of fact and investigation procedures, it really gets into an unexpected level of poignancy when the main players are confronted to their failures, ignoring that they are temporary. When Wygand learns that the airing is canceled, his reaction is pleasantly surprising, by that time, he's divorced and he's alone, but what he deplores is that his daughters will never know why their lives had taken such a dramatic change, to realize that it was worth it. And Wallace has a powerful exchange with Bergman, aware that infamy lasts longer than glory, and that this failure might ruin his legacy, because what he did was betraying the legacy of Edward Murrow, and since I recently saw ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", I could appreciate the comparison.Truth ultimately triumphed and yes, it was all worth it, but it was an omelet that broke many eggs, and many spirits, but it's a triumph nonetheless and Wygand, Bergman and Wallaces' legacies wouldn't suffer from it otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie like ""The Insider"".",The Insider
31,paul2001sw-1,The corporate law,8,7 November 2010,"In general, I'm not a huge fan of the films of Michael Mann, finding them unsubtle; and I delayed watching 'The Insider' for precisely that reason. A film about a heroic whistle-blower fighting against the evils of big tobacco: it sounds like a black and white story. And there are certain clichés in this movie: the selfish wife, for example, who doesn't stand by her husband when he can no longer provide for her in the style to which she was accustomed (although I fear that in one scene, where she contemplates the awful possibility that she might have to go out to work, that the audience is actually being encouraged to sympathise with her). And yet the first two thirds of this movie is really strong. Mann gets his A-list cast to justify their salaries, none more so than Russel Crowe as the whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigland, who displays a character he doesn't often show: nerdy, insecure, un-self confident, torn between conscience and self-interest. Precisely because Wigland is not obviously a wonderful (or indeed a terrible) human being, but an ordinary man, the story is more interesting; and black-and-white or not, the story of such an individual fighting the huge power of corporate America is terrifying and brilliantly told. I was gripped; but the last third of the movie doesn't quite have the same power. Partly it's because we see the same story again, now within a news organisation thinking about broadcasting an interview with Wigland. But however passionately the journalists care about the story, it's hard to believe that this is their fight in quite the same way it's Wiglands, some themes are repetitive, and the idea that a news organisation should make its decisions without commercial considerations is frankly nonsense; every journalist gets their salary only because someone is prepared to pay for the product, and I find it hard to believe that this is the only time that C.B.S. news has fallen beneath a standard of 100% purity. In this final part, Mann orchestrates more scenes with big music, perhaps because there a less powerful drama beneath it. Moreover, it's never completely clear what exactly is unique about Wigland's information. Yet for three hours, Mann made me share in his characters' well justified fear of persecution. That's an achievement; and this (in my opinion) is his best film.",The Insider
32,ThomasDrufke,The Lengths People Will Go to Hide the Truth,7,30 May 2018,"When two legends of the silver screen join forces to act against one another, it's typically something special. The Insider provided just that, a visceral and relentless intense take on the Tobacco industry whistleblower, Jeffrey Wigand. Both Russell Crowe (Wigand) and Al Pacino (Lowell Bergman) do a great job of playing off each others strengths as characters and as actors. And really this film is a brilliantly poignant take on the lengths at which both sides will go (during a whistleblowing incident) to keep the truth hidden or revealed. The only thing I could have used a little bit more of is Wigand's reasoning behind why he should reveal to the world the truth behind this particular Tobacco. I got all the reasons and examples as to why he should keep his family safe (among many other things), but I feel like I didn't get enough from the movie as to why he should risk his life and come clean.

It's tense, taut, thrilling, and even has some chilling moments. I never thought a movie that deals with the issue of cigarettes would turn out to be such a fascinating film, but as usual I was wrong. Not only was this film wonderfully acted, it had a steady pace, a well-written script, and wonderful directing by Michael Mann.Michael Mann's film is about a tobacco industry whistleblower named Jeffrey Wigand who got fired from his job and he decides to testify against the company thanks to the efforts of Lowell Bergmann and his 60 Minutes crew and the American legal system. However the careers of Wigand and Bergmann might be on the line if this goes out to the public.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are two very talented actors that have blessed us with their screen talent over the years. Pacino seems to have gotten better with age and he showcases great acting in the film. Russell Crowe has a memorable performance as Wigand. He does a good job playing the shy, not-wanting-to-talk type of people.Overall, they have found away to make corporate dramas interesting as proved here. This could have easily been a dry, boring movie but the subtle directing by Mann makes this a thriller that will keep your mind and heart racing. However, I want to mention that although this is based off a true story, there are some changes made for dramatical purposes. But still, I don't go to the movies for a history lesson, but for enjoyment. I rate this film 9/10.",The Insider
34,lesleyharris30,"Powerful Perfornances and a very Interesting Story,",8,4 May 2015,"The Insider is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very thrilling film with inspired performances from the entire cast, particularly Russell Crowe and Al Pacino of course, packed with some very intense scenes and superb dialogue. I feel like it was certainly longer than it needed to be, though this is an interesting story, it didn't need to be almost three hours long, it had a complicated story but they easily could have taken stuff out and made it shorter and sweeter for an average moviegoer, instead it added more stuff that didn't really happen. Michael Mann was certainly the perfect choice to direct this, he is fantastic at capturing the darkness of real life events, there were moments were I felt like I was genuinely there with these characters, I felt the seriousness of this true story. Intense and very well acted, I would recommend the Insider to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller. After appearing on an episode of 60 Minutes, a man gets himself in to huge legal trouble as his involvement is revealed. Best Performance: Al Pacino",The Insider
35,secondtake,"Based on truth, pulling no punches, brilliantly made top to bottom. Amazing.",9,5 March 2010,"The Insider (1999)Wow, this is a searing, amazing tour-de-force. It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, cliché, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the ""insider"" himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.",The Insider
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Crap!,1,21 July 2000,"At the beginning of this year something was seriously wrong with the majority of reviewers in the world. For some strange and obscure reason they all gave top marks to junk like this, American Beauty and Being John Malkovich. Although I understand why they did this for the latter there is no excuse and no denying that The Insider is quite possibly the most over-rated and over-hyped film ever that was unfortunate enough to be seen only by totally biased audience. Except me of course. The story is about Jeff Wigand, who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and wants to do an interview with 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. At first he does not want to do it but thanks to pressure increasingly mounted on him he decides to do it out of spite and retaliation it seems. You see the tobacco companies do not want Wigand to let the whole world know that cigarettes are addictive. But everyone knows that anyway so what's the big deal? It's hardly big screen material. It may make an 85-minute long TV movie but it certainly cannot stretch over 2 and a half hours even with the talents of Al Pacino and Russell Crowe to support it.Let me just say that Heat was cool. Long, but still a very good film. I do admit that Michael Mann is a good director, but every director coughs up a severe dud once in a while. For Steven Spielberg there was Amistad and for Kubrick there was Eyes Wide Shut. Both of these films received excellent reviews for one reason only: the reputation of the director. This is why so many people lied to themselves that The Insider is a good film (snigger). No way! Out of sheer respect to Michael Mann the whole world has given false review of this film but I'm about to give you the truth. The rest of mankind has been so brainwashed that The Insider is Oscar-worthy so they might try to hurt me for telling you this, but because I'm such a humanitarian I'm willing to risk it. THE INSIDER IS GARBAGE! There I said it.A Shocking amount of characters appear for a few seconds or maybe even longer and then disappear for the whole movie without them even being introduced to us or at least telling us their purpose to the story. This makes a series of confusing and drama-free events even more blurred and low in any kind of narrative. Mann also goes as far to not even give us reasons for events taking place. Like those men in black suits who just enter Jeff Wigand's (Russell Crowe) home and take his hard drive. Who were they? Who sent them? Why didn't Wigand do anything about it? Like call the police or even tell Bergman (Pacino). This scene is embarrassing to watch because Wigand is such a wimp. He does nothing! If someone came into my home I wouldn't just let them take my computer without doing anything.The only thing that is decent in this travesty is Dante Spinoti's widescreen photography, which is stunning. The scene with Bergman knee-deep in the ocean is a great example of wonderful cinematography. But that isn't enough. Sadly The Insider is as bloated as it is self-important and boring as it is confusing. A huge big mess. At the end you feel so bum-numbed and exhilarated that you just want to lie down. Maybe some people confused this sensation as the result of seeing a good movie. Which it certainly is NOT! Beware! 1/10.Shawn Watson",The Insider

This is a much better movie than I Remembered, but it's still long and slow at times, and I do still think it could use a bit of trimming here and there.

The compelling story of ""big tobacco"" intimidating a ""whistle blower"" is drawn out to monumental proportions. I definitely felt like the film was going round and round with little forward motion. At least 30 minutes on the cutting room floor would have been most welcome. I am suggesting that the ""big name cast"" was simply being put on display for as long as possible and let the chips fall where they may. Christopher Plummer comes out the best as Mike Wallace, because his screen time is limited. On the other hand Al Pacino and Russell Crowe seem over exposed to the point of weariness, and I definitely felt that less would have been best. - MERK",The Insider
41,zkonedog,Nothing Black and White About This Film,9,11 March 2017,"If there's one thing I hate about certain movies, it is that they are too ""black and white"". I'm not talking pigmentation, though, but rather the depth of the plot and characters. Life is too complicated and filled with shades of gray to be simplified at the theater, and I'm glad ""The Insider"" doesn't pander in that fashion.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former ""Big Tobacco"" scientist who must decide whether to keep the trade secrets, or blow the whistle on the most powerful business entity in the U.S. On the story is journalist Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who (against his ethical code) becomes personally involved with Wigand and as such gets drawn even deeper into the business intrigue.There is nothing simple about this film: Should Wigand do the interview and put his family in danger all in the name of ""ethics""? Should Bergman take the case to another level at the expense of HIS future? Nearly ever situation in the movie will make you contemplate what is ""right"" or ""wrong"".What really makes this solid film into a 5-star experience, though, is the acting of Pacino. I never really got into Pacino's earlier mob flicks, but his later-years work (like here) really impresses me. Does he play essentially the same character all the time? Absolutely. But it doesn't matter in the slightest because he is so incredible at it. The most natural ""intense guy"" actor I've ever seen.Thus, ""The Insider"" is a great movie that will draw you in with the engaging plot, incredible acting, and the real-life setting based on a true story. I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.",The Insider
42,johnnyboyz,"Captivating; enrapturing and enthralling legal thriller, with which the superlatives just about run out as some terrifying dramatisations take centre stage.",9,9 February 2011,"Michael Mann's The Insider is perhaps one of the most accomplished thrillers I've ever seen, a nigh on two and a half hour battle through turmoil; plight; anguish and terror so as to show up those evil enough to do what they do. The film, one of the very best of not only its respective year but the decade of the 1990s, is a thrilling; alarming and intuitive legal thriller based mostly on fact about the proverbial little guy suffering from fraught attacks of the conscience where those in the past have blazed through unabashed before eventually going on a campaign with the view to triumph over megalomania. In all of its runtime, there is barely a dull nor uninteresting moment; Mann effectively going on to tell two tales of hard-edged and immense confrontation that is never anything less that wholly fascinating as it juggles character with narrative with a real sense of filmmaking.One of the two chief protagonists is Al Pacino's Lowell Bergman, a journalist more specifically tied to a television news production named ""60 minutes""; our first sight of this man highlighting his unwavering ability to deal with what seems a rather hair raising situation when he occupies a small room, blindfolded, and manages to swing an interview with a stiff and uneasily moved Lebanon based Sheikh. Once a worker for a publication entitled 'Ramparts Magazine', the inferring that he has come a long way in his chosen field feels prominent. As things unfold, he'll go on to become more deeply involved in the affairs of Russell Crowe's Jeffrey Wigand; a recently fired tobacco company executive whom drives home to distorted editing and cold blue hues as the reaction to being let go settles on his mind. The few fleeting moments we see of the man at his office has him observe the staff party going on next door as he packs away his things alone, the sense of him being an outsider; disconnected or disenchanted with those of whom he works prominent - nobody is seeing him off, and this disconnection or alienation to his workplace or company comes to feature prominently later on. His wife is Liane (Venora), one of his two young daughters is Barbara (Eisenberg) whom suffers from asthma.Their coming together is through a series of crude and unspecific faxes they send to each another, Bergman's receiving of numerous tobacco company documents sees him contact Wignard for specificities on the subject. One thing leads to another and his ex-tobacco company, representative of Michal Gambon's cold and methodical in tone but large and imposing and authoritative in figure, megalomaniac calls him in to reach some sort of confidentiality deal. Crowe's character is seated in-front of his former boss as another employee looms anonymously as well as ominously behind Crowe whilst cut off at the shoulders; the deal he's called in for breaking down and causing all manner of antagonism and conflict. The resulting threats cause them to revoke his medical related compensation after being fired, meaning they are effectively targeting doing young Barbara harm and are therefore even more efficient as the villains of the piece.Mann's film is a documenting of the plump, bleary-eyed and somewhat weedy looking Wignard going up against this company with the keen and effectual Bergman. On most of the occasions Crowe's character occupies the screen, he's shot in an unflattering manner; his ambling and stumbling frame not particularly complimenting his overall build and going hand-in-hand with the relatively concurrent close ups of his facial features that dominate the frame: his expression rendered desperate and this working particularly well during the instances in which Wignard is on the telephone so as to capture this grossly unflattering look. The interplay is illuminating, the observing of this man in Wignard just having his life crumble in-front of him born out of the threats his ex-company implant onto him and the paranoia he carries that Bergman is merely in it for himself as a journalistic coup is morbidly fascinating.Mann balances each of the respective plights ingeniously; where he has his audience sympathise with Crowe, he has them associate themselves with Pacino as this outsider to both the story and the finer details of the case. Where it's established the tobacco company are evil, sinful, grotesquely amoral, loathsome and downright putrid in their actions anyway, Mann has them simultaneously deny nicotine as a suspiciously addictive material as well as demean the war dead when a small but revealing little moment sees Wignard's vehicle pause beside a Second World War memorial graveyard as Wignard sits in the foreground while the man travels to speak openly about things his ex-employers would prefer aren't revealed: the exercising of one's freedom of speech over which those in the graveyard we have resonating in the background essentially died for, and the same freedom of speech the imperialist mega-corporation essentially wish to suppress or take away, feeling prominent. Mann's The Insider is a quite brilliant dramatisation of some eerily true-to-life events, one of the best legal thrillers of recent times and a powerhouse of the filmmaking hallmarks in editing; direction; acting and cinematography combining to form something quite special.",The Insider

The performances of Al Pacino and Crowe are particularly worthy of congratulations, with both actors managing to give substance and soul to their characters. Crowe even stayed some time near the real Dr. Wigand in order to observe his ways, gestures and behavior, which only shows the quality of this actor and the professionalism of his work.

44,leplatypus,Don't worry : you can safely watch this movie as it won't absolutely addict you (rental),1,30 March 2014,"As a hardcore Pacino's fan, i had always highly reservations about this movie as watching two guys phone-talking for two hours isn't my vision of filmmaking. I do all i could do to not see it but today is the day : At the end and to resume, for a 150 minutes movie, i think i pushed « forward » for about 90 minutes. However, for historians, this flick has the value of benchmarking the start of the garbage era for Hollywood ! It has all the indigestible ingredients that i watch for about fifteen years now: color grading using only teal and orange ; story shortened to mobile conversations (« Star Trek » was intelligent to use that only for beaming up, Scotty !); product placements (pay attention to « rice ») ; reconstructed truth just for the sake of drama ; familial values going in the sink (the house is more important than the wedding vow) ; Oscars going crazy (7 nominations for that ?) ; Al is convincing as an upright, true journalist, Plummer, Chambon and the kid from « Beautiful » were good but Crowe is just awful with his boring interpretation of this torn man ! Beyond this, the movie misses really the point and take its audience for small brains: i'm not a scientist, but with millions of smokers who can't stop the habit, i think people has already deduced that cigarettes were addictive ! The only interesting case here is the fact that medias have merged with politics in selling their souls to corporation : The latter tell democracy and do oligarchy, the former investigate truth and publish lies. If i got it right, the « seven dwarfs » having drugged the citizens, they could easily extort colossal money that they use to buy anyone that could be a nuisance against them !

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Journalism drama has a universal reach in Mann's hands,10,6 June 2009,"Not since 1976's ""All the President's Men"" has a film shown how vital, dangerous and deeply conflicted the field of journalism is, and ""The Insider"" goes there and beyond. It's not just about professional and legal conflicts, but also issues of trust and dignity that have deep personal repercussions. Michael Mann (""Heat"") delivers yet another film that goes beyond its subject (journalism), beyond merely a plot with intriguing conflict and into a realm with ethical considerations for everyone.""The Insider"" delves into issues of confidentiality and where journalism's first allegiance is by telling the story of how former ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) convinced a top researcher for a Big Tobacco company, Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), to come on camera with information implicating the industry for knowingly enhancing the addictiveness of the nicotine in its products. But Mann isn't as interested in the logistics of the legal processes and whatnot as he is the personal implications for Wigand, Bergman and CBS. Issues of trust and moral responsibility abound. Wigand and Bergman develop a relationship both with the most honorable intentions in our eyes -- Bergman wants the truth and Wigand wants to risk his financial well-being to enlighten the public, but Wigand's paranoia and the responses by Big Tobacco lawyers create a shaky dynamic between the two. The cast is loaded with incredible talent (Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, Rip Torn, etc.) but Pacino and Crowe are the most necessary to mention. Pacino brings his same machismo: he sounds as if he knows exactly what he's talking about -- his reactions when his character comes under fire are calculated and not overplayed, even when he does his signature shouting. As for Crowe, his character's emotional issues are apparent and his execution of this is vital at taking us beyond the issue at hand and having great sympathy for his conundrum: to tell the truth he risks his family and his livelihood. His performance, in addition with that in ""L.A. Confidential"" is all the proof necessary that this guy can act.Mann and ""Forrest Gump"" writer Eric Roth deliver a script that while certainly busy with many characters that are hard to discern at times, perfectly gets across exactly what needs to be said as succinctly as possible to both move plot and provoke thought. It's very easy to stay with this film despite needing to move quickly to fit everything into 155 minutes.Especially journalists, but everyone who has daily ethical concerns with their job, can also appreciate the fairness with which the film handles both sides of the debate. Basically, CBS makes a critical decision on whether to air the interview and both sides make convincing arguments. The best part is that what's unquestionably, morally right wins out in this film despite it's very psychologically damaging consequences on its main characters. As Mann points out, where the truth is concerned, it's not all about who wins, but it's the principle on which you got there.""The Insider"" is thought-provoking and insightful, a true example of how one specialized area like investigative journalism and confidentiality law suits can become universally understood through great dramatic writing and the write talent executing it.",The Insider
48,Anonymous_Maxine,Excellent legal drama,10,2 April 2001,"In The Insider, Russell Crowe once again proves his versatility as an actor. It's amazing how different he looks in this film from his other roles, particularly Mystery, Alaska and Gladiator. Here, he plays the part of Jeffrey Wigand, a man who is torn between his responsibility to uphold his agreement to keep his mouth shut about happenings with a gigantic tobacco company and his duty to inform the public of potentially harmful products. He was fired from his position as the head of research and development, and as he gingerly begins to speak to Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a spokesman from 60 Minutes, he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family. Crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance, as does Al Pacino, who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for. Not only is this a very interesting story, but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work, with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show, 60 Minutes, being presented in a new light.

How can a movie about a lawsuit be so captivating, astonishing, touching and thrilling from beginning to end? Well, seeing is believing and watching ""The Insider"" is the ultimate proof that a seemingly boring story about a lawsuit can have such a powerful impact. This movie is many things, it's a drama, a thriller and criticism of the suffocating entanglement of corporate industry with journalism.The true story by itself is already amazingly shocking, but the way it is directed, photographed, acted and scored is truly magnificent as well. Lots of praise for the terrific acting performances by Al Pacino and Russel Crowe, who lift this movie to a higher level.This movie is based on a true story about the secret injection of chemical ingredients in cigarettes, which were added by the tobacco company with the sole effect/purpose of enhancing addiction to smoking. One insider scientist (Russel Crowe), who worked for the tobacco industry decides to become a whistleblower and consequently gets attacked viciously with all means possible by the tobacco industry.

52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A perfect movie. And I don't throw that term around lightly.,10,10 March 2016,"There are some films that are so perfectly made in every way possible that I sit there thinking 'Every persons effort and every element of creative energy that went into making this movie has been implemented flawlessly, arriving here and now to give me the viewing experience I'm getting. A perfect movie'. Michael Mann's The Insider is such a movie. I held off on reviewing it for a couple days after seeing it, partly to let it sink in but mostly to see if I'd feel any different about it once my synapses had cooled down and the frames had dimmed from my consciousness. Perhaps the fiery reaction it drew from me in the moment was cheaply earned, or I was just in the right mood to love it at that time. Not a chance. If anything I've become more enraptured by it as time has passed, already aching for a second viewing. Every performance and aspect of is just so rich, deep and rewarding that for its two and a half hour runtime I found myself externally distracted not once. Occasionally Mann deviates from his comfort zone in the nocturnal crime zone. The occult themed period piece, the colonial adventure, the psychological horror, and this, the blistering drama based on a true story. One might not think the subject matter deserves a two and a half hour film, let alone would make a great one, but Mann has the cinematic Midas touch, and never half asses it. His work always contains traces of a true master at work, telling little details that engrave the film with a sense of immaculate skill and unwavering dedication to telling the story in its finest, and most honest form. The Insider tells the story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a chemist who turns whistleblower on the tobacco corporation he was once employed by, finding shelter under the wing of CBS News's 60 minutes, and particularly hard nosed reporter Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). The network wants his take, in order to do an exposé on Big Tobacco, a plan with predictably disastrous and dangerous results, for both Wigand and CBS. The film shakes off any impending sensationalism or deliberately emotional stylistic cheats, instead keeping a microscope focus on the three lead performances and letting all the hurt, determination and emotion come forth naturally through their work, as opposed to smothering their story with an overbearing score and cheap cinematic manipulation. I've never been that won over by Russell Crowe until now. He always seems 'halfway there' in his work, like he's missing something. This changed things for me. He's like a raw nerve here, a family man pushed to the precipice of an impossible decision. One can almost see him wrestling with his conscience behind those haunted eyes, a storm with a lid barely kept on and anchored by Crowe in his finest hour. Pacino holds us captive with his work until we realize we're not breathing. He's the moral compass of the piece, and to see him explode at the injustices served up to him will give you goosebumps. The third leg of the table is Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, the 60 minutes anchor who also struggles morally with the situation they are in. Plummer is so good you forget you're watching a film, giving Wallace buried gentleness and chiselled emotional intensity that you can scarce believe is even possible through acting. The supporting cast is peppered with bushels of talent. Colm Feore, Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Stephen Tobolowsky, Diane Venora, Nester Serrano, Rip Torn, Michael Gambon and an unusually sedated Debi Mazar are superb. It's Bruce McGill, however, who almost steals the film in one blistering scene, playing a lawyer with enough righteous anger to shatter your TV screen. A career best for him. No one puts you into a story by forcing you to feel alongside the characters quite like Mann. Here he guides through the trials that Crowe, Plummer and Pacino face with steady hand and heart until we are invested. Then he pulls the ripcord and let's the sparks fly, making monumentally intense work of events that could seem pedestrian in lesser hands. We really feel for Crowe and clutch the seat with the same desperate intensity that he clings to his family, and sanity. We feel the same jilted fury alongside Pacino as he wades through sickening bureaucracy for a shot at retribution. We take pause with Plummer as he ponders his legacy and are incredulous with all three at the snowball effect the entire proceeding has had on them, devastating us as an audience the same as them, in turn making us feel closer to them. This is all laced with the incredibly heartfelt music from Lisa Gerrard, who sang alongside Crowe in Gladiator and was a favourite of Tony Scott as well. Mann is a ceaseless monster of storytelling, tone and pacing. The story has flair simply because he doesn't wantonly throw it in the mix; the feeling and reaction come from story and character and not the razzle dazzle. Mann knows this, and let's the fireworks naturally spring from the absence of deliberation, like music in the vacuum of space. This one will live on to stand the test of time far longer than the decade and a half its help for already. It's a revelation.",The Insider
53,kairingler,Whistle Blower,6,10 August 2013,"I was kind of surprised that Michael Mann directed this,, usually his films have tons more action in them, that being said , I guess this isn't' sposed to be an action movie, it's about a Whistle Blower in the Tobacoo Industry,, a scientist who discovers what the big boys are up to trying to hook the American public into smoking cigarettes, and what deceptive practices and lying that they do,, such as spiking the cigarettes. he get's fired from Big Tobacco and has to sign a confidentiality agreement, saying that he wont' release secrets,, at first he doesn't want to but later agrees,, but then the company adds on more stuff to the agreement,, then he end up not signing it and the company goes after the ex employee,, sending him vicious notes in the mail, and fire bombing his house,, he goes to a reporter from 60 minutes for help,, not a bad movie,, just slow moving in parts,, a little hard to watch at times.",The Insider

55,jaybob,One of the most disappointing films of 1999,4,2 November 2000,"To put it simply & succinctly this film is a mess. The screenplay is disjointed & unless you are familiar with the original story on 60 minutes, you will have a hard time undertstanding what is going on. both Al Pacino & Russell Crowe act there hearts out & I for one found them not believable. Now my main gripe & my very low rating is for the music.One of the most aggravatingly bad scores,There are some supposed songs (you cant make out any lyrics at all), That is so annoying you wonder what is happening to  film music now a days.Also it is overly long & quite boring. The 158 minute length is way too long, An hour could have been easily cut.Respectivly submittedJay  Harris",The Insider
56,Agent10,The movie that should have won the best picture Oscar among the movies nominated,10,17 April 2002,"While Fight Club was the best movie from 1999, The Insider should have won the Oscar among the films nominated. Instead, they passed the award to the completely undeserving American Beauty. Russell Crowe shined as the tortured Wigand, even though the man in real life was actually kind of light hearted. I listened to him speak when he made a rare appearance in Tucson, displaying a persona that seemed far from the one portrayed in the movie. Al Pacino was probably the hippest news producer ever, and the film was most certainly a classic.Hopefully, people will give this film the respect it most certainly deserves.",The Insider
57,Boyo-2,I prefer to nap in quiet,4,26 February 2001,"God this movie felt like it would never end!  It made all its points 70 times and got to be an ordeal for me right away. Crowe is wildly miscast and not very good - was I supposed to see him as a regular guy doing the right thing, or as a martyr, or as a victim?  Crowe does not tip his hand enough, for me at least.  I never felt one way or the other about the man. Pacino was good and not over the top, which is nice for a change.  The rest of the cast is largely wasted, especially Debi Mazar and Gina Gershon.Best scene was Wigand's deposition, involving his lawyer (Bruce McGill, who was a cop in ""My Cousin Vinny"" and a jerk-in-a-suit in ""Silkwood"") and Wings Hauser (the deadly pimp in the fantastic ""Vice Squad"").  The entire movie should have had the energy these actors put into their scene together.
By the way, did Diane Venora turn into Jessica Lange, or is she just taking her rejected scripts?",The Insider
58,ShootingShark,Well-Made But Heavy-Going Expose Drama On The Tobacco Industry,5,18 June 2005,"A recently fired scientific adviser at a major US tobacco firm is approached by a CBS News journalist to help translate a safety report on fire risks from smoking. The adviser agrees to help but the journalist discovers he has much more sinister secrets to spill on studies into nicotine addiction and tobacco company policy. Inevitably, events spiral into a legal maelstrom of gagging orders, lawsuits and threatened libel action until ultimately both men start to doubt if what they are doing has any moral validity.This is a big film on a big subject and it's well made, but ultimately it's frustrating because it loses the thread of an important drama (the appalling depths the big tobacco firms will sink to in order to sell more of their addictive drugs and to cover up the evidence they are doing so) in favour of a much less interesting one (the reluctance of conservative media institutions to publish tough stories in the face of legal prosecution). It's also a little hard to judge because it's based on real events and people but it's also a Michael Mann film and therefore takes place in his highly stylised universe (the Crowe character is constantly worrying about money but always seems to be living in palatial accommodation). It also has some odd casting - Pacino and Plummer (as top US newsman Mike Wallace) are both very good, but Crowe is much too young, Venora and Crouse are wasted in decorative wife roles, and Gambon is just plain daft as a big US executive. In striving for realism, Mann loses his great gift for style and artistic excess, but the film is still fascinating and full of great moments, like the courtroom scene where McGill and Hauser chew each other out. In the end however, I would have preferred a shorter, fictional thriller about what might be happening in tobacco's sinister corridors of power than a rather stodgy drama about journalistic integrity. Hey, guess what - nobody smokes in this movie !!",The Insider
59,triple8,yes this was great.,10,23 July 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH: There is very little that I can add to many of the glowing reviews. I thought The Insider was incredible. Flawless from beginning to end. It's in the IMDb top 250 and small wonder. It was a superb movie.There are so many elements in this movie that are fascinating. The journalistic issues. The issues of whistle blowing and doing the right thing. In my view both the main characters are heroes. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it that much more fascinating.Pacino and Crowe both, in my opinion, gave flawless performances and both were excellent at drawing the viewer in(let me change that) SWEEPING the viewer in to their lives and the things they were fighting for. There are many movies that take on important issues but lack the ability to keep the movie interesting. That's not the case here as the movie literally simmers from start to finish and through the last hour or so, I don't think I moved. That's the type of film this is and it is absolutely outstanding.This was one of the best roles I've seen Al Pacino in and though I have not seen a lot of Crowe's work, he is wonderful here and well cast.The supporting cast was wonderful too. There have been so many movies made about deception and dishonesty, it's nice to see a movie where the main characters are courageous and heroic. The Insider is all at once absorbing, disturbing, thought provoking and triumphant. In other words, it's everything a good movie should be. This is a long movie but the time goes very quickly and it's not the type of movie that could have been any shorter. (It actually could have been even longer.) Everything from the acting to the camera work(some of it quite unusual) to the story itself is top notch and this is an example of a great film and that rare movie that myself and my film going friends can actually agree on. My vote is 10 of 10.",The Insider
60,Amyth47,Michael Mann Goes In!,8,24 August 2020,"My Rating : 8/10Pair Michael Mann with the intensity of Pacino and Crowe and things really start to heat up - 'The Insider' inspired by true events goes into an in-depth discussion of Big Tobacco and the repercussions to anyone trying to bring it down.A great movie on whistle-blowing, absolute must-see, the longer-than-average runtime doesn't feel like it at all - it's just a superbly engaging drama from start to finish.",The Insider
61,gazzo-2,Crowe and Mann were robbed....,8,1 January 2001,"This compared to American Beauty-this is to my thinking a better film, a decent portrayal of a real-life drama that we saw unfold on TV, in the press and on radio. What Mann, Pacino and Crowe have done is give us some of the more kinetic scenes and performances in the past 20 years or so. Terrific stuff at times.I had a few problems with the Insider, mostly in that they try to cram in too much without enough time devoted to them.Gina Gershon and Debi Mazar resemble each other enough so that I hadda really pay attention to tell who was who, and what it was Debi's character did. She has hardly any lines despite being in many scenes. Diane Verona as the long suffering Wife of Wigand isn't really developed into a three dimensional character, and I agree-when she leaves Crowe, we don't feel it as much as we ought.Hall and Plummer also resemble one another enough so that I found myself thinking-THAT is Hewitt, THIS is Wallace, more than once.
And there were a few scenes that did not fit-notably the 'FBI/Geologists in the restaurant' scene. I had no idea what 'arrest' they were talking about, or where this was in relation to the whole tobacco case until they wedged in the Unibomber stuff at the end. Maybe they coulda done without that entirely? I think so.But overall-the acting, the pacing, the feel for what these people went through, I found to be genuine, true, heartfelt, very well done. Crowe at times kept on looking like a guy who was my age(more or less) with white hair, but I still think he deserved an Oscar.Overall, a really goof film, and to my thinking, BETTER than American Beauty.***1/2 outta ****.",The Insider
62,JuguAbraham,Rich Michael Mann film but not his best,8,16 August 2001,"I consider Mann to be the second most important living director in the US. I became his fan after I watched Violent Streets (released in the US as     ) way back in the Eighties at the Indian International Film Festival in New Delhi. I had then written in the newspaper I was then working for that this director is somebody to watch out for. I am glad that some 20 years later I have been proven right. I consider him next in importance only to Terrence Mallick among living US directors. It is a shame that those associated with American Academy of Motion Pictures constantly bypass great talent on so many occasions. Overlooking the performances in the Insider and bestowing so many awards for American Beauty is crass injustice. The Insider is superior to American Beauty in several respects, acting, direction, music, photography At some stage in the Oscar history, this august body will realize that just as Orson Welles was ignored for his early work, great contributors to American cinema who are being ignored are Mann and Mallick. Both of them are consummate filmmakers: who take great care with story, screenplay, acting, editing, photography, sound and music. Mann, unlike Mallick, approaches less philosophical subjects and is therefore appreciated by a larger slice of the public. 
Why do I find Insider not to be his best work? The Insider's power is essentially in the content. That it is the work of Michael Mann and cinematographer Spinotti only adds flavor to the product. Mann is a director who could make James Caan, an average actor, appear impressive in `Violent Streets'. If he could do that it is not surprising to find superb performances from Crowe and Pacino in `The Insider'. Compare this with `Heat', whose story needed the superb treatment of Mann and Spinotti to come alive. In `The Insider,' the focus is understandably on the male duo and due to the documentary nature of the subject the women are pushed into the background. In `Heat', while the male duo carry the film, the female characters are not wallflowersall three wives/lovers grab your attention. Mann had a `compleat' film in `Heat'. That does not mean `The Insider' was not a great work-it had limitations to develop due to the subject.
Another great trademark of Mann is his opening sequences full of kinetic energy injected through sight and sound. However, the opening shots of `The Insider' reminded you of a Costa Gavras/Gillo Pontecorvo type of Sixties cinema, much less impressive than the powerful opening sequences of `Violent Streets' and `The Last of the Mohicans.'   Mann, Mallick, and Kubrick are directors who use sound and music with great felicity. In `The Insider' the scene of Wygand refusing to be disturbed in the hotel room is an example of this talent in Mann, with beautiful music, camerawork and special effects.Has Mann matured over the years? Definitely. Mann directing `The Insider' is more reflective and offers the viewer options to evaluate Wygand and other characters, which `Heat' did not. You begin to like Wygand as he makes the big decision as he stares out at the waterscape. You begin to doubt, as he cannot defend aspect s of his past. You begin to wonder if Wygand is using circumstances to be hero or if he is a true hero as he hits the golf balls in apparent solitude. In `Heat' there was no such ambiguity. His work is much better in `The Insider' than in `Violent Streets'. Yet `Heat' is in my opinion a more demanding and creative work compared to `The Insider'.",The Insider

64,denis888,A Very Good Ensemble Of Pacino And Crow,8,14 October 2007,"The Insider is a very serious film; it has none of typical Hollywood sweet sentiments. Instead, it offers us a very deep insight into the modern-day problem  a struggle between an individual and a multi-national tobacco corporation. All the means is good here  bribery, libel, lies and blackmail. But the main hero, here played by Russell Crow, is undaunted, and despite the threats and loss of a family, he goes on. Another main character, here performed by always impeccable Al Pacino, is a hot-tempered CBS journalist, who is not afraid either of some mighty Lebanese Mullah or not less mighty tobacco moguls. He also goes on and he wins. The happy end here is not a false, sugary sweet melodrama type of end. Nay, since the whole plot is based on a real story, the director Mike Mann made it as it was. Yes, the happy ending, but after so much sufferings and losses. What is good, the movie does not thrive on blood or violence. What is a bit rude and even shocking, all the heroes use too much of the F-word. The cameo appearances of Gina Gershon and Stephen Tobolowsky are also a nice surprise and they add some certain spice to the plot. In general, if you like deep, mature, serious dramas about every day life and such like, watch that! Mind some foul language, though.",The Insider
65,DeeNine-2,Al Pacino is the real John Wayne...,8,24 June 2000,"Or the Ronnie Reagan of the left. I mean this in both the positive sense that he is a cultural hero, and in the negative sense that he is a celluloid hero. I have seen so many Al Pacino movies that I feel not only that I know him, but that he is actually a character from my own life. I like him here as Lowell Bergman, a radical ex-Ramparts Magazine editor grown into middle age but still fighting the good fight from within the establishment of CBS and 60 Minutes. His hair still flies about, showing that he is a free soul who cares more about substance than appearance. (We realize that the dye job is a necessary concession to the media world in which he lives.) And the passion still burns bright in his dark eyes, and he's still as wiry as a teenager.But is this history? Is this the truth about what happened with Jeffrey Wigand, big tobacco and CBS? Or this 'revisionist history' dressed up dramatically to make the good guys look good and the bad guys look bad? I wish I could say this is how big time journalism really works, and that we have been afforded a true view inside the system. But it's hard to tell where the truth leaves off and dramatic license takes over. We learned in journalism long ago that there is no real objectivity; that all is to some extent interpretive. In fact I recall a college text we used in the sixties with the (then) arresting title, 'Interpretive Journalism.' Today's text might be called 'Subjective Journalism' and tomorrow's 'The Age of Tabloid Journalism.'Nonetheless, this is a very good movie. The script by Michael Mann and Eric Roth sparkles with the immediacy of today's headlines, and Mann's direction is clean, crisp and dramatically very sharp. Russell Crowe as Wigand, the biochemist who blew the whistle on big tobacco and lost his wife and children to divorce in the process, is excellent. His subtle and restrained interpretation of Wigand reminds me so much of those guys from my generation who opted for the security of the corporate structure, only in his case the misgivings got to him. Diane Venova is chilling in a small role as his wife, a house and home centered woman who leaves him because she doesn't think it's fair to subject her and the children to the dangers and financial uncertainties of his whistle-blowing activities. Wigand is the reluctant hero and she is the woman who did not stand by her man.Christopher Plummer does a good job of playing 60 Minutes's Mike Wallace, who gets plenty of egg on his face here. He looks pathetic in the scene where he talks about what he will be remembered for. I'm sure Wallace is mad as hell about the portrayal, but I don't think anybody is going to sue the producers of this movie, since it is so popular and so much in tune with what most of us believe to be true. Gina Gershon appears briefly as a greedy bottom line lawyer who cares nothing about journalism or the ethics of journalism.John Wayne fought the enemies of our culture on celluloid with true grit and an unwavering, if sometimes moronic, sense of what's right. Al Pacino does the same here, except our enemies have changed and what's right isn't so clear anymore and the war room has become the board room. The really melancholy thing is I guess I wanted to believe in John Wayne when I was a kid, and now as a middle aged man, I want to believe in Al Pacino and 60 Minutes. This movie helps.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Insider
66,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Highly dramatized but not bad,7,9 October 2014,"Alright, first off I'm not going to get into a debate about whether smoking is good or bad, I'm honestly not on one side or the other. I personally enjoyed The Insider; it was like a more modern Silkwood but instead of a low-class woman fighting against a nuclear plant it's a research chemist fighting against a tobacco corporation.Jeff has a high-paying job, a wonderful family and everything is looking up, but when he speaks out against Big Tobacco, it isn't long before his life begins to spiral downward. His daughter suffers from severe asthma that could be deadly without immediate care, and soon he comes home to an empty house. He's soon threatened and accused by Big Tobacco, until a reporter for CBS News wants to interview Jeff and blow the whistle on television.It's not the smoking or the ""evil corporation"" concept that's disturbing, what really was sad to watch was how quickly Jeff was alienated from his family for ""blowing the whistle"". Of course, The Insider isn't the first movie following this type of plot: Silkwood (1983), Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal (1982) and A Civil Action (1997) all follow similar paths. I wouldn't say this is the best out of all these titles, but it certainly is worth watching.",The Insider
67,frankde-jong,A realistic portrait of a whistle blower,8,22 April 2021,"Michael Mann is a director with an appetite for crime and detectives. This applies to TV (""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Miami Vice"") bit also for the cinema (""Heat"", 1995).It is therefore a little bit of a surprise that with ""The insider"" Mann makes a docudrama about the cigarette industry. This docudrama is however not about smoking being bad for your health (everybody knows that) but about the industry adding purposefully ingredients reinforcing the addicting effect of nicotine to their cigarettes. A scandal causing a huge dollar amount of claims.Main characters of the film are an investigative journalist (Lowell Bergman played by Al Pacino) and a whistle blower from the cigarette industry (Jeffrey Wigand played by Russell Crowe). Both are portrayed in a very realistic, not romanticized way.By investigative journalists we almost automatically think of Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) in ""All the president's men"" (1976, Alan J. Pakula). However Lowell Bergman is not working in an idealistic environment like the Washington Post but in a media company with the emphasis on company that is afraid of diminishing advertisment revenues (from the cigarette industry).Also whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand is not only an idealist but also a man made of flesh and blood, doubting if the cause is worth offering a promising career. In ""All the president's men"" the whistle blower (deep throat) literally remained in the dark and never became an interesting person.In the end Jeffrey Wigand not only offered his career but also his marriage. There was some criticism that the movie was women unfriendly portraying Mrs Wigand in such a disloyal way. In my opinion films are women unfriendly when they portray a woman as a sexual object only but not as they portray a woman as less then perfect.More interesting in my opinion is the role the American way of health care insurancy is playing. Losing your job can also mean losing your insurance. When you, or one of your loved ones, has health issues, this can be a big problem. It is a big problem in ""The insider"", but also in films as Glengarry Glen Ross (1992, James Foley) and ""Take shelter"" (2011, Jeff Nichols).",The Insider
68,lambiepie-2,A mature film and telling of a tale..for everyone,10,13 February 2004,"It is very hard these days to go in a pitch a film to a major studio or distributor that doesn't have loads of special effects, sex, young people having sex, the car chases, profanity. I am sure the first words out of the mouth of an executive is, ""Well, what makes this film sexy?"" That means, what puts butts in the seats and sells popcorn.Here you have a film that tells the story of a Corporate whistle blower. Not just any whistle blower, but one for big tobacco and he tells his tale on the one place Corporations don't want to have their tales exposed: The TV Newsmagazine ""60 Minutes"". Does this sound like a fun film? A film that will get the teens going in droves or adults to shell out $8.00? No. But it did.The strengths of this film is based on the performances of the characters. as well as in the pacing and telling of the tale. Being that I am not a Russell Crowe fan, he made me a fan of his work with this film. He plays the lead character, the whistle blower Dr. Wygand and makes you really feel for him, his family, his decisions. matched well is the performance of Al Pacino who plays the Journalist/Producer for 60 minutes, Lowell. Al Pacino is as equally wonderful showing how stories are developed, produced and killed..in the corporate TV world of ""60 Minutes"".""The Insider"" does one thing extremely well and it makes you an insider as you watch. You become involved in the Wygand story for sure, but you also get really involved with the workings of getting a story together for 60 Minutes and the bigger corporation, CBS. You realize getting a story together for ""60 Minutes"" isn't all that easy and even if you have a story -- the surrounding elements of competitive Journalism with Magazines and Newspapers as well as the Network you work can be a battle ground within itself.This is a look into real Journalism to tell the people of the Nation, of the World when something is endangering your life and how hard it is to get it on air, to face so much including lawsuits and jail just to tell a story -- make the public aware. This is before the ""spin"", before the ""politics"", before the looking for sexy entertainment value that has overtaken Journalism and TV today.

69,PatrynXX,One of the best movies ever made.,10,26 April 2000,"I'd say by the time this movie finished, my eyes were wet.  Whatever the facts are, this movie does a good job in pointing out the fact that when businesses own a news media, the news becomes biased.  This is where free press is blurred.  I had heard of the 60 minutes screw up in the Tv Guide years ago, but I didn't know the facts.  This movie makes you want to know more.  When this movie first came out I bi**hed only because Disney didn't let sixty minutes review it.  That's the only reason and I never let on to the fact that just because I bi**hed it didn't mean I wouldn't like the movie.  Anyone who wants to see a good movie like this should see it.

70,baumer,Michael Mann makes this slow moving film even worse,6,15 November 1999,"Oliver Stone's film ""U-turn"" was a pretty good film, when it was just that, a film.  When it became director heavy it really lacked.  What I mean by that is the technique of film became more important that than the integrity of the story.  Stone used so many silly and pretenscious shots that it took away from the experience of the movie.  That is the same with Michael Mann's The Insider.The Insider is an interesting film about an interesting topic. I'm not sure if I would invest more than 70 million dollars into it, but it is an interesting topic.  The story and the two great lead actors are the strength of the film.  But what is almost an abomination is the work done by Michael Mann.  Sometimes a film has such strength in it's script that it can survive on that alone.  Think of work by Tarantino or Kevin Smith.  They usually have material that is strong enough that you don't need a lot of camera work or an infinite number of camera movements to capture the essence of a scene. The Insider is directed like a it is made by a guy that is fresh out of film school and wants to use every technique he ever learned and that means using 25 different angles for one scene in a room.  The Insider has more close-ups and over the shoulder two shots that I can recall any movie having in quite some time.  And that became boring and cumbersome after about 15 minutes.  Whatever point was trying to be made had been done in overdrive. Close up of Crowe and his kids= he loves his kids and their life and safefy is at stake.  Close up of Crowe= he is in imminent danger.  Close up of Crowe and his wife= they are in danger and they are on shaky ground.  Close up of Pacino=  I don't know what, it could mean anything, maybe Mann is obsessed with close ups of actors.  But they were not needed in this film. I got tired of them, I didn't need to see every pore on Pacino's face, every wrinkle on Crowes forehead, every hurt expression on Crowe's wifes face magnified twenty times.  Movies have directors so that they have direction but that does not mean that I need or want to know that they are there behind the screen and off to the right of what is happening on screen.  I've always thought that a film works better when the presence of a director is not felt.  When you can look at a screen and feel like you are peering into someone else's conversation, then that is the best kind of film making. Spielberg is a master of it, Tarantino and Smith are as well and even a guy like Robert Zemekis is wonderful at doing that.  But Michael Mann seems as though he is unsure of himself as a director of films that are laden with dialogue so he compensates his ineptitude by using every shot he possibly can.  This is the biggest problem with the film, but it is not the only problem.  As interesting as the film is, in subject matter that is, it is really quite boring and slow.  There were many times that I groaned silently and wanted the film to end.  But it just kept going.  And I also felt that as good as Pacino was, he wasn't allowed to act, he was always just waiting in the background to do or say something.  The times when he was allowed to show emotion were the best parts of the film.  There is a scene in the office of 60 Minutes when Pacino is allowed to explode after his character has been told that his story is not going to air.  Here he blows and tells them how foolish they are and how much of a corporate puppet they have become and I will bet good money that when Pacino is nominated for an Oscar, when they show the clip that showcases his talents for the Oscar at the ceremony, it will be this piece that they show.  He really excells for about five minutes in this one scene.  But that's all there is, really.  The rest of the film he just sort of waits in the shadows to do anything memorable.  I don't know how you make a film like this better, with the subject matter and all, but I know one way to do it is to let Pacino loose and another way would be to get a better director.  I mean let's face it, no matter how good your subject matter is, if it is something that you can make into an A&E Special, perhaps it shouldn't be on the big screen for 150 mintues.  Overall this is an unsatisfying movie and one that I don't really think redeems itself.  I had seen Dogma the day before this, and as I stood in line, freezing on a blistery Saturday afternoon in Toronto, waiting for the Pokemon kids to get their tickets in front of me for their beloved film, I commented to the cashier that I was probably the only one seeing something else besides Pokemon.  He told me that I was probably right, except Dogma was selling out as well.  I wish I had gone to see that again.  It too was quite long ( about 2 hours in length ) but it was funny and enjoyable along with being interesting.  The Insider and Michael Mann should take lessons from Dogma and Kevin Smith.",The Insider
71,blott2319-1,"Not all that remarkable, but still well-made",6,14 December 2020,"Based on the way they set up the plot of The Insider, I was expecting more of a man-on-the-run type of story. They certainly make it seem like there's some significant danger for the main characters. I think the primary reason that I found the film a bit underwhelming was simply because it didn't feel like the stakes were as high as the movie was implying. Yes, the men involved faced severe opposition and standing up to the tobacco industry caused them great personal frustration. But it never seemed their lives were in danger. Likewise, the content of their ""groundbreaking"" story is such old news to me, and I struggle to understand why it mattered so much. Was it really that shocking to people in 1996 that cigarette corporations knew their products were life-threatening and that they actively worked to make them more addictive? I was in my late teens at that time, and I'm pretty sure that I assumed all of this was true.Despite all of my issues, when I was able to go with the flow and accept the story of The Insider as a high stakes endeavor, I found some enjoyment from it. The tone and atmosphere is excellent and offers plenty of nervous tension throughout. I appreciated the performance of Al Pacino, because he isn't over-the-top and crazy like he has become in many modern movies. I do wish they had cast someone more charismatic and interesting than Russell Crowe to play the lead role. However after watching the actual interview, it doesn't seem like Wigand is all that exciting, so perhaps Crowe was delivering the performance just right. Which brings me to my other important positive about The Insider. It was not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it did interest me enough that I made a point of seeking out the original video of WIgand's 60 Minutes interview. I suppose, for a movie based on a true story, that's a big win. The Insider might have lacked something for me, but at least I was intrigued.",The Insider
72,kevin c,BEST ACTOR,9,14 March 2000,"Although I enjoyed 'Heat', I've always felt it to be an overrated film. However, 'The Insider' is a great film, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Pacino manages to control his shouting, and give his best performance for a long time. Whilst Crowe is simply superb. You get the sense of his character's shyness, anger, tension and loneliness. I wanted Spacey to take the BEST ACTOR, but Crowe deserves it a lot more. A film with no sex, violence, action that will leave you gripped and hooked for every minute.",The Insider
73,classicalsteve,Probably the Best Expose of Comporate Greed Backed by Hollywood,10,26 January 2008,"Corporate greed is one facet of American life that is hidden often from public scrutiny. Unfortunately, many multi-billion dollar corporations are only interested in profits at the expense of Americans' health and welfare. In short, we the public pay for corporate executives' multi-million-dollar mansions, their planes, and their vacations, and we often do it without realizing what we are compromising in terms of our life. ""The Insider"", based on the real-life incidents of corporate informer Jeffrey Wigand, is one of the few American films to date that deals truthfully with the lies and corruption of American corporations.Jeffrey Wigand (played with exceptional emotionalism by Russell Crowe) was fired from the tobacco company Brown and Williamson when he could not condone the company's use of ingredients in their products to perpetuate addiction to nicotine. To add insult to injury, the corporation began threatening Wigand and his family to scare them into honoring a confidentiality agreement that basically compelled him from revealing corporate wrong-doing to the public. The film starts with the day Wigand leaves the offices of Brown and Williamson. He is then approached by Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), then one of the top journalist-producers for 60 Minutes, to analyze some documents from Philip-Morris.Bergman then discovers that Wigand has a story to tell. Wigand at first declines, using the confidentiality agreement as his reason. The film becomes how and why Wigand eventually agrees to be interviewed on camera, and the many twists and turns that occur in the process. Simultaneously, a class action lawsuit in Mississippi is brewing concerning the seven major tobacco companies, and they compel Wigand to testify there as well. Then in an interesting and unexpected twist, CBS corporate begins to pressure CBS News about withholding the Wigand story. Its reasoning: the CBS corporation was in the midst of a buy-out that would earn millions for top corporate executives that might be compromised if the there was a threat of a lawsuit from Brown and Williamson.The film is a tour-de-force triumph not only about corporate greed, but also how network corporate executives, and not journalists, are having more and more of a say on what stories are aired and what stories never leave the editing room if the corporation fears that the story is not in their best interests. The film becomes as much about an issue that is now plaguing our entire American democracy as it is about corporate consumer products: the freedom of the press to expose stories that are in the public interest as oppose to corporate interests. As a side note, the late Ed Bradly produced a story for 60 Minutes exposing President Bush's misleading the public about the War in Iraq that has not, at this writing, ever been aired.",The Insider
74,CursedChico,Enjoying the movie with great music,10,21 February 2015,"A great movie without any sex, killing, murdering scenes (except eating dead animals). This time, Al Pacino is not a fearless drug leader like Tony Montana, or not a old gangster like Carlito or not a smart, charismatic professor like Jack. He is an ambitious newspaper.In the movie, events are being processed slowly but with good music that suddenly comes, it does not matter how long it takes. The two guys, Lowell and Jeffrey; they lost everything until end but they were very brave, determined and they did not give up fighting. As Tony said in Scarface, ""All i have in this world is my balls and my word and i don't break them for no one."" In this movie, he gave a word to Jeffrey and he really did extraordinary things to keep this word and he succeeded.The scenes that i liked;Bergman is inside sea in the morning, the sea is wonderful - Bruce Mcgill's shouting the lawyer - Wigand's sitting alone in the hotel roomThe quote i liked Bergman: "" No, you ****** you!""It was good to see Crowe and Pacino in such good playing and other great actors.In the end, quitting of Lowell's was really engrossing. It summaries the main idea of movie:Trying to make the world better place is not easy and you have to really, really change your life and have to face the a lot of risks.",The Insider
75,jhclues,Compelling Drama From Michael Mann,10,29 December 2000,"Many times, the resolution to a problematic situation is seemingly as easy as simply knowing right from wrong, and acting upon it.  The sub-text of the problem, however, is often more complex; especially when the onerous decision of personal sacrifice is involved.  Such is the situation explored in `The Insider,' a powerful drama directed by Michael Mann and starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.  Based on the true story of Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a former Corporate Vice President of one of the major tobacco companies, it examines his struggle to act in accordance with his own conscience after circumstances put him together with Lowell Bergman (Pacino), a producer for Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and the highly respected television news program, `60 Minutes.'  On the surface, Wigand's conundrum seems easily dispelled; as a research scientist involved with matters of health, he has vital information concerning the addictive nature of nicotine and, moreover, the attempt by the company for which he worked to enhance the consumers propensity for it by manipulating the ingredients of their product.  Under oath (and televised on C-SPAN), the CEO's of the seven major tobacco corporations testified, to a man, that to their knowledge nicotine was not addictive; but Wigand knows otherwise.  And by claiming ignorance of the properties of nicotine, they subverted the truth even more by refuting what Wigand knew to be what they considered their real business: The delivery of nicotine to the consumer.  You put a cigarette in your mouth, you light it up, you get your fix.  Bottom line, not only do they know exactly what they're doing, they perjured themselves on national television when questioned about it.  Wigand's problem, however, is the confidentiality agreement he signed upon termination of his employment; if he talks, he loses the lucrative severance package that includes health benefits for his family.  And he has a young daughter with acute asthma.  So from his perspective, in knowing the truth about `Big Tobacco,' the question becomes one of morality:  How much does he owe, and to whom, considering the personal sacrifices he will make if he does the right thing. 	Beginning with an intelligent and well developed screenplay (by Mann and Eric Roth, adapted from the magazine article `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' by Marie Brenner), Mann meticulously presents this story of ordinary people under the stress of extraordinary circumstances in a manner that is creatively imaginative and totally engrossing; in short, a flawless delivery of a terrific script and story.  The tension begins from the moment we are introduced to Wigand and continues to build throughout the film.  There is inspired camera work (at times almost invasive, in a way that puts the viewer `in' the scene), impeccable transitions and pacing, and Mann exacts a number of brilliant performances from his actors, especially Crowe and Pacino. 	Crowe gives a detailed, Oscar worthy performance (he was nominated) as Wigand, deftly capturing the traits and attitude of this intelligent, complex individual; his volatile temperament and demanding attempt at self restraint, his forthright manner and love for his family, and the toll that coping with the demons that plague his conscience takes upon him.  Crowe has a compelling screen presence that commands the viewers attention; his expressive reactions alone convey intelligence, a sense that the `wheels are always turning,' that demands regard.  It is quite simply a remarkable character study delivered by an amazingly gifted actor whose approach to characterization is, in many ways, reminiscent of the style of Alec Guinness. 	Pacino gives a commanding performance as well; the kind of work we've come to expect from one of our greatest actors, who time and again never ceases to amaze with what he can do.  As with Crowe, his turn here is firmly planted in reality, and it's that ability to make it so real that gives such emotional impact to the drama.  And it should have garnered him a Best Actor nod as well. 	Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer, who absolutely `becomes' Mike Wallace, affecting a manner of speech and physical traits that are entirely convincing, and Diane Venora, as Wigand's wife, Liane. Also, in smaller-- but highly effective-- roles, are Michael Gambon (Thomas Sandefur) and especially Bruce McGill (Ron Motley), whose work here should have brought him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  In the final analysis, `The Insider' is a film that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; one that rings of truth beyond reproach and which aptly demonstrates how important it is to have men of principle and integrity among us.  This film is an example of cinema at it's best, and one that demands viewing by one and all.  I rate this one 10/10.",The Insider
76,CharltonBoy,One Legend and one up and coming actor come together.,8,9 January 2001,"Russell Crowe is fast gaining a great reputation as one of the top hollywood actors and his performance in THE INSIDER does nothing to dispell this. Al Pacino stars as a producer on CBS's 60 Minutes who tries to get a top executive who has just been fired from a tobbaco company to come clean on their dirty tricks which get the public hooked on the nicotene in tobbaco. Pacino , for the first time, comes up against his own bosses who are frightened about losing billions through litigation from the tobbaco company. This film is 2 and a half hours long and not for one minute did i get bored , it is totaly inthralling and more than anything it is an insight into what can and has gone on in the news reporting business.On the cover of the DVD it says""The Insider will thrill you with its unbelivable twists and turns"". i'm not sure what they are talking about there because this is hardly the sixth sense but The Insider is still a great movie. 8 out of 10.",The Insider
77,rbrb,Revealing the Truth....Nazis of the New Millennium....,10,24 August 2000,"A distinguished professional film reviewer from Chicago says this movie was more impressive than ""All the Presidents Men"" as Watergate did not kill his parents but cigarettes did. This picture is a damning indictment of corporate crime perpetrated on us all... revealing how vested business interests control, determine and decide our lives. A company cigarette executive for whatever motive knows that the ""seven dwarfs""(CEO'S) of the cigarette industry lied about knowing the true effects of smoking and that chemicals are purposely added to cigarettes to cause addiction. The human cost of revealing ""the truth"" is graphically illustrated in this brilliant movie, which is superb in every way. The main tenets in this film are true and begs the question how on earth can these drug traffickers(disquised as executives)not only get away with but prosper in their deliberate deceit and intent to harm and kill us all?? The film also importantly shows how these criminals attempt to censure the media from telling the truth. I am one of the millions of victims of cigarette addiction and this film makes it obvious to me that the scale of legalised drug trafficking in this film makes the perpetrators far worse than the Nazi's ever were.That begs the question however why do Governments allow the sale of cigarettes?? My own research knowledge reveals that from now to the year 2025 the equivalent of a shipload of Titanic passengers will die every 7 minutes from the effects of cigarette smoking. This is a ""must see"" film ..... for cigarette addicts and everyone......it is 2 hours plus of intense and compelling drama....horrifyingly based on the truth.....10 out of 10.",The Insider
78,agmoldham,Crowe's finest performance to date,8,23 December 2003,"This is a fine film and in my opinion it is Russell Crowe's finest performance to date. Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand a top scientist working for a tobacco company. The senior bosses are not pleased with Wigand and drive him out of the company and then gag him by forcing him to sign a confidentiality agreement.Bergman is a producer at 60 minutes who contacts Wigand and realises he has a story to tell. This is an emotional roller coaster for Wigand who is an ordinary person under extraordinary pressure. Having got Wigand to tell his story Bergman must then fight the corporates to get the story aired. A fine movie and it's electric when Crowe is on screen. It can't be that often that Pacino is outperformed, but he is here and it's not that his performance isn't good, it is Crowe's that's excellent. Gripping entertainment.",The Insider
79,DukeEman,The real drug pushers.,9,25 February 2003,"After his last masterpiece, HEAT, Michael Mann had enough integrity and credibility to attack the powers that be. So with this film he crosses the hot coals - lit by the drug pushing tobacco companies, multi-billion dollar corporations and the TV media - to tell the true story of Jeffrey Wigand who blows the whistle on his ex-employees about the drug induced nicotine they mass produce. 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman gets a whiff of the story and is quick on the trail. He is a man of his word that gets straight to the point and doesn't like to mess about. He may seem to be too patriotic, waving the sleazy media flag but he is not. You can label him as the last of the true media reporting heroes, a rare thing in this day and age. The other bonus Bergman has is that Pacino does a wonderful job in portraying him. You almost wonder why all the accolades are going to Crowe as the poor stressed-out Wigand. Not taking anything away from Crowe, the man is absolutely astonishing. As a viewer you do get swept into his deep ocean of paranoia and frustration. With these two performances up front there is no letting you down. What really picks up the film is the second half when all guns are out to do battle with the revelations of what goes on behind closed doors in the Corporate sector. The great thing is that there are no shoot-outs or dead bodies for dramatic effect. Reality can sometimes be fascinating! Mann's previous films were stylised, but with The Insider he knew that the script was good enough to stand on its own. So he went for the realist look where the photography of Dante Spinotti is just there to tell the story without any fancy lighting. Another technic Mann uses is the sense of paranoia. We get into Wigand's fear as the image lingers on at the end of a scene with the extras in the background becoming the focus of attention. Is one of them the tobacco thugs, spy or whatever? Or is it just me that's paranoid? This build up works perfectly for Pacino's character later in the piece when he realises what Wigand is going through. Nice to see a film not afraid to tell who the real criminals are, because these days we all just tend to shut up, bend over and take that Corporate $ firmly between the cheeks!",The Insider
80,FilmOtaku,Perfect pacing makes this a great film,9,14 July 2004,"There are very few films that last over two and a half hours that can keep my attention from waning even just a bit.  Sometimes it will just be a two second `what time is it?' check, sometimes a more involved interruption depending on the quality and pacing of the film.  `The Insider' is so well done that had I not been interrupted a couple of times, I would not have strayed from the film for even a moment.  Its perfect pacing takes it from `really good' status to `great' status.Russell Crowe is unrecognizable as Jeffrey Wigand, a middle aged, pudgy and graying former tobacco industry scientist who, after being fired for expressing an unpopular opinion of their procedures, is harassed to the point of near insanity by said company when he threatens to tell all on `60 Minutes'.  Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, a senior producer on the show who fights to get the story, then finds himself in the position of having to deal with the fact that CBS won't air the show for fear of retribution.
If this film were not a true story, it would be incredible, but the fact that it is based on true events is both mind-boggling and compelling at the same time.  Wigand is an almost Shakespearean character in that he has to make some unbelievably difficult decisions, where the results aren't going to necessarily be good for anyone, and Crowe is masterful in this role. Pacino is always good, but he is all energy and fire in this film as we see him struggle with this incredible string of events.  Michael Mann can't make a film under two and a half hours, but that isn't even a factor in this film because the pacing is perfect and without any dry moments or gaps.  The cinematography is interesting in that the lighting almost has a blue haze to it, yet it maintains its sharpness.  Unfortunately, the film has a cheesy soundtrack since Mann can't get out of the 80's, but it is a minute criticism because no film can be perfect.  Watch this film when you have a couple of hours where you are not going to be interrupted, because this is one movie that is going to hold your attention for its entirety.  With tour de force performances, a compelling plot and excellent film making, `The Insider' is a film that deserves all of the accolades it received when it was released and since.--Shelly",The Insider
81,Atreyu_II,One of the most intense movies ever made,7,5 July 2008,"I'm not big on movies about journalism, but ""The Insider"" is interesting for its genre. It is more than just a movie for those who want to learn how to be a journalist (which is not my case). It is a very intense movie. The whole movie is full of tension, which is combined with strong suspense, comparable to a thriller (except with no violence). Not the most exciting thing to watch, but definitely a powerful film which happens to be based in a real story.The big downside of this movie is its long runtime of almost 2 hours and a half, which makes it become a little tiring during the last 20 minutes. If only Michael Mann had give me the script I would have deleted 20 minutes of it and made it a shorter movie. I can't lie to you: this movie requires patience. Once you get used to it, things become more natural, but still... lots of patience is needed to watch this movie, as well as a good mood.Besides the intense story, this movie has also solid performances by the actors. For example, Al Pacino is great as usual. Russell Crowe is really good in this role, much better than in any of those which he was nominated Best Actor. Cristopher Plummer has a strong presence too. And Bruce McGill is terrific, being simply incredible when he loses his temper and shouts the line «Wipe that smirk off your face!»The soundtrack is good. The dark/noir-like atmosphere is good too. The quotes are, most of them, very good. The scenario varies a lot - it goes from exotic places/sceneries to extremely simple and sometimes crude backgrounds, but this combination doesn't work badly.The nervous and tense Jeffrey Wigand is the main character of the movie. He lives such a conflict situation that I wouldn't want to be in his skin. I wouldn't want to go through a dilemma like that.Despite being a quite dramatic and intense film, it also has its big moments of comedy. After all, even the most dramatic stories usually have their own moments of comedy.",The Insider

84,EijnarAmadeus,Stunning direction and breathtaking performances makes this one of the 90's all-time high.,10,25 January 2008,"This is a excellent movie that tells the story of Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a well-educated chemist, who decides to break his confidentiality agreement with his former tobacco company Brown & Williamson as he goes on camera doing a revealing ""60 Minutes"" interview about how cigarettes are harmful and highly addictive. With troubled Wigand leaning hard on producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino), they risk arrest for contempt of court. Now the two of them has to struggle hard against Big Tobacco's attempt to silence them and CBS' network cowardly pulling out, wanting to avoid a lawsuit.The story is brilliantly told through the different aspects of place & time, Crowe's Wigand does a sterling performance as the stolid character he portrays goes through a struggling marriage whilst he's attacked by B&W and feels manipulated by Bergman. Al Pacino is the movie's powerhouse as the former 60ties radical who's operating together with star correspondent Mike Wallace, played by a priceless Christopher Plummer. Pacino's in prime-form from the opening scene in which his appearance finds him sitting hooded in the back of a car, cruising in the crowded streets of any Iranian city to the final finish in which he leaves the 60-Minutes behind, stepping out of his lifelong workplace.And it's that fore-mentioned opening scene that's one of the movie's most fascinating moments; Bergman deals out an exclusive interview with a sheik, later Wallace steps in to do the actual interview when he's strictly order to move away from the sheik. Wallace gets up from his chair, and out-manages the armed soldier with ""Do you think I'm an 78-year old assassin who's gonna kill him with my notes?"", there's tension in the room as Bergman steps in and asks his companion Wallace if he's ""through fu**ing around?"". And when the interview starts Wallace asks ""Do you know that everyone in America thinks you're a terrorist?"" - it's a killer scene and stays with you through the whole movie. It's showcasing of great television, it's a startling interview by the very first question, and 60-Minutes becomes a great show because it tells the truth- but with Wigand and Bergman's case about tobacco, 60-Minutes and CBS executives won't air the original interview, they're gonna need a sanitized, alternate version of it. Now Bergman rages at Wallace for going along with 60-Minutes head-chief Hewitt, and there-by Wigand rages at Bergman for feeling left out and manipulated, he didn't count on pressures that would break his marriage and death threats. And Wigand is a isolated hero who's kept quiet about for years about Big Tobacco, how he acts like a ticking bomb as his frustration and anger boils over as the purring B&W boss threats him if he doesn't agree on a further and tougher confidentiality pact.This is 2 hours and 30-something minutes of talking, about how truth gets compromised in the America. As Bergman says; he gets the interview, he makes him break his confidentiality pact, he tells the truth, he shoots it but are they gonna air it? No. Wallace backs at at the age of 78, wanting to be remembered for that the last thing he did wasn't to tear down CBS to pieces, loosing his job and respect. Bergman on the other hand is as Hewitt calls him an anarchist; standing at the beach talking with Wigand on the phone he realizes that the system's not there to back him up anymore, he's taken this case too far for anybody in CBS to back him up, he's on his own - and when his wife says ""You won"", he can't feel reluctant to ask what did he win. CBS finally agrees to air the original interview, as Wallace walks over to him and asks about their next project together - Bergman looks at him and says ""What got broken here doesn't go back together again"". This is Micheal Mann at his best, a provoking drama that's one of the best movies the 90ties ever made.",The Insider
85,RonellSowes,Overly long film that fails to escalate,5,14 November 2020,"The Insider was the first of three films Russell Crowe was consecutively nominated for an Academy Award. He received the Best Actor Oscar the following year for Gladiator. Russell Crowe was thirty four when he played the role,eighteen years younger than the real Jefferey Wigand. A grey haired wig and some makeup was used to make him appear older but it really looks like a younger man wearing a wig. He still is a talented actor and delivers with a meritorious performance.This film starts off on a prosepectible trajectory but it quickly evaporates. This film doesn't progress or escalate and merely circles about. It doesn't sail forward but drifts sideways. Initially the plot is more centered on Wigand and his family. However,as it continues its focus centers on Al Pacino's character and his conflict with CBS and Brown & Williamson. As a matter of fact, towards the end you start looking back and wonder if that was the same movie.Wigand's whistleblowing lead to lawsuits of hundreds of billions of dollars and the way governments view the tobbacco industry.

86,RanchoTuVu,big tobacco,10,10 September 2006,"A long but good enough to keep one watching movie detailing a surprising true story about ""Big"" tobacco and their responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of smokers. Equally interesting is the CBS ""60 Minutes"" episode where they lost their nerve and pulled an interview they had taped rather than face a lawsuit. It's a classic battle between their legal office and the news people, reminding one of the later film ""Good Night and Good Luck"" about Edward R. Murrow, whose spirit and legacy aren't easy to live up to. Tying it together is the nice characterizations and sharp writing, making this movie, if not a thriller, than very close to it. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino are at the forefront, but Christopher Plummer is right up there, playing CBS' Mike Wallace. The movie ingeniously ties together the tobacco story, a very good drama about the power of corporate giants. You keep waiting for the violence to start, but it stays concealed under a tight, well coordinated effort to destroy the whistle-blower, the character assassination that's more effective and damaging than the use of physical violence. The deposition scene in a Mississippi office is one of the best dramatized legal showdowns in a long time. Mississippi, like so many other states, was faced with the costs of caring for all those sick smokers and was at the forefront of going after the big companies to seek reimbursement. How a movie can make a technical legal battle so interesting is a tribute to director Michael Mann and this, perhaps his best film so far.

Superior dialogue and terrific performances. **** (out of four).",9,21 March 2001,"THE INSIDER / (1999) **** (out of""The Insider"" prospers in almost every way, shape, and form possible. The production is a masterpiece of visual style, moving performances, and penetrating dialogue. The story is captivating, even at 157 minutes. There is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention throughout-and at a consistent pace. Many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue, but not ""The Insider."" This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking. It is also believable and entirely convincing. There is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information. It is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time, always at the perfect second.Russell Crowe's character is the heart of the film, one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-employee at Brown & Williamson, one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers. Its chairman (Michael Gambon) has fired Wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business routines-but not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls. When the company even further jeopardizes his existence, he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of B&W.He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program ""60 Minutes,"" receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company. Bergman contacts Wigand, aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential ""60 Minutes"" show. Bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of Wigand, therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at B&W so concerned.The film makes many unexpected turns; in the second half, it smartly switches focus from Wigand to Bergman. After losing his privacy, secrets, reputation, and family, Wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry. But Bergman faces further complications. His TV Network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break Wigand's confidentiality agreement.""You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own f*****g confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets,"" explains Bergman.The dialogue is one of the brightest, most thought-provoking material in the film. All of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured, the stuttering, the spontaneous explicit declaratives, and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character's personalities (Agent: Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand? Wigand: Yes. Yes, I do. I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).The movie's dramatic premise is so clear, so precise, so uncommonly absorbing. It expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters. There is also an excellent introduction of both Wigand and Bergman, giving them depth and human dimension. Despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree, I extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones.Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance. Crowe is worthy of his Oscar nomination for best actor; he delivers a performance of great subbtlness, but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power. He captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character, making his scenes involving, subversive, and taut.Michael Mann is the film's director, who also directed the 1995 thriller ""Heat"" starring Val Kilmer, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions. Mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography, taking the view of the character, and close up shots.""The Insider"" inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television, reputation, honesty, and so forth. The biggest ethic I think Mann is trying to get across is of modern morality: always do the right thing, follow you conscience, no matter what the cost. Then there's the film's most provoking issue: ""Fame has a fifteen-minute half-life. Infamy lasts a little longer.""",The Insider
91,alice liddell,"Much of this is excellent, and yet...",5,15 March 2000,"I hope I can say this under IMDb guidelines, but THE INSIDER is a little disappointing after the mighty HEAT.  It's not that it's a bad film  - on the contrary, it's a rare Hollywood film that treats its subject with seriousness, irony and complexity.  Unfortunately, it shares the classical epic's delusion that somehow length confers greater worthiness, and so we get a lot of dragged out scenes of people just staring, which perhaps gives a truer sense of what it must be like for ordinary people in such circumstacnes - the sheer tedious dread - but dissipates, in contradiction of the closing credits, the film's 'dramatic effect'.In many ways similar to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (as has been pointed out) - an investigation into 'respectable' corruption (in this case the Columbia-like addiction-mongering of tobacco companies) - it is also that film's complete opposite.  Whatever its flaws, Pakula's film was shaped as a thriller, had the exciting momentum of a thriller, the driving sense of two detective figures bringing enlightenment to a depressingly murky situation.
There was always a large element of wish-fulfilment about this.  For a start, the case had already been won, the film felt like retreading old victories.  But most seriously, the shadowy Establishment network that allowed Watergate to happen was never punctured - Nixon was a scapegoat, things were allowed to get back to normal.  This is half-suggested in Pakula's tireless determination to make a conspiracy thriller out of everything, but the essential American faith in right and truth outing was generally asserted.Michael Mann is too good a director to settle for this.  His film does follow a feel-good arc - revelation of corruption, suppression of revelation, eventual revelation of revelation - which suggests that men of truth and honour can defeat proto-fascist corporate power.  And there is, like THREE KINGS, a sense that audiences wouldn't be able to handle a more realistic ending.But Mann ironises this arc at every turn.  His hero is Lowell Bergman, a CBS news producer with a reputation for securing great stories in some of the world's most dangerous hot-spots.  He is played by Al Pacino, an actor in the grandstanding manner, who, despite many villainous roles, carries with him a dogged, Spencer Tracy-like integrity.  In following his point-of-view, we get to see the development of the plot and the workings of corporate power.In the opening sequecne, as Bergman is being driven through Iran, we see what he sees - when he looks in a particular direction, the camera follows. The thing is, he doesn't see anything, he is blindfolded - the traditional treatment to the Hollywood hero has been brilliantly subverted, and undermines Bergman as a hero thorughout the film.For instance, when Bergman, trying to persuade Wigand to talk, suggest, idealistically, information is power at a Japanese restaurant.  Mann frames the two men sitting in the traditional Japanese manner, almost legless, not looking very powerful at all.So in a film where there is an awful  lot of talk adn exposition, it is crucial that Mann's irony gives us, the audience, the real view, as in that first sequence.  A recurrent motif is Bergman standing godlike from a balcony looking out over a huge city - he does not survey all he sees; it's an impenetrable blank to him.  Just as the plot slips away from him, he talks to Wigand on the phone on a beach- Mann cuts to him wading in the water like King Canute.  This subtle ironising makes it all the more credible when this blustering hero, totally in control, driving the plot with ariculate confidence, is suddenly shown to have very little real power at all.Wigand isn't ironised in quite the same way - he is in a more passive position, defending his family, repository of information.  BUt his introduction also shows how removed he is from the real world.  WE see him first in his office which looks onto a staff canteen - the realms are only separated by a glass wall, but they could be two different worlds - his dark, lonely,furtive, suffocating, sinister (we don't know what he's doing, but it looks very secretive), dislocatingly cut with the friendly, communal, human babble of the canteen.  WHen he goes to leave the building, the camera slows down, the sound is blocked out, the light brightens, adn Wigand looks like he's entering a dream or fairytale world.THis ironising is crucial, because the film takes on a feel-good turn.  At first it suggest taht truth can be recorded, delivered to the public, despite the flexing of corporate muscle.  When this threatens , there are alternative means of diffusion.  BUt look  at thow Wigand's testimony is recorded.  We see the testimony split into different screens, teh 'real' Wigand and his screen image.  Lter we see Bergman editing the piece, rearranging the truth to achieve it more powerfully.  There is no such thing as an unmediated 'pure' truth, and although this might seem rather obvious, it sours the heric sense of the truth finally getting out to the public. Also disturbing is the possiblity, that never actually occured to me until the smear attacks, that Wigand might be lying.  WE are given no evidence adn are expected to take this man's word.  THE idea of anyone's 'word' being simply enough is so rejected by the film that itt further undermines the optimistic intentions, and this is never resolved withing the film.  Is there somehow an abstract 'truth' thast can be extracted from the deeply compromised eople that utter it?All this is great - and there are some interesting insights about families (although not, as ever with MANN, women) adn imiplications about the wider sphere of political and media corruptoin - but the film is too subversive for its own good.  It undermines its heroes, its themes, its genre, its mode of representation, its setting.  THis is all necessary adn brilliant, but it doesn't leave much for a film, certainly at this lentgh.  Unlike ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - a film about actively seeking a well-defined truth - THE INSIDER is about defending a compromised truth - and this passivity means that it can never work as a thriller - you keep waiting for something to happen adn it doesn't.  It can't.",The Insider
92,FlickJunkie-2,Gripping reality based drama,9,15 April 2000,"This is a dramatic triumph; a gripping story of the battle between truth and corruption in the sacred halls of mass media news.  Based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, the research scientist from Brown and Williamson Tobacco who blows the whistle on the industry's attempts to chemically enhance the addictive effects of nicotine, this story grabs you like an anaconda and slowly squeezes you until you are out of breath.The plot follows Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes, as he first stumbles across Wigand (Russell Crowe), convinces him to do an interview and then battles to get the interview aired after Brown and Williamson threatens CBS with a lawsuit.  This is reality based drama at its finest.  For once, we have a real story that is not rendered dubious by over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in frequency he more than delivers in quality.  I liked all aspects of his direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to maximize effect.  If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur, it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene.  He uses technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic, especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a relevant message.  He provides well defined characters that hook the audience emotionally.   His pace is always appropriate with moments of frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in this film was uniformly excellent.  Pacino is at his finest in this role.  It is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'.  As in `Heat', I believe that Mann has again brought forth Pacino's maximum dynamism and squeezed out of him every bit of his brilliance.Russell Crowe elevated his game to a new level with this film.  Though I found his performance a bit uneven, he brought great power to the role (perhaps a bit too much), and transcended his previous best performance in `LA Confidential' by a wide margin.   This was a complex and difficult character,  reserved and intellectual yet highly emotional and explosive. This is a combination that doesn't usually come in the same package.  Crowe nailed the reserved intellectual part, but was overwrought in the angry scenes, coming across more like an action hero than the incensed nerd he was supposed to be playing.  However, this is a picayune criticism of what was on the whole a fabulous performance.This is one of the better dramas I have seen in a while.  I rated it a 9/10.

96,khatcher-2,Excuse me while I put out my cigarette,7,28 September 2002,"Interesting quasi docu-drama investigation, well played out by the principal actors; not without the usual doses of tremendism, this film narrates how a sacked cigarette-company worker and a CBS newsreporter manage to bring the big tobacco companies to justice. Lots of tense moments and the usual clashes among all those participating, as to be expected in any kind of US-type drama film. The Pacino/Crowe/Plummer trio is pretty fine, and the rest of the cast carry out their duties adequately.However, mostly due to the complex nature of the film's subject matter a lot of the would-be impact message gets lost on the way: tobacco kills; cigarettes can cause all kinds of cancer  but this is mostly due to all kinds of chemicals added to the nicotine by the cigarette manufacturers. The original cigarette, as found among South American Indians and brought back to Europe were as harmless as hashish, precisely because in both cases the product was purely natural.An interesting film quite intelligently put together. Unfortunately I began smoking when there were no warnings like `cigarettes are harmful to your health' nor any other kind of anti-tobacco social feeling. Excuse me while I put out my cigarette.Now, where was I? Oh, yes: I've just been a couple of months in the dear old U.K. for the first time in 22 years. What a surprise!

97,RossRivero99,One of 1999's very best films,10,16 May 2015,"Michael Mann's The Insider is one the best films that Michael Mann has ever done along with Heat (1995), Collateral (2004), and Public Enemies (2009). The movie tells the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in an Oscar nominated performance)who used to work as a tobacco scientist who ended up getting fired and whistle-blowing what has been going with his former workplace to ""60 Minutes"" news anchor Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer)amid receiving death threats along with his family and trying to get protected by the producer of ""60 Minutes"" named Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino). this was the first film that Pacino did for Mann after working on Heat (1995) four years earlier, everything about this film is just flawless especially when it comes to the amazingly good performances from Al Pacino, Russell Crowe,Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, and Diane Venora as Jeffrey's wife (later ex-wife). Mann's and Eric Roth's script, along with Mann's directorship and Dante Spinotti's photography are just excellent, and as a result the movie got 7 Oscar nominations including Best Picture , Best Actor for Russell Crowe, and Best Director for Michael Mann. Which are few reasons why I think that it is a great film as well as the emotional range of the Russell Crowe performance which made me empathize with what he was going through throughout the course of the entire film.",The Insider
98,Eumenides_0,Beautiful Portrait Of The Human Condition,10,20 February 2005,"Michael Mann has made one of my favorite modern movies: The Insider is everything I expect to find in a movie. Time has not treated it well, it was completely overlooked at the Oscars and has been sadly forgotten in recent years in detriment of more catchy 1999 movies like American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, and Being John Malkovich. I don't understand why: The Insider is a masterpiece with great production values and quality; its screenplay is engaging, it depicts the human condition with intelligence, maturity and tenderness; one can feel Jeffrey Wigand's frustrations and anger, cry over his personal problems, rejoice in his battle for the truth against tobacco companies; he's one of the most complex and complete characters because of the way Mann balances his feelings with his many flaws; he's not perfect, but for his sacrifices and losses throughout the movie, I believe he's one of the best heroes in recent American Cinema, of the same stuff Atticus Finch and Will Kane are made of.Mann's great achievement is picking up a slice of life and turning it engaging: Jeffrey Wigand, former CEO for tobacco company fights for the public's right to know the truth about this industry. It seems rather dull, but Mann focuses on the everyday consequences of his actions, marital arguments, divorce, restraining orders, possibly jail. The Insider really shows ordinary people caught up and left alone in cruel, extraordinary situations and that makes great drama to watch! I find fascinating how far the tobacco companies will go to stop Jeffrey from saying what he knows, the threats to his family, the psychological blackmail; CBS's fear of airing his interview is their last gambit and it was fascinating to watch the backstage functioning of a big network, the discussions between the top people that the common man is unaware of, their daily fear of litigations, and the efforts of good journalists like Lowell Bergman to show the truth.Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, a man torn between exposing the truth and keeping his mouth shut to protect his family and their well-being; it's not even physical aggression he fears, more things that are in most people's minds: how will he pay the mortgage on the cars and house, who will put food on their table, how will they pay college? Jeffrey's a high-middle class guy and his greatest fear is how his actions will hurt his family economically. It's something many people can relate with. Crowe is brilliant in this role, to me it's his best one to date; without many words he manages to convey several feelings and emotional states just through body language, facial expressions and small mannerisms and ticks. He never tells directly what's on his mind, but he shows it with great clarity. Jeffrey's major flaw is his lack of social skills to deal with emotional situations; he's always hot-headed and gets angry easily, and his failure to communicate with his wife, Liane, when she's not coping so well with his problems, lead to abandon and divorce. Diane Venora is great at playing Liane, it's easy to find her rather cold and uncaring for the way she abandons Jeffrey, but I think her character was well-written as a wife who tried to stand alongside her husband, only he didn't want her support: Jeffrey had it coming on this one.Al Pacino is also fantastic as Lowell Bergman, a 60 Minutes journalist who fights against CBS to air his interview with Jeffrey so his efforts and personal tragedies weren't in vain. Pacino steals the last third of the movie in this quest, overshadowing Crowe's performance. I feel he should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his strong performance. The movie's climax is beautiful, and one of the most cathartic moments in cinema since Andy Dufresne's escape in The Shawshank Redemption. I love the song 'Sacrifice' playing while the interview is finally being aired as the camera keeps cutting to several characters in the movie as they all watch it on TV. It's a feel-goody moment because everyone wants Jeffrey's efforts to be worthwhile and not just in vain. More importantly, being it based on a true story, it's not just mindless happy ending to please crowds: it's the truth, and it should remind all these people who hate happy endings because they're 'unrealistic' that, yes, there are happy endings in the real world too! The music is beautiful in this movie  I love 'Iguazu' playing when Jeffrey is on his way to a court to testify against the tobacco companies. 'Meltdown' is another beautiful song. Mann is a great filmmaker: his use of camera angles is always refreshing and his cinematography is just visually engaging. The Insider, to me, deserved to have swept several Oscars: Best Picture, Director and Actor. I'm not sure about Best Adapted Screenplay, The Talented Mr. Ripley had a best one in my opinion. As things stand, both movies were ignored in 1999 by the Academy. It's something I regret but changes nothing to me: The Insider will always remain as the best movie of 1999 to me.",The Insider

I love Michael Mann and most of his films. Heat, to be my favorite of his films, opened up in 1995. Four years later Mann opens up with a new film called The Insider. The top cast is Al Pacino who starred in Heat, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, and Phillip Baker Hall. The movie was beyond interesting and had such good dialogue, it wasn't even funny. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe had ground breaking performances and brought a lot of intensity to the movie, which I praise highly. The movie is very interesting but for a 2 hour and 38 minute film, a lot of people could lose their interest into it and be in boredom which I unlikely entered. I liked the movie and it wasn't t bad at all but the film needed more energy if it wants to please everyone.

100,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: disappointing, low-key",8,13 April 2002,"I'm an action movie guy and I like thrillers. Plus, in tune with the culture in Massachusetts, USA, where smoking was banned in workplaces earlier than most regions, I was looking forward to enjoying ""The Insider"", which sticks it to the evil cigarette industry.However, ""The Insider"" is based on a true story, which means that the script writers are not at liberty to spice up the plot. They can't, for example, throw in an extra car chase whenever they like.So the film sort-of bored me. The acting by can't-fail actors Al Pacino and Russell Crowe was great, but this wasn't ""The Firm"", and lives weren't really at stake here. Without giving away the plot, mostly it's a legal battle where Al Pacino (the journalist) has to convince Russell Crowe (the Insider) to endanger his career.OK, he might endanger his career. So what? That's worth a movie? That's bravery? I know, I know, the film is really about Pacino's character as the protagonist, not Crowe's, but it still didn't work for me and I found it a little boring.Who should see this film:-- Arty film types, you'll probably appreciate more than I did-- Anti-smoking types who can't help themselves-- Action / thriller movie buffs, but only on a rainy daywhen you've got nothing better to do, and only if you don'tneed stuff to blow up constantly to enjoy a filmI give ""The Insider"" a disappointing 5 out of 10.

101,policy134,Mann directs his most accomplished movie and to this day it is the most unique.,8,29 March 2005,"Few screenwriters could have come up with a better idea for a fictitious movie than this fact-based drama. Excellent performances laced with a splendid editing job that makes the film all the more alive and exciting. Plus the musical score is truly unique.Russell Crowe, in his first Oscar-nominated role gives a very low key performance reminiscent of his work in L.A. Confidential. Not that those two movies were anywhere near similar, but Crowe has a way of understatement in both films that is rare for an actor today. To compare, look at Al Pacino's performance. He has the flashy role of the TV-producer and boy, does he ever take advantage of it. The only times when he shows near restraint is in his scenes with Crowe. The scenes they share also has some touching moments and Pacino has never been more likable. The one thing that Pacino totally nails is the opening scene where he interviews the Arab (I forget what he is). You believe that he really is a news producer in the way the scene is set up and the way Pacino plays it.There are many more familiar faces throughout, but the one who truly made an impression is Bruce McGill in the rather small role of Wigand's attorney. The way he comes off as a good IL' boy when interviewing Wigand and the way he turns it around is pure gold. There are other small roles throughout by good actors like Debi Mazar, Stephen Tobolowsky and even a cameo by one of the real live persons who was involved in the case. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace does a good job but somehow he comes off as a bit of an oath. We never see why he was such a good host on 60 minutes.One thing I think was a bit disappointing was the way the focus shifted from Wigand to Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman. By the end I had enough of Pacino's turn as the wronged producer who turns it all around in his favor. In one scene we see Wigand at a job interview for a teacher position but we don't see why the principal, who had doubts hiring him, changed her mind. We also are denied a closing scene of how Wigand reacted when the piece of his interview finally aired in it's full form. Those are minor quibbles though, as I think that Mann keeps the integrity of the story on a high level through most of the film and it was a shame that it was so snubbed by the Academy but a little thing called American Beauty was apparently more attractive at that time.",The Insider

Michael Mann clearly could have, and should have, shorten the duration of a good thirty minutes because the action is completely diluted and the plot drags and drags on especially in the last half hour where everything seems to be stuck. Moreover, the big revelation supposed to be exposed is that tobacco is bad for your health, something so evident these days that this story seems completely absurd.

103,SKG-2,Stinging indictment,10,8 November 1999,"Before I start, I should declare my bias up front; I have never understood the appeal of smoking.  Granted, I didn't grow up during the time when it was made to look cool in the movies, but I don't think it looks glamorous or stylish or any of that.  I can understand how some people will drink too much in that many alcoholic beverages actually taste good(I hope no one sees this as an endorsement of alcoholism, because it isn't), but cigarettes don't even taste good; it's just smoke.  I've always liked this routine I once heard where a comedian talked about smokers and their attitudes:""Smoking doesn't affect me, I can still exercise,"" they say.  Then you walk up a flight of stairs with them, and all of a sudden they turn into Darth Vader(heavy breathing).  Meanwhile, there's Yoda on the railing going, ""Stunt your growth, it will.""All that is to say I was predisposed to liking THE INSIDER before I even saw it, since it goes after the tobacco industry(anybody who thinks legalized drugs would improve things should consider how the tobacco industry has handled its own legalized drug).  But if that was all it did, it wouldn't be a complete movie.  Instead, THE INSIDER, and Michael Mann, also make this an indictment of the news industry, which is more concerned with industry than news, and a complex character study of two men.Admittedly, there are a few facts fudged here.  The most surprising thing is an omission; I'm not entirely clear on this, but wasn't one of the CBS executives related to someone at Brown & Williamson?  Also, while it's not true the movie gives credit to Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) for manipulating a Wall Street Journal story(he merely gives them the other side of the story they were about to print), it doesn't give the paper enough credit for its own investigation(as Bergman in the movie points out, the Journal is not exactly known for going after big corporations).Still, this is a powerful movie.  One thing, as I said before, which makes it powerful is how it also goes after CBS, and in particular CBS News, for caving in to the possibility of a lawsuit(not a lawsuit, just the possibility of one).  And while Mike Wallace has criticized the film(though he has retracted that somewhat), the fact of the matter is if he had made a stink about it, CBS might not have caved in so easily.  And yet the film doesn't portray him as a bad guy, just someone who doesn't know if he has the fight left in him.And as a character study, of course, it's riveting.  Some people think this film is a departure for Mann from his usual crime dramas.  But Mann has also made films about flawed heroes(MANHUNTER, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS), which Jeffrey Wigand certainly is, and like the characters in Mann's more famous films(THIEF, HEAT), Wigand is a man good at his job, but not good at expressing his feelings, and backed into a stand he didn't know he was going to have to take.  Russell Crowe has not always played characters with simmering intensity(think of PROOF, THE SUM OF US, or THE QUICK AND THE DEAD), but as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL showed, he's masterful at playing them, and shows it again here.  He walks like a man defeated at the beginning, when he's fired, and you can feel the longing he has just for things to be normal again.  But you can also see the intelligence and the man who refuses to be pushed around by anybody, whether it be the tobacco company or Bergman. Pacino is also quite good as Bergman, playing not a hero, but someone who also is pushed into a stand he didn't think he'd have to take.Oh yeah, and as usual for a Mann film, this looks incredible.  Just as ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN(which this is being compared to) director Alan J. Pakula and cameraman Gordon Willis was able to visualize the creepiness of Watergate, here Mann and his cameraman, Dante Spinotti, emphasize how there's no black and white here by showing the gray areas visually.  All in all, this is a great film.",The Insider
104,chaswe-28402,"Overwrought, overworked, moody, complicated, confusing",6,23 September 2017,"There are basically two interlinked stories here. One is about Mike Wallace a charismatic television personality, who caved in to corporate power. The other is the story of Jeff Wigand, a bumbling character who was persuaded to take on a company I'd never heard of called Brown & Williamson, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco. He eventually succeeded in changing the public's perceptions of the effects of smoking. Although the public may have been quite aware of those effects already. Crowe looks a bit like Wigand, and Plummer looks quite like Wallace. Pacino, who played the persuader, Lowell Bergman, a reporter, doesn't look like him. It seems that Crowe spent a lot of time with Wigand so that he could imitate him in the film. Bergman has said that the film was emotionally, politically and, in general, dead-on accurate. He terminally fell out with Wallace.Wallace is said to have hated this portrayal of him. But the force of corporate power is a given. Not many are as resolute as, say, Thomas More. It's an extremely unusual man who stands up to corporate pressure.However, the question I was left asking myself was: How addictive is nicotine, and: is it the nicotine which harms the body, or is it the smoke of the tobacco leaves ? I used to be a fairly heavy smoker – 30 or 35 cigarettes a day; but gave up on 16 November 2010 and have only smoked about 15 cigarettes since, after finding them lying around the house. I think it's more of a habit than an addiction. The film is too long.",The Insider

This only goes to say that this film really has to be good. It also goes to show that the best movies are almost always based on true stories. Truth always trumps fiction.This movie was very well directed and well filmed, but above all it was well acted. Both Crowe and Pacino deliver memorable, believable performances, creating characters for which we can feel for, with whom we can identify.

Of course, the day before I was to see it they took it down in my town. Just my luck. Luckily, I got a second chance now when it is out on video. Michael Mann's  ""Heat"" is a great action film, this film is certainly nothing like it. Well, apart from the great' thing, because ""The Insider"" is a great film. Of course, like most films it should have been made shorter, 2.5 hours is just too long.

With The Insider, he hascrafted a suspenseful, and very entertaining drama.  Al Pacinoand Russel Crowe are great in their roles, but most of thecredit goes to Crowe.  He pretty much vanishes into the role ofJeffrey Wigand.  You can also look into his eyes and see whathell he is going through.  Pacino is good as always, andChristopher Plummer is perfectly cast as the imposing MikeWallace.  A truly riveting film that will nail you to your seatuntil the very end.",The Insider
109,moviemanMA,Crowe and Pacino are magnificent!,9,30 July 2005,"Whenever someone hears about the big tobacco industries, they think big money and not to be meddled with. But in 1994, one man changed all that. One man stood up to this giants of industry and told them off. In 1999, director Michael Mann retold this story in grade A fashion.The Insider deals with the CBS 60 Minutes special involving the tobacco company Brown & Williams and their former researcher Dr. Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe). 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) will go to great lengths to get this man to talk about his work with the company. What he has to get around is the confidentiality agreement that Wigand signed. Now that he has been fired for a bogus reason, he wants to get back at the company that now threatens his family. Bergman tries to bend the rules and go around every corner to get this man to testify in a court of law so that his testament will not be liable with the confidentiality agreement.With B&W watching every move that Wigand makes and checking everything that has happened to him from birth up to this point in time, Wigand is ready to do anything. Before he even appearers in court, he records an interview with 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). This interview may not go on the air at all if certain things aren't made right. What Bergman must do now is protect Wigand and still air this special without causing any trouble because he knows that this will be the biggest case in US history.Crowe and Pacino both give breathtaking performances. Crowe was nominated for his portrayal of Wigand and was well deserved. Wigand is an interesting character. He has to make the right choices without hurting his reputation, his family, and without breaking the deal with his former company. The decisions he makes are both life changing and have an impact on those around him. Pacino as Bergman is the perfect fit. He is an explosive actor and very passionate with his work. His work in this movie is incredible. He combines a soft heart with a hard-nose attitude that gives him a very powerful presence. These two men are great and even Plummer as Wallace gives a great performance. His character is both working for the people so they are informed, and working for CBS, making sure they don't go under with this story. All together, there is a great cast with smaller parts even shinning, especially Bruce McGill as Ron Motley, one of the lawyers working with Wigand.The Insider is a must see. This political thriller is a great watch and showcases two of today's top actors doing what they do best. Director Michael Mann is no stranger when it comes to good movies. His hits like The Last of the Mohicans(1992), Heat (1995), Ali(2001), and most recently Collateral(2004). The Insider is one of his best films to date. The Insider is a great film...and that's the truth.",The Insider
110,dead47548,Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure.,10,4 December 2007,"Sitting in a lush New York restaurant, Liane Wigand (Diane Venora) gets up and leaves the table in a reserved fit of anger after learning that her husband, Jeffrey (Russell Crowe) is going to record a taping the next day for 60 Minutes where he plans to expose the tobacco industry and their web of lies the next day. After she storms off, Jeffrey whom admittedly has a bit of a drinking problem, quietly stands up and marches over to the bar. Remaining at the table, the show's host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) gleefully stares across at his producer, Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and asks with a grin on his face ""Who are these people?"" Lowell's answer perfectly describes what Michael Mann's visceral, subtle thriller is all about. In one sentence, he summarizes the entire plot and in that shows the genius of how Michael Mann could take something so minimal and make it so extraordinary. Lowell quickly answers ""Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure, Mike."" The Insider focuses primarily on Jeffrey and Lowell, two characters who start in very different places and collide to eventually make drastic changes in each other's lives and the fate of our nation as a whole and it's stand on the tobacco industry. The film opens with Lowell in Israel, blindfolded being taken to a meeting with a reported terrorist whom he convinces to conduct an interview with Mike Wallace for the show. Across the globe in Louisville, Kentucky we are introduced to Jeffrey Wigand as he's walking away from his office for the last time after being fired for what his employer called ""communication problems"" but he knows that it was because he was no longer comfortable with what they were doing; lying to the public in order to get them to continue to buy their products while being completely unaware of the consequences. He watched the Seven Dwarfs (the seven CEOs of Big Tobacco) lie under oath, saying that nicotine wasn't addictive, and he was no longer comfortable with it so they let him go and made him sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose any knowledge he gained while working for Brown & Williamson. Jeffrey had every intention to go home, find a new job and honor this agreement with no exception.As is generally the case with Mann, he quickly (but thoroughly) introduces us to the main characters without wasting half of the running time just to give us the basic background of the characters like the majority of films inevitably do. Mann has a gift for showing us one scene for each main character (in this case, the two leading men) that allows us to understand their entire personality and leaves the vast majority of screen time for the actual story to present itself instead of spending so much time on introducing the characters that the story is left to be bunched together in a flimsy package in the last half hour. After the strong introductions to the characters, we see a typical morning for Lowell Bergman. On the phone every second with his wife answering the other calls, he barely says goodbye to his two children as the eldest informs him that there's a package on the porch for him. When he finally gets around to opening this anonymous delivery and realizes that he's going to need a consultant in order to translate the documents into words he can understand. Through a network of communications, he's connected with Jeffrey Wigand who agrees to help him but refuses to do anything that would breach his confidentiality agreement.That is, until Brown & Williamson make a grave mistake. After hearing that Jeffrey has spoken with Lowell, they bring him back in and ask him to sign another agreement that ""more thoroughly defines what confidential is"". After some poorly chosen words by the company's CEO Thomas Sandefur (Michael Gambon), Wigand becomes infuriated and gets the impression that the company is threatening not only his life but also the life of his family. He doesn't sign the paper, storms out of the office and immediately calls Lowell, thus embarking them on the journey that will vastly change both of their lives. Wigand goes through an emotional roller-coaster in order to do what he knows is the right thing by exposing Big Tobacco for the frauds that they are. His family is threatened and eventually leaves him, his paranoia reaches several breaking points and his life is ultimately destroyed by his decision to come forward; through all of this, he still firmly believes that it's worth it. He becomes a martyr in order to expose the lies of Big Tobacco, and Lowell guides him through this crusade. Through Lowell we are given an inside look into the new industry and we see very raised emotions that explode, Network-esquire, including one particularly stunning scene where Mike Wallace scolds ""corporate lackey"" Helen Caperelli (Gina Gershon) for cutting the guts out of a controversial statement he made.Just like Network, The Insider's sensational story of corruption and the web of the media is hinged on numerous brilliant performances. Russell Crowe gives possibly the finest performance of the entire decade. His subtle portrayal of Wigand's paranoia and indecisiveness is stunning, but what's even more brilliant is the actor's ability to display all of the bottled up rage and fear that Wigand had bound up inside of him. The few scenes where these emotions explode are some of the most emotionally draining experiences I've ever witnessed on film. Though Crowe is definitely the shining point of the acting ensemble, the rest of the cast also excels (primarily Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora). Mann's direction is truly ingenious, as it always is. His style is beautifully unique and smooth and he manages to create a visceral, highly engaging film unlike any I've ever seen. In the end, The Insider is an impeccable character study of ""ordinary people under extraordinary pressure"".",The Insider
111,Rammstein-2,Brilliantly filmed and acted,10,13 November 2000,"This film was breathtaking. Michael Mann is responsible for my favorite movie of all time, ""Heat"", and there are some similarities in the ""poetic visual language"" that he has mastered fully.The performances are amazing, both Crowe and Pacino are immersed in their characters and make them so real and alive that one hardly thinks of them as actors in a movie.But what really makes this film excellent is the filming. It is beautiful, alive and vibrant. The images convey the sadness, fear, frustration and anger that the leads are experiencing. Fantastic. I can't wait for Mann's next masterpiece.By the way, the music one hears when Wigand discovers the agents in and around the house (that later reveals themselves as his bodyguards), and rushes towards his house is music from ""Heat"". In that movie, it is played when Shiherlis (Kilmer) drives away from his wife, presumably forever.",The Insider

113,trpdean,"Poor one-sided melodrama - much heat, little light",1,4 February 2002,"Caution: Contains spoilersI disliked this movie. Generally, I found it boring - and yet somehow also confusing (e.g., the absence of any warning, for example, when Pacino would suddenly be reviewing tape or showing up somewhere - and you are trying hard to understand how this fits into the Wigand story - and it doesn't - it's another story Pacino's working on altogether!).One of the primary problems with the movie is that it is the gospel according to one tendentious self-righteous character - one who cares nothing at all for confidentiality provisions. I suppose this is a journalistic flaw generaly - to feel that some agreements are critical (e.g., an agreement with a source) and others are entirely worthles (e.g., a confidentiality provision in an agreement with a government or in this case, corporate employee). Why this should be so is unexplained.Thus we hear Pacino's character rant about sources distrusting him in the future because the source's story was excised from a broadcast - we don't hear a word from Crowe's character about whether any employer will ever again trust him after he's agreed to take unearned compensation and free health insurance in a severance agreement in exchange for his confidentiality - and proceeds to betray the corporation's trust.So, for what critical news does the movie see the confidentiality provision as valueless? That cigarettes are referred to at one of the tobacco companies as a ""nicotine delivery system"" and that the company continued to use an ammonia-based additive that more quickly delivers the rush to the nervous system and bloodstream (for which people buy cigarettes) even while Crowe's character was working on a replacement. That's it! From this, Crowe's character grandly gives HIS view of Brown & Williamson's CEO's mental state as deceitful when that man testified that cigarettes were not addictive because nicotine was not a drug. Wow! This is news? YOu mean, they WEREN'T telling the truth? You mean cigarettes AREN'T EASY to stop smoking? I clearly recall the day after the CEOs gave that testimony before Congress that it produced nationwide ridicule - editorials in all the major newspapers, sarcastic commentary by magazines. The nation freely mocked the obvious lies.And for THIS, CBS must induce Crowe's character to violate his freely-agreed upon confidentiality provision - a provision for which he was handsomely paid (he says) and that took care of all the health needs of his children? I truly don't get it!Moreover, the movie is confusing in failing to properly emphasize the plot points. They only glancingly mention that the original broadcast is aired AFTER Wigand's testimony before a Mississippi trial is spread in newspapers around the country. The movie had already told us that his deposition testimnony in that case was ""under seal"".  So what happened? This is the movie's turning point- now it is no longer confidential - so CBS is free to broadcast Wigand's story - there is no danger any more of a judgment (properly) entered against CBS. How was the order committing the testimony under seal changed? Did the judge reverse himself? Did an appellate court overturn it? We never know.Instead, the movie emphasizes the telling of the inside story of the excision of Wigand's testimony to the NY Times - why would that change any of the minds of the CBS corporate heads or counsel? They didnt' seem to care that Wallace led off the original broadcast with his disagreement with CBS' decision - so why would they care now? The movie doesn't make it clear.What HAS changed is the viability of a suit against CBS - originally it was likely - now the information is no longer confidential so CBS is free to run Wigand's interview. Yet the movie somehow treats this as incidental - BECAUSE the movie doesn't take seriously the threat of suit, the likelihood of judgment and dismisses the entire notion of confidentiality agreements (at one point referring to suits for tortious interference with such agreements as ""something that sounds like bad radio reception"").
Ludicrously, the movie (in a very conspiratorial tone) tries to make something of the fact that CBS executives would fail to gain from a pending merger of CBS and Westinghouse due to such a lawsuit - AHA! That's why they're squelching the story. The move fails to follow through on its reasoning. Why would they fail to gain? Becuase of the perception that such a suit would be successful - as successful as the Mississippi lawyers' suits against tobacco! And both for good reason - because contracts are respected by law - not only in the U.S. but in every country on earth. The movie doesn't care.The worst scene is during the deposition of Crowe in the Mississippi case - when a tobacco lawyer properly objects to testimony that appears to invade the confidentiality of his client's commercial information - and in fact to induce breach of a specific agreement by the witness (Crowe) - against whom a court in Kentucky has already weighed the likelihood of success in a suit and issued a restraining order against Crowe's testimony. In response, the anti-tobacco lawyer hysterically screams at the anti-tobacco lawyer that they are in Mississippi rather than Kentucky - and then absurdly yells he should ""take that smirk off his face"". The movie then shows the little villain cowed - the smirk disappears. Snidely Whiplash is defeated.
This is a truly poor movie. It's a movie that fails to have a single person defend such agreements in general or in this particular - instead it creates strawmen who give personal reasons for not running the story (""I'm too old to buck the system"" or ""I unhesitatingly obey authority and this is what they say"" or ""I am nothing without CBS""). How about ""this is not very newsworthy and we may be doing something very wrong, because I respect such freely negotiated agreements?"" NOpe.The movie is agit-prop - often illogical. I was truly disappointed - I expected a LOT better.",The Insider
114,Rockwell_Cronenberg,An important film.,10,23 March 2012,"In telling the story of Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman's struggle to get the truth out, director Michael Mann was presented with two distinct goals. For one, he took on the duty of telling this important, human story to the audience. Also though, he had the difficult task of taking this story and turning it into an engaging, thrilling piece of film. There's a scene where a character discusses with Bergman how this story is something that matters, something has a national impact. For 60 Minutes, it could just be a piece of ""Sunday night entertainment...something to put on between commercials"", a story to grip the audience while they're eating their dinner. In creating The Insider it could have been the exact same thing, and part of it has to be that. Mann is given the difficult task of not only creating a piece of entertainment, a film to bring in audiences and keep them engaged for the 157 minute running time, but in taking on this particular story he also has to keep the integrity of it in tact, to make the audience aware and educated on the importance of Wigand's journey. In creating the film Mann found himself in a similar position to Bergman himself, and he pulled it off magnificently.Here Mann tells a story that really matters, something that resonates within the foundation of the American public, pulling apart a lie told against the foundation of our legal structure and shaking up the tobacco industry which had been man-handling people like Wigand and the American public for decades. This is a story that has to make a difference in the world, beyond just being a piece of entertainment. Michael Mann was the perfect director to take the wheel here because he, working from a script co-written by Eric Roth, knows just how to create a distinctively cinematic thriller but also has the intelligence to do justice to the real life people involved. Mann pieces together a precise, incredibly exciting thriller that's never dull for a moment but he also doesn't overly exaggerate events to the point where he betrays the people he is capturing on screen. He creates a film that is very cinematic, with his excellent staging and use of hand-held cameras, but is also very true. This truth then adds an even higher sense of tension to standard thriller scenes like the moment with Wigand at the driving range or searching for someone in his backyard.There is a scene where a lawyer, played by Colm Feore, that Wigand is working with talks to him about what Wigand is going through. He compares it to his experience in combat, noting the difference in the fact that combat lasts only a few seconds whereas Wigand's struggle lasts day after day, month after month and sinks into his entire life, leaving an impact on his family and his financial future. Watching Crowe's face in this moment, you can truly see the level of that impact on him. He is a good man in an unjust system, and Crowe takes us thoroughly into his anguished mind here. The extensive running time of the film gives ample opportunity for the audience to feel those walls slowly closing in on him. Nothing feels rushed or too undeveloped, but instead Mann and Crowe bring us on a slow descent with this character and watching him finally explode is a shattering moment.It's no secret to say that Al Pacino's work has taken quite the decline since his tremendous emergence in the '70s. Still, despite disappointing on most occasions he manages to every so often give a performance that is worthy of his legacy and remind the world what a powerful talent he truly is. His work as Lowell Bergman is one of the best examples of just that, portraying the former radical journalist who know works for the giant corporate network of CBS. Bergman is a man who constantly fights for what he believes in, fighting to tell the important stories and using the broader audience that CBS allows without giving in to the restrictions that come with working in such a large corporation. Taking on Wigand's testimony, Bergman is told for the first time that he's going to have to betray his word to a source and this doesn't sit well with him. There's an interesting parallel here again between what Bergman goes through and what Mann must face as well, working in the film industry. He is told to put his beliefs on hold, to sacrifice his word because CBS is too afraid of the consequences and in his riotous, dismayed reaction you have to wonder if Mann himself has ever given similar speeches when being told that he can't do something.Ultimately, Bergman and Wigand share a lot of things in common as human beings. They come from incredibly different worlds, Bergman being groomed on the streets and knowing the ins and outs of the industry, whereas Wigand is just a doctor from Louisville, Kentucky who is thrown in over his head with all of these large men with larger wallets. Despite their backgrounds though, they are both men who have their pride and their integrity and they are fighting for what they believe is right. They see these men of Big Tobacco lying on national television, lying in a court of law, and they know that it isn't right. They fight to get their story out, to expose the truth and force these men to face the consequences and it's a story that Michael Mann knows was important to get out to the film-viewing public. He does it with great stride, creating a film that is not only human and important, but also a fully engaging and tense thriller. I'm a large fan of Mann's work as a director throughout his career, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is his true masterpiece.",The Insider

This movie is well-written and well-acted.There are a couple of things that detracted from the overall quality of the movie.  First, I thought the direction was annoying in a few scenes.  There were some handheld shots that were course and jittery.  This did not convey any emotional element of the movie to me, but was a mere distraction.  I also read in Brill's Content magazine about the factual errors in the movie.

117,Silverzero,Mesmerising adaptation of a true story with outstanding performances.,10,6 June 2003,"`The Insider' has been compared in many ways to `All The President's men', released in 1976. While I found both movies to be brilliant, I don't find them to be similar in any way. While `All the President's Men' was a factual, claustrophobic look at the uncovering of the Watergate scandal, `The Insider' is much more subjective and at times, a bit more compelling. Anyway, `The Insider' is an outstanding and continually fascinating look at this story that occurred not so many years ago. It's not very often that I can say this and mean it, but this is one of the few movies that is engaging for it's entirety, and at 158 minutes, that's quite an achievement. It's just a shame that the movie didn't receive international success it deserved. I wasn't very impressed with `Heat' (Michael Mann's last outing) so wasn't sure if this would be any good. Where I found `Heat' to be boring, `The Insider' was simply mesmerising. The flashy, shady directory techniques are magnificent and though this is a lot less murky and subtle than `All the President's Men' was, it still creates the desired effect. Backing up the excellent direction is outstanding acting from the lead actors.
The best performance comes from Russell Crowe in the first of his three nominations (Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind soon followed). His portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand is first rate and he proves he can lose the machismo for these quieter but very powerful roles. He definitely should have won the Oscar that year. Al Pacino does his familiar `grumpy determined' part but he's never done it with as much substance and pure gusto as he does it here. `Mr. Von Trapp'- Christopher Plummer, does his part quite well as the head of the network. Diane Venora plays her `good wife' part adequately but there isn't much material she has to work with. There's a big (if not un-necessary) supporting cast with average performances from the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Lindsay Crouse, Michael Gambon and Debi Mazar. What most surprises me is the fact that the movie was nominated for 8 Oscars and didn't win a single one. It definitely deserved to win Best Picture ahead of the pretentious, contrived and manipulative `American Beauty', let alone Best Actor and Best Director. `The Insider' is a brilliant and muchly under-rated account of the uncovering of the truth about the addictions of nicotine. It's just a shame that it didn't receive the huge audience it deserved. Definitely a film that deserves a reserved spot in the IMDb Top 100. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10.",The Insider
118,Greatornot,Whistleblowers Paradise,9,28 February 2010,"I guess the truth shall prevail... eventually. This was an excellent movie . Russel Crowe and Al Pacino were excellent together , especially the scenes where they were interacting. The dialogue was on target and the scenes prolific. You can tell the actors did not miss a beat and were comfortable with each other. Probably, Pacinos last exemplary performance. Wigand was a disgruntled former ex employee of a tobacco giant persuaded by Pacino to tell his story of the industry and its methods of getting people hooked on cigarettes. The details boring and irrelevant for the purpose of this review. Involved were the cigarette companies threats of litigation,violence and blackmail. CBS backed down and than we had a surprise whistleblower in Lowell Bergman- Al Pacino. Christopher Plummer was excellent as well playing '60 Minutes' anchor Mike Wallace. This screenplay hit the mark and highlighted the world of the investigative reporter as well as the News industry in general and the power the large corps have , as far as manipulating the newsworthy issues. Unfortunately, fascism is alive and well in America. Based on a true story, thankfully we still have a couple of men of integrity like Wigand and Bergman. Not exactly Woodward and Bernstein , but this film did have the feel of watergates scandal- 'All The Presidents Men', concocted a couple decades earlier.",The Insider
119,macpherr,The movie is excellent.,7,3 January 2001,"Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer, Suspect) has written great scripts. The Insider kept me watching, and grabbed my attention. Very well written and with a great cast ""Lowell Bergman"" Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays  ""Jeffrey Wigand "" is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that.  The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money!  Why they decide to destroy the life of  Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an  impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: ""You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious."" Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: ""I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials."" Lowell Bergman: ""To a network, probably, we're all  commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are  is important."" I recommend this movie. It is excellent.",The Insider

They feel that airing this story will cause a major lawsuit on CBS, and destroy the business deal of Westinghouse's purchase of the network.  And if Westinghouse doesn't buy CBS, the executives will lose a lot of money. The other Goliath is the big tobacco company.  If Jeffrey testify against his former employer's his health benefits will be taken away, and Jeffrey needs it since one of his daughters suffers from asthma. This is quite a story, and Michael Mann does a brilliant job of bringing it to the screen.  Mann has done a excellent job in the past of showing true to life crime stories: THIEF& MANHUNTER.  A violent, yet historical adaptation of THE LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  And his biggest and best work yet about a Los Angeles epic crime story, HEAT.  THE INSIDER isn't as good as HEAT, but it does come pretty darn close.  It's the kind of film that goes by quicker and it's more enjoyable every time you watch it.     The acting is top notch as well.  There's a strong supporting cast including: Christopher Plummer, Phillip Baker Hall, Michael Gambon, Diane Verona, Lindsay Crouse, Debbi Mazar, and Bruce McGill.  But the two leads, Pacino and Crowe, definitly stand out for their acting.  Pacino does a excellent job as the network producer who is suffering from trying to get the truth exposed, but is being pushed back from doing that. And Crowe is also excellent as the informer who is looking over his shoulder as he's fearing for his life. What's also great about this film is the excellent cinematography by Dante Spinotti.  Spinotti has done a great job in the past with HEAT and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, but in THE INSIDER, he displays his best work yet!  Some of the scenes just need to be seen to see how great of a job Spinotti does. And the music score is also wonderful.  It really adds to the suspense and tension that this story brings. That is why I LOVED, THE INSIDER so much.  There is so much to love about it.  Like many other films that try to make a point with it's story, THE INSIDER does it so well.  And Michael Mann not only does it well, but with style.  I will be very disappointed if this film, the actors, and cinematographer don't get recognized in Febuary for the Oscars.  This film well deserves it!  A outstanding, not to be missed classic! ***** (out of five)",The Insider
124,heisenberg12,Good Acting. Solid Film,8,18 June 2015,"This is just a well acted film that has a solid, no bull-s--- way of storytelling to it.The only thing lacking in it is any explosive scenes. The most explosive scene to me was when Crowe is called into the office and they threaten and blackmail him, but besides that there are not many memorable, strong scenes.However, that's okay if that's the kind of story it is. Instead, it is driven more by dialogue, acting, and ""based on true events"" story, that had major ramifications.Crowe was outstanding, and really pulls off some incredibly good subtle acting- it's a quietly brilliant performance. Pacino was very good, as usual.There needs to be more movies made like this. It's just solid and ""GOOD"". From Michael Mann, what do you expect?",The Insider
125,son_of_cheese_messiah,Drawn-out and unsatisfying like a bad cigarette,4,7 February 2012,"Considering the huge dramatic potential of this story, one wonders how the director could have made it any more boring. Instead of plot or character development we are subjected to endless meandering sequences, often accompanied by soporific 'wailing woman' music. Much of it looks like a pop video and not a very good one. Then blam, a sudden melodramatic scene with Pacino and Crowe shouting at each other. The film is about 3 hours but seems MUCH longer. Anyone making such a film about a similar subject in 1950 would have made it in 90 minutes tops and the film would have been tighter and better for it.As it is, the film vacillates between this ambling (and very undramatic) style with scenes of manufactured conflict. There is nothing in between. Clearly the director was keen to make a 'great' and 'important' film, but Michael Mann is no Kubrik and cannot sustain his rambling camera-work. The final scene with Pacino walking out the door of CBS, summed up the pretentious ambitions of the film. Pointlessly subjected to slowing down and speeding up it was the final piece of self indulgence in a highly indulgent film.The inherently interesting subject matter attracted a large cast of fine actors. Pacino is always watchable and Plummer puts in a good turn. Crowe is competent if uninspiring in his role. The script, like everything could have done with a good deal of editing. There is also a lazy reference to @all the presidents' men' near the end, a much tauter and better film.",The Insider

127,GirishGowda,Two of the biggest stars come together to do a true story,8,2 May 2010,"I saw this movie today and this was the first movie I watched which starred either Al Pacino or Russell Crowe after I knew about them. I may have seen either of them before in other movies, but I don't recall watching either one of them previously on screen. It was coming on TV today and I knew that they starred in it and I watched it.Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a TV producer of '60 minutes' on CBS which is an explosive show revealing the darker side of society. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is a corporate Vice-President and Head of research & development in Brown & Williams Tobacco Company (or something). He is fired from his job as he was having a moral conflict with himself over the substances put into the tobaccos and the company felt threatened by him. They made him sign a legal confidentiality report and threatened his family. But, he wanted the truth to be told, that their tobacco was basically a drug. Thousands of lawsuits were brushed off every year by the company and he wanted the company to pay for their sins. Lowell Bergman contacts Jeffrey and they, with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) as the interviewer, record Jeffrey's allegations on tape. But, due to the fact that the tobacco company could file a defamation lawsuit worth billions of dollars, CBS decides to cut out Jeffrey's interviews. In the end, Lowell gets his way and the company ends up owing $250 billion to America.The opening scene with Lowell and Mike Wallace in Iraq establishes them as true news presenters who fight for the truth and justice. They do their work with passion and are very good at what they do. The film also gives a lot of screen time on Jeffrey's family and his wife's inner turmoil on whether she could support her husband or not, in those dangerous times. Jeffrey is 'The Insider' who has lots of information about the company's illegal ways. Though the edge of the sword was always dangling above Jeffrey's neck, the villains were never shown, except in a couple of scenes and they weren't the routine big goons, as basically the tobacco company itself was the villain. Russell Crowe impressed me a lot and all of the actors did a wonderful job in portraying this real life story. But, I don't think I become a Al Pacino or Russell Crowe fan by watching this. This isn't completely a thriller, but also drama. It was perfectly directed by Michael Mann and as I didn't know how the ending went, I enjoyed it very much.8/10",The Insider

129,ryangilmer007,The Film that only Oscar forgot,10,28 June 2000,"How this movie, the best film of 1999, got a grand total of 0 oscars will remain a mystery for a long time.First, the movie takes a story about an overweight whistle blower with family issues and melds it with tobacco & the world of deception, cancer, medical hu-do, and lawyers.  It does this and is watchable and interesting.Second, the acting is superb.  Crowe went all out preparing and doing the role and Pacino portrays his aspect very well.Three, Mann is the Jack of all trades.  He makes a short story/article into a nicely flowing and very long movie.  The tough subject matter (above) is intriging full of suspense (despite the fact that we know the general ending from the true history).  He then produces a good ad campaign (the poster is a classic pun of a cigarrete package. Finally, as director the entire package comes together.Despite the nominations and despite the performances, the film did not find a huge audience and it was the only one of the 1999 best-picture nominees not to gain massive revenue from its nomination.Possible reasons for this are that the film is really long (155 minutes) and the subject matter is complex.  Given this, long attention spans and an interested audience are needed.  Also, Mann may still have the TV type stigma from his Miami Vice Days (although he has since been connected to many other quality movies).  Maybe it was the writing, as it  was on a true event stigma (and therefore less work because an outline is theoretically established).  Perhaps, Crowe (being a relatively unknown) hurt awards. Another possibility is maybe people thought Mann hollywoodized history (like Hurricane and U-571); although I cannot see it.In the end, it did not separate itself from American Beauty as Best picture. While the two had differing audiences and vastly different material, both films were great stories with nice writing and good acting.Either way, The Insider is a great movie that should not be missed.  It is long, but every minute is important to the story.  It did not win a single oscar, but it was good enough to win all that it was nominated for.",The Insider
130,danielll_rs,A high level drama,8,27 February 2000,"I didn't know what to expect of ""The Insider"". The first time I heard about it I didn't care much. Then, I saw one scene at a TV programme and I thought it was a conventional film as ""A Civil Action"". But, in December, it received some nominations to the Golden Globe, including best picture and, even not winning anyone, I started to show some interest about it. About fifteen days ago, the nominees for the Oscar were announced and I knew that ""The Insider"" could be a strong rival for ""American Beauty"" -my new favorite film-, so it had to be almost as good as the other one. Well... I watched it this afternoon, and... if it's not better than ""American Beauty"", or as good as that, it is a high level film which has its importance.Everything in ""The Insider"" has a high level, from the acting to the screenplay. Director Michael Mann, whose previous works were ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Heat"", does a wonderful job with the camera and is helped by a very well written screenplay, based on a true story, which makes suspense about ordinary things and keeps the attention of the audience. If Kevin Spacey weren't on the list for best actor nominees, my favorite one would be Russell Crowe. He was great in ""LA Confidential"" and here he perfectly plays a man in contradiction, who has to make an important decision and has to deal with the consequences. Al Pacino delivers a stellar performance once more, and Christopher Plummer should have been remembered by the Academy. The film has its flaws (the fact that it is slow, for instance), but this defects are covered by its great qualities.""The Insider"" is a very important movie for some reasons. It is about the power of the media in the '90s and how it can manipulate people. But, more than anything, it is a film about ethics, and how ordinary people deal with it. Russell Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand, is on a very difficult situation, and the film shows very well how he faces it. That's one of the greatest points of this picture.I gave ""The Insider"" a 9 out of 10 for all its qualities and great points, showing a sad true story very, very well. But if you want PERFECTION, pure perfection, go watch ""American Beauty"", which is for sure my favorite for best picture.",The Insider
131,oshram-3,Strong performances overcome uneven direction.,7,16 April 2000,"Michael Mann's unfocused and tepid direction is not enough to kill this film, gladly, because Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and Pacino is at the very top of his game here. It's hard to single out any Pacino performance as being one of his best -- he's had so many -- but this one is certainly up there. Chris Plummer is also very good as Mike Wallace.

133,senortuffy,Excellent suspense drama.,9,3 December 2003,"You wouldn't think a film about a corporate whistleblower could be as exciting as this one, but Michael Mann did a superb job of keeping this viewer on the edge of his seat for two and a half hours.  He doesn't make many films - this one came out four years after his previous one, ""Heat"" (also excellent) - but the director makes the most of his shots.First of all, the acting is superb.  Russell Crowe is as good in his portrayal of the scientist who blows the tobacco industry's dirty little secret as he was playing Maximus in ""Gladiator"" - he was nominated for an Oscar as best leading actor (Mann was nominated for director also).  Neither of them won, nor did anyone else associated with this film, so maybe the tobacco thugs were getting the final word after all.Crowe handles this difficult part extremely well.  Dr. Wigand is a man tortured with inner doubts.  Does he do what he knows is right, expose the tobacco industry for peddling an addictive drug under the guise of an innocent agricultural product, or does he knuckle under to corporate pressure to keep quiet?  Complicating his life is a wife who doesn't want to take risks, who resents their lowered economic status, and who eventually deserts him when he needs all the moral support he can get.  Cameron Crowe reveals all these inner conflicts in a most believable way and makes his character a hero without the usual props.Al Pacino plays the ""60 Minutes"" producer, Lowell Bergman, in his usual fine manner.  He's a bit of a crusader, and the film takes some liberties in the truth to build up his character, but he comes off well without being too overbearing.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent as Mike Wallace.  And the rest of the cast is very good too.  But it's a tribute to Crowe's acting skills that he was able to outshine Pacino in a movie that was made for him.And the best part of this film is that it is, except for some dramatic enhancements, true.  Dr. Wigand's testimony was the start of tearing apart the veneer of invulnerability the tobacco industry had managed to create for itself.  Since that ""60 Minutes"" piece, these huge corporations have been forced to pay out enormous sums to litigants harmed by their products, and that is really a sweet thing.",The Insider

The characters in this movie are incredibly investing because Mann doesn't paint them as perfect they're all making mistakes and screwing up which makes them seem more human. Russell Crowe is absolutely amazing in this movie with Gladiator also being one of my favourite movies I wasn't sure if I'd ever see a better performance from him but here he is just as good not only is his accent convincing but the toll taken on him is perfectly conveyed through his masterful performance. Al Pacino is every bit his equal he perfectly conveys his no nonsense, experienced character making you believe that no one else could have played this part. The tension in this movie is done just right every time Crowe puts his (or his families) safety on the line you feel it you are worried as to what the company is going to do to him next. Is also a very interesting film, to see all the ways in which Crowe and Pacino are trying to combat Big Tobacco using the law in very specific way and it further enthuses Pacino's experience and Crowes vulnerability. When things do go Crowes way you feel it the writing in this movie is so good that you are desperate for Crowe to succeed because overall you see that he just wants to do the right thing. I absolutely adore The Insider it's suspenseful and heartbreaking and in many ways also uplifting it's got some Career best performances and makes me desperate to see more films from Michael Mann.100%-A+",The Insider

No trademark Michael Mann shootings or chase-scenes but great acting, great dialog, a great script and great music. Based on true events but slightly altered for dramatic reasons, The Insider is a top notch thinking man's thriller. Pacino in one of his best roles of the '90s, Russell Crowe in his best role ever and a supporting cast to match.

It took Hollywood to spice it up a bit, and making it interesting. Great job by Michael Mann. Pacino and Crowe terrific as martyrs trying to expose a truth so obvious to us.

Their crusade is fascinating to watch, and you'll find yourself totally engaged in the story.

While his performance was subtle and convincing and definitely worthy of a nomination, I was more taken aback by Mann's directorial style and his fine attention to characters.""The Insider"" is definitely not your standard thriller.  Events do not move the story along here as much as characters do.  Characters'internal conflicts, doubts, fears, and uncertainties are what drives and raises this film above the usual fare.It's Mann's novelisitc approach to the story that makes it such a refreshing change of pace.  He avoids almost all thriller cliches: there is no excessive profanity, no shootouts, no fistfights, no murders.  The result is a mesmerizing, totally involving, refreshing, and frighteningly realistic film.Russel Crowe's subtle, brooding, and humanistic portrayal of Dr. Wigand and the loss and forced change of his life and family bring a deep emotion to the film.  Wigand falling down a hill in his yard is one of the film's most unsettling scenes.  The rest of the ensemble cast also does well, but Crowe's haunting performance overshadows even veteran Al Pacino.Definitely not a conventional, over-the-top thriller, Mann's character tour-de-force is a welcome change to a genre that usually makes the viewer suspend belief.

146,Deckard-16,"What ""All The President's Men"" was to newspaper journalism, this movie is to TV journalism.",10,7 November 1999,"This film is unavoidably being compared to director Alan J. Pakula's ""All The President's Men"" and for good reason, because Michael Mann's new film is every bit as good. (Anybody is the TV news biz -like me- knows that newspaper and TV news are very different animals.) ""The Insider"" is a very mature film. It takes its sweet time letting the events unfold. However Mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable. But first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances: one by a master we've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league. Of course I'm talking about Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino adds another mammoth blast in his Hall of Fame collection of home run performances. His portrayal of 60 Minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting. He vents anger and frustration better than any actor I've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here. Now on to the ""new"" guy. Anybody who has seen Russell Crowe before (especially in his Oscar-worthy effort in ""L.A. Confidential"") is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against Pacino, but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this. Crowe's role as ""the guy"" who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding. Not since Pacino's work in ""The Godfather II"" have I've seen it done so well. Like every other thing Mann has done the supporting actors are great too, but the standout here is Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line. The story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff, but Mann and co-scripter Eric Roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting. It is riveting and important entertainment. Like the phrase ""TV journalism"", ""important entertainment"" may seem like a contradiction of terms, but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year.",The Insider
147,fleagles,An exciting look at a disturbing story,9,23 December 1999,"The Insider succeeds as a thriller while tackling the difficult job of a controversial news story.  It is about Jeffrey Wigand, the Brown & Williamson executive who wanted to tell of Big Tobacco's lies to CBS' 60 Minutes, and that network's refusal to air the story.  Russell Crowe gives a fantastic performance that not only should be remembered at Oscar time, but should guarantee that he will become one of the top actors in the future. Al Pacino is very good (as usual) as Lowell Bergman, the renegade producer who fights with CBS and Wigand in order to save Wigand's story.  Christopher Plummer mimics Mike Wallace perfectly, and the rest of the cast are all good.  But most of all, it is Michael Mann's direction that makes this film work.  It moves at a frenetic pace, and pushes the audience to feel the tension and frustration of the story.  This film has not performed well financially, and that's sad; audiences may feel that they already know this story.

A row of cars drive almost solemnly as in a cortege toward a courthouse where a deposition will be given. Another vehicle twists through the streets of a Middle Eastern city with a destination rife with danger. These are just three of the images Michael Mann presents us with in his latest film, `The Insiders'. It's this constant parade of resonant scenes  that transform what could have been a run-of-the-mill TV movie of the week into one of most incisive and burning dramas to come from a major studio since `All the President's Men'.The actors portray a cast of real-life  people, never imitating, but subtly communicating their innermost feelings and conflicts. Al Pacino is Lowell Berman, segment producer of 60 Minutes, preparing an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, recently fired executive of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. Pacino has his best role in years. Here there is none of the scenery chewing he has been somewhat guilty of in `Devil's Advocate' and `Scarface'. This stunning expose of the tobacco industry will rock the lives of Wigand and his family, and change the public's view of Big Tobacco forever. Russell Crowe (as Wigand) delivers another award worthy performance as he tortures himself as to whether or not he should reveal the stunning facts he has been privy to as part of his job. Crowe actually gained weight to realistically resemble Wigand.  Christopher Plummer is perfect as Mike Wallace in a not altogether pleasant portrayal of this TV icon. Plummer is sure to garner  supporting actor nominations for this role. Description of the plot cannot do justice to Mann's passionate rendering of this story. He has delivered a motion picture for adults without the violence, car chases and explosions we are used to. And yet, the undercurrent of danger remains lurking around every corner threatening the lives of the people who just want to do what is right.",The Insider

The movie was neither too long nor too short. I never felt something like ""We get it, now another scene please!"".

150,Geff,The Insider and a great performance by Bruce McGill,10,1 April 2015,"The Insider is one of the best films of all time. Great performances by all, including a gripping performance in a courtroom scene by Bruce McGill. When I think of The Insider, and Al Pacino and Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer and all the other great performances, I think of that courtroom scene and McGill (D-Day). He should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor award for that one scene. Check it out. The Insider is definitely one of the best thrillers of all time, and based on the true story of the legal case against the tobacco companies. After seeing this film, you'll know why you could never quit smoking. Only Russell Crowe, the insider, knows why.",The Insider
151,Tetsel,"Solid, Impressive Film",8,5 November 1999,"This film is powerful and high-charged with tension. Despite a storyline that would appear dull on paper, Mann's direction and the fantastic acting of Crowe and Pacino keep it moving with the dynamics of a 90 minute thriller. Mann has a knack for pulling the human side out of even the most horrible of situations, and here again he shows us high drama and still makes it a character piece. The film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, directing ,cinematography and editing.",The Insider
152,antonjsw1,"Truly superb drama with excellent performances by Pacino, Crowe and Plummer",10,10 July 2012,"Michael Mann follows his superb Heat with an excellent if more cerebral drama. Firstly, the script by Eric Roth and Mann brilliantly distills a complex story into narrative that is suspenseful, emotionally effective yet highly thoughtful and sophisticated. It certainly has a lot to say about the shady worlds of US corporate, legal and media culture. Despite this complexity the film zips along at a terrific pace, mainly due to the excellent script being supported by great direction and first rate acting by the whole cast, albeit special mention has to go to Pacino, Crowe and Plummer for truly outstanding performances. Certainly that fearsome intangible of powerful corporate forces working to destroy an individual's reputation comes across very strongly, and Russell Crowe's intense performance is key in selling this to the audience. It is also fascinating to see the situation that Pacino's Lowell Bergmann's character is put into by these corporate forces, and these two character's willingness to hold onto their integrity and beliefs is genuinely affecting despite the great personal cost it has on their characters, particularly Crowe's. Crowe's and Pacino's excellent portrayals are well complimented by Plummer veteran reporter/correspondent character, and the journey this character goes through while different, is nevertheless fascinating even if his character doesn't generate the same levels of sympathy for his plight – in fact it is his initial actions at a key point in the story that generate a great sense of disappointment in his character Mann orchestrates proceeding with bravado and panache, though not forgetting that this is a cerebral drama where ultimately it is the actors' performances that will lead to the success of the movie. However, Mann is a master of embedding slick film-making around excellent dramatic performances. Not only does he get the actors to shine, but he yet again draws excellent work from both the photography and editing teams, and huge credit has to go to editors William Goldenberg, David Rosenbloom and Paul Rubell, musicians Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard and Graeme Revell, production designer Brian Morris and particularly Mann regular director of photography Dante Spinotti. It certainly deserved its 7 Academy Award nominations and in my view should have won several.Despite its lack of commercial success, this is a fantastic film, which tells of terrific story through excellent performances from its lead actors, who work in a visual environment that beautifully complements their performances, for which Michael Mann deserves huge credit.",The Insider

154,rcraig62,Role reversal,6,16 June 2004,"Many great actors fall into self-parody atone time or another. Brando did, Orson Welles did, and so has Al Pacino.  A frequent criticism I've heard of Pacino over the last ten years or so is ""now he yells all his dialogue"", which is the layman's way or saying just that- that Pacino is playing some facsimile of himself, leaning on some remnant of past glories. Yet when we see Pacino in a different role, somethng unexpected of him, as the PC mayor in City Hall or the sleazy near-Satanic attorney of Devil's Advocate, the audience doesn't quite accept him.  Of all the big actors, Pacino is the one most identified with a particular character, the crusader who fights the corrupt system- even if he's corrupt as well, as he was in the Godfather movies or Dog Day Afternoon.  He now plays nearly everything over-the-top, like a Frank Gorshin doing an Al Pacino imitation (Glengarry Glen Ross was the last hint of subtlety or pinpoint anger), which is why his performance in ""The Insider"" comes as a pleasant surprise, even if the face is tired and the features slung low, he gives enough combative vitality to hearken back to the old days.
       The thing I found interesting here is the casting:  Russell Crowe, a man in his 30's playing a 50ish scientist and Pacino, a man of about 60 playing a 40 or so TV producer (even if he does look like he ought to be wearing glasses-on-a-chain).  This time the ""system"" is 60 Minutes, who has Pacino working on an expose of the tobacco industry, then after Pacino gets a top scientist (Crowe) to go on camera with damaging information that will ruin the scientist's family and work life, 60 Minutes honcho Don Hewitt, kowtowing to corporate interests, decides not to run the interview.  I'd like to think Hewitt and Mike Wallace in particular are not as bad as they come off here (Wallace is a brash egomaniac who ponders his legacy, his great gift to history and Hewitt so pragmatic and bottom-line-conscious he should be running a CPA firm).        The two lead performances are terrific: Crowe is superb as well as the true crusader that's in all of us; we want to be brave but with an eye toward the consequences.  Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace imitation is downright hysterical, although I swear to God he sounded more and more like the real Wallace by the end.  The negative to the picture is Michael Mann's direction.  His snail pacing is ponderous and he tends to present events as though they're Grand Opera.  One scene where Crowe returns home to find his wife and kids have left him is so laughingly overscored, so superfluous in its indication of a great moment that it spoils the delicacy of the simple emotion.  Mann, who also directed Pacino's cracked performance in Heat, seems to think he is creating epics, when, in fact, a movie with a theme of journalism should have been made to meet a deadline.  I thought ""Shattered Glass"", another movie about journalism, was better crafted, more taut and concise.  But see this one for two great actors in their glory, one current and one remembered.  3*** out of 4",The Insider
155,flickjunkie-3,Intriguing and Clever. Worth a Look.,8,20 December 2000,"After getting nominated for 7 Academy Awards, I was dying to see The Insider. Well, I must say, I was basically blown away by how much effort went into this film, and it is very recommendable.Based on a magazine article, The Insider follows the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), head of a tobacco company's Research And Development department, who discovers that the fag companies have for years not only known that nicotine was addictive, but worse, they've been messing around with the formula to make it even more so. After being persuaded to give a TV interview by producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino Pacino), Wigand discovers that smoking is deeply bad for your health, even if you've never lit a gasper in your life. Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.Some powerhouse performances here, Al Pacino is corker as Bergman, but New Zealander Russell Crowe pulls off the most impressive act in the film, therefore earning himself an Oscar nomination. Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever. The only faults there may be here is the fact that The Insider could be a big bore for some audiences, but for me, it was an enthralling experience.A well done film, definitely worth your time.I rate The Insider 8 out of 10.",The Insider
156,paul-nemecek,"A story worth telling, a story well told",9,8 July 2018,"It will come as no surprise to faithful readers of this column that I like good movies. I also like that even rarer event, the important movie. Rarest of all is that special movie that is both good and important. Michael Mann's The Insider is just such a film.Mann's best-known efforts to date are the films Heat and Last of the Mohicans. This film demands a more subtle and sophisticated guiding hand and Mann clearly rises to the challenge. The Insider is the somewhat fictionalized, but basically true, story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a tobacco executive turned whistle blower. It is also the story of Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a passionate producer who becomes a whistle-blowing insider in his own right.The subject matter of the film places it in the tradition of films like Silkwood, The China Syndrome, and A Civil Action. When Wigand agrees to go on the record exposing the cover-ups and perjury by tobacco industry executives he is harassed, threatened, betrayed, and abandoned. The real story here though is how CBS was bullied into softening and burying the story. Pacino's performance as the passionate producer with integrity provides the moral center of the film.It should come as no surprise that this is a good film. In addition to Mann's capable direction, there are some excellent performances by Crowe (who viewers might remember as Bud White in LA Confidential) and Pacino. Christopher Plummer also does superior work in his less than flattering portrayal of Mike Wallace. The screenplay is adapted from a short story by one of the masters of adaptation, Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer). Cinematographer Dante Spinotti uses color, light, and shadows to infuse the story with rich visual symbols. This is a good film by a team of gifted artists.But this is also an important film. It would be a mistake to see this film as simply a film about the tobacco industry or the co-optation of the news industry. Ultimately, it is about corporate power in its broadest sense. It was especially interesting watching this film on the weekend of the Microsoft monopoly ruling. The clear message of this film is that we all lose when the bottom line of corporate profits is our only moral compass. We live in a society desperately in need of prophetic critique and moral pronouncement. The Insider does not say all that needs to be said, but it provides a welcome start to a much-needed dialogue.",The Insider

158,Dark Eye,Way too overrated,4,14 September 2000,"American moviemaking is so deceptive these days.  Get A-list actors, directors, and some decent, serious plot for a film, and you'll get those academy award nominations rolling in.  But great actors don't make a great film.  Story is always, and has always been, number one.I thought this film gives us a slick pacing in its storyline, which is good. But it is emotionally flat throughout the picture.  The biggest problem is the theme itself.  I don't know about the others who thinks this film is a roller-coaster thriller, but almost everyone now knows that smoking is bad for the health.  I felt like I already knew half of the story before I actually walk in to the theatre.I am biased when I saw this movie, I admit.  My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs. Still, I was hoping that the film would provide some plot-twists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys, just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it. True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up - he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck, I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino, but for the first time I did.This movie, being a true story, showed a lot of promise, but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen (and vice versa).  I blame it on the director.  Those who thinks that Wigand is psychologically tormented obviously hasn't seen a Hitchcock film!",The Insider
159,Surecure,Intensity beyond intensity,10,29 March 2005,"The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story. Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an in-depth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject, that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.There is real skill displayed in the way in which the Insider weaves through the aspects of both Bergmann and Wigand's lives. Whereas a lesser director would have thrown the characters at each other in an artificial collision, Mann introduces each character as being average professionals each living in their own respective stable lives. It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.Bringing life to these fantastically written characters are two of the most talented 'big-name' character actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Surprisingly, it is Crowe that drives this film forward, and his portrayal of Wigand is spot-on perfect. His is an honest humanity, both a loving father and a flawed husband who never fully balances his life under the pressure of circumstance. Crowe nails the performance by not hamming-up the character, but rather by understating his personality. This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.That is not to ignore the excellent work by the remainder of the cast. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Most notably are several standout scenes mixing Pacino, Plummer, Philip Baker Hall and Stephen Tobolowsky that ground the underlying tensions of the film fantastically. And the juxtaposition between the cold, hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard non-fiction works.Easily one of the best dramas of 1999, the Insider is a standout member of that elite club of great historical dramas such as All the President's Men that are few and far between. It is for that audience that appreciates skilled performances meeting skilled direction and restrained, mature writing.",The Insider

Well he failed. The difference is that ATPM was about the Constitution and this movie is about smoking. So it was hard to get excited about it. Michael Mann tried to use some of the tricks he used in 'Heat' - but it just didn't work since the subject was a bespecaled scientist with a PHd. This is another movie (The Green Mile is another) that is *way* too long. On the positive side, the acting is good - even Al Pacino tried to constrain his over-acting tendencies. But overall - pretty boring, too long - and another reason why American Beauty should sweep the Oscars. One other comment - the film was based on a program made in 1994 yet (small) mobile phones, the Internet and e-mail were seen. Sloppy directing.",The Insider

Big Tobacco fights back by trying to dig up as much dirt as possible about Wigand and even threatening him and his family.  The movie is tense, scary, and the worst part is, it's true.

Was I afraid of a socio-screed against cigarette companies?  Al Pacino acting up several storms?My advice -- having now seen it twice -- is to view this one while it's still in the theater.  This is the sort of intelligent, gripping movie Hollywood produces when it's at its best.  Like QUIZ SHOW, DONNIE BRASCO, CITY HALL, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, THE INSIDER has a tight, tight script, moves at a great pace, offers an insightful story about humans, and has terrific performances and cinematography.  Michael Mann pushes the quasi-documentary camerawork perhaps just a bit too much for some tastes; I thought it was terrific.  A very deep nod of approval to Russell Crowe.  This is the sort of subtle acting that I don't think most folks realize is so special.  He details his performance so beautifully, even pushing up his glasses perfectly in character.  I could see both the reserved southern gent in him as well as the man who has a problem managing his anger.  The only time it doesn't completely work -- and I would suggest it was a writing and directing problem -- is in a scene in which he is badgered to get on the telephone. His sudden explosion is more a movie mannerism than a glimpse of reality; little matter, though, as he quickly makes the scene work.  A terrific performance from Christopher Plummer, too.  (And Al does fine, keeping the ham largely off the plate.)The only movie that touches this one in 1999 is THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (or, much more arguably, TOY STORY 2 and THE STRAIGHT STORY).  THE INSIDER is more than worth checking out; it's something of a treasure.",The Insider

If you liked American Beauty, come see its strongest Oscar challenger so far this year.  Personally, I find The Insider to be hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.People will say (have said, actually) that it's boring or too long.  If you see this movie, be prepared.  It is long.  But I never once looked at my watch (notwishstanding the fact that I don't have one), and I was never bored for a moment.  I was completely engrossed from start to finish.  At movie's end, I would have happily sat down again (after a brief stretch) and watched it again, despite the lateness of the hour.The performances are magical.  Pacino, Crowe, and Plummer all must be seen. Let's hope this pushes Crowe up a notch in the realm of professional respectability.But it's the direction that makes this film.  When it's praised, it's the director being praised.  The long pauses, which irritate some (when it's criticizes, it's the director being criticized), provide the viewer with a peaceful moment which is needed to process and come to terms with the material.  The story is not thriller material, but the direction provides all the tension and excitement of a thriller.  But most thrillers are mindless, and a savage, relentless pace doesn't hurt the narrative.  In this film, however, the tension and excitement must never be allowed to obscure the story.  The pauses allow for the audience to stay with the story.  They are gently pulled along with the events, rather than having images and ideas simply thrown up at them.Lastly, I would just like to point out that Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand, as they are portrayed in this film, are probably the two most heroic, admirable characters I've ever seen on film.",The Insider

The man is great in absolutely anything he does; I don't give a rotten rat's butt what anyone says about him being tired or frequently overacting, that's all a load of hooey. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see Crowe take the brunt of the acting and really run with it. He was superb in this film and deserved the ocsar for best actor this year (sorry Spacey...you were good, but not that good). Pacino and Christopher Plummer both added to the mix as volatile elements in a taut and well-directed film by a truly great filmmaker who has lots more chances to shine - Michael Mann (Heat and Last Of The Mohicans are two of the best films of the decade). Hell, even Wings Hauser and Phillip Baker Hall get in on the act and deliver great performances as well. Amazing. If you haven't seen this movie yet...what in the name of Scorsese are you waiting for? Brilliant acting, brilliant cinematography, and an astonishing cast and script add up to without a doubt, the best film of the year - American Beauty, for all it's merits, was way overrated in my opinion.

The story itself is not done as much justice as Bergman's Frontline piece gave it, but a lot of the important info is there. Wigand did a brave thing and the drama of the movie comes from his agonizing over why he did it, if it was worth it and how did he find the will to go through with it.

Most people that I know have been aware of the dangers of smoking for a very long time and so it's really no surprise to learn that major tobacco companies make it so that cigarettes are highly addictive. Apparently this isn't supposed to be fair, especially since the CEOs of the 7 major companies all swore under oath that they didn't believe nicotine was addictive. This movie is about a scientist who worked for Brown and Williamson, the #3 tobacco company, who had knowledge that his CEO lied and therefore cast doubt on the veracity of the other 6 CEOs. So, in a nutshell, if they lied and knew their product was causing cancer deaths worldwide, they would therefore be liable and could be sued for billions of dollars. The movie centers on Al Pacino as ""60 Minutes"" segment producer Lowell Bergman, and glowering Russell Crowe as Jeffery Wigand, the scientist with a conscience, as they struggle to come to grips with the truth as it relates to the law and their ethics.

A young Russell Crowe beefs up and grays down to play Jeffrey Wigand, and ex-Big Tobacco exec who wants to go on national TV and blow the whistle on some of his company's darker practices. 60 Minutes supervisor Lowell Bergman (a fiery Pacino, who gives an excellent performance, although bearing no resemblance to the real Bergman)fights to get Wigand on the air, while the CBS Brass, along with veteran reporter Mike Wallace (Chritopher Plummer)do their best to kill the story, fearing a lawsuit. Mann turns a real-life newsroom battle into a pulse-pounding thriller, complete with a tense score by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke, and superb cimenatography by the great Dante Spinotti. If you want a single scene that showcases all of this, I'll give you one; Wigand golfs at night, and is threatened by a Big Tobacco worker.

Also, as a person living in the South, I admire the film for not portraying Southerners as idiots, as many Hollywood films do. And I loved the unconventional soundtrack.If I had to find something to complain about in this film, it would be that I think Jeffrey Wigand fades a little too much into the background towards the end of the film; his reactions to events could have been detailed a little further.  And I don't think Mike Wallace would realistically be dumb enough to yell at one of Shiekh Fadlallah's bodyguards.  Still, The Insider is quality entertainment and worthy of its Academy Award nominations. 9/10",The Insider
178,dreamingescapist,"I'm running out of heroes, guys like you are in short supply.",9,30 August 2019,"'The Insider' is as stylish as it is thought-provoking. Based on real-life events makes the film timeless, but more, the overall message the movie carries beneath its devastating true story makes the film even more poignant today - the era where corporate greed has grown, and manipulation with media is so out of hands that they barely try to hide it anymore. Michael Mann uses magnificently his trademark action film aesthetics to bring this deep humane crime drama on to the screen. Stylish editing, novel camera movements and slow-motion don't draw any attention from the story, but it enhances the fear that the characters are going through. The visual style adds just another layer of intensity to already a suspenseful story and wonderful acting works. Three hours pass quickly and the viewers are kept on the edge of their seats while the story progresses.Magnificent and thrilling drama. Unfortunately, this sort of true-life dramas on epic proportions is a thing from the past.",The Insider
179,awlauter,Interesting story,8,27 June 2000,"The Insider is filled with terrific acting, a good storyline and suspense. However, my friend and I both felt it was very drawn out and could have been condensed to make it more enjoyable.

At times I did think the movie dragged but overall it works well and I would recommend it to almost anyone.",The Insider
180,Snoopymichele,Riveting from start to finish,10,18 July 2006,"This is a movie that I was on the fence about seeing, simply because it seemed like just another movie about a whistle blower. It is so much more than that, and it is a movie worth watching time and again because of its complexity. It is about journalistic integrity, corporate greed, good vs. evil, and standing up for what you believe in, no matter what the cost. It pulls no punches about how far the tobacco industry would go to hide the truth from the American public about cigarettes, but it never seems propagandized.Russell Crowe gives a top-notch performance of Everyman scientist Jeffrey Wigand that meets Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer's portrayals of 60 Minutes Hotshots Lowell Bergman and Mike Wallace frame by frame. These three actors have the perfect blend of chemistry and timing, and fit their characters like a glove. They completely inhabit their roles and at times it seems more like a documentary than a fictional story.From beginning to end, it has the kind of edge of your seat tension that keeps one glued to the screen. Despite being a fairly lengthy film, it moves at a quick pace, and is absolutely riveting. The direction is superb, the camera angles are fast and furious, and it is a delight to watch.",The Insider
181,Kop_Reaz,Disappointing and Satisfying,7,15 August 2014,"If you think it's a crime/ action/ thriller, you'll be disappointed. It's more like a documentary. Yes DOCUMENTARY. In fact if you look at the top of the title page of The Insider in IMDb, you'll notice that it says Biography|Drama|Thriller. So don't nag about how boring the movie is!The main plot is very interesting. The Insider tells the story of a former top researcher of a big tobacco company Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe), who is approached by Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino), producer of CBS News' TV show ""60 Minutes"", when Bergman learned that Wigand wanted to blow the whistle on his former employers. The dramatization of the original story fits nicely. But the screenplay holds back the story. Probably only average thing about the movie.Director Michael Mann was between good and very good. Same goes for Al Pacino. But Russell Crowe was very good. The film editing could have been better. Score and sound editing were amazing.So The Insider managed to win 7 Oscar nominations. But lost all of them. Now why is that? Was it a conspiracy against the movie by the tobacco companies? Or there were better movies? I myself believe that the film lacked the final touch. Something to push it past the finish line. May be a remake of the film can fix all the flaws and claim it's rightful place.",The Insider
182,fiozinho,Two stools.,6,1 February 2000,"A magnificent, sublimely restrained performance from Russell Crowe as the unfortunate but heroic insider of the title and excellent, moody atmosphere à la 'All the President's Men' do not quite dispel a sense of a big chance lost here: the chance to have a modern classic on our hands. So what is missing? Well, we should rather ask what is there too much of? And the answer, in my opinion, is perspectives. The writer and director have taken a true story (the cover up by powerful tobacco interests of health risk from smoking) and looked at it from the p.o.v. of both the snitch (Crowe) and the investigative journalist (Pacino) who fights editorial corruption to follow up the story, and more or less equal weight is given to each. I would suggest that by far the more interesting of the two stories is that of the snitch, the common man whose conscience is so heavy (and bitterness so strong) that he even sacrifices his beloved family to get the truth out. As it is, the stories of the two men kind of trip each other up; perhaps there was even material here for two films. Whatever, it's certainly an immensely absorbing and at times very moving account of common (and not so common) people caught up in a shameful moment in American corporate history.",The Insider

But first off, this movie is so interesting that it didn't seem much longer than the typical 90 minute flick.  And as many dramas are, this film may be a little slow in some parts, but I never lost interest, not once.  Crowe was great, and I was impressed by Pacino's performance, who I've admittedly lost confidence in over the last decade or so.  Probably his best in many years.  Granted, most ""based on a true story"" films fictionalize 90% of the film (i.e. Titanic, Perfect Storm), but this movie was still loyal to the basic truths.

That would have brought the length down...to about 5 minutes.Far and away the most interesting thing about this film is that critics loved it. If that doesn't tell you something about the rancidity of the movie industry, nothing will.I defy anyone to watch this movie the whole way through without yawning.

In ""A Beautiful Mind"", he shows the obvious sadness, he cries, weeps, and screams, but in ""The Insider"" he tries to stay strong while showing his sadness threw the not so obvious ways. Like sitting down in a chair, but good old Michael Mann will show you that he's going mad in some way. Mann shows a scene where he's looking at his children, but his children are not there, he's really looking at a wall.Crowe's Oscar winning performance(Gladiator) is not nearly as good his performance in this film, or even ""A Beautiful Mind"", but he brought back the sandle movie saga, and redefined what a Gladiator really is.  He is one of the greatest actors of our time, he deserves to be compared to the all time greats, like Marlon Brando, and Richard Burton, and he needs to be compared to the elites, Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise, Robert De niro, Al Pacino, and Tom Hanks.This film is incredible, and I give it ****(out of 4 stars).",The Insider

Not that they look terribly similar, but he truly embodies the veteran ""60 Minutes"" reporter in a terrific performance, and he's just the icing on the cake.Russel Crowe, delivering another riveting performance (and Oscar-nominated) is Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist recently fired from the tobacco company he worked at because he figured out that nicotine is indeed addictive, while the company's official stance on the subject is otherwise. Crowe, with white hair and makeup, looks like hes in his fifties, but he was really only about 34. Honestly, I often forget just how young he is given his roles.Al Pacino delivers the standard Pacino acting job as Lowell Bergman, the former ""60 Minutes"" producer who wants Wigand to be a whistle-blower. He understands that Wigand is being threatened, but he doesn't anticipate CBS not wanting to air the interview. This puts Wigand in danger, and destroys his family life in the process. Pacino doesn't really look or sound anything like the real Lowell Bergman, but his acting talent works for the movie anyway.Michael Mann achieves another triumph with this fact-based account of recent history. He displays what some corporations will do to keep people quiet, and how network politics can ruin a life.",The Insider

Curiosly set in the 19th century England with an incredible cast with Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft or John Hurt. John Hurt embodies John Merrick, a very disfigured young man, is victim of savage treatment and obligated to participate in freak shows. At one time, doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins) rescues him and takes him with him to his Hospital. There he gets very well treated, despite several incidental occurrences, now that he bumps into a whole new experience, being exposed to the society, not as an animal but as a sick person. Brilliant how Lynch empowers one's humanity and personality from his physical semblance, always keeping our stupid practise to despise and dehumanize the abnormal alive reaching a stunning level of contrast. Never seen one like it. This movie is both emotional and medically great. Notice that even Dr Treves starts to use Merrick as an awesome target for enhancing his reputation around medical community, until he notices his great intellectual capabilities. The Elephant Man also very elucidative of Lynch's career. The whole movie portrays how Human life roams around fear and how it explains both lacking and excess of power, as strategy of defense or submission to avoid pain. 9/10",The Insider

And many of the forces at play here: big tobacco, network conglomerates, corporate lawyers, are still very much in evidence in the media/political landscape of today. One has to wonder how many other Jeffrey Wiegands are at this moment, slipping through those cracks. It's a  gripping, compelling story.Russell Crowe is amazing as Wiegand (write down Best Actor nominee right now). Not only does he look like him, but all traces of his heavy Australian accent are gone. Al Pacino shows us yet another shade in his multi-faceted repertoire, and is fascinating to watch. Director Michael Mann gives us his usual interesting tableau: visually arresting shots, quick cuts.

190,garage5inc,Nothing to lose,10,14 November 2002,"The Insider is what I like to call a ""political thriller"". This is overall a great movie about the topic with perfect characters, good direction, and an entertaining screenplay.Jeff Wingand (Russell Crowe) plays a paranoid research scientist who has just lost his job at a major tobacco company. Jeff soon loses his wife's trust in him and is on the verge of losing his family if he can't pay the bills and give his family dental care and health care which they need. Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a news reporter from the show 60 Minutes who travels all around the world to get stories from some of the most dangerous people, he is willing to do absolutely anything to get the complete story. When Lowell calls Jeff up and asks him if he can go over a simple report on flame resistances that involve cigarette burns, Lowell gets more than he bargained for. Jeff secretly hints that he knows a lot about the tobacco companies, so much he could bring them down himself if he had a chance in court. Lowell wants Jeff's full story at any costs because it would be the story of the year. Jeff has signed a waver though with his former company that he can not release any research information to the public or else they can financially hurt him or physically hurt him by any means nesscarry.The Insider starts out with a sample of Lowell's work as he travels to an Arabic country to get a report from an alleged terrorist leader, this is obviously very interesting to today's crowd. Russell Crowe plays his part perfectly as the paranoid scientist in that the way he talks, acts, and moves. Russell's character is always worried that his former tobacco company is going to hurt him and his family, and every instance he gets a hint of it he acts immediately in strange ways which are very interesting to watch. Al Pacino masters his role, just as he does for all his roles, there are no flaws in the acting in this movie. However the movie does exceed the three hour mark and tends to run a little slow near the end, but you'll be dying to see the conclusion because of all the hype about the release of the story during the movie.Michael Mann's movies are always fun to watch and this is no exception, this is his best work since Heat with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

These are essentially feel-good movies; the perspective is that of a highly simplified morality play where good and evil are radically drawn. But this particular presentation is so expertly delivered that it blows your mind. The whole thing is composed with extreme care and grace. There is a harmony among writing, acting, music and photography that is unequalled in my experience. This is one of the finest American films ever made.The point the film makes is that tobacco companies go to great lengths to deliberately make an addict of every consumer, and they go to equally great lengths to conceal the nature of their actions from the authorities as well as the public. In this film, both Crowe and Pacino's characters become ""insiders"" at some point, and each man is forced to confront his conscience and make a choice between his career and conscience.

In fact,THE INSIDER is very different than Heat and go beyond,the tobacco story in only a pretext,this is a film over the courage about responsibility of our actions.A great screenplay a great story! Russel Crowe show us how is hard do be coherent and honest in life.Al Pacino makes again a great work,and I'm thinking why have no Nomination?Maybe bacause he have no more space on shelves at home? About Mann styles,the music is used in a perfect way.Almost obsessive is SACRIFICE.Like HEAT's score there were using 2 tracks ARMENIA and IN NOVEMBER both too great for be forget. On Remind's Children scene a music is mixed with MELTDOWN and give a great emotion and that is what I call Mann's Movie!

I've never walked out of a movie and i rarely turn one off before its done, but this was so BORING and without any form of emotion other than anger. All we really see is Al Pacino (in a role he's played a million times before) and Russel Crowe, who looks like a small water animal who cant fight for himself, banter at each other for some kind of betrayl.

202,klesker,A great Great Movie,9,6 October 2003,"After watching all of Michael Mann's movies i can say that he has never made a bad film. Although i have to dissagree with the bulk of his fans and say that this film is his best NOT Heat (it was still an awesome movie).I think my opinion of this film is slightly bias as i am a Huge fan of Al Pacino but even if they got an equally great actor for the same roll, it wouldn't cause this masterpiece to falter in any way.On the outset this does not look like an amazingly gripping film. The true story of a tabaco executive turned whistle blower doesn't make it sound as if it'll be ripe with action or suspence (which the average popcorn junkie craves). That said it's not action you go to see in a Michael Mann film. Even with Heat he brilliantly put characterisation first before the relentlessly violent action set pieces and he keeps the theme going here.There is no action to speak of in this film, just the agonising tension that builds from the moment Wigand (Russel Crowe on top form) is fired from his job and it doesn't let up.Pacino is his usual shouty self but that is what makes him so great. His role as 60 minutes producer Lowel Burhman is brilliantly played out as a man who can't take no for an answer. Watch his noticable dispair as he realises that they will NOT broadcast the show.There is nothing bad about this movie. Mann's direction is his best since the brilliant and gripping Manhunter. His use of slow motion is enough to make the Wachowski brothers quiver in their boots. Many of my friends complained about the length (over 2 1/2 hours) but these are the pop corn junkies i spoke of before. I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the cinema where the full glory of the cinematography was amazingly apparent.All in all this is a true masterpiece. Interlectual (which is rare in a film today), gripping, and truely truely fantastic in every sense of the word. This is by far Mann's best work to date and if he churns more gems out like this i will be a fan for many years to come.5/5",The Insider

She is portrayed as a selfish woman only interested in the status of her life.  A small role, but well done.  Was she really like that? So why did he stay with her?I wonder how factual the scenes about Mike Wallace (6o minutes host) were We see him give in to the cover up, but when one of his TV editorials is edited down he loses it and again supports the struggle to get the truth out.Similarly, the TV station looks bad trying to cover up in the cause of money.It's a shame that we, as the human race, have such little integrity.",The Insider
205,CHendri887,"Pretentious, over-serious, over-acted",6,24 July 2001,"In The Insider Michael Mann exposes the big bad evil of corporate America. Not that anyone would have realized that the tobacco industry was just trying to make people addicted to nicotine in order to sell more of their product without watching this hard-hitting docudrama expose.  And in case you don't get this message in the first fifteen minutes of the film, Mann goes to great detail to drum it into you in every other scene.  For example, we are shown--over and over and over-- the scene where Jeff Wigand (played so constipatedly by Russell Crowe) is being interviewed by Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes while a camera softly pans the other characters' faces again and again as they poignantly watch the interview.  I guess this is supposed to be like, a collective realization for all of us that yes, corporate America is evil and we, innocent the American citizens and liberal media have been duped by this evil force.  Yes, Michael, I understand.  Big tobacco = bad. Liberal media and American citizens = good victims.  Deep.  Very, very deep, Michael Mann.  And I really dug the way Mann used the handheld camera for 3/4ths of the film, making some scenes so jumpy that I was wondering if the characters had nervous ticks or were jumping up and down for the camera.  It was just like, so realistic and raw.  And I really enjoyed the post-1960s Baby Boomer guilt of Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman.  It's like, ""Yes, I am a Yuppie who has a mulimillion dollar job, house, and life in New York city, but I relieve my 1960s liberal guilt by saying Herbert Marcuse was my mentor and proclaiming myself a 'liberal journalist.'""  Wow.  I guess that makes everything OK.  And then there was Al Pacino's screaming like 50% of his lines in the film.  That really brought out the ""meaningfulness"" of the whole ""liberal media fighting evil corporate America"" theme.  And I just liked the way most of the characters were really unempathic to one another's nurturing needs, especially during the moments when they needed to cry or be held.  It's always great to see Hollywood churn out another damaging image-fest where there's lots of yelling, advice giving, and abandonment when characters need to listen to one another.  It really excites me when these images are held up for the whole world to see (especially when the images proclaim themselves to be examples of ""real life"" behavior, as in this flick) so kids and adults alike can imitate them and unconsciously internalize the oligarchical/patriarchal power structures which they represent.  There were a few nice moments in the soundtrack--the opera piece stands out for me here--but overall, that ended up coming across as pretentious as well.  I am definitely not in tune with the ""Academy.""  I can't believe this film was nominated for 9 awards.",The Insider

It is really amazing that this film even got made.  Russell Crow surely deserved the nod over Kevin Spacey for best actor.  It was one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.  My only gripe at all was Michael Mann's style of photography in the film.

How thin can one's integrity be stretched before you can no longer live with yourself? These are just a sample of the themes explored in Michael Mann's engrossing ""The Insider"", a parallel examination of former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand's whistleblowing 1996 testimony against corporate giant Brown & Williamson, and ""60 Minutes"" segment producer Lowell Bergman's struggle to expose Wigand's sobering evidence to the public. The screenplay's structure is intriguing: as we follow Wigand's back-against-the-wall attempt to reclaim a modicum of self-respect after years of looking the other way, he concurrently loses all of the treasures, both meaningful and materialistic, he has accumulated in his career. Comparatively, as Bergman struggles to bring to light Wigand's shocking revelations, his once-united front of journalistic truth crumbles as his ""60 Minutes"" colleagues cave in to the potentially devastating legal ramifications of revealing to the public information that Wigand is forbidden to share. All of the Mann touches are here: the good (muted wide-screen compositions, unusual soundtrack selections) and not-so-good (too-frequent hand-held shots, overlength, underwritten female roles). In any event, this trenchant true story (despite some dramatic license and composite characters) is well-served, particularly by Crowe (nearly unrecognizable as Wigand) and Pacino (convincing as the relentless Bergman). So focused are these two, whether together on-screen or apart, they are never less than riveting.",The Insider
208,Ken-120,A dramatic illustration of the Manufacturing of Consent,8,6 November 1999,"This is one of the finest films I've ever seen, and one of the most important of the year. It illustrates the cold bloodedly greedy ruthlessness of the tobacco industry and the dire implications of big media taking money as a priority over the truth.It's almost surreal, but all too creditble, to see a big corporation act like a thug, openly threatening people, using their own families as de facto hostages to get their silence.  However, that didn't surprise me considering I have read about these hoodlums' antics in at least one book called ""Merchants of Death"" which also illustrated the underhanded tactics of these jokers.   Also see them threatening to sue CBS for broadcasting the truth and the truth itself only makes the case worse is a bizarre echo of the famous Peter Zenger case. In the 17th century American colonies in which truth for a supposed libel printed by a newspaper publisher was not considered a defense back then and it took a brilliant lawyer representing Zenger to change that.  There are many things we have to deal with in our times, but refighting the Zenger case in the civil law sphere should not be one of them.  However, what was even more ominous was the waffling of CBS News as they buckle to corporate pressure.  What you see in this film illustrate the very same tactics that major media critics like Noam Chomsky have noted that big media is prone to do.  For instance, the censoring of Mike Wallace's interview about being censored was excused on the basis on time constraints. This is what Chomsky has noted as the tactic of ""concision"" where time constraints are use to limit debate and discussion to make you have to speak only pat & bland statements because to say something really unexpected and new would simply too much time to explain between commercials.  In short, this film is an excellent companion to the film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992).This film is a real eye opener and an absolute must to anyone who wants to know was both big business and big media are capable of doing.",The Insider

It was a bit long, and I guess the subject matter wasn't exactly up my alley. Also, something that always sticks in my craw: isn't it time that directors hire talented actresses like Lindsay Crouse (here in the thankless faithful wife role) and Debi Mazar (as the competent, trusted office assistant), and actually give them more than glorified walk-on roles? You'd never know either one was anything special by watching them in this, but that's nothing new for women in Hollywood of course.

It's just such a shame there aren't more of these: serious adult dramas.What next from Michael Mann ? He seems to be batting 1000 in my book. We'll see how he tackles a complex subject like Ali later this year, but fortunately for us, he has given what may be the best movie of the 90s.I do not know how R.Crowe does it, but somehow he captured the essence of an otherwise normal, scientific everyman put into a pressure cooker and forced to squirm out from underneath it. The scene in the hotel room, when he and Al Pacino first meet: this is such a wonderful scene. Full of subtle clues and clever and affecting writing/direction and acting. Watch how Lowell (Pacino) who knows nothing about Jeffrey (Crowe) and what he has to say measures him and equally impressive is Jeffrey's nervous assertion of Lowell. At one point later in the film, Jeffery remarks he cannot find the parameters to effectively make a decision. Spoken like a true man of science. His crumbling under the weight of his life is entirely palpable as is Lowell steadfast resolve to stick to his guns, despite being under his own legal and professional stress.I could go on and on but I won't except to say that I hope Michael Mann and his team continue to create excellent dramatic stories that require us, the viewer, to use our brains and watch the movie with patience and attention.",The Insider

213,masonx,Infamy lasts a little longer,8,15 February 2000,"One of the phrases uttered by one of Michael Manns characters in this fine depiction of a whistleblower within the tobacco industry, Jeffrey Wigand played by ""kiwi-born, aussie-raised"" actor Russell Crowe. In the beginning its not a difficult story to grasp. The good and bad guys are pretty much defined early on. The tobacco conglomerates are the bad guys of course. Even the smokers would agree with that. One day Wigand decides to divulge some of his former employers more questionable production practises to the media. Here the media is represented in the form of hard driving '60 minutes' producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Everything goes well until one day journalistic ethics clash with corporate priorities, then its all on. Enough said.What to me could have been a boring 165-minute docudrama turns into a gripping story as it delves into ethics in the press and the angst and moral dilemmas which sometimes occupies our top news staff. Some would say not enough angst. The performances are exceptional and the principals, Pacino and Crowe have received worthy mention but some of the supporting cast also give of fine studied portrayals of their characters who are people still living. Gina Gershon deserves credit as an icy corporate lawyer, and Christopher Plummer as 'Mike Wallace' gets it down pat. The arrogance, the humbleness is all there.  Mike Wallace also gets all the best lines. But although his character comes out flawed in places to me that showed him as more human, not the brusque interviewer we see on TV, and consequently more likeable.  Not my pick for Best Picture this year but a worthy candidate to stand beside the top five. Bravo.",The Insider

This movie had me on edge the whole way.  Outstanding performances, especially from Christopher Plummer.  His turn on Mike Wallace is unforgettable. This Actor is IN THE ZONE!  Al Pacino makes it look eeeeaaasy, and Russell Crowe transcends his dialect struggles (he goes with a mishmash of ""American"" dialect, and at times I found it a little distracting), but he scores with his understated Pressure Cooker character development. The screenplay and writing is wonderful, as are many supporting roles.  If you haven't seen this one, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",The Insider
215,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,More than an interesting take on interesting events.,8,14 July 2001,"The Insider is a film in which people talk. A lot. They talk over dinner, they talk in cars and more often than not they talk on the phone. And yet it never bored me for a second. The main reasons: an intelligent, grown-up screenplay that never gives in to cheap entertainment, Michael Mann's spectacularly sweeping yet semi-documentarylike direction and, of course, the great performances.Michael Mann and Eric Roth based this tale of the modern day David-versus-Goliath battle between whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and faceless sigarette juggernaut Brown & Williamson (and journalistic integrity) on a Vanity fair article. It has led to a powerful script, not only succeeding in showing the issues it deals with, both also (or perhaps most of all) succeeding in telling the emotionally captivating story of Wigand himself. The film's certainly aided by Russell Crowes masterful performance, but the writing itself deserves attention for being emotionally gripping without ever being sentimental and for keeping the drama real (although it's basic story is fictionalised, of course). However, the only problem I have with this film also lies within the script. About 100 minutes into the film shifts its perspective from Wigand to Lowell Bergman, the producer on 60 Minutes, who's trying to get Wigand's testimony to the screens. A lot of people have already pointed this out as The Insider's main flaw, and I'd have to agree. Wigand is the tragic figure of the story, not Bergman, Wigand is making all the sacrifices, he's having his life ruined for telling the truth, not Bergman. Wigand's ordeal is far more captivating than Bergman's and therefore I would have preferred it if the film had continued focussing on Wigand. The fact that Crowe is absolutely brilliant and Pacino merely very good, doesn't help either.As for directing, I think Mann is becoming better and better. I never really liked his older films. I remember seeing The Keep and being...well, baffled. I remember seeing Manhunter and although I enjoyed it, something didn't work for me. It always felt like style over content. With Heat however, Mann won me over. And with the Insider he proves he is still evolving as a director. The Insider looks great like any other of his films, but much like in Heat, style never overshadows content. It's always there to enhance the mood of a scene. The same goes for his genius use of a genius soundtrack (by Pieter Bourke and Lisa Gerrard). Still, the most amazing thing is the Mann's masking of the fact that this film is all talk.Finally, there's the acting. I said it twice, and will say it again. Crowe is perfect as Wigand. He brings across every emotion not so much through words, but through facial expressions and body language. And he never does it in a way that is noticable as being 'acted'. Also, Crowe looks the role, having put on more than a few extra pounds. Watch this in conjunction with, say, L.A. Confidential, or Gladiator and you'll see Crowe is a total actor, a chameleon almost. And although he got a deserved Oscar for Gladiator, his performance here is more finely tuned. Pacino, on the other hand, is very good, but he's not exactly doing anything new. He's convincing but in certain scenes comes close to the overacting more suitable for The Devil's Advocate. The supporting actors are all good or better.In short: Until the perspective shifts an emotionally powerful, highly intelligent, brilliantly acted and directed film, after the shift the 'emotionally powerful' is confined to the few scenes Crowe has left and the 'brilliantly acted' makes way for simply 'very well acted'. Still, I love the first part so much (and like the second part enough) that I can't rate this any lower than 9/10.",The Insider
216,morningkeith,"A cool, intelligent film, well told.",9,23 October 2001,"This is a cool movie, with a fascinating style.  Unlike in his gangster films, Al Pacino here doesn't once fire a pistol; his cell phone and the sword of truth are his weapons this time.  But his passion is just as real.
Michael Mann follows Pacino's character, Lowell Bergmann, from a view inside a world that is constantly swirling, with other characters who are constantly approaching, then receding away.  And so it is that the enigmatic whistle blower, played by Russell Crowe, remains an enigma, and the truth itself remains more slippery than solid.Cool movie.  Worth seeing.",The Insider

The viewer will be faced with ethical dilemma's - should he speak out about the terrible truth surrounding the industry or should he remain quite and protect his family?

What made it especially great is that it didn't rely solely on action and explosions to boost its interest level, as most movies out there do, but instead it chose to lean on tension to keep the audience riveted.  Not only did I find the movie extremely interesting, I found myself learning a thing or two about television production and tobacco companies.  I felt extreme sympathy for Jeffrey Wigand as he struggled to reveal the truth about tobacco to the American public.  Russell Crowe may have misstepped in Mystery, Alaska, but he is back to the height of his acting in The Insider, a powerful performance rivaling the one he gave in L.A. Confidential.  Al Pacino was fabulous as well.  I know that this film was early in release, but I hope that when Oscar nominations come out that this film is not forgotten.  This movie is one that is completely rewarding, and its use of tension as the source of interest for the audience should be use in more movies that are being made.",The Insider
220,Cochese-6,The Best Film of the Year,9,19 November 1999,"""The Insider"" is the best film of 1999. (""Fight Club ""comes close, though) Michael Mann's direction is in your face, and he develops the story perfectly. He succeds in making both of the two main leads very real and complete characters, which can be very difficult, especially since he also brought out strong performances with the supporting cast (Especially Christopher Plummer). The cinematography is excellent, and Pacino and Crowe should be nominated for their performances. (Which I assure you, they will be) Even though the film is basically all talk, it never loses your attention. (The cinematography has alot to do with that) The film runs close to three hours long and you feel it, but I think it was entirely necessary in order for you to get the feel for what the characters were going through. Mann and Pacino maintain the same great chemistry that they had in 1995's ""Heat.""

222,thomas.meagher,Compelling story of 60 Minutes & Big Tobacco,9,7 June 2000,"Faults; The film starts covering the life of the Insider - Dr. Wigand, played by R. Crowe. But the film ends focused upon Al Pacino's character - the 60 Minutes producer - Lowell Bergman.                       In the end, it would have been stronger to wrap up the Insider's human story more fully. What works; Pacino gives a strong performance, as well a Crowe. The story of intrigue keeps one on the edge of their seat wondering how the Insider will manage to testify under the pressures mounted by his old employer. The added twist of CBS caving to money interests and pressure, thickens and intensifies the plot.Powerful consequences: Reviewers mention how well the film depicts big tobacco. Perhaps true, but what is most impactful, is how the film portrays the behind-the-scenes of 60 minutes. This film was only lightly marketed because of complaints from CBS and Mike Wallace. In June of 2000 - years after the film was made - Don Hewitt of CBS gave a speech to 1000 journalists filled with angry rhetoric for Lowell Bergman. Mr. Bergman - a former 60 Minutes producer - is the person Al Pacino plays in the film, and who consulted on the film when made.

223,anchorman360,Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!,10,13 July 2009,The first time I saw this movie I just thought it would be a very boring and slow movie. However I actually thought this was a very compelling movie even though it goes by very slowly. Unlike Mann's other movies like Heat and Collateral I really loved this one the first time I saw it. In my opinion this is one of Pacino's best movies and Crowe gives his best performance which is even better and the complete opposite of his character in LA Confidential. This is Mann's best movie and my third all time favorite behind Zodiac and Pulp Fiction. Despite Pacino struggling to get the interview aired he makes being a producer for 60 minutes seem like it would be a very fun job to have. I really think Crowe should have won best actor and the movie should have won best picture because like a lot of other great movies you'll never get tired of watching it.,The Insider

This type of story has been done many times in the past, Silkwood, and Norma Rae come to mind. I don't understand why Russell Crowe was nominated and not Pacino. I think the voters get used to our best actors and actresses always doing such a good job, that when a younger newer actor stands out people fall all over them.

It's frustrating to see that the truth (at first) doesn't seem to be valuable enough.Here in Austria we also had a big dispute a few years back. Every cigarette pack contained the wording ""cigaretttes MAY cause health problems"". It took a long time and a lot of litigation to get that ""may"" out of the sentence, because cigarettes are dangerous. After this movie, reconsider smoking or even investing in cigarette-related companies.Go see this movie, for not only is the story good, but also the acting is truly phenomenal.

However, Michael Mann directs a film that captured me from beginning to end and never once did I feel restless throughout the entire three hours.We all know the story and probably most know how it ends.  This film is about standing up in the midst of strong opposition and doing what one feels is the right thing to do.  This theme is often portrayed in cheesy sitcoms and dopey films, but this film shows how much of a struggle it was for Wigand and how he almost gave up doing anything at all, making him all the more human and inspiring.  Michael Mann's film shows Wigand as a human being, rather than an idealized hero.Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career, which is saying a lot since he has continually impressed me with outstanding performances.  His work, along with the rest of the actors besides Basinger, on ""L.A. Confidential was ridiculously shut out of most award nominations.  Although Basinger did a great job, Crowe was just as deserving of recognition.  I believe he will give Kevin Spacey a huge run for his money when Oscar night comes around.  Spacey, Crowe, and Carrey will all battle it out for what may be one of the most intense Best Actor competitions in recent memory.Al Pacino gives his usual powerful performance and, since this is expected, his fabulous work will probably gain little fanfare in terms of nominations.One complaint about the film: it the last 20 or so minutes of the movie, Wigand is completely forgotten and Pacino's character becomes the central focus.  This seemed to shift the movie in an entirely different direction and it seemed to run of course.Overall, an excellent film that will compete heavily with ""American Beauty"" as the best movie of the year.",The Insider

It is a raw, powerful, engaging experience, with Pacino and Crowe at the top of their game (as well as a fine supporting turn by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace) providing masterful compliments to Mann's blistering direction.

I couldn't watch her on screen without wanting to punch her in the face for those stupid commercials.  But I digress.Al Pacino gives an amazingly understated performance as the producer of 60 Minutes who gets Wigand's story on the air.

The story is of a quick-paced nature, and demands that the viewer pay the utmost attention to every single line and image presented;  it flabbergasts in its unparallelled structure of continuity and coherence to those sentient enough.After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in ""Gladiator"" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand.  It appears more or less as if Crowe had been this character in reality, and it really inspires to see that such a talented actor is finally beginning to  enjoy the prominence that he deserves.In the past decades, there has been a progressive decline in the number of intelligent films making it onto the market, but the success of ""The Insider"" will hopefully serve as a shout-out to all the film companies and directors reluctant to tread on such sensitive ground.

Michael Mann has done a fantastic work. He throws the viewer into a voyage filled with constant tension, the hallmark of every good thriller. Ok, being based on a true story makes somewhat easier the job of the director - we can easily identify with the characters, because (that´s my case) we imagine ourselves in their shoes and think, ""Wow, what would I do if I were him/her?""The plot, full of twists, is frighteningly familiar to all of us with some sense of reality. That´s the real world, folks. Powerful men and institutions don´t give a dime about any of us, simple mortals. We are merely the tools they use to get richer and more powerful and that´s it.Once in a decade or so, and out of millions, comes someone who goes about his/her business with a tremendous sense of justice and righteousness. The Insider is about two of such persons, two men - whether or not the real story is exactly like that, it does not matter. But I have a feeling that whatever happenned in real life may very well be close to this movie.Al Pacino, as usual (I have no words to characterize his acting - superb, out of this world, to be remembered, the master of masters, someone who breathes acting like others breathe air), fantastic. He is older, one can see that, he looks a little bit tired, but what a tremendous performance this man has achieved.Mr. Russel Crowe...his performance is worth a nomination for an oscar. He is strong, fragile, cold, emotionally unstable, a loving father, a knight who fights for justice, knowledgeable, a good friend...what a character, and what a performance. He is the main emotional engine of this movie, and has made it big. He is a nominee for this year´s oscar, together with one of the greatest actors alive - Denzel Washington. He has a definite chance of winning this one, but it will be tough.The rest of the cast...Plummer, the great actor, is his usual self-centered man who goes nuts when someone ""screws"" with him...pardon my english.Good soundtrack, also.I thank Michael Mann, the actors and the studio behind them, for bringing us (the public) their vision of the events surrounding the discovery that tobacco companies are playing with every smoker´s life...and everyone´s life, by the way.

Even before this film came out, I never wanted to smoke, mostly due to my asthma, and more recently, because it just killed my grandma (after being a 40 year smoker, until finally quitting when I was 17, I'm 33 now!)I saw how it affected her, until her agonizing last breathe, and the tobacco industry still infuriates me, because of that! The fact that the industry cares more about money than health issues, despite how harmful their product is, lied about it, threatened Wigand and CBS, makes my blood just boil! Please understand me: I do like this film, but I haven't watched it recently because of just loosing my grandma, I can watch certain scenes, but not the whole thing, I'm just not ready.",The Insider
237,Carl Tano,"Great acting great story, great movie",8,2 July 2001,"The Insider is without a doubt a masterpiece.  Two of the absolute finest actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, are both at the peak of their game in this incredible movie. I was especially impressed by Russell Crowe who I think is even better in this movie than he was in Gladiator. The acting really brings this movie to the even greater heights, but I think it really needed supreme acting since it's so important that the characters in the movie are well portrayed because the movie is very realistic, and the way the people respond to the things that happen to them in the story is very realistic.The story of the movie is also done very well and even though the movie surpasses 2 hrs and 30 minutes it never even gets close to get tiring or boring because of the extremely entertaining story which is consistently being delivered at a very constant high pace, so there is never a dull moment.  It's a movie that stirs up great anger towards the tobacco company, and it's the type of movie who leaves me as a non-smoker asking myself: Don't already people know it's no good for yourself to smoke, so then why is it so special when new information about the tobacco-companies is released? That's a question I don't know the answer for.I think the movie is entertaining because of the acting and because of the way Russell Crowe's character is being chased by tobacco companies and, the sad part is that those kind of things do actually happen, you sometimes hear about smoking documentaries not being able to air because of anonymous threats.  This movie is a great way of showing how criminal the tobacco companies actually are.",The Insider
238,Nedla24,Excellent,8,19 December 1999,"In a year that has boasted great commercial success but little artistic achievement, Michael Mann has directed a solid, well-crafted gem.  A wonderful cast, that includes Al Pacino in a more subtle character than his recent movies, Russel Crowe delivering big-time in a complex character, and Christopher Plummer who is nearly flawless as Mike Wallace, is what drives this movie.  Unfortunately Mann's direction is a tad too stylized.  Mann favors the ""behind the ear"" camera angle too much, and the overuse of jump-cuts becomes tiresome toward the middle of the movie.  Toward the end of the movie, Mann relaxes his narcissistic techniques that supposedly ""define a director"" and simply tells the story, thus redeeming his past mistakes.  The story is well worth telling.  Lost in the wake of the OJ Simpson verdict, this true and riveting tale of morals, big business, red-tape, and perseverance is now being told with incredible dramatic force by this talented crew of artists to those that will listen.  The script, the movie, Plummer, the cinematography, and perhaps Mann will be nominated for an academy award.  In a weak year such as this, both Pacino and Crowe could receive nominations for Best Actor though the bronze statuette is sole possession of Kevin Spacey for American Beauty.  This is an excellent movie, it may end up being one of the top 5 of the year, but only Plummer might end up taking home an Oscar.  Definitely worth the cost of admission, but be prepared, it's reeeeeeeally long.",The Insider
239,636,Al Pacino gave a commanding performance,8,21 December 1999,"I remember barking at the tv when all those CEO's of the tobacco companies lied. I remember watching tv and seeing Dr. Wigand on Sixty Minutes and I thought to myself ""What a courageous man!"". When I heard about""The Insider"" I said to myself you have got to see that film. I did just that today. This is not your typical movie showing the latest in computer graphics so it will not appeal to everyone. For those who enjoy a behind the scenes look at events that have occurred in real life then check it out.I really feel that things are far more evil than even this film intimates. I do hope that lawyers can be tried for war crimes against humanity. Gina Gershon played one superbly and she was supposed to be one of the good guys. Dr. Wigand put everything on the line to do the right thing. What gets me in this insane world is that the whistle blowers are given no protection at all. They are expected to do the right thing and then take it in the ear. And guys like Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano who has admitted to killing 30 plus people in cold blood gets witness protection, plastic surgery and the right to keep his ill gotten gains. Where the hell is protection for the whistle blowers that are trying to protect us from greedy, amoral and thorughly ruthless b****rds that run corporate America and multi-national corporations. Logic would dictate that we help out the whistle blowers. Luckily for Dr. Wigand things worked out sort of. Unhappily for us the tobacco industry seems to be stronger than ever. This film is really important for the outstanding commanding powerful performance of Al Pacino. If for no other reason Al Pacino's character in this movie stands for a person who is as good as his word. He in short has integrity in a world that has lost even the knowledge of what that word ever meant. If you are discouraged by the state of things then go see this movie because there are still a few good people out there.",The Insider

Al Pacino was his normally intense self, and Christopher Plummer was extremely believable as Mike Wallace (to the point you forgot it was Plummer portraying Wallace).  Fine job of acting, too, by Russell Crowe as Dr. Wigand.  [The only potential disaster was one of Dr. Wigand's daughters was that obnoxious little twirp from the Pepsi commercials.  Fortunately, she had a minor role and did not remind you of her Pepsi character.]The movie started slowly, but it did an excellent job building each of the characters.  Some very intense scenes.  A must see.",The Insider
241,Daff-4,"A good film, but not a great film",7,25 February 2000,"The Insider is certainly worth seeing.  It tells a fascinating story, boasts an impressive cast and is competently directed.  But that is all. 
Those people who have posted reviews on this site paying tribute to Michael Mann's genius' and claiming to have burst into tears' during the film, are obviously easily impressed (and/or emotionally unstable).  Don't get me wrong.  This is a good film, it's just not a great one. 
The film's main asset is, obviously, the true story upon which it is based. The lengths to which tobacco companies are prepared to go to suppress information and distort the truth was always going to make captivating viewing.  The question is, did the director capitalise on this and create an exceptional film?   I don't thing he did.  Michael Mann's directorial style reminds me of a kid who just got a new tool box for Christmas, but doesn't know how to use any of them.  The film is DRENCHED with dramatic pauses', meaningful slo mo's' and moving classical scores.'  Although such devices are often PRESENT in great films, they don't MAKE a film great.  It just depends on how they're used.  In this case, Michael Mann simply threw them in everywhere in the hope that people would walk out saying  `I mean, like, wow!  How good was that bit where the guy took 15 minutes to peel off his coat?  It was just so DEEP!'If anything, the overuse of these devices gave the film a slightly clinical, colourless feel, which detracted from its emotional impact.  I kept sitting there thinking I really SHOULD feel sorry for Jeffrey Wigand, but I just can't seem to empathise with him.' As for individual performances, I thought the stand out was Christopher Plummer.  His portrayal of veteran 60 minutes anchorman, Mike Wallace, was superb.  Russell Crowe was solid as Jeffrey Wigand, but didn't live up to the hype. Although the make-up team deserves full credit for ageing him twenty years (and Russell himself did well to stack on 10 or so kilos for the part), the acting itself was only fair.  Those of you who saw his brilliant performance in LA Confidential are bound to be disappointed.Al Pacino did well playing 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman', but it was a fairly two-dimensional role  tenacious, old school newsman, who plays it by the book and never breaks his word.'  All you really needed for the part was a good voice and a haggard face.  Al Pacino has these qualities in spades.  The only other performance worth mentioning was Diane Venora's portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand's wife.  I thought she was dreadful.  I have no idea what type of accent she was trying to pull off, but whatever it was, she failed. In summary, The Insider is a very solid film.  If you haven't seen it, I urge you to  not because its brilliantly made, but because it tells an important story.",The Insider
242,oh madeline,Direction and Editing -- The Lost Arts,2,16 August 2000,"Once again, Michael Mann illustrates clearly that has a film director, he sure knows how to do videos and car chases.  Some great performances -- Crowe & Plummer are standouts -- are wasted in this holier-than-thou docudrama which uses distance as a deadly weapon against its own characters. Disappointing because there were some excellent moments here, but far too much detached misanthropy.",The Insider
243,lisarull,How to make an action film with no action,9,3 September 2001,"This was undoubtedly the movie that Russell Crowe won the Academy Award for, since the Academy invariably hands the little oscar out for the wrong movie in the wrong part of someone's career.  (Not that Crowe's performance in ""Gladiator"" wasn't life changing for many - ahem - but ""The Insider"" was where he truly ACTED his socks off and then some.  And all power to the Academy for being only ONE year late; most actors wait till their twilight years to get their hands on the deserved statuette).It's a sublime piece of work from Mann, as his fans have come to expect - thoughtful, driven by well-written characters, intelligent scripting and wonderful direction.  But of course much of this story comes from the real-life inspiration of Mr Wigand and the 60 Minutes coverage of his whistle-blowing activities on the tobacco industry.  It is also a fantastic demonstration of how to make an action movie with NO action.  Well, not in the Jerry Bruckheimer sense of the word.  For man the action is all in the characters and the beautiful way that Pacino, Crowe and Plummer especially draw you in to their inner worlds.  For some, latter-day Pacino is just too much like prime ham - but here just give the movie a couple of viewings and you'll realise how well he acts.  It's a wonderful turn and utterly appropriate for a TV producer.If you want to see a gripping movie this might not be where you would instinctively turn, but trust me - just for the scenes on the golf course, and when Wigand is on the stand about to give his deposition (I climbed the sofa the tension was so immense!) - this film can provide excellent and stimulating 'action'.",The Insider
244,zza99tmk,Cinema at its very best,10,13 March 2000,"There are moments in life you never forget. I had such moments when seeing ""The Insider"". Though the storyline doesn't sound really exciting at first, it was a great surprise to find that Michael Mann has made a drama of overwhelming intensity and quality. The fact, that of all current ""based on a true story""- Hollywood films ""The Insider"" is the one which stirred upcontroversy the least, also shows that Mann was very precise in the treatment of the facts (note: there is no criticism of ""The Hurricane"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"" intended, simply because I haven't seen them yet and I don't forget that in adapting a true story for cinema it's simply necessary to compromise). ""The Insider"" convinces in nearly every detail: Manns direction is straight to the point and always finds the appropriate tone. There's always a feeling of danger and threat in his film, keeping the tension on a high level. Also worth to mention is how the film deals with questions on integrity and responsibility. Its depiction of the working procedures of the american corporation system is accurate and as Russell Crowe has put it in the Sunday Times interview, it is miles away from the paranoid conspiracy theories of the likes of Oliver Stone. That brings me to the actors: the supporting actors -among them Christopher Plummer and Philip Baker Hall (also to be seen in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Magnolia"") - are all very good and Al Pacino does a good job as Lowell Bergman, but the one who beats them all is Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe (who was already great in L.A.Confidential) is simply outstanding! I honestly think that Russell Crowe should get the oscar and not Kevin Spacey (well, Spacey is great in American Beauty, but he already got an academy award for The Usual Suspects). To me ""The Insider"" is just a perfect film and I already consider it as one of my alltime favourites. It is a real gem, flawless, essential. The very best film of the year. A well deserved 10!

The acting was top notch especially by Mann usuals Venora and Pacino, but also by Crowe, who did an Oscar worthy job in the main role, playing someone much older than himself convincingly. Visually, like all Mann films, it was experimental and breathtaking and the mood music perfectly complemented the colors and compositions of all the scenes. This film is also historically important for obvious reasons, and I felt that a biographical film like this is not usually given the thriller-drama that this film was given to such a quality degree, but Michael Mann never disappoints.

253,BlackMan90,"Well acted and directed, but poorly paced down the stretch.",8,3 March 2007,"Michael Mann's 'The Insider' is directed with technical precision and skillfully acted by numerous veterans in this well-made drama about the exposure of the tobacco industry.The film follows Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) & Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Wigand is a scientist who is fired after he finds out that the tobacco company he works for, chemically alters nicotine. Bergman is a producer for the CBS show '60 Minutes' who entices Wigand to speak out against the tobacco industry. Based on the Larie Brenner article 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', Eric Roth & Michael Mann write a thorough and enticing screenplay.Russell Crowe gives his best performance to date. His subtle and heartfelt performance anchors the film. Gaining ? pounds and greying his hair, Crowe transforms himself into this sympathetic character. We feel his anguish and pain. Al Pacino gives an underrated performance as Lowell Bergman. He is efficient & gets the job done, but he truly cares about the stories he works on and Pacino shows this perfectly. Crowe and Pacino play their parts perfectly and their character chemistry is great. Christopher Plummer gives a good, albeit overrated performance as Mike Wallace. Diane Venora gives a natural, underrated performance. Her chemistry with Russell Crowe and emotional depth give the film a heart. Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Colm Feore add veteran backup. This is an efficient cast, but the film loses steam when Crowe, Pacino, or Venore aren't on screen together.The cinematography, sound mixing, and editing gives the film a documentary feel to it. Michael Mann's rapid, fast-paced editing succeeds in making the film seem shorter than it actually is. Mann uses very small things to develop tension in between characters. The films only fault is the pacing down the line. It feels like it has several endings. But just as soon as it starts dragging, a key encounter occurs that grips you back into the film.

If anyone doesn't believe that the boardroom's of corporate America don't operate like this, they more than likely bet on professional wrestling matches too. Cigarettes are a delivery device for nicotine.  Does it have to be said any clearer?  And yet, we spend millions of public dollars to subsidize this industry, even after the industry admits it lied for years about its knowledge of the effects of smoking. In the future will the producer stand by his principles and be lucky enough to get the truth told or will we continue to live in ignorance of potential danger from products, people and organizations, because of the threat of lawsuits? This film should be mandatory viewing in every junior high school.  It should stimulate debate with our young people regarding lessons in health practices, economics, politics and ethics.  They will watch with interest because this is pretty well made movie.  Russel Crowe performance is outstanding in a group of excellent actors. The script is fairly solid. Although, I think I got a little bit confused toward the end of the film on where Bergman was and what it had to do with the plot.  However, this flaw didn't dull the impact of this highly tense and horrific slice of Jeffrey Wegand's life. It will not however show our junior high school audience good film technique.

258,bldsimple2,SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM!!!,10,6 November 1999,"I'll make this simple for you with short attention spans: Al Pacino's best performance of the 90s. Russell Crowe's best work on par with LA Confidential (if not better) and a gripping shot by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace.For those who can handle it, read on:Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) has been fired from his job. He has to break the news to his wife (Diane Venora, who I believe should go on to be one of the best actresses of all time) that their beautiful home, swank cars and health care plan (their oldest daughter is athsmatic) are about to go down the tubes. He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.Enter Lowell Bergman (Pacino), producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity, 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it. Through a friend he is put in touch with Wigand in the hopes of finding a translator. Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick, the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men. The two exchange a cat-and-mouse conversation via fax. Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day. He does.What does Wigand know? Well, its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that. But that isn't where the story ends. This is a two-fold tale; on one hand you have the self-destruction of a man who put everything on the line just so he could do the right thing. On the other, you have a television producer who so believes in the integrity of himself, the network, and his show that he is willing to risk everything he has to fight for the protection of his source. I haven't seen this much commitment outside of Woodward and Berstein's staunch protection of ""Deep Throat.""The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years, Mike Wallace. Wallace teeters on the edge of looking like a foul-mouthed, celebrity hungry, media hound who's only thought is about ratings. However, before its over, he evokes the ""integrity of Edward R. Murrow,"" a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.Director Michael Mann is known chiefly for his Action/Thrillers. This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. A lot of people have complained over the past 7-8 years about Pacino's ""staccato"" performances, suddenly shouting at the slightest provocation.

However, many people will see 7 Oscar nominations and quickly grab the movie, and will feel disappointed in the end. This movie is not for those who only enjoy fast pace action movies.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are as good as they are expected. In fact, the whole cast was good, and if you are acting lovers, watch it. You will enjoy the movie.There were some flaws in the movie too, mainly with the script. After all, it was a long movie and was slow paced. The climax seemed to start much early, but the real one was very short. When there are so many characters in a single movie, it is indeed difficult to manage them. But what does the director think? If you haven't introduced a character, and haven't even declared their names once or twice, would the viewer still get the true impression and their purpose in the storyline? Many characters were there, playing there roles in the story, who were helping the story to go forward, but their roles failed to create the instant reaction, and when they did, it seemed to be almost too late. After watching the movie, I feel like I will enjoy it more if I watch for the second time. But what about the first time? Many people will feel trouble to follow the storyline and dialogues, as they were intended to create. Many people will feel bored in the middle of the movie, trying to keep track of the twists, which are not that hard to understand, but very difficult to concentrate. No one likes to memorize every name in the movie by himself, and trying to figure out what that character is doing in the movie. I have given it 7/10, because it could be lot better than it was. Still, I will highly recommend it to everyone, mainly because of it's cast and the topic. Although I'm a smoker myself, I do feel the importance of 'Consent'.

I liked much of the acting -- with particular praise to Michael Gambon for his near perfect accent and slimy affect, and to Russell Crowe for his understated but dead on portrayal of Wigand. Some of Pacino's work did seem stacatto, blustery. Two aspects of this movie, as a film, were quite disappointing to me. It needed an editor. There were several segments that were pointlessly drawn out, the director's ""little darlings"" I think, that were not quite sleep-inducing to me, but just irritating. The movie could have been far better at 2 hours. The other problem was the music. It was, for the most part, either pointless and irrelevant, or just awful and overpoweringly distracting. The awful part consisted of a rather abstract vocal composition that should never have been 6 miles from a microphone, ever!

In fact, it is probably the best film about the news industry I have seen, but it is unfortunately very slow going at parts, especially towards the beginning.  Several scenes at the beginning of the film are completely unnecessary, and the film could have been a 10 if about 20 minutes of unneeded footage was deleted.  Despite that, though, I highly recommend it. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",The Insider

Michael Mann once again shows that he is the most magnificent, brave and intelligent movie-maker of his country. The perfomances of Russel Crowe and Christopher Plummer deserved their Oscars. The part of Wigand is the most difficult to play and detailed in recent years. The Insider is so great I really wonder if Hollywood will have some balls to spend so much money again for so little box-office reward. 10 out of 10.",The Insider
267,Canino-4,The movie that became itself,10,21 December 2000,"In writing this review, I'm tempted to address it to Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace. The Insider is a devastating film, but I think they are mistaken, if they see it as a blanket indictment of 60 Minutes. It's a blanket indictment of the tobacco industry. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of what went on at 60 Minutes, with respect to the treatment of the Jeffrey Wigand interview. This movie is a dramatic piece that takes a stab at it, and I think that heaping criticism on Director/Writer Michael Mann is a huge mistake. This film shouldn't be picked at, it should be applauded. The spirit of this film is exactly the same as that of 60 Minutes. I doubt that most people watch 60 Minutes with a notepad in their hands. I think 60 Minutes gets people to think, and hopefully look into issues that are important. I believe that was Michael Mann's goal.The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story. There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc. I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination. As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best. While this attack was taking place, across the multiplex you could go see Warren Beatty and Writer James Toback's near deification of Benjamin Siegel in Bugsy. I'm tempted to say that it's Michael Mann's dime, so he can pick whatever hero he likes. However, I think the truth is that there was a wealth of information he needed to convey, and selecting Bergman as his vehicle was the best way to go.The second issue which had supposedly ""independent"" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand. This man will probably remain an eternal enigma. Was he exaggerating his claim of being harassed for some hidden agenda? Did he lie about finding a bullet in his mailbox? Did he try to cover up that he stole an electric can-opener?This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film. Question: Isn't it more important that Wigand, a scientist who worked for Brown & Williamson, provided undisputed testimony that nicotine was being manipulated to bolster it's addictive qualities, than whether or not he stole an appliance at Walmart? Shouldn't people be more disgusted by the laughable testimony to congress by the seven heads of big tobacco (The Seven Dwarves, as he refers to them)?This movie became itself. It's a story of how many forces there are out in the world that seek to silence agitators. The simple truth is that Wigand, Wallace and Bergman had a story to tell and were crushed by some of these forces. Mann and Co-Writer Eric Roth wanted to tell this story on as big a screen as possible, and they got crushed, too. I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college. I hope this irony is not lost on Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt.It's no surprise that this film (vastly superior to the diverting, but hardly earthshaking American Beauty) was shut out at the Oscars. Kevin Spacey is one of our finest actors, but his character is not in the league of Russell Crowe's work here. Crowe's Wigand, with his birdlike and occasionally irritating behavior, with his egotism, with his intelligence, whoa! This is a performance. Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere. I guess this Crowe guy must be a schnook. Don't give him the Oscar.Truth be told, acting kudos go to all involved. Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives. Christopher Plummer's controversial characterization is a delight as well. He gets Wallace's legendary tempestuousness, his egotism and his smarts down to perfection. The small characters are drawn with a sharp eye, as well. Alert to reporters: Mann's wife Diane Venora plays Wigand's wife. Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here. Sorry.As the settlements from big tobacco come down, Mann's working on a film about about Ali, Bergman's back working in Berkeley where he belongs, Wigand is up to God knows what, and 60 Minutes chugs on, popular as ever. Memo to Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt: This was an excellent film. Admit it!!",The Insider
268,Jamal C.,One of the year's best.,9,14 November 1999,"The Insider is a terrific movie. The story is absolutely gripping and interesting. It runs a long 170 minutes, but stick through it and you'll be happy. It starts out slow and very vague, but it sets up for an explosive one hour climax that will have you on the edge of your seat.
     The performances really were this movie's strong side. Al Pacino gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. And Russell Crowe plays his part very well, giving a powerful performance, his character develops and unfolds very slowly in the story and he couldn't have done a better job on it.      The first hour or so would give you the impression of a story with a simple, easy plot. But as you think the plot is about to take a rest and the movie will simmer down, it explodes in your face, you will be surprised at the way it turns into a movie more about the corruption of our justice system and the major flaw impossible to break. Rather than JUST a conspiracy on the verge of being exposed. Al Pacino's character changes dramatically as does Russell Crowe's. And both actors do an excellent job.
     Although it is loosely based on the truth, it runs unlike other true stories. Some movies try to grab the audience and to become surprised that this could actually be true, and only that. The Insider does that, as well as producing a fine piece of dramatic cinema. Go see it while you can, you won't be disappointed.",The Insider
269,prodigaljon,See it for the performances...but bring coffee,7,10 March 2001,"There is just no way that a movie about '60 minutes' should be 3 hours long, yet Michael Mann finds a way to drag this out, much like he did in Heat. Yet despite the fact that the movie moves with the speed of a three-toed sloth on a NyQuil bender, the performances are absolutely hypnotic. Pacino, who is usually either great or cartoonish, delivers an adequate performance, but an unrecognizeable Russell Crowe is simply phenomenal.  But the most spellbinding character belongs to Christopher Plummer, who steals every scene he's in with an astounding take on Mike Wallace.  This isn't a bad movie by any means, but it's an actors movie; the performances really redeem what is otherwise an overlong exercise in directorial self-indulgence.",The Insider
270,yfm3594,masterpiece of the movie world,10,30 September 2013,"This movie is based on a true story and depicts the two men's fight against the tobacco industry in U.S. One day, Jeffrey Wigand (acted by Russell Crowe) gets fired by Brown & Williamson, a big tobacco company. He is familiar with science and health and deeply knows that tobaccos are harmful to their health. However, all tobacco companies in U.S. claim that tobaccos are NOT toxic in order to maintain commercial benefits. Furthermore Brown & Williamson threatens Wigand and his family not to tell the truth about tobaccos' harm. Wigand cooperates with a journalist, Lowell Bergman (acted by Al Pacino) and they try to disclose the secret. However, they encounter plenty of difficulties arranged by Brown & Williamson.Though you may think first 30 minutes is boring, as a whole, this is certainly interesting. In the middle of this movie, Wigand and Bergman hit so many obstacles that they seem to be up against the wall. But nevertheless, Wigand's willpower and Bergman's journalism overcome the awful situation in the end of the story. It leaves a quite agreeable aftertaste.In addition to the great plot, their acting, camera work and music are also excellent. They enable us to feel sympathetic to main character's anger, depression and bravery. I strongly recommend you to watch this great work at any rate. I'm sure this is a masterpiece of the movie world.",The Insider
271,robert-65,huh?,1,17 December 1999,"The almost universal praise this movie is getting is puzzling.  Not only is it not a great movie, it's not even a good movie.  For one thing, it's deadly dull.  Far from being the riveting thriller it's made out to be, it's an extremely slow and tedious film about a trivial subject.  It's also poorly directed.  Until I saw this movie I never understood the phrase ""over-directed,"" but now I do.  It's filled with useless and messy camera movements and weird compositions.  I don't know if Mann was trying to impress beyond his means, or simply trying to keep us awake through the boring movie, or both, but either way it doesn't work.  He just doesn't have the knack.  He had a similar problem with the disastrous Last of the Mohicans.",The Insider

The music fits marvelously. I am totally absorbed and engaged every time I watch this, to the point of tears at times. Crowe should have gotten the Oscar for this rather than for ""Gladiator,"" but alas, ""Insider"" came up against the devastating ""American Beauty"" and no one knew what to do...The film as a whole is a work of art, a true dramatic beauty, a tribute to the struggle of an ordinary, flawed man to do the right thing despite personal cost.

273,zulu934,Winner - Most Overated film of the year,4,31 March 2000,"I was really disappointed by this film.  It features lots of one dimensional characters, another tired variation on the standard hollywood corporate/government paranoid conspiracy plot, and a highly over rated performance from Russell Crowe as ""The Insider"".  What really bothered me the most though was the performance of Al Pacino. This is a guy who gave what I consider to be the two of the best performances of any actor in my lifetime. I am talking about the Godfather I&2.  His other early performances in Serpico,  Scarface, etc.. though not up to the Godfather standard, rank right up there.  Several times during the Insider I kept thinking to myself, is this the same guy??? I had the same thoughts while viewing his other recent film in which he played a football coach.  That film was so bad, I can't even remember the title. One part I will remember most about this film is the portrayal of Mike Wallace.  It was a hoot! If you have not seen the film, Christopher Plummer acts as if he is playing Mike Wallace on Saturday Night Live.  It is a totallytongue in cheek funny send up (I really don't think Mike could be that much of a buffoon in real life).  I could see why Mike was so mad about the characterization.  Hats off to Christopher Plummer for providing some comic relief to an otherwise boring film.",The Insider

The characters are interesting and well portrayed. The climactic stroy build-up makes it a satisfying viewing experience. Enhancing this entertainment value is the substance of the movie consisting of the fact that it's based on reality and the fact that it makes you think about the capitalistic society and your life in it. The enhancement is mutual because the involvement caused by the high entertainment value of the movie lets you be maximally immersed in the awareness of the power of money : choices in your life, neglect of public welfare, objectivity of journalists etc. Personally I suspect anyone disliking this movie through this medium of being connected with the tobacco industry. But then I just saw the movie :-)",The Insider

The film feels flabby and would have benefited by losing at least half an hour. Russell Crowe however is outstanding as Dr. Wigand. Although playing a man about 20 years older than his real age you would never guess from his performance.

Why must Hollywood voluntarily afflict itself with such idiotic casting decisions? America has more aspiring actors than most other nations have citizens, yet she continues to utilize foreign actors in roles wholly unsuited to their abilities. It is the modern equivalent of Black Face. To see the rare dynamism displayed here by Pacino being absorbed by the sodden lump of old lard that is Crowe's embarrassing performance is nothing short of tragic. My Latvian third cousin could have nailed the accent better than Crowe has. This movie is good - even great - but it's not a classic, and the fault is entirely Russell Crowe's, and somebody's brain-dead idea of a novel marketing gimmick.",The Insider

""The Insider"" further confirms that theory. You have to see it! I am not sure who should take most of the credit in a situation when everything falls into place so perfectly: the producer? the director? the Director of Photography, Dante Spinotti? ..... in the end, everyone of them can say, hand on heart, ""I delivered something truly great"".I wish i could honestly say i have the courage that the lead (in real life), Jeffery Wigand has. I read later in Time Magazine that he said: ""I make a difference. I feel good at the end of the day."" I am glad that's how he feels despite the stress on the family that he experienced. To move from a $300k job to a $30k job is huge, but if takes you on the road to genuine peace, its worth it. Russell Crowe, who plays Wigand brilliantly permits the viewer to empathize with somebody moving from relative normality to being on the wrong side of a major corp.'s lawyers - and all the pressures that entails.As for the second of the two lead characters, Lowell Bergman, this guy, in real life, is the embodiment of traditional journalistic integrity, tenaciousness....., and as such, I can't imagine anybody doing a better job of portraying that role than Al Pacino.

We are kept interested the entire way - this is a story about the ultimate human sacrifice - do you fight for what you believe in even if it means you could lose your job, your house, your family, and possibly even your life?

The emotional intensity of the film makes you actually wonder what is going to happen next.Michael Mann is one of the few directors who knows what to do in a movie, and he clearly shows it in this movie.

298,TenLineReview,"10 lines about ""The Insider""",9,19 January 2008,"Like it, love it or hate it, this is what Michael Mann does best.Yes, there is mostly talking and not much action, but somehow the director can even make a gag order suspenseful.The performances are rock solid, and even Gina Gershon isn't completely terrible.Russell Crowe successfully created a believable character that made the suspense work.Al Pacino, (who I sometime find to be a parody of himself), gives his most dynamic performance in years.Mann created a film where every relationship and character has ample room to breathe, providing a complex and ultimately engrossing piece of work.It doesn't get 10 stars because the score was so awful.Spinotti's cinematography and lighting design shows why he is one of the best in his field.As with other Mann films, the moods are set with lighting and set design to perfectly enhance the scene.There was so much detail and care in the craftsmanship of this film that makes it stand out amongst the standard Hollywood fodder. No wonder it sank at the Box Office.",The Insider
299,harpoonz37,The real tragedy...,9,28 April 2003,"The real tragedy is that this movie changes nothing.  This is a monumental film about a subject that affects our daily life...but is it really going to make a difference?  Not a chance.  The tobacco companies sit back and laugh. The much-delayed revelation that cigarettes are bad for you has turned into a huge boon for manufacturers.  They have built whole advertising campaigns, aimed solely at the teenage market, built around the fact that cigarettes are 'bad', and therefore teenagers want it.  Then they simply reinforce the fact that cigarettes are addictive, and virtually impossible to quit.  With that message in your head, the impression that you are going to fail before you even start, it is small wonder that only a small percentage of those who 'quit' can stay away from these things.The government, of course, plays along, even taking handouts in the form of 'lawsuits' which they make token efforts to dispute, then settle out of court for assurances of protection from further lawsuits..a.k.a. bribe money.  The only truly responsible thing to do is ban cigarettes altogether, but you and I both know that will not happen.  Why?  Because cigarette sales contribute millions to our economy, and, more importantly, billions to all of the major political parties.  So the government makes sure everyone knows cigarettes are 'bad', and noone does anything about it.And THAT is the real tragedy.",The Insider

Pacino and Aussie Crowe are both on top of their form as are all the supporting actors and actresses.The story is well paced and deep and you end up really feeling for the central character who is putting everything on the line for the public benefit ...and probably for some measure of getting even after getting canned by his former employer - the Brown & Williamson tobacco company.For those weaned on non stop action flicks with explosions, fights and gun play in virtually every scene, this is not the movie for you. For you cerebral types who enjoy a twisted, deep story with multiple layers, this is one to get your teeth into. Another review compared it to ""All the Presidents Men"" and I couldn't agree more.I didn't give it a 10 only because it was a dark story about a truly despondent man who loses everything when he chooses to do the right thing. In that regard it depresses many folks. But, hey, this was a true story that portrays the vaunted CBS 60 Minutes in a very bad light as a gutless TV show managed by gutless producers afraid of being sued for telling the truth.

There's a great cameo by Gina Gershon looking horny as ever, and lots of fab southern accents.But the whole thing is classic 'the same guy who did Miami Vice'.  It's like he's conscious of it being a bit of a dull story, so he decides to just make it really watchable and an incredible audio-visual experience. There's a bit near the start where they are having a conversation by sending each other faxes that is soooooo M Mann! And the scene where Crowe arrives at the court to give his testimony (which is your bog standard Lot's Of Journalists Standing Outside and People Saying 'No Comment') is simply magical.At 157mins, it's a bit short though (seriously!); it's even a bit rushed at the start, although he manages to dwell wonderfully on the stuff near the end.",The Insider
307,moviebuf-31,"Gritty, intense and full of nervous tension and suspense.",9,24 November 2000,"""The Insider"" is an intense, almost painful, movie to watch, due to the angst, fear and personal turmoil imparted by actor Russell Crowe.  Crowe is a master of his craft, and succeeds in making us feel at least a little of the agony Jeffrey Wigand must have felt during his whistleblower ordeal, although I am sure there are few who could truly understand what he went through. If you can stand movies that are thought-provoking, tension-building, and mysterious rather than action oriented, this movie is worth watching. Al Pacino is better in this film than he has been in a long time.  This is the true Pacino, for admirers of his work.  He does not overplay this role, yet succeeds in letting us see passion and loyalty. Even though this movie is not billed as a thriller, it has the same intensity and nervous tension, and keeps you on the edge, as if you are constantly waiting for the bogeyman to jump out of the screen and grab you.

True, the performances are first rate - as one would expect from people like Pacino, Crowe en Plummer (though Crowe deserved special mention.)True, the movie is longish (but feels fast paced nevertheless.)What has not come out in many reviews is that Mann really succeeds in submerging the audience in the sinister force field that is out to destroy the Wigand character. Mann really pulls it off to make the spectator feel part of the drama - as a spectator, but one residing within the movie as it were. The brilliantly creative camera work and editing are reinforced by a restrained but effective soundtrack. As in Heat, Mann shows once again that he is close to being a cinematographic Mozart.",The Insider

The entire time I was watching the movie I was wondering if and how many law suits will be filed over it. Certainly Mike Wallace was not presented in the best of lights.  And the blankety-blanks at Brown & Williamson must be awfully upset over their portrayal!  Even CBS was ""defamed.""  The message is great, the nobility of man is presented well, but the movie is an overload of non-essential events which detract from the message.  There were places where I actually felt bored.

One a Newsman, Pachino. The other a scientist, Crowe.If the satirical lunacy of ""Thank You For Smoking"" could be akin to the easy goings of Gerber Baby sauce, then this indigestion in the form of a laxative.Mann's uncanny and infamous eye for precision and uncompromising realism is a marvel of stylish substance in itself. Almost like it's own thematic element regardless of what it's attempting to illustrate or accompany as a motif.Unfortunately, I had been preprogrammed by his former films; ""Heat,""0 ""Collateral"" and the often overlooked, ""Miami Vice,"" to expect some sort of climactic hell-storm of machine gunfire. At first, I was actually--prematurely, at that--deeming this destined to be a stop-gap film in Mann's career. By mid-way, the sentiment of how wrong I had been was becoming more than embarrassingly palpable with each furthered development in the plot. The film could have ended several times. It could have inferred several completely differing resolutions. It proceeds despite itself to formulate it's plot out of significant character's arcs and roles, rather than playing to simply Crowe's predicament. Mann's narrative and subject matter is so layered and sparse with an unrecognizable plot at first glance, it could have properly faired well as a mini-series, similar to that of ""State of Play.""",The Insider

Especially after brilliant performances by two of the best actors Hollywood has ever produced, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Even the support actors have done a brilliant job. Russell Crowe & Al Pacino both deserved Oscars for their role. Denying them the Oscars can be considered nothing short of a sin. Exceptionally well written by Eric Roth & Marie Brenner, the dialogues in this movie take your breath away. Some scenes in this movie just blow your mind out, especially the ones where you see Ron Motley portrayed by Bruce McGill, puts down the opposing lawyer with his outburst. And also one scene where Al Pacino goes out all wild for the network not letting him run his cut. And the most brilliant part of it is, its based on a real story with some drama thrown in, which is rightly acknowledged by the director during the end credits. A fast paced movie, that doesn't let you down, I would proudly recommend this to anyone.

It is a crime this movie was not recognized. Among the excellent dialog, acting and music, is the cinematography, a wonder to behold. The limited depth of field, blurring and floating camera add to the chaos, the fear and the characters' emotion in such a way that has not been seen for decades.

I thought ""Heat"" was a long, boring waste of my time and I never liked ""Miami Vice"". That is why it is with great surprise that I announce that ""The Insider"" is the best film of 1999.  I won't get too much into it, but this film tells a riveting story with great acting.  It is well written and beautifully filmed.  The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is outstanding.  he worked on ""L.A. Confidential"" which had a great look as well.  If we think of cinematography as the use of light in film (which is what it is), then this film gets it just right.  The scene that really stuck with me was when Pacino is sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for Russell Crowe.  The shadows in that lobby just lend a whole mysterious tone to their meeting and the way Pacino's whole face is in the dark except for his searching eyes is wonderful. This film is what a best picture should be: great story, great acting, great technical work.  Like ""Titanic"" except that didn't have a great story or great acting.  It also has a great group of smaller role actors which lend it a richness so many other films lose because they focus too much on the stars.  Phillip Baker Hall, Christopher Plummer and Bruce McGill (forever D-Day in ""Animal House"") are just a few of the names that add to the greatness of this film.

He wasn't quite convincing about having a southern accent, a glitch that was slightly distracting to the otherwise intense scenes he appeared in.Otherwise every part in this movie was played to perfection, especially by Crowe and Pacino.  A very believable effort by Christopher Plummer as the venerable Mike Wallace, and all the other supporting roles tell a story of truth, morality, and justice in a way that surpasses the run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick.A great movie, one of the best, that would be great even if there were no truth to it.",The Insider
327,teaguetod,Re-watching 'The Insider',8,22 March 2014,"I distinctly remember seeing 'The Insider' for the first time in an old traditional theater on the main city square of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, sometime in early 2000. I'm sure I went back to see it a second time while it was still showing there.I know I must have seen it several times more since then, because I can remember almost every important line from the movie. But re-watching it now, it still amazes me with its freshness, intensity, and artistry. The camera work and shots are surprising, and really caught my attention this time: the extreme closeups, the contrasts between light and shadow, as well as between the extreme focus and blurry parts of the shots.'The Insider' was a commercial failure. A flop. It lost at least $30 million for Touchstone Pictures and Disney (the film's distributor and the bigger studio behind Buena Vista Pictures). The film also didn't win any Oscars (it was nominated for 7) but was beat out in every category that year by 'American Beauty' -- by comparison, an inferior, over-hyped picture. And so 'The Insider' -- a movie with a serious grown-up story about a real-life issue with the most serious implications; a story touching on health, business and the news media; a complex film for thinking adults – couldn't attract audiences to the theater, without any shootouts, car chases, or explosions.It also happens to be Michael Mann's best film, for all the reasons just mentioned. Everyone involved rises to the occasion and is great in this: Bruce McGill, Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Mister Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Colm Feore. And the major players have some of the best roles of their careers, playing real-life figures. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace: smug, vain, and yet crotchety. Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand: an anal, worried, stand-offish but tormented witness, trapped somewhere between his conscience and his comfort; his anger and resentment and the stable family life he once had. And Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman: the driven, self-righteous crusader for the freedom of the press, who has built a career seeing himself as the insatiable hound hunting after the truth -- And damn the consequences! (Best Pacino-as-reporter line: ""Everything interests me."")Watching it now, supposedly from the moral-high-horse perspective of a smug ex-smoker, is also new for me. I started smoking -- like most young idiots -- to look cool. Which was something I learned at least partially from images of smoking I saw in the movies. The media image of smoking on screen seemed to communicate something adult, sophisticated, mysterious, cool – all the things that I wanted to be.... I was a heavy smoker over a period of about 18 years (on and off, quitting for at least 2 of those years). I smoked hundreds of packs, thousands of cigarettes in that time: Marlboro Reds, Gitanes Blondes, Gauloises Bleus, Marlboro 'Lights.' I only quit (this time, hopefully the last time) about a year ago. I am almost 43 years old. Statistically, this means I will probably die of some later medical problem related to those years I spent smoking. Fully 1/2 of smokers now living and smoking will die from smoking-related illnesses. Fifty per cent. Take a coin out of your pocket and flip it. Call it: heads you live, tails you die.I was smoking away years of my life, deliberately ignoring reality. I think about these things, too, as I re-watch this film.It's only right that Hollywood tries to even the score a little in this case. It would take another six years before the comedy 'Thank You for Smoking' appeared, in 2005. Two films: that's it. Two movies in the entire one-hundred-year history of cinema. Only two films to question the deadliest drug ever shown on film -- as opposed to the sanitized, idealized, romanticized version shown in thousands of films, over more than a hundred years. Another thing to think about as you watch 'The Insider.'",The Insider

Ok, The Insider might not be the same type of film, but Mann has put his ""Mann-touch"" in it, and it got this ""darkness""/camera work/locations as seen in Heat all over it.

Michael Mann, known for classics such as ""Heat"" and ""The Last of the Mohicans"", has collected immense amount of testimonies, news reports and transcripts of ""60 Minutes"" regarding the case, and with some help from Eric Roth of Forest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fame wrote a screenplay for ""The Insider."" With its length that stretches far beyond two hours and everything said so far, it is true that this is not a movie for every type of audience. But, to think even for a moment that this movie is slow and boring would be an enormous mistake. Somewhat controversial and omnipresent topic about the power of corporation, business and money over information and truth is masterfully crafted into an intense flick.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are absolutely sensational in their main roles. Pacino is completely at home playing a witty, persistent and passionate journalist Lowell Bergman, while Crowe, being 33 at the time, simply dominates in his Oscar nominated role of Jeffrey Wigand, an erratic chemist in his early 50's whose life is getting more and more out of hand during the whole movie. With great support from, we can say, an ensemble cast of supporting actors of whom even the ones who are least known to wider audiences are doing an excellent job, and with the two Academy Awards winners we mentioned above, the movie nails its main goal and represents the two main themes extremely well.On the one hand, we have a great representation of often disregarded importance of investigative journalism in a world of capitalism. Numerous and serious obstacles faced even by an adept journalist of great reputation when dealing with a delicate story are masterfully presented as well. On the other hand, we have a thorough, realistic and detailed story of a scientist who has to abandon his ideals of improving the environment, and life of a man in general, in order to provide for his family. The magic of the whole thing is the fact that the movie does an outstanding job of showing the audience why, after a hard an unfair defeat while trying to get the truth out in the open, in the moments of despair, we don't have the right to stop, and we mustn't give up.All of this is crowned with Michael Mann's directing. He has an incredible eye for detail and the ability to hold a viewer's attention even in those seemingly slow and boring parts of the movie by making a hypnotizing atmosphere just by accenting some sound effect, like rustling of leafs on a light wind, for example.91/100",The Insider

331,epolito,The insider,10,15 March 2005,"this has got to be one my very favourite movies: superbly written a and screen played, cleverly directed, brilliantly acted... it proves that a story focused on a normal bloke u can meet in your everyday's life can be just as interesting as the most surreal and extravagant Hollywood plot. Acting plays a big part in this movie obviously as both Pacino and Crowe give a lesson of drama school and literally carry the story forward almost on their own. Cinematography is key, every little detail taken care of, we all know Michael Mann's style from Heat but he really nails it with this picture. Master in adding drama and taking you to the edge of your seat when you don't actually see a single weapon (or not in use anyway), or explosions or deaths or anything like that in the entire reel, this is all accomplished throughout vision and prevision in all aspects of film directing.

Its always interesting to ask a director what scenes he liked but had to cut out of the movie.  There was no sweeping needed on this cutting room floor.I must say that Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did excellent jobs.  I think that they will both be nominated for awards this year.The camera movement and quick zooms got to be annoying and distracting at times.  This is common in Mann's films I am told.  I just found it irritating.",The Insider

Al Pacino's performance was as passionate as I've seen him give, as deep into his character as his roles in ""Scarface"" and ""Glen Gary, Glen Ross"".. Russell Crowe is a force up and coming, and Michael Mann's direction is once again spectacular. With a sound-track as eerie and deep as ""Dead Man Walking"" this film is a must see...

In two of his previous films, ""Thief"" and ""Heat"", Mann took great care to place his [male] characters in front of deeply calm, deeply blue-green watery horizons at moments of inner turmoil. As the seas calmed them, thus they were renewed for the rest of the picture. James (Thief) Caan goes to the waterfront with his bag of breakfast, breathes deeply. Robert (Heat) DeNiro lives in an architect's dream house of steel and glass with a perpetual thin line of blue sea/sky bisecting the view from his living room.In ""The Insider"", which I must admit is a brave, well-made picture, Mann once again places and lights his actors against an aquatic mise-en-scene so precise as to be painterly.Russell Crowe, in the film's biggest will-he-or-won't-he dramatic moment, faces out onto Pascagoula's Gulf of Mexico. Crowe's body is arranged just so in the frame, the waterline there, the trunk of the palm tree there, a distant sailboat there, none of this an accident. The photographic work is, again, simply stunning. Later, Pacino stomps about in an eerie green foaming Caribbean inlet, the color, and the waves, a sign as to his inner struggles with his own moral weight and the pressures of modern telejournalism.The supporting cast -- especially Bruce McGill -- and the ambient score are both a strong plus.""10"" from me.

He has improved with each.  ""Heat"" was also an excellent film, but Mann improves on the grade A quality of even ""Heat.""  I was blown away by ""The Insider.""  I decided I had to see it when I realized it was another Michael Mann epic, and especially at the presence of Al Pacino.  Now, while Pacino gives yet another chill-worthy performance, Russel Crowe is the real gem in this film.  I am not sure that I have seen such a layered portrayal of a human's absolute despair since Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver.""  The acting alone makes this film worthwhile as does the pathos of Crowe's character.  Now add the brilliant rapid-fire dialogue and you already have a masterpiece.  This does not even include the cinematography:  which ranks right up there ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""2001..."" for some of the best of all-time.  I have read statements that the film takes itself too seriously and borders on self-righteousness.  Not so. This is a crucial morality tale that explores the importance of not selling-out and doing ""the right thing.""  These characters are far from self-righteous.  They are not even sure they believe in their cause. Please see this film.  This is an example of why movies are made.  By the way, don't avoid the film simply because you smoke; the scope is much larger than just tobacco.",The Insider

IThe two movies which I had been eager to see were American Beauty and The Insider. After sitting through the unmerciful mess that was American Beauty, I wandered half dazed into the theatre across the ahll, thinking ""this movie cannot be any better"". How wrong I was. I was jolted from my seat for the whole 3 hours, mesmerised and dazzled by the best picture of the year. The dialogue crackled, the scenes wrenched my heart to the core and chemistry between Pacino, Plummer and Crowe delighted me to the very end. What could have been a very simple and mundane tale about a ""whistle-blower"", turned out to be the best 3 hours I have ever spent in a theatre. If I had a say in the best movie of the year it would not be American Beauty, not by a long shot. It would be The Insider.",The Insider
339,Smurfo,A superior thinking-person's drama,9,21 May 2000,"A previous review on this site made a succinct, apt comment about this film: ""This movie is for people who like to think...."" I cannot sum up my impressions of this film better than that. ""The Insider"" treats the audience as if it is intelligent, never force-feeding us data. Those of you who prefer to turn off your brain when watching movies, do yourself a favor - rent this movie and realize what you have been missing all this time.Russell Crowe (excellent as Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential"") plays Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive ousted from his job because he won't play ball. Without saying too much, he has an insider's story to tell - about how the tobacco companies manipulate nicotine to make it more addictive and how he knows the ""Seven Dwarves"" (Wigand's term for the executives of the main seven tobacco companies) lied in their testimony to Congress.Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman, is a producer for 60 Minutes who wants his show to be the public conduit for Wigand's information. The film chronicles how difficult it is to publicize this damaging information not just because of retaliation by the the tobacco companies but by CBS's unwillingness to stick it's neck out on a vital public health issue.Crowe is marvelous - he effectively conveys the emotions of a tormented man, yet he never becomes a characture. Wigand is intelligent and wants to protect his family, and that never changes despite the odds. Al Pacino is excellent as usual - he convincingly portrays Bergman's dogmatic pursuit of truth and his high standard of never leaving a source hanging out to dry. The suspension of disbelief took over quickly for me. Early on, I stopped looking at Pacino and Crowe as Pacino and Crowe - they were Bergman and Wigand to me.This film affected me much in the same way ""Quiz Show"" did. Both films are in ways about ""the end of innocence"" by selling out principles to the almighty dollar. One convicting scene involves Bergman battling CBS legal department over the story. The gist of the lawyer's position is simply this: the more truth you tell, the more liable CBS is. If that's not twisted, I don't know what is.This movie should get you thinking about a variety of issues: what is a corporation's responsibility to the public well-being? Does corporate ownership of the media compromise what is reported? Is it worth all the personal sacrifices to make certain information public? If you're not thinking about larger issues after watching this film, you simply weren't paying attention.My rating: 9 out of a possible 10",The Insider

Everyone is singing praises for Russell Crowe, and with good reason. The ones that really blew me away, though, were Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer. Director Michael Mann also snuck some clever camera work and beautiful photography in. The only problem I had with the film was that some of the camera work was unprofessionally shaky.

341,Mistress of the Dim,Excellent cinematography and music elevate a tedious story,8,8 November 1999,"In order to do justice to an actual event either in a book or in a film, it usually helps to allow adequate time to pass between the event itself and the retelling of the event.  This allows authors, filmmakers, etc. time to assess the social, political, and/or historical significance of the incident and tell the story with this in mind.  Unfortunately, the controversy in Mann's -The Insider- occurred only four years ago and the true, perhaps indelible impact Wigand's story had on the tobacco industry, on investigative journalism, and on America as a whole has yet to be felt.Mann's movie certainly details a provocative--sometimes infuriating--incident, however the film entertains without providing much analysis or insight about WHY Wigand's saga is important.

I love how Mann plays out the scenes to give you the feeling he's looking for. It's Pacino's best performance since Scent of a Woman, and Russell Crowe is terrific. Christopher Plummer (from 'A Beautiful Mind') was the perfect man to play Mike Wallace. This is a story about truth, integrity, and the politics of the business world. The ending almost makes you cry. It's a fight for truth. A masterfully told story, excellent camera work, one of the best scripts in a long time, and Lisa Gerrard's score is perfect (remember her from 'Gladiator'?).

Tobacco companies added a chemical extracted from plants to give their product a more pleasant smell. They added green-leaf-volatiles; the chemical that gives fresh cut grass its pleasant smell. Jeffrey Wigand called it ""rat poison."" Warfarin is a rat poison in huge quantities and can be made from green leaf volatiles, it is also a life-saving drug that prevents strokes and heart-attacks. So the ""whistle-blower"" lied to make himself appear to be a hero.

In this movie, Michael Mann show's us how great a director he is. And the screenplay is just great in my opinion. I do have to say one thing though, I have read other comments about this movie, and Pacino barely receives recognition for his performance. The focus is mostly on Russel Crowe. Now don't get me wrong, Crowe did do a fine job portraying Dr. Jeffery Wigand, but Pacino was amazing as Lowell Bergman, the producer of CBS's 60 minuets. Now, this movie is based on a true story, and Pacino and Crowe delivered grand performances as these real life men.

In ""The Insider"" he constantly uses awkward focusing techniques and hand-held cameras- it's like watching ""The Blair Witch Project"" but worse because you're trying to follow a complex plot, but people's heads keep shifting in and out of focus, and the camera keeps zooming around in blurry close-ups, that I got dizzy every scene.  The movie was too long at almost 3 hours, it could have easily had 30 minutes or so cut. The problem is I really liked this movie.  I was looking forward to it, Mann's awkward direction and often out-of-place music cues detracted a lot from this film- I can only honestly give it ** out of **** stars.

354,Topdog-182,"Very good drama, fine performances",7,10 November 1999,"I thought the movie made very good drama out of a story that might of otherwise been rather dull (I am not a follower of the smoking industry scandal). Fine performances all around, but particularly by Russell Crowe. I would only dispute some of the directional choices with respect to what I would say was dramatic effect over charaterization.For example, the extreme closeups and the soundtrack (much as I enjoy that kind of music) often made me wonder when someone was about to get shot; impending danger, yes, impending extreme violence, a slight overstatement, no? Additionally, I think a few corners had been cut in the characterizations of some of the important supporting roles such as Liane Wigand, and Mike Wallace. I felt the former's exit from the marriage seemed premature relative to immediate context of the narrative; similarly, Wallace's decision to side with CBS Corporate seemed to come out of left field. I believe in both cases the story could have foreshadowed a little better the capacity for the characters to eventually make the decisions that they did (the restaurant meeting scene wasn't enough to me). Instead, we saw extensive footage given to the opening Iranian sequences, the Unibomber sequences, though plotwise their relation to rest of the story was rather inconsequential.Moreover, I felt that the film towards the end dropped the development of who I thought was the protagonist, Wigand, to concentrate solely on Lowell Bergman's heroism. I think I would have like to see more of Wigand as 'survivor'.These points downgraded the film's quality for me, though on the whole, very good!",The Insider

To give an example, the scene at the driving range is one of the longest and most unneeded scenes in film history. The entire scene could have been cut in half, at least. As a movie fan, I am all into long shots, but this was ridiculous!!! The story was indeed intriguing, but the way it was presented was nothing that needed to take 2 and a half hours of my time.

358,andycrane1,"The most engrossing, clever film of 1999",10,9 May 2001,"The Insider is based on the true story of two men who fight to get public information out to the public. Lowell Bergman (Pacino) is a producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Wigand (Crowe) is an ex-executive at Brown and Williamson (America's 3rd largest tobacco company). When Bergman approaches Wigand to be a consultant on a fire safety study on cigarrettes Brown and Williamson blackmail him into furthering his confidentiality agreement. Bergman can tell that Wigand has something to say but can't. So he sets up Wigand to testify in a court of public opinion on behalf of the state of Mississipi. He does, and he also does a CBS interview on 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace (Plummer). The information is simple. That the tobacco industry has been lying to the people about nicotine. That it is not only addictive but they also manipulate it to increase its addictiveness. But big tobacco are trying to do all they can to shut Wigand up. They use restraining orders, they treating CBS with a lawsuit and they start a smear campaign against Wigand. All these things separate Wigand from his family and Bergman from the rest of CBS. This was a fantastic movie. It deserved all 7 of the Oscars it was nominated for. Michael Mann's direction is impeccable as he shows what the people are thinking and the emotions they are feeling. The film is long but very engrossing. The film switches half-way through from Wigand giving the information to Bergman fighting to air the information. Al Pacino shows that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood with an Oscar worthy performance. But the star of the show was Russell Crowe as Jeff Wigand. His performance is perfect as a man torn between what is right and what is best for his family and he stops short of showing Wigand to be a persecuted hero, but as a man whose whole life is threatened by what he knows.

367,Peter-68,A Powerful and Under-rated Story,10,19 April 2000,"I can understand why the validity of the truth behind this film might be questioned.  However, you have to realize that you have to see this movie for what it is:  A powerful story about strength, hope and how an individual can overcome REALISTIC, overwhelming odds.  Ironically enough, another film like this one was also overlooked by the academy, whose characters used hope and strength to survive more life-threatening situations: ""The Shawshank Redemption"".From the movie's excellent direction (a superior ability to make a thriller without action and still maintain the quick pace), wonderful screenplay,haunting musical score and especially the fantastic acting) will be a film to be remembered for a long time.The acting is incredible.  Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace is frightenly real.  Pacino finally gave up his screaming method-acting he picked up in ""Scent of a Woman"" and gave a subtle, energetic portrayal that is his best in years.But the actor who gives the movie its heart is Crowe's Wigand.  His is a performance that shows realistic struggles of what this man is going through and what he loses.  And when he does get his emotional battle scars, he maintains his silent composure, but reveals his pain through his eyes. His is the best portrayal of ""an ordinary man facing an overwhelming circumstance"" and should be an example of how to face our problems like a fighter, not a victim.I was extremely disappointed that he did not win for best actor.  Although I am a Kevin Spacey fan,  Crowe's was the most multi-layered, and the transformation was more thorough.  Unfortunately,  for the last 3 years, the academy has been blatantly showing that it's not the best performance that wins, but who is the most popular.  3 years ago, it was Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt who won for ""As Good As it Gets"", instead of Judi Dench for ""Mrs. Brown"" and Peter Fonda for ""Ulee's Gold"" (or Robert Duvall for ""Apostle"").  Then, 2 years ago: Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Roberto Benigni for ""Life is Beautiful"" instead of Cate Blanchette for ""Elizabeth"" and Nick Nolte for ""Affliction"" or Ian McKellan for ""Gods and Monsters"".  Now, Kevin Spacey came out of the blue for ""American Beauty"", based on this popularity.  The only redeeming factor was Swank winning for ""Boys Don't Cry"".Again, I'm a fan of Spacey's, but Crowe, as well as many others in this film, were robbed of the recognition they deserved. Perhaps the inspiration that is generated from the film to the viewer is good enough.",The Insider

There is little action, but the film is steeped in an atmosphere of tension and high drama. The direction by Michael Mann is masterful, an object lesson in how to frame shots and let silence, as well as words - and music - work for the story. Al Pacino is once more the great actor of early films such as 'Scarecrow', instead of the theatrical performer of recent films.  Russell Crowe shows his solid 'ordinary guy'character as more tortured through losing his family than any of the macho scenes he portrayed in 'Gladiator.'  A superb film.",The Insider

Oh.. the movie was only 2 hours and 50 minutes.. well it fooled me. Anyway, if you're absolutely dying to see this movie, go see it, then kill yourself. It really is that bad. The only reason I saw it is because I was ""guilt tripped"" into it by a kid I know that just wanted to keep a girl ""happy."" Nuff said. After seeing that, I'm ready to see ""The House on Haunted Hill"" about 40 more times to make up for the 2 and a half hours that wasted my life.

Having said that let me also say that the movie was long and it's span was felt by the crowd.There were many scenes that could have been easily avoided and edited out of the final version. The movie is also extremely ""quiet"". There are many moments where people stare at each other for an average of one and a half minute without really ""connecting"" with the crowd.Again the acting by EVERYONE was superb. And Michael Mann's touch was evident throughout the movie. When the ""Insider"" was standing at the beach pondering the result of his actions it was pretty much a modern version of Sonny Crockett at the Miami beach before he had to arrest his girlfriend.I think that the movie-goers that are going for action will be disapointed.

And a lot of people were left feeling let down by ""Heat"" (including myself),  but this film the ""Insider"" draws you in like some type of cinematic whirlpool.  I will not spoil the movie but merely state how this film affected me.Russell Crowe gives a great layered performance as the main character.  In the way he conveys the pressure he is being put through by the tobacco company, 60 minutes, his family and all sorts of other influences is almost painful but stunning to watch.  At times I wanted to yell at the screen and say ""will you just leave the guy alone"". Truly a man against the world feeling.  Pacino is very understated but powerful when the script calls for it.  I thought he was very well cast as the producer for 60 minutes.Another great aspect of this film is the way it lays bear the inside workings of the television and print media.  I thought stock brokers werebrutal.  Truly interesting to watch and to witness how a news story comes together.Well all in all a great story with well acted characters through out this film.

Well, the start of the movie (let's say, the first half an hour)was quite good. And of course, Russell Crowe (who I loved in the Australian film 'Proof') and Al Pacino are good actors. But the film went on forever, everything was so elaborate it just became tedious and overdone; it just didn't manage to reach the point that the viewer became really 'captured' and involved in what was happening on-screen. The occasional witty remarks of good old Al Capone (as I like to call him as an hommage for all his gangsta' rolls) were a relief, but after some time even this became a bit of a bore. He tried too hard to be a clown, it seemed, and it didn't really fit in the basically serious story. It wasn't just as tedious as another Capone film, 'City Hall', which also dealt with corruption on high political levels, but it came quite close. 5 out of 10, I'm sorry, Mr. Mann. Incredible that the IMDB users voted an average of 8.4...But: ""de gustibus non est disputandum"".",The Insider

And yet it is utterly absorbing, gripping and powerful, a story of how two (fairly) ordinary guys face an overwhelming situation. The chemistry between Al Pachino and Russell Crowe is electrifying. Micheal Mann has directed the best movie of his career with superb camera work, soundtrack and compelling performances. Don't believe what you hear - it isn't too long, in fact it wasn't long enough.

Is it boredom, fatigue or disgust ? Anyway, it's the same mask as in Gladiator !Then there's the pace of the film - or rather it's lack. I must say I've had to watch this movie (on DVD) on several moments, pausing after each 30 mn not to fall asleep.If you want to see what kind of masterpiece action-packed movie with DEPTH Michael Mann can realize, then (re)watch Heat !I rate this film 2/5.",The Insider

He then realizes that maybe everything he is doing isn't worth all he has lost, (i.e. his family, his safety, his job).  This film was a real controversial masterpiece of modern times.

383,chris-391,"If only all films were this cinematic, this engaging.",10,30 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Having taken the crime thriller just about as far as it could go with his last film, Heat, writer/director Michael Mann has shifted his attention to staging this gripping and elaborate drama-documentary. Based on a true-life magazine article, The Insider follows the contrasting fortunes of Jeffery Wigand and Lowell Bergman, two men driven by different incentives, yet both compelled into achieving the same result: to reveal to the American public the shocking truth that will result in the biggest public reform issue the nation has ever seen. Having been unfairly fired, Wigand, a former research scientist at tobacco giants Brown & Williamson, is prepared to go on national television and reveal the facts behind the company's part in 'impact boosting', a chemical process designed to artificially increase the addictiveness of nicotine. Bergman, a producer at CBS' '60 Minutes', one of the country's most popular prime-time current affairs shows, feels it is his programme's moral duty to air what Wigand has to say, claiming it is the public's right to know. However, after agreeing to go ahead with the interview, Wigand comes up against several moral and legal dilemmas. By spilling the secrets he knows, he will be breaking a still-binding confidentiality agreement he signed with Brown & Williamson. They in turn have made it clear that by going public, Wigand will be placing the lives of his family in jeopardy, while at the same time risking a lengthy prison sentence for himself. Making constant use of stark close-ups and jittery, anxious camerawork, The Insider succeeds on several levels. As a drama, Mann's film is both engaging and compelling, with his deliberate, urgent directing invariably drawing the viewer into the heart of the scenes, almost placing them at the centre of the arguments in the boardrooms and courtrooms on screen. Mann has always been a visual stylist, but here he restrains from many of his familiar trademarks, opting instead for many long, hand-held, often amateur-looking takes. But if we look beyond any technical concerns, his chosen style of shooting only adds to the claustrophobic nature of the characters' situations, giving the entire film a documentary-like feel. He allows his camera, and therefore the viewer, to intrude upon, rather than merely record, scenes that often seemed improvised as a result. The performances from the leads only add to the impression that we are witnessing a real drama rather than a movie. As Wigand, the Oscar-nominated Russell Crowe is outstanding, giving his character a nervous vulnerability, while carefully avoiding the cliches of the helpless victim. He also manages to characterise the growing frustration and anger Wigand feels at being trapped and threatened into silence by forces more powerful than he'll ever be. The audience can only sympathise with his plight. While, as the determined and ethical Bergman, Al Pacino is his usual forthright self, wading through a legal and moral minefield to achieve what he believes is right, while berating anyone who stands in the way of him keeping his promise of giving Wigand a public platform from which he could blow his whistle. A film laden with both cinematic and dramatic substance, The Insider proves to be a very rewarding experience for those prepared to endure its two-and-a-half hours running time. Along with co-writer Eric Roth, Michael Mann has crafted a memorable, intense, and great-looking movie, one which is made all the more satisfying by his focusing upon the characters rather than the increasingly complex legal wranglings. Instead of allowing his film to drown under the weight of corporate red tape and boardroom-level corruption, he is sure never to stray too far away from the human centre of his drama, always careful to remind the audience that the characters on screen are as real and as flawed as they",The Insider

Watching this film brings a new appreciation for reports and documentaries that challenge the status quo. I was particularly reminded of the little-known but powerful documentary ""Taken for a Ride"" (1996), not only because of the similarities in broad plotlines (corporations doing whatever it takes to maintain or enhance their ""market""), but also because of the recognition given to the complex relationships between stakeholders at the corporate AND (more importantly, as the film emphasises) the individual level.

But it is the way that the tobacco corporation handles such issues that I also take note of. Russell Crowe was excellent, even in his mannerism's of acting like the Sr. Corp. VP, a powerful position. Al Pacino was excellent as the guiding force behind trying to help Jeffry Wygand get his message to the masses. Even the wife's character was played to a tee. I took it as ""They used to love each other, in some other life"", but the prestige and power involved corrupted them both to a point where they grew apart. The father truly loved his little girls, the mother was more worried about ""what the neighbors will think"" of their sudden misfortune of losing a job, and having to move to a lesser neighborhood. (family values? What family values! It's about how we look, not the love). hehe. Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie. As a compliment to this one ... the BOOK ""Runaway Jury"" would be an excellent look into Big Tobacco's theme. And way of doing business.Michael Mann is a genius. This movie has a way of drawing the viewer right into the minds of each and every main character. In particular, the scene of Jeff in the hotel room, and it panning off to the walls giving way to the picture of his 2 daughters playing, looking at him from a great distance. Despair. Anguish.

Disney had no idea how to market ""The Insider"" and essentially sold it as tobacco movie and it is so much more. Pacino gives a grand A plus performance as a Long Island Jewish producer and halfway through the movie I forgot he was Al Pacino. Even better Christopher Plummer masterfully captures the full essence of Mike Wallace. Gina Gershon could turn lust from a stone as always. Michael Mann seems to always pull strong performances from his actors, and Eric Roth who brilliantly adapted ""Forrest Gump"" did the same here with Mann.

Since the Bush-administration in the USA took over, the interests of industry and government overlap. How free can the press be when this happens? Not all journalists are as brave as Lowell Bergman. Some Americans should read about the evil propaganda methods of Goebels (remember?).

I did know, however, that this was Michael Mann's next project after ""Heat""(1995), a movie near and dear to my heart, and that was what brought me to the theater.It turns out that I was thoroughly captivated by this story from minute 1 to minute 157. Told by any other director this may have been a real bore but the combination of Michael Mann, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Dante Spinotti (camera), and the musicians make this movie incredible. Usually when I watch a movie that uses extensive cutting between two protagonists, one is more boring than the other and I can't wait to get back to the good one.  In this movie, the scenes with Russell Crowe are just as good as the ones with Pacino.I couldn't find a hole in the acting amongst anyone including Gina Gershon who I thought might screw it up.  Russell Crowe plays a perfect defensive, upper forties(he's really only 35), corporate and family man.  Al Pacino plays a perfect upper forties man (he's really 59) at the top of his profession.  I can imagine that it would've been pretty easy and tempting to vilify Mike Wallace but you won't find that here. Christopher Plummer portrays an intelligent Wallace who made me feel as if each of his decisions were rightly motivated by what he says is his main concern, getting old.""The Insider"" is shot very similarly to ""Heat"" in that there are many, many, telephoto and macro shots.  Michael Mann must have the fastest lens available to be able to shoot telephoto in the dark with decent depth of field.

This film is a riveting tale of corruption in corporate America, of valuing money and personal advantage above traditional, basic fundamental human values such as respecting human life and telling the truth. Two courageous but imperfect men, and their allies, prevail in the face of an army of greedy, dishonest, egoistic, cynical people surrounding them. As such, this film does a masterful job in telling this story, in a powerful fashion that no documentary (well, perhaps if Ken Burns produced it, and Stephen Ambrose was still around to be interviewed, not having succumbed to smoking induced lung cancer) could have conveyed.

How wrong was I.Russell Crowe and Al Pacino both give outstanding performances. Crowe is one of the most talented ""new"" actors around. See L.A. Confidential for proof.Mann's use of intense lighting, close-ups and wide landscape shots to establish atmosphere are more refined than in Heat. While most directors either ignore the environment and how it relates to the story or characters, or use it as eye candy, Mann understands the importance of atmosphere. Music, photography, lighting, all can say more in a single scene than most directors can get across in a whole movie.I have to respectfully disagree with Gooch-4 about the lack of focus of the film. The story is about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Wigand is the ordinary person thrust into the center of the maelstrom.

Russell Crowe has turned in an excellent portrayl of Jeffrey Wigand.  Christopher Plummer was so believable as Mike Wallace there were times I forgot it wasn't really him.  Al Pacino is always a joy to watch. He makes acting seem so simple and flawless.  The pace was slow but my interest was held throughout, and this type of story benefits from the slower pace.  The only discordant part for me was the music, but after a while I really didn't notice.  I recommend this movie highly for inteligent adult fare.",The Insider
402,kickaha5,A Great Film,9,12 March 2000,"Truly a great film.  The best work Michael Mann has ever done and the finest work Al Pacino has done in a long time.  Russell Crowe deserves his Best Actor nod for a restrained and understated performance.  Also impeccable casting for all of the smaller roles .The film has a consisent visual style and tells the story patiently without being indulgent.  Great editing, great sound and a compelling script based on a true story.",The Insider
403,andrew.patterson1,A very interesting and well paced drama,9,16 May 2000,"I was looking forward to this latest release by the man Michael Mann, as his past efforts include ""Heat"" & ""Last of the Mohicans"", both of which I own on DVD.The Insider just shows how a movie can be made to grip you without the need for action sequences. All actors in the film excel themselves as portraying the characters essential to the story in particular the mighty Pacino as the investigative journalist and Crowe as the insider, looking to uplift the guilt of working in America's tobacco industry.If you are looking for a movie in which you have to think with the movie as it progresses through its twists and turns, then this is one hell of a show. If however you are expecting action sequences then forget it, as the only bit of action is Crowe rolling down the lawn in front of his house!!!Essential viewing if you are a Pacino fan, and not to be missed as a film on the whole.",The Insider

One can only heave a sigh of relief that there are still some, as portrayed in this movie,  that still consider their moral integrity more important than illegal pressures from such groups. The acting was outstanding, although my family had a problem at times figuring out where we were due to the hop-scotching without warning technique used in trying to get the story out.",The Insider

406,mkp51,A real life thriller about an American hero!,9,20 September 2000,"""The Insider"" is an exceptionally well acted and well produced film.  It faithfully tells the true story of Jeffrey S. Wigand, a former top executive with Brown and Williamson tobacco company, and the man who ""blew the whistle"" on his former employer with his now famous interview with Mike Wallace on the CBS news show ""60 Minutes.""This film is interspersed with superb performances by Russell Crowe (as Wigand), Al Pacino (as CBS news producer Lowell Bergman) and Christopher Plummer (as Wallace.)  The screenplay crackles with tension in this real-life drama; the film has a dark, taut and suspenseful mood which kept me completely engrossed from start to finish, and reminded me of another true-to-life film with similar themes of ""whistleblowing"" and journalistic integrity: ""All the President's Men.""""The Insider"" is a movie I will view and savor...over and over again!!",The Insider

Acting, yea Acting! and ... storyline, yea! and ... Characters, yea, Characters!Wow, a real movie.  The worst part about variable reinforcement schedules is that the payoff takes so long, the good part is that once something good happens, it seem really good compared to all the other garbage out there.Not recommended for people who need sex and violence to feel alive and satisfied.

The reason that president's is a classic is that it is more tightly edited. Half an hour of screen time isn't needed. If i were Mann I'd re-edit, minus at least 25 minutes, release it as a director's cut (against the general trend of such things to be longer) and it would be an almost flawless piece",The Insider

The Insider is an informative true story that shows us how Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) chose to fight and reveal the lies of the tobacco company Brown & Williamson. We see how it cost him his family, his reputation, and forever changed his life. Al Pacino does an amazing job of portraying the 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman who helped Wigand along his journey of emptiness, heartache, and frustration in order to show the American people the truth. Russell Crow gives the performance of his career, and Al Pacino again shows America what real acting is all about. With the magnificent script from Eric Roth & Michael Mann and the beautiful score by Lisa Gerard & Pieter Bourke, we receive one of the most powerful and gripping movies of 1999.",The Insider

Have always missed the beginning or the end or the middle when it comes on TV. And I was engrossed and as drawn in this time round, even though I knew what was going to happen.Without giving too much about the plot, Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe), decides to blow the whistle on his employees, a big tobacco company. And he chooses to do so on America's premiere Television News show, 60 Minutes, which is produced by Lowell Bergmann.The script by Eli Roth and Michael Mann is tight and has some intelligent writing. This was possibly Mann's triumph in using hand held camera work, which has in the last few years adapted by people like Winterbottom, Greengrass and Liman.But the film's aces are the actors...and all of them. Led by the paranoid and even guilt ridden Russell Crow who must make the choice between family and his conscience. Crowe's body language, his nervous twitches steal the show the much seasoned Al Pacino, who delivers a usual strong performance. Christopher Plummer too has some great moments of acting.Overall a great film. A must watch for all, especially in today's climate, where news is not we are made to believe it is, and as Al Pacino says, 'Heros are scarce!'",The Insider

416,pablogoncalo,An encounter,9,9 August 2009,"Film review: The insider An encounter between two honest men who dedicate their lives seeking ""truth"" in their jobs - this is the plot of The Insider, a film directed by Michael Mann. In one part of this story the chief protagonist is a journalist who believes that news may change the way people perceive the world. This man is Lowell Bergman and he produces the TV show 60 minutes. The second main character is Jeffrey Wingand, a chemist who worked as executive and researcher for big corporations, including one of the biggest tobacco companies. Just after being fired from his last job, Wingand starts thinking of the crooked strategies used by the tobacco industry to addict its consumers. Wingard and Bergman are both constrained by corporate rules yet they must fight against them to maintain their own principles. Maybe they simply know too much and can't hide certain company secrets anymore. In reality, Jeffrey Wingand did indeed denounce certain claims made by the US tobacco industry. He stated that the tobacco CEO's knew exactly what substances were inside each cigarette. Wingard's testimony was the first step toward changing the relationship between the US government and the tobacco industry. It was also a big media event planned and detailed by an unknown producer of one of the biggest US TV shows. Besides this true story, The Insider focuses on the personal drama in which the characters are driven by moral conflict. Both Wingard and Bergman expose their choices in obtaining their victory. They were ordinary people under extraordinary pressure. On the other hand, they also gave up vital everyday values, such as security and stability. It is not by chance that Wingard's wife asks him for a divorce. For his part, Bergman quits after working more than a decade for 60 minutes. Their personalities and values clash with corporate regulations and their employers react in a hostile manner. Wingard and his family are pursued and investigated. Bergman is not allowed to show his program as he wished. All the professional and ethical values to which they dedicate their lives suddenly disappear. From the corporation's point of view, business and law are more important. In other words, the professional status and security they enjoy appears to be a company possession.",The Insider
417,fran10,Here you see real people struggling for what they believe is right,10,30 January 2003,"I've just  seen this movie and I found it absolutely great. Basically what I like about the movie is that you see several people who are all trying to live according to their own basic values, and those values tend to clash every now and then. It starts with the character Wigand who, having worked in the health-care industry now accepts a job with a tobacco company because of the high salary they pay. He then finds out that no matter the salary, he can not live with the consequences of his work. Upon protesting to the nature of his work, he is fired. At one point, his wife leaves him, with the motivation: ""I really want to support you, but I can not take this kind of life"" In other words, she wants to support her husband, but finds that she is not able to muster the strength needed to full fill her wish. When Al Pacino hears that his interview is not to be broadcasted because of the risk to CBS, one of his colleagues who has a financial stake in CBS says ""Are you accusing me of being influenced by the money"". Where upon Pacino answers with sarcasm ""No I'm not accusing you, you are a volunteer, you work for free just like me. Of course you are influenced by the money!"" Time and time again you see these scenes where you can understand the motivation of all the characters involved and you can also understand that every one of them is trying to do the good thing, even though they vehemently disagree about what ""the good thing"" would be. Whereas I can understand that this movie leaves you in a depressed state of mind because it shows you how very far the power of large cooperations actually goes, it can also give you a boost. Most people here act out of their will to do good. At the end, the movie increased my faith in humanity.",The Insider
418,asdsasde,Exceptional,10,23 December 2011,"This movie is genuine art - unlike 99% of what is out there. This is the best movie I have seen. Casting excellent. Script excellent. Cinematography excellent. Soundtrack excellent. Every one of the characters is robust and phenomenal. The main characters in most movies are not as developed as background characters are in this film. It took me a while to even believe that Russell Crowe was the same person as the lead in Gladiator. While I feel that Pacino plays more or less the same way no matter his character, he really suits this movie. Even supporting characters have memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie, my favorite being the courtroom deposition of Wiegand (Crowe). This movie provides intensity on so many levels. There is action (not shootouts or car chases...), suspense, heroism, depression, hope - you name it. There is abundant complexity in the plot, especially in regard to Wiegand being pushed to the edge of sanity. Lisa Gerrard (vocals) is perfect as usual for adding drama and feeling. The camera work in my opinion - while a different beast - is on par with Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, and other famed movies. If you prefer movies that don't follow the conventional, cliché plot, this is one you must see.",The Insider
419,exsmall-1,best movie I've seen in a while,10,13 July 2004,"I am an avid movie viewer, and this is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. What's surprising is that I am not even a huge fan of the director, or Crowe...and Pacino is playing a character he's played in previous films, so his good acting did not influence my opinion. I just think the general acting from all involved is superb(notably the 1 court room scene), there is a lot of tension throughout the movie, and the story is very interesting and poignant. Comparing this to other similar movies: JFK by oliver stone lacks the tension that the insider has. Heat by mann, while enjoyable, is not as tight. OK That is all.",The Insider

The Insight Team's exposure of the KGB's poison pellet 'umbrella' killer's methods from being revealed, and the inside story of the uses of the UK's SAS London Iranian Embassy siege were some of those I personally experienced.Jeffrey Wigland deserves to be canonized for his bravery and service to mankind. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe portray exactly the experiences some of us (investigative) journalists (all journalism is investigative, surely) go through. Exhilarating in helping right a wrong, and ensuring people know the truth.Once people know the truth (the whole truth) they are able to make proper and responsible decisions.

421,sdg1980,A must-see for many reasons,10,22 May 2008,"Before coming to ""The Insider,"" I had no idea of Michael Mann. After watching it, I have been literally hunting for his movies around and watching them one by one. This is by far one of the BEST movies Hollywood can or will ever produce. The subject is delicate and extremely well handled; movies on whistle blowers are not uncommon, but showing the corporate corruption and the cover-ups that upper echelons of the society engage in needs some mastery over detail and know-how. The real insider for me is Michael Mann. I would be belittling Al Pacio and Crowe if I attempt to say anything about their performances in the movie; words cannot describe it. I watched the movie eight times in a space of three months and bought the DVD to watch it couple more times. It gives me the feeling that this is what any movie should be about--reality, hard core reality exposing the corruption inherent in the systems we trust in. Be it CBS or Brown and Williamson, their corporate honchos must have squirmed in their seats while watching this movie (if they had the ticker to do so, that is). The courtroom scene needs special mention: ""Wipe that smirk off your face""--these six words actually set my heart pounding, making me feel as if he was shouting at me. It was so naturally done that I could almost feel I was there in the courtroom. Just watch it; no one will EVER regret to be an insider to the brilliance of THE INSIDER.",The Insider
