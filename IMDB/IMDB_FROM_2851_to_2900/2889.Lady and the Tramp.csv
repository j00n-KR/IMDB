0,TheLittleSongbird,Very rough around the edges and with not much heart of gold,4,11 May 2021,"The 1955 'Lady and the Tramp' film is still wonderful. Loved it as a little girl and to this day it is still my second favourite 50s Disney film after 'Sleeping Beauty'. Disney have been very variable when it comes to their live action remakes, tending to be visually impressive but not necessary and lacking the heart of the originals (some also suffering from trying to do too much or being too faithful). This is probably not a popular opinion, but of the remakes only 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella' were above good.While not hating it, this new live action version of 'Lady and the Tramp' was a disappointment in many ways. As a remake, it is unnecessary and a complete misfire especially with it having nowhere near enough of what makes the 1955 film so great and memorable. As a film on its own terms, it's also not very good while not being a complete waste of time. There are good things, but as far as the live action Disney remakes go, 'Lady and the Tramp' is towards the bottom.'Lady and the Tramp' looks good generally, especially the photography and the quite stunning recreation of the period. The music is mostly fine, at its best with ""Bella Notte"". When it comes to individual scenes, the best are the truly charming opening and the iconic spaghetti scene accompanying ""Bella Notte"" (not quite as magical this time around but still a lovely rendition).Although the cast didn't do much for me on the whole, there are a few winners. Justin Theroux does a nice job as Tramp, rough around the edges yet charming, and F. Murray Abraham portrays Tony with a real twinkle in his eye. It is though Sam Elliot's pitch perfect Trusty that shines best of all.However, there are exceptions when talking about the visuals as not everything looked good. The editing does look choppy in places and the dogs' mouth movements don't always sync and have some unintentional creepiness. Worse faring, and one of the aspects that sticks out like a very sore thumb, is the hideous look for the cats. The characters themselves are also a complete failure, with very little personality. While liking the music on the whole, ""What a Shame"" was an embarrassment and very out of place in the film and with the rest of the soundtrack.Most of the cast don't work, the humans are a mix of bland (with Jim Dear and Darling lacking warmth) and annoying (the dogcatcher does grate). And Tessa Thompson is just too brassy for Lady, which doesn't gel at all with how Lady looks. Ashley Jenson manages to make a caring and wise character like Jock obnoxious, the gender change being one of many puzzling and pointless changes. Others being anything to do with the cats, more of the dogcatcher (which was time wasting and repetitive generally) and of course the interracial marriage (not realistic for the period, or at least the attitudes towards them wouldn't have been). Found myself connecting with very few of the characters, including Lady. Tramp, Trusty and Tony fare best.Pacing feels erratic, rushed structurally from a feeling of things being left out in the editing room when they shouldn't have been and also dull from having next to no substance to nearly everything. There is nowhere near enough soul or charm, apart from two scenes, the chemistry between the characters didn't feel properly connected and it all feels too safe and like it was trying not to offend while managing to sort of doing so. The script can be awkward and cheesy, as well as too modern sounding.In conclusion, lacklustre. 4/10.",Lady and the Tramp
1,SnoopyStyle,not all fits the formula,6,3 December 2019,"Jim Dear brings home a dog for his wife Darling and they name her Lady. Street dog Tramp hides in her doghouse to escape the dogcatcher Elliott. He warns her that when ""Baby moves in, the dog moves out."" When the couple brings in newborn baby Lulu, Lady fears the worst. The family goes out of town leaving Lady in the care of Aunt Sarah. Lady is left on the street and rescued by the Tramp.This is fun while it lasts. The ending goes on too long and I don't think the CGI is necessary. Back in the day, there were plenty of Disney dog movies. There is a charm to them and the real dogs are perfect for family films. They may not be cinematic greatness but they are fine if done right. The new Disney formula of reworking every animated classic with CGI may not be a good one-size-fits-all. They do the spaghetti scene again but it doesn't have quite the same magic. This is not a franchise that is most known for its action realism. It needs charm, romance, and joy. This movie needs to take this into the G-rated romantic Disney family fun area. That's why real puppies may actually be what's truly needed in this case. CGI dogs talking don't add anything important.",Lady and the Tramp
2,nogodnomasters,The street is no place for a Dog,6,22 November 2019,"This is a continual Disney cash cow of remakes. They are good but are al generic in a way. The film takes place in the 1920s (?) Savannah, Georgia. They managed to but together real dog barking and dogs talking English very well, but there are computer programs that make such action easy for amateurs with a little practice.I loved Sam Elliot's voice for the bloodhound. Tessa Thompson as Lady sounded a lot like Emma Stone, but without the cute squeak in her voice which I thought would have worked better. I also thought a more comical voice for Tramp would have been better, like Ryan Reynolds with a few obscure Dead Pool lines tossed in. Real dogs greet each other by sniffing backs, Disney dogs do not.It is a good film, but not a rush out and buy.",Lady and the Tramp
3,Lejink,Dog's Breakfast,3,29 March 2020,"Well, we're in lockdown and while I anticipate looking back on this review in the future with this dread virus consigned to the past, in any case on a cold and rainy Saturday my wife and I will often pick out a Disney or Pixar feature as our matinee choice to hopefully happily pass the time. This particular recent movie was recommended to us by a friend although we perhaps should have realised with her being very much a Disney devotee that her judgment may have been a touch clouded by her brand-blindness.Actually I've never even seen the original 1955 feature and I'm kind of sorry after watching this live-action remake that I'll probably not be seeking it out anytime soon as my wife told me while watching this newie that it faithfully follows the plot of the earlier version very closely.Of course the story's delightful but I must admit I found it harder to accept real dogs speaking with each other rather than their cartoon equivalent. I noticed that this version runs thirty minutes longer despite telling the same story which is no doubt attributable to extended, I hesitate to call them action sequences and lots of additional dialogue inserted for extra expository or humorous purposes, all of which I could have done without. And as many here have stated, there is a heavy P.C. revisionist feel to it all starting from the young mixed-race couple who own Lady who I doubt would co-exist as happily as they seem to here with their very cosmopolitan-looking townsfolk in turn-of-the-century America.The acting by the humans in the cast was pretty rote from where I was sitting and while it was impossible for a dog-owner like me not to be moved by the big emotional set-ups, they were too obviously telegraphed by swelling background music designed to make you reach for your handkerchief. Some sparkling new dialogue or some really good fresh jokes might have helped too but in summary I just found it a rather flat viewing experience.I just didn't get the magical or feel-good feeling I was hoping for and for all those young children today being taken to see this unnecessary update I do hope it doesn't supercede the original as the library version of this evergreen tale.",Lady and the Tramp
4,cruise01,Lacking the fun and magic but an okay live action Disney film.,6,18 November 2019,"Lady and the Tramp (3 out of 5 stars).Lady and the Tramp is a decent live action family film that is based on the original animated film. The plot is similar about Lady a cocker spaniel puppy living with a married couple. Who starts a family. And Lady is thinking she is being forgotten. She runs away and meets a street dog Tramp which he shows her the streets and the city. While they both are falling in love with each other. While they are trying to avoid the dog pound patrol.It is a cute and lovable story. Sadly, the live action film's direction is missing out on the magic that made the animated film lovable and cute. The cast is decent with Thomas Mann and Kiersey Clemons playing the human characters which were underwritten. Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux playing Lady and Tramp voices.The visual effects are also decent. The direction was okay which was lacking its magical moments the animated film had.Overall, Lady and the Tramp is a fair film. The story is cute. The direction is lacking the magical and fun moments the animated movie did better on.",Lady and the Tramp
5,matthewssilverhammer,"Take note, Lion King:",7,14 January 2020,"If we simply MUST keep remaking these classic movies, then this is about the best we can hope for. It keeps the spirit and even the story structure but fleshes out different areas and casts the movie well-enough to warrant its existence. No emotion has been lost in our connection to the characters (in fact the Tramp's history is a nicely subtle addition), though the romance is far less convincing. FAR from a replacement to the masterful original, but also FAR from a total waste.",Lady and the Tramp
6,marmar-69780,lady and the tramp,4,16 November 2019,It started prety good it countinued to keep my interese but towards the end and its conclusion it started to drag a lot and for me it was little to long also honestly i think this adaption was kinda unnecesery,Lady and the Tramp
7,arfdawg-1,More Political Correctness from Disney,2,16 January 2020,"Disney has gone so left wing it just is a borefest now. This story line with the stoopid diversity and blended relationships at a time when there were no cars and only horse driven vehicles is ludicrous, to say the least.Walt must be spinning in his grave.Oh, and then there's the script which is down right snooze inducing. It's poorly directed with no consistent pace.Buh bye",Lady and the Tramp
8,lisafordeay,Cute movie based off the 1950s cartoon classic,7,15 November 2019,"Lady and the Tramp is the 4th remake Disney has made this year (Aladdin, Dumbo,The Lion King)and is the only one of the remakes not to get a theatrical release in the cinemas.
This reimagine is the same as the cartoon but with a few changes. One of the changes is Tramp was neglected by his real family as his owners wife had a baby and had no time for Tramp anymore and another is the we are siamese song is scrapped and instead we have a forgettable song that wont stick in your head.The story is cute and the voice cast is great too ranging from Justin Therox to Sam Elliot to even Ashley Jensen. If you are a dog lover then you will love this film. Another thing is the mixed race in this film compare to the original as Darling wasn't coloured and neither was the nanny.
Rating B",Lady and the Tramp
9,CubsandCulture,saccharine by itself is flavorless,4,9 December 2019,"I am sure young children would like this film. It is fanciful and light. It moves at a good clip and the scary bits are not too intense. But for any one older it is just too sweet. Much of the color of the original film has been drained out of this remake. The Tramp's character has been entirely re-written to have a ""tragic"" backstory and it neuters his social critic edge in the process. The cats are no longer supremely cat like but unmotivated antagonists. The film was designed to be completely unobjectionable by *anyone* and in the process all the particularity of the story was lost. This is just another talking dog film.",Lady and the Tramp
10,r96sk,"Needless? Yes. Enjoyable? Also, yes.",7,18 November 2020,"Needless? Yes. Enjoyable? Also, yes.I'm not entirely sure 'Lady and the Tramp' was a film that needed remaking but here we are. This 2019 production is solid. I like the way it is shot and brought to life. It's rewritten in a few parts, to mostly positive effect - though the original film is still, by a fair distance, best.I wouldn't say the cast are anything exceptional but they do what's needed. Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux give good performances as Lady and Tramp respectively, while Adrian Martinez's Elliot is probably the character I'll remember most - away from the two dogs, of course. Janelle Monáe, Sam Elliott and Yvette Nicole Brown are decent too; even if it is difficult to picture the latter as a baddie.They get rid of the ""The Siamese Cat Song"", though the replacement tune is actually fairly good. The other songs, like ""La La Lu"", remain but are obviously tinkered. The run time is longer, which I don't think was nessacary but they fill it well enough.Solid attempt.",Lady and the Tramp
11,rannynm,Beautiful Re-telling of the Disney Animated Classic,10,12 November 2019,"Lady and the Tramp (2019) is a beautiful re-telling of the Disney animated classic from 1955.
Lady, a Cocker Spaniel loves the comfort of home and lives with a nice family, but after the arrival of a baby, she feels left out. Tramp, a Scottish Terrier, is a street dog who loves to be free and believes he knows humans (or at least he thinks he does). They are not loyal like dogs. The two meet when Tramp is running away from the dog catcher Elliot (Adrian Martinez).Tramp advises Lady of a terrible rule: when the baby moves in, the dog moves out.When Lady's owners leave the house, she is under the care of a family member, Aunt Sarah, who is not into dogs and Lady ends up in the street. Tramp saves her from a dangerous situation and both dogs develop a friendship. They embark on an adventure and, despite their differences, they get to know humans better and understand the value of home.The original film was the 15th animated Disney movie and the first on cinemascope. This 2019 remake is Disney's first film in a new format called Univisium. I have never watched the original, but this new live-action version is absolutely worth seeing. The characters are very well cast, both humans and dogs. The film was shot in Georgia and the locations are beautiful. The art direction and photography create a warm and romantic atmosphere and recreates the U.S. in the beginning of the 20th century.My favorite scene is definitively the spaghetti scene. It is romantic. The way the restaurant owner and server treat Lady and Tramp with a special dinner and serenade is delightful. I can understand why is so iconic; it represents a genuine bond between two characters and how they come closer, despite their differences. It is also overwhelming how the humans, which are not owners, manifest their love for dogs.The voice-over actors give great personalities to their characters and the animators make the scenes real and believable using CGI. Elliot (Adrian Martinez) is very determined as a dog catcher and Martinez captures the perfect tone to make this character unique. I also love Ivette Nicole Brown as Aunt Sarah. She plays a sort of villain character in a very realistic way as well.
I love the music from composer Joseph Trapanese, it suits nicely the film well and transports the audience into the era this takes place.The message of the film is: dog's love is unconditional and they all deserve a home. I give Lady and the Tramp 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18 and adults as well.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

12,Foutainoflife,"Was It ""RUFF!"" Or Not?",6,15 November 2019,"This review is going to be hard.Lady and the Tramp is my all time favorite Disney film. I absolutely adore it. I was excited to see what they could do with a live action remake of this classic film. Let's just say that this has both good and bad points.Obviously, if I were a child watching this I would love and be fascinated by it. The dogs looked good and the story is still heartwarming and fun. It would be a great watch for a child. However, I'm not a child and I'm partial to the classic.The story is not presented with the same timeline as was laid out in the original. Some of the characters have been changed and it doesn't have the same songs.I felt it did a fair job in giving a bit more depth to the Tramp. His backstory was more complete. Lady, however, seemed to have lost some of her innocence.I wasn't overly impressed but it wasn't an awful film. It's just different. It is still an enjoyable watch for the whole family.",Lady and the Tramp
13,muamba_eats_toast,Lovely and heartwarming,8,24 March 2020,It's not perfect but just what I needed extremely cheerful and will warm your heart. Not as completely magical as the original but it's still pretty damn good as a remake compared to many others and certainly isn't a bad film.,Lady and the Tramp
14,Hollywood_Yoda,Expected More From Disney,5,24 December 2019,"When I heard about this film coming out, I was really excited about seeing it, as I was with the live action Lion King and Aladdin. However, much like the 2019 version of The Lion King, it was more disappointment.Why did Disney change so much of the story from the original animated classic? To appease everyone? Well, it didn't work, not everyone was appeased. First of all, the human cast was not bad, it was actually bearable. However, my issue is with what they did to Jock and Aunt Sarah's cats. Abysmal to say the least.Disney, you can do better.",Lady and the Tramp

16,tm-sheehan,Too Politically correct and no Peggy Lee credit,6,22 November 2019,"My Review- Lady and the Tramp 2019 Disney PlusMy rating 6:5 /10If it's your first introduction to Disney's Lady and the Tramp you'll probably love this new CGI 2019 version.It's super cute ,beautifully filmed but as a lover of the original 1955 version I was hoping for something very special and like all the recent Disney live action features I have real issues with Lady and the Tramp even more than usual.First and most important to me is the total lack of credit Disney has repeated in this version to Peggy Lee who co wrote the 2 main songs Bella Note and He's a Tramp with Sonny Burke in fact she sang He's a Tramp in the original animated version.
Lee co-wrote all the songs in the film and supplied the voices for three other characters: Darling, the woman who owns Lady, and Si and Am, the malicious Siamese cats who wreck Lady's happy home. I suppose after the long drawn out settlement she received before she died that the Estate has to relinquish credit but can you imagine the Rogers and Hammerstein or Gershwin Estate allowing this snub again.The singer also served as a partial model for Larson while he worked out the animation of Peg. Additional research for the character's movements took him to places not usually associated with Disney cartoons:
In this 2021 version the only composer mentioned in the credits is Joseph Trapaneze who composed the score and recorded it at MGM Scoring Stage at Sony Picture Studios to record his score to the new Disney live-action adaptation, Lady and the Tramp. Trapanese conducted a 98-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony through his thematic and sweeping emotional score, and ScoringSessions but he did not compose Bella Note or He's a Tramp.The other issue I have with this Lady and the Tramp is the political correctness and to know why did they replace The Siamese Cat song also written by Peggy Lee with a new song, ""What a Shame,"" which is sung by a pair of obnoxious Devon Rex felines who tear apart the family living room, so instead of faux-Asian sounds and ""we are Siamese if you please"" lyrics, Wonder and GianArthur reimagined the pair as would-be interior decorators who have their way while the owners are out of the house .Janelle Monáe's who's voice uncannily sounds like Peggy Lee,especially when she sings stays true to the original Disney version of ""He's a Tramp"" in her new swinging cover and her voice as Peg is really the only uncredited tribute to Peggy Lee.
The cast in this version are very good but the mixed racial household which in 1909 in a quaint mid western town would have been impossible is totally politically correct today but totally whitewashes and ignores the racial tensions of America at the time.Like I've said before on the reworking of Disney animated classics if you haven't seen the original you will probably love the updated cgi version but I find animated animals speaking dialogue enjoyable but real life looking cgi animals very hard to accept.",Lady and the Tramp

In this family film based on the 1955 animated classic of the same name, a cocker spaniel and a streetwise mutt fall in love.
.
This latest Disney reboot is one we didn't really need. Yes, ""Lady And The Tramp"" is sweet, familiar and cute but this live-action version is too long and forgettable. Although the voice talents are surprisingly good and well matched, it can't save the movie altogether. I would stick to rewatching the original classic and keep those iconic scenes in your memory.

24,fciocca,A movie made to launch the Disney streaming service,5,17 November 2019,"This movie was clearly made to launch Disney + streaming service, both were released the same exact date. It was a nice promotion move.Here we are with another live action remake from disney, as always technically speaking is really good, CGI is on point, it looks realistic, photography is nice as for lighting. ""Lady and the Trump"" is one of the Disney movie that I have watched the most in my childhood, and I had great expectations. Once I finished it, I was unimpressed. It's not good as the original, but is not even bad, it's... in the middle. It is entertaining enough not to feel bored. Unfortunately Disney decided to take a more realistic approach when it comes to CGI remakes, so character are not as expressive as in original movies: the iconic scene in the restaurant did not made me feel the same emotions that I felt when I watched the 1955 movie. They removed the two italian guys that sing to replace them with a generic and a latin guys. I know that the original scene was a stereotype, but it was funnier and more memorable.Acting is okay, almost all dogs came back. I was pleased to see again the Bulldog, a little bit disappointed by the new adaptation of Jock, that in this movie became a lady. It was my favourite character and they ruined it a little bit, but I also know that I cannot expect the exact same movie, so I just swallowed this change. Lily is practically the same, and the Trump adaptation is good enough, to bound with him.The issue with these remake is always the same: Disney decided to do them too realistic, character does not have any expression, ""Dumbo"" and ""The Lion King"" are two perfect examples of this. Is no surprise if generally people prefer original movies. These are products thought for families, so they should be funnier, and not so serious. Disney is perfectly able to do that: Pixar movies were like this and still are, so I don't understand why this company is keeping doing this ultra realistic stuff that lack of emotions.",Lady and the Tramp

2020
PG
Director: Charlie Bean
Starring: Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Sam Thompson, Ashley Jenson, Janelle Monae, Thomas Mann Kiersey Clemens, Yvette Nicole brown and Adrian Martinez etcOverall rating 95/100Lady and the tramp is a reimagining of the animated classic. It tells the love story of two dogs from opposite backgrounds falling in love and shows the importance of family and the loyalty. Wow another win for the live action remakes. Lady and the tramp bought the same charm from the original whilst also adding enough new plot to keep it fresh and relevant, lets talk about this more in detail.First of all the film had plenty of great nostalgic moments and a very charming and heart-warming tone. The film had so many classic moments from the original it was hard not to feel a familiar warmth. They executed all the original scenes excellently taking me and I am sure many others back to their childhoods. The film also managed to execute a very heart-warming and charming tone. The soundtrack and the connection between all the characters just made you fall in love with the movie. It did not need to be big and flashy it actually was better for being more grounded and charming.Next the voice cast, dog's, and the chemistry between them was executed very well. First of all, I think they casted the human characters very well to look and sound remarkably similar to the characters in the original animated movie. Especially Thomas Mann and Keirsey Clemens who played Jim Dear and Darling I thought they were cast perfectly and had the same charm and warmth as the original characters. I also thought the dogcatcher and Aunt Sarah despite being slightly different I didn't have a problem with it, and they were still as fun to watch. I also thought they got the design of the dogs spot on with. With the whole voice cast doing an excellent job especially Justin Theroux, Tessa Thompson and Janelle Monae as Lady, Tramp and Peg. I do also have to say that they managed to create excellent chemistry between Lady and Tramp that for me was even more charming and believable then the animated original.I do have two slight little nit-picks and that for me was the slightly distracting CGI on the dogs faces and the over the top dog catcher in places. For most of the film the dogs were real, but whenever they were talking it was very obvious that CGI was used to move their faces and it was slightly distracting for a little while but I did slowly get used to it so it wasn't to much of an issue for me. I did have a slight issue with the dog catcher played by Adrian Martinez. For me he was slightly to over the top and overused. He felt like he was just filling time for some of the movie which was a shame but this was my only real problem with the movie.Next I thought the cinematography was fantastic and it's humour was executed well. I thought the cinematography and mise en scene of the all the different locations within the film was beautiful. Whether it was the Darling's house, the railway station, a beautiful boat cruise the film was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. And one particular scene with Lady and Tramp laying on a hill looking at the stars was truly beautiful to watch and the added visual element of the fireflies made it that little bit more pleasing to the eye. The films humour was also executed well. With all the dog antics its hard not to laugh if you have a dog of your own. Lady and Tramp had some great comedic moments with each other and of course Trusty and Jock just like in the animated movie where hilarious and bounced off each other really well with Ashley Jenson and Sam Elliot voicing them both very well.My final two positives would be the films good amount of added plot and exploring deeper themes that the animated movie didn't execute as well. The film was not a shot for shot remake which I really appreciated. They added more comedic moments with Jock and her owner dressing her up which were executed well and added even more of a balanced comedic tone throughout. They added more dogs and changed some things up with the plot which was refreshing to see. They also went much deeper into the themes of animals being abandoned which I thought was handled very well and raised awareness of the issue. It also made you more emotionally connected to the story and the character of Tramp.Overall Lady and the Tramp is a fantastic live action remake that balances being faithful to the original material but also adding new components to the plot and characters whilst also keeping the same humour and charm.",Lady and the Tramp
26,eberkerbatur,Baby Moves in and Dog moves out (6.8),7,15 February 2021,"Of course, it did not enjoy the old animation, the majority mostly thought that way.
At first, I thought why they didn't animate this movie again, but maybe it's better like this live-action it does not hurt to try, and I think you have been successful.New Orleans and the city created around it was beautiful. I am happy with the images.
It is difficult to make animals talk they did it and I think they did it in the best way ever. I think there may be only minor changes that happened exactly with the old animation.I didn't like the soundtrack, I wish there were a few more tracks. I think it is little and not catchy except for the restaurant scene.
The restaurant scene was also my favorite scene in the movie, a scene that warms people's heart.In general, I think an average movie should be slightly above its rating. After watching, it is not very memorable, not remarkable but watched. I think it meets the expectation.",Lady and the Tramp

28,movieman6-413-929510,"Nice to watch with the family or the family, but the story remains known to connoisseurs of the animation",6,15 November 2019,"Lady and the Tramp is a live-action film version of the animation film of the same name from 1955. The film is directed by Charlie Bean, the director of The Lego Ninjago Movie.In the film, a couple takes a golden locker-spaniel dog into their home and call her Lady (voice of Tessa Thompson). Lady grows up well with a luxurious life together with all the dogs in her neighborhood. She thinks she knows what life looks like, but when she and a street corner called Tramp (voice of Justin Theroux) this changes. He gives her a glimpse of life on the street. In this way Lady learns that there is a whole different world that she does not know.When the owners of Lady have a baby, Lady notices that she is less important to her owners. Due to circumstances Lady accidentally ends up on the street. Lady knows how to survive in this unknown world. When she meets Tramp again, she asks him for help. In this way she learns from him how to survive on the street. Lady starts to like the street life, but still wants to go back to her owners. Tramp tries to help her find the home of her owners. During their search, the two should only try to stay out of the hands of the dog catcher (Adrian Martinez).This is another new live-action film from Disney where they actually copy a well-known animation film and put it in a modern twist. This is what they did this year with the film The Lion King, but here they had the problem that the animal characters could not really express their emotions in the film. At The Lion King, all animals were digitally filmed, but for this film, they really used dogs. In this way the dogs seem more realistic, but to give them a little more emotion with their facial posture they have used CGI. In this way the dogs sometimes appear a bit different in the film.Because the film is almost the same as the animation, the film may seem familiar and predictable to people familiar with the film. They have modified or removed some scenes, but this makes the film a bit less for the connoisseurs. Still, this can be a great film to watch with family or relatives, because for younger viewers, the film can look nice especially if they are not familiar with the animation. You could also simply watch the animation film again.The voice acting is done appropriately by the cast. Tessa Thompson comes across as someone who must leave her famous rich life behind for an unknown life on the street. Justin Theroux also provides good voice acting as a street dog who thinks he knows everything better, but secretly still lonely. Furthermore, the cast also consists of good actors who speak to the other dogs such as Sam Elliot, Ashley Jensen and Clancy Brown. The cast that the people play in the film also seem appropriate, but do not play such a large role in this film, because it is more about the dogs. Ken Jeong has a nice cameo, but Adrian Martinez looks a bit too cartoony as the dog catcher. He and the dogs take care of some situations that make the film lose its credibility and make it more of a film for children.",Lady and the Tramp
29,SilverOrlov,Nobody needs it,6,19 October 2021,"From time to time there were interesting moments. In many ways, the film goes alongside the narration of the old cartoon... but in general, it is completely meaningless, because every time in moments that caused some emotion in the cartoon, nothing happened here. And this is not because I grew up, but because these ""animated dolls"" were not able to convey that special charm that the same scenes in the cartoon evoked.At first, I treated this film as an understandable attempt to refresh the old story for a new generation of viewers, but after a certain moment of such almost sterile scenes I decided - NO. It is better to show today's children an old cartoon than this unsuccessful, in my opinion, attempt.",Lady and the Tramp
30,bhernandez2216,Full of love and joy compare to the original,10,21 April 2020,"Disney's Lady and the Tramp is one of the best live-action remake of 2019. It did the exact same scenes from the original Lady and the Tramp, it also has the best dog moments, and love. It added something new to the story that has never been told. I'm so glad that they added Lady and the Tramp spaghetti scene. Everybody enjoys the scene, just like in the original. I love this movie it makes me feel like I really love dogs much more than Cats. Cats are the worst, I'm not a cat person, I'm a dog person. And I'm glad I enjoyed it.",Lady and the Tramp
31,Hallelujah289,Better than other Disney remakes,7,20 March 2021,"Lady and the Tramp (2019) went straight to streaming unlike other Disney remakes like the Lion King one which went to theaters not long before. I like Lady and the Tramp better though. Having the actors made it a little less wooden. The song choices are also better-not lavish like having Beyoncé, but simple and nice nursery songs etc.Having a diverse cast is great for Disney but does ignore the context of the time. But the actors are great in their roles. However some acting moments does stretch credibility-particularly how Lady's owners Darling and Dear react to the incident with the cats (who are not Siamese) and with Tramp and the baby. They are trusting beyond belief!Other classic scenes become suspect when made into live action, such as with the Italians and the spaghetti. Strangely one of the actors speaks Spanish and then has an Italian accent that is pretty obviously exaggerated.Other than that, the story does have dramatic themes and classic characters. It's not as cold as The Lion King or as problematic as Aladdin even though both live action movies erase oppression by rewriting historical contexts.",Lady and the Tramp
32,koofasa,I never thought Disney could offend me,2,27 July 2020,"Movies are remade all of the time these days. Creators seem unable to come up with new stories to inspire the public. Disney screwed up, in my opinion, remaking this movie. The Woke crowd has rules that require movie makers to include diversity whenever possible and to not culturally appropriate another person's culture. The rules seem to go out the window when it comes to white people though. Here Disney wants us to believe that there were interracial couples at the turn of the 19th century. Also, the main street businesses would all be run by black entrepreneurs. The prosperous people sitting in the park are also black but there are plenty of white ""extras"" so we know this isn't Harlem. So, this woke version of Lady and the Tramp rewrites history for some unstated reason. If Disney wanted to show how hip we are to mixed marriages they should have set the story sometime after 1960 instead of 1860. I find it offensive that Disney considers the butchering of a great story is a considered a creative use of their time. If Disney found the truth of the time to be offensive, why not set the movie in modern day? I would not have been offended if they hadn't tried to rewrite history.",Lady and the Tramp

She then encounters ""The Tramp"" and they fall in love. The only thing keeping them away from each other in the dog catcher.Some people weren't too happy with this movie. I enjoyed it. I got the classy feel I wanted from this movie. There were some things I didn't like about it. The major thing was Tessa Thompson as Lady. It isn't like she is a bad actor because she has been in some good rolls that I have enjoyed her in, but in this movie she just didn't fit the part. There was also some times were the CGI didn't line up, but besides that the CGI was great. I thought the setting was pretty solid. It captured the classy feel of the original. I loved that with this film. I am also happy Disney didn't hire a bigger director. In the other three Disney live action movies that have hit theaters they have had big directors like Jon Favreau and Tim Burton. They decided to go smaller with this film. In my mind, that is the path they should take.Overall, Lady And The Tramp was a good film I would recommend for families.",Lady and the Tramp
36,edicionccq,Lady and The Tramp are back now in Live Action.,8,21 November 2019,"I will admit it. I didn't watch the original version of this movie. Not because it was animated. I didn't watch it because it's old and my expectations were low of the story. Therefore, when it was announced that it will be a remake in live action I decided to give it a try to the modern version.It's an excellent movie. The visuals are good and appealing for the current audiences. The voice acting is appropriate for every character. My biggest complain will be the music, I didn't knew it will be songs but some of them are good especially two of them, ""Bella Notte"" and ""He's a Tramp.""It's a good movie to kill time and watch with the family.

43,ajzeg,I did it! I watched all the live-action Disney remakes of 2019!,1,13 February 2020,"Well, except for that Maleficent sequel. I guess I'm not quite done yet. Darn. Anyway, Lady and the Tramp! Before watching the remake, I rewatched the original for the first time since I was a kid. I have to say, it might be one of my favourite Disney films! It's way better than I remember! For a movie about something so simple, it's pretty much just about dogs being dogs, they put in a lot of artistry, great writing and great voice acting! As for the remake, well, first of all, let me address the elephant in the room. You guys may have never heard of this remake. That's because they released it straight to Disney+. It never had a theatrical run. However, this movie does not have Disney Channel Original Movie-level production value like you might expect. It actually looks like something that could've been in theatres, I was impressed! It accurately captures the look of the original with a lot of colour and the CGI is decent. It's not as technically impressive as The Lion King, but I thought the animal characters in this were a lot more expressive than in that movie. It still looks weird sometimes and it can't hold a candle to the original animation, but it helps that dogs are just naturally very expressive animals. Also, they sometimes swap them out for real dogs. The voice acting I thought was quite good and the songs, though few there are, are good. They don't get butchered like in the other remakes, even though it suffers from the Lion King problem of sometime recycling the exact same recordings and cutting out one of the most memorable songs. However, with all that said, this movie sucks. It still suffers from the same problems as the other remakes, it's the exact same movie just in live-action. It adds some stuff here and there and it changes stuff here and there, but it's still beat-for-beat the exact same movie. Again, what is the point of watching this when the original is up on the exact same damn streaming service, right there, ready to watch? It's not like you get the experience of seeing the story and songs on the big screen, like with the other remakes. This movie was never in theatres! It has even less of a reason to exist! While the voice acting is good, the human acting just felt odd. They act modern and say modern things while in an early-20th century setting, but they also keep some of the original dialogue. It doesn't really mix well. Speaking of, this movie does try to make the story more ""woke"" and politically correct by diversifying the cast and taking out some of the more problematic and dated elements from the original, like the gender roles and racial stereotypes. While that's all well and good, they didn't update the setting. Lady and the Tramp is a timeless story. It could be set in any time period, but they chose to set it in the same time as the original but with a modern-day lens, which, again, feels weird. It's not like diversifying a fantasy setting, or even Dumbo, which took place in a circus. Lady and the Tramp was set in a very specific period in recent American history, a time period that wasn't so great for women, minorities and people of colour. I don't know, isn't it kind of more problematic to pretend that everything was good for everyone and everyone got along just fine? I know it's a Disney movie, looking at the past through rose-coloured glasses is kind of their thing, but it's 2020. I don't think sugarcoating history is really acceptable anymore. It definitely should've been set in modern-day. This movie also doesn't seem to understand the stylistic choices of the original. The original was shot from a dog's eye view, you rarely saw any human faces. It was also written from a dog's perspective and from their understanding of the world around them. There are WAY too many scenes with just humans in this movie, and the dogs understand humans just a little too well in this. It loses a lot of what made the original so unique and special. Overall, while not quite as bad as Aladdin or The Lion King, or even Beauty and the Beast (which I haven't seen but can guess that it sucks too), it's still a complete and utter waste of time. Don't bother with this one. Just watch the original, which is shorter and better.",Lady and the Tramp

It did bother me unlike some people not because it was interracial but it's because Disney stuck that in there that made no sense. If it took place in more modern time it would be fine but not at the turn of the century..it was not allowed and these people would have been arrested. What was up with the cat song. As a child I loved that song. It was as they were trying to whitewash some things and not others. Really why make Jock a girl...what a stupid move.

I won't spoil anything, but it can be a nice remake with some moments that do try to be a little different from the original film, even towards the end. The visuals are great and the cinematography makes the movie give a nice look of New Orleans. However, it's still a Disney remake. Okay, Disney remakes are not always bad. Most can turn out good in the end with how their execution makes them work. But the story in this movie is kinda the same thing like the original movie. The musical numbers aren't better than the ones in the original movie. And the characters are rather a mixed bag. Some can offer nice development, some others are, well, kind of the same ones in the original movie. Now, this movie has debuted Disney Plus originals with a remake to Lady and the Tramp.

As is standard for these, it doesn't stray too far from the original storyline, but the movie is updated for modern day audiences with mixed race couples and a complete reimagining of the racially insensitive Siamese cats. This was complete appropriate but, sadly, the new song fails to live up to the standard set by ""We Are Siamese"". We are treated, however, to a wonderful rendition of ""He's A Tramp"" by Janelle Monáe.

They've done it with 101 Dalmatians, Peter Pan, and plenty other films but nowadays it's so much at once and they really want to force these animal adaptions, maleficent was solid, cinderella, Jungle book, Beauty and the beast, Christopher Robin were also all pretty good, they worked very well with jungle book as far as the animal recreations. But ever since 2019 it's been going downhill. Maybe it's because they're really pushing the envelope with these films all at once. Literally a live action Disney film once a year was good enough. But this year we've gotten 4 live action adaptions so Disney can make more money off of stuff they already made. It's absurd, Dumbo was mediocre, Aladdin was ehh, lion king was a huge disappointment and this is even worse. Shame on you disney and I can't believe you people buy this crap.

The ""modern"" Lady in the Tramp has a female Scottie instead of a male, random interracial couples, which were against the law in Savannah at the time, and a progressive version of the 1900s which will make you barf because it's so unrealistic and not historically correct whatsoever.Tramp is a jerk, not to say that he wasn't it the original, and the best part is, Justin throw gives him a lifeless rendition with his horrible voice acting. In fact, the voice acting all around in this film, as well as the CDI puppies, is horrendous and you can tell that none of the people hear our voice actor or actress veterans, in fact they're quite green.As Tramp is a stray, so does the story stray from the original and turns into a ""Progressive"" nigntmare that only ends after an hour and 30 minutes, but luckily I didn't endure it and instead had a great nap because man is this film boring and paced so slow that sloths could crawl faster than this movie moves.An all-around horrible film that should never have been made. These quote-unquote rescue dogs look to be pretty well bread for rescue animals, and the whole story is just nonsensical, stupid and boring.

And although some of the live action remakes have been fun to watch, this one really... well, it just wasn't fun. I didn't notice anything inappropriate or upsetting. I just could barely pay attention. I ended up working on a puzzle, letting it play through all the way and still irritated with it playing through long before the end. Who knows? There could have been stuff some folks would want a warning about that I just wouldn't have noticed since it was so unwatchable for me, a very poor remake. Anyone who knows me would be tempted to think it was because the original Lady and the Tramp movie was so high among my faves. But I really do not think that was it, even if it would be for some fans. I'd warn people off of this one, although I will say that they did change a few things that I found to be odd or even bad choices. But overall it seemed to me more like it might have if it had been very low budget from unknowns rather than from a giant of the entertainment industry with real Disney source material before the company grew into something so very different than the original company had been.

50,pintaxandre,A very mixed bag with some heart even if the story was already told.,6,15 April 2020,"A well shot and directed movie with beautiful decors. It is visually stunning and there is a very appreciable work on the colors.
Some well handled CGI EXCEPT when it comes to the dogs talking (Lady mainly). It looks horrendous, stop trying to make animals talk like humans. The remake of the Lion King made it way better.
The two main characters are well handled throughout the movie, you understand how they get along together and their evolution. The other characters are jsut caricatures and dumb (especially human ones). It's not that they are necessarily written to be dumb, but they are pictured to be dumb and it is so nerving.
The plot is also flawed, but I guess it is average in such a movie. However I have a problem with geography. Throughout the whole movie, the story takes place in the city in a few spots. The spectator has no clue about space in that area. But when you make the dogs go on a hill above the city and that they get chased until they reached the train storage that is in the middle of the city, it is kind of hard to ignore the fact that they don't give a damn about physical distances. It is representative of the attention to details that severely lacks in this movie.

Why did they have to have an interracial relationship during a time period where that would've been illegal? I agree with another comment, update the time period then. I'm not Asian so I get that it might not be my place but was the we are siamese part that bad that it had to be omitted and replaced with what imo was offensive to black people?! One of my biggest gripes honestly was I think lady's voice was miscast. Lady had a delicate and sweet voice and I think they should've done that in this one too, she was a delicate little lady which was the basis for the majority of the movie.

Adorable dogs and some lovely music. Heartfelt movie that got me teary eyed at times, and was full of love that made me smile. Charming world.Explaining why the movie isn't more highly rated:I'd never seen the old cartoon movie so everyone's blah blah blah about how this wasn't as good as the original...means nothing to me. Couldn't care less about some old cartoon movie from the nineteen-fifties.So I can review this without bias... unlike the majority of the reviews which are from lovers of the old cartoon.The second reason I see reviewers bandwagon-hating this movie is ""historical accuracy"" in regards to racism that plagued the 1950s. My response to that is simple: As with any fictional story, such as this one with *talking doooogs*....HELLO!......it can perfectly well be imagined as being in a parallel universe where dogs can talk and racism never happened. This isn't a historical epic like The King's Speech or Saving Private Ryan. It is a cheerful Disney movie. I've heard friends in real life complaining about non-white people getting roles that were previously given to white people. It is so sad hearing these friends complaining about this all the while claiming to not be racist...when their focus is obviously on...race. It is important that our children see people of all ethnicities in lead roles in the Disney movies. These movies present for our children, lovely worlds full of wonder and nice people. Ideal worlds for them to strive for. Where people of every ethnicity can be a role-model. A lesson the movie makers have learned, is that these movies are more charming with the old world atmosphere of Model-Ts horse carriages and street lamps. Like Marry Poppins or Beauty and the Beast, Lady and the Tramp too is far better portrayed in that old world atmosphere. To make it in modern times would require the inclusion of so many modern things like mobile phones et cetera, that it would fail to be charming and other-worldly. So many failed movies of this genre made that exact mistake. So Disney was left with the option to make that mistake and satisfy the race-obsessed historical accuracy obsessed crowds, orrrr, to create a beautiful world free of racism as it should've always been. The land of Disney is and has always been a dream-land. I couldn't be more grateful to the makers of Lady and the Tramp for making this dream world as they did.",Lady and the Tramp

For the past several years Disney has been cranking out these remakes to much success, but with many wondering why these films are remade in the first place. Lady and Tramp's release on Disney+ may prove to be a new home for these remake films, though we might have to see what the future holds.The Lady and the Tramp live action remake is for the most part just fine. It is a beautiful looking film and manages to look high budget but also looking like a mix between a TV film and a theatrical release. It is also very fun film. It retreads familiar territory and doesn't add much new, but it's still a fun time of you want to use up 2hrs and watch this. The cast is very good and play their roles well especially Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux.However, being so familiar maybe to the film's detriment as well as its Tv-esque quality, but it seems that might have been the point. The CGI with the dogs can be awkward at times with the way their mouths move as well as their CGI enhanced eyes, but it still is able to remain cute.Overall, Lady and Tramp is perfectly fine, if not a little disposable.

61,applegrrls,Disney did their homework on REAL HISTORY & RACE! If u want 2 know more...,10,20 November 2019,"It's clear Disney did their homework on race, as in the early 1900 many blacks were thriving post slavery until laws were designed to specifically hinder such progress. At that time there were not only thriving cities founded by blacks, but there were also some as in the true story of the ""Free State of Jones"" which were founded based upon mixed race communities thriving together intentionally. This film looks set in what could be a very burgeoning black city, district or neighborhood... Which would not be an uncommon place for an interracial couple to safely live out their married lives at that time. No law has ever stopped love or relationships... People of all types have always mixed. People didn't begin as colorful & nuanced as we are today... Someone's love made that possible. AND despite the number of photographs in books, this still seems to be the first time some reviewers have seen blacks in these types of period clothes or driving early cars. It's sad that people are still so guided by race because race wasn't even part of the plot... The story was STILL about love. As for our family? We laughed so many times, and we cried so many tears watching this remake. We still love the near shot for shot remake. I didn't know so many are completely uninformed about actual African-American history. A great place to begin to know more is the books, ""The Original Black Elite"" by Elizabeth Dowling Taylor, ""Black Fortunes"" by Shomari Wills, ""The Senator and the Socialite"" by Lawrence Otis Graham, and ""Prince of Darkness"" by Shane White. None of these books are written by me, all are available on Amazon, and they all tell their stories from emancipation through Jim Crow. An era too few seem to know anything about.

I volunteer in a Victorian mansion and happen to love the decor and costumes in the movie. The fact that they took some artistic liberties to better suit the time-period of the viewers should really not matter. Again, TALKING DOGS. If you are a purist who cannot handle any changes to a plot, then maybe it's not for you but if you want to just watch a light, family-friendly movie then I would recommend this one. I was a little sad about a few of the choices that were made (zoo, music, Jock), but to fix that - I can always return to the animated classic which still exists and this film in no way changes that, so calm down people.

The animation is atrocious, the voice acting is lousy and annoying and the writing is just terrible and utterly cheesy. Furthermore, this remake is politically correct garbage all the way. What's with the role hand-outs to black people? I mean, half the cast is black and the Lady's owners are a black and white couple. Is that supposed to be a truthful representation of the early 1900's (and the remake) which this movie is set in? I really wish Disney would just stop making garbage like this. It's kind of like when Kim Jong-un removed his uncle from all pictures he was in. It was supposed to be like he never existed but was obvious what had happened. This is kind of similar but worse. The pinnacle of this idiocy being that aunt Sarah criticizes Jim Dear for being a musician while his wife is a house keeper all the while they live in a rather nice house. Also, if there was one thing they should've changed it should've been those ridiculous names Jim Dear and Darling. This remake is just dumb, pointless and especially annoying to watch.",Lady and the Tramp

Haha!Truth is there is so much wrong with this live action remake, from the fact they left out the beaver scene (Which I always found hilarious!) to the devastating and almost unforgivable absence of Trusty being crushed by the carriage!
(As a child that scene was so significant!)However, it made up for it in other ways.Jock being female in this version was a risk but was absolutely brilliant. I haven't checked the cast for the film so if it is a male then that's even better! Haha! The campness around that dog was so refreshing in this day and age! +1 Point.Lady playing a more serious role in the final dramatic scene was very well done and made it feel more authentic in the 'love story' side of things.
She risked her life for him. That's pretty damn cute!
+2 Points.And finally, the fact the film had the decency to keep the original spaghetti scene! 😍
With an extra umpfh too! 😍So, I couldn't give it more of a rating that I did, not anything major really. It's satisfying and well worth a watch and better than the original in some ways, but in a lot of other ways it's not.Genuinely a great 2 Hours of story and different character development, while keeping the true feel being it'Really enjoyed this film regardless of its mistakes!😜",Lady and the Tramp
78,djozone001,How to remake a beloved classic,8,19 November 2019,"After sitting through the emotionless pit of despair that was the unnecessary CGI remake of The Lion King (2019), I was skeptical to watch another remake of a beloved Disney classic. Since having the streaming service I was eventually going to watch it just for the hell of it.I just finished it and I was absolutely moved in ways I wasn't expecting. They went with a Disney classic type of film rather than a shot for shot cash grab. This was a story that was told beautifully by the dogs and the CGI team at work. Had there been some more movement on the mouths when they were singing, I would've been more impressed. Regardless, this had one thing that made a classic like this so memorable: the music. The soft harmonies of the 1920's to set the mood of the movie. Truly is a treat to take in from the very beginning of the film. The color blind casting is a nice touch to help draw in all audiences.There's enough here to feel gleeful at and just sit back and let the magic of a Disney film keep you starry-eyed. It's funny, heartfelt, and it's the kind of thing that should be taken notice of for future remakes (i.e., Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Treasure Planet)",Lady and the Tramp

Please Disney, do some test reviews before you go this far out of what's believable by the viewer or shift the story line so that it works better. I can't imagine the ticket sales you lost over this.

With Jarring and unnecessary PC changes and missing some of the best bits from the Original, this just missed the mark completely for me. Disney should really have updated the setting rather than keep the early 1900s period as many have said before.

(The Mountain Between Us for one) Think of it like this - Dr Martin Luther King Jr played by a Hispanic lead. Abraham Lincoln played by a person of color. It is a disconnect that defines logic and the average person just can't get over no matter how much you want to see it work. They had no chemistry on scene together. It was like two separate actors that happened to be on the same stage. They barely looked at each other. The ""We are Siamese"" song. Ok, I think Disney just said hey we want to do something different (Since everything else is) well, ok I'm ok with replacing a classic song BUT, it should be with ANOTHER classic song. The cat song was flat and disjointed, maybe it should have been rap? I have to admit, I didn't finish watching it, we made it about 3/4 through and it just... well, was like watching MLK jr played by a white person.

Got me right in the feels a few times. Yes making Jock a girl was pointless and Jim and Darling being interracial was controversial and not likely in that time era in the south was not bothersome to me, she had a great voice and they made aunt Sarah more entertaining than some old random lady in the original.

I had no problem with an interracial couple, except that they are still living in the early 1900's. I'm pretty sure that sort of thing was illegal in most states at that time. Why not update the story to 2019? Or even the 80's or 90's? It's difficult to be culturally diverse when you are setting a film in lily white turn of the century midwestern society. At the end of the day this is just a watered down copy of the original. Is the Siamese cat depiction offensive? Sure. It is what it is for the times, though.

Lady and the Tramp is no exception. It is for the most part, an enjoyable movie, beautifully shot, with a wonderful cast and adorable dogs. Although the CGI for the animals talking was a bit subpar.
The real issue I had with the movie is that it just didn't seem to have any heart. It felt like it was just checking off a list based on what took place in the original and that was it.

106,Kunovega,"Not terrible, just pointless.",5,19 November 2019,"As a story this doesn't really present anything that wasn't in the original film. If anything it loses some of the magic that comes from classic animation.Watching this live action just ramps up the absurd nature of the way it's presented. Watching two cartoon chefs feed some dogs in the original is cute; but, watching two live action humans do it in this makes you wonder why they aren't locked up as lunatics. Bringing them a table, a menu, singing to them while they eat, etc.And the absurd antics of the dog catcher come off no better. He's some over the top parody that never feels real.Then there's the coloration and design of the dogs, Tramp comes off as an old man basically taking advantage of a tiny young Lady. The cartoon design holds up without making you think about age difference, but this coloration and size for the CGI/live dogs translates really weird for me.Basically the cartoon is cute and funny, but the live action is a lot of cringe.Also, for some reason they shoe-horned in diversity and made the main couple a mixed race couple, if this were a modern day setting I wouldn't care, but given the time period this was supposed to be set within, that would not be common. It's just one more strange design choice for anyone aware of history. I'm not knocking any points off for this by itself, but it was one more odd aspect of the film on top of a lot of just bleh design choices.",Lady and the Tramp
107,Sean Kerr,Decent but Confused,6,29 March 2020,"Watched this the night after watching the original again, which I'd rate at 8/10. Overall I quite enjoyed it but feel they should have either not tried to make it woke or modernised it completely and set the story in modern times, rather than the early 1900s, as per the original. The result was confused. Examples:
1. The human character actors behaved and spoke like modern day people. Just didn't fit with the period surroundings and clothing.
2. The racial diversity would have been illegal in many southern US states in those days.
3. Why change the gender of Jock to a female (Jockaline)? Pointless diversity.
4. The Siamese cats changed and the hilarious ""We Are Siamese"" song and associated choreography replaced. Come on!Apart from that, the hilarious beaver scene is gone, as is the equally brilliant ""bum, bum, bum ruff"" from the bulldog during the song ""He's a Tramp"".On the plus side, some of the voiceovers are great and the dog scenes keep it going.Shame, could have been so much better but still worth a watch I'd say.",Lady and the Tramp

Jim Dear and Darling didn't really act like themselves. In the original, they weren't that ignorant of Lady's needs and introduced her to the baby right away-this is important for dogs to learn the baby's place in the pack/family.I didn't mind Jacque being a girl, but it was weird at first. Jacque and Trusty really seemed stupid though.The cats not being Siamese made no sense, especially when they got a song anyway.And I hated that The Tramp didn't call Lady ""Pigeon,"" or ""Pidge.""

115,robinreyes_ce,Good but not as good as the Cartoon version,7,19 June 2020,"I was so excited to watch one of my favorite classic cartoon ""The Lady and the Tramp"" in its live version. However, after watching it, the feeling that I felt was not as ecstatic when I watched the original version.First thing that made me wonder is that the lady owner and her auntie became black. Though in current time it is not an issue but during the setting of early 1900's, I think that is incorrect. Nevertheless, it's a fiction so this is not an issue to me.I also missed Si and Am, the two Siamese cats and their very entertaining Chinese-like melody. It was replaced by two male cats with a not so appealing cats, which I find not a good replacement.However, I was not disappointed in the ""Bella Notte"" scene. It was as romantic as it was in the cartoon version. Although the new version doesn't sound like Italian, but it was as romantic as before.The ""He's a Tramp"" number inside the dog pound is not as fabulous as in the original version that uses other dogs as the background and back-up singers. You will not hear that in this new version but in fairness it was not that bad at all.Trusty's crash scene was deleted. Instead it was Tramp that was lying on the street after the crash scene. I don't know but I was more emotional when it was Trusty that was hit instead of Tramp. Hence, I was not moved in that scene as I was in the cartoon version.And the last scene that I was truly missed in this live version is that Lady and Tramp had four puppies. The three are lookalike of Lady and the only male puppy is Tramp lookalike. This for me is the most amazing happy ending the movie should have. But it was deleted in this live version.Overall, I find the movie entertaining with some additional stories.

If you're going to remake a Disney movie, then you need to make it practical and keep with like the original. The first thing that got under my skin was Darling. No, I am NOT racist, but in 1955 interracial marriage just wasn't a thing. Two the baby was a boy in the original, The cats were supposed to be siamese and they sung the wrong song.

How many movies exist from this timeline that have all white people?? Why have another one?! This is fictional, not historical (singing dogs). I think changing the cat song was also a great call-but it still is a crazy stressful song! Cringe!The essence of this film is the same and I think it's cute. Kids will love it. Our dogs loved it. I think Janelle Monae did an ok job with Peggy Lee's song. There are parts of the original that will always be better, but the changes and updates to the story stand on their own just fine.

It's a breed of cat for Christ sake. The replacement scene is boring, dull and the worst part of the movie.The rest of the movie is decent but with the sad Siamese cat replacement scene, something feels missing and personally I would recommend sticking with the original.",Lady and the Tramp
126,123dontgo,Too politically correct tbh,4,17 January 2020,"The original Lady and The Tramp was basically my favourite movie when I was a kid, and I still love it today. However, while this one had some good stuff here and there, I was disappointed by the time the credits rolled.They changed too much things and didn't even bother to recapture the spirit the original had. I know that remakes can't exactly be like the original and I'm fine with that, but when you make a remake, you should at least try to recapture the original's spirit.First of all, the film seemed to be more focused on being ""woke"" and stuff. I don't have that much of a problem with Jim and Darling now being an interracial couple in the 1920s/30s/whatever decade this takes place in (though I would've preferred if the setting was moved up to the 60s or more modern decades if they wanted more diversity but I don't really care), but the gender changes seemed unnecessary.Another thing is that Lady's voice actress was miscast IMO. Like another reviewer said, Lady's voice is supposed to sound more soft and sweet. They should've cast someone who could have such a voice.Next, the new cat song wasn't really that good. Now I understand they wanted to avoid being potentially offensive, but the song just felt too... generic and vanilla.The scene where they fight the stray dogs was watered down in this version. It's just one stray dog instead of three, and while some parts were funny (such as when Lady pretends she has rabies to try scaring off the stray), it's just so... watered-down.Next, they got rid of the funny beaver scene and replaced it with a boring one where the beaver is now... a statue. WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE ORIGINAL ONE!?I also noticed that in the scene where we see the pound after the dog catcher takes Lady, they got rid of the song that the dogs sing before Lady is taken to the pound. The Chihuahua was also omitted. I'm a Central American and I never found the Chihuahua offensive.The scene where they save Tramp is probably the worst offender. It's supposed to be intense, but instead it's uncomfortably watered down. When Trusty gets his sense of smell back, there was also some clearly shoved-in ""you must believe in yourself"" crap that could've been well-done but was instead poorly executed.What made the original ""saving tramp"" scene intense was that when they found the wagon and started chasing it, there was no spoken dialogue (except from the dog catcher), just fast-paced music and howls.In this film's rendition of said scene, they took out what made it intense.At least Aunt Sarah isn't a Karma Houdini in this one, the spaghetti scene manages to live up to the original, and the Trusty in this film stays true to the original Trusty.However, if you like this film, that's OK. Just because you like it does not make you an SJW.I'm giving it a 4 because the dogs who acted in this film did end up in loving homes, and there were a few good moments here and there. Plus, the dogs at least showed more emotion than the CGI animals in the ""The Lion King"" remake. The CGI may have not been as good, but it's an upgrade compared to the CGI they used in the Air Buddies films. It could've been worse.I will still be sticking with the original, though. This remake may have sucked, but that doesn't mean the amazing original will cease to exist.",Lady and the Tramp

I understand that the Jerry Lee Lewis fake Asian voice of the original was def rasist, but they could have stayed in the film with their song without the voices.

132,dawnofthedaleks,"Not as Good as the Classic, or the sequel to the classic",8,16 November 2021,"Spoilers, sorry, but I like to share what I like and don't like about a movie. I enjoyed the CGI and the acting. Especially the casting of Sam Elliot as Trusty which was perfect, but I must say this strayed too far from the classic for me to call it a truly good remake. Feisty Lady with more sense of humor and less snobbishness is a welcome change, as is the more proactive roles of Jim Dear and Darling to protect their dog and rescue Tramp, but the romance is all but extinguished, the change of Jock to Jacqueline seems frivolous and unnecessary, trying to ring humor out of what was a classically serious character and WAY too much time was spent on her being dressed up and the arguably insane dog catcher. The pound is made to seem like more of an inconvenience than a dank miserable prison, as it is too brightly lit, all the dogs seem happy and clean and borderline playful, so where there could have been a serious moment of warning here, it's reduced to a vague indication that old Nutsy took the long walk through the one way door with none of the overwhelming dread that implies in the 1955 version. The cats are an understandable alteration considering their racial implications in the original. But really...really? Did we NEED to cut the puppies out of it? I mean, yes, we all know a schnauzer and a cocker spaniel will not produce a litter of three perfect pure bred cocker spaniels and one tiny adorable miniature schnauzer, but think of all the adorable combinations of features Disney failed to create and warm our hearts with here! No live action Scamp?! WHY?! Like another critic said, it's sweet and enjoyable, but you get the feeling Disney wanted to push it out just to check it off a to do list as opposed to throwing all they had into it like Beauty and the Beast or Lion King or Aladdin or Jungle Book. Even Dumbo showed more thought to a classic character reinvigorated and Cruella while confusing was bold and dynamic. Worth a watch, but don't expect the magic of the Disney classic. Still better than Mulan.",Lady and the Tramp

It's like a bizarre Twilight Zone episode where they dropped 2019 society in 1909. Set the movie in in the 1970s-2010s and all these problems go away, easily.On the entertainment level, it's boring. Nothing exciting, nothing to make the film memorable in any way whatsoever. The voice casting is all wrong for Lady and Tramp. Tessa Thompson just doesn't have the same tonal sound as the original which is not her fault, it's just bad casting. Theroux as the Tramp doesn't feel as vibrant as the original. I'm not going to even get into the cats or other characters because that's like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic with the foundational problems.One good quality, if you've ever been to Savannah, Georgia, you can see how its beauty permeates the film.

Another thing I want to tell Hollywood is biracial women are not the only face of black women, there are a plethora of beautiful dark skinned black women that can act very well but for some reason they are barely ever used in movies unless they are single mothers, slaves, or crackheads and none of these are my reality! The fashion was atrocious! The shirt the husband had on at the baby shower was super girly. This grown man had garter belts around his arms, that is what strippers wear I'm sure he would have been the laughing stock of the town had he worn that ugly shirt in the early 1900s because interracial marriage and overly flamboyant clothing was not acceptable back then! Why was the police officer a man of color and a black man owning a business in the city in the early 1900s?! YEAH RIGHT Stop trying to rewrite history just to gain an audience I'd rather you keep it real about how life really was for black people instead of changing the whole story just to pander to us black folks! I was fine with the original story just like I was fine with the caucasian Spider-Man, and I was fine with a caucasian mermaid! When they change the character for us they always put us in interracial marriages as if black love does not exist, and it does! If you gonna give us a black Spider-Man and a black mermaid can they at least be attracted or married to a black woman/man?! So tired of Hollywood and their agenda!

Which is why Disney has become a politically correct joke that can't hold a candle to Disney's former glory. Also, the C.G.I. in this film is laughable. Music in this remake is more soulless and isn't dripping with finesse like the original film's soundtrack that was made in 1955. Left-leaning extremists have ruined the fun of Disney films and other films in the American ""entertainment"" industry. From what I know, most current films now have an anti-intellectual political agenda because they don't try to challenge people because they're trying to not offend people, which is not good news for comedic geniuses who want to experiment with politically incorrect jokes.

176,scamp4553,"Pales In Comparison To The Original And The Sequel, But Still Solid",6,10 February 2021,"I'm a lifelong fan of this franchise, having seen the original and its DTV sequel a lot as a child but not getting as heavily into the franchise until my teenage years. This is the Disney property that I hold closest to my heart for many reasons, so naturally, when a remake of the original was announced for Disney+, I became excited but a little wary. The remakes Disney has been pumping out like popsicles on a summer day are truly overwhelming for a lot of Disney fans with many criticizing them, even though critically they seem to get an average response. For example, this movie is hovering in the 60-70 percent range of Rotten Tomatoes, so even the streaming method can't avoid the notoriety bug from fans. I stated that a ""Lady And The Tramp"" remake can work so long as the story flows solidly and the movie feels geniune, and what did we get with the overall film? For those unaware of ""Lady And The Tramp"" as a story, and who wouldn't be, this is the tale set in the late 1900's and early 1910's of a housedog named Lady. She ends up being romantically linked to a street dog who is given various different names by the inhabitants of the town he roams but is referred to as Tramp as the movie goes on. Nothing much that's new to go over in terms of plot because it is a basic story that the original did a great job at telling. As for this movie's story and how true it is to the original, there is a stark difference. While they do keep most of the story elements the same as before, this remake is more dialogue driven to get the pacing going. This means that we get an abundance of basic plotpoints whereas the first movie felt like it was wholly new and felt like it was a more original story. Obviously. Some of the changes they make to the characters are solidly handled in my opinion. Jock is now female, Si and Am are not Siamese Cats and their song is different, and there is a lot more racial diversity in this movie than the original. Some people are obviously going to have problems with this, but these changes don't affect anything storywise in my opinion, and the movie isn't distracting in that way. The voice actors are well cast, especially in the two leads. Tessa Thompson is Lady, and does her job well, but the real star of this movie is Justin Theroux as Tramp. Obviously, Theroux doesn't come close to Larry Roberts in the original film or even Jeff Bennett in all of the other LATT properties, but I feel that Theroux succeeds in his own way, as kind of a sarcastic loner. His performance really makes this film watchable, and the other actors are solid as well, whether they be the canine characters or live action characters.There's a massive story quarrel I have with this film, though. If you wondering if it's the animation of the dog characters that I will be nitpicking, well, you're incorrect. The CGI on the dogs is at least more expressive than in the remake of ""The Lion King"", and they at least tried, so I'll give them that. What I do have a problem with is the third act of the movie. If you've seen this movie, you are well aware that it concludes with a fight between Tramp and the rat, leading to a misunderstanding that causes Tramp to be placed in the back of the dogcatcher's carriage. This leads to Lady, Tramp, and Jock racing to stop the carriage in order to rescue him from the fate of certain death, which they're successful in doing. However, the dogcatcher's carriage unintentionally lands on Trusty when they make it fall sideways, and he's supposedly ""dead"". In this movie, it's different. The scene plays out like it does in the original, only in this film, instead of Trusty being the one that falls victim to the carriage, it's the Tramp. This then leads to a cliched scene that I'm so tired of in movies like this. Tramp is laying there ""dead"", and Lady mopes and cries around hoping that he'll wake back up, but it isn't likely that he'll come back. She then howls mournfully and the Tramp wakes back up and everyone is chipper again. SWEET MERCY am I sick of seeing this cliche in Disney movies and any movie involving talking animals. It's like the studio got involved and told all the writers to include that cliche to make it more ""modern"". Well, you know what, it's dated!I'm well aware that this cliche was utilized in the sequel, but here's the thing with that scene. When Scamp gets thrown up against that wall and gets knocked out, that scene doesn't lose its momentum. It happens during the brawl with Tramp, Scamp, and Reggie, and Tramp doesn't all of a sudden stop what he is doing and mope around for a few minutes. After the Tramp knocks Reggie out, is it then where he goes over to wake Scamp up, and there isn't some focus grouped monologue where Tramp pleas for Scamp to wake up and to not ""die"". And it was one of the Disney sequels. This is a Disney remake. They should not have used a scene that is ripped right out of the end of ""Alpha And Omega"" or ""Oliver And Company"" or some other film where this happens. Those two movies did it in a more pointless and worse way (while still being solid films), but this still didn't execute it in a way that warrants it as new or invigorating, or with real tension. I'm shocked that there wasn't any unnecessary rain that coincidentally decided to start pouring down on them while that scene took place. This is just a scene put in to make the movie more hip and modern, when in reality, it's a cliche that should not have existed in an otherwise solid movie, because if anything, it makes it older than the original film. Not only that, but it's also cynical in a way in order to play with the audience's emotions, which isn't necessary.So, yeah, I just needed to throw that out there. But other than that, I think that the remake of ""Lady And The Tramp"" is not a bad movie. Not at all. Should I argue that it's unnecessary considering the recent cornucopia of live action remakes that have come out of Disney lately? I think so, because this is sort of like wasted calorie food so to speak. It's something you don't need to put into your system but it still satisfies you in a solid way. That's my description of this ""Lady And The Tramp"" remake. It is NOWHERE near the original film in terms of quality, as that film still represents the best of Walt Disney's output in my opinion, and I personally think that it is my favorite movie of all time at this point. The sequel is also high up there, even though I do acknowledge that it is not a perfect film and my love for it is mainly due to the nostalgia I have for it and how much it helped me through a very questionable period of time. I'm not hesitant to reveal that at all. This film is not in the same perfect league as the two canon films in my opinion, but it still works with what it has and director Charlie Bean and the other personnel tried their best to recapture the original film in a more modern setting to decent results. Again, I may be a bit biased because ""Lady And The Tramp"" is the reason why I'm the person I am and I defend it with every fiber and bone in my body, but this is still decent. In terms of Disney's mediocre live action output, this film is definitely not one of the dogs.RATING: 6/10",Lady and the Tramp

Even the change to a new female character annoys me. There's elements cut out that we're such a joy in the original. Lady seems less dimensional or emotional in this version and I feel like the attempt to develop Tramp's character and backstory is forced.

186,Saint_Kanoa,Disappointing,2,15 November 2019,"Let me just start with the fact that I think this is an enjoyable movie for kids. But as far as Disney live action movies go, this is the worst one yet.The CGI animation had some flaws but unfortunately that isn't the worst thing about this movie. It really didn't get me into it. Though the story line is pretty much the same as the original, with a few extra scenes. I wasn't really happy about some of the choices they made for this adaption, mostly that Jock is suddenly a girl... like why would you change an entire character.I do think the voice actors did a great job, especially Justin Theroux. I personally would have chosen a different 'voice' for Lady but Tessa Thompson did okay. Also 1 star is for Sam Elliott because... well it's Sam Elliott and his amazing voice.The rest of the movie is just flat. I just don't feel any emotion with the characters and even my girlfriend, who likes everything with cats and dogs, didn't care much about the characters. The classic spaghetti eating scene was truly emotionless and disappointing, but it was the best scene of the movie... so that's a shame.I don't really care if something is PC but this movie made it a little too much, which in turn made me feel like it's being jotted down my throat.In conclusion I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Not even if you want to compare it to the original cartoon. I hope Disney won't destroy any other (live action) remakes like they've done with this one and Aladdin. Please ask Jon Favreau to make the next live action again. Or at least learn from him",Lady and the Tramp
187,mcdaidn,A classic Disney remake that delivers exactly what you'd expect,7,8 March 2021,"I've really enjoyed some of the recent live-action Disney remakes and Lady and the Tramp was no different. What surprised me whilst watching was how much I found myself actually empathising with the dogs and considering the world from their perspective! This was an aspect I found particularly impressive. It doesn't quite reach Pixar's level in this respect, who's films always seem to always have you identifying with characters to an extent you didn't know was possible, no matter if they're toys or even a 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter', but it still does a brilliant job.
Thompson and Theroux are excellent in believably humanizing the titular characters but the standout performance for me came from Sam Elliott. His iconic voice lends itself perfectly to the supporting character of Trusty, with his deadpan delivery of some golden one liners being a real highlight. The CGI, with dogs talking, felt a little jarring at first but it didn't take long to forget about this which is further testament to the production's achievement in humanizing a leading cast of predominantly dogs. The main storyline is of course very well known so there were never going to be many surprises here but even down to the small details this film didn't stray from the well trodden path it takes. While not necessarily a bad thing, a few minor touches to freshen up this remake a little wouldn't have gone amiss.

Completely ignores it as they change the races of damn near everyone in the movie. It's probably the least diverse movie I've ever seen.....it shouldn't be allowed anywhere near children, much less adults. It's just another way to control black people: control their story and you control them in general. This movie attempts to do that and frankly it succeeds at that.Unfortunately it doesn't succeed in entertaining anybody, and the story....yeah it's butchered.

This definitely isn't an awful movie. The opening is actually pretty lovely, and overall the movie has a lot of nice aesthetic to it throughout. The few songs are honestly fine. Not really cringy or anything, they don't waste time on these really. The CGI of the dogs is kind of hit or miss. Some scenes it's actually pretty believable and looks great, others it can be a bit wonky. But the movie also lacks what visual luster an animated film brings, not to mention that this version is a bit longer than the animated, so the movie ends up feeling a bit laggy and drawn out.

The Bella Notte scene, along with the CGI for the animals was very well done and I was happy with that at least. But all in all, the movie was really just catering to a modern mindset. Too many changes were made just so Disney could say they're not blind to representation, diversity or the power of women.I mean, they made Darling black for goodness sake. I'm not against biracial couples or people of color whatsoever (I am one myself), but in that time period, a biracial couple was unheard of. If anything, she would have been a maid. Then, they made Jock a girl. Really feminists? Now every other male role needs to be filled in by a female just so they don't feel left out?Don't even get me started on the songs. Every one, (besides Bella Notte) was completely rushed through and altered to the core. And last but not least, Lady's personality was butchered. The OG Lady was definitely posh, but she was also soft spoken and innocent. But now? She's overconfident and snobby.

Some of the scenes also looked incomplete. The cats looked incredibly fake and their new song was somehow both cringy and forgettable.

I've given up comparing these remakes to the old classics. If you do that, you're going to be disappointed. It's a completely different movie, but that doesn't mean it's bad! I've read some of the reviews for this movie and yes, some of the songs have changed, but the new style fits the time period and doesn't botch the old classics. Example: ""Bella Notte"" was sung beautifully and ""He's a Tramp"" was sassy and adorable. So yes, you may be disappointed that there isn't a racially insensitive Siamese cat song, the Scottish dog's gender has changed, and there's an interracial couple when it may not be ""historically accurate"". None of those things are bad, just different. Bottom line, the movie makes me smile, and laugh, and cry, and enjoy every moment of the story of two dogs from different worlds who make a world of their own. If you're watching a movie about a story like that anyway why are you trying to poke holes in it with things that ""aren't historically accurate"" or ""different from the original""?

Completely gutless, uninspired, soulless, bland, and ultimately forgettable retelling of a classic. Almost every significant plot change from the original was for the worse, although it's all so minor all it does is make this version more boring.And that's what kills this film the most. Nothing about it is offensively bad, it's just... mind numbingly boring. It feels like nothing matters. The editing is done in some peculiar way that I felt no attachment to any shot or scene at all. Everything floated by for an indeterminable amount of time until it ended. There was an attempt at drama and character development but it all just feels so... hollow.If this was ridiculously atrocious, maybe I could get enjoyment out of being mad about it. Or maybe if it was so bad it's good, I could laugh at it. Instead what happened was I sat and watched a screen with no change in emotion or thinking until it ended. It wasted my time. I got no enjoyment, not even the unintended kind. Nothing about it stands out aside from how milquetoast it all is.All in all, this isn't worth anyone's time. I can barely think of anything redeemable about this film. The performances are just average at best, the visuals are average at best, the music is average at best, and it all combines into being useless nothingness that will be lost to time.P.S., if your main gripe with this movie is its use of actors of different races and genders from that of the original, you might just be prejudiced.

The cats just get out the basket and randomly decide to trash the place, instead of going looking for baby's milk in the original, which is why the place gets trashed as Lady tries to stop them - so this whole sequence just had no purpose), the Beaver is replaced by a beaver statue and its not even clear how ""his"" role helps get the muzzle off... the story is disjointed as the whole end rat scene happens after Aunt Sarah is long gone, Trusty doesnt get hurt by the cart, Tramp does, and Lady and the Tramp dont even have babies at the end!! instead, female Jock's owner has bought Lab and staffie pups. WTF? It does kinda follow the story but the ONLY bit i felt was at all faithful to the original was the meatball scene. That was done very well.
otherwise, just a confused, annoyingly PC disappointment. Like other reviewers I am NOT racist, but the interracial couple and mix of other races shown in other characters was just distracting bearing in mind its 1900's America.

I must say, however, with this ""Lady and the Tramp"" remake I have been pleasantly surprised. I absolutely love it! While it is true that it doesn't stick 100% to the original, it has captured all the key elements and feelings of the animated version. I LOVE the spaghetti scene and the time that Lady and Tramp spend together after the whole muzzle fiasco.Something I really enjoyed about this version is the fact that Lady is a bit more self-assured. She teases Tramp, which I thoroughly enjoyed watching. I also liked getting a bit more about Tramp's history and wanted to cheer when Darling stood up to the evil, obsessed lunatic-of-a-dog-catcher and told him that Tramp had a home with them.While it's true that there are some differences between the original and the remake, IMHO both versions are absolutely wonderful.",Lady and the Tramp

However, I have to agree with some of the other criticisms of the movie. Based on the time in which they set the film, is kinda hard to believe that Jim Dear and Darling would've lived in such a nice house and had so many friends come over for the baby shower. Interracial couples just weren't a thing really in the early 1900s. They just weren't. Not in places where there were riverboats. And maybe it was because I was a kid when I saw the movie The first time, but I never realized that the Siamese cat's song was rude or offensive, but I'm also not Asian so that might contribute to it too. It would've been nice if they'd tried to fix the lyrics for the song rather than scrap it altogether. The thing they replaced it with, and what was UP with the animation of those cats, it was just weird, was unimpressive. I was also confused by their making Jock a girl, though I always thought it was spelled Jaques, I have no problem with it on the whole, it was just an ""oh, I guess he's a girl now, ok."" But what happened to Beaver?!Otherwise, still a good movie. I enjoyed it. But I think I'll be sticking to my original animated version whenever I get the urge to watch Lady and the Tramp.",Lady and the Tramp

If they want to actually impact they cultural changes, they should have updated the film to modern times to not reduce the effect of past prejudice. I'm of Jewish decent and this film is like recreating a 1940's German film into a Jewish comedy.The director and producers should be ashamed, no wonder they did not release this in the theaters an only chose to release this on Disney+. I hope Disney learns to value diversity in the right way and not choosing to rewrite history based on their hopeful expectations, if that is the case only produce futuristic films.",Lady and the Tramp

Not worth the watch. So disappointed.",Lady and the Tramp
226,stjcurwen,NICE BUT OFF LINE AN POOR,6,26 March 2020,After watch Lady & Tramp original and comparing to too. A lot of characters voices an role been changed which threw me an a lot of story been cut out. This a poor display of a remake when you look at others like the recent lion king. The overall feel was too crowded in places and missing out original part of the story does make a impact on anybody watching. The zoo would of been great best seen in film on the original but this remake was too short as sweet. Nice feel for new viewers but looks rushed for a big pocket maker. If they kept to script an just adapted it a bit then would of be ideal but changing jock to a female made me almost switch off as his role was great in the original. Even Tony's the two didn't look nothing like from the original. So much left out. The voice sync was out in places I noticed. Overall its good a watch but not one many will rush to see again.,Lady and the Tramp

First of all, as many people say, they reflect a society that does not reflect the truth about the time where the story develops. On the other hand, they changed some characters.

Also it's a little different from the original movie but loved how they added the original storyline in this new one. It's a lovely movie! I hope they also will make the lady and the tramp 2.

The movie line wavered in a horrible way. Inaccurate timeline glitches. Ex. How could the nursery be in pink when ultrasounds weren't even invented yet?! After the baby is born the Darlings Show Lady she is still included. Here it is like Disney wants people to think if you have a baby you have to ditch your dog.

It seems that most people want to complain about the diversity of cast, but honestly folks, its a movie about talking dogs; not a documentary of the times.
The CGI of the dogs talking is dodgy at best, sometimes it works, sometimes it looks horrible. It feels like a high school skill level play being acted with stilted, self-conscious, fringe thespians. Most of the time the dogs are just standing in place, mouthing their inner humans' voices, which is not all that engaging for the viewers. Standing on its own it is a perfectly innocent piece of fluff that is again, fine.

But when lady realizes that she won't be number one priority it is just not very realistic even if we went back to a stricter time Like the movie is set. For example when she barked when she entered the babies room to make yourself known like ""by the way guys I'm here"" they mediately scolded her and threw her out which I don't feel like that's how it would happen.Overall this film was exceptional. Sam Elliot as Dusty was one of my favorite parts of a movie and I love the casting for the father as it seem to fit just so well with the time period.But overall the movie was just absurdly beautiful my favorite example was when during the middle of a transition you were looking down the street and you saw these old-school street lamps and old-school architecture but my favorite part of this example is they had two beautiful small blue butterflies fly around almost dancing.

The cats were terrible CGI. I was quite anxious to see this movie, as I loved the original. If the casting had reflected the original, it would have been a MUCH better movie. If it is going to be a revisionist view, why not have nicer, newer cars? Why not match todays clothing styles?

Maybe it's because she had a rough time living in the streets before we rescued her from the shelter and it brought back memories.Anyway, we had to stop watching it, but I was amazed at the CGI work so far.

I have no problem with showing interracial couples on tv, it's great. But when you're in the early 1900's?? No. Also, Lady was very jarring.

How about you put your efforts into actually making sure the movie is historically accurate (interracial marriage - which I'm in by the way) and true to the original characters (Siamese cats and Scotty). You can't even stand the idea of leaving an actual breed of cat in the movie? You were focused so hard on PC'ing this movie where it wasn't needed that I guess you lost your vision because the CGI was horrible. That church in the intro? Looked like a block from minecraft.

It takes a bit to get used to the animated dogs eyes and mouths, but with the cgi seamlessly blended into the trained dogs bodies, it's a very impressive effect. The remake gave a refreshing insight into the lives of the humans surrounding the dogs as well as developing the dogs characters themselves.

Not one had a kind word.Most were baffled as to how Disney could screw this up from story to poor CGI. We were relieved this would not be going into theaters.Some of us were asked to stay as the 90% of the audience was dismissed. It got even worse. You had tweens extremely upset over how this did not match up to the original, was quite eye opening.As we exited, the director & production team were sitting in the back. As we exited past them, they did not make eye contact and look absolutely dejected.I am sorry, Walt would never approve of 1/100th of what 21st Disney is doing now by enabling so many social ills and bowing to communist markets.Real pity, were huge Disney fans.",Lady and the Tramp

257,nasimmons-59034,Taking political correctness too far,2,14 February 2020,"Lady and the Tramp is my favorite Disney movie of all time. My wife and I watch it every year on valentine's day. This year we decided to watch the remake, and wow I was so disappointed. So many changes were made, almost all for the sake of political correctness. Now as a disclaimer, I am not racist. I have friends of many different races.
In the remake, Jim is white and Darling is black. The doctor who delivers the baby is asian. There are black people mixed in with white people everywhere. Normally, I would have no problem with this. The problem comes in with the fact the movie takes place in the early 1900s in the southeast United States. Check your history books. You would never see an interracial couple, a non white doctor, blacks and whites being neighbors. Racism was big, and you can't change that. Keep this stuff historically accurate. They changed the siamese cats into a different breed, and got rid of the 'we are siamese' song because of some sort of 'racial stereotype'. Hello Disney, siamese cats aren't a 'racist' cat, they're a real breed.
The way they treated Lady was terrible. They keep her away from the baby until AFTER aunt Sarah leaves. The rat doesn't even attack until way after she leaves as well.
The only reason I didn't give this 1 star was because my favorite scene in the original, the date at Tony's, was spot on.
I would honestly not reccomend this movie to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you have seen the original.",Lady and the Tramp

I recommend going in to watch this movie with fresh eyes because it's very well made and very entertaining. My kids thought it was funny and heartwarming. Keep in mind this is a kids movie that has some deep underlying messages, as long as you keep an open mind you can see.For all of the people harping on the fact that this movie portrays racial equality and harmony in the early 1900s, you need to get over your prejudices. Ask yourself would this movie be soooo much better if all the people were white or if this was a shot for shot remake? I don't think so. I like the fact that my kids got to see people of different races in the movie because I'm hoping for them it normalizes seeing just people and not being surprised when there's a biracial couple on screen. It's nice to see an imagined better world than the current divisive world we live in.As far as it being not realistic, it's a MOVIE it is not a documentary or historical drama.

263,Elflon,Why so many unnecessary changes?,3,31 March 2020,"Perhaps the writers and director of the live action Lady and the Tramp wanted to put their own spin on things, or perhaps they were frightened of upsetting people.Whatever the reasoning, they left out some of the most classic and memorable scenes and songs from the original movie, and I was so disappointed.I don't particularly mind that they made Darling black, even though it was set in 1909, when interracial marriage was illegal. I was able to overlook this historical inaccuracy.However, what was the reasoning behind getting rid of the Siamese cats? If it was OK to have a Scottish terrier with a Scottish accent, why not Siamese cats with Thai accents? Ok - perhaps they didn't need to make them buck-toothed - but changing their breed altogether, and getting rid of the classic 'We are Siamese' song, was just so disappointing and unnecessary.On the subject of Jock, or ""Jacqueline"", WHY gender-swap him? It didn't add anything to the story, and they took away the very meaningful scene when Jock 'proposed' to Lady in order to give her somewhere safe to live.But to be honest, the thing that disappointed me most of all was that Lady and the Tramp never ended up having any puppies. That final scene with the puppies was my absolute favourite part of the original film - why remove it? The only reason I could think of is because they didn't want to promote the breeding of dogs - but this was set in 1909 - people would not have had their pets spayed and neutered back then.",Lady and the Tramp

However, New Orleans in the early 1900s was one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Many people from the creole population (a mix of European and black peoples - especially French/black), we're frequently Part of the social elite. Mixed marriages, such as the one portrayed in this updated release, were not uncommon at this time and location.Many of the reviews here are making claims that Disney is being ""PC."" Actually, they're being accurate to the reality of the time and location. However, based upon these reviews, I guess many Americans don't know the facts about this wonderful city and still have a lot of work left to do when it comes to racial acceptance.Thank you Disney!

I am getting ever so slightly annoyed that everything on tv has to be PC!

That's fine, it's not a historical drama. But NONE of the characters drew you in and made you care. Lady wasn't sweet, she was brassy. Tramp wasn't scrappy and likeable, he was just blah. The animation was off too. There were some points when it was rough to watch. Also, the voices- I felt like most of the voices didn't match the characters. The original tramp had a confidence and a swagger to his voice that goes with the character, this one just sounded worn out and unconvincing.",Lady and the Tramp

Although not likely one that would've done well in theaters, it was a good one to watch at home. The actors doing the animal voices were overall much better than the actual human performances in this movie, but this wasn't such a bad thing since the animals were the movie's main focus. The one thing that did kind of bug me throughout the movie, was that while they changed the original male character Jock (black scottie), into a female who hilariously wears multiple human dresses; it was overtly obvious when viewed from the side, this scottie was quite definitely a male dog. It was just one of those odd things that stuck out so much, I couldn't help but notice, & it was distracting.

Jock was a girl WTF?! And the Siamese cats are gone. Most of my favorite scenes and lines were removed or changed completely. The only classic scene that is somewhat similar is the spaghetti scene.

I loved that particular scene in the original.I understand that they couldn't use that same song word for word because of all the drama around.mocking Asians in it but they could've modified it less than they did now. They didn't even use the Siamese cats! They could've done that and modified the lyrics to fit the time we are living in now, couldn't they?!Also, i'm all for having different colored actors and actresses but a mixed race couple in a time where it was almost unthinkable to actually be in a mixed race relationship? No, that's just wrong. Don't have colored actors and acrtresses in a movie where it's not historically accurate.Other than that, well, i didn't finish the movie.

Like the cats and peg's song.There are more people of color than white folks in this version which is so amazing to see.The dog catcher was fun obsessed character. The tramp had a clearer motivation. Lady felt more rounded out.The only part that made no sense was Tony's. You're restaurant is the middle of a rush and you have time to serenade a dog's date? How do you have a business??The cgi did what lion king tried to do. In my opinion, it succeeds a lot better than lion king marrying cgi with live action. I know that's not what lion king was trying to do but I feel that this hits the notes lion king tried to hit.The only time I feel the cgi fails is with peg. She ends up looking like an animatronic of a dog instead of an actual dog. Which is a shame because it's Janelle Monae.Tessa Thompson is amazing. Justin is great.

Now if they wanted to change the period to the 2000s, then sure! But this obsession for political correctness needs to make the political correctness of its era.

285,elissa-duffy25,The good and the bad,7,16 November 2019,"SPOILER WARNING!!!!!
I think that for the most part everybody agrees that we all appreciate when these movies are made into live and CGI, we want it to be nearly an exact remake of the original, right? Minor changes, sure, but not ones that change the story.In the half of the movie, the acting was lacking big time. The actress who played Darling was the worst, but was ok/good in the second half. Jim Dear was better, and consistent throughout. Yvette Brown, who can do no wrong in my eyes, played Aunt Sarah. I was disappointed that they did not use her amazing acting skills to better use as the villain in this movie. She was a relatively minor role. The dog catcher, who was 100% a background character in the animated version is now a primary character and the crazy villain.Pros: CGI was top notch. They did SUCH a good job. They perfected dog mannerisms perfectly, from how they walk, to the slight eye, ear, and mouth micro movements dogs make. Bravo. The spaghetti scene, UGH, it was so good. So. Good. Brought back the little kid nostalgia for sure. Tramp's story, so sad. The rat/bedroom scene was VERY well done!If you want to know the changes they made that I did not like, and that I think most people would say ""what the heck"" to (at least initially), here they are:Jaque/Jock, the Scottish terrier, is now a girl. Ugh. That was unnecessary. We all like the cute old man, but the female version was just as cute, and eventually makes you forget that he's supposed to be a boy.Aunt Sarah is Darling's aunt now, not Jim Dear's.The dog catcher is the villain now, instead of a background character doing his job. He's crazy now, which provides some comedy, but still.They did not have Lady meet the baby and bond with her prior to Jim Dear and Darling's trip.Jim Dear and Darling TAKE THE BABY WITH THEM instead of leaving the baby with Aunt Sarah. They pick Lady up from the pound, instead of Aunt Sarah. So, obviously, this means that Jim Dear and Darling come back before the rat/bedroom incident. This defeats the purpose of showing Aunt Sarah how Lady is a loyal dog through and through to her family (since Aunt Sara can't stand her), and that Tramp is a good dog too. They changed the story to prove a point about Tramp to the dog catcher instead, since he's the crazy villain and a primary character now.Lady and the Tramp don't have puppies in the end. Instead, the neighbor adopts two puppies, and that's the puppy fix in the movie",Lady and the Tramp
286,Damian-wesseloo,Good but the original is better,7,8 January 2020,The movie itself is pretty good. The original was one of my favourite childhood movies and watched it multiple times.Things that people are saying are true. They changed a lot for the public agenda...if this does not matter to you then you will like it. If you care a lot about this topic and feel like hollywood should stop this nonsense then you should probably skip this movie.Dogs are beautifully done and i dont mind that the actors are not blockbuster material at all because they are not important to the story.The only thing that bothered me is that the emotional parts of this movie do not feel as strong as in the animated version and they did do some things differently to the original.

Did the writers, producers, directors etc. not see how well Jon Favereu did with The Lion King? The ones behind the making of this film basically throughout most of the original Lady and the Tramp script to favor a supposedly 'triggered' audience. Did they not realize they would be alienating their core audience who either grew up watching the original or knew someone who did? In case someone out there says I'm not woke or that I'm racist, I have no problem with interracial couples. I just don't like people rewriting history. This was supposed to be early 1900s US and a couple like that not only did not exist, it was illegal. I would have just updated the time of the movie to modern day or near it. I also do not condone making fun of other races, which is not what the Siamese cats of the original we're doing. They were, to me, just mischievous cats. So it wasn't necessary to take that out. Also, I have no problem replacing characters with the opposite gender. But when the original story requires it, as with Jock who makes the proposal to marry Lady to give her a good home, then do not change the gender. Finally and most importantly, they through out some of the best scenes and music sequences for reasons I cannot understand.

Disney possibly trying to rewrite history and more I think about that's not cool. Bigger flaws of the film however, the songs words were changed, they made Jock a girl dog which was just weird, frustratingly the tramp nicknames Lady ""kid"" instead of ""pigeon"" and lastly the ""we are Siamese"" song an epic classic wasn't even sung the cats had a dreadful new song instead. The set up of old england was very good and Tony's scene put a smile of my face and so did the trusty smell scene, animation of dogs talking and their overall characteristics was great too. Like I said had I not seen and loved the original I'd probably rate higher but too much of the original good stuff was changed or removed.

Ummm... dogs talking, or Italian restaurants setting a table and singing to two dogs on a date. Pretty sure nobodies upset over that. Honestly, I don't understand. This is a kids movie so I'm actually pretty stoked they took out the Siamese song, as well as tramp being a ""play boy"". I don't see anyone complaining about tramp not being promiscuous . I want my daughter to see interracial marriage as normal, because it is. And I loved the actress, her voice was beautiful. The cgi was a little wonky at times but not enough to take me out of the movie and the town was beautiful. All in all, another wonderful Disney movie I got to enjoy with my daughter. Don't listen to the negative reviews because you really will miss out on a good movie.",Lady and the Tramp

327,paulhook-99586,Woke. As you'd expect these days,1,19 February 2021,"The old animated film is so much better. Such a shame the creators had to go down the 'woke' route with this. In doing so, it has lost it's magic and the opportunity for a nostalgic live action reenactment of the 1955 classic.",Lady and the Tramp
328,heathermarsteller,Original voices were soothing and iconic..should not have changed them so drastically,1,16 November 2019,"It is a shame and a HUGE mistake for Disney to NOT realize how comforting, soothing, and iconic the original voices from Lady and Tramp effected their audiences. For Disney to completely change the sound, pitch, and attitude of so many main characters in this re-make movie of Lady and the Tramp has ruined it for me. Peggy Lee and Barbara Luddy are legendary for Disney and their iconic voices should have been replicated as close as possible. Disney should have done them the same respect as they did with the male leads in the film and matched the legendary characters' voices. Disney have done a great disservice to this film and to the new actors/actresses who tried to remake these roles that they could not replicate. Shame on you Disney. Make new movies with new lead characters who can establish themselves as original...and STOP try to redefine and ruin the classics.",Lady and the Tramp
