0,MartinHafer,"As long as you aren't expecting to see ""The 47 Ronin"", you might enjoy this film.",3,29 April 2014,"Why remake a CLASSIC Japanese story and have so little respect for the source material?!If I had been told that this film was NOT a version of the classic story, ""The 47 Ronin"", and it had some other title, I probably would have enjoyed it very much. But considering that the original story is based on real events and has been the subject of many plays and movies, I have no idea why the filmmakers had such disregard for the source material. Watching the 2013 version is akin to watching a film about the Revolutionary War...and some of the soldiers are aliens! And, I am pretty sure this sort of bizarre storytelling must have offended many of the Japanese who saw it because they expected the traditional story and not this bizarre fantasy film. This story is a nationally treasured one--and such a ridiculous fantasy version simply makes no sense. It's obvious that although MOST of the cast is Japanese, the filmmakers knew little or cared to know little about their culture and history. There are many ridiculous story points. The obvious one, if you know Japanese history, is having Keanu Reeves in the film at all. Starting in the 17th century, foreigners were banned from Japan. Other than a tiny trading island, Dejima, a foreigner would face the death penalty for going to Japan until the time of the American visits to Japan in the mid-19th century. So, the idea of a non-Japanese samurai is just ridiculous. But even more ridiculous are witches who can turn themselves into foxes and dragons, a MASSIVE warrior who is referred to as a 'Lovecraftian' samurai on IMDb (it's just so silly--you'd have to see it to believe this almost 8 foot tall 'thing'), ENORMOUS mythical creatures and more. Had the film been a fantasy film based on some Japanese mythology (such as the Kitsune which could change shape from fox to whatever) then it would have been fun and pure escapism. But, as a retired history teacher and lover of Japanese films, I find this entire production to be an abomination. It looks nice but has zero regard for the actual inspirational story of the 47 Ronin who gave up their lives for the sake of honor. It's really sad to see Hollywood handling Japanese culture and history so casually.",47 Ronin
1,TheLittleSongbird,Very poor film though not entirely dishonourable,2,14 August 2016,"Being very fond of the fantasy genre, this reviewer was expecting '47 Ronin', also based on a great real story, to be much better than it was.'47 Ronin' is not entirely dishonourable. It does feature some stunning visuals, the film is beautifully photographed, incredibly handsomely mounted and the set and costume designs are spellbinding. The music score is ethereal and rousing, and although the acting was bad on the whole there was one good performance and that was the tremendously dignified one of Hiroyuki Sanada.Not all the visual aspects come off well. The editing is all over the place, sometimes chaotic and too busy, providing a choppy effect to the storytelling and some incompleteness in the continuity. The special effects also look like the makers ran out of budget. Even for a fledgling director, Carl Rinsch's lack of experience comes through loud and clear with some lack of visual finesse and an inability to allow the film to come to life.Of the acting, only Sanada is good. Keanu Reeves is very wooden and completely out of place with a character and back-story that feel as though they were incorporated as an afterthought. Ko Shibasaki looks uncomfortable, and while Rinko Kikuchi can be a bright spot she isn't here, here she overacts dreadfully in a role more at home in an over-the-top pantomime production. It was a laudable idea using real Japanese actors, and some are very talented, but they don't look comfortable and line delivery is stilted.To be fair though, the writing badly works against them and leaves them severely stranded, everything sounding awkward, clunky and preposterously pithy. How anybody involved was able to take anything coming out the actors' mouths seriously is anybody's guess. The characters are basically every genre stereotype and cliché in existence, which may not have been a problem if they were interesting but they are cardboard and mannequin-like instead.Regarding the story, it starts off in a very pedestrian fashion and sadly never comes to life or gains momentum. It never excites, entertains or moves, instead feeling tedious and long-winded with some very stupid elements that makes the film impossible to take at face value or take it for what it is. Action is too little, and when it does feature it's overblown and like a cartoon.In conclusion, has a few components that saves it from being a complete disaster but very poor. 2/10 Bethany Cox",47 Ronin
2,Leofwine_draca,Classic story with added 'Harry Potter fantasy action',4,13 August 2016,"47 RONIN tells the famous story about vengeful ex-samurai seeking revenge for their former master and of course is one of the most famous true life events in the whole of Japanese history. This big bucks Hollywood adaptation of the tale takes the basic facts and moulds them into an expensive, expansive fantasy film. If you're looking for somebody to blame for what might be termed a travesty, go no further than Universal, who apparently viewed the first cut and told the director to add more 'Harry Potter style fantasy sequences'.Because Harry Potter-style action is just what this film needs, of course. Thus 47 RONIN is full of incessantly poor CGI action spectacle that reminded me a little of THE EMPEROR AND THE WHITE SNAKE, a similarly silly production made by the Chinese. Take out the fantasy and you have a moderately interesting revenge story; leave it in and you get a ridiculously overblown story with effects that have already dated in just the few years since the film was released.The cast is the most interesting thing about the production. Keanu Reeves, no stranger to the wiles of Asian cinema, takes on the same role as Tom Cruise in THE LAST SAMURAI, acting as the western audience's way into the tale. It's not one of his better performances. Thankfully, the casting director has gone out of their way to include genuine Japanese talent, including Masayoshi Haneda (MEMORIES OF MATSUKO), Tadanobu Asano (TOKYO ZOMBIE), Ko Shibasaki (ONE MISSED CALL), Min Tanaka (THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI), and of course the great and immortal Hiroyuki Sanada, one of my favourite Japanese actors. All give solid performances, and the main casting problem lies with Rinko Kikuchi (PACIFIC RIM), whose acting as the evil witch is pantomime-style over the top.47 RONIN does have plenty of action and spectacle to recommend it, but even scenes of the characters crossing a wild landscape are reminiscent of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. The action scenes are quite good and I liked the attempts to bring certain creatures from Japanese mythology to the screen, even if they're not always successful. It was also a delight to see Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa NOT playing a villain for a change. In the end, though, this is another Hollywood bastardisation of an eastern fable, and as such it can't be forgiven easily for its mistakes.",47 Ronin
3,SnoopyStyle,Stiff writing saps energy from movie,5,25 October 2014,"Ronins are former samurai who failed their masters and live in shame. Kai is a mysterious half-breed who some believe to be a demon. Lord Asano of Ako saved him and allowed him to live with them. He falls in love with Asano's daughter Mika. Years later, rival Lord Kira of Nagato wants Ako for himself. He tries to assassinate Lord Asano with a demonic beast which Kai (Keanu Reeves) is able to kill. He has a witch in his entourage. Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi visits Lord Asano. Kai suspects the witch but he is dismissed by Oishi. Kai is forced into a tournament by witchcraft and beaten for not being a samurai. Then witchcraft disturbs Lord Asano's mind into hurting Lord Kira. Lord Asano is allowed to commit seppuku. Oishi finally realizes the witchcraft of Lord Kira. The Shogun then gives Ako and Mika to Lord Kira while branding Oishi and his men Ronin. The wedding is set in one year. Oishi is imprisoned and Kai is sold into slavery.The story is long and winding and not in a good way. The movie has slow pacing. The story is stiff. The dialog is really stiff too. The Japanese actors doing English in a stiff manner is not a good thing and they add in Keanu Reeves. There are some visual style to the movie. Unknown director Carl Rinsch is unable to bring life into this story. The closest to life is the chubby fat samurai. It's just written without thought of making a compelling story. And the monotone speaking voices don't make it any better.",47 Ronin
4,Prismark10,Samurai and Monsters,5,10 April 2014,Supernatural mixed with Samurai plus a shape-shifting witch and monsters makes for an intriguing combination with lush footage of Japan.Keanu Reeves is a half breed Japanese who is taken in by a kindly feudal warlord and is attracted to his daughter. He is faithful to the family even though the other Samurai treat him with disdain.However a rival warlord uses witchcraft to usurp him making Keanu an outcast and the other Samurais of the household become ronin's.These fallen group of former samurais band together to gain revenge and save their former master's daughter in marrying the rival warlord that is designed to unite both factions.This is a revenge and love story whilst touching upon Japanese tradition of honour and redemption. Reeves is rather subdued here which does not serve the story too well. The monsters and mayhem work well with good use of location shooting in Japan but the film just never hits full throttle and the recent Wolverine film that was also shot in Japan rather stole its thunder.The ending sits uneasily if you are not Japanese especially as that part of the story is based on true life events.,47 Ronin
5,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Fantasy,7,14 June 2014,"In Ako, Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) and his samurai Ôishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) are hunting in the forest and they find a half-breed boy. Lord Asano brings him to Ako and the boy that is named Kai is raised with his daughter Mika. Years later, Mika (Kô Shibasaki) and Kai (Keanu Reeves) are secretly in love with each other. Lord Asano welcomes the Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and the Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) at home. However, Kira's Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) casts a spell on Lord Asano and he tries to kill Kira. The Shogun sentences Lord Asano to death and offers the option of committing Harakiri to die with honor.

One year later, Ôishi is released from the imprisonment and he plots a scheme to revenge Lord Asano with Kai and the other ronin.""47 Ronin"" is an entertaining fantasy based on the classic Japanese story. Despite the Western behaviors and feelings of the ronin and Mika, the movie is not bad as indicated in many reviews. Actually I have had a nice surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""47 Ronins"" (""47 Ronin"")",47 Ronin
6,kosmasp,Not anime(ted),5,5 August 2014,"Whatever you think of the actor Keanu Reeves, I wouldn't lay any blame on him for this movie. While there might have been more charismatic actors to play the main role, he had a tough time being the only ""Westerner"" in an all Asian cast. The problem being though, that even though they (producers, filmmakers) tried to keep this close to the original material, they didn't really achieve that.While I haven't seen the other two Japanese movies that were based on the ""47 Ronin"" story (there is also a Manga adaptation of it), this struggles keeping the Asian sensibility intact but make it accessible to Western audiences. As mentioned it fails doing so. Actually gloriously fails to do so. You either will like the ""Special Effects"" fest towards the end or think it's completely bananas. Whatever the case, the story is too cliché (good vs. evil) and there are not many redeeming factors. If you can overlook those, you can have some fun though ... not much, but enough to make it almost decent",47 Ronin
7,classicsoncall,"""When a crime does unpunished, the world is unbalanced.""",7,7 August 2019,"For a film dealing with forty seven ronin, there's very little in the way of martial arts action in the story. The problem I have is with the blind obedience the various provinces had to honor Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) with. To my mind, the Asano Clan did the right thing in avenging the death of their Lord (Min Tanaka), but with one god-like authority calling the shots without question, the possibility that he might have been wrong is dealt with as a moot point. I also couldn't understand why the Nagato Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) made herself subservient to Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano). As powerful as she was in her various guises, she didn't need to go to all that trouble to get her way, she could have stepped right over Kira as need be. Though Kianu Reeves is the principal character Kai, a half-breed warrior raised by the Asano Clan, it seems at times that the real hero of the story is Hiroyuki Sanada's Oishi as point man for the Asano's. It's Oishi who rises to the occasion to put away Lord Kira, while Kai (Reeves) battles the dragon-witch in her final guise. I know the point of the story is honor and tradition, but what would have happened if all the Samurai at the end of the picture decided they weren't going to follow the Shogun's order to commit seppuku? I don't think I would have liked those odds if I was in his shoes.",47 Ronin
8,jboothmillard,47 Ronin,4,14 July 2019,"I saw one or two posters for this film during its release in cinemas, and then on DVD, I had my guesses what it was going to be about, and I was definitely up for watching it. Basically, in late medieval Japan (18th century), half-Japanese, half-English outcast Kai (Keanu Reeves) was found in the forest as a young boy by Lord Asano of Ako (Min Tanaka) and his samurai Ôishi while they were hunting. He is raised and trained to become a samurai, despite the other warriors scorning him for his mixed ancestry. Over the years, Kai and the Lord's daughter Mika (Ko Shibasaki) grow up, and eventually they secretly fall in love. Lord Asano is visited by the Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and the Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano), and they plan to hold a tournament. During the night however, Lord Asano is bewitched into hurting Lord Kira, and is punished into committing seppuku by the Shogun. Ôishi and his samurais become Ronin (samurai without masters), he is arrested, and Kai is sold as a slave in another village. One year later, Ôishi is released from the imprisonment and he plots a scheme to revenge Lord Asano with Kai and the other Ronin. What follows is a battle against monstrous and magical enemies as they seek to reclaim their former status. Also starring Jin Akanishi as Chikara, Masayoshi Haneda as Yasuno, Hiroshi Sogabe as Hazama, and Rick Genest (aka Zombie Boy, who famously appeared in the Lady Gaga - ""Born This Way"" music video) as Foreman. Reeves is reasonable as the leafing hero who helps his clan go against whatever enemy they face, all the Asian actors are made to speak English, it might have been more interesting if it was in foreign language with subtitles. I could follow the plot of forty-seven warriors being banished and avenging their master, but almost everything else I couldn't quite, I just went along with it, monsters appearing for whatever reason, and only the fights and special effects kept it going, nothing really original, a half-and-half period fantasy action adventure. Okay!",47 Ronin
9,Tweekums,A tale of vengeance in feudal Japan,8,23 September 2019,"As this film opens Kai, a young 'half-breed' is found in the forest by Lord Asano Naganori and his samurai. He is taken in by the lord but is never really accepted by his samurai. The years pass and the shogun visits the province; during the visit Asano is tricked in to attacking Lord Kira, the shogun's master of ceremonies. For doing this he is forced to commit seppuku; his lands are given to Lord Kira, who after a year will now marry Asano's daughter; and his now masterless samurai are declared ronin and forced to leave the province. The most senior of his samurai, Oishi, is jailed in a pit for a year. Upon his release Oishi seeks out Kai and then the other samurai. They plot to get their revenge before Kira marries.I enjoyed this film far more than I expected. It effectively mixes a story (loosely) inspired by real events and supernatural elements of Japanese folklore. These includes a shapeshifting fox-woman, tengu and a Kirin. The key characters are introduced well and the story moves at a good pace with plenty of action throughout and a fine climactic battle. Many scenes rely on CGI and these are pretty good, making it easy to believe in the various supernatural goings-on. The cast is decent, Keanu Reeves is solid as Kai, a fictional character added to the story for the film, is the only western actor in a significant role; all of the Japanese characters are played by Japanese actors who do surprisingly well given that their characters are speaking in English not their native tongue. It probably helps if you know a little bit about Japanese folklore but I don't think it would be too much of a problem if you don't. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of action with a supernatural twist.",47 Ronin

11,BA_Harrison,"A massive flop, and deservedly so.",3,7 January 2016,"A group of ronin are joined by half-cast warrior Kai (Keanu Reeves) to avenge the death of their master at the hands of the wicked Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano).According to Wikipedia, 47 Ronin is estimated to be the biggest box office bomb based on absolute loss on worldwide gross—and it's not too difficult to understand why: this lavish CGI-filled epic features stunning production design, including impressive sets and beautiful costumery, all of which clearly cost a small fortune, and the largely Japanese cast is headed by A-lister Reeves, who doesn't come cheap. With the film slated by critics for being slow and lifeless, there weren't nearly enough bums on cinema seats to recoup the whopping $175m budget ($225m including distribution and marketing).Based on a real-life event in Japanese history, but embellished with supernatural elements (an oriental '300'), the film definitely had the potential to be hugely entertaining, but with a wooden central performance by Reeves, a preposterous script, lousy dialogue and lacklustre direction by fledgling director Carl Rinsch, who conducts proceedings with an ill-advised air of pomposity, the whole affair proves incredibly unengaging.",47 Ronin
12,Scarecrow-88,47 Ronin,4,27 September 2014,"47 Ronin is all generic, Hollywood plotting and I can totally understand why the Japanese audiences didn't buy into this film which infiltrates their history with some half-breed white-Japanese character who was abandoned in the mystical spiritual Tengu Forest, trained by the lord of this forest, and expected to abandon the world and its men, not doing so. Plastered right on the front is Keanu Reeves, and Hiroyuki Sanada, who, to me, is the real star kind of fades a bit in the backgroundso why would Japanese audiences clamor fervently for it? Reeves, of course, has unmatched skills and supernatural abilities thanks to his connection with Lord Tengu (the Sea of Trees has this amazing Buddha head with its mouth the gateway to a cavernous lair that has ""magical swords of superior quality"" if both Reeves and Sanada can withstand ""tests""), while Sanada has charisma, command, and quiet intensity in his favor. No doubt, after watching this, that the wrong actor received the spotlight. Reeves is on auto-pilot (I know this man has talent, The Gift proves that, but he needs to be somehow nudged into performing to his abilities which is rare) with a face that seems to care very little. Well, Tadanobu Asano is your garden variety villain as Lord Kira, adversary of Sanada's Oishi. Kira has a witch played by Rinko Kikuchi (stealing the film, reveling in the juicy part as a villainess with total relish in her evil) behind him as he plans to eventually replace Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's Shogun as total ruler of Japan. There's the set up of Oishi's leader of Ako, Min Tanaka's Lord Asano, with the use of a spider and its hallucinogenic venom thanks to the witch's incantation, literally pulling it from the arm of Kira. So revenge is the obvious motive behind Oishi's 47 Ronin, avenging Asano's ""forced Seppuku"" and attacking Kira for his treachery in a Trojan Horse plot after enlisting aid in a comedy/drama acting troupe during a wedding ceremony (oh, yeah, Kira is given Asano's daughter, Mika (Ko Shibasaki), who—yep—is in love with Reeves' Kaiyawn). The set and costume design, and location shooting are the true stars, but I have no idea why Kai's former ""father"", Lord Tengu, looks like an alien. There's the witch in the form of the dragon, a giant beast man Kai must fight in an underground Dutch island fight-club, and a large ferocious animal (with multiple eyes, lion-sized torso, and bulging tusks) as special effects that Reeves must endure as the other samurai seem inconsequential except to either be tossed around, killed, or stunt doubles standing in the background. This was a major flop for a reasonformulaic story that creates a character for Americans to identify with, Japanese speaking English, and a severe lack of blood despite the overabundance of ritual suicide and swordplay thanks to the PG-13 rating (which ultimately did it no favors as audiences still stayed away). There's even an intimidating warrior in golden armor that stands tall over all, but he's no match for explosives. Still, Rinko Kikuchi has lots of fun as the witch and her harassment of Mika, including a homoerotic challenge to commit suicide like her father, provides some hissable villainy.",47 Ronin
13,LeonLouisRicci,Bloodless Samurai Movie That Just Doesn't Cut It,5,14 May 2014,"All the Costumes, Color, and Beautiful Lush Scenery even if Combined with a Classic Historical Story of Samurai is not going to Cut-It if the Movie Never goes Beyond Pageantry and Purely Pedestrian, Poetic Nonsense.

14,CinemaSerf,Too much of an ask for Keanu Reeves but still a good story.,6,14 March 2020,"Keanu Reeves is ""Kai"" an adopted boy taken into the house of a feudal Japanese lord ""Asano"" as a child. There he is trained as a samurai under the auspices of Ôishi and falls in love with the lord's daughter.

The samurai are disbanded and after a year of ignominy as ""Ronin"" they set out to avenge their betrayed master and restore their honour (and, of course, for ""Kai"" to get his girl!). This is a story of Japanese legend that has been quite freely adapted (Reeves' character is an addition) but that ought not to detract too much from what is essentially a very good looking, stylish and enjoyable adventure movie based around traditions of honour and respect. It is, however, quite stodgily scripted and maybe twenty minutes too long, with a good supporting cast that is needed to compensate for the star's rather wooden performance.",47 Ronin

16,zardoz-13,A Most Un-Excellent Samurai Saga,5,29 December 2013,"Ethnocentrism occurs when one culture appropriates something from another culture and then attempts to enhance it. The latest version of the legendary Genroku Akō incident, the tragic 18th century Japanese account of samurai warriors avenging their fallen leader, displays all the vestiges of ethnocentrism. Mind you, the Japanese produced six previous cinematic adaptations about their historic milestone before Hollywood tampered with it. For the record, those movies were ""The 47 Ronin"" (1941), ""Chûshingura"" (1958), ""Chushingura"" (1962), ""The Fall of Ako Castle"" (1978), ""47 Ronin"" (1994) and ""The Last Chushingura (2010). Presumably, Hollywood must have felt that this constituted an ideal opportunity to produce its own spin on this venerable story. Not surprisingly, Universal Studios has taken considerable liberties with the material. Not only has the studio embroidered this renowned tale of honor with outlandish supernatural elements, specifically demons and witchcraft, but it also has added a half-breed European supporting character to the yarn. Presumably, Universal must have felt that attracting an American audience to a $200-million plus film primarily about the Japanese would only recoup its costs if a major American actor got mixed up in it. Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"" trilogy appears as the improbable white guy who sets the catastrophic events of the Akō vendetta into motion as well as dictates how the Japanese can resolve their dreadful predicament. Freshman director Carl Rinsch and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" scribe Hossein Amini have fashioned a conventional chronicle of samurai versus samurai, with a grim finale that precludes any thought of a sequel. If you know nothing about the outrageous revisions that the filmmakers have imposed on the most celebrated instance of the samurai code of honor, you will probably enjoy this scenic saga about sword and sorcery a lot more. Imagine what any important event in American history would emerge as if a Japanese individual interfered with it and you'll have a good idea about ""47 Ronin."" ""47 Ronin"" takes place in feudal Japan in the 1700s. Lord Asano (Min Tanaka of ""Black Dawn"") of the Ako province adopts a wandering teenager, Kai (Keanu Reeves), who is the son of a British sailor and a Japanese peasant. The boy's mother abandoned him, and demons raised him. Eventually Kai ran away from them and Lord Asano took him in as one of his own. Kai grew up with Asano's daughter, Mika (Kô Shibasaki of ""One Missed Call""), and the two become romantically attracted to each other. Meanwhile, since Kai is a half-breed, he cannot serve Lord Asano as a samurai. Instead, he functions as the equivalent of a scout. The first major scene shows him slaying a massive beast that resembles an enormous buffalo with tree branches for antlers. Naturally, another samurai warrior, Yasuno (Masayoshi Haneda of ""Emperor""), claims credit for the kill, but Asano's number one samurai, Ôishi (Hiroyuki Sanada of ""The Wolverine""), knows the truth. Later, Lord Asano welcomes his supreme leader, Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa of ""Mortal Combat""), to his palatial estate along with his chief rival, Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano of ""Thor: The Dark World""), from the nearby Nagato province. The villainous Kira conspires with the aid of a demonic, shape-shifting witch, (Rinko Kikuchi of ""Pacific Rim""), to drug Asano into attacking him. The witch uses a bulbous spider to deliver a drug across Asano's lips while he is asleep so that he awakens and imagines that Kira is raping his daughter. Appalled by his own behavior, Asano follows the dictates of the Shogun in committing ritual suicide. Ôishi blames himself for letting these events transpire, especially after Kai warned him about the witch. Everybody but Asano and his daughter treats Kai with utter contempt. After Asano slashes his belly open with a knife, Ôishi completes the ordeal by decapitating his master. The heartless Shogun banishes all Asano's samurai who are now designated as ronin. At the same time, Kira sells Kai into slavery where Kai becomes a highly prized combatant in arena showdowns. The Shogun commands Mika to marry Kira after mourning the death of her father for a year. Kira has Ôishi thrown into a dungeon where he spends the next year. Eventually, after he is released, the vengeance driven Ôishi assembles the remaining samurai and persuades Kai to join them as they set out to deal with the murderous Kira.Compared with other samurai sages, ""47 Ronin"" is fairly routine stuff. The battle sequences lack grandeur, and the sword play is pretty dull. The massive ritual suicide at the end isn't exactly what American audiences will enjoy. Imagine ""Star Wars"" ending with everybody eviscerating themselves at fade-out and you have a good idea what to expect. This big-budgeted spectacle also suffers from second-rate special effects. Most of the sprawling mountain backdrops are clearly computer-generated, while the swirling witch's dragon looks like something out of a Chinatown carnival. Presumably, Rinsch and his writers decided to rely on sorcery because nobody knows for certain why Asano attacked his guest in real-life. The way that Asano is poisoned is reminiscent of how the Japanese girl died at the hands of Ninjas in the James Bond movie ""You Only Live Twice.""

17,neil-476,"OK, but nothing special",7,3 January 2014,"After their Lord Asano is manoeuvred into having to commit seppuku by scheming rival Lord Kira (who has magical assistance from a witch), his samurai are made masterless ronin by the Shogun and forbidden to seek revenge. Nonetheless, they do so since the dishonour of not doing so outweighs the certain death that will result from disobeying the Shogun's order. This adaptation of an actual historical event in 18th century Japan is tweaked by the addition of whizzo magical CGI effects, and the insertion of Keanu Reeves as a socially unacceptable half-breed love interest for Lord Asano's daughter. This has the perhaps unfortunate effect of turning a story which is quite dramatic enough by itself into fantasy fodder, and dilutes the tragedy and grace of the true story accordingly.Having said that, what results is a decent action / adventure / fantasy romp which does boast a resolution which is satisfactory but not, by any stretch of the imagination, your standard happy ending. Reeves is adequate: most of the cast are better. The action is well handled (and there is quite a lot of it), the effects are decent, and the setting feels authentic.The 3D, added in post-production, is rubbish: there were times where the image looked as if they hadn't even bothered to do any 3D work, particularly when the Ronin were walking through the bamboo forest.",47 Ronin
18,Uriah43,Could Have Been So Much Better,6,2 January 2014,"This movie begins with a young half-English/half-Japanese boy running through the woods before finally collapsing to the ground. The young boy is named ""Kai"" (Keanu Reeves) and when he is found unconscious by the daimyo of the local province ""Lord Asano"" (Min Tanaka) he is adopted into the lord's household. Unfortunately, the rest of the samurai in the province look down upon him because of his mixed raced and treat him quite rudely. Everyone except for the beautiful daughter of Lord Asano named ""Mika"" (Ko Shibasaki). She falls in love with him and the feeling is reciprocated even though both of them know that their love cannot be allowed. It soon all comes to a head when ""Shogun Tsunayoshi"" (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) comes to visit along with ""Lord Kira"" (Tadanobu Asano) from a rival province. With Lord Kira is a beautiful ""Witch"" (Rinko Kikuchi) who has devised a scheme with him to acquire Lord Asano's province through witchcraft and treachery. Anyway, rather than divulge what happens next and possibly ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it let me just say that this movie had an engaging story that was fairly entertaining for the most part. I liked the scenery and I thought the acting was pretty decent. I also appreciated both of the beautiful ladies just mentioned. However, some of the graphics were almost laughable and the action seemed to detract from the movie rather than add to it. On that note, I thought this movie could have been so much better if it had taken a more serious and realistic tone than what was presented. In any case, it's worth a look and I rate it as slightly above average.",47 Ronin

This falls in to the latter of the two, but by Jove, I had a ball watching it.The best way to describe this film is a Lord Of The Rings/Last Samurai/Krull/Matrix hybrid, and if you think that sounds bizarre, add a little bit of Pirates of the Caribbean.Reeves isn't the main focus of this film, he just sets up the set pieces, instead, it's the samurais mission that the film focuses on.

20,siderite,A bit underwhelming,7,27 December 2013,"The film was a bit of a disappointment for several reasons. First of all , it was completely inaccurate, as history goes (the Wikipedia article on Forty-Seven Ronin is very informative). But I didn't know that when I watched the film. Then it was the special effects that filled the trailer. Those are pretty much all you will see in the film and some (like the heavily tattooed man) have no real relevance to the script. You can always know that a film is close to crap when the trailer contains all the good scenes. Then it is the acting itself: Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but his role was shallow and one dimensional - basically a cross between Neo and Johnny Mnemonic, but without good lines - and overshadowed by the screen presence of his Japanese ally, played by Hiroyuki Sanada. And finally the script, which was a Westernised story of sorceresses and demons and mystical styles of fighting which had almost nothing to do not only with the actual events, but with Japanese culture (at least as I know it).Bottom line: it would have probably been more boring if all they showed was an arrogant government official getting annoyed for not getting a high enough bribe and getting into a knife attack when he oversteps propriety then getting killed two years later in his home, but even as such, this was pretty underwhelming. I expected all kinds of (otherwise classic) Hollywood tricks, but even those were forgotten in this overly simplistic script. Let me be clear: even the ""boss fights"" were boring.Did I enjoy the movie? I wasn't really entertained, but I didn't mind watching it. But I also would not recommend it to anyone.

The action-sequences, without doubt, are excellent. Even the execution of the action-sequences is top-notch. But how one wishes if '47 Ronin' had a stronger Screenplay.

23,Hellmant,Visually stunning but emotionally boring.,6,8 January 2014,"'47 RONIN': Three Stars (Out of Five)Fantastical and highly fictionalized retelling of the classic 'forty-seven Ronin' tale, about a real-life samurai group (in 18th century Japan) who sets out to avenge the killing of their master. The film stars Keanu Reeves and a number of Japanese actors (including Hiroyuki Sanada, Tadanobu Asano, Rinko Kikuchi, Kou Shibasaki and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Carl Rinsch and written by Chris Morgan, Hossein Amini and Walter Hamada. I found the movie to be visually stunning but emotionally boring (as I had an especially hard time paying attention to a lot of it).Reeves plays Kai, a half-Japanese and half-British wannabe samurai who joins the others on their mission (his character was created for the film). Sanada plays Kuranosuke Oishi, the leader of the Ronin. Asano plays the movie's main villain, Lord Kira, who murdered the samurai's master. Kikuchi plays the evil witch who assists Kira. Shibasaki plays Kai's love interest Mika and Tagawa plays Shogun Tsunayoshi. As I said the movie takes several liberties with the classic story (which I'm not that familiar with).The movie cost $175 million to make, which was a huge risk taken by the film's backers (with a first-time director and a has-been star like Keanu Reeves)! So of course it bombed at the box office but the studio says it was prepared for it's failure. Given it's poor performance and overwhelmingly bad reviews I was expecting the film to be pretty bad as well but it isn't. The special effects and action are more than decent and the performances and dialogue aren't that painful to sit through either. The melodrama and romance are cheesy but they seem appropriate for a movie like this. Due to the subject matter and genre of the film I couldn't get that interested in what was going on though. I like big epic historical fiction action flicks but this one (despite not being horrible) seemed somewhat boring and stale. Had I been interested in the material I might have been a lot more entertained by it but for me it wasn't that involving. Maybe upon a repeat viewing I might be more amused though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny7Y7pgmZpA",47 Ronin

25,bowmanblue,"Stylish and interesting, but also slightly odd",6,20 July 2014,"'47 Ronin' is actually based on an old Japanese historical event when 47 samurai avenged the death and disgrace of their master, even if it marked them as 'criminals.' This tale is very well known and documented in Japan and people still visit the graves of the deceased in order to remember their commitment to their cause.It's been made into a film at least six times before, but this is the most 'Hollywood' version to date. For a start, we have Keanu Reeves as the lead character and it's fair to say that no westerners took part in the actual event. Therefore, it's safe to say that many liberties have been taken in this retelling. This point is hammered home by the inclusion of various mythological creatures our valiant exiled samurai encounter. And, I'm just guessing, but I'm pretty sure there weren't any dragon-witches or giant ogres in Japan back then.So, don't expect a faithful re-telling of the historical event. But, do expect entertainment. I don't know why, but 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' kept going through my mind while I was watching this. The whole affair sort of reminded me of Captain Jack Sparrow in the Far East. Every so often there's a chase scene or a monster to fight and there are plenty of CGI backdrops for us to pretend are real. Perhaps the one thing that isn't really included is an awful lot of fight scenes. I expected more 'martial arts' from a film about samurai, but there's only a couple of swordplay scenes included.All in all, it's not a bad adventure film, but it's kind of hard to think who its primary audience is. Like I said, it doesn't have enough fights to be a martial arts film. It's not 'fun for all the family' like Pirates of the Caribbean, so it's more serious. If you like supernatural action/adventure movies which have had all the major gore and adult-stuff edited out, then you might like this. Keanu Reeves is 'the star,' but it's the supporting Japanese cast that really hold it together.I didn't regret watching it, but I doubt I'd ever watch it again. I've got a hundred better action adventure films already in my collection.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",47 Ronin
26,dromasca,samurais in Hollywood,8,15 August 2018,"The laws of commercial success or failure are complicated. '47 Ronin' is a film that failed completely at the box office and is considered one of the biggest losers of the Universal Studios in the current decade, despite of belonging to a popular genre (fantasy action movie) and despite having Keanu Reeves as lead actor. I actually liked the film, and some of the reasons may be the same that let to its commercial disaster.'47 Ronin' is based on an 18th century historical event which took place in a Japan led by the shoguns who decided to close its gates and shores to foreigners and all but cut the ties with the external world. It's a bloody story of revenge and sacrifice that raises issues of honor, tradition, and respect for authority very close to the essence of the Japanese soul. The story was taken over by oral and written literature and later by cinema, with a romantic intrigue of impossible love being added among other. The approach in telling the story and the perspective taken by the writer or film director tells a lot about the way tradition and the whole era of the shogunate are being perceived. I can understand that Japanese viewers may dislike the Hollywoodization of the story. Script writer Chris Morgan and film director Carl Rinsch have taken the Japanese story into the territory of fantasy action movies. Feudal Japan is in their vision a land populated by spirits of the forest, dragons and witches. It's pure entertainment, and this is the main angle this film needs to be judged from.I found the result more than satisfying in the limits of its genre. The film is spoken in English, but I guess it would have had no chances otherwise in the American cinema theaters. The majority of the acting team is composed of Japanese actors, some of them well-known in Hollywood and they all do a fine job: Hiroyuki Sanada is the noble commander of the samurais revenging their murdered and dishonored master, Hiroyuki Sanada represents the dark side oponent, Ko Shibasaki gathers beauty and delicacy for the lead feminine role, while Rinko Kikuchi is best in the feminine role of a witch with transcending powers. In order to match the Caucasian physiognomy of Keanu Reeves the authors of the script had to invent a biography of a mixed race cavalier who did not appear in the original story. The role will not be remembered as a peak of his acting career, but he did not do less or worse than many other lead stars in action movies. Cinematography is beautiful, costumes are colorful and expressive, and the action scenes are well choreographed. '47 Ronin' is a well made action movie which succeeds to be true to the essence of the story despite the liberties taken by the Hollywood adaptation of the story. It may lack authenticity, but purist can always find on youTube the Japanese film with the same name made in 1941. It is all spoken in Japanese (with subtitles) and it lasts longer than 3 and half hours.",47 Ronin
27,g-bodyl,A Legend To Behold!,8,22 January 2015,"Despite being a major box office bomb and dreadful reviews, I have come to thoroughly enjoy 47 Ronin. Now the story isn't entirely logical and the character development is not entirely fleshened out, but I still had a good time watching a film with the internationally renowned cast. I loved how they took a true story and told it through the eyes from the fantasy genre, my favorite genre. The film is an action spectacle full of action, good CGI creatures, and film based around ancient Japanese culture.Carl Rinsch's film is about a half breed man named Kai who is looked down as an outcast in the domain of Ako, especially by the samurai. But after the murder of Lord Asano, the samurai are banned from the kingdom. The leader, Oishi recruits the help of Kai for a quest of revenge.The only big name actor, at least in the eyes of Americans, is Keanu Reeves. People criticize Reeves often, but for a man with limited range, this is a perfect role. He is not required to show much emotion and he is able to spring into action mode as well. Hiroyuki Sanada is very good as Oishi, the man who grudgingly agrees to recruit Kai. Also Tadanobu Asano is pretty good as the villainous Lord Kira.Overall, this was a pretty fun film. It has striking visuals and there is no shortage of action. I also liked the script, which is pleasantly better than I expected. But the story needs tweaking and more explaining. I would have loved to find out more about the evil witch and where she came from. The movie with this stature should have been much longer. But on the whole, not a bad film.....at least in my eyes. It doesn't compare to films such as the Last Samurai, but it's entertaining in its own way. I rate this film 8/10.",47 Ronin
28,A_Different_Drummer,"""When a Crime Remains Unpunished..",7,15 March 2014,"... the world is out of balance."" The one criticism that cannot be made of this film is that it is unbalanced. If anything, the attempt by the director to give weight and dignity to each stage of the play, to each single act of the heroes and villains, works against the entertainment value of the production - especially for western audiences -- creating too many pauses, too many pregnant moments where nothing happens. I confess I liked this film, but I also confess that I have a weakness for these oh-so-serious Asian soap operas. Most viewers may not be as generous. During the slow spots -- and there were many -- I came to the realization that this story was cut from the same cloth as the classic and iconic Magnificent Seven; only this time, of course, we have the ""magnificent 47"" going against insurmountable odds. Which realization (remember, there are ample periods of nonactivity here, and they encourage contemplation!) was quickly followed by remembering -- mea culpa -- that the aforementioned iconic western was itself a riff on an iconic 1950s Japanese film, The Seven Samurai. Not to suggest for a moment that the Japanese invented the American western, but rather that sometimes the line is simply hard to draw. Keanu Reeves continues to distinguish himself as the youngest-looking middle-aged guy in films. He is pushing 50, but here he plays the young hero looking to save the even younger heroine, and darn if he doesn't pull it off. Without CGI, to boot. Look folks, this is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, nor is it Reeves best work, nor is it likely to be a film you will be savoring for weeks afterwards, But it has its charms.",47 Ronin

The only other CGI of a flowing robe becoming a person or snake was artful but became tiresomely cutesy & redundant after being shown excessively over and over. 5. Clothes, props and sets were Hollywood cheap; very synthetic plastic/polyester looking. 6. Not up to the grandeur of Asian film with immense numbers of cast and authentic period pieces - very low budget. 7. Emotions also were more Westernized such as the overly emphasized - jealousy. The producers, director and script writers must have been banking on American/European audiences to pay the bills thus the Western emphasis. 8. Acting was robotic; especially the Reeves character with the constant stiff bowing and weak emulation of old TV samurai style shows. 9. So cheap was this film that they didn't even budget in either prosthetics or CGI of Seppuku acts by our characters. The emotional highlight of the story. 10.

While many of the major scenes rendered in the movie reflected authentic historical records, dramatic license was incorporated into the movie script to include a fanciful romantic relationship and a supernatural witch. Unlike the more popular and highly regarded Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"" action-drama movie released a decade earlier, 47 Ronin has more focus on the additional storyline with its bittersweet romance and a predominate theme of adherence to cultural traditions of honor and sacrifice. The action trailer of 47 Ronin grossly diverges markedly from movie with its more drama-oriented script that selectively incorporates vivid, exciting action sequences that results in a much slower paced movie than strongly suggested in the trailer unfortunately upending audience expectations. In the climatic final action scenes, the ronin seem to behave more like ninja than samurai, but nevertheless increases the fictional richness of captivating action of this portion of the movie. Overall, the movie, offers up a fine subtle balance between the supernatural which is only used sparingly with affect and a richly presented period drama that in the end intensely portrays the harsh but proud honorable nature of the Japanese psyche of the Edo period.",47 Ronin
33,The-Sarkologist,"I so wanted to like this film, however it just falls flat",4,4 February 2014,"I remember a time when people would flock to the cinemas when a new Keanu Reeves movie came along, but these days he just does not seem to have the same pulling power as he did in the days of The Matrix and Point Break. I first became familiar with Reeves with the two Bill and Ted movies, which are still some of my all time favourite films, but these days, and this movie is a prime example, he seems to have just fallen flat. In a way I really wanted to like this movie, and for a while I was caught up in it, but as it moved along, and it wasn't slow by any means, my interest simply began to wane.47 Ronin is an adaptation of a Japanese tale of 47 Ronin whose master was killed by treachery and they then spent two years plotting their revenge. When they had succeeded the emperor chose, instead of executing them like common criminals, to allow them to die an honourable death by committing sepuku. While I do appreciate Asian stories (and I am really interested in going and seeing The Monkey King on Friday, if it is still showing at Melbourne Central), I am finding some of these Western adaptations to, in a way, destroy the mystique that seems to fill them.It is not that all Hollywood adaptation of Asian stories are bad, for instance the Forbidden Kingdom is still an awesome movie, which I have now seen three times, and have put the DVD in my 'to keep collection' as opposed to my 'get rid of before DVDs become obsolete' collection (though with the rate that I am moving through them they will probably become obsolete before I am able to get rid of them all, but that is another story). I remember that a major criticism of Cruise's Last Samurai was that it in effect Westernised a Japanese story, and in many cases this film does the same.It is not that the monsters and the magic in the film are necessarily Westernised. The creators do make an attempt to give an oriental feel to the film, and I did try to suspend my disbelief in relation to the pirate haven that the visited, and the fact that a major character is a half Japanese mongrel, but in many cases it really pushed the limits of my ability to accept it. The problem with Japanese tales, especially introducing Western elements to them, is that the Japanese society was closed society up until the middle of the 19th century when the Americans sailed a warship into Tokyo harbour and told them to open up or else (from which we get the term 'Gunship diplomacy'). As such, I find it very difficult to accept a Japanese story with Western elements thrown into it. However, for some reason, I do find that the Chinese stories work a little better.Oh, the other thing that undermined my ability to suspend my disbelief is that pretty much all of the crew seemed to be American in origin, and thus it appeared to be very much an American film, made by Americans, using Asian actors to give it some form of Oriental appearance (and I would not be surprised if it turns out that the Asian actors are actually Chinese as opposed to Japanese).",47 Ronin
34,Reno-Rangan,A fine collaboration between American crew and Japanese cast.,7,1 April 2014,"West meets east like the movie 'The Last Samurai'. Visually impressive movie from the debutant director. It was based on the Japanese history of 47 samurais who are on the verge to avenge their master's death. But the movie was more fictional than realistic and soared with great CGI touch.This is second in a row for Keanu Reeves, whose movie is attached to easter culture or history. As for this story his facial look was well blended with mixed race, half British and half Japanese. Sadly, it was not shot inside the Japan, not even a single shot, but you know todays computer graphics can bring any kind of atmosphere.The movie about samurais mean most of them won't have a happy ending. If you are familiar with this genre you will be well known about what seppuku means. Yeah the movie deals with some serious matters like that apart from fictional extend of history. It was a crucial performance by Keanu Reeves among other faces. But the real letdown was some key moments of the movie, like many scenes were depicted Hollywood style fantasies. I truly missed Japanese techniques in film presentation, but will please the western audience.It was a nice collaboration between American filmmakers and Japanese cast.

35,Dr_Coulardeau,"Apart from special effects, quite hollow",6,7 September 2014,"This is a film made for 3D effects. Those effects are more important than anything else in the film. This particular product has the film in normal Blu-ray Disc for those who are not equipped or for those who do not care for the 3D effects because they obliterate your critical vision.That is just the point. The film as for its content is very limited. In the Samurai times of Japan two rival local rulers get into some kind of strife because the younger ruler uses the services of a witch to reach his target and that target is to get the older ruler from next door eliminated and his daughter bound to marry him. At the same time the Samurais of the older ruler are banned and forbidden to take revenge.A half-breed, Kai, half European, half Japanese, rejected by all, has been trained by some special and sort of supernatural Buddhist order and as such has developed some super power, essentially extreme speed in reactions and unexpected attack from the side negotiating the direct central attack. The banned Samurais get him out of his slavery as a prize fighter on some ship in some harbor to provide them with his special powers and his contact with his original order to get weapons. That's how they end up 47 Samurais against the younger ruler on the day when he is going to be married to the daughter of the older ruler. The rest is only special effects and the end is banal.The supreme ruler of Japan imposes the normal end to the disobedient Samurais: death by their own hands, seppuku or ritual disembowelment (don't worry you only see the shoulders of the Samurais: no bowels are visible: note that kind of death is a slow death). Only one is saved: the son of the leading Samurai. An ending showing the honor code of these Samurais who are eliminated though they only asked for justice and since it was not given to them they just took justice in their own hands and worked it out by themselves. When a system reaches such a point of absurdity it is bound to end very badly. And it did in 1945.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",47 Ronin
36,leonblackwood,An unexpected joy to watch! 7/10,7,17 May 2014,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie. It had a very traditional Japanese movie feel and great action throughout. The storyline was well put together by the director and you can really see were there big budget went, with all of the glamorous costumes and amazing scenery. The love story was a bit cheesy, but it spoil the whole flow of the movie. I'm in two minds about Keanu Reeves though. He just seemed misplaced throughout the film and he looked like he didn't know what to do with himself. All the way through the movie, he's treated like an outcast, even though he keeps on saving there ass, and he never gets the recognition that he truly deserves. Being called a half breed through your whole life would make anyone turn against the people that you live and work for, but he is a loyal servant he shows that his skills are very much needed. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and you can't help feeling touched by the amazing courage of the 47 Ronin. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I honestly think that this film might have got a bigger audience if Keanu Reeves wasn't in it, for some unknown reason. The funny thing is that he isn't really the main character, as advertised, and it more about the legacy than an individual. As for his performance, he doesn't really say that much through the movie, but his fighting skills were impressive. Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays the leader of the Ronin, played his part extremely well and he brought all of the in depth emotion to the film.

37,TheMovieDiorama,47 Ronin wasted forty-six talented Japanese actors whilst decimating Chushingura in the process.,3,9 May 2020,"The revenge of the forty-seven ronin, which details a band of leaderless samurai avenging the death of their master, has been retold, performed and fictionalised since the incident's conception in 18th-Century feudal Japan. The legend depicts daimyo Asano ordered to perform ritualised suicide, seppuku, at the behest of the Emperor after assaulting a court official named Kira. One year passes, and his now leaderless samurai re-group after their disbandment to avenge Asano's death. An emblematic tale of loyalty, honour and sacrifice that has popularised Japanese culture for many years. Tropes that would influence legendary filmmakers such as Kurosawa and Ozu. Whilst these themes are heavily implied throughout Rinsch's fantastical rendition of Chushingura, minimal resemblance was supplied to the renowned historical epic itself.It is extraordinarily rare for Hollywood to depict Eastern culture with the correct amount of precision and accuracy, only touched upon in such recent features as Zwick's 'The Last Samurai' and Marshall's 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. Its ultimate failure, especially in 47 Ronin's case, is how Americanised the world, characters and story are when compared to authentic productions within the native country of Japan. For starters, employing an apparent Anglo-Japanese character as the audience's gateway into Japanese traditions. Firstly, it's historically incorrect, distracting from the validity and purpose of the tale. Secondly, it relinquishes the talents of its authentic cast that should've had complete control, particularly Sanada, Asano and Kikuchi. Thirdly, it's borderline insulting. No blame on Reeves' part, despite the abhorrently monotonous performance that would drive most sane individuals into executing seppuku themselves. But his inclusion arguably whitewashes the event, especially when the ronin suddenly become dependant upon him.Alas, this was to be expected from a Hollywood blockbuster, so some leniency should be offered. It's a visualised feast that provides proficient production design alongside its vividly colourful costumes, designed by Rose. These combine together to form a shell of a former foreign land. A land with zero personality and/or flavour. Every mundane action set piece, to which the second act continuously follows one after the other, adds to the one-dimensional insipidness that Rinsch clearly could not direct. The characters themselves, aside from the courageous bravery that exuded from their emotionless faces, supplied minimal fluctuations to the story. It was all one-note. From the six-eyed beast hunt to the inevitable climactic sacrifice. Speaking of beasts, the supposedly epic fantasy elements were pointless. Failing to enhance the grandeur of its medieval world and act as sufficient plot devices. But hey, at least Kikuchi plays a witch of delectably hammy proportions whom transforms into a levitating serpent!47 Ronin is nothing more than an aesthetically pleasing empty replication of a story and culture that withholds plenty of character. For every beautiful pagoda in the distance, there is a monotonous line such as ""I will search for you through a thousand worlds and ten thousand lifetimes until I find you"". Urgh, such a waste of a perfectly reputable cast...",47 Ronin
38,digitalbeachbum,"Another real life story, ruined by Hollywood",1,28 August 2018,"The true story of 47 Ronin is about a Lord, Asano Naganori, in Japan who is executed for breaking the law of the Emperor. The Lord, draws his sword an area where no swords are supposed to be drawn, but he does it to slice at the Magistrate, Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, who has insulted him.The Lord accepts his fate but after he dies, the 47 Ronin don't know what to do being with out a Lord. So they spend the next 18 months preparing to seek revenge and to fulfill their promise to follow their Lord unto death.The go to Tokyo and execute the Magistrate then take his head to the graveyard of their Lord, wash the head, then put it on the grave of their Lord.They then wait for the police to come and they accept their punishment.46 of the Ronin committed seppuku, which is a ritual suicide and considered honorable. The 47th Ronin, Terasaka Kichiemon was too young and pardoned by the Shogun.The original story is amazing and told in various movies and television productions from Japan. The movie Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki is legendary along with Swords of Vengeance: Fall of Ako Castle.The 47 Ronin movie from 2013 is an insult and should not carry the same name",47 Ronin
39,Vartiainen,Lacks passion,3,1 August 2014,"The tale of 47 ronin is as central to Japanese cultural identity and character as Shakespeare is to the English, Charlemagne to the French, Kalevala to the Finns. It epitomizes and crystallizes their ideals, their way of life, their code of honour, their bushido. So what do we get when Keanu Reeves of Matrix fame inserts himself into this story as a foreigner named Kai, raised by the good lord Asano Naganori (Min Tanaka). Oh, and what if the story suddenly has sorceresses, mystical beasts and magical kung fu?In short, a fairly decent fantasy film that utterly fails to capture the central essence of the original story. If you know nothing about the historical events or the basics of bushido, then this film will probably entertain you just fine. It looks at times breathtakingly beautiful, all the sword fights and action scenes flow smoothly and it has enough of the original story to remain interesting and captivating.The film's stumbling blocks are the rather weak story and the uneven acting performances. Keanu Reeves nails the physical aspect of his performance, but fails to impress you as a three-dimensional character. The same with the rest of them, with perhaps the exception Rinko Kikuchi, who's at least memorable, though a tad over the top.I also wish that if they decided to mix fantasy into the story, they would have gone all out with it. Now it feels more like an afterthought most of the time. There are some really good designs and ideas, but none of them really add anything into the story.Yet, in my heart of hearts I cannot blame this film. It tries. The director's lack of understanding shines through, but Reeves's obvious respect for the culture saves a lot and as a whole it is entertaining, if not all that great. Look it up for the visuals and the popcorn aspect of it.",47 Ronin
40,DarkVulcan29,"Not great, but not terrible either.",7,31 December 2013,"The film itself is loosely based on the real story of The 47 Ronin, while trying to fix some elements of fantasy. The style of the film was well done, making it feel very artsy in spots. The fight scenes are enjoyable, but the down fall, I feel it all goes by too quick, there is no epicness to the battles, it feels like they where in a real hurry to get the film done.Keanu Reeves is good part of the movie, but in some parts he is quite wooden. But proves he still got it since The Matrix films. Although he is the star, the other supporting players all get there chance to shine. The effects are quite descent, nothing too great. Although I found it amusing, it's not a film I would want to sit through again.",47 Ronin
41,freemantle_uk,A 300 knock-off,4,9 November 2014,"Based on the Japanese legend of the 47 ronin who avenged their lord the film version was a massive box-office bomb for Universal as they attempt to make their own version of 300.In Feudal Japan Kai (Keanu Reeves) is an outcast who is taken in by the household of Lord Asano (Min Tanaka). Skilled with a sword Kai is racially abused by his peers. But when Asano is framed for murder and forced to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) his samurais are left masterless, outcasts themselves and Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) is set to take over the lord via marriage. It is up to Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) to save the land and the princess and has to team up with his old rival Kai to achieve it.Akira Kurosawa this isn't! The costumes are bright and colourful and first time director Carl Rinsch was able to make some sequences look impressive particularly near the beginning. Some of the action sequences were solid, but they were compromised due to the PG-13/12A rating.47 Ronin has a $175 Million budget and it is hard to see where they spend the money. The special effects were weak considering the money, looking very fake and digital. The film had a realistic look so the CGI clashed when set direction compared to 300 which could get away with not so great CGI because it embraced a comic book style. Except for Reeves the cast was made up of Japanese actors, some of them fairly well known but would not command a great price tag.Much of the acting is poor. Many of the actors have the excuse that English is not their first language, though actors like Sanada, Asano and Rinko Kikuchi (the best performer) have been in Hollywood blockbuster. Reeves lives up to his infamous wooden reputation and was a poor lead for the film. He was not a big enough draw for Western audiences and Asian audiences were turned away by the film because a famous Japanese legend was fronted by an North American actor.There was plenty of potential in the story to be either a series epic in the tradition of great Japanese cinema or a fun romp like 300 but the filmmakers wanted to be both, being deadly serious about material while also being pulpy with its fantasy elements of witches, shapeshifting and ghost warriors. Even weirder is the film ends with a dedication to the ronin as if it was a historical film instead of being of a fantasy film: even 300 did not do that and it was based on a known historic event.",47 Ronin
42,ebiros2,"Not at all close to the true story of the ""Ako roshi""",7,8 May 2017,"Good but the real story of 47 ronin as it happened in history is not represented in this movie. Kira who was the shogun's manner instructor didn't get the customary bribe, so he didn't teach Asano the proper way to greet the Shogun in the actual story, and was humiliated for improper greeting of shogun which enraged him to draw a sword against Kira in the castle which was crime punishable by death. Ooishi and 47 ronin who lost their master swore vengeance on Kira, and that was the story of 47 ronin. Here the story is more like a fantasy. Since the story here is an American original, this review is for an American fiction movie. It's kind of a bastardization of how samurai lived in their days, and creating good action movie. As such, movie is of good quality, and doesn't disappoint. While some of the premise seems ridiculous to the ones versed in the way of samurai, that is forgiven as ignorance towards the true culture of the samurai. Some American movie has done a better job in this area (like the Last Samurai ),this is an acceptable and interesting version of 47 ronin.",47 Ronin
43,stevendbeard,Mystical Japanese Folktale,7,25 December 2013,"I saw ""47 Ronin"", Keanu Reeves-The Day the Earth Stood Still-2008, the Matrix movies; Hiroyuki Sanada-The Wolverine, Rush Hour 3; Ko Shibasaki- Galileo-t.v., One Missed Call-2003 and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa-Balls of Fury, Mortal Kombat.This is a mystical Samurai story based on a Japanese folktale. I say mystical because it has witches and magical swords in it. It's the story of 47 Ronin that are trying to restore the honor of their dead master. FYI: a Ronin is a Samurai without a master. The story starts with Keanu, as a young boy. He is running through the forest and he is found by Hiroyuki, a Samurai, hunting in the woods with his master. They take Keanu into their clan and train him, although some of the other Samurai do not approve-they call him a half-breed. Ko is the daughter of the Samurai and she takes a liking to Keanu, also not approved by the others. Cary plays the big Shogun that wants to take over all the neighboring lands and after a certain witch stirs up trouble, Keanu's master is put to death. The 47 Ronin now have a mission to restore their honor and the honor of their dead master. There are some good special effects and lots of sword fighting scenes, but the ending is a little different, but it is staying in character with the duty and honor of a Samurai. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",47 Ronin

Let's face it, the samurai are lucky to have lasted as long as they did, with their continual mass suicides. Furthermore, there are not now (and never have been) ""witches"" who could turn themselves into 140-foot flying dragons. If samurai moms read baby samurai stories about such fantasies, that's one thing. But if grown men slaughtered each other over such Saki-induced nonsense (when they were not busy committing ritual suicide), then that's another. Where were their nut houses and insane asylums, where such as these could be safely confined before their delusions became contagious? All the top Japanese military leaders involved with WWII admitted then and later that they knew their country was doomed on Pearl Harbor Day. What is it about this culture that makes it so hell-bent on self-destruction? I'm afraid watching 47 RONIN won't bring much enlightenment!",47 Ronin

46,estebangonzalez10,More like 1 and a half Ronin,4,27 March 2014,"""I will search for you through 1000 worlds and 10000 lifetimes!""If it weren't for the title I would have never guessed this film was about 47 Ronin (47 disgraced samurais who have failed their master), because we barely get some character development from two of them (and one technically isn't a ronin). The rest of the Ronin are simply placed in the background for the action scenes, but they are completely ignored. Something similar happened in 300, but at least that film had incredible action scenes and a memorable lead performance from Gerard Butler who engaged its audience. It's not the case here with Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada who fail to draw us into their world. This hurts the action scenes because we never really care for the outcome of these men. When I first saw the poster for 47 Ronin I thought this might be a cool movie, but when I watched the trailer I dropped any expectations I might've had. Not even the cool looking villains in the poster had much screen time and every single character in this film is one dimensional. This was a very dull fantasy film despite its subject matter and its two hour runtime began to take its toll on me considering it was very poorly paced. The film begins with a prologue, setting up the action, but I really don't know when the prologue ended and when the actual story began because it took forever to set up the plot. It's a shame this film was so poorly realized because first time director, Carl Rinsch, was given a huge budget to work with. Despite the gorgeous landscape there was nothing extraordinary about the action scenes and this is one of those movies that will be quickly forgotten.Screenwriters Chris Morgan (from the Fast and Furious franchise) and Hossein Amini (Drive) based this screenplay on one of Japan's most endearing folktales. The story begins with a prologue explaining the code of the samurai and the feudal situation of ancient Japan. Then we are introduced to Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) of Ako who finds a young half-breed named Kai in the forest and takes him back home. Several years later, Kai (Keanu Reeves), who is now a grown man, continues to serve under Lord Asano helping the samurai led by Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) protect Ako from mystic creatures. While hosting a tournament, as a welcoming for the Shogun in Ako, Lord Asano is bewitched into hurting Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) of Nagato. Lord Asano didn't realize his actions were induced by a Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) who was on Lord Kira's side, and he is forced to take his own life by the Shogun. The samurais are punished and disgraced to live as ronin outside of Ako and Kai is sold as a slave, while Lord Kira is named ruler of Ako. In order to restore their honor, Kai and the disgraced samurais embark on a dangerous quest to avenge their master's death.I'm sorry if the plot description feels a bit rushed and all over the place but that was just the way everything was presented in this film. The characters are one dimensional and the plot simply moves from one sequence to the next without feeling cohesive. This is perhaps why I felt the pace was so tedious because we never get any time to actually get to know any of the characters or their motivations. It doesn't matter how beautiful the landscape or set pieces were, the action scenes simply didn't engage me. Everything about this film felt uninspired and dull. 47 Ronin is a disgrace to Japan's classic legend and I'm sure nobody back home is proud of this film. The critic for Newsday, Rafer Guzman, described this film so well I feel the need to quote him: ""47 Ronin would have been more fun if it kept swinging its sword instead of falling on it."" Skip this movie, it's not as cool as the poster makes you believe it is.",47 Ronin
47,Fluke_Skywalker,Fails with honor,6,14 May 2014,"'47 Ronin' has the feel of a project that had a few too many studio chefs in the kitchen trying to turn this potluck stew of a movie into a gourmet film. Like its star, Keanu Reeves, it's stoic and clunky, but also fiercely sincere in its efforts, and perhaps by osmosis, it has a certain dignity to it. Visually, it's fairly impressive, even dazzling at times, with action that's over-stylized, but never the less well choreographed and easy to follow.Unfortunately, the approach they took with Reeves' character robbed the film of one of its strongest dramatic arcs, and the love story sizzles with all the heat of a wet firecracker.In the end, '47 Ronin' is passable fantasy fare, and nothing more.",47 Ronin

50,kluseba,An epic fantasy movie about a legendary tale of Japanese culture,8,17 January 2014,"""47 Ronin"" is a vivid fantasy movie that retells a famous legend in ancient Japan when forty-seven Ronin went out to avenge their master who had to commit suicide after a series of conspiracies and unlucky events. Of course, this movie has some historical inaccuracies but that's not an issue. This colourful tale should please to anybody who cares about Japanese culture in particular or epic fantasy movies in general.What I liked about the movie is that nearly all actors are still Japanese and actually have accents as well. Keanu Reeves is playing one of the leading roles but to my positive surprise, he doesn't take too much space and fits very well into this story. This is a lot more authentic than ""The Last Samurai"" with Tom Cruise for example. In general, the acting in here is very well done. The movie features moments of anger, defeat, despair, guilt, humour, jealousy, loyalty, romance, sadness and victory and all these emotions are captured very well by the actors.The characters in the movie are also quite diversified even though a little bit stereotypical. From the brave leader of the Ronin over the permanently jealous samurai and its rejected half-breed brother in arms to the arrogant villain who gets supported by a beautiful witch and a mysterious Lovecraftian samurai, the viewers are introduced to many epic characters.The movie also convinces with great settings, light and visual effects. The three-dimensional version is worth watching and has some spectacular moments. The places shown in this movie from the slave market over the haunted forest and the creeping temple to the villain's residence in the mountains are intriguing and mysterious.The story itself is rather simplistic and easy to follow but the philosophical topic of honour which is this movie's guiding line is an interesting an typically Japanese topic and offers some food for thought.Even though this movie doesn't innovate the action or adventure genre, this cinematic odyssey was highly entertaining from my point of view. I can't find any major flaws in here either. From an objective point of view, seven points are appropriate for this movie that is really worth to be experienced in cinema. It's due to my particular interest in ancient Asian cultures that this movie got me even more addicted and that's why I'm ultimately adding one more point. If you're intrigued by my review, you will also be by this film.",47 Ronin
51,3xHCCH,Loyalty and Honor,7,9 January 2014,"Loyalty and honor in Japanese culture had been very elegantly presented in many films about the Shogunate or feudal period of their history. I had always admired the nobility of their Bushido way of Samurai life, from watching films like my personal favorite ""Ran"", to more modern interpretations of the swordsman culture, like ""Ruruoni Kenshin."" I think ""47 Ronin"" will be joining that list.Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is the master of the prosperous house of Ako. A rival master, Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano), caused Asano to commit an act of assault by inflicting him with a spell care of his personal Witch (Rinko Kikuchi). The Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) meted Asano the sentence of seppuku, rendering his band of Samurai led by the loyal Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) as Ronin.Ronin are Samurai who have lost their master. The title ""47 Ronin"" refer to this group of ex-Samurai who reunite to avenge the dishonor and death of their master. Among these Ronin is an half-breed of remarkable fighting skills named Kai (Keanu Reeves). Despite being considered an outcast because of his skin, Kai's own mystical past will play an instrumental role in their plan for revenge.This film's story is very well-told by director Carl Rinsch from a screenplay by Chris Morgan and Hossein Amini. The cinematography was absolutely impressive with its sweeping vistas as well as intimate close-ups. The production design spared no expense it seems for very elegant set pieces, from rock gardens to ceremonial grounds. The costumes by Penny Rose deserve award consideration with their elaborate designs and rich detail. Striking colors of red, gold and navy delineate the clothes worn by the three different armies in the film. Smart modern touches touch up the gowns worn by the two main female characters in the cast. Keanu Reeves does well in his role as Kai, though I would have expected a younger actor to play the role. The main brunt of the acting though was on the shoulders of Hiroyuki Sanada, who played the lead Samurai Oishi. His screen presence was very strong and his performance was imbued with dignity. Oscar nominee Rinko Kikuchi chews up her every scene as the Witch, as she gets to interact with a lot of the film's computer-generated special effects. Ko Shibasaki graces the screen with her ethereal beauty and refinement as Miko, Asano's regal daughter, who had a forbidden love complicated by an unwanted betrothal decreed by the Shogun.Overall, I thought this was a very satisfying total movie experience, where you get transported to an exotic time in history when loyalty and honor, virtues so rare in this day and age, still ruled. The writing, technical and acting aspects all contribute to a visually vivid and emotionally moving film, albeit a Westernized fantasy with relatively lighter-weight treatment than the Kurosawa classics. Nevertheless, it does just fine for me.",47 Ronin
52,aharmas,Good Old Fashoned Samurai Fun,9,26 December 2013,"I remember getting excited when I saw the previews for this film, and I was hoping it would be good. Lately I heard rumors that it was a bomb, that it wasn't good, and my heart sank. Guess what? It looks like the critics are looking for their ""Lone Ranger"" for the season, which only means this is a good movie that's getting an unfair bad rap. I saw it today, and the film delivered in every possible way: It's a big production, great action, good acting, and very cool special effects.An outsider is allowed to stay in a Samurai community, falls in love with an unattainable member of the upper classes and because of his background, he's treated a second class citizen, usually being the target of offensive remarks and unfair practices. His good character helps him endure this difficult life, and the situation doesn't improve when a member of the royal family comes to visit his community. Because of a misunderstanding and the underhanded maneuvers of a witch, the community members and him find themselves in real trouble.There is a lot of action in the whole movie, and some of the dark magic stuff is fun to see. This is a film when the villain is well defined and works really well because she's a malevolent individual, with a pretty nasty agenda and a good arsenal of devilish spells. In addition to that, the fights are well choreographed, the action moves fast, and there's attention paid to some of the traditions of the Samurai culture (not sure if it's accurate), but the great art direction and beautiful photography give it a sense of reality.Be prepared not to listen to the credit and enjoy yourself.",47 Ronin
53,peterp-450-298716,I don't get the negativism about this one ...,7,6 April 2014,"I see only samurai before me.After reading some reviews about ""47 Ronin"", I expected a terrible Hollywood attempt to make a film about a Japanese legend. In the international press, the movie has been mercilessly, how appropriate, put to the sword. Some of the jargon on ""Rotten Tomatoes"" : cloddish, dour, tedious to watch, a funeral march, humorless as your junior high principal, as Japanese as a grocery-store California roll, Keanu Reeves looks as miserable and bored as the audience ... "". And it goes on like this. The 13% score is in that case logical. It's obvious that Keanu Reeves is seen as unsuitable for this role as a samurai.Well then there is something wrong with me, cause I didn't really saw it that way. Personally, I have a feeling that this is just another exaggerated hassle and rabble rousing in a negative way. ""Gravity"" was praised by the experts and overwhelmed with Oscar nominations (erroneously , except for the technical part of course). ""47 Ronan "" in contrast gets the full load and then got slated.On 3 February 1982, there appeared in the weekly magazine ""Spirou "" a new comic hero, Kogaratsu, a samurai who became a ronin, made by Michetz . On the front page it said « Kogaratsu , a comic like you've never seen before ... "". Since the 70s , I am an avid reader of this magazine, and have therefore read the first episodes with growing amazement. It was a totally different way of approaching a comic and I also devoured these stories . What was so unique about this comic besides the style ? That was the introduction to a unique Japan : the traditions and customs that surprises us western people, the loyalty, the honor, the calmness and serenity, the rituals, the mystical and magical atmosphere. All contained in this comic, and to be honest, I thought that was also present in ""47 Ronin"" .This action-adventure film went on for two hours and was finished before I knew it. Kai (Reeves) is a half-breed, half-Japanese, half-British, which was found by Lord Asano in the woods. Asano took him under his wing. However, Kai was never fully respected and ostracized by the other samurai led by Oishi. One day their master Asano is sentenced to death by the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi and the samurai are banished and became ronin. Kai is removed and sold as a slave. Eventually these samurai take revenge with the help of Kai for what was done to their master.Keanu Reeves actually did a great job playing the role of Kai. He looks a bit Asian and he also has the right appearance. Reeves really has such an apathetic and emotionless facial expression. But most Japanese people also have that look, so he fits very well in between those other samurai. Besides, Tom Cruise already played such a part as samurai in ""The Last Samurai"". And to be honest, I really think Cruise wasn't suitable for that. That the Japanese are speaking a flawed (although not as flawed as stated) stuttering English, didn't bother me. You can enumerate many WWII movies where the Germans always speak English with a greasy dialect. Or even more recent in the movie ""The Family"", where an entire village in France speaks flawless English. You can be certain this was a commercial decision to keep it English and ask Keanu for the title role.The film has a variety of beautiful images of nature and the community where Kai resides. Smooth action and battle scenes with other samurai, mythical creatures and magical characters. And a lovely surrounding with lavish and colorful settings and costumes. Various times we are treated with stunning digital effects. The orange-colored monster with six eyes and an immensely dangerous swishing tail. The witch Mizuki who repeatedly changed form, moving around like a flapping garment and adorned with Medusa-like winding tresses. The most successful effect was the low hanging clouds which formed human figures. The test the samurai had to undergo in the forest Tengu was pretty exciting. The grand finale is the storming of the palace of Kira.An underrated action movie mixed with elements of a fantasy. I was afraid that Reeves would look like a Japanese ""Neo"", but it turned out better than I thought . A wonderfully successful film for me.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",47 Ronin

On top of everything, the worst part of this movie by far, is the choice of director Carl Rinsch to have a Japanese story and Japanese characters speak ....you guessed it...English. Horrible decision. Movie starts off at a 6/10 to start with that - Japanese actors are clearly hobbled by this all to accommodate Keanu Reeves - the only native English speaker in the top 20 billets.

The Shogun (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) orders Lord Asano to commit Seppuku (Hari Kari) for his attempted murder of Lord Kira. The Samurai under Lord Asano are disgraced by the Shogun and are now called Ronin, those who didn't protect their Lord and now are considered Outcasts. The Ronin leave but vow revenge among themselves. Yes, you needed all the above. I didn't realize how good this movie would be. I thought ""here we go again"" with a story line that was hard to follow and fighting, fighting and more fighting and mostly in darkened scenes, sub-titles and names we would have a hard time remembering. I was wrong. This is a good story and is based upon true events back in Japanese Samurai culture. What makes this good is that we see a lot of color, fantastic cinematography, good dialogues, and excellent acting performances by all the cast, plus all Samurai stories deal with honor whether misguided or true. When Kai lived in Lord Asano's castle he fell in love with Asano's daughter, Mika (Ko Shibasaki). You know he is going to help the Ronin, but will forever long for Mika. We wish him well. We get to see some magic (you mean CGI, right?) and it is fantastic and you - okay, I – actually believed it was all real. Kudos. The fight scenes don't go on forever and are artfully done. There are no sub-titles and that was a break although we wouldn't have minded some Japanese language along the way. I am sure many don't give Keanu Reeves much acting credit and they would, of course, be very wrong. Try to recite his lines and see how you do, and don't forget about the stare. He's good at it. I have high praise for his performances. Again, try some of his lines (and stare) and see how you do.The ending may surprise you as it did me, but this is a true story and all actually happened (check Wikipedia). Again, I didn't fully realize how good this movie would be and it is excellent. It has the feel of an epic blockbuster.. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",47 Ronin
57,moviexclusive,"Yet another misguided Hollywood 'samurai' movie, this hodgepodge of legend and fantasy is a culturally blind product that provides for big-budget spectacle and little more",4,19 December 2013,"Hollywood's fascination with the way of the samurai continues with the latest East-West hodgepodge '47 Ronin', based on the Japanese legend of 47 brave warriors who went against the explicit orders of their Emperor to avenge the wrongful death of their master and later went on to sacrifice their lives in strict adherence to the code of the 'Bushido'. As the end credits will inform you, it is an occasion celebrated by thousands of Japanese till today on the 14th of December, but the fact that the Japanese themselves rejected this retelling of that story should be fair warning just how much credit to give it.To say that it is uninspired is pretty much an understatement, as commercials director Carl Rinsch betrays his lack of feature filmmaking experience with a tonally deaf movie that fails to engage on so many levels. The fault isn't entirely his; right from the start, one already senses something amiss in Chris Morgan and Hossein Amini's script. Venerable screenwriters though both are (Morgan's written one of our most favoured movies this year, 'Rush'), it is too obvious from the prologue alone that both are straining too hard for the movie to be taken seriously - and the reason for that becomes apparent just a short while later.It doesn't take a history scholar to enlighten you that Keanu Reeves' character is entirely fictional. A half-British, half-Japanese orphan named Kai who is taken in by the respected Lord Asano (Min Tanaka), its addition has no other purpose than to make the story more palatable for a Western audience. Indeed, short of being ostracised and called a 'half-breed', Kai spends most of his time moping around like most other characters Reeves does, so much so that you probably won't lose much if Kai had been swapped with a fully Japanese character as the legend must have gone.That's the equivalent of what happens during the course of the movie in fact. While it does seem as if Kai were the centre of the storytelling, Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada's stoic Oishi gradually but surely becomes the subject of the writers' interest and attention. As Lord Asano's son, Oishi grows into the leader of the resistance against Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano), who had dispatched his shape and form-shifting witch Mizuki (Rinko Kikuchi) to do his dirty work in framing Asano for his own attempted murder.It is Oishi who will lead the titular warriors - including Kai - in a sneak attack against Kira and whose inner emotional struggles, especially in knowingly leading his band of men to sure and certain death whether at Kira's hands or that of the Emperor, seems much more engaging than that of an outsider (which we may emphasise again was never part of the true story anyways) struggling to fit in. But even with choosing to place the emphasis on Oishi, the characterisation here for what should be a character-driven tale of heroism and sacrifice is too weak - and it certainly doesn't help that the lines the characters are given are either stilted or cringe-worthy or both.On his part, Rinsch does manage some nicely done action sequences. Oishi's ambush of Kira in his own kingdom towards the end is one, boasting of a nice buildup as the former's men stealthily take up key positions from which to spring their surprise on the enemy. That climax also culminates in Kai's showdown with Mizuki at the same time as Oishi's pursuit of Kira, and the intercutting between the two makes for a pretty exciting time. Rinsch's eye for good visuals is also plainly evident here; unfortunately the same can also be said of his poor grasp of pacing and tone.As if unsure whether to go all out to make a B-action movie or to attempt something more self-respectable, Rinsch ends up with a product that is neither weighty enough to be taken seriously (can you imagine Kai or Mizuki as the real deal?) nor weird and wonderful enough to be nothing more than an elaborate CGI Hollywood fantasy in and of itself. There is no hiding the fact that Rinsch tries too hard for the former, engineering not only unintentional moments of levity but rendering purposeful ones - like one where Kai demonstrates to one of his fellow ronin the difference between a sharp and blunt blade in slicing through wood - out of place with the rest of the movie. The same can be said of Reeves, who sticks out like a sore thumb next to the rest of the Japanese cast. It is both his character as well as the actor himself, the latter's trademark stone-faced act largely incompatible with the minimalist and nuanced acting of his Eastern counterparts. In contrast, Sanada shines in the role of Oishi, portraying with clarity and poignancy the dilemma his character faces in choosing the path that disobeys the Shogun and ultimately casts him, his men and their family into disrepute. Not one of the rest of the cast is given much opportunity to act though, and even Kikuchi is wasted in the role of a fox spirit that well calls her to be foxy and little more.And so despite its good intentions of illuminating the way of the samurai to the world, Hollywood once again fumbles with its Westernised take of what has been and perhaps will always remain a fundamentally Asian story best told by its own people. Except for big-budget spectacle, there is hardly any merit to this fantastical retelling of the honour and bravery displayed by the legendary '47 ronin'. It's no wonder then that the Japanese have patently rejected this Hollywood bastardisation, and unless you are prepared to be culturally blind, you're most likely to do likewise.",47 Ronin
58,quincytheodore,Pretty visual can't save this shallow uninteresting misuse of Japanese classic.,4,25 December 2013,"The tale of 47 Ronin is an ancient one, embellished with honorable vengeance in an exotic setting. While such premise could draw people attention, but there also lies its weakness, it's severely predictable. Many have used simple already known concept and made it into fresh interesting watch, unfortunately for this movie spamming CG is not amongst the way to accomplish that. Hindered by poor acting, questionable cast and uneven storytelling, 47 Ronin feels detached and uninspiring despite its gorgeous visual.From graphical standpoint, it's actually quite impressive. Mythical creatures roam its vibrant realm, colors are brightly sleek and the dark contrast makes for a good view. It's certainly up to par on other fantasy movies, although it does detract from more historical portrayal of feudal Japan. There's a bit exaggeration in it as well, almost as if it's a westernized version of Japan. Some scenes, especially with the quick battles or bizarre giant characters, have the grayish murky tone of medieval fantasy like The Hobbits, and while the style direction is a bit excessive, seeing kimono in brimming flamboyant dye is rather peculiar, it's acceptably eye pleasing.Problems emerge when it tries to implement the story, which could be inspirational but remarkably falls flat. Keanu Reeves plays Kai, a half breed from an Englishman and a Japanese woman, the film's original character meant to portray an elevating underdog story, yet Reeves displays only one set of facial expression. He looks almost completely the same throughout the movie, there's barely any allure on seeing such monotonous hero. At the very least, his stiff performance can be considered as consistency, ironically so.The use of English is awkward as well, The Last Samurai did the multilingual tone and it worked, so it could have used Japanese for more authenticity. There's a nagging feeling that something is amiss, specifically when the movie enters supposedly dramatic moments. Setting that aside, the script isn't exactly great either, most of the time it goes overly melodramatic, as if it wants the archaic feel of Japanese classic but delivered in mediocre English.Casting is dubious, everyone has the samurai look and with boorish script, everyone is equally trapped in their respective dull role; there's your serious samurai and next to him are the sad samurai and funny samurai. Granted, there's not enough time to highlight them all, but none of them stand out or have the chance to perform to the fullest. Rinko Kikuchi, who earned Oscar and Golden Globe nomination for Babel, plays the evil witch, although her presence merely resembles a bitter high school cheerleader. The characters are just terribly shallow, when the leading male barely does robotic mumbles and the Oscar nominee looks that uncomfortable, it does nothing to draw the audience's interest.During the two hours of its length, the flow feels fragmented, mainly because it consists of drab scenes with little beautiful vista sprinkled in between. There is no epic scale engaging skirmish to behold, just some small CG fights, which is odd since the appeal should be a smaller group of warriors against mightier force. It does boast a spectacle, but no amount of cosmetic can justify the bland use of Japanese classic.Rate 4/10",47 Ronin
59,OJT,The producers of 47 Ronin wants to much,3,10 January 2014,"This is not the kind of movie I usually would go to see, but since it premiered and was telling an exciting story about the classic 47 Ronin who took revenge on a court official who had the 47's leader commit seppuku, I gave it a chance,, though I knew there was a lot of adventure and fiction put into it.Keanu Reeves portrays Kai, a half-British Half-Japanese ""halfbreed"" who is called upon by Oishi, the leader of the 47, who wants to revenge the killing of their master.The acting is as you would expect not candid, but open, but I'm troubling with that everything is too obvious. Every look, every sentence. It's too much, and ends up in bad acting. Too bad, since there's so many great Japanse actors here.I get a feeling that the producers has had too large ambitions here, to make a crowd-pleaser, and tried to make a samurai movie, as well as making Lord of the Rings, and a Viking movie and even with a touch of Avatar with a costume drama as well. The film is pretty when it comes to costumes and nature, and filming, but I'm afraid the story fails to engage. It's simply too long and also boring.The last 20 minutes the film is picking up. This is worth watching, hence the three stars. But I'm afraid I started thinking about everything else, while in the theater, and that's not the reason I go there.",47 Ronin

61,Troy_Campbell,A fun B-grade mess.,6,18 January 2014,"Martial arts meets mythical monsters – what could be more fun? Well, a faster paced, more light- hearted movie to begin with. Director Carl Rinsch's debut feature film is an ambitious mess plagued by a plodding narrative, horrendous dialogue and an energy-sapping, serious tone. Yet despite it's many flaws – including Rinko Kikuchi's embarrassingly hammy Witch – 47 Ronin has flashes of awesomeness. The set piece with a murderous pack of otherworldly monks is spectacular, an early scene with a magical spider is gloriously shot and the climactic takeover of a castle by the eponymous warriors is exhilarating with its stealth and grace. Kikuchi aside the acting is solid, with Keanu Reeves the lone Westerner among a collection of high-calibre Eastern talent including Tadanobu Asano, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and the massively underrated (on Western shores at least) Hiroyuki Sanada. Not brilliant by any stretch, and not deserving of a cinematic viewing, however once on DVD this could be the ideal B-grade flick for a lazy Sunday arvo.",47 Ronin

63,thekarmicnomad,Rashomon meets Krull,6,18 June 2014,"I didn't have a lot of faith in this film, but I warmed to it quickly especially when the super natural elements came in to play.Most of the cast was great and the film quickly sets up a framework for an intriguing tale. With this framework in place you can sit back and enjoy the plot unfold. Except you can't.This film feels very long. It feels like it is tying to be a an Akira Kurosawa film. Unfortunately it can't summon the Kurosawa magic that makes an old man sitting in the rain seem interesting. However, with some patience, you can still enjoy the feudal Japan setting and the goings on.Now it is obvious good guys are going to go here do x, y and Z with plenty of head chopping. Great! Except we're an hour in and not on our way yet.The guys go and get some swords, and some directions, and some sandwiches and other side quests that are just distracting.For some reason the tidy plot is purposely ripped to shreds. Sitting around with their faces in their rice bowls one guy will suddenly bring up some fact he didn't find poignant until now; like he is the greatest swordsman in the world but a bit shy about it.The film ends up being unnecessarily messy and very, very long.I like certain Keanu Reeves film. But he cannot act. Full stop. He had about 50 lines in this which was about 20 too many.Not a bad watch, and if you fancy something that goes off-piste a bit and you are a fan of Samurai movies then this could be for you. I liked it but wished it could have been a bit more and a bit less.",47 Ronin
64,phubbs,47 Ronin,8,30 March 2014,"So what's going on with Keanu Reeves these days huh? he seems to have taken a shine to the Far East recently what with this and 'Man of Tai Chi'. Problem is Mr Reeves keeps sticking himself in these films which just doesn't work, sorry Mr Reeves but you're not a good enough actor face it.Ah the legendary tale of the 47 Ronin, this film is very very very loosely based around this Japanese story of honour. The real origins are much simpler in truth, in the early 17th Century a Daimyo (Territorial Lord) called Asano attacked a high ranking Edo official called Kira. The reason was simply down to the fact that Kira had been rude to Asano and Kira was possibly corrupt which also offended Asano. So basically there was a scuffle which one could say was childish, but because of this Asano was ordered to commit seppuku. You can't go around attacking important Shogun officials willy-nilly.So now we have the classic tale of the 47 Ronin...the Hollywood version, hurrah!. The film follows the basic premise of the old story but uses artistic license heavily and thick highly stylised visuals. Yep, this is '300' for feudal Japan (Edo period). The visuals are clearly influenced by that Greek Spartan battle porn flick, I thought the film was a more historically accurate take...got that wrong!. Admittedly most of the creatures we see are the result of sorcery by this naughty female witch but there is a huge armour clad uber Samurai, a big ogre/troll guy, some weird spiritual bird-faced monks and some massive half dragon half horse with antlers type thing at the start.I can't lie to you, I flippin' loved the visual style of the film. Maybe we could of done without the monsters and freaks as they didn't really add anything to the plot other than fancy flair. Would of been fine without the magical hocus pocus too but unfortunately that is all tied in with the new plot. All the fantasy aside the actual realistic Japanese period costumes, weapons and sets are all expertly created and beautiful to look at. The ceremonial sequences at the start are truly stunning, bold and colourful, while the sets look pretty accurate to me. Its all topped off with some well created CGI landscapes and skylines.Plot queries...apparently Reeves character was raised in some spooky woods by the bird-faced monks, who are apparently demons. Not overly sure why they would do that, they also trained him to be a bloody good katana fighter, although again not too sure why they would do that, how does it benefit them? oh and why do they look the way they do?. Other things stood out to me also, for example, when 'Oishi' is getting his samurai back together for his revenge mission he finds Reeves character first. But why? he clearly doesn't like the guy as we saw for the whole film right up to that point, also Reeves character isn't a samurai so why would he even think of him, this whole issue has nothing to do with Reeves character. Its about the 47 Ronin, not 47 Ronin and one outcast along for the ride.Another thing I don't get was the abundant advertising of Rick Genest's face all over the posters (guy covered in tattoos). I kinda got the impression this bloke was a main character in the film yet he does nothing and shows up for less than a minute. I'm guessing whatever he did was cut out.I'm not gonna beat around the bush here, I really liked this film. It has its problems but as far as I'm concerned they are easily overlooked by the tremendously sumptuous visuals, solid acting from the Japanese cast and the kick ass battle sequences. Yep if you wanna see some samurai action that other films like 'The Last Samurai' didn't quite deliver on then this is for you. There isn't any blood and gore on display but the sword battles are awesome and most of the time not spoilt by CGI silliness. For the most part everything seems to have been kept as relatively historically accurate as possible, its just bits here and there...which does beg the question why but anyway.In all honesty there are many little niggly bits that could be pointed out, I get the feeling they really struggled to incorporate the fantasy element they wanted into this historic event. But lets not allow that to dampen our oriental spirits here. Yes the film blatantly pinches ideas from various films like '300' 'The Matrix' and even 'The Empire Strikes Back' with the sequence where the good guys must enter a sacred spooky wood to face an unknown force...of sorts. It does feel like they're totally jumpin' on the 300 franchise bandwagon mainly and as I've said it does feel a bit unnecessary. Never the less I did enjoy the film thoroughly. My love of Japanese culture will make me somewhat biased of course but anyone who likes this new blend of history and slick glossy stylised action should enjoy this.8.5/10",47 Ronin

68,joebloggscity,47 Ronin is 47 too many in this poor film....,3,30 December 2013,"If film producers surely wish to make a successful cross-cultural flashy epics then surely they could sacrifice some budget on better script writers. This film is a travesty.Taking a local legendary tale set in Japan (and then discarding the whole story to replace it with a lot of hokum and a misplaced US actor), the producers have tried hard it seems to ensure it all goes wrong. The story involves old samurai traditions, clan warfare, witch craft, politics and revenge. Sounds epic but doesn't gel at all. If anything, they wanted a special effects epic and the rest just got in the way.I can't think of that much good I can say on this. Apart from the lady who plays the witch, all else appear uncomfortable and unable to work with the terrible dialogue, which is corny, clichéd and poorly delivered. Surely this would have worked better with a more seriously scripted dialogue that viewers could respect rather than the unnecessary melodramatic nonsense we are fed.I think they also should have just done the film in Japanese, and would have been better than what we have here. Just seems ill placed having it in English, and feels ridiculous. For some of the actors, working in English has meant they end up looking as wooden as Keanu Reeves has done in many of his roles in his career.As for the 3D, it is redundant and unnecessary. Granted a few good effects in this, but we're spoilt nowadays and this offers little memorable. The special effects in general are quality at times but aren't able to mask for the script's deficiencies. However, I can't see the point of the whole sorcery and creature effects.This is a shambles of a film, and deserves to fail miserably (and it has according to early reports). If it had any pretensions to be an international success like '13 Assassins' then really the producers hadn't paid due attention to that film properly. Avoid '47 Ronin', it's not worth watching even if free to air I'd say.",47 Ronin

I mean, the trailers looked great and exciting for the most part, but unfortunately, Universal Pictures didn't realize that the marketing for the film wasn't that good. Not to mention that it came out the same month as The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, which garnered more attention There are some good things about the film. The acting is fine for the most part. Keanu Reeves from The Matrix, Rinko Kikuchi from Pacific Rim, and everyone else involved did their best. The costumes are nice and there are some nice details, but there two of the best things about this film. Ilan Eshkeri, the guy who composed the score for Stardust, does a great job with his music here, using authentic Japanese violins, gives some scope to the film, and some really neat action cues. And then there's the visuals. John Mathieson, who did the cinematography for Ridley Scott's films including Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood, creates some of the best visuals for a live-action feature film. The landscapes, the forests, the mountains, and the medieval-like Japanese setting has some great detail. Oh, and the special effects are really neat too especially the dragon. Kudos to that.And now for the bad parts. I understand that it tries to be accurate to the historical event this was based on, but the only problem is, it takes itself way too seriously. The script is really stale, the dialog is really clichéd, the characters are one-dimensional and are really undeveloped, the writing is really terrible, and the pacing is really boring. Which is a shame, because the money for the production design was well-spent.Overall, 47 Ronin isn't exactly a terrible movie. It's really beautiful in it's production design, but it could've been so much better if they gave more believability to the characters and story.

72,Movie-Misfit,Not As Bad As They All Say..!,8,12 December 2019,"Its crazy to think that 47 Ronin is a (feature film) directorial debut for Carl Rinsch. He had only made a handful of shorts before this, so it was quite the project to step into Hollywood with... It makes me wonder just who these first time directors are sleeping with to get such huge projects. I myself have made 7 feature films, and I'm still waiting on an invite from the studio bosses in Tinseltown - but hey!So this fantasy filled movie is a Hollywood adaptation of a classic Japanese tale (and many movies) which in a sense means that, this fantasy filled movie is actually very loosely based on said story...This version features witches and giants, monsters and yokai, which isn't at all a bad thing. It also co-stars the great Hiroyuki Sanada and the gorgeous Jin Akanishi, which is always a good thing. Although a box office disappointment, 47 Ronin did well on home sales and is actually a very watchable movie that keeps things interesting, even with its long running time. The locations and sets are highly impressive and quite stunning to look at. The costumes are beautifully made and lavish, full of colour and enough authenticity that makes every extra dotted throughout, still look in place.While it tries to maintain that typical Japanese Samurai movie tempo with its paced story telling and long running time, the Hollywood side of it still likes to inject the odd burst of action or energy just so the Western audience doesn't get bored too quickly. But why would we with such rich visuals, decent CGI (with the odd tiny slip-up), great action and martial arts swordplay?I do believe that during shooting the dialogue was recorded in both Japanese and English. I for one would love to have seen this in its Japanese version, something I think would have aided the film greatly and made for a better experience overall. It would make sense that Kai (Reeves), who has been brought up from a young child by the Japanese, would end up speaking their language... But instead, this version would make you think he had taught the village - nay, the country - how to speak English!As probably one of the most visually impressive and action packed adaptations of the famed 47 Ronin story, its hard not to deny the movie its entertainment value. While just missing that little something special - perhaps something possibly achieved by a more seasoned director - the movie may have its flaws, but ultimately very few in the grand scheme of things...Overall: Neo Wick continues his journey as a Hollywood martial arts star in a film that does entertain on many levels, yet will never go down as a classic!",47 Ronin

Especially, as I only ever saw ""300"" on TV and was definitely not impressed.This movie, however, did impress me.In plot, it was the closest to the actual (translated) historical texts I've ever read on the subject. The character of Kai--played by Keanu Reeves--was, of course, dreamed up expressly for this film version. But, that was a plus, as far as I'm concerned. As I agree that purity of heart is definitely _not_ interchangeable with purity of genealogical descent!Plus, he helped introduce some elements of Japanese mythology which (let's face it) isn't as well known, to Western Hemisphere audiences, as Greek or Norse mythology. Stuff like the tengu folk often being depicted as Buddhist bird-men. Or that the kirin (the Japanese version of a Chinese dragon) often looked more like a rainbow-colored moose (aka Euro-elk)!In short; this movie was way better than I expected. So, all those who didn't go see it during Opening Week should make a New Year's resolution to go see it this week. It'll be worth it.",47 Ronin
74,Darkside-Reviewer,Very underwhelming and forgettable,4,3 November 2019,The story of the 47 Ronin has been depicted on the big screen a few times since as early as the fiftys this is the first big budget western movie interpretation of the famous story and while visually it looks impressive and sleek the movie is more a fantasy film than a samurai film adding in mythical creatures half breed demons and witches which sadly the movie focuses on way to heavily the plot is driven forward more by witchcraft and trickery than the will of the Ronin to avenge there lord which is sad to see as the movie would of been better if they had made this a realistic samurai movie based on the classic 47 Ronin story instead we get CGI dragons swords cutting fire in half a villain who is so weak and pathetic the final fight with him is less than a minute long but the CGI dragon fight gets over five minutes and the only time you see any blood is when they all sign a peice of cloth and leave a finger print you'd expect some blood from a movie with beheadings and sucide in it.There are a couple of fights during the movie but they are over before anything has a chance to happen the only time the 47 Ronin actually fight is in the last 20 minutes of the movie and most of that is just slow motion one hit cuts no real fighting and a ten minute CGI dragon fight that's about it the rest is dialogue exposition shots and Keanu Reeves being the whitest samurai ever put to film.Keanu Reeves should not of been in this movie his character is only there as part of the fantasy half demon half man storyline all he does is get in the way of everything and be the movies white guy in an otherwise all Asian cast the real lead in this movie is without a doubt (Hiroyuki Sanada) as Oishi Yoshio the samurai turned Ronin who sets out to avenge his lord and master the ruler of the AKO region who's death was unjust along with his fellow samurai turned Ronin the 47 Keanu Reeves character isn't even a samurai so he's not even part of the 47 Ronin he's useless all round and the movie would of been fine without him in it.I recommend watching this movie just for the laughs really it's nothing amazing or even memorable but it's an ok hour and a half time waster.,47 Ronin
75,Shopaholic35,It was OK.,5,16 November 2015,"I found this movie to be rather stupid. I mean, it wasn't terrible but it was all over the place. I don't believe they thought out the concept and I never really understood the point. It was rife with tradition which I understand but the characters were ignorant in their beliefs which annoyed me. With so much arrogance I don't know how they fit it all in one movie. If they weren't so selfish I may have cared.The reason why I didn't rate it lower was because thankfully it did start to pick up in the middle of the film. They started to get a little more personality and warmth and finally decided to grow a backbone. At least it finished better than it started.",47 Ronin

In a land so vibrant, and beautiful then devastated, and ruined. With the seed of truth that all legends must be born from, and I don't care what you say Keanu Reeves﻿ has always been on top in my book. This full and exciting adventure is filled with excellent acting, and a cast of pop culture icons popping up all over the place that make sure you are kept entertained from start to finish. I was surprisingly put off at first by the fact that this movie was in English, I got over it and the fact that they never attempt to address the issue does help in dismissing this. Don't expect anything like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, although the magical worlds could almost be interchangeable, (not considering one is China, and one Japan). Though that is where things seem to get the most culturally messed up, and this may be where most people get put out. I did however Enjoy this movie, it won me over in the action, and the acting, the sets were awful, but most of the exterior scenes were really beautiful. This cat recommends you watch this movie, there is no blood, what there is is just black gunk, and most real violence is played off camera in a very decent way that does not feel overacted, but feels more like a Kabuki style performance.",47 Ronin
77,dfa120374,Excellent Adaptation Of The 47 Ronin Story,9,18 January 2015,"Whilst out hunting in the forest, Lord Asano and his samurai find a young half-breed named Kai (Reeves) and take him back to their castle where he grows up being a servant. Several years later, Asano welcomes the Shogun of Japan where he and a rival Lord, Kira, hold a tournament in his honour. The following night, however, Asano is bewitched into hurting Kira and for his crime, Asano is punished by the Shogun into committing seppuku. Realizing that it was part of Kira's plan to take over the provinces of Asano, the former samurai warriors (now classed as ronin) set out for revenge albeit against the Shogun's orders.47 Ronin is an absolutely amazing film to watch and it's actually bewildering why it done pretty bad at the Box Office. If you're expecting an endless amount of action with little to no plot then move along as you will not like this movie.I have read reviews where people say that the CGI was ""awful"", ""weak"", ""overused and badly implemented"" and the movie was ""lame"" and ""just a fantasy freak show"". I know movies, like any other art form, are subjective to various audiences, but my response is that these people were just expecting some sort of mindless action movie with demons aplenty instead of a beautifully filmed ADAPTATION of the legend of the 47 ronin.Firstly, the CGI was anything BUT ""weak"" and ""overused""....in fact it could so easily have been a CGI-fest, like the awful Pacific Rim, but wasn't.Secondly, I have seen my fair share of ""lame"" movies...this is definitely not one of them. Everything about the movie captured my attention - the story, the fantastic CGI that does get used, the amazing photography & scenery, the great action scenes, and the overall look of the film that actually makes you feel you are watching a period in time from ancient Japanese history (which I have always been interested in).Don't pay attention to what the haters say because 47 Ronin is an absolute must watch.",47 Ronin
78,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,12 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""47 Ronin"" is a glamorized fictional telling of the real life account of 47 samurai who avenge their master's death in 18th century Japan. As a biopic, you could say this rendering is very loosely based on those historical events. As an action film, you could say it delivers the goods.It all begins when Asano Naganori, the lord of Ako is betrayed by witchery and trickery at the hands of Kira, another lord who is bent on dominating the land. Because of this, Asano is sentenced to death leaving his samurai followers scattered to the winds and his daughter under the control of Kira who has designs on forcing her into marriage with him. But her heart beats for Kai (Keanu Reeves),  who her father allowed to live under his rule though he is despised by all others. After Asano's death, Kai is sold into slavery. However, a year later, the samurai band together under the leadership of Oishi, Asano's best warrior. Oishi finds Kai and they devise a plan to avenge their fallen master and free the land of Ako from Kira's tyranny.This is a classic tale of revenge with a supernatural edge to it. As Kai, Keanu Reeves portrays the silent hero well. The love story underlying the overall plot was believable and all the performances by everyone involved was strong. Rinko Kikuchi sinks herself amazingly well into her role as Mizuki - the witch with eyes of two different colors. She was one of my personal favorite characters in the story. There are also some truly excellent visuals in this movie and the action scenes pull you in.It is a good film and I would recommend it to any action fan out there. I feel you would probably enjoy it. However, it fails to really drive home that winning punch that makes you want to turn right around and go see it again. Would I watch it again? Perhaps ... but the mood would have to strike me. Still, it gets a solid 7 stars out of 10 from me.",47 Ronin
79,cinematic_aficionado,"Good visuals, but rather shallow",5,31 December 2013,"The story of a group of fallen Samurai's and how they go against the rules to protect their honour.One must appreciate that in the era the film is set, people had to adhere to strict and inflexible behavioural codes. Everything depended on them, and obedience was blind.Whilst it boasts a good storyline, performances and visuals it falls short on achieving any significance. Part revenge story, part journey, and even a love story it touches upon several items without reaching any depth in any.It would have been a better experience if an extra hour was added to it story, to allow the narrative to unfold more properly.",47 Ronin
80,TheSquiss,"Feudal Japan beautifully coloured with honour, samurai, magic & daemons.",6,4 January 2014,"Much has been written about the acting (in)ability of Keanu Reeves, most of it unfair. Certainly he's no Daniel Day Lewis, but neither is he wallowing in the mire with Taylors Kitsch & Lautner. In 47 Ronin, Reeves is on fine form. He's intense, moody, gloomy and, were he an inanimate object or work of art, he might be referred to as 'atmospheric.' More to the point, 47 Ronin is by far his best film and personal work since The Matrix sometime waaaay back in the last century. Admittedly that isn't difficult but Carl Rinsch's cinematic directorial debut lifts a slice of Japanese history, mythologizes it, throws in a fantasy element of magic and daemons and ends up as a cross between House of Flying Daggers and John Carter. It's not a cocktail that is entirely successful but is far from a dull thud.When their master is dishonoured and forced to commit seppuku by a ruthless shogun, a band of ronin (masterless samurai) gather to avenge him, led by a man, Kai (Keanu Reeves) regarded as a halfling and saved as a child by the master. That's all you need to know. Unfortunately, if you watched the trailer, you'll already have seen the biggest 'reveal' that comes in the final act of 47 Ronin. When is Hollywood going to learn the long, detailed trailers that give away principal plot lines only succeed in winding up serious cinema-goers? But I digress. 47 Ronin is the lighter side of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that will appeal to a broader audience who enjoy a certain bloodlust beyond esoteric love stories but perhaps require more fantasy than the likes of The Last Samurai has to offer. On the whole, it works. 47 Ronin is a colourful, exciting film that captures the imagination and transports us to another time, another world, but I can't help thinking it would have been a braver and far more spectacular experience if Rinsch had had the balls to eschew the fantasy elements and concentrate to the legend that still holds an elevated place in the heart of Japan.Throughout 47 Ronin I found myself hankering for the discipline and the absolute honour of the samurai and feudal Japan. In that, at least, Rinsch has succeeded. The colours, though lacking the impact and contrast of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers, are enticing and draw us in to a world of danger and excitement. Whilst the personal denial in favour of honour might be alien to western audiences, Rinsch endeavours to stitch his film together with it, although not always successfully as the final scene of seppuku, completely devoid of assistants, attests.There are a few stumbles in direction as if Rinsch commenced with an idea, deviated along the way and then forgot to review his progress in the editing suite. In one clumsy moment of misplaced comic relief, Kai easily slices through a solid bough while a rotund ronin manages only to bounce his blade across the bark. Kai halfheartedly explains it is due to the power of the swords but nothing more is ever made of their mysterious power and so the moment sticks out as an awkward clunk.Reeves more than manages to carry the film, which will be essential for some western audiences who won't recognize a single other actor amongst the Japanese cast, even if there are frequent occasions when one could be forgiven for thinking Qui-Gon Jinn has wandered into feudal Japan. Star Wars references aside, the costumes are stunning and could fill an entire floor of a museum all on their own and still keep me interested. The scenery, likewise, is breathtaking and, unlike Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, it's mostly Japan's own work.47 Ronin won't go down in history as an all-time great, but in a couple of year's time when you stumble across it on the TV you'll wonder why the heck you didn't make the effort to see it on the big screen.",47 Ronin
81,RevRonster,Not bad but it could have been better...,4,23 April 2014,"This was one of those movies that I was kinda excited to see and willing to dish out the small loan needed to see in a theater but various circumstances involving stopping megalomaniac villains from taking over the world (you're welcome, by the way) ended up causing me to not see it and forcing me to wait for the DVD to come to my locale RedBox. After receiving my usual check for randomly dropping RedBox's name in a random review, I realized that, in the end, it didn't hurt to wait for ""47 Ronin."" The film isn't outright terrible but it sure didn't feel like it was really trying to shine either. While the cast is filled with terrific actors (and yes, I am including Keanu Reeves in that. Hate me all you want, I like the guy) and the story is really cool and given an extra dose of awesome by taking the real life legend and adding a little bit of fantasy to it with a witch that can turn into a dragon; however, the story has a very slow pace that, while not a deal breaker (slow paces don't necessarily equal bad movie) it did make the film feel like it was just trudging along and in no hurry to get to any point of conflict or any sort of exciting action.This dynamic is sort of mirrored in the cast as, despite it being filled with talented people (once again, I'm including Reeves in that), no one really seemed like they wanted to overdo it or, possibly, look like they were trying to steal the spotlight. Every actor feels like they are doing their best to NOT stand out and this ultimately made the experience feel like that moment when you and another person approach a door and are both offering for the other to go first and neither one of you are moving. All the actors gave performances like they were trying to let another actor be the focal point and, when it was all said and done, you have just an entire roster of actors looking like they are doing their best to not showcase their talent and are waiting for anyone else to lay claim to the spotlight.""47 Ronin"" wasn't terrible. It has a great cast, cool story and I loved the ending but the entire film felt like it wasted its potential and was going out of its way to not be exciting and intense and just felt like settling on ""meh.""

82,judywalker2,Worst movie ever,1,13 April 2014,"I rented this from Amazon, at first I was intrigued it looked somewhat interesting. But about fifteen minutes into the movie I just started laughing at the really ridiculous storyline, really bad acting and dialog. I really felt sorry for the cast having to say the stupid things that they were saying. Worse than all of that it was again a movie that is based on the notion that a white man has to save the native population i.e. Dances with Wolves, Avatar. When are we going to stop doing this. My God enough already. I really wish I knew the real story of the 47 Ronin I bet it is a really great tale and I hope to look it up and find out. Too bad the movie making didn't do that too.",47 Ronin
83,t_atzmueller,"If you'd ask the director what kind of film this is, don't be surprised if he'd answer: ""You tell me!""",4,26 September 2016,"If you, like me, have a heart for trash- and B-movies, I don't have to tell you that you simply cannot avoid films of a certain reputation, no matter how hard you try. It's like the old story with the flies and a heap of manure: there just is no helping it but to occasionally dive right in. And rarely does one get to see such a heap with such a price-tag.At the same time I had a little spark of hope left, which came in the shape of Hiroyuki Sanada. Sanada had worked hard for the past 40 years, transforming himself from a teen-heartthrob to a distinguishable actor (""Sunshine"", ""The Last Samurai""), having a gift for shining even in the occasional dud (""The Wolverine"", ""Rush Hour 3"") that he'll appear in. But I should have known better, that even actors armed with an army of Oscars would have little chance against the living mediocrity that is called Keanu Reeves.If you have a basic idea about what the historical story of the 47 Ronin is about, you'll know fully well that the half-caste character of Reeves has been dumped into the storyline like an infant into a virgin; utterly unnecessary and utterly pointless, for no other reason than having a Hollywood-name attached to the project. Speaking about virgins and infants: Reeves acting his way out of a paper-bag, now that would have been another biblical miracle. Like misery personified he drags himself through the picture and here I have to admit: I have not coined the term ""Prozac-Samurai"", though I often wish I had.As for the rest of this convoluted mess: Is it at least entertaining on a popcorn-level? I'd say, about 50/50. Perhaps it could have worked if the studio would have ""allowed"" the director to steer his project more toward the direction of historical epos. But those elements simply didn't sit well with a load of fantasy, dragons, Japanese demons and animated beasts. Take for example the scene at the ""Dutch colony"", which had the potential to be the visual highlight of the flick. Again, the producers had other plans for the audience, opting for a blend of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and a man-monster straight out of ""300"" thrown in for ""good measure"". This is also the scene with Rick Genest, better known as ""Zombie-Boy"", who is featured so prominently on the movies poster. Didn't clock it but his appearance should be around 10 – 15 seconds of screen-time, that add nothing to the storyline.So, is it a Samurai-epos, CGI-Fantasy-standard or simply template Hollywood-factory-fodder? Well, it does not only sit between those chairs, it falls straight through them. In essence this really ads up the whole mess: plenty of promises that generally remain empty, interrupted by some pretty visuals, a bore that had gone through editing-hell and a ""star"" that has outstayed his welcome for about 13 years. Every moment shows. 4/10 should not be too much.(And etymological trivia for the road: I have been told that, if I happened to dislike this movie or his ""star"" – which I obviously do – that makes me a ""hater"". It would appear that the word is used for anybody that disagrees with you or holds an opinion that differs from your own. So it's not a negative expression per se, but might indicates that you don't necessarily fall for any hype or have a disdain for mediocre productions).",47 Ronin

Does that not sound bad ass or what?Differentiating itself from the classic samurai film is its focus on a Lord of the Rings style fantasy to a famous Japanese tale. Using the big Hollywood magic that Keanu's name still brings in to make a special effects driven blockbuster. Noticeabily, the movie has a cast of well known Japanese faces like the old favorite typed cast villain, Carry-Hiroyuki Tagawa with a small role as the shogun, academy award nominee, Rinko Kikuchi who's following up her other Japanese flavored Hollywood blockbuster, Pacific Rim, and a fresh new face to Hollywood, Hiroyuki Sanada who's also following up from another Japanese inspired blockbuster, the Wolverine All I can say is, thank you Keanu for your great efforts to bring Asian cinema to an American market.

The best of them would be great in any language, and I've been able to enjoy the worst on their own terms, at least in part because subtitles reduce the risk of actors sounding portentous and inadvertently funny when the dialogue starts to get bogged down in the epic problem. Unfortunately 47 RONIN is an English-language picture. Bless his heart, Keanu Reeves, with his unchanging expression, his unwavering intensity and his über-seriousness, becomes increasingly difficult to take without a smile, especially when he utters the screenplay's extremely stiff and formal dialogue. It may be appropriate for the caste-ridden society in which the story is set, but it's leaden. Even Hiroyuki Sanada, who is a wonderful actor, has trouble making the lines sound like something someone might actually say. And the script rarely lets up. The tone is soporifically reverent pretty much all the way through.Proceedings only liven up when Rinko Kikuchi, as a slinky witch, appears. Hers is the one character allowed out of the constraints of hyper-formality. The special effects involved in her transformations are fun too.All in all, it's not a bad movie. It's not one to avoid, or anything like that. It's worthy, yes. Sometimes accidentally funny. It looks good, mostly. But on the whole, I'm sorry to say, it's dull.",47 Ronin
88,p-jonsson,Decent but not great fantasy/adventure movie.,6,10 August 2014,"I had some expectations on this movie. Samurai's, fantasy, magic etc Sounds good to me alright. Well, as it turned out after having watched it I feel that my expectations was not entirely fulfilled. It is a decent enough movie. Certainly enjoyable to watch. But it is, in my opinion, not a great move and I cannot give it more than an average okay rating.I have not read the original story which the movie is, supposedly, based nor seen any of the other 47 Ronin movies that have been made. Thus I did not really know what the story was except what was the public storyline nor do I know if the movie actually follows the original story in any great detail. The basic story in the movie is a good one though. Classic, simple and perhaps not very original but a good concept for making a good adventure movie.The movie is entertainingto an extent. There are plenty of nice scenes, action, special effects that all make the movie worthwhile to watch. The Japanese, samurai, setting is one that is not used very often in major movies except of course for a bunch of fairly ludicrous martial arts movies which cater for a rather limited audience and generally on a very low-budget.However, I never really felt much attachment to any of the characters. Even the half-breed, which are supposed to be the hero, never seemed to lift above the ordinary. The bad guy could have been any two-bit crook in a TV-show. The witch was a bit better but still rather meh. The Shogun at least provoked a bit of emotions but not in a good way. What an asshole! Not a shred of investigation when Lord Asano was bewitched. Just ""go kill yourself"". Then after the 47 Ronins had actually proved his innocence as well as proved themselves to be the most loyal and capable warriors around the dumb f-ck wants them killed because they disobeyed his orders which where total nonsense from the start. As a matter of fact, the ending dragged down the movie quite a lot for me.Still a movie worth watching but it could have been a lot better.",47 Ronin
89,xamtaro,Asian All-Stars in a western remake.,7,8 January 2014,"Ronin. They are masterless Samurai, cast out from their service. Free from the bonds of servitude, some become wanderers or mercenaries. But for 47 former samurai of the Asano clan, they continued to honor their dead master and carried out a final heroic act to avenge his death. This was a true story of loyalty and ancient bushido code of honor. From this historical tale came many retellings of the 47 Ronin. One of which was 2013's fantasy style adaptation starring Keanu Reeves.Wait....Keanu Reeves? Yes that Keanu Reeves. He stars as Kai in Universal studio's 47 Ronin. Kai is a mysterious half Caucasian half Japanese who was found as a boy on the outskirts of a tengu demon forest. He was taken in by lord Asano and allowed to serve the clan as a worker and hunting scout. Lo and behold, the lowly half breed finds a forbidden love in the Asano's daughter, Mika, and develops a friendship/rivalry with Oishi, the leader of Asano's samurai. But wait......what does all this have to do with the 47 Ronin? Well, it seems that rival clan led by lord Kira somehow gets his bitch witch to bewitch lord Asano into attacking Kira during a visit by a royal official. Japanese code of honor dictates that rather than finding out the cause if such an outburst, lord Asano has to commit ritual suicide to spare the honor of his clan while his Samurai stand by helplessly, as their interference is forbidden by that code of honor as well. As compensation, Kira takes Mika as his bride and everything that used to belong to Asano. Rather than serve Kira, 47 of Asano's warriors leave to become Ronin and plot their revenge for this grave injustice.Oh but what about Kai? Demon Tengu? A witch you say? Yes 47 Ronin digs deep into eastern mythology of dragons, witches, bird demons and magic to deliver something less like a historical epic and more like graphic novel. 47 Romin Feels like 3 separate stories cobbled together. The most interesting revenge plot and the development of the ronin as a cohesive team is muddled in Kai's cliché ridden romance and a whole lot of demon sorcery, monsters and special powers right out of some fan-manga. It is jarring when the tone shifts and the film switches it's focus. One moment, it is on Oishi and his quest to reunite the Ronin, the other it's on Kai and his continual pinning for the princess. Thanks to all this, we never fully realise just HOW loyal and united the 47 Ronin are other than being told so. We never delve into their group dynamic, into the spirit of brotherhood that held them together despite the crushing defeat they suffered.Despite weak writing and clichéd scripting by FAST AND FURIOUS write Chris Morgan, the majority of the Asian cast members do a spectacular job. This is essentially an all star ensemble for anyone into Japanese movie stars. Although filmed in English, the Asian stars emote with pure professionalism bringing genuine emotion to every scene. There is chemistry between the actors. Of particular note is Kou Shibasaki whose beautiful regal presence plays of spectacularly against Rinko Kikuchi's sultry slutty witch Mizuki. Arguably, Keanu Reeves' wooden performance also plays in good contrast to the Japanese characters, only to further highlight his alien nature.Whether he is miscast or not truly depends on what you expect for the character. But none can be as out of his element than First time director Carl Erik Rinsch. Filmed in 3D, the director schizophrenically alternates between smooth wide shots that benefit realty from the medium to tight frantic close ups that utterly wastes the 3D format. Action is passable but no where as epic as it could have been filmed. Overall, despite astounding visual effects and flawless CGI, the unremarkable directing makes the film feel neutered and generic. Generic too is the movie soundtrack by Ilan Eshkeri. Having composed with a distinct Asian touch for films like NINJA ASSASSIN, that same Asian touch is sadly missing from 47 Ronin. It is run-of-the-mill fantasy music.47 Ronin had tremendous potential. You can see the amount of love for ancient japan, it's culture and it's mythology, that went into the production of this film. It could have followed other fantasy retellings of ancient history such as Zack Snyder's 300 or Troy. It could have been a tight ensemble film like FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING expanding on the group dynamic. Imagine how epic it could have been if it was ""ancient Japanese Band of Brothers in the style of 300"". Alas, we have what we got. An expensive work of a debut director that despite a powerful cast, wonderful performances and visual effects, seems written like some japanophile's fan fiction.",47 Ronin
90,in1984,Tragedy in Death and Life,5,19 March 2014,"5.1 of 10. The story, at least at the end, tries to impose obedience to one's community and country, ""loyalty and honor"", as the primary element. That takes a lot away from what was mostly an impressive, even if too mythical, tragedy better left without an attempt at an authoritative interpretation.It certainly helps you understand Japan's respect for suicide given the amount of respect Japan has for the legend. It also shows that the UK of Asia also had many similar problems in its history leading up to the 20th Century. An empire ruled by royalty, family, feudal lords, and bribes. The bribery element, however, is completely ignored in this version, which is a major failure given its importance again in the modern world.Technically, it's nice to watch and the action doesn't slow down even when it would benefit from a break and more historical context for the sake of accuracy. There's even little comedic elements thrown in to help soften the otherwise harsh tragedy.",47 Ronin

Add to that a story of such importance to Japan; etiquette, honour, bravery and love, with some really wonderful performances and you have an idea of 47 Ronin. It is engaging and holds you in the palm of its hand for two relatively short hours; it is two hours well spent and was well worth the wait of all the delays in release. At the end the emotion and relief/sadness leaves you feeling a little bit shredded and I was so infinitely glad that ""Hollywood"" didn't take the film and say ""and they all lived happily ever after"" which would have been a total travesty.Secondly, contrary to what people have said about this film, before seeing it I might add, Keanu Reeves was well cast as Kai the ""half-breed outcast"" as he portrayed the grace, humility, honour and ability of the man perfectly whether he's a character in the original story or not - Kai was an important character in the film, and added another layer to the story. Reeves had clearly studied Japanese etiquette, custom and correctness for this and you could see in every move he made he was a perfectionist, and even mirrored the Japanese mode of speech so that his English didn't sound too dissimilar from theirs. No woodenness (as many always go on about)! It's not perfect, some of the editing was a little odd, and jarred initially, but in places you could see it was speeding up the excitement jumping between two simultaneous events that were fast-paced. The story jumped and weaved about a bit, in that some parts of the story were gone into in depth whereas others were done quickly and with little explanation, so pace was an issue, but whilst it was noteworthy, these things do not detract from the film. The SFX were amazing, a little reminder of The Matrix in places, and there were touches of all the great oriental martial arts films in some of the sword (katana) fights. As well as all the wonder and epic storytelling and jaw dropping spectacle there was also humour, and the full cinema erupted into mirth just at a point where the story was getting a bit bogged down in the minutiae of all the ronin tramping through some woods. The cinema was full and I was surprised that it was mainly groups of guys, but there was plenty in the film for girls, it wasn't just a fighting/action film. It must also be remembered that the fantasy aspect of this film isn't random, and thrown in, stories like this are common in Japanese (&Chinese/Mongolian etc) mythology and part of the culture too. Whilst not strictly perhaps part of the 47 Ronin story, necessarily, the fantasy in the film can be seen as a wider story, including some aspects of Japanese Buddhist/Shinto narrative of heroes conquering evil. So Reeves was excellent, but the star of the show was Hiroyuki Sanada, who's incredible performance in The Railway Man blew my mind and I was looking forward to seeing him in this. His performance as the leader of the Samurai, Oishi, was so measured and he, as well as Kai, had such emotionally challenging roles and he rose to that challenge; to play such a classic role as a Japanese actor must have been quite a burden, to do it justice, and I think he did. Mika (Ko Shibasaki) the Feudal Lord Asano's daughter was striking, her costumes were lovely and her make up whilst a nod to traditional Japanese style was modern and pretty. I found her very engaging and believable as the high born lady in love with the poor outcast, and the chemistry between them was so convincing and touching, made more poignant by their only brief stolen moments together. The protagonist, the witch, Rinko Kikuchi, was malevolent, seductive and a little comedic in places, her costume was a mockery of traditional Japanese dress – deliberately of course – taking the low back, of Geisha costume to the nth degree, splitting her skirts high in her kimono, and loosening her traditional hair style which put me in mind of the wayward Hatsumomo in Memoirs of a Geisha. Others in Lord Kira's court (the bad guy) where made to be hideous with eccentric Alice in Wonderland type affectation of the Japanese style.Definitely a film for the big screen and one you could see again and again, I think. I certainly could. A real spectacle that was also a wonderful gripping story. I will admit it exceeded my expectations, and I'm telling everyone to go see it!",47 Ronin
92,shawneofthedead,"An odd, fantastical twist on a true story - not as bad as you're expecting, though not as good as history would have it.",6,18 December 2013,"It never bodes well for a film when its release date is delayed - much less when it's been pushed back a whole year, ostensibly to accommodate reshoots that would bump up Keanu Reeves' completely imaginary role in a Western blockbuster take on a classic, awe-inspiring tale right out of the Japanese history books. That way lies disaster and madness, one would think - and certainly the bland, monster-heavy trailers for 47 Ronin did the film no favours. Smack down your inner critic, however, and this epic fantasy flick - for that's what it is - turns out to be reasonably palatable fare.The bare bones of the true story are all there: the kindly Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is ordered to commit seppuku - ritual suicide by disembowelment - when he almost mortally offends Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano - a nicely ironic name if ever there was one). This renders all the honourable samurai in Asano's service masterless i.e., ronin. Led by the noble Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada), the loyal band of 47 ronin vow to avenge Asano - even though they have been ordered by their Shogun (top military commander) not to do so.What's less accurate, of course, is pretty much all the rest of it. Reeves plays Kai, a half-British, half-Japanese orphan who's taken in by Asano but treated like an outcast by everyone in the household - except, of course, for Asano's loving daughter Mika (Kou Shibasaki). Kira's nefarious plans have the support of Mizuki (Rinko Kikuchi), a witch who can apparently take any form she likes: wolf, snake or dragon. It's all a bit nonsensical, especially when Kai tries to get swords for the ronin amongst some pretty creepy folk who have gone from society's outcasts to being part of what looks like a supernatural cult.In other words, 47 Ronin is a faintly ridiculous addition to the wealth of Chūshingura - fictionalised accounts of the 47 ronin tale - that already exist in Japan. It's the kind of big, dumb blockbuster in which the good guys literally live to die another day as long as the plot calls for it. These fearless ronin even survive when the villain is protected by a witch with crazy mystical powers! She can set an entire field on fire, create poisonous spiders and turn into a dragon! And the ronin - at least 47 of them - live anyway! It's crazy! That's what makes it all the more surprising when 47 Ronin turns out to be... well,actually not half-bad. Once you've accepted the sillier aspects of the film for what they are, it's easy to get swept along by its very earnest drama and spectacle. Reeves' storyline is a made-up jumble of nonsense, but is played very straight - this is, in effect, Sad Keanu: The Movie - and it just about works. Casting Reeves as the outsider allows him to do what he does best: play the role with stony-faced reserve, whether he's levelling up by battling demons in cage matches or pining moodily after Mika. Kai's restrained love story with Mika is fairly predictable stuff, with the girl fading a little too much into the background (don't expect any bloodletting from Shibasaki, Battle Royale fans), but it's salvaged by the rather non-Hollywood way in which it all ends.For all that Reeves takes centre stage in the publicity campaign, the film belongs just as much to Sanada's Oishi. He undertakes a more arduous emotional journey: one that takes him from grudging to full-hearted acceptance of Kai's worth as a warrior and comrade. His relationship with his family is more fully examined than Kai's unwavering loyalty to the Asano clan. As Oishi plots his course of action, one that will bring him shame for disobeying the Shogun even as he avenges his master, he warns his wife and son Chikara (Jin Akanishi) to disavow him. Their reactions provide some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the entire film.All things considered, the title of the film is a bit of a misnomer - it would more accurately be called 2 Ronin, subtitled Oishi And Kai's Excellent Adventure - and it suffers from a lamentable lack of humour and historical accuracy. But it's not a complete travesty. Tucked away beneath a layer of mystical beasts and witches lies a story with enough heart, nobility and soul to survive even the oddest twists and turns.",47 Ronin
93,TheMarwood,"Not awful, just dull",4,11 June 2014,"After a nightmare production that sent the budget into the stratosphere, which subsequently got first time director Carl Rinsch fired, one could only hope for a specular failure of excess and spending that ends up on the screen. The $175+ million budget is not on the screen - this is a flat, dull, visually bland film that looks relatively cheap and plays it's story safe. 47 Ronin barely has a pulse. There's no energy, no regard to pace and most of the film is a dead corpse up there on the screen. Every character is somber and looks miserable and the film plays out that way as well. It just limps along until it at least has the courage to end the story properly, but there's so little emotional connection to any character or the film itself, that there's little impact. 47 Ronin will probably be remembered only as a giant financial write off, as the film is instantly forgettable.http://www.boxofficeflops.com/yearly-breakdowns/2013-2/47-ronin/",47 Ronin
94,flingebunt,A very superficial telling of a classic Japanese story,5,22 March 2015,"The 47 Ronin is the true story of a group of Japanese samurai who become masterless samurai, or ronin after their master is killed by a rival lord. One year later they gather together to kill the murderer or their master and then kill themselves. This is a story that is part of the stylised history of Feudal Japan, with codes about honour, Samurai and so on. That is where this movies goes completely off the deep end. It is so stylised in regards to how western people see Japan, it has the look but not the feel of the era. We don't get any depth of any of the characters and all their actions are driven entirely by their Japaneseness.What is worse is the addition of another character, a half-breed westerner who suddenly becomes integral to the entire plot with the Japanese characters mostly deferring to him. There is also the addition of various mystical and magical elements almost randomly added to make the story even more mysteriously Japanesy. The movie looks beautiful, has great acting and that is about it. Feudal Japan was a much more bawdy and rowdy place than this movie portrays, and without that realistic element the movie just eye candy.",47 Ronin
95,kermitkid,Meh,6,30 March 2020,"Oh, trailers, why are you so inaccurate sometimes? The advertising makes this look like a must-see film. It is not. It's just silly. However, although it is PG-13, it has minimal blood, (only the Ronin writing their names and then giving their thumbs a small cut, then pressing down on their name.) it's goreless, has no nudity, or profanity. One of the cleanest PG-13 films I've seen in a while. (Along with Saving Mr. Banks which I also saw today) But ""based on a true story"" as the ads claim? Highly doubt it. Dragons do not exist. If you're going to claim a film actually happened at least give it some realism. I walked in expecting something awesome, and came out thinking ""Not as good as I expected, but just OK. I don't love it, I don't hate it. """,47 Ronin
96,jb_campo,Entertaining myth-filled film,6,25 March 2015,"47 Ronin surprised me by being actually a quite enjoyable film. I didn't expect great acting, and was not disappointed. Keanu Reeves plays the half breed Kai who has some sort of special powers. The Samurai in olden Japan really play by the rules. The Ronin are ex-Samurai who were stripped of their titles by disgracing the leader, the Shogun.Of course, in this case, there is evil mysterious magic being used to take over Ako, the land where this beautiful girl is supposed to rule, but loses it in disgrace. She and Kai apparently have something special going on. There are many scenes of serious looks from a lot of people about a lot of things, but none of it means much. this film is about fighting and action.There's plenty of both with wild chases and sword fights and kung fu. The Ronin do teach you about extracting revenge, and what real justice means in the old days. At the end, well, they are real professionals and take their licks that they knew were coming. It was all about honor in old Japan, and this leaves you a bit sad, but respectful of a difficult tradition for westerners to understand.If you go into 47 Ronin with proper expectations, you will enjoy the story. Acting is b-grade, but overall, the movie was surprisingly entertaining. I hope you enjoy it.",47 Ronin
97,Jerghal,Problematic production but decent movie,7,25 March 2014,"47 Ronin must be one of the most problematic -if not THE most bumpy production in the history of Universal. Directed by first time director and Ridley Scott protegé Carl Rinsch the cost of the production rose from 175m$ to 225m$. There were all sorts of creative differences, Keanu Reeves' role was to small, tons of rewrites, re-shoots, re-edits and plenty of studio interference. All these negative vibes combined with poor marketing resulted in a disastrous US opening weekend and slightly better but still disappointing international box-office numbers. Even before it was released Universal reportedly booked a 150m$ write-off on the movie - talk about confidence in your own product. The critics also didn't get to see it until right before the release in fear their negative reviews would cause an even great financial crater. After all this you probably would expect a pretty horrible film but in reality it's actually quite alright. The film unfolds in a world where samurai, mythical creatures and magic co-exist. The production design and costumes are quite gorgeous, as is the beautiful and colorful cinematography. Of course there are problems too: Keanu Reeves lacks a bit of charisma but is not bad for the character he's supposed to play. The supporting actors (all Japanese) are struggling somewhat with the English dialogue (they learned them phonetically) but do rather well acting wise. Apparently there was also a bigger role for the tattooed pirate captain (you might have seen him on one of the posters) but the studio cut his part almost completely out. I would very much like to see an honest documentary on the making of this film but it's quite possible we'll never get to see it. But it didn't turn out too bad. It's good entertainment but not a classic. Surely it didn't deserve to bomb so badly at the cinemas. 47 Ronin could get a second life on Blu-ray where we could get all sorts of interesting director's cuts (if the studio still let's Carl touch the film) and maybe one of them might turn out to be a classic, who knows...",47 Ronin
98,digdog-785-717538,Disgusting,4,22 October 2014,"I haven't written reviews for a while but watching 47 Ronin brought me out of retirement to wage war on just how f* horrible this movie is.First off, it's brown. Everything is brown. It's like the put a brown filter in front of the lens. The director of photography should be shot for putting his name to this monstrosity - there is no sense of color that even a college student would have, Jesus, 7 Samurai has a better sense of color and that's shot in black and white.Second, the director doesn't direct. Five guys walking is NOT an interesting shot, 10 guys sitting isn't either. The film is boring already, we don't need slow scenes when there is no exposition, no out of action focus, no development.The script is horrible. The 47 Ronin is a story about honor, a fairly strong emotion; to have the film completely devoid of any emotion makes the whole thing pointless. The addition of the witch isn't bad, and i guess we have to tolerate the acrobatic fight-ballet and gigantic monster fighters that come with modern Hollywood, but do we need fake Japanese accents? Do we need crying concubines and grunting Japanese men when these are just recycled from real Japanese films, in real Japanese settings, where they actually make sense? It's like someone spliced together half of a kurosawa film and half of the matrix. And while we're on the subject of REAL samurai films, WHY has the major point of the story of the 47 ronin been left out? Where for a year the 47 strived to act like they were humiliated and hopeless, pretending to leave behind their bushido - which in itself is the key of the plot, since the holder of bushido *cannot* deny bushido. This feat, is the key of the original story - based on fact, mind you.So; it's f* boring, it's as predictable as they come (which means you can forget about having any suspense or surprise), and the ""good"" bits are lifted right out of corny Hollywood action films, a-la Lethal Weapon. No tnx.My final vote: 4/10, a complete waste of time.",47 Ronin
99,mistoppi,I'd rather see Japanese versions of this story,6,10 May 2016,"First thing I have to say is I'm not too familiar with Japanese culture. I know the basics that are always there when you're watching a movie that takes place in Japan or something like that. I have no idea if 47 Ronin butchered Japanese culture or if it's slightly accurate or whatever. I'm not the right person to address this, but I hope I'll see some discussion about this.And that brings us to another issue, one thing that will probably bother some if not most of the viewers: English. The characters are speaking English most through the movie. It isn't a miracle considering 47 Ronin is an American movie, and it took most of its time in the same place. That's why it doesn't matter that much. If the Japanese characters would meet a lot of foreigners it would be more annoying, if they spoke English with each other and with foreigners. Anyway, if the story is intriguing enough the language isn't that big of a deal. Of course I'd rather see an actual Japanese film version of a story like this, and luckily there seem to be many, but this is what I rented.The story of 47 Ronin is classic. It's about revenge. What's more classic than that? But the revenge in this kind of movie is different from how it is in Hollywood. In 47 the revenge is more about honour. The samurais failed their lord and they must restore their honour. It gives something new to the ""they hurt me or someone I loved, now they must pay"" type of revenge, even though that is enjoyable as it is.Historical fantasy is usually boring, because it's always the same. Mostly because writers are too afraid, so they just coddle with whatever Tolkien brought us with his medieval fantasy settings. When that fantasy is mixed with Japan's history it gives something new to this fantasy genre, even if fantasy didn't play that huge part in the movie. But at least it was a some kind of change to all the knights and orcs and whatever western medieval fantasy is filled with.I enjoyed watching this film. It's not the best one out there, but I could consider watching it again. There are a lot better movies out there, and Japanese movies are of course way better than this one, or at least I'm guessing they are but 47 Ronin is alright too.",47 Ronin

You'll thank me. This movie is based on a true story but uses fantasy elements for what reason(I didn't find out during the picture, and trust me you won't either.) the movie doesn't have one.In 47 Ronin(more like 47 boredom)Keanu Reeves leads the cast as Kai, an outcast who joins Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada), the leader of 47 outcast samurai. Together they seek vengeance upon the treacherous overlord who killed their master and banished their kind. To restore honor to their homeland, the warriors embark upon a quest that challenges them with a series of trials that would destroy ordinary warriors.I say 47 boredom because it even though has some special effects(that are really not all that special)it's the most boring samurai and swordfighting movie you will ever see.The movie is like aching boy pain cause your body will beg you to go to sleep just by watching this film.The characters, trust you just won't care,because this story has no structure or character development.Look all I can say is this the biggest disappointment you will see, 47 ronin gets a one and a half out of five.",47 Ronin
101,lyubitelfilmov,Honor is more important than death or Fairytale version of the famous legend,7,14 November 2020,"Fantasy thriller. A fabulous version of the famous Japanese legend about the revenge of the forty-seven ronin on the murderer of his master, and a pretty good role for Keanu Reeves. I confess that at one time I really wanted to go to the cinema for this picture, but circumstances were against it, but later, in fact, when the picture came out in DVD and Blu-ray format, I did not hesitate to buy a blu-ray disc in the usual format ( there was a 3D version, but then I did not have a TV with support for this very 3D), and watched it with pleasure. Now I understand (after the next revision) that then I greatly overestimated the assessment, because this picture is a passing one, not carrying great value. And here's my brief opinion - Honor is more important than death. As with most paintings, there are both pros and cons that I intend to talk about, so brew tea, grab some treats, sit back, we get started.
So the pros:
1. Scenario - the picture is based on a real story about forty-seven ronin who took revenge on a vile enemy who, through intrigue, killed their master. They knew very well that death awaited them all, but the honor and code of Bushido did not allow them to live with the fact that their master would not be avenged. The script itself takes this story, which became famous not only in Japan, but throughout the world as an example of valor and honor, and if I succeed, then I myself would like to visit their graves and pay tribute to their courage, honor and contempt for death, and adds witches, magic, Japanese mythology, which doesn't look bad. Of course, a lot was altered to please the script, some things were not mentioned at all, but in general, if you do not find fault with the details, the script turned out to be strong, logical and even exciting. There are no revelations here, if you are familiar with the legend, then you already know how everything will end. The final turned out to be a little even emotional.
2. Atmosphere - Japan at the beginning of the eighteenth century as it is, with its samurai, shoguns, traditional way of life, familiar attributes. You can't say that the picture was shot mostly in Hungary, and only for close-ups they hit the road in Japan.
3. Costumes and decorations - at a high level, and not surprising, because the budget was not small (one hundred and seventy-five million green). If you love samurai paintings, then all this will be a joy to you, even the banners are conveyed quite accurately.
4. Romantic line - there was a place for her, and of course she is ""forbidden"" here, which further enhances the feelings of lovers. She is shown here beautifully, and I even liked her, especially considering her finale.
So the cons:
1. 3D - no, the picture itself is not bad, but the 3D itself is clearly not the best here, it was quite possible to do without it, since the dynamic scenes turned out to be quite good, but exciting, they obviously cannot be called in any way. It doesn't add up to the fact that most of these scenes take place at night and in the final battle. I'm glad that I didn't overpay for this 3D in due time.
2. Bloopers, logical mistakes - there are many of them, one three-strip French flag is worth something, although the action of the picture takes place at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, when France had a white phage with the coat of arms of the royal dynasty of Bourbon. I will not list all of them. Well, there were some logical miscalculations, which were already clearly visible.
3. Extras - or rather a small amount. Really? You couldn't hire more people, even so that you have exactly forty-seven ronin in the frame, not twenty? You had a budget, and a lot! Either it is hack, or misappropriation of funds. It looks like when it came to the extras, most of the money had already gone to expensive graphics and costumes, so decide to save some money, and hoped that no one would notice, because the emphasis was on 3D, but I noticed, and I'm not alone!
A little about the main characters:
1. Kai performed by Keanu Reeves is a half-breed, a servant in the house of Lord Asano, who is despised by all samurai, but despite this, he faithfully serves them. His past will still play a key role. Shows himself as a skillful warrior and a brave person. Keanu was the one who promoted this picture to the masses, well, he played at a good level, and without revelations. Not a bad acting game, but I won't scold Keanu, because he has such a role, although a little emotion would not hurt, but even in the finale.
2. Oishi Yoshio Kuranosuke performed by Hiroyuki Sanada is the main samurai of Lord Asano, who, after his death, became a spiritual leader and one who encouraged the ronin to avenge the death of the master. It was his decisive actions that helped to accomplish the plan, and it was he who attracted Kai, whose help was irreplaceable. I saw Hiroki in a lot of pictures, and for me he is the second famous Japanese actor (the first is Ken Watanabe), I had the honor to make sure of his acting talents many times, and here he did not drop the quality bar. Bravo!
3. Mika performed by Ko Shibasaki is the daughter of Daimyo Asano, who is secretly in love with Kai's half-breed. A delicate flower caught in a whirlpool of events. Shows no less courage than the ronin, being in captivity. Ko did an excellent job with this role, and her costumes were very good for her. Kisses to the pen!
I also remember Rinko Kikuchi as a damn charming but deadly witch, and Tadanobu Asano as the main villain.
The picture, despite the big name Keanu Reeves and a large budget, and no less large advertising costs, failed miserably at the box office, not even beating off its own, far from small budget (I remind you - one hundred and seventy-five million), and the fees amounted to one hundred and fifty one million with a penny. Am I sorry? Not really.
As a result, we have a good fantasy action movie with a powerful Keanu Reeves in the title role, a good script, a good atmosphere, not without jambs and blunders, and with good acting work.",47 Ronin

Am I sorry? Not really.
As a result, we have a good fantasy action movie with a powerful Keanu Reeves in the title role, a good script, a good atmosphere, not without jambs and blunders, and with good acting work.",47 Ronin

104,loco_73,"$175,000,000 for this! Wow!",5,15 January 2014,"Let me first begin by saying that this was not a bad movie, not nearly as bad others I have had the misfortune and displeasure of seeing.Still, $175,000,000 dollars for this production is just an awful lot of money! A mammoth production supposedly...though honestly after seeing the movie I have a hard time imagining exactly where all that money ended up being spent! The special effects are unremarkable and the production values are not higher than let's say what I get to see on a weekly basis from HBO's amazing (and my favourite) series ""Game Of Thrones""!!! In fact I would venture to say that in ""Game Of Thrones"" the production values, FX, costumes, art direction and the myriad of other details which make a movie or a series be what they are, are higher than those of ""47 Ronin"".Basically this did not look or feel like a movie on which soo much money was spent.The problem this movie has, was the direction the studio and by extension the director chose to undertake. Here we have a fairly well known story, with enough material to make for a simple, straightforward yet engaging and interesting movie. Instead the director decided to add all the fantastical elements and an unnecessary character (Kai aka Keanu Reeves)with a storyline that did little to add to the overall quality of the movie but confuse ultimately creating the bloated mess the movie becomes.They could have instead focused only on the Ronin and their story. The movie could have easily been made for a more modest budget, maybe in the range of $50-$80 million dollars (max.). It could also have been shorter by at least 15-20 minutes without affecting the overall story in particular and the overall quality of the movie in general. Oh yeah, and the 3D, which is utterly unremarkable and quite sparse in the movie, could have been done without! The decision to go with a PG-13/PG rating also was a gamble that did not pay off in the end, not to mention that it made for some rather spotty and choppy editing, as the violence and gore was cut down to almost nothing. Had they gone for a much cheaper, R-rated movie, I think they would have stood a better chance at succeeding at the box office as well as garnering more critical acclaim rather than the literal s*itstorm it has inherited from critics and moviegoers alike.I am sure an unrated Blu-ray/DVD and digital copy of the movie will be released to re-coup some of the costs associated with producing it, but that will be too little to late..Another head-scratcher was...having a Japanese cast, speak English...all heavy laden with a Japanese accent?!?!? Why not just film the entire movie in Japanese and use subtitles, even though for some reason North American audiences are rather lazy and still seem to have a problem with the basic function of reading...especially subtitles at movies...Sure it is inconvenient for a little bit at the beginning, but then it goes away...if you're only willing to try!The Japanese actors were by enlarge very good in their respective roles, of note and the best was Hiroyuki Sanada (Oishi) who we last saw in ""The Wolverine"" and is now currently in ""Helix"" (SyFy's newest project). To my mind HE should have been the heart and soul of the movie. Well known and familiar veteran actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (""The Last Emperor"") was also good in his brief but relevant role as the Shogun. As for Rinko Kikuchi (""Pacific Rim"", ""Babel"") who is a tremendous actress, she wasn't given much to do, besides sulk, stare, crouch and occasionally fly...And then there is Keanu Reeves. He IS NOT awful in this movie as many seem to point out. The problem he has in this movie is that his presence is largely irrelevant! His role seems to have been ""added-on"" by the producers and the director who wanted a ""well-known face"" in order to better sell and market this movie, since the rest of the cast, with the few exceptions mentioned, are largely unknown in North America. Better they had taken the chance with the cast they had, without casting Keanu Reeves in a role that is largely superfluous, brings nothing to the movie and wasn't really needed.""47 Ronin"" certainly had potential but as soo many Hollywood driven projects these days, fell short and well off the mark...prompting yet another ""When will they learn?"" kind of reaction from this here moviegoer.",47 Ronin
105,achyutaghosh,cold turkey,6,5 January 2014,"The tale of the 47 Ronin is the most enduring of legends that emphasized medieval Japan's defining values- loyalty, honor, and sacrifice. A group of leaderless samurai (ronin) who avenged their master's honor after planning for two years, and then cheerfully taking their own lives (seppuku) makes for a riveting story. But then the core values of the narrative, and the motivations of the ronin whose best case scenario is an honorable death, do limit its global reach. So what does Hollywood do about it? Pump in billions of dollars, get in a globally recognized star, overload it with VFX, shoot it in 3D, and convert what is essentially a drama into a sword and sorcery fable. Too many colossal mistakes in one movie, i must say. So central to this version is an out-caste, Kai (played by Keanu Reeves at his wooden best) who is supposedly trained by demons to be a killer, but instead chooses to lead a life serving a group of thankless samurai, and secretly loving his master, Lord Asano's daughter, Mika. When his master is framed by rival lord Kira and is forced to commit seppuku, Kai along with the remaining followers of Asano execute an elaborate vengeance, which finally ends with their own mass ritual suicides. To do that though, Kai has to battle a variety of monsters, witches and other inhuman beings in video game style, while somberly declaring his love for the Lady Asano-""I will search for you through 1000 worlds and 10000 lifetimes.""Guess Kai is still searching. While the plot may appeal to a wider audience, and the visual effects are stylish, there is little else to cheer about. The story is a Japanese national treasure and so there was a need to be respectful towards it. But 5 minutes into the movie, it dives into fantasy genre, though lacking the humor, wonderment, and fun associated with it. The genre straddling nature of the movie is its biggest weakness. Next is Keanu Reeves. The ladies may throw stones at me for this, but I never believed Reeves to be a good actor to start with, and here he is at his monotonous worst. Oops, there goes your global markets. The local Japanese cast fares better, but then they play caricatures. Third is the PG13 rating, which means no on screen blood. Samurai epic, an entire army apparently chopped to pieces and no blood? Hello? Revenge is a dish best served cold, they say. But unfortunately, this vengeful tale never warms up. The endeavor to tell the story of the 47 ronin had it all- a strong source material, lots of money to play with, but what it lacked was good imagination. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen all that was worth watching in the film. Can be avoided- 6/10",47 Ronin
106,abouhelier-r,47 Ronin,7,6 April 2014,"A band of Samurai and an Half-breed set out to revenge the death of their master after being banished of their land, enslaved and dishonoured by the hands of a ruthless Shogun and their master's murderer. The half-breed character (half Japanese and English) named Kai, starring Keanu Reeves, enters being used as a tracker and hunter. As a child he learnt martial techniques and nature connections, he can passes through space. And obviously Kai is in love with the princess. His journey lead him to save her from the clutches of Lord Kira. 47 Ronin is the ""Americanised"" version of a very well known legend in Japan dealing with very important themes such as Honor, correcting a wrong, sacrifice, the few off the many, truth and spirit. It's narrating a story mainly but it's also introducing some of the Japanese culture content to the world. This film is no way like one of my father old Samurai movie. It has great sets, what director is trying to achieve is in camera with great special effects and creatures creation mainly. There is a perfect amount of Fantasy details, never in the film characters are talking about proper magic but demons and witchcraft directly coming from the Japanese mythology. Except those scene extensions it's an old style movie making process with classical sets, huge installation, lots of people, extras, beautiful costumes, a lot of lights, cameras and actions. 47 Ronin gets exactly the essence of Japanese countryside landscape, far away from the city, and it looks gorgeous! Keanu Reeves is certainly not the greatest actor alive however he's a really good physical actor and sell the action scenes very well. He is COOL! Plus, he doesn't appear like the typical ""American guy"" leading the movie and saving everyone, etc. He really is just a team member. This film has to work as a ""team"" movie obviously because if the characters had been taken individually, they could have been boring and not so important at least. There we can see the evolution of Kai's character friendship with Oîshi, they're trying to know each other, and respect is growing along the journey. Finally, the first 45 mins could have been saved and summed up in some sort of prologue, as the pace is very slow. Things begin really in the last 30 mins of the film and it looks very cool, but the viewer doesn't take the time to appreciate it for what it worth because the movie ends very quickly.

108,lucasnochez,Review: 47 Ronin/ www.nightfilmreviews.com,6,8 January 2014,"Keanu Reeves may not be the best actor working today. His monotone delivery is one that is easily recognized and yet constantly scrutinized by critics and audiences alike. Ironically enough, Reeves has been one of the most bankable stars working in the last two decades, always recouping a film's budget if not surpassing it altogether and drawing in huge profits. Unfortunately, Reeves has had a taste of his first blockbuster bomb, and after almost 20 years as a recognized Hollywood star, it's admirable to know that it took this long for him to have a bomb of a film. What's more admirable in the Reeves canon, however, is how dedicated he is to honouring Asian culture and his constant efforts to preserve the integrity and authenticity of folklore throughout its transition to the big screen. For that, Reeves is an actor who may not be in-line for an Oscar but one who I am proud to call a fine Canadian and preserver of ancient Japanese and Chinese culture.Born in Lebanon from a native English mother and Hawaiian father with Chinese, Portuguese, and Irish ancestry, Reeves encapsulates the cultural mosaic that is Canada. Raised as a Canadian, and identifying as such, Reeves is front and centre in 47 Ronin–an American take on Japanese folklore, featuring a Canadian film star, American director and a predominantly Japanese cast. Now talk about a blend of cultures for the sake of art.47 Ronin is not a terrible film by any means. Instead, the film surfaces as a very loyal, overly-spectacular and highly embellished account of Japanese culture and history. With the addition of witchcraft, demons, monsters, half-breeds and stylistic alter-world entities, the film at times feels like a dated piece of cinema which loses much of its extravagant special effects credit due to its elongated production time and the context in which it is presented. 47 Ronin succeeds in its focus on the Japanese tale, highlighting the essential themes of honour, dignity, loyalty, and duty, as opposed to the more obvious spectacles of mystical creatures inhabiting a special-effects laden world.The story begins with Kai (Reeves), an outcast boy who is the offspring of a British sailor and peasant Japanese woman. When a young Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) finds Kai in a nearby forest, he believes that the boy is possessed and was raised by demons. Saved by master Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) and adopted into the town, Kai lives a life where he is barely visible to anyone–except Princess Mika (Kô Shibaski) who he is secretly falling in love with. After many years of becoming the designated ""half-breed"" of the village, Kai integrates into the town and just survives. It is not until Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) arrives to the town for a traditional ceremony when neighbouring town leader and power-hungry Lord Kira (Tabanobu Asano) and his witch-crafting mistress (Rinko Kikuchi) sabotage Lord Asano, leading him to his death. Outcastes like Kai, the remaining soldiers under Lord Asano's reign become Ronin (a samurai with no Lord or Master). Oishi, the leader of Lord Asano's army, is imprisoned for a year. Upon his release, Oishi begins a plan to avenge Lord Asano's death with the help of Kai and the remaining Ronin against Lord Kira.In 1997, Reeves met virtually unknown yet soon-to-be star choreographer Tiger Hu Chen while making The Matrix. As time passed, the two became good friends and Chen taught Reeves much of the old and almost lost techniques of the Japanese and Chinese cultures. Through Chen, Reeves was able to gain a new appreciation for a culture that ran through his blood, but seemed almost forgotten. In the five years it took to make 47 Ronin, Reeves was able to still act in other films and make his feature film directorial debut with The Man of Tai Chi, starring his friend Chen. Reeves, who has Chinese blood in his ancestry, seems almost destined for roles like Kai. With that said, it is so unfortunate that a tale with such fibre and poignancy, was done so poorly and half-heartedly.47 Ronin is a stylized and fantastical reimagining of the classic tale with giants and witches–but not much heart. Taking cues from The Lord of the Rings trilogy as well as action sequences from Troy, Ronin is an exhausted, lacklustre fantasy adventure with a sword's edge that isn't quite as sharp as we'd like. The most moving scenes in the film involve those around the ritual suicide (seppuku) of its one-dimensional characters and the betrayal by lust each character faces within the film.Unfortunately for the film, it seems that it will be remembered more so for its box-office failure than for the story itself. Opening a week prior in Japan to dismal reviews and a poor box-office response, it seems impossible that the film has any real chance of making back its ridiculous $175 million budget domestically or internationally.47 Ronin will surely be a cautionary tale for studios in the future. Directed by newcomer Carl Rinsch in his feature film debut, this will surely serve as a lesson for production companies entrusting a $175 million fortune to a nearly inexperienced director tackling a beloved historical event and a prestigious part of Japanese culture for the sake of entertaining a mostly Westernized audience. Much like the monotone acting of it's star, 47 Ronin will surely be a mono-layered joke within the movie industry for many years to come, especially when so much potential and embedded history and culture could have made it something more than a lesson for studios in the future.",47 Ronin
109,hoernkeem,"47 Ronin review ( 2013, Carl Rinsch) Nonsensical samurai fantasy",1,7 February 2021,"47 Ronin ( 2013, Carl Rinsch)
This is a useless, boring, nonsensical samurai fantasy tale. It features Keanu Reeves completely miscast and out of place as a half breed orphan, demon thing who is sort of adopted into a feudal lord's family in Shogun era Japan. The lord is beguiled by a rival lord and tricked into betraying himself and thus is forced by samurai code to kill himself. His samurai warriors are banished and become the titular ronin who are basically masterless samurai. The defacto leader of the ronin uncover the betrayal and set about banding together once again to avenge their fallen lord. This film lacks any real emotion or gravitas. Keanu Reeves acts like a piece of cardboard barely generating any emotion at all. As an actor and character he was completely misplaced in this story. The fantasy elements were also poorly done and were just randomly sprinkled though what was otherwise a basic story. The few special effects in the film looked awful and cheap. What should have been a rousing, fun fantasy epic was instead an almost laughable snoozefest with no redeeming qualities.

111,LiamBlackburn,Awesome Japan-Style fantasy epic,9,15 January 2014,"This movie confuses Westerners because they know nothing about the Tao. The cinematography is great. The sets, makeup, costumes are truly vivid and exceptional. Acting is great, KR is a perfect choice as the half- breed warrior-hero since he's half-Asian. The added bonuses of fantastical creatures such as the deer/lion animal from the hunt and the immense orc are amazing. Sword-fighting scenes are choreographed very well. Character-development is good, and you really feel for KR because he is known as the half-breed outcast who is not accepted into the Japanese culture etc. The acting is very low-key, in a Japanese kind of way. You almost feel like you are watching them speak in Japanese (but with English voice-overs) even though they speak in English. The dialog is perfectly-executed in a distinct Japanese Samurai Shogun stoic movie style (which of course lends itself perfectly to KR acting style). There is lots of mist and forest shots, and ghosts, it's just a really cool flick.",47 Ronin
112,JPfanatic93,"47 Ronin: And Keanu, and witches and monsters and stuff",4,5 February 2014,"'To understand the story of the 47 ronin is to understand Japan' this movie states, attempting to place what's to come in a historical context for audiences unfamiliar with ancient Japan. The story of the 47 samurai, who witnessed the death of their master, became shamed ronin and successfully plotted and executed their revenge to regain their honor and die a noble suicide, is one of Japan's most popular and enduring legends. Such a serious tale of death and dishonor is not the usual stuff of Hollywood and therefore this saga was embellished with plenty of action, romance and expensive effects to make it worthy of being turned into a blockbuster. However, the heart of the story was left unchanged and as a result, 47 Ronin proves a rather uncomfortable and uneasy mix of Japanese and western storytelling.47 Ronin is told from the perspective of Kai, a mysterious halfbreed orphan who is found by Lord Asano of Ako province. Despite the advice of his samurai who consider him a demon child, Asano takes him in because he sees 'something' in the boy. Raised alongside Asano's daughter Mika the orphan grows up to be Keanu Reeves, and they develop a typical secret desire for one another (credibility of which is hindered by the fact that Keanu looks and is much older than the actress playing his love interest, though they are meant to be about the same age). Kai is of course an all too obvious attempt to make it easier for western audiences to identify with the strange and unknown Japanese way of life, but as is usually the result of such additions, Kai gets too important for the story's good, as if the movie's 'natives' are unable to carry out their bold plan without a white man's help. Identification is ever a challenge for the audience in the case of the stoic Reeves, and 47 Ronin proves no different, though his emotionless expression at least suits the subject matter. However, Asano was right, as Kai is no ordinary boy but is indeed connected with the supernatural. Which is just as well, as it turns out 18th Century Japan, unlike the original legend told us, was surprisingly infested with the occult, monsters and wraiths. Did I mention 47 Ronin is also a fantasy movie? Asano suffers a rivalry with the ruthless Lord Kira (who ironically is played by Tadanobu Asano). Hellbent on taking over Ako (and eventually everything else too), Kira employs the talents of a shapeshifting witch (Pacific Rim's Rinko Kikuchi) to stir things up. Kikuchi is evidently enjoying the role of seductive sorceress, but like her boss plays evil for evil's sake, which makes for a rather poorly motivated, dull duo of bad guys. Their schemes succeed as Asano is tricked into openly attempting to kill Kira in the presence of their shogun, for which he is sentenced to seppuku. Romanticising this act of suicide, Asano's death is overly poetic and bloodless, despite the fact he's disemboweling himself and getting his head struck off. After his death, his samurai are declared dishonored ronin and, to turn insult into agony, Mika is forced to wed Lord Kira. This will not do, after which Asano's captain Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada, grave and cold) plots revenge. And even though he never liked him, he asks Kai to join the quest. Good thing too, as the revelation of his upbringing by forest ghosts sure aids in defeating their monstrous and demonic opponents. Most of which were already defeated in terms of convincing the audience due to the poor visual effects job done on them.Amidst all the cutting off of heads, it's evident that a different kind of cutting called editing also did not work in 47 Ronin's favor. At times it's obvious that material was discarded, making for an occasionally jumbled flow of the movie's plot, especially in the case of the scenes on the 'Dutch Island'. An impressively tattooed pirate, heavily used in the film's marketing campaign, is seen only for a short moment, while a perceptive eye is able to spot a brief appearance by Yorick van Wageningen: changes in the post-production process reduced his part to the quickest of cameos. At least there is nothing wrong with the design of the movie, which does at times look sensational and exotic, even in 3D. Though little effective use is made of that technology, as the straightforward quest for vengeance is otherwise quite two-dimensional. Despite all the added fantasy spectacle, the story remains the tale of a group of angry knights seeking revenge for the death of their lord. Their sense of Honor is all that matters, a point which the movie gets across, but is hard to be approved by everybody.The only understanding western audiences will take away with them from seeing 47 Ronin is that Hollywood and Japanese legend don't mix to everybody's satisfaction. We understand that Japanese notions of honor are obsessed with ritual suicide, choosing death over life even when the situation, from our point of view, would definitely dictate differently. As the movie is transformed into otherwise fairly standard fantasy fare, the conclusion of the legend is left unchanged: evil has been vanquished, the land made safe, but still the 47 Ronin are ordered to die, as per the climax of the original story. No happy end by western standards here, as Keanu and his fellow warriors take their own life (gladly, even!), leaving their grieving loved ones behind, for such is their way of honor. In this regard, the Japanese can be glad Hollywood left the core of their legend untampered despite the addition of witches and monsters to make things more exciting, but a 'gaijin' audience is left estranged as their notions of what constitutes a satisfactory ending are shattered. To understand the story of the 47 ronin is to acknowledge the clash of cultures between Japan and Hollywood: 47 Ronin makes that much painfully clear.",47 Ronin
113,ksj870,Revenge of the Ronin,7,20 January 2014,"An outcast hero. A ruthless sorceress. A land of honor and majesty, mystery and horror. A small band of brothers-in-arms united against an overwhelming force. Sounds like a great movie, doesn't it?It wouldn't have taken much more for 47 Ronin to be a really great film. It has all the ingredients, from the incredibly wrought Japanese feudal landscape to a proficient cast headlined by action superstar Keanu Reeves. The script is ambitious, and tries hard to tie multiple story strands--including the demands of honor, loyalty to family, prejudice, and justice--all together in a way that doesn't detract from the basic tale of good vs evil at the core. And it all almost works just right.There are two main drawbacks to the film, and while neither is disastrous together they too keep the movie from realizing its potential. First, Keanu Reeves's character (a foreigner who despite his devotion to this clan isn't trusted because he is different) isn't really the star. This might not be a problem if the plot were structured differently, but dividing a narrative between two nearly equal protagonists rarely works, and this is no exception. Hiroyuki Sanada, however, is essentially a co-star as Reeves's reluctant ally, and his character serves to in many ways split the storyline in two. Sanada is a good actor and his character is certainly interesting enough, but films works best with one hero. 47 Ronin really has two heroes--I suspect by accident--and the plot suffers for it.Second, despite the film's billing as a nonstop action showcase, 47 Ronin isn't quite the thrill-ride it's supposed to be. Not that there isn't any action, of course, but it's more rare than the previews lead one to believe and often over quickly. The two flaws come together at the film's climax, with disappointing results. While Reeves battles a powerful witch for the fate of the woman he loves--easily the high point of the movie--Sanada simultaneously fights with an evil warlord in a rather poorly rendered and anti-climactic duel. The film switches back and forth between the two battles with the action further diluted by cuts to a large-scale combat going on between the overlord's army and a band of rebels. The director may have imagined this would tighten suspense. Instead, it dilutes any excitement, badly.But while Reeves--well-cast as the enigmatic half-breed--and Sanada are the twin heroes of the film, the movie's best performance goes to Rinko Kikuchi as the Witch. Kikuchi is delightfully wicked and ruthless in the role, while never allowing the character to fall into self-mockery. It will be interesting to see if Kikuchi's performance carries her over into other work here in America.47 Ronin has a lot going for it, and in fact is probably a little better than the other fantasy-action movie that came out at the same time, that of course being The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Boasting glorious sets and brilliant cinematography and some nice touches, the film just fails to achieve the epic status to which it aspires. It's probably not a movie to buy when it hits the DVD market, but for a single matinée viewing, you could do much worse.",47 Ronin

However... when the story and events continued I found myself Disliking a few things.Like how they assumed that yasuno killed the beast not kai. I understand that its a part of the story cuz kai is a foreigner and half breed etc etc.. but still i didn't like that.Disliked how the Enemy was cheating using witchcraft and wizardry and the main ppl knew but didn't do anything. And let their Lord die for a lie.I enjoyed the stealth revenge of the 47 ronin although it wasn't succeeded fully.In the end the 47 ronin died through seppuku (death by their own hands to show dignity and respect)I guess I dislike it because its not justified.
From the beginning the enemy used witchcraft and cheated then when the good ppl finished their revenge the ruler decided to kill them all through seppuku.
They disobeyed his order and avenged their lord. I understand that But why didn't he judge the enemy fairly? He didn't even consider the fact of cheating or he didn't even know from the beginning.not a fair ending.Overall of 7/10",47 Ronin

This is the second Asian film I've seen him in now, and after watching Man of Tai Chi I thought this movie should be a little better - but sadly it wasn't. I gotta admit, that while I believe Reeves to be one of the worst big name actors in Hollywood (I don't get the ""vacant stare"" method of acting) it actually wasn't his fault that this movie sucked, the plot was paper thin, and basically no real tension or emotion was built at all. In a film like this, it's the fight scenes you look forward to, but even they were dull and boring, which leaves little else. It seems the film was based on some old Japanese legend, but (spoiler!!) having everyone kill themselves at the end was plain daft to me. But then maybe I don't understand the idea of Japanese ""honour"". Anyway, I wonder now has Keanu Reeves shipped out to Asia for good?

Lol.Unfortunately, he hasn't really been any good since the Matrix, and even that is questionable. In this, he's not that bad, but it shouldn't have been him in that role. At. All.

The clan leader commits seppuku (ritual and honourable disembowelment) as punishment. His clan is disbanded, and his samurai all become Ronin (masterless warriors).

The actual story is good, but the execution, well, it sucks. And blows. At the same time.The white honky (Reeves) was supposedly taught how to fight by demons, but in reality, he's not all that good. In fact, he sucks. He also apparently knows a few magic tricks, but only uses them once, which kind of makes them worthless. Why include something cool like that, but then don't use it? And despite actually living his whole life in Japan, he sounds American. And everyone else around him has a Japanese accent. Go figure.Despite these glaring stupidities, there's a lot of good stuff, but it only made me wish I was watching a real Japanese flick, since they'd hopefully cut out all the worthless American rubbish. The semi-authentic Japanese culture is great, and there are too few well-made and SFX flashy samurai/ninja films available.However, for all it's bluster, this film is really empty. The white honky constantly makes you remember that he's not really Japanese, but just a fish out of water bad actor. For their part, the rest of the cast do okay. The story is shallow, and feels kind of short. Obviously they were going for a fantasy feel to it, but some extra time spent in character development could have turned this into a great film, as opposed to the steaming pile of poo it is.There's also a interesting evil warrior... but he just gets killed without doing anything interesting.Obviously this film was never going to be a profound treatise on the human condition, but anyone who tells you this is an amazing film deserves to be punched in the mouth. It's okay, and by okay I mean it's pretty average. I didn't think it was worth the cost of the cinema ticket. The SFX are okay, but there's zero tension, and too few fight sequences. If you're after a mindless, average, shallow, empty film, this one is for you.",47 Ronin

120,zzapper-2,You will think you've seen it before,4,9 January 2017,"Haven't reviewed a movie for ages but felt obliged to do so with this turkey. I came into this film with no preconceptions as I'd somehow missed hearing about it and had no negative opinion of Keanu Reeves (That's normally the best way to see a film). But right from the beginning I was plagued by the feeling I'd seen it before mainly because of all the clichés. Keanu is just awful don't know if it was his fault or the leaden script. Apparently the scenario was rewritten several times. So it ends up a little bit of everything CGI, real history, bolt-on American Hero, meandering plot, ho-hum romance. If you want to pass the time with this movie may be count the times you are reminded of other better films.",47 Ronin
121,The_moan_of_all_moans,I will ignore this film in a thousand lives.,2,4 January 2014,"Jobbies, utter jobbies; for those who aren't aware of the word, it is Scottish slang for poo; excrement leaving the body. But what did i expect? It has Keanu Reeves in it. So clearly i am the mug here. He is a mundane actor; he seems to have taken his days as Neo from the Matrix and refused to alter it in any way. His face constantly looking bemused; tilting his head at everything; that little jerk to the side he does; it's ludicrous. And if ever there where a role that Keanu Reeves would look ridiculous in, this is it. I remember on several occasions just bursting out with laughter at how stupid he was in this film. And whilst he was embarrassing himself Hiroyuki Sanada was displaying a solid showing of acting. Of course the film would've played out much better if it where in Japanese with subtitles, but of course that would've made Reeves an outcast. They could have cast an actual Japanese speaking actor for the role, but hey let's cast Keanu Reeves and that will in turn destroy the film....oh well. One thing i will say is that he is lucky that actors do not share the same tradition as the samurai, because surely his shame at being involved in such a crap film would have drove him to killing himself. But even with a beheading you wouldn't know the difference as his face shows absolutely no emotion...ever.The film is extremely lacklustre and only the action scenes salvage some sort of enjoyment. And the 3D; oh god the 3D, in the opening scenes you are bombarded with things popping out everywhere and you really don't know where to look and BOOM; here comes a headache. The after that it's a branch here, a flake of snow there, some random person passing by... And then the big finale substitutes that headache into a migraine. Aside from a few enjoyable (but head bursting scenes) action scenes, for me it was an absolute horror show.",47 Ronin

123,marydm-43470,The critics are wrong,10,21 May 2021,"There's more natural nobility in Keanu's little finger than in all the sour grape critics put together. It stinks of a conspiracy when a bunch of the usual Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB suspects, er crits, sound like echoes of each other. It's like a schoolyard bully competition trying to be the smart alec with the best put down punchline. These crits are not engaging with the cinematic, dramatic and narrative aspects of the film, they're busy navel gazing and listening to their own voices: how clever am I to have put it like this, eh?The movie is a fantasy based on Japanese folk lore, not a realistic Harold Pinter or Tennessee Williams or any other 20th century self conscious and smug and self indulgent ""psychological"" play. Of course the characters are stock ones, of course there are exaggerated fantastical elements, of course it's not a 21st century psychodrama. It's a fable!Not that the characters are not pretty believable in the context of such a tale. The cast is almost uniformly superb, acting their hearts out and yes some of the Japanese lords and nobles are a tad formal and stiff, they're in the Kabuki tradition, FHS! Fancy having Kabuki elements in a movie set in historical Japan!But Keanu and Hiroyuki and Rinko are completely natural in their roles and are huge assets to the whole enterprise.The film is visually splendid, remember when the very definition of ""flicks"" was spectacle, before the arthouse tragics
hijacked cinema to service their pretentious pseudo-intellectual little obsessions? Well, while I appreciate a good arthouse movie, a rare occurrence BTW, I refuse to apologise for enjoying a piece of traditional cinematic spectacle.And there's much to enjoy here. It's a fast moving tale of far away times and places and mores, and the cast do their damnedest to honour that tale. The cinematography is great, the editing effective, the costumes and mise en scene terrific. Pretty high production values all round.As for identity obsessed comments re Keanu being a ""white"" and thus having the whole film ""whitewashed"", the stupidity of that approach to movies doesn't deserve to be addressed.Look at the state of the world with identity politics centre stage. It's ""acting"" FHS!A great movie to watch and enjoy on Netflix in your PJs after a hard day. Well done everyone.",47 Ronin
124,DaegT,A splendid combination of East & West,8,4 March 2021,"There could be a thousand similar stories and plots out there but not all the films are made the same. I feel graceful after watching it, coz this one shines. All elements are properly balanced so that the 2-hours film is iterally flawless. Take it to the bank.BTW, I can see the tattoo guy in many of the film promotions (posters, etc) but how comes his role in the film is so.... brief??",47 Ronin
125,MovieSonic,Really entertaining and beautiful film,8,22 March 2014,"It's entertaining. It wasn't a masterpiece and definitely wasn't original but there are ways this film managed to surprise for example, by not having a predictable ending, by having great special effects and some great acting. There's a lot of action and there are many visually stunning scenes. The actors were all fantastic and I genuinely cared about what happened to them. I read one review where the reviewer wasn't happy about the way Asian culture is portrayed and the 'Caucasian' guy being at the centre.Well, the 'Caucasian' guy in the film (Keanu Reeves) is actually playing the 'half-breed' as he's referred to and there is relevance to this with regards to the plot. Also, Keanu isn't really the central character. In a typical Hollywood film, he would be I'm sure but in this film, it's actually Hiroyuki Sanada who has more screen time (or seems to have from my perspective). I think some viewers may not understand the benefit of, or the thinking behind, having a famous Hollywood actor in a film i.e. the attention it brings. How many people can honestly say they would have watched this or even known about it if Keanu's name weren't attached? At least he doesn't take over the film and others are allowed to shine instead. Plus, Keanu does have credibility given his ethnic background and although he is a westerner I don't feel that his presence in this film is as horrifying as say, Tom Cruise's in a Samurai film! Just my opinion.I would say I enjoyed this film about as much as I enjoyed Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013), maybe a little bit more.I give this 8/10 for pure enjoyment factor.",47 Ronin
126,Ed-from-HI,Visually Impressive & Entertaining but leaves viewers Wishing for deeper cultural-insights...,8,7 June 2019,"I missed this when it was shown in theaters in 2013 and had to watch more recently on Blu-ray - I think I missed it originally mainly because it had mixed to negative critics reviews, and was generating very poor box-office (in America and in Japan?) - the main reason I watched it recently is because I realized one of the film's lead female Stars (portraying Lord Asano's sublimely-beautiful daughter) is Ko Shibasaki (who was fantastic in the Japanese-made films 'Dororo' and also the popular cult-film 'Battle Royale') I had recently re-watched 'Dororo' and was amazed by how entertaining that film (based on Osamu Tezuka's imaginative-concept) is + how charismatic, intriguing & multi-layered the performance by Ko Shibasaki was and how she was perfectly-cast as the feisty-indomitable and mischievous 'Dororo'!In any event, having now re-watched this Hollywood version of '47-Ronin' (on Bluray to take in the full-effect of magnificent-visuals) I have to say that this movie is much better than either the negative critiques or weak box-office would lead you to believe.The film is by no means perfect (and the pacing does sometimes feel awkward and even a bit disjointed in parts and there is definitely an overreliance on bizarre CGI-monsters & demons that can seem over-the-top (since the original '47-Ronin' story also referred to as 'Chushingura' in Japanese films is based on historical fact) and a more faithful-adherence to the Classic-original-Japanese tale of selfless-Loyalty would have actually been more effective, carrying with it genuine emotional-resonance (thru authenticity)What partially makes-up for many of this film's shortcomings (in terms of realistic Story & narrative) = are the impressively-vibrant &colorful (Large-scale) set-designs and costumes that evoke the uniquely Japanese blend of richly-intricate visual-artistry combined with perfectly-balanced aesthetics (as interpreted in this film by mostly Western artisans & designers - amazingly)The extra-features on Bluray detail the incredibly painstaking (and obviously expensive) lengths the director, set-conceptualists, and costume designers went in order to fully-communicate that sense of visual-wonder and transcendent-beauty that has been so intrinsic to Japanese culture & Art for many Centuries now.That's the good news.......... the not so good aspects of this film can be summarized as follows:
Too many CGI demonic 'creatures' to cope with, plus elements of evil supernatural mysticism/witchcraft = this actually detracts from and dampens the powerful 'heart' of the original '47 Samurai/Ronin' 'Chushingura' Story that has remained a Classic Japanese 'morality-play' and ultimate tale of selfless-dedication and loyalty to a just leader and cause = a tale much more about boundless inner-strength & resolute-dedication (in pursuit of ultimate Peace for wronged restless-souls) it is not inherently a supernatural-tale about slaying fire-breathing flying-serpents or besting satanic-witches.......Bottom-line: this is a Super-impressive film from the standpoints of visual-Creativity and fantastic design-elements effectively transporting the viewer to a boundlessly fascinating and endlessly-intriguing Time & Place (i.e. Japan in the early 1700s) - but it could have been infinitely more! Unlike the superior (and philosophical) Edward Zwick film 'The Last Samurai' --- Hollywood's '47-Ronin' seems to lack the depth-of-insight into the full-range of intriguing Japanese culture & Zen philosophy, and could have even benefitted from a deeper-dive into 'Bushido' of course with more of the 'human' elements needing to be explored & revealed!",47 Ronin
127,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - 47 Ronin,7,10 January 2014,"47 Ronin is a film reimagining of a popular Japanese folktale that is stuck inside its mythic contraptions. Everybody is an archetype, as opposed to a character. Love, hate or brotherhood between characters is assumed rather than shown through character development. The story starts and ends with an unknown narrator, who tells the story as if we were all listening to a old tale by a campfire. The end result is that it places a distance between the story and the audience. It is as if the story itself is matted on a frame, and we are just looking at it in a gallery with a curator recounting the story as opposed to the viewer experiencing the story from a first-person perspective.Keanu Reeves is not the problem here. There is no room here to critique about woodiness as there wasn't enough for him to do. He is casted here for marketing reasons and it really shows. Reeves' character is sidelined by Hiroyuki Sanada, who plays the leader of the Ronin. Sanada carries the film with his powerful presence; you really do believe he can really hurt someone with a sword. He has long been the go-to guy for American-Japanese co-productions and it's finally nice to see him in a central role. Tadanobu Asano also shows up to chew some scenery as the villain and adds a depth that wasn't on the page. My fingers are still crossed he will play Genghis Khan again in a sequel to Mongul.Hearing the film opened poorly in Japan is unfortunate. Perhaps it is uncomfortable for the Japanese to see their own folktale retold in a foreign production. I have bulked at my fair share of Hollywood misrepresentations of Chinese culture, and evidently there is a sufficient amount of Orientalism in the film. Though the fantasy elements and the production design are so extreme it plays closer to a graphic novel. The more I think about why the fantasy elements were added, the more it seems like it is there to justify the casting of Keanu Reeves as a half- Caucasian half-Japanese outsider amongst an entire cast of Japanese actors. I can't help but imagine what a more realistic telling of this story would have been like as the Japanese cultural elements and Samurai politics were more interesting than the magic and mythic beasts.To sum it all up, 47 Ronin is a fantasy graphic novel style adaptation of a Japanese folktale released in December. Perhaps it is not exactly the most festive way to start the new year with all the beheadings and Samurai ritual suicide. The story also takes a long time to get set up, which asks for a lot of patience on the viewer's part. The ideal crowd would have been overseas anime geeks who are fascinated with Japanese pop culture, and perhaps for that, the film may have fared better if it was released in the March-April slot. That all said, even with its flaws and supposed qualifiers, 47 Ronin accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's just not for everybody.",47 Ronin
128,baumhenrik,Keanu is in this,6,16 October 2019,Overall this movie isn't bad but there were some things that didn't needed to be done. For example the whacky visual effects in the last battle scenes when all their swords made these little swooshs like in Star Wars (the swoosh of the yellow monk guys is quite cool though). The story wasn't very complex or new but it was a solid base for the movie. The fight scenes are well done and the few CGI Creatures shown in this movie are mostly well done. Still I have high expectations for a samurai movie since there aren't that many good ones especially from the last 20 years.,47 Ronin
129,hazysistersunshine33,A Pretty good movie and a great legend,7,8 June 2014,"I heard some of this was based on a legend or a true story or something. Obviously, there are something's like witches and spells and supernatural things in it that weren't true, but if the other realistic stuff was true, what a great legend. Keanu Reeves plays a ""half breed"" white and Japanese outcast who ends up becoming a samurai to help his fellow samurai go and kill the guy who killed their leader. They do this against the king will, so they are no longer samurai, but Ronin. That's pretty much it. There's a crazy witch involved and spells and stuff like that, as I said. There are some double crosses and battle sequences that are pretty amazing, especially the one at the end. The visuals are pretty neat and well done. The acting was good all around, by everyone. I always thought this movie should've done a little better in the theaters. It was surprisingly better than I thought it would be.",47 Ronin
130,kuuk3,Misleading advertising and the worst ending ever!,2,30 December 2013,"Firstly, ignore the poster. It shows a tattooed man who has one line in the entire movie and is never seen again. It shows a big metal Samurai who was set-up to have a big end battle with but was ultimately wasted. A women with half a breast out, which doesn't happen in the film, and is missing ALL of the 47 Ronin, who this film is about!The trailer suggested some Supernatural fantasy epic, when really its just your standard Japanese war film, with a dragon making an appearance with no explanation for whatsoever at the very end for a minute. At no point was it even mentioned that this 'witch' could do what she did. Basically, when the writer needed to make the film more interesting or to get themselves out of a plot hole, they just gave this character another new power like Spider blood bonding, which again, had no impact on the story. Then we have the ending. Call it what you want - I found it insulting. It completely negated the entire film and the struggle they went through. The main villain of the film gets away with his crimes, and all their hard-work was for nought. These people had families, jobs and commitments at home. There just going to forget all that? Where's the honour in abandoning the people who depended on them? It makes no sense, and I really cant believe that if this is based on a true story, that not a single person in 47 didn't say 'wait a minute' (and yes, I use the English words as apparently we all speak the same language). Im ignoring the American white guy is the only one that can save the world part of the story, or his powers which again, are only used when it serves the writers progression of a scene, rather than when he would have actually found them useful. They also live in a world with guns, in fact they are actually shot with them several times. So why would they go looking for swords after that? Especially when they know the enemy has magic powers and a much bigger fully armed army. When your outmatched with numbers and magic, surely when you ask your 'special friends' for weapons, you ask for a rocket launcher, rather than a sword, which for the record, were being dropped on the ground every ten seconds. It would have been easier just to pick them up. The film had its moments for sure, and maybe modern western culture has my thinking slanted on this film, but the ending really ruined it for me. I know it must have been part of the original story and they want to stay true to the source material, but Im finding that the hardest thing to forgive.",47 Ronin
131,slayerjmk95,An Entertaining Samurai Epic That Falls Short,7,12 December 2013,"47 Ronin is a highly fictionalized take on the story of the 47 ronin who took revenge on a court official who had the 47's leader commit seppuku. In the film, Keanu Reeves portrays Kai, a half-British Half-Japanese outcast who is called upon by Oishi, the leader of the 47. The 47 seek revenge on Lord Kira, who also has an evil witch (Rinko Kikuchi) serving under him, who killed their master.The movie itself looks absolutely phenomenal, with amazing visual effects, an emotional and gripping musical score, and strong performances from Keanu and Hiroyuki Sanada, who portrays Oishi. The major problem that i saw with the movie was that, it was over way too fast. They left out important character development for the witch and a few other characters, which really could have added more emotional flame to the film. Plus, the movie overall could have easily been twenty, thirty minutes longer. If it were, i would say it can rank alongside 13 Assassins and The Last Samurai. The script was well-written in terms of dialogue (some cheesy lines), but the overall script was devoid of real depth and thought. Then, Carl Erik Rinsch's directing was actually pretty good, but had a few too many cut-aways.47 Ronin is an extremely action-packed samurai/fantasy epic that is something you don't want to miss on the big-screen (for a cheap price). Though, if you want to see something award-worthy in terms of writing and directing, hope for a Director's/Extended cut on disc, for you won't find it here. But great performances, visual effects and emotion really help make this movie stand out, even with The Desolation of Smaug as competition.",47 Ronin
132,dschlatter,weird advertising,6,14 February 2014,"I gave it a six, because it was an overall pretty entertaining movie. Entertaining, but in the end forgettable. The effects were decent, the costumes and cinematography was beautiful. I missed well-choreographed sword fights. I would have happily traded some of the CGI for some old-school fighting. But that's just me. What I found odd was ""Zombie Boy"". Odd to say the least! The poster leads you to believe that his character is of some kind of importance to the story. I mean, he is the second biggest person on the friggin' poster! So what does he do in the movie? Absolutely nothing!! How on earth did he make it a) into the trailer and b) on the poster? Was this just a marketing gag to sell more tickets? Well, as you can see on box office-mojo.com... it didn't pay work. Personally, I couldn't care less whether or not he had played a vital part of the story instead of this nothing-role that he did play. I'm just thinking: Was Jason Statham on the Collateral poster? No! Was Will Ferrell on the Internship poster? No! I could go on and on...Please leave the poster-space for those who actually matter. Please! That would be all... Bye!",47 Ronin

I felt though that there could have been more to the story, simple and clichéd in some areas but overall an enjoyable film. Keanu does a decent job with his part but the true meat and potatoes comes from Hiroyuki Sanada, who does a masterful job in his portrayal as the chief ronin, Ôishi . The true pleasure and joy within this film is its nod and ode to the ancient Japanese mythology of the time, which in my opinion is done very well. Some may not understand the conclusion of this film but in a little learned knowledge of the culture one would see it for what it was intended for..

137,ericnottelling,Brilliant for a bad film,4,18 January 2014,"Let me start off by saying how I appreciated them hiding Keanu Reeves in the script as much as possible. He is in lots of action scenes but they keep his actual talking to a minimum. Probably because as most people suspect, he can't act. Not so much in the body language but when he opens his mouth you just go omg it's so bad just shut up. They really did away with his bad acting by making him virtually a stunt double, which saved the film from him making it any worse than it already is. The main dialog is taking place through everyone but him! Which was probably the only thing this movie got right! The movie goes rather fast although some parts of it seem just unnecessary almost like they are trying to fill in some time. Other parts of the movie seem incredibly stupid. I won't give any spoilers away but you will sit there and go OK this is ignorant mainly at the ending. I know they want to make is historically accurate, but seriously if they wanted to do that they should have gotten rid of the witchcraft thing. If you are going to go Hollywood, then go Hollywood. You can't do this half and half mess with such a bad ending. Lastly, they rely way to much on this whole suicide honor thing. Like every 10 minutes it's a ""you could kill yourself"" moment. It's so old and boring that by the time they get to the end it's just worn out. 4/10, would never pay to see it in the theater, maybe on netflix in the future sometime. That's the best it deserves.",47 Ronin

Cuz, ya know, films with demonic shapeshifters are truly expected to be historically accurate.Maybe I should mark this as a spoiler, but ... there are no shapeshifting demon/witches in the real world. Seriously, folk. It's a mythic retelling of an event. Deal with it.On the positive side, the film had some beautifully composed shots. The atmosphere is heavy, tragic, serious.

I have no agenda other than to give you the best idea about a movie before you watch it.I liked this movie. It's not great but not horrible. Reeves is reeves and does a good job. The rest of the cast is good as well. It is NOT a super action flick. It has some good action in it tho and a little sword and sorcery flair.It is a good story of 47 ronins that went to avenge their master. I'm not sure I would have gone to the theater to see this one but if your renting a vid for home viewing well worth the time especially if you like a movie with some Japanese/samurai flavor. again no Oscars here but the movie looks good and the story is good not raving original but done wellAnyone says this movie sucks is lying or has a grudge with reeves or somethingAnyone says this movie is great is lying or over thinking it.

141,taz1004,Garbage,1,28 April 2014,"I rarely write reviews unless the movie is very good. This movie is the first one I write review on because it was so bad. Reeves is not well known for his acting but in this movie, he seemed like he deserve an Oscar because all other acting was far worse than him. Couldn't even understand half of what the Japanese were saying in English. Story was plain and depiction of Japanese honor is laughable. Vast majority of samurai were criminals with no honor.""Despite the rampant romanticism of the 20th century, samurai could be disloyal and treacherous (e.g., Akechi Mitsuhide), cowardly, brave, or overly loyal (e.g., Kusunoki Masashige)"" Source: WikipediaIt's actually getting tired of Hollywood romanticizing these murderous criminals along with ninjas who were nothing more than cheap assassins.",47 Ronin
142,SerpentMage,Seriously people this movie is pretty good,8,24 June 2014,"Oh come on people! I was not expecting much from this movie. Keanu Reeves tends not to be the most ""dramatic"", or ""intensive"" kind of actor. However, Keanu Reeves is a flexible role actor. In Johnny Mnemonic, Devils Advocate, or even Henry's Crime he shows he is willing to do roles that are different. Namely what I like about Keanu Reeves is that I can be entertained. In this movie what you should get out of it is that you are entertained. Many will critique that the movie is not historically accurate. Well fair enough, but if you know your Japanese History it is full of details and nuances. Thus to do justice to this story you would probably need about 4 to 5 hours, or 2 parts. And I am very sure that while Hollywood could pull it off, it was not in the cards. Not dissing Japanese culture, just pointing out that Japanese culture is very formal, and very nuanced which makes it hard to do accurately in a movie.Of course this movie does not break new ground in the sense of drama, but if you are willing to overlook this movie then you will be entertained.",47 Ronin
143,TheReviewMaster,This is no Monkey Magic,8,14 May 2015,"47 Ronin reminded me of the strange and surreal Japanese movies I used to wake up at midnight and turn the television on to. Although this movie has a very Hollywood vibe to it, with a very Hollywood script and structure, it also feels like it's drenched in so much Japanese mythology the Japanese couldn't have made it better themselves.One thing that impressed me was the creature designs. There were some really different approaches taken to the designs, and I can say I've never seen these types of creatures on a film before.Another impressing aspect is the set and costume design. Both are so colourful and intricate, I felt like I really was in ancient Japan. There were some clever uses of flowing dresses and if I were a cross-dresser having one of those dresses would be a fun addition to my wardrobe.The score had nice touches to it. Not much thematically, but very much had heart, touching on the themes of love and honour in the story without being too Hollywood and overbearing.And Keanu played Keanu once again, but how can you not like Keanu. It's Ted Theodore Logan, the One, Neo, the guy who stopped a speeding bus from exploding and killing all the passengers, the guy who brought down a gang of surfing bank robbers, now he's back and being all honourable with swords and kung-fu.Great movie, great special effects and although the story has been done before in many ways, there is enough in here to call it different.",47 Ronin

145,jdgan,Disrespectful and Insulting,3,26 May 2020,"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. It was a big mistake as this is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. The pacing is wonky, the editing wasn't that great and the acting felt rushed, like someone had rewritten the script while they were filming and they had to quickly re-shoot it to save time.Which brings me to what happened behind the scenes, which is a story that makes this attempt to tell the old Japanese folk tale downright disgusting and the film's worst flaw. The film started out with a way smaller budget, with Chris Morgan (Fast and Furious) writing an actually good Black List script and Carl Rinsch at the directors helm; Keanu Reeves wasn't the main character, it was gonna stick close to the original tale, and Rinsch was inspired by Kingdom of Heaven and Gladiator. Sadly, Universal saw an early cut of the film and didn't like it, as they wanted it to be a fantasy film akin to Avatar and responded by hiring Hossein Amini (Drive, Snow White and the Huntsman, The Snowman). Rinsch was then sadly forced to re-shoot some of the film, including having Keanu Reeves as the main character, adding CGI and re-tweaking the marketing; all of this caused the film to go over budget up to around $225 Million; this culminated in the director being fired for ""going over budget"", essentially making him the scapegoat and tanking his career. That is sad since I loved the director's previous work (The Gift was amazing) and honestly, I think he should get another chance at directing.That being said though, there are some positives to the film. Ilan Eshkeri's score is the most underrated aspect of the film and it's the element that always draws me in. There are some moments that show Rinsch's skill as a director, and some of the effects are great. But apart from those, that's about it.In conclusion, this is a film that could have been great but sadly this is another film ruined by Universal Pictures.",47 Ronin
146,eatfirst,A flawed but still partially entertaining attempt to marry historical drama to epic fantasy.,5,30 December 2013,"A dopey but passably diverting fantasy take on a genuine event in Japanese feudal history. The story of the 47 Ronin who avenge the honour-induced suicide of their former lord is widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent examples of Bushido (the samurai code of chivalric values) in Japanese history and has passed, somewhat embellished, into a wide range of literature and arts, having been filmed at least six times before. But I'll wager none of those versions included a shape-shifting witch-dragon lady.In this first (and probably last) Hollywood stab at the tale, Keanu Reeves comes billed as the star of the piece playing an outcast half-breed which is one of the many inventions added to this version of the tale and most likely intended as a familiarisation waypoint for western audiences. Stoic and ultra-serious he's not actually too bad, but neither the role as written, nor the screen time really allow him to make much of an impact. Thank goodness then for Hiroyuki Sanada as the ronin leader Oishi. One of the just about every well-known English-speaking Japanese actors that have been harvested for this production, he shoulders the bulk of the drama with capable authority, and along with Rinko Kikuchi's deliriously absurd wicked witch, ensures that at least a few engaging characters emerge from the CGI hailstorm.Relatively unknown director Carl Rinsch struggles to marry the serious tone of the human drama to the Tolkien-esque fantasy romping, and as such the film lurches around, uncertain of what it wants to be. That said, some individual scenes are impressive, he and his DP have clearly spent a productive afternoon watching late-period Kurosawa and the courtly and battlefield scenes have a beautiful, symmetrical formality to them.Not the disaster that the initial critical drubbing might suggest, this is no worse than most of the Narnia movies, or second-tier Wuxia fantasy such as Reign of Assassins, but then outside of Japan it doesn't have the franchise brand selling power of the former, and the latter sure didn't cost 175 million dollars to make. Ouch.",47 Ronin
147,sadak7599,"Not as bad as expected, but still not nearly good, and the fantasy crap ruin a good story",4,13 December 2019,"The legend of 47 ronin, based on a true story, is a classic japanese epic tale. The original story is exciting, flexible enough and a good opportunity to make a nice epoch movie, packed with action, martial arts, epics, drama and samurai classic stuff.
It was really necessary to create a non-existent magical Japan with LOTR-alike landscapes, and fill it up with monsters, magic, witchery, and unnecessary and (on occasions) cringe crap? Maybe the writers thought that original japanese aesthetics and story is not enough to satisfy the low-intelligence average occidental viewer and needed to convert the story in something without authenticity or personality, closer to a bad epic saga novels for teens. This lack of authenticity is showed in the flat, sub-standard acting. Good actors were wasted in schematic dialogues and robotic acting. Even the action scenes are average, lacking the tension and respect of other samurai films, being more intended for the younger viewers.Apart of the self-indulgent fantasy world recreation, the story loss the tension and epics of the original story (epics which was forced using the standard techniques of bad directors, like slow motion accompanied with average dramatic music), lost in the colorful videogame-ish aesthetics. The movie doesn't flow well, is confusing, boring sometimes, and the Keanu character, inexistent in the original legend, was shoehorned in the story. If the producers thought that japanese stars were not enough for the occidental market, well, Keanu have an oriental look and could have been a nice Horibe Yasubei, for example.In my opinion, a wasted opportunity. This movie could have been a modern classic and a cult movie (think about 13 assassins, of Miike). Actually, it is just a nearly forgotten fantasy average flick.",47 Ronin

All the Japanese actors speak engrish (some might be Chinese)and put Neo as the hero of the movie.It feels a mess, they tried to adapt a real life 47 ronin story, make it into a romantic tragedy and turn it into mythological. It would be fine if they stuck to history or make it a movie on its own. Might as well change the ending if most of the movie is made up.I wouldn't even recommend it even for a b grade movie it should be scrapped.

150,filmfanperspective,KKKKKKK-Kai Sharona! (*),2,5 May 2015,"I'm no genius, but I'm guessing that if you need to showcase a man with real body-covering tattoos to sell your movie, but he's only in one scene, your movie might not be able to stand on its' own merits. Such is the case with the dreadful '47 Ronin', a lavishly produced movie that seems to believe it is a standard-bearer for the genre, when the reality is quite embarrassing for everyone involved. A $175 million production budget does not guarantee that the result will pop off the screen as it should, nor does it guarantee more than wooden performances from the cast. It guarantees nothing, which is precisely what I took from this film. It does not offer an original thought, and interesting idea, or perhaps the most damning statement of all, it does not offer anything worthy of deeming it cool.The core story is a common one for those interested in Japanese history/mythology. A shogun rules the land with an iron fist, and various villages offer up tributes to their ruler in the form of samurai battles. The village of Ako is unique in that their governor/magistrate Lord Asano is benevolent, and even took in a ""half-breed"" boy they found in the apparently demon-infested forest. This boy, named Kai (Reeves), has powers-we're not sure why or how, but he could be a warrior. I have no idea if the story behind Kai means anything, or in the end where he comes from, and to be honest, who cares?The film's turning point occurs when Lord Asano is betrayed by Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) from another village or province. Kira uses a witch (Kikuchi), who can apparently conjure up poisonous spiders and shape-shift into a dragon and a smiling fox. Yes, a smiling fox- not entirely unlike the viral video. This witch sends her conjured spider to pee poison (basically) on Lord Asano's lips, and thus cause him to do unruly things. These actions bring disgrace upon Ako, meaning Asano must, ahem, relieve himself of duty. Thusly, the samurai that serve under him no longer have a master, and are considered 'ronin'. After some time, these ronin, headed by Oishi (Sanada), seek to avenge their master using overly choreographed fight scenes and blades acquired from snake-men that have an unclear link to Kai. Are you lost yet? Does it really matter how they get from point A to B? I certainly had a hard time caring after witnessing all the ridiculousness.First-time director Carl Rinsch doesn't know which film to make here (if one can even consider it his in the end). It's stylish, for sure. One can see, stylistically, why Ridley Scott originally tabbed him to direct ""Prometheus"". In fact, the film's redeeming qualities are in the beauty of the locations and costumes. What it lacks is a cleardirection. Is it trying to be a mystical action film, or a historical epic? If it's an action film, why is the action boring? If it's a historical epic, why did the filmmakers bother to get an all-Japanese supporting cast and then have them speak English the entire film? There's an obvious parallel to this, a film done so well that this pales in comparison- ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Ang Lee understood what type of film that should be, and dare I say ""47 Ronin"" may have been a far superior film with an experienced director.At its' best, ""47 Ronin"" is dull, by-the-numbers, and simply exists. At its' worst, it's completely non-sensical and uninterested in paying respects to the cultural heritage to which it belongs. Just to make sure they kick Japanese mythology in the teeth for good measure, Gedde Watanabe makes an appearance as the leader of an acting troupe. This is the same actor who portrayed Long Duk Dong in ""Sixteen Candles"", quite possibly one of the most racially stereotyped characters in cinema history. Maybe everyone involved with this meant well, but the result is powerfully embarrassing. There isn't enough style to carry the lack of substance, creating a miserable, confusing experience that results in one of the worst films of the year.",47 Ronin

(Hagakure happens to be my favorite book of all time, which stems from one of my favorite movies of all time, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.) So, you'd think this would be an easy formula for a 5 out of 5, right? Not quite.Pros - The movie is visually beautiful. The costumes and armors are stunning, and the locales are fantastic.Although it's a very over-the-top re-imaging of the classic tale, they treat the source material with a loving respect, which is well appreciated. How can anyone not love Rinko Kikuchi? She does an awesome job. - This movie clocks in at 2 hours, and keeps a pretty consistent pace throughout.Seriously. I want one of those Tengu swords.Cons - In my opinion, this movie SUFFERS from being PG-13. While the fight scenes and choreography are done nicely, the editing and camera-work take away from many of the battles, making the fights seem short and choppy. I get it... PG-13 = more viewers = more $$$, but I would have loved to have been able to see the stark and dramatic visuals of these fights against the backdrop of such beautiful settings. It would have given everything much more impact.Keanu Reeves...I...I just don't know how to feel about your performance. Look, it's obvious that you did your homework on this, and the respect and reverence you carry for this story comes through, and you have the action-lead pedigree, but...there's just something...off...about you in this role. I can't put my finger on it...it just wasn't a perfect fit for me.I feel like they actually dialed it back when it comes to the special effects here. Those Tengu sword light-streak effects? The huge supernatural beasts? Why couldn't we get some more of that in? I appreciate the less-is-more concept, and not every action movie has to smash you over the head with special effects a la Thor or The Hobbit, but I would've been cool with a pinch more of the SFX thrown in...Listen, in no way was 47 Ronin a bad movie. It was good. Very good, I'd say. But I wanted it to be GREAT. I wanted to 5 out of 5 this one so badly.

152,JohnnyWeissmuller,47 Ronin,4,25 October 2015,"47 Ronin is terribly flawed, but does have some great moments and an enticing premise that hits and misses. One's enjoyment of this film will hinge predominantly on the cast, the idea and whether you will allow enough goodwill to overlook far too much exposition, poor pacing, clichés abound and some fair-to-middling CGI. But this is more akin to the Lone Ranger and Pirates of the Caribbean than Kurosawa or Hiroshi Inagaki' s classic film version of the 47 Ronin story. However, it's also hurt by a lack if humour, which wouldn't have gone amiss given how stern the tone remains throughout. There's also a sense of dread that's lacking, whilst excitement never builds to a real frenzy in spite of gargantuan samurai foes, dragons, demons and witches. But the story of a half-breed outcast who lives like a slave and works alongside samurai worked for me, and was supposed to provide a credible reason for the casting of Keanu Reeves in the leading role. And he brings a lot to the role, especially a terrific physical presence and martial arts ability that's a joy to watch -- particularly in a fight scene with the great Hiroyuki Sanada, that was worth the price of admission alone for me. Sanada is well cast and reliable here as the samurai retainer and head of the 47 ronin; and what's appreciable here, is that Reeves, despite his star-billing, is never pushed to the fore. He's a pariah who become respected and part of a band, but isn't there to be first and foremost in every scene. Tadanobu Asano was also well cast as the scheming Lord Kira, whilst Rinko Kikuchi's slinky, wicked witch is an insanely brilliant creation. And I relished in watching actors whom I like so much playing it up broadly with such a colourful and often vibrant spectacle. I wanted more, though; and don't think the end result, despite its flaws and virtues, is entirely robust. But I still liked it and greatly admire Keanu Reeves for sticking with a project that really needed a better director to flourish. Unfortunately, this seems to be tanking in every market, and although it's been well advertised, I haven't seen Reeves promoting a film that's alienating Japanese audiences and holds little interest in the subject matter for western audiences.",47 Ronin

154,Horror-88,Not Japanese...,4,28 October 2016,"""My father taught me this world was only a preparation for the next, that all we can ask is that we leave it having loved and being loved.""For someone whose favourite movie is 'The Last Samurai', I thought I would very much enjoy this movie. I was wrong. It's actually a very dull action movie for 13 years and under who may have also enjoyed 'The Hobbit 3'. It's pretty basic. Samurai (oh, sorry - 'Ronin') argue, get into fight, lose fight, try again, get a sacred weapon, lose fight, win fight. That's pretty much it. The mystical aspects in the movie felt out of place and unnecessary. The CGI seemed cheap and needless. If the story was about Ronin returning to save their homeland, why add in ridiculous magic creatures? Now, I'm not into the ""if we have a Japanese movie, we HAVE to have a Japanese protagonist"", as I loved the Last Samurai, which had Tom Cruise as the lead, but in that movie, it made sense. It was part of the plot. A Western man learns Japanese ways. Yet in '47 Ronin', there's no good reason for a non-Japanese lead actor. So Keanu Reaves just should have been replaced.The ending, as it was perhaps the only unique aspect of this movie, felt out of place. Won't say what happened, but let's say that the entire movie was not a gritty movie, but it had an out-of- place gritty ending. Even if children enjoyed this movie, they wouldn't enjoy the ending, thus they removed their only potential fan-base. Overall, a bad imitation of 'The Last Samurai' that just doesn't work. It didn't feel very Japanese at all to be honest. If you really want to watch a samurai movie, you should watch it, but leave your mind behind, because it's basically your unintelligent action movie.",47 Ronin

It kind of seems like he misses doing Matrix movies given the nature of the film. However having said that I did find it strange the movie wasn't subtitled. I guess they figured no one would see it because people can only read face-book and twitter statuses these days. It had a bit more story than I expected. I kind of expected more fighting. Some parts were predictable. I did like the female shape-shifter. She was probably the most interesting character to me. The creature creation was nice once you actually got to see them. Quite frankly it was a little Avatar, a little Elektra and a little Last Samurai meets Hidden dragon crouching tiger only not as good as any of those.

156,The-Plague,A band of Samurai set out on a mission for vengeance.,5,12 June 2014,"This film takes true Japanese events from the 18th century and turns them into a Fantasy type film. I am a fan of Fantasy films, but I can't help but wonder why they decided to add that element. I think the original, true story, was not only interesting, but emotionally compelling. This average guy wanted to grab a Samurai sword and go on an adventure when he heard the original story of the 47 Ronin. The movie version however did not exactly make me want to grab a Samurai swordcouldn't even make me pick up a butter knife. It did not compel me, nor did it make me feel much emotion whatsoever. It wasn't bad, just bland like an unseasoned Chili.I have always had a soft spot for Keanu Reeves. I grew up watching his movies, but I do notice he has a bad habit of taking on acting roles that just aren't suitable for him. His character, which was one of about three that had any character development or back story just wasn't someone you would fight for; there was no screaming at the T.V. ""You got this man! You can win!"" It was more so, this is cool to watch, effects aren't bad, but do I really care? There were only 47 of them, yet they never really seemed outnumbered, so I never really got excited to see them fight. I would rather see one man fight five men Bruce Lee style than boring one on one combat, even though they are supposed to be outnumbered 1000 to 47.What it lacked in substance in its center it nearly made up for in action. There were a few exciting scenes, nothing to write home about, but worth talking about to a few friends at the bar. I think that some of the writing was good. Keanu's character had one line that is sure to get a girl to come home with you, he was indeed a smooth operator. While most of this review seems negative, it still was watchable.

First and foremost the movie should not have been in English and should have stuck to Japanese language with subtitles. The reason being that at times the dialogue feels so robotic and so out of place. The second is the atmosphere/setting of the story. It tries to be a fantasy shying away from the real world but it doesn't do enough of it nor being real. The script/screenplay is not the best at all. It feels so B movie rated.The background on the characters are severely lacking and leaves the viewer empty to any attachment of any sort. I believe it makes good actors/actresses bad. The English language on the females must be the worst, not because of it actually but because it makes them terribly bad at acting. I'm not sure if it's because they don't know how to react to the dialogues or what but it is very annoying to watch.

Unfortunately the fighting scenes, although well choreographed, suffers from having a very low rating of 12A which essentially means it is suitable for lower teens. This means, no blood and no gore, at all. And for a movie, which is centered around samurais, is simply devastating.Second the acting is ranging from average, Keanu Reeves, to pretty horrible by some of the other of the 47 Ronin and the main bad guy, who does his best to look mean, fails miserably.Finally the CGI is pretty bad and you can see that some of the monsters are clearly rendered and do not look real, at all.

161,ted-peterson,A Great and Powerful Legend: Ignore The Man Behind the Movie,2,16 March 2014,"Spoiler Alert: Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. Headline: American movie makers destroy beloved and historically important Japanese legend: Samurai honor and tradition dishonored. It could have been an interesting movie. I first heard about Ronin and Samurai and the tradition after watching ""Seven Samurai"" in the early '60s. I was blown away by the story and was unaware that it was a ten-year old movie. Since then, I have been a fan of Japanese period dramas based around the Samurai tradition. It's hard to go wrong when Japanese mythology is mixed with historical drama. A few years ago, there was a movie set in Europe, called ""Ronin"" in the movie was a character who was building a diorama of the legend of 47 Ronin. According to the character in the movie the legend was at the core of Japanese militarism. This movie sets out to give legs to an important tale but is so loaded with mythical elements that the line between fact and fiction doesn't make sense. This movie doesn't either. Keanu Reeves must have fallen in love with himself after ""Matrix."" He's so in love with himself that he can cast himself in the middle of a decent historical tale that attempts to highlight many of the reasons that Japanese are and should be proud of their heritage. The Shogun, warlord Samurai/Ronin heritage is profoundly interesting and full of life-affirming lessons. It's a history full of treachery, honor and the power of societal structure. A while back Tom Cruise took a stab at Japanese mythology and history with ""The Last Samurai"" and I think, overall, it was a better effort. In this movie, the Japanese aren't capable of understanding the mythical elements around them and must be led by an unlikely half-breed hero who was the lowly result of an English sailor and Japanese prostitute. Is this part of the tale? Nope. The tale does deal with revenge, betrayal and the basic structure of Japanese royal society. And an important tale it is. The 47 Ronin ranks up there with Shakespeare and Donne and Chaucer. In other words, it gibes us a glimpse, through the art of storytelling, into the core beliefs and driving impetus of culture. In that way, the Reeves character was a total waste of time and energy. Why was the movie given this direction? One remote possibility is that the Japanese are centric people to the point of fascism. There is a reason that Bobby Fisher found sanctuary in Japan after he became a vehement hater of Jews. It's possible that the Reeves character was put into the legend to show that good things can come from insignificant people who are the victims of prejudice. But then, why have the movie in English? The whole period of Western involvement in Japan must be like the blitz was to Londoners: It's just something that's so traumatic that it still reverberates today. The movie is a mess. The Japanese character actors did a great job and the mythical elements are fun to watch. But it's all so pat and American-movie kitsch that any chance at gravity is lost. Real Samurai would have requested that the producers and principles commit Seppuku. I would sharpen the knives. M2. The LARPing in ""The Knights of Badassdom"" was better.",47 Ronin
162,cutesd,Really not as terrible as I thought it would be,5,15 April 2018,"I really think the failure of this film was bad advertising. When I saw the trailers for this film my primary thought was, ""Why is Keanu Reeves in a Samurai movie?"" It felt like white-washing like Great Wall ... it made no sense ... and immediately turned me off from wanting to see the film.What I didn't know ... that the studio REALLY should've emphasized ... is that the main character is half asian and this explains why you'd cast Keanu Reeves ... and kinda makes him perfect for the role. But why they wouldn't bring this up in the trailers is beyond me.The story itself is like a mystical Sho-Gun. It's not original, borrowing from a million stories we've seen before, but the mystical elements are definitely intriguing and the final battle is one of the best choreographed I've seen in a VERY long time.The pacing is poor, the acting is just ok, and I think Americans won't like the ending ... but it wasn't horrible in fact it was much better than I thought it would be.",47 Ronin
163,t-hf,Not as bad as you think it's going to be.,7,23 May 2014,"OK, so before I start, I just want to say some things for those who care or who are stupid enough to believe the contrary based on popular opinion:1. Just because a movie bombs at the box office, it doesn't mean the movie is automatically terrible and that you should stay away from it. In it's broadest sense, a box office bomb just means that the film didn't gain enough interest, was the victim of poor marketing or went up in competition against more popular films in the theatres. It just happens that a lot of box office bombs and in this case, 47 Ronin was up against the likes of The Hobbit 2 and The Wolf of Wall Street, which is a shame because in some ways it is better than the CGI fest that is The Desolation of Smaug.2. Keanu Reeves is not a bad actor!!!! The only people that ever say that are only saying it because they can't get over his comedic performances in the Bill and Ted franchise. Get over it and stop hating on the guy. He has an incredibly stoic and intense charisma that makes him very good to watch. It's just a shame that people think of that charisma as wooden. Granted, he has had bad performances, but he has emerged a very fine actor.3. Just because a white guy features in a predominantly Japanese movie based on Japanese history, it doesn't mean that film is racist. In fact, I found that Keanu Reeves serves very well to represent our westernised eye in the story as a put-upon outcast since the film is obviously marketed to the average western audience.Anyway, those are some common criticisms that have been directed at this movie. 47 Ronin is a surprisingly good action movie with some very impressive fight sequences, although it does have it's flaws as with any movie. So let's dive in. The film mainly concerns a band of samurai that seek vengeance against the people that drove them out of their land. They recruit Kai (Keanu Reeves), a ""half-breed"" who is treated like a bit of a second class citizen. What follows is the 47 Ronin's journey to vanquish their enemies.The main strength that the movie has is it's action sequences. They are very well done and seeing Keanu take on the role of a samurai takes me back to his Matrix days. Also, I found the samurai - not just Keanu - to be very respectable people. They know full well that they may be executed for treason but are hellbent on vanquishing their oppressors regardless. That is an honourable trait that you don't see enough in characters today.However, I will admit that the film does have flaws. For instance, the film seems to take a while to get going and can be boring at times, but once it does get going, you will enjoy what it has to offer. A nuisance is that the film doesn't dedicate much to character development during this time. Keanu's character - despite being a victim of prejudice - seems quite empty and whatever you want to know fundamentally about his character or his character's background doesn't really get said.But make no mistake, the film is entertaining when it can be and turns out to be quite a nice little action movie. It's just a shame that this movie didn't get the creative direction or revenue that it deserved.",47 Ronin

At the end it is a convoluted mess which seem that not even the creators knew what they wanted to to with it.The thing that that bothered me most is that the japanese speak british english (in a closed country to foreigners)
Not necessarly a bad movie, but overall its a real waste of time sadly.",47 Ronin
165,bkbirge,"Overly earnest, takes itself too seriously, but fun also",6,21 March 2014,"This was a fun but forgettable big budget movie with some good stuff going for it but ultimately is bogged down by taking itself way too seriously.The whole concept of honor that this movie revolves around is so outmoded and divorced from the real world and even history that it can be a little cringe inducing to watch. The choices these people make come across as ultimately stupid, not honorable. For a movie that is supposed to portray a culture with a very long view of things this is even more jarring.However, the main lead (not Keanu) is a fantastic actor and Reeves does a good job as the second lead but what brings the movie down is how serious they are. This is a mythical exaggerated tale very loosely based on a real story and they tried to play it real but with supernatural monsters and magic. Not a good contrast.The cinematography is hit or miss, the pacing is not bad, there are some excellent action set pieces and the monsters are awesome designs straight out of anime.Ultimately though, this movie though fun and worth seeing, will not go down as a very memorable achievement for anyone involved.",47 Ronin
166,jacobywarner,Seemingly Average,6,27 November 2019,"When I first watched this film I went in not really knowing about the story to come, but after seeing the poster of Keanu Reeves as a samurai with what seems to be a skeleton tattoo villain. Now I'm sure you can see why I was a little disappointed when I found that the skeleton man from the poster had very limited scree time but I digress.So this movie is a very entertaining flick that has a lot to offer; adventure, magic, and loads of Keanu Reeves. So as this story unravels there are themes of honor and pride, a fresh take on old samurai films with the same story telling finesse. However there was still something missing, so as a result this movie comes off as a little less than average.It's because of this that I chose to give this movie a 6/10.",47 Ronin
167,gojiseb,"A fun, imaginative and satisfying samurai fantasy with a wonderful cast.",8,7 January 2014,"It pains me to see this is flopping as hard as it is. We live in a world where Grown Ups 2 can be #1 at the box office, but this flops. I'm also rather surprised at the amount of flack it's getting from critics and audiences alike. I went with a couple friends and we all enjoyed the hell out of it.The story is old and simple, but some of the best ones are. Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is disgraced after being tricked by an evil Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) into attempting to kill Lord Kira (Tadanodu Asano). He commits seppuku, leaving his samurai as ronin. Years past and Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) tracks down a half-breed named Kai (Keanu Reeves), who was sold to the Dutch and forced into slavery aboard a ship where he is looked over by a Foreman (Rick Genest in a brief cameo). Oishi convinces Kai into joining him, his son (Jin Akinishi) and the remaining ronin into avenging their master's death.Like I said, a simple but good story. This film had a very troubled production and it shows, but I believe something good managed to come out of the mess. 47 Ronin manages to be a fun, thoughtful and imaginatively stylish fantasy adventure with enough heart and emotion in it to keep it from going stale.I highly recommend checking it out while you still can (I doubt it'll be in theaters much longer). It was a blast to see it on the big screen and one can only wish that it had done better at the box office.",47 Ronin
168,joelsmith190,"Great samurai film. Not too keen on the mythology, but still great",8,22 July 2015,"47 Ronin is a 2013 film based around the Japanese story of the 47 ronin. Ronin were masterless samurai, and were considered a huge problem back in the days of feudal Japan. That's as much as I knew, going into this movie.As with any other adaptation, I went into 47 Ronin with a blank mind and waited to judge it upon its own merits. One big thing is that the action (particularly the sword fights) are incredibly fast- paced, stylish, and well crafted. The special effects are mixed, some things look phenomenal; other things look like they came straight from a toilet. The musical score is amazing. The story is almost self explanatory.47 Ronin is a pretty awesome samurai film, and the US barely gets any of them. And because this niche has barely been tapped into, 47 Ronin feels like one of a kind. It's incredibly stylish and fast- paced, though some fight scenes are mildly confusing/over the place. Which is why the final rating of 47 Ronin is an 8/10. It's a great film, but it's not fantastic and it doesn't have as thick of an atmosphere as I thought it would have. The premise sounds intriguing, but in the end, this is a sword fight film through and through.",47 Ronin
169,ajping,A very well-acted and superbly shot fantastical take on a historical event,8,27 December 2013,"This movie is surprisingly well-conducted considering the grounding it needed in historical events and the original additions envisioned by the writers. Reeves shines in this performance as a sullen, reluctant warrior with short but emotionally laden lines that would have been over-delivered by another actor. Asano's performance as Lord Kira is another delightful surprise - he almost steals the show with his childish delight in villainy. Kikuchi and Shibasaki also do not disappoint. The pacing is very good and the director makes good use of camera distance (no pointless close-ups).The movie struggles in a few places, however. It would have been helped greatly from about five more minutes of shooting. Some of the early battle-scenes are poorly lit and hurried making it difficult to see what exactly happens. Some back-story on the evil champion is also warranted. And a little more fleshing out of some of the lesser ronin characters would have helped to make the scenes easier to follow as many of the ronin wear almost identical clothing and similar hair styles.But what is particularly amazing is that, after watching the movie, one is left with the feeling that this is a true story despite the fantastical elements. The emotion carries very well without a lot of dialog or lengthy speech-making. Very much worth watching! I intend to see it again.",47 Ronin
170,praveenkkr,Enjoyed every scene,9,4 April 2021,"It's a good fantasy movie with nice graphics. Story is good. But, Acting by Reeves is a big let down. He is attractive, no doubt.

May be, they should've named it differently so that people won't get offended.",47 Ronin
171,McCamyTaylor,"In 10 Years, This Will Be Considered a Classic",8,4 January 2014,"I write this with confidence. Back in the 1970's a big budget film ""flopped"". The critics panned it. The director was mocked for spending too much time and money on a movie about a subject that America was no longer interested in, the Vietnam War. The film? ""Apocalypse Now."" Where is ""Apocalypse Now"" now? In the list of all time classic films, where it belonged from the moment it was released. Where are the reviewers who panned it? Some of them are probably writing scathing reviews about ""47 Ronin"" at this very moment, because they just don't ""get"" ""47 Ronin"" the way that they did not ""get"" ""Apocalypse Now."" What Roland Barthes called ""Blind and dumb criticism""...""I do not understand (your art), therefore you are a fool."" If you want to get your money's worth, you are going to have to do a little homework before you see ""47 Ronin."" Nothing tough. Just go on line and read the back story. No, it will not be a spoiler. Every Japanese person knows the story. The film's producers assume that you know the story. Imagine going to see a movie about King Arthur if you know nothing about King Arthur. I can not even imagine what it would be like to see ""47 Ronin"" if you did not already know the story---however, I suspect that your reaction would be something like ""Huh? This didn't make any sense. I couldn't follow the story. I don't understand the characters' motivation. The ending was unexpected."" If you really want to ""get"" it, make sure that you have at least a basic understanding of Japanese history and culture, and (especially) Buddhism. Every oriental martial arts movie you will ever see is a Buddhist parable. If you do not know the meaning of the phrase ""attachment is the root of all suffering"" and if you do not understand that dualism is the ultimate evil, you are going to wind up confused.Now the spoilers. If you have read the back story, you know that Keanu Reeves' character is not the hero. The hero is Oishi, who must avenge his master. If you watch the movie thinking that Kai is the hero, you are going to be confused and disappointed. Second, if you forget that this is a Buddhist parable, then you are going to be mighty confused when Kai breaks his vow and uses tengu magic. In a western, dualistic film, breaking your solemn vow to yourself is a sign of weakness and usually merits a speedy death. If you are a Buddhist, embracing the darkness--the thing you fear the most---is a necessary step towards enlightenment. The 47 Ronin of the title embrace their ""ronin-ness""--the fact that they are outcast, outlaws and break the Shogun's law in order to do the right thing. Zen Buddhism is very important in Japan, because it allows people who have an almost obsessive compulsion to follow the law no matter how inappropriate it is a chance to step outside the box from time to time in order to do something that needs to be done. That is why the story of the 47 Ronin speaks to the people of Japan. These are men who did all the wrong things for the right reason---and their society rewarded them for it. Yes, suicide in this case is a reward. Remember that ""death"" at the end of an oriental film does not mean you lose. If you die without fear, then you achieved enlightenment in your life.I found the movie enjoyable on a visceral level, too. It made me cry, which few films do. The art was spectacular. The supernatural elements, especially the Tengu Forest were wonderful. My only complaint is I would have preferred to have the Japanese actors speak Japanese---I think requiring them to speak English handicapped them a bit.",47 Ronin

(Is it even possible to write a review containing spoilers for this movie?)",3,27 March 2014,"The beautiful Japanese story has been made a mockery by Hollywood taste, just like 300. This is a B-movie (of A-budget) that is a predictable LEGO-construction, built of second-hand Hollywood commonplaces. Keanu Reeves proves again he is a celeb rather than an actor (there's not a slightest change in his ""performance"", after he turned from slave into killing machine - the same face, the same behaviour... Sly would have done the same way...). Many of the reviewers asking for historical accuracy (I don't know what movie they were watching, from the 4th minute on you know that it is a mythical tale: mythical beasts, witches, magic), but I only ask for logic: if you can't tell from the robes that a woman is princess or concubine, you never lived in feudal Japan for a minute... If you'd say this to a feudal lord's daughter, that would be considered a serious insult, even high treason, and your head would roll in the sand in two seconds... Nobody watched this movie before release?

177,sepial,47 Movies. With Keanu.,3,21 March 2014,"I went to see this film mainly for 2 reasons. For once, the story of the 47 Ronin is one I sort of grew up with, and I strive to see any film adaptation made. And here I also wanted to know what on Earth Keanu Reeves had to do in it. The answer is that thanks to ultra-libertarian screen-writing and Mr Reeves' presence itself the viewer is to experience the privilege of watching a whole number of movies for the admission of one. I just wish it'd been movies we haven't already seen. To be clear from the start: I don't mind a U.S. production stamping out an English language version on the theme, and I'm more than fine with an all-Japanese cast supporting Keanu. The choice would be between keeping the tale in Japan or do a 'Magnificent Seven' with it; the decision was made for the former, so I want the actors to be Japanese. Neither do I have much of a problem with those actors then delivering their lines in English (this is way different from and much better than having Brits and Americans playing Russians with a by then unnecessary attempt of a Russian accent) – if a studio isn't brave enough to finance the project in the language of the place it's set in and present the audience with this – gee, god – challenge, that's again one of two choices, and I can either live with that or do the honourable thing. Of course, if the screenplay asks for Keanu Reeves to be the center of things, he'd have to learn some Japanese, but naturally that isn't the point. The problem is that despite all ambitions one could grant the project it is still a vehicle film. This becomes painfully clear every time the principal actor isn't involved in a scene, for then the film fares best. This isn't at all Keanu's fault. Our most beloved mime dug deep in his tool- kit and decided for the appropriate approach to his role: the Klaatu- way. Minimally accented facial expression, heavy stress on the mostly slow motions. Which is perfect for a part that is essentially a Jedi knight, trained by the best of superior mythical creatures and without whom the bunch (now we know it, they're just Samurai, and they needed an American played outsider to kick ass for them) would never make it, shown right at the outset. If you happened to watch the trailer and wonder where that huge monster they're hunting fits in, you'll keep at it when you're watching the whole; that one, witches turning dragons or breathing white widow spiders, and that order of mythical eagle-head creatures, all not only threaten our heroes but also the actual story from being buried under everything goes-wonderland. But anyways, that monster is brought down by Keanu single-handedly while a whole hunting gang fails. That's some serious Kso right there, and after that had really gone down we eventually find indispensable Keanu on a harbor island where he'd turned into Logan and show-fights even the most rednecked monster-sailor off the boards. You know where this is going. There's even a variation of Neo's 'This will end tonight.' Don't get me wrong. Once surrendering to this 47 movies in one it can be quite entertaining, by the time they enter that village to get swords made by the finest sword makers I was kinda hoping they'd find Hattori Hanzo. It just totally undermines the central story. More so than the clichés. Speaking of which, when will Hollywood learn to trust in some degree of nuance? While the castle of the gentle lord is bathed in sunlight and colours – Seppuku is always committed right on time for cherry- blossoming – the villain, with a sexually charged witch and an armoured version of Richard Kiel's Jaws as his side-kicks, rules over a mainly black clothed army within a monster- version of a castle set within the misty, dark, desolate mountains of what is undoubtedly Mordor – we get it, he's the bad guy. I'm trying to imagine the project funded for an all-Japanese crew, including the writer, for the same cast but without the obvious vehicle purpose that prompted Keanu Reeves and thus his character. The multi- movie sickness would have been averted. This way 46 Ronin might stir uncomfortably in their graves, and one is spinning. I give it 3 stars nonetheless, one for giving the ground to Japanese actors, one because it still looks very pretty, and one for giving much screen presence to Min Tanaka, Hiroyuki Sanada and, foremost, Rinko Kikuchi as the witch.",47 Ronin

Keanu reeves plays ""the one"" again, with his own set of powers which weren't really necessary in the film, seriously he used his powers like twice in the entire film. as a matter of fact the whole supernatural feel of the movie wasn't necessary at all considering that the story actually happened and there are many legends surrounding the story of the 47 ronin, specially if your making the movie in homage to the actual true story. the other unnecessary part was the whole white man to the rescue motif that keeps popping up in movies like this...the last samurai comes to mind, they could've just used an actual Japanese guy to play the role of ""kay""...but then i guess we wouldn't have the pleasure of Keanu Reeves. the only thing that really bothers me about the movie was Kay himself...his past is barely touched on and his powers and abilities were barely used, i kinda wished they would have touched on that some more and expanded on the character...it kinda makes the main character barely necessary. all in all a mediocre albeit fun/watchable film..good for a popcorn watch with friends.",47 Ronin
179,sr-shah,Keanau is the second best thing in this confused mess.,3,25 April 2021,"Hiroyuki Sanada's talent is utterly wasted on this Hollywood by commitee CG fantasy. The next most on-point performance is by Keanau, whose traditional Japanese mannerisms are far more authentic than the lightweight daytime drama level of his other Japanese co-stars who are completely out of their depth. Only Sanada resists the misguided direction and production design that can't decide if the film takes place in Japan or China. The film's shortcomings don't stop there. Continuity shattering editing, and kaleidescopic visuals that completely obscure, perhaps intentionally, the action make the film difficult to watch. Ultimately the boredom of the story damns the film to an unrecommendable level. Sleeping sitting up in a chair was far more appealing than discovering the ending of the story. The three stars are solely for Mr. Sanada and Keanau. They are the only thing worth seeing here.",47 Ronin

I'v read some on internet and there was really material to use. I think Keanu Reeves (Kai) did a fine job playing his role, as his fellow actor Hiroyuki Sanada (Oishi) and the rest of crew of course.I must add one thing that I didn't like, it was the language, I hate it when they speak English when it obviously should have been original Japanese, they americanized it to much.Overall I liked it, it was fun, enjoyable, it had drama, plot, story, all things that movie need. I must say I'm a huge fan of Keanu and always waiting for his new movies. Highly recommend this movie. Go and check it out for yourselves.",47 Ronin
181,reigntall,"Has lots of action among beautiful landscapes and costumes, but all very anti-climactic",6,20 December 2013,"It is a serviceable film in the whole eye-candy department and does give an interesting insight to the notions of honor of feudal Japan, but all-in-all a forgettable film. This movie is based on a true story, one of better known stories in Japan, of 47 ronin (masterless samurai) that sought revenge for the death of their master knowing they would die doing it. The story taps into the ideas loyalty and honor that prevailed in feudal Japan and among the samurai. As a very white man with some knowledge of Japanese history, the film seems like a fairly accurate depiction of feudal Japan. Though one thing that bothered me was that among the words like seppuku, shogun, bushido, etc. that are used in the film, the lords are just called lords rather than daimyos. It seemed strange to not use the more accurate word. But overall, a realistic depiction well, except for all the magic and mystical creatures. The movie is an interesting blend between reality and Japanese myth, featuring Tengu, witches, etc. The special effects are top notch.I was worried, since the film featured Keanu Reeves on the poster so heavily, that this would be another The Last Samurai situation where the white man comes to save the poor, lowly Japanese. I was pleasantly surprised that not to be the case. Though Keanu Reeves character Kai (who is a half-breed raised by demons. So not really all that white) is an integral part to the ronins' quest, he isn't really the main hero. The film focuses heavily on the head samurai, Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada). It is his quest to avenge his fallen master and reclaim honor for his land. The acting in the film was good overall. Some deliveries were a bit weird, but just might be due to the fact that all the Japanese actors spoke with a slight accent. I am a fan of Keanu Reeves; dude has been in a lot of great action movies. In this film, he doesn't do all that much, emotional range wise. He is pretty much serious, gloomy, morose, or angry throughout the whole film. I don't think he smiles once. Poor, sad Keanu.The main problem I have with the film is the pacing and the climax. There is so much action throughout the film and various setbacks that they suffer. When it is finally time for the climax and Oishi faces off the evil Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) it all feels sort of anticlimactic. The moment doesn't feel heightened from the rest of the film. The witch with heterochromia (Rinko Kikuchi) is an interesting character. She is chaotic and seeks power. You feel that even though she pledged herself to Lord Kira, she might have something up her sleeve. But nope, she was just his lackey by the end – very disappointing. Well the end-end is a good and not your cliché Hollywood ending, which is nice.tl;dr nice visuals, decent action, decent story, but anti-climactic. 6 out of 10 beheadings",47 Ronin
182,jandmga,A beautifully made movie,10,30 May 2016,"Where to begin. I have watched this movie several times and decided to write this review because of the vast amount of negative reviews. First of all the costumes, the scenery, the visual effects and the acting was superb. Even the musical score was haunting. The story is one of old Japan. Old Japen was full of cultural ways that they ruled the country. There were definite divisions in the ruling classes and strong ideas on how you were to act in every situation. Certain customs you were to observe to save face, etc.. So the story of 47 Ronin is old feudal Japan. Samurai protected their Lord's kingdom. There was always infighting amongst the different feudal kingdoms of Japan. So when this story opens, there is treachery afoot. When the Samaurai's Lord is tricked into attracting another Lord, he is ordered by the Shogun, the ruling emperor to commit suicide. So the Samaurai become Ronin as they have no Lord now. But they seek revenge against the Shogun's order for the treachery of their Lord. The Samaurai enlist the aid of Kai, who has lived among them as an outcast since arriving in their Land. He was raised as a boy by mystical beings in the Tangu Forest. He helps them in their quest. There is beautiful love story entwined in the revenge story between Kai and the daughter of the Samauri's Lord. Overall, a beautifully told story. Keanu Reeves, as always does a superb job as the outcast. The film allows the Japanese actors to carry the movie, and they do a superb job as well. This movie is as well done as The Last Samurai. This movie does not deserve all of the negative reviews it has received. Maybe it is because most people do not understand Japanese cultural or they were expecting an Avengers type of movie. Forego all the reviews and watch this movie with an open mind and just sit back and enjoy. After all it is an entertaining movie. And oh by the way, go Keanu Reeves for another acting job well done. He is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Just check out some of his movies and you will see what I mean other then the Matrix Trilogy, which he was great in. So go out and enjoy.",47 Ronin
183,findingdevotion,So close ...,5,12 January 2014,"""So close..."" is the best I can say about this movie. It came so close of being great and it had everything going for it, starting from a great premise and ending with a decent cast and beautiful visuals.Although its premise is a known fragment of Japanese history, I did not enter the cinema hall expecting historical accuracy. Saying that ""47 Ronin"" isn't historically accurate is like saying ""300"" isn't historically accurate ... or that mythology flicks don't follow the written material. They weren't meant to from the beginning.Personally I found that the mix of magic with the storyline had great potential and the movie had a lot going for it: - (for the most part) great cast. The SHogun, Asano's daughter, his samurai, their parts are well written and even better acted - the visuals are compelling, beautiful even - the cultural items are correct (for the first time a near-perfect depiction of seppuku), costumes, decorations, etc - fights are well choreographed - amazing soundtrack that follows the beat of the movie - finally a movie that's not about saving the world as whole, just plain old vengeanceOn the other hand, the downsides are almost equal in number and intensity: - Keanu is not an asset. He's not as horrible as other times, but doesn't fit at all in the movie - the skeleton tattooed gunman that appears on the poster is nowhere to be found. He appears for about 2 seconds in the movie and has a line, very very disappointing for someone who appears to be a main feature on the poster - the Witch part is horribly written and incredibly poorly acted. So poorly that it even makes Keanu seem good. - the movie is uneven paced. Starts slowly, the cuts off for a while and then accelerates all through to the endAlso, a few annoying things: - for all the visual accuracy of seppuku, I'm not sure why the writers decided to make the act a punishment. Seppuku was a personal decision following an act of dishonor, very rarely the result of an order. While in Asano's case it made sense, in the case of the ronin themselves there was no reason for the shogun to give them any order (much less to bear witness to their act, especially since they were ronin, the shogun had no power over them) they were to take their own lives anyway - the shogun states that following Asano's death they were to become ronin, but then again the samurai belonged to house/clan, not to a person. In the actual story, the family was stripped of titles and technically dissolved as a clan, therefore it could have no samurai on retainer. In the movie's logic, Oishi should have continued to serve the daughter. - the shogun rules the land but had no authority over tradition, gestures as those mentioned above as well as the order to dissolve a province by joining it with a rival would have resulted in immediate war. The shogun did rule the country, but the balance was kept by the province independence under the tutelageOverall, the movie is worth seeing once. If you're a Japan history aficionado, you will have to put a lot of effort into suspending any form of critical thinking but in the end, even so, those little details where the movie contradicts itself will come back to annoy you.",47 Ronin
184,JuiceZee,On my movie experience of 47 Ronin,10,25 December 2013,"I cannot imagine a better movie to acquaint westerners with this Japanese story that is so key to their culture. I have seen an earlier Japanese version and I failed to connect with its outdated cinematic techniques. With 47 Ronin I really got the feel of bushido and the way of the warrior samurai. These intentions are universal but the 1700'sare not within popular western cultural interests, usually, so bringing in a well known actor (Keanu Reeves) brought focus and believability to the scenes of battle and impossible love. No one pulls off demon fighting and magical elements like Reeves. And no one is better at being repressed, abused, and stigmatized and still coming round to everyone's aid like Reeves does.He is a hero within an ensemble group of heroes. I enjoyed getting more familiar with the Japanese actors. The female characters were not weaklings. Universal themes of cowardice and deception for personal gain were clear. I felt the movie was very well done from start to finish. I believe they accomplished what they set out to do. Exciting battle scenes and quiet dramatic scenes were well balanced throughout the movie. Exquisite cinematography throughout. Costumes looked authentic to me. Hair and makeup not overdone to make it all the more believable. I loved the minimalist dialogue and some of it has a familiar ring to it. The fantasy elements were second to none. The 3D was an added dimension but I feel this movie will be equally as good in 2D. You cannot see a more culturally enlightening story with more fantasy elements woven within it. I can fully recommend this movie and look forward to having the DVD in the future.",47 Ronin

Take one of the most (maybe THE most) famous and respected story in Japan culture, add some Keano (to reduce the expectations), add some scenery stolen from the Lord of the rings (to what about the expectations?), add some Hollywood mentality (to even more reduce the expectations), force some decent Japanese actors (one, Hiroyuki Sanada, or two were good indeed) to speak English for those Americans unable to read subtitles (to push the expectations almost to the bottom), and finally crown it all with poor directing (to kill it dead)...For the memory of Hiroshi Inagaki, Kenji Mizoguchi, Kunio Watanabe, I suggest this movie to be banned as poor taste.",47 Ronin

Feels uncomfortably and horribly misguided, something went terribly wrong.",2,13 May 2014,"The graphic artists did a good job but when you have to start your story by saying it's authentic - especially considering it's all in English and mostly not filmed in Japan - well some will remember mega-bass(tm), and that seems well geared for the beats wearing young viewers audience. A simple story of revenge and honour wasn't enough op. In the original story this guy committed an offence while the shogun visited but the way he was ordered to commit suicide by lesser officials wasn't appropriate and it was undignified. There is an overwhelming desire to set the record straight for posterity. Tension builds with time and anger, despair. There is a show of restraint and solidarity, all the ronin rooting for the common cause - setting their master's and their clan's honour straight - and having their life come to a meaningful conclusion once this is accomplished, by murdering expediently and violently those who didn't act in good faith. It is a very human and simple Japanese feudal story; a story of every day life. In the modern movie you can really feel that sub par and shameful exploitation of a moment in Japan's feudal history, a bit like with The Last Samurai, where Sanada also played with Cruise. It is also quite surreal for a full Japanese cast to be acting in English. One should watch the 1941 version to cleanse himself/herself of this 200+ million $ haunting madness.",47 Ronin

Its not the first time that Hollywood touched some unique stories. Example The Forbidden Kingdom (2008) is one of those movies.. but The Forbidden Kingdom was good movie. And what about 47 Ronin. Hollywood took too much liberties and made with not imagination. They took everything from the story. They just made serious ""play"" and for action film there are not much action.The actors did good job but even they can't save the movie. Shame..

Bad role, badly acted in a bad film, with talented Japanese actors forced to recite awful cliched lines in English.Had the dialogue been exclusively in Japanese, with no ""Braveheart"" type speeches (which simply don't work in a Japanese film), then this might have been better than a 2-star deal. Watching the Asian actors struggle with delivering English lines so badly that it breaks their characterizations was gut-wrenching. The witch, played by Rinko Kikuchi (Pacific Rim) was so NOT threatening or scary and delivered her lines slowly and without conviction, almost like she had a speech impediment.2 stars for good fight sequences, but nothing else of value here. I bet the producers thought that would be enough.Oh and if there's a sequel, please beware - all 47 Ronin commit seppuku at the end of the film, so if a sequel is written it's only to try to cash in our your gullibility.",47 Ronin

It is something that critics don't understand because they have already sold their souls. It is refreshing to see a movie like this they are rare. This movie dealt with Duty and men who would do their duty no matter the cost to themselves. Some things are worth dying for.

There was no impressive landscapes, there was no these magical scenes and magical battles (the trailer is quite misleading). Not counting the small dragon, exhausted resistance of evil. Keanu Reeves played well, but very inconspicuous. Action progressed very slowly. It was not clear who was the hero in this story - Keanu or chief samurai. Keanu what was it? Lover without a lover? Who finally killed himself without even a samurai and not even really a part of this society. By the way the weakest part of the film is the bad end.

Keanu Reeves is the only white dude in medieval Japan, (yeah, right) and then he meets and hangs out with a bunch of samurai until they accept him as one of their own. Oh yeah, and he wants to score with a Japanese chick the entire movie and these 47 Ronin want to help him score with this Japanese chick because her new husband killed their master and the samurai want to free her and kill her husband, which works out for Keanu Reeves. So Stupid.RIght after their master gets killed, the second in command samurai gets thrown in a pit for an undetermined amount of time, possibly months, and the first thing he does when he gets out is free Keanu Reeves from his UFC style existence aboard a Pirate ship. (yeah, right) After freeing him, the samurai states I don't know who or what you are, but help me. If that's true, why did he free Keanu Reeves? He then leads Keanu Reeves a short distance away where the other 45 Ronin are waiting. What? if they're right there, why raid the pirate ship alone? None of the rest of the movie will make any more sense, it's so stupid. It's like a fat greasy kid daydreaming about fighting monsters with samurai. Soooooo Dumb!",47 Ronin
197,Foal24,Sad Keanu is sad.,6,3 June 2014,"Preface: I blame 'Iron Man'. Ever since 2008 we expect our action movies to have clever writing, believable (to an extent) story lines, and quality performances. We've been spoiled. But I'm a child of the 80's. I remember a time when we were happy with 'Conan the Barbarian'. It was a simpler time for action/fantasy No one likes Keanu Reeves. At least in '47 Ronin'. This makes him sad. And brooding. And confused. Poor Keanu. I'm not even sure of the name of his character in this. He is just the much despised 'half-breed'.Set in 18th century feudal Japan (albeit in a fictional, fantastical version of itself where demons, witches and monsters roam), 47 Ronin is actually based on true events. I confess, in my ignorance, I was unaware of this fact going into it. I just assumed it was another run of the mill, special effect driven, fantasy, action flick. If that's all you're looking for, the film is not bad. Sure it has its' faults, but it works. And it is visually spectacular. Think '300'. Indeed, there are a number of similarities between the two. '300' took a classic story of Ancient Greece and drowned it with spectacular action pieces and CGI (and more six-packs than a 17 year olds birthday party), and dispensed with historical accuracy. '47 Ronin' is a far from accurate retelling of the story of the group of samurai who are left leaderless (thus becoming ronin) after their lord is ordered to commit ritual suicide (seppuku) for assaulting a rival visiting leader. The Ronin then plan to avenge the unjust death of their lord, and thus avenge his (and their own) honour. So, how does Keanu's half demon, half human (and only Caucasian actor present) fit into all this? He doesn't. Apart from being involved in some lovely fight scenes and a romantic side story, he has no real point. It's seems as though his character was a late addition, maybe to make the movie more appealing to Western audiences, who knows?? Look, it's not a great problem. As I said, if you're after an attractive looking action movie, the inclusion of Reeves' sad, often abused, and generally despised outcast of a character is of little consequence. If you're after a meaningful, well constructed story, well you'll be bothered by a lot more than just him.I chose to just accept he was there. His performance is fine. He is typical Keanu. There are a number of familiar Japanese faces that do a decent job too. Sensai ""Whatshisname"" (the one that gave Tom Cruise a terrible hiding in the rain in 'The Last Samurai') gives a solid performance as the leader of the Ronin. In fact his story carries plenty of emotional weight. The pain and sacrifice that his family experiences as part of the quest for honour is quite touching. And his portrayal is very good.I could not take the token mysterious witch lady seriously, because she first appears in the form of a white fox with one blue eye and one brown. The sinister expression on the fox's face just reminds me of the episode of 'The Simpsons' where Homer convinces Mel Gibson to let him make a movie and he insists that a 'suspicious looking dog' be the bad guy.Anyway, if it's Friday or Saturday night, you have nothing else to watch, and as a general rule you don't mind shallow, but attractive block busters, give this a go.47 Ronin – 6.5/10 Reviewed by Matthew French. https://www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews",47 Ronin
198,nkasherov,Terribly disappointing,6,16 January 2014,"I knew this movie was bad from reviews, but I went to see it anyways because I like Reeves and hoped for some good entertainment. Well, the movie happened to be really... bad.First of all, movie starts stupidly with a narrative of Reeves raised as a child from tengo-demons yet a minute later you are told he is so... gentle. In a few minutes they tell you the daughter of the clan leader and he are deep in love and this is character development the movie is based on. I do not mind if they put a white guy as the lead and tainting the real legend with some love story if executed well. But because of dull, stupid, clichéd dialog and bad acting the movie is predictable, mechanic, unconvincing and damn straight stupid. It is an insult to the original story of the 47 ronin. It is a movie telling to you ""I am a legendary movie because I am telling you so"". They added fantasy fairy tale twist to the original story. This could work if the ronins were trying to reach the enemy castle fighting waves of enemies and assassins, falling in traps, having heroic deaths ...but actually ALL the fights in the movie besides the final battle are short, dull and irrelevant to story line. In fact the trailer contains all the good moments. And no, there is no cool tattooed guy to fight with. There is no real demon monk fight as shown in the trailer. By the way, Buddhist tengu demons training killers to protect their ""beliefs""? I mean, really? Next - the BIG guy in the movie everyone expected to serve as a minor boss and have a great eye candy duel with, gone in a second blown by a bomb. The enemy clan leader - running and fighting like a pussy in the end. The final boss fight happened with the dragon-witch...and our hero used his magical power cheat-cheesy move to kill the dragon, the same magical power he has from the start of the story but never used before? All those fights from the trailer are so short and unimportant you just know they put it there as fillers. Probably for this reason you see no more than ten ronins in most scenes. One of the guys specifically says they are 47 because you would never believe they are more than 15 till the final scene. Where nobody is seen to use the magical swords they were given by the demons in any special way.200 ml dollars spent on this movie? Hollywood product placement idiocy. They should rather have made this movie a psychological drama with an epic real played battle in the end rather than waste cash on computer animations.",47 Ronin
199,swf64,Now for something completely different ...from fantasy!,8,11 May 2014,"This is a fantasy movie set in early Japan instead of a medieval setting. It reminded me of Snow White and the Huntsman. At its core it's about honor and forbidden love. This movie requires much disbelief, not the least of which is believing that Keanu Reeve would be there, but if you can make that leap it has much to offer. The movie has many magical moments and beautiful settings, and the vision of early Japan, with a fantasy spin, is wonderful.The thing I was most impressed by was the way the movie incorporated many styles seamlessly. The movie went from fantasy, to Indian Jones, to pirates of the Caribbean, with a natural even flow, and I really enjoyed that. The only flaw was one of the villains that seemed one dimensional and stock, but the stories villains as a whole had depth, and were major part of the stories ending and power. This movie was unlike any I've seen in a while. It's an idea that deviates from the norm, and this explains some of the reviews. This movie far exceeded my expectations.",47 Ronin
200,buggy3001,Reviewing this because its better than its rating,8,12 May 2014,"Compared to 70% of the garbage in theaters, this movie is both quite deep and fun to watch.It is not a huge budget movie, it doesn't have a perfect script or story overall, but the acting was great and the overall fantasy feel to it mixed in with samurai lore was really enjoyable.I expected this movie to be less than average due to overall scores. Don't pay attention to them. I'll be purchasing the bluray after seeing it just now.It has a slower beginning but it helps give characters depth. The ending is also quite spectacular because you're involved with the ronin every step of the way. The last 1/3rd of the film is as usual where the major battles happen, but act two does not disappoint.In my books this is a 7.5/10, gave it an 8 as its under rated on here. Approach it as a really good B movie and you'll love it. If you expect an Oscar nominations and a $200 mil budget for this, you should probably not be reviewing these sorts of films.",47 Ronin

It's an action/fantasy (with an emphasis on fantasy) flick, not historical or biography. I thought the storyline was good, action sequences wasn't over done and there's rarely any scenes where too much is happening at one time that would lose the audience. I would have loved to see more of a back-story from Kai's upbringing (perhaps on the extended DVD/bluray release?) but I have no real complaints. Acting was good and so were special effects, just a personal perspective but it would have also been cool if portions of the script were spoken in Japanese.

203,ovidnine,Not even Fun Bad,3,31 May 2014,"I'm not quite sure why I didn't give this movie even lower a rating. Possibly because you might think I'm hating on it for no reason, but seriously, I'm not, its that bad. When I saw the previews to this movie I immediately though ""Oh, its 300, just set in Japan, with Keanu Reeves."" due to some giant samurai in shiny armor and some weird looking guy Reeves is battling. But, while 300 is action packed, this movie is not. It'd be one thing if the story was decent and could carry you through to when the action happens, but it doesn't.This movie isn't even fun-bad where you shut your brain off and just enjoy the silly because its not silly. Its boring punctuated by brief moments of action. And not that interesting of action either.Imagine Michael Bay directed a movie with an effects budget of 1 million dollars. Then imagine he gave up after a week and left his grad student aide to finish the movie with a script written by a junkie male escort. That's kinda what this movie is.It takes a classic story, ""Woman loves man she can't have. Honor gets in the way. Betrayal happens. Honor must be restored through violence."" and makes it unbelievably boring.Seriously, its trying so hard to be ""Seven Samurai*"" but with awful direction, bad acting and a terrible script.So, maybe the action saves the movie. No, it doesn't. The movie drags on and on and relatively little action for how many swords are shown. Apparently at the end there is a bunch of fighting but I'd fallen asleep by that point because the movie was so badly done.Well, at least the effects are OK? Nope, they look worse than 1999's the Matrix. Seriously, if you're going to have two really important scenes feature a CGI character, don't make it look like you lifted it from Morrowind. This movie had a ton of potential to be a fun revenge action movie. Instead its ruined by a plodding plot, awful direction, and again Keanu Reeves is the BEST actor. Wooden does not begin to describe it. Terrible.*I don't mean its attempting to be 7 Samurai in its plot, but it is attempting to emulate classic samurai films and failing terribly.",47 Ronin

To my surprise it was better than expected. Well... it probably won't win any Oscars, but it is surely a good way to spend your Sunday afternoon.I liked that it is a film about Japan and samurai but they did not want to be extremely authentic. First of all they all speak English. With an accent of course :) Then, the scriptwriters concentrated on only a few samurai or Japanese traditions. These moments were the key points of the movie both as story, music, and visual effects.

Keanu Reeves sells us a convincing samurai -or should I say a half breed who became a samurai. You would expect the movie to dwell into the traditional route that fantasy movies take- some nobody becomes somebody and saves the world and becomes everyone's hero and the symbol of hope... But what I was surprised to see was that Keanu Reeves never becomes a tad greater than his warrior buddies, he becomes one of them. This simplicity of character is something that keeps you a little invested in his character but you would certainly agree that this is not his best. Supposed to be a tale of bravery and loyalty but I saw very little of both. Instead I was pushed into more and more fantasy elements that were not really very good to the story's continuity. The CGI was excellent and the Japan in the movie look really impressive. Yes, visuals really put this movie to good start but I felt that it started to lose momentum with its underwhelming character development and dull script. I didn't quite feel invested in the characters, personally I was never scared that any of them might die. There are some really good scenes in this movie but there are bad ones too. A lot of them. Other than that I felt it was acceptable. Conclusion :But despite all of it's shortcomings its not a bad movie or is it the best one.

I felt pleasantly surprised, therefore, to discover that 47 Ronin actually used martial arts only as a means of furthering the excellent story, which deals well with such concepts as deceit, honor, sacrifice, justice, and doomed but eternal love. (WARNING: THE FIRST CLAUSE OF THE NEXT SENTENCE PROVIDES VAGUE SPOILERS.) Based on a true story about ronin (masterless samurai) who took revenge for the unjust death of their daimyo (lord) in early eighteenth-century Japan, 47 Ronin adds a touch of magic and a new character, the love interest played ably by Keanu Reeves, to round out the film for today's audiences. The mostly Japanese cast gave a stellar, nuanced performance, and the Hungarian locations provided a breathtaking, dramatic backdrop.

Of course, the dialog and acting were bad, but that has not stopped me from enjoying other mindless flicks. So I need to find the reason this movie only rated 4/10 for me. Well, how about the completely unnecessary graft of The 300 into a completely meaningless fight scene on the Dutch ship? Speaking of which, how about the complete waste of a make up job for the dude hanging out on the Dutch ship? How about the complete botch of costumes? The complete botch of how to bow? No, these all add to annoyances only. Ah, I have it. Samurai films are about honor, its loss and its futile chase, only to die at the end. This film has no honor. No character displays it.

Pivoting around the historical inaccuracies and the addition of the ""Half Breed"" character played by Keanu Reeves to this legendary tail. More on that further in.In a nut shell. 47 Ronin has a fair amount of mystical magic and demons peppered throughout a historical tail. A tale of Samurai who's master is killed and their status is reduced to Ronin. Only for them to rise up and seek revenge against the evil ruler and his witch who are responsible.Let's get to some positive stuff. Visually the 47 Ronin is beautiful. The costumes design and color choices to separate each of the different clans is impressive in it's complexity. The villains are not just dressed in black, but a fair amount of purple and silver is mixed in to highlight the details in their armor. The sets have an epic feel that is grounded and doesn't feel to fantastic, but rather believable.Now on to the ""Half Breed"", who mainly adds the taste of a forbidden love story as well as a lifeline to the audience, drowning is a sea of unfamiliar faces. Many, if not most reviewers who've pan this movie for the addition of the ""half breed"" character fail to realize his importance for the audience. Around the start of the third act, there's a scene where one of the samurai apologies for his treatment of the half breed in a way that communicates to the viewer exactly where a Ronin places in the Japanese cultural/social structure vs where a Samurai does. The inclusion of this character and his treatment throughout the movie is an important plot device. Seeing his treatment by the Samurai as an outcast in the first act, then later his acceptance once they are labeled as Ronin is vital to the evolution of the main Japaneses characters of the story. Not to mention it helps to bridge a gap for an audience unfamiliar with Japanese cultural and social structure.Historical inaccuracy are common in Hollywood. I personally view the ones in 47 Ronin to be no more reprehensible then the ones committed in superheroes films. Yes, I am comparing changes made to characters from Batman, X-Men, Spiderman and Iron Man's cannon to this historical tale of the 47 Ronin. Deal with it, they're just stories after all. We really have no way to know it there really wasn't a half breed character, do we? After all, history is told by the winners, and often inaccurately.With a 2 hour run time, it did feel a bit slow to start, setting the stage for the second and third act. Once it gets going tho, it moved rather nicely. I didn't find myself checking my watch every 10 minutes wondering when it would end like another holiday release I won't mention. If the trailer interests you then you could probably do worst at the box office this holiday season. I enjoyed it, but that's just my opinion.",47 Ronin

The movie was excellent. We had been dying to see it since the first announcements, and despite the critics reviews, we went. Thank goodness we did.The special effects were good, the story was good. Keanu Reeves did not come off as Bwana, the white savior of the poor little Japanese people, as some people might think, as per the usual American movies. He did stand out, but it was well shared with the Japanese actors. The story itself is not American, and I believe that may have thrown off critics. The ending is unusual, though I will not spoil it for you.I recommend this movie highly. Should you have the itch as we did, see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.",47 Ronin

This ""movie"" is a textbook example of how not to shoot films. Horrible on every conceivable level. Horrible is too weak of a word. It's WAY beyond horrible, a new word is needed. The acting is ridiculously bad, which is of course to be expected from Mr. Stoneface Mumble Reeves. (His previous abomination, ""Man of Tai Chi"", has to be seen to be believed). The bad guy was even worse, as impossible as it sounds. The love interest and the bad witch - almost at the same level. Masterfully bad. It takes serious dedication to get THAT bad, I **** you not. The dialogue was the dumbest, flattest, emptiest random bunch of words ever. It works as a comedy, though, but somehow I vaguely suspect that this wasn't intentional. The director should be banned from making films ever again. Dude, just... don't, please. The people who wrote the ""screenplay"" should be sent to work the land somewhere in Texas and never be let near a computer again. Or a pen. Or a sandpit and a stick. Horrible editing, too. Surprisingly enough, the DP was probably the only guy on set who knew what was he doing. A couple of mildly interesting shots shine like pearls in dung. The worst thing is the complete lack of respect for Japanese culture and tradition. Sincere and heartfelt condolences to any Japanese person reading this. You know how Americans usually portray non-Americans? Well, it's way worse than that this time. Pretty much the only entertaining moments were when, out of mind-numbing boredom, I started making farting sounds in the middle of the tons of meaningful-intense-long-gaze situations. After that I slept for 20 minutes, missing (according to my gf) the final fight scene and waking up just in time for the grand finale. And I NEVER sleep during a movie, out of respect for the people who put so much effort in it. Couldn't care less this time, I just wish I could get these 2 hours of my life back somehow. GOD, what a ****ty movie. Can't believe they spent so much money on a pile of utter and complete crap. Who greenlighted this?! Were they smoking crack or just stupid ?! Go see it. Really. Motion pictures this horrible are a delightful rarity to be savoured, if you are into that kinda thing. I just know that my all-time TOP 5 WORST list has a new entry. Hell, it kicked down the door and burned the house down. Now, having fulfilled my civil duty I will just erase this thing from my memory.",47 Ronin
217,amdarmy,A very divisive epic,9,24 September 2014,"This film is a very loose translation of ancient Japanese mythology, that pretends to be an accurate retelling, and goes a bit overboard when trying to make certain sections accessible to American audiences. It also borrows heavily from other films in its basic plot.That said, it's a visually stunning film with strong character development, emotional impact, and sparse but well executed combat. The final confrontation is especially well done.And for all the cliché it boasts, it features an ending that is rooted heavily in context to the point that it's jarring and upsetting, but unquestionably valid and appropriate. For me, that makes up for a lot. It's unique in a way that plays heavily against the stereotype that plagues so many Hollywood tales.In the end, you're going to love it, or you're going to hate it. There's not much room for middle ground. If you forgive it its flaws, it's hard to deny it's wealth of well executed elements.

Having their heads severed was so uncalled for. Moreover, the ""Brave Heart"" move pulled of was nothing but a concoction of a bland and trite plot. Keanu could have done better.

For the quality of effects it is quite good, when it comes down to it's actors it's a mixup of trying to get Japanese culture out to the international audience without screwing up to much. Some may downgrade it because of that simple fact. But it's to erly to start trashtalking cultural improovements. It's an all good afternoon worthy movie. If you like swords and mystical culture.

It was a good incorporation of mythology and the story (story line), visually beautiful and great acting. I really enjoyed the fighting scenes, it had a nice flow to it, rather than other movies that film the action scenes so fast that is gets hards to visually keep up with whats happening. It seems like a lot of thought went into to filming this and its not a rushed job, which is what great movies should be about. I cannot think of another actor that could have been better for this role than Keanu Reeves, either the role was written with him in mind or he was meant to play this role. I don't think he gets enough credit as an actor, he was 100% on point in this role, the physical, the emotional, the respect and truly understanding his character. One of the best movies ever made.",47 Ronin

They had room to go way further and it would have been a real success. Flat characters with no dimension.

The action scenes are mildly entertaining and certainly have good effects, but I was unable to give any care for any character. Development is non existent, and motivations are poorly written if present at all.But the largest problem is that this movie isn't about what was in the trailer at all. If this was actually an interesting fantasy movie with infinite warriors and all that jazz, it may have been entertaining despite its faults. However, the second largest character on the movie poster is in the movie for a total of 3 actual seconds. Less than one scene.

Ronin does get off to a slow start but gains speed as it reaches the final scene of where our samurai seek their revenge. The editor did a wonderful job of trying to fight sequences together where one is not sure where they are till the camera pulls back.

That's fine. I didn't mind the witch, the dragons etc one bit. In fact I applaud the CG was quite nicely done.On the other hand I think the 'adaptation' REALLY falls short of the mark when it misses on the most critical elements of the story. For example, the LOYALTY of the 47 to their lord. The SACRIFICE they were willing to make. The movie completely ignores most of the 47, and really focused on 2 leads out of the 47, instead of the whole group and the dynamics of all of them.So, in the end I think it is still an entertaining movie if you are into this fantasy / Japanese samuria genre, just that it could have delivered so much more.",47 Ronin

The film is very American, but delves into some Japanese details along the way. 47 Ronin does a great job of including a few mythological aspects that don't overbear the viewing experience. While I hate the restraints on the artists due to movie ratings, this film is perfectly suitable for young viewers, hopefully opening their eyes to different methods of storytelling. This in turn will create a demand for American movies to diversify in their storytelling instead of shelling out the same plot scenarios they are accustomed too. I highly recommend this movie simply to take in the amazing scenery the artist were able to produce. Truly amazing and another I wish I would have seen in my local theater.",47 Ronin
228,dvigilante1,"Keanu's love story and his struggles, no Ronin",2,16 January 2014,"I was surprised how awful this film is. To the point. The first hour there are two fights, all involving Keanu, all with no blood, all against mystique creatures. The dialogue in this film is surprisingly bad. Not just Keanu but the rest of the cast. It would've been better to have everyone speak the language at the time (with Eng subs) maybe have Keanu speak mostly English since he was an outsider. There was no tension whatsoever. The dramatic scenes felt forced. Also, for a film to be so long the first and second acts feel scattered with absolutely no development of the characters. You don't get to know any other Ronin except the guy who dislikes Keanu and the fat Ronin who coincidentally dies in the next scene after he is introduced to the audience.The film is shot well with beautiful colors but I don't know they tried to make it so epic. If you going to make an epic adventure about a group of people going to battle we at least have some sense of who the group is. We know the seven dwarfs. We know all the Hobbits. In 47 Ronin, the only person we know is Keanu and he isn't even a Ronin.The love story. Of course it is never explained why the princess is madly in love with Keanu. But what makes it odd is there isn't any competition for her love. Usually in those formulaic films you have the female torn between choosing one guy over another (ie Twilight). I kept thinking what does this love story have to do with 47 Ronin. Overall this film is a bunch of random shots thrown together with cliché dialogue, no blood and some unexplained romance.",47 Ronin

The phrase ""honor in death"" comes from the honor you gain in dying for a cause, in fighting for one. NOT from just aimlessly killing yourself because someone says to. What an absolutely stupid theory. This movie shows ZERO courage and these fighters were weak minded to let another human tell them they needed to kill themselves because of some stupid ideology that they are being punished for the crime of dishonor.

Duty and justice before the fear of death is what the 47 Ronin did, and their actions will forever be remembered and is know to be one of the biggest acts of Honor in the Japanese culture. Every year in December, the 47 Ronin are paid their respects by people from all around the world.Directed by Carl Rinsch as his Directorial debut demonstrates his great talent in the film making industry. Starring, Keanu Reeves and many other great Japanese actors, this movie centers around Honor and the samurai. The story plays out beautifully giving you all the information and emotion that allows you to create a connection with the characters. This movie draws you in causing feelings that you did not expect a movie could do, I loved seeing the strength of Honor in the Japanese culture that this movie illustrates. I was drawn into this movie from the first few minutes and I did not look away.Do this movie justice and watch it on a big screen! Keanu Reeves did a fine performance as well if you were wondering if he would bring this movie down or not. He brought a great performance making me hope he continues to stay in the spotlight of movies. I also really enjoyed his Man of Tai Chi movie.

231,rocky-m,Potential squandered,6,7 January 2014,"I really wanted to like this film. The trailer looked great and the premise is fantastic. The actors are top-notch (yes, even Keanu, I consider him good actor on occasion). The budget looked rather hefty.But all that was wasted on single-dimensional characters, predictable scenario, potential that was never fulfilled. The film LOOKS great, I admit it. But the story is not particularly smart nor deep.And the IMDb says I have to keep writing, so I do. OK, I really liked how the Japanese actors handled English, though I would like to see Japanese version of the film, I am pretty sure it exits. Maybe Japanese language would give it some additional quality. Keanu was good for what was his character - there was simply not enough room for him to develop, nor for any other character. The biggest fails of this film are definitely the story and the scenario. Acting was OK - given the scenario, cinematography and scenography were pretty good, the FX were good... But the movie simple is not interesting enough.I would still watch it, but on the cable TV, not in the cinema.This is really 7/10, but for the lost potential I give it 6/10.",47 Ronin
232,timeisnotlinear-362-833927,Wonderful tale from feudal Japan.,10,24 December 2013,"I cannot imagine a better movie to acquaint westerners with this Japanese story that is so key to their culture. I have seen an earlier Japanese version and I failed to connect with its outdated cinematic techniques. With 47 Ronin I really got the feel of bushido and the way of the warrior samurai. These intentions are universal but the 1700'sare not within popular western cultural interests, usually, so bringing in a well known actor (Keanu Reeves) brought focus and believability to the scenes of battle and impossible love. No one pulls off demon fighting and magical elements like Reeves. And no one is better at being repressed, abused, and stigmatized and still coming round to everyone's aid like Reeves does.He is a hero within an ensemble group of heroes. I enjoyed getting more familiar with the Japanese actors. The female characters were not weaklings. Universal themes of cowardice and deception for personal gain were clear. I felt the movie was very well done from start to finish. I believe they accomplished what they set out to do. Exciting battle scenes and quiet dramatic scenes were well balanced throughout the movie. Exquisite cinematography throughout. Costumes looked authentic to me. Hair and makeup not overdone to make it all the more believable. I loved the minimalist dialogue and some of it has a familiar ring to it. The fantasy elements were second to none. The 3D was an added dimension but I feel this movie will be equally as good in 2D. You cannot see a more culturally enlightening story with more fantasy elements woven within it.

If it starred the cast of Duck Dynasty, I'd expect better acting. But it wasn't and that's what makes this movie such a tragedy.The only redeeming thing about this movie was the costuming and set designs, and even they seemed to be packed with everything they could jam in them from the prop department.Inane, clichéd, dull, I could go on.

For authenticity: the 47 Ronin story is well done; the cast is mostly really Japanese (lending a nice feel using a cast with Japanese culture); and Reeves does a nice job as Kai. A few, subtle western touches enhance the ability of the audience to relate to the story. For effects: very nice integration of 3D and CG without overdoing. Critics who panned this really missed the boat. I will probably add this as a DVD to my very sparse 'keeper' library. If you are into superficial, it's not your movie.

In between sequences I often asked myself if I was enjoying the movie - and I'm still not sure. It was so... odd.It seems to me that newbie director Carl Rinsch was slightly out of his depth on this project. Perhaps the task of condensing the massive Japanese legend into a viewer friendly chunk was too much; while the aim was to create a flowing tapestry of history, the movie turned out to be more of a patchwork quilt. There was an unexpected element of fantasy in '47 Ronin' which wasn't really advertised. Although what IS done is done well, the 'swords and sorcery' portions of the movie didn't really fit into place with the traditional settings and it all felt a little messy. It seemed that the creative team couldn't decide whether to keep it as a true representation or give it a fantastic spin. There were a few things that worked well too. The visuals were outstanding throughout; the bright colours and costumes were awesome and the backdrops were perfect. If I could re-watch the movie on mute then I would. It might flow a bit better that way. Keanu Reeves doesn't disappoint, although no other member of the cast was particularly impressive, arguably with the exception of villain Tadanobu Asano. In the end, I did enjoy the movie. I might have checked my watch more than a few times, and I might have laughed at some of the cliché lines, and I might have questioned certain parts of the movie, but I did enjoy it. If I could give it 6.5/10 then I would, but I can't, so it's a 6.",47 Ronin

Then I saw the first 10 minutes of the movie. With Mr. Neo playing. To top it off, they completely destroyed the concept of the story. The only thing that is equal to previous movie works with the same ""story"" and title - - is the title. The costumography is ridiculous, and out of place. Not to mention the ""beast"". Where The F. . . ck. did that thing come from. Now to acting. Of course, Keanu is one of the worst actors in my book, and the rest are no better. Wooden acting, and appalling script.

Due to being a big Keanu fan (Yes - we exist!), I wasn't going to let the bad press and poor reviews stop me seeing it for myself. It was a good entertaining film - not great, but good! Visually stunning and a good mix of emotion and action. A story of Samurai honor and tradition with some good characters and lead actors.I do however have a few issues with the film - one being the ""cheese"" The typical villain being in darker colours, with a paler complexion to make it obvious we know who the bad guy is (If his actions weren't enough)and the ""stop!"" at the Seppuku of the group of Samurai at the end to save the boy. Another plot goof I suppose I didn't like was when Kai (Keanu)is finally reunited with Mika - he tells her nothing would stop him rescuing her, when in reality, he had no intention of leaving to save her, and did so reluctantly when Oishi tracked him down at the dock. I also think the length of the film could have spent a little more time on the Demons, and Kai's history - the the relationship of the Japanese people and the existence of the demons (But the film was more focused on the story of the Samurai honor) Despite it's flaws, I think it has been given a hard time by the press, which is unfair, as it ends up reflecting in the cinema attendance.

Keanu Reeves is Kai, A Half Breed outcast who helps the 47 Ronin avenge their fallen master.47 Ronin has some problems. The first 30 to 40 minutes is slow and could have been cut into a 7 to 10 minute prologue. Some pacing in other scenes is sometimes boring, slow and makes you wish they would move onto another scene.The movie also lacks action but the action is BAD-ASS. The set pieces are entertaining and cool to see. Sadly most of them is revealed in the trailer.The Direction is good with with some sweeping shots of the beautiful landscape (some are CGI). The movie is visually great. The CGI looks cool. There is a spider scene (no spoiler) that is just cool to look at because of the visuals. The acting is also fine. Rinko Kikuchi who starred in Pacific Rim steals every scene she is in. Keanu Reeves is good...ish. The guy who plays the samurai Oishi is a bad-ass.Other problems is the lack of character development for some characters. Some characters just stand in the background which is a shame but the biggest complaint that other people have is the movie doesn't respect the source material which didn't bother me.Overall 47 Ronin is an entertaining movie with problems but is beautiful to look and has great direction. 7/10 Good but not Great.",47 Ronin

Andersen, and Khan were twisted and turned and in some cases torched vying for audience applause.On-the-other-hand, 47 Ronin mastered the Art of Adaptation and modern entertainment by creating a synergy of balance between the sincere beauty of the Bushido code, high entertainment and drawing the audience into the story by genuinely engaging their hearts. Emotionally, no stone was left unturned and audiences left crying with knowledge and respect of an ancient tradition of Honor.Yet, the heroic tale did not stop there, it touched on deeply entrenched, culturally global issues such as ""half-breeds,"" one's place in society, and whether or not Love requires society's acceptance, much less bows to Time or if it is truly eternal. Even in the Heart of Charm City, Baltimore, men and women felt deeply moved by the persuasive story. Maryland, an old borderline state between the Deep South and the North, still feels many of those cultural issues. Old terms, such as ""Mulatto,"" quietly still affect business relationships and are often swept under the carpet through hiding one's ethnicity. With International travel, it is hard to imagine that only Maryland audiences felt such depth of emotion at their viewing. One could tangibly feel the audience's outrage when Kai was beaten by the samurai and many of the affronts the character faces. The studios, director, cast and crew deserve heart-felt gratitude for their uniquely entertaining film. They ripped down society's polite façade and showed us – the magnificence of communally standing up for Honor. And that fact is quite possibly the why 47 Ronin are still revered in Japan today. Not just because they corrected a wrong, but also because they did it together.Go see the movie and walk away deeply satisfied and vastly entertained!As actor Keanu Reeves states, ""It is Life-Affirming.""

So when Keanu proves his worth, he's still an underdog, no hero build up.. just a sad story.The two main villains (snake lady and teenage ninja samurai), makes this weird ritual where she gets his heart, but turns it into a spider. She says that they are bound together forever - but you never see any warm feelings between the two ? .. why ?Keanu gets magic swords from his old friends, but he is the only one who can use it - to cut a tree - but then never uses that power again ( unless you count the fire-split a cut) 1 year passes bye where NOTHING happens, no story, no details about Kai, no suffering of Oishi, no evil plotting of the villains, no stories about the other ronin.. just woosh !the Gang Bang Seppuku in the end just makes me sad. If only someone has told the Shogun about the dragons, demons, witchcraft and whatnot he might had changed his mind, no ?.. seems pointless that 47 people commit suicide because they defended their kingdom against freaking demons !all in all: The movies has stunning visuals, but skips through the story and the details so fast that lots are lost.

The movie was set to make everything seem real, nothing to exaggerated, it depicted the story entirely as mentioned by the ancient Japanese scrolls about the 47ronin whose graves become a monument of Japan's heroic history.The world should see what true honor is, what it does, what it means, this movie showed it, the reality of the scenes, it is by heart and the love story of it is exquisite, i hope they found each other already, it has been thousands of lifetimes I'm sure. Unlike fantasy movies, i assume people who rate this with less scores expected it to be unrealistic. But as they have depicted the entire movie, it is based on reality and facts, the demons may have been over done, or the witch turning into a dragon, but it may have been possible or a metaphor in a way it described the characters. I remembered the Samurais on WW3, who killed themselves instead for honor instead of dying with bombs, and made their prime minister stop the war and cause Japan to surrender, this movie makes me love Japan even more. They are truly a great people.",47 Ronin
244,alloneloveall,Amazingly good - Don't listen to critics,10,30 December 2013,"The critics don't know jack. We loved this film from the gorgeous cinematography and CGI to the incredible detail in the sets, costumes, swords and traditional armor. Keanu Reeves' strong performance captured the essence of being an outcast in the rigid social structure of feudal Japan. The best Japanese actors did a brilliant job and bring authenticity to this beautiful and tragic story. Hiroyuki Sanada was a stand-out in his ability to portray pathos and stoic determination.Most western critics seem to be ignorant of Japanese culture, in general, and pan this film because it's not to their taste - to them it's too slow, too melancholy, not bloody enough, and they don't like the revenge for honor motif. If they had actually seen any old Japanese Samurai films, they would know and understand that this movie references the timeless black and white films directed by Akira Kurozawa and others of his era. These contemporary critics are viewing this film with modern eyes and the attention spans of gnats who are used to fast action and blood-spurting gore. Obviously they don't ""get it.""Forget the critics - 47 Ronin is worth seeing!",47 Ronin

For anyone who loves the classic samurai movies, and isn't afraid of some 21st century upgrades, it's a great movie adventure.It was interesting to see Hollywood doing a samurai movie. I was expecting to see the story compromised by giving it a Hollywood ending, but was glad they remained true to the original ethic of the 47 Ronin. This movie has garnered some criticism from purists who can't bear to see a beloved classic updated, and also from parochials who don't can't seem to comprehend the exotic idiom of bushido in an American film. Can't please everyone. But this movie does a great job of portraying the Japanese warrior mindset of 350 years ago, for all it's faults and beauty.",47 Ronin

He got his own way which let me not compare him to Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai. 47 Ronin is a beautiful movie in term of cinematography, and I want to list it as a big nominee for Academy Award for Best Costume Design.This movie is also a brilliant adaption from the Japanese legend of 47 Ronin, so it's worth for a statuette for Best Adaption Screenplay. I'm quite interested in the idea that a European-Japanese samurai defeats an Asian dragon. We are all tired of such an Asian dragon, aren't we?Another reason why I like the screenplay and the of this movie: I love to know that Hollywood keeps considering the spirit of every Asian country as an attractive lady. :)",47 Ronin

He shows a commanding use of film and framing techniques that is surprisingly good for a first kick at the can. However, the studios choice to make this film fit a more Hollywood formula sells it short. Scenes and characters were cut in order to maintain a pg rating and it leaves gaps and disappointingly dull results. In a movie saturated December 47 Romin is definitely not the worst or best, which is why audiences are straying from it. Multiple changes could have saved this film fr it's imminent demise but overall it's the dull lack listed story and dialogue that is the culprit. The story Of the ronin is extremely violent, but the film is not, which will keep both adults and younger children from heading to the theatre especially with contenders like The Wolf of Wall Street and Frozen. This film will probably have poor box office tallies but should do well on blu ray/DVD release. Worth a watchZach",47 Ronin
249,Emperor-Steve,Extremely- ...Not Good?,2,26 January 2014,"This movie is simply ""meh"" there really is barely anything notable about it, its clear that the majority of the budget went to costumes, set- pieces and some aspects of the art style, as that is really the only thing I can praise this movie on.Besides that the film is sloppy, bad plot with villains who have no motivations, random inserts that are in the movie to ""look cool"" but make no sense, are never explained and are usually just over-the-top. The writing and script is just poor, and the plot had potential I suppose but this movie is simply mediocre and incredibly uninspired, if you want to see cool fight scenes this isn't even the movie for you.There really isn't anything to say for it other than what I already mentioned, its mediocre but has some cool set-pieces and art styles, not really boring but sometimes things drag on and there is no building of character development or attachment to anyone whatsoever, acting is okay I guess save for Reeves' usual sub-par pretty much emotionless performance.

I understand the setting is supposed to be happening in a fantasy-japan and not in the real one but the cultural inaccuraties were embarrassing.This movie is really childishly black and white. Everything is so obvious that it hurts. I don't know if it was supposed to be for child audiences but considering the violence in the movie I guess not. The writing isn't really original and everything is really simple. There are also many illogical things in the movie. I could mention a couple but I don't want to spoil.Some might say the movie is visually beautiful, I'd say it's visually inaccurate. Okay, it's a fantasy world where all the samurais wear their armor all the time. Honestly I think it just makes it more childish.Also I was really annoyed by the mispronouncing of the names. But I guess it can't be helped considering it's an English movie. Also it's a thing you shouldn't base your critic on.If you don't understand or care much about Japanese culture and you don't care much about intelligent plot it might be an okay action movie to watch. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.",47 Ronin

The main character and main hero of this film contrary to the misleading studio advertising is Oishi played by Hiroyuki Sanada. Keanu's character Kai is more of a Guardian type character than a main protagonist.A the very heart of this film is honour and avenging a wrong. The film looks amazing, the costumes were gorgeous. The score fit really well. This is the best film in the world but it certainly isn't the worst and despite the very dark and somewhat alien to a western viewer concepts covered in the film I didn't find this to be a dark or depressing film.

The story and plot are good, but the movie is very slow paced and at several points turns boring. The editors of the trailer specifically picked the few action and fantasy scenes to make you believe it's a movie full of such topics. If more action and fantasy scenes were made, then it would be worth watching.Don't know why they didn't exploited the plot to get more creative and add a lot of action and fantasy sequences, like more foes to battle more magical and mythical creatures, etcetera.",47 Ronin

This is based on a historical event, of course it's embellished with fantasy. But what's the problem with that? Nothing. I bet you hundreds of years from now historical events of today will be embellished.4. Not a typical Hollywood ending, stays true to the event.5. I thought this was going to be like Van Helsing or National Treasure or some mediocre, barely engaging fantasy adventure film. It wasn't like that at all. It has style and flair. Unfortunately, judging by the critics, it won't get the praise I think it deserves. It could go the way of John Carter - a good movie just underrated. A 7 out of 10 is just perfect for it.

It's based on an incredible true story with the romantic idea of courage and honor before all at its core. I don't think the point of this film was focusing on historical accuracy but rather telling the story in a different, imaginative way and creating something similar to the fantastic anime films based on the Japanese culture. I've got to give a special nod to Keanu for his excellent performance. It would seem that he is in his zone when playing the tragic, 'the one' characters. I would say that the worst part of this film is the trailer which really doesn't give the film justice.I recommend this film to anyone who likes to get away from the real world from time to time.

It would be better, if they filmed this movie in Japan language and provide it with subtitles. For people, who understand japan manner of speaking and expressions, this movie will be nothing but a waste of time.

The Villains are too cliché in their need to kill and murder everyone, and the Good Guys too cliché in their need to protect the smallest farmer (as Samuari of Feudal Japan - not speaking of their ""Ronin"" status later in the movie). Ridiculous costumes for certain characters do the rest. Cliché Romance between underdog and high ranking woman. Its the 101 of movie making, no surprises, no tension, predictable to the end. The action is also very standart with no surprises or anything remotely noteworthy - standart swordsplay boringly choreographed. Yes Keanu Reeves plays a more ""supporting"" character which often helps since he is one of the worst actors I know. But any scene with him certainly does not help this movie.The movie feels more like either a Kids movie (age 8 to 16) or like a over budgeted film project of some undergrads learning 101 of cliché cinematography and movie writing.avoid or watch when you have no better options and are bored out of your skull (and as such I count any B&W Japanese Samurai Movie)Great material butchered by 101 of Hollywood movie making.",47 Ronin

The only reason I went to see the movie is because of Matrix and Keanu but boy did this movie suck. I saw it for free but I still feel that I've been robbed of my time. The plot is poorly constructed, some of the acting doesn't make any sense, a lot of black background to hide the lack of details and the camera guys should never work in the film industry again.

There are so many strange hairstyle and outfits as 18th century Japanese samurai and women in the film. The shogun does not look like shogun in any periods in Japan. He looked like Chinese to me. Mika, a daughter of Lord Asano, must be noble. But, her way of putting on kimono looks like whore and sometimes she dressed like Princess Leia in Star Wars. The art direction also looks so cheap. I do not know how the production spent 175 million dollars. This is the worst samurai film ever made.

Where were all the demons? I expected more. Hmm. Some nice fight scenes, but again- I expected more. The one and MOST IRRITATING part was mid-film with an unoriginal speech to rally the samurai to fight - it sounded like Bravehearts' classic, ""They may take away our lives, but they'll never take our freedom"" - oh gag me. Also not into the documentary-type intro... But in spite of my criticisms, i must say it was enjoyable. Just not quite a top of the line film. Watch for the cinematography and you'll cry in awe.

263,saltyfilmcritic,Not bad!,7,1 January 2014,"Well I, like many of you, rubbed my eyes in disbelief and confusion as to why and how Keanu could ever get cast in such a role. Although I am a huge fan of Hiroyuki Sanada's as well as the historic Samurai culture, it was more a morbid curiosity about Keanu that made me go see this film.First off, this film is visually beautiful. From the backdrops to the wardrobe to the make-up, I felt myself drawn into the environment of the film as if I was there. Very organic set design.The story was solid and I was left with only a few questions, which nowadays isn't bad. They did a nice job touching briefly on plot points and back story that could have left them with too many holes in the script.Now the acting. Sanada should have got first billing as he carried the film. I found myself only really caring about his character, and for me he delivered a truthful, believable and remarkable performance. As far a Keanu, he really did a decent job. Fortunately, though he yields a ton of screen time, much of the dialogue isn't his. Visually he fit the role, as an actor he did it justice. Yes there could have been better, but even I had to give the guy a break and admit he did fine. The Shogun played by Tagawa was also very convincing, and Asano as Lord Kira was brilliant casting. Overall, the casting department should be given serious props.Now, watching the trailer and even glancing at the poster can be a little misleading. They display a giant villainous Samurai in metallic armor and a creepy guy with his face painted as a skull. Don't get me wrong, they do make all-to-brief appearances in the film, I am just not sure why they advertised these two as if they were dominant characters. In fact, the biggest let down for me was the very anti-climactic final battle featuring that large Samurai. Don't blink...you might miss it. The ending however, was worth the admission, trust me! At any rate, solid 7 out of 10. Visually stunning, brilliant art direction, good acting, decent story and very few 'holes'. Apologies on being a bit vague, but I do not want to give any spoilers.",47 Ronin
264,dr-t-tolentino,A good and solid movie about Samurai,9,19 April 2014,"I loved this movie...The story line is an excellent that is loosely based on (as far as I can tell) Japanese tales of Ronin. Consider all the movies that are 'loosely based' on the tales of King Arthur; even if they do not stick to the exact details of the original, they make for great stories.The fighting choreography is as good as any I can recall. I LOVE the fact that the fighting here isn't the 'hokie' stupid physically impossible type of fighting you might see in John Wu movies (although, I like those as well.) What I mean is, you don't see one person spinning kick another and the victim goes horizontal to the ground while spinning many times...in the wrong direction... You don't see people flipping from a high roof and landing on the ground in that oh so cliché 3-point landing (both feet, one hand down, knees bent, and one hand behind their back for some reason... SO SICK OF THIS) The fighting in this movie, while exaggerated, can be believed... Of course, there are times when magic is used and you have to attribute that to magic...The ACTING IN THIS MOVIE IS VERY GOOD! I believe every person in this movie played their role well... They weren't cheesy, hokie, or cliché...Even the ending was not a ""hollywood"" everyone gets what they want type of ending.Now, I have seen complaints about this movie and many of them deal with the fact that Keanu Reeves is not Asian... To those of you who can only enjoy a story about Vikings only if everyone in it is tall and white with blonde hair...to those of you who can ONLY enjoy a movie about Hawaiians if everyone is big and brown skinned with black hair...to those of you who believe ONLY Asian people can use swords...Well, I suggest you get over it... Get over your xenophobic belief that only your race is good or right or perfect or the best... I am Hawaiian, and yet I believe white people can surf...A good friend of mine is black, and yet he believes that Japanese people can play basketball... Half breeds have existed all over the world since before the time of recorded history... genetic testing bears this out... So, get over yourself and just enjoy a good tale...",47 Ronin
265,Lalchemiste,Entertaining and Engaging Movie,8,26 December 2013,"I saw this today with friends and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. If you don't know anything about Japanese/Asian culture and society, you may be puzzled and disappointed by its themes and ending. If you do, you're in for a treat.The movie is faithful to the traditions and philosophies of Ancient Japan and the characters are presented as ordinary people who find themselves in situations where those values are severely tested. What emerges is a clear sense of what people of that time in that country held dear, EVEN if it meant paying for it with their lives. Honor, duty, responsibility, bravery, and submission to the law (in the person of the Emperor) all play out in this interesting and informative tale of treachery, ambition, and ultimate justice.Keanu Reeves is quite good in the role of Kai, a half-breed exile of unknown and untrusted origins who has no choice but to live humbly among somewhat hostile strangers, knowing he can never be accepted as one of them. The rest of the cast play their parts very well too.I have no idea how well this movie will do in the US because it does not follow the same time-tested formulas as other pictures. This is not a feel-good/winner-take-all/Gee-We're- So-Great-Because-We-Vanquished-the-Bad-Guys movie. If you're expecting that, you will be very disappointed.If you're more a fan of Art House/Independent Cinema where traditional, long-abandoned values are portrayed accurately and not ""Updated"" for modern audiences to maximize box office appeal, this movie will be a welcome (albeit expensive) respite from the norm. Nothing is more annoying than filmmakers imposing contemporary mores and ideals on historical figures, who obviously didn't hold them. By today's standards, Imperial Japan was a brutal dictatorship full of corruption, class warfare, and injustice. Viewed through this movie, it is seen as an honorable society with rules, expectations, and obligations, far superior and more ethical than what came before. Though it's not the modern world, it isn't supposed to be.The movie mixes history, fantasy, and legend into an fairly simple but quite serious tale and at no time does it stray from its purpose into gratuitous romance, pointless humor, or inane subplots. It is lean, stripped-down storytelling and it doesn't sugarcoat its message a bit.I'd heard that the studio was taking a write-down on this picture because they predicted it would do poorly in the US. That is a shame. I think it will do well in the Far East where its values are better understood and appreciated, not because people miss them, but more because those values were necessary at the time. You may find yourself disagreeing greatly with the main characters' choices. THAT conflict may well be the thrust of this movie. The 3D filming, sadly, doesn't add much to the movie. I maintain that at the moment we have 3D technology being used by, mostly, 2D directors. That may change eventually. Other than that, the film is well shot, but you don't really get a sense of the beauty of the country from watching it, which could be intentional.Give this movie a chance and see another culture as it was.

As Americans seems to have run out of all great moments of their short history worth making into a film or have exhausted all possibilities thereof they chose to pick from other cultures, and this time (in fact for many times over now) it's the Japanese again. But while The Last Samurai was a passable interpretation and rendering of a conflict and turning point in Japanese history, the 47 ronin is a disgrace. The plot is childish and predictable, the storyline is boring and full of clichés; basically it is a collection of overlong, pointless and immensely silly scenes (e.g.:fat samurai in river) between three or four short action scenes. The dialogues are flat and perhaps even American audiences will find them sappy (Last words of the dying fat samurai). The characters are very loosely handled, nonetheless Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada do all they can within the narrow limits the script restricts them to. The costumes, the setting, the score and the visual effects are kind of all right.

The story and the acting are both good, the Special Effects are good and there are some really cool fighting scenes. If it weren't for the title... The Story of the 47 Ronin itself is a really amazing story of honor, deceive, courage, skill and revenge. The story did not need witches, dragons, mystical beasts or anything like that. And it certainly did not need a white lead character, that saves the day.. It is a Story of Japanese Samurai or rather Ronin.

Only few scenes here and there has been good effect in 3D. Not as you expected. Some scenes with high quality background scenes are good. The Japaneses samurai culture, the houses, waterfalls, forest are only good in this movie. Even you are a die hard fan of reeves, still you don't like much about this film. Reeves did decent job for his role in the movie, not much action sequences and some eye growing scenes are missing... And rest of the actors did OK for their respective roles. As i am seeing trailers and reading plot the movie, i expected that i see more action sequences, some good magic sequences blend in and mostly the that shotgun character ta-toes all over the body actor i expect more from him but just he held in the movie for just two bit of frames.

And yet Hollywood is going to slam it for not being, The Last Samurai, which I really enjoy, or 300. 47 Ronin is one of these films that gains traction after its DVD release. It's a one of those films that has stage presence, without the song! I guess what kept me engaged in this ""Film"", was the simple fact that the West is still waiting for that EPIC martial arts movie. Not this Dancing on the tree tops crap. And though this movie lacked DTS, I didn't go to the theater to see it loudly, I went to see a mysterious retelling of 47 Masterless Samurai stage a Cou d'eta knowing damn well they're going to get tried for Treason. I went to go see Keanue Reeves flex his acting skills outside the realm of the Matrix, which he did well...he's not the same Keanue from the early 90's. His acting is not pretentious like Tom Cruise, Keanue plays humble very well. I'd like to think there is likely a Directors Cut of this FILM, and I can't wait until March or April when this will probably come out on Disc. On IMDb.com I gave it an initial 9 out of 10 stars but because it lacked EPIC like 300, I dumbed it down to 8. I liked the Film overall because all the Characters were portrayed well by their Actors and Actresses. ( Side note: Keanue Reeves plays more of a supporting role than a lead role.)

The utter vision of the films potential could have been a live action Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away. I for one would love to see a directors cut of the film on blu-ray I will buy this film upon release and it will be in heavy rotation on my TV. Universal studios please stop fing with directors visions and let them make their movie the way they envision it.Too much studio involvement ruins vision.,47 Ronin
274,FromTheInside19,Not bad at all.,10,26 December 2013,"I just saw the movie and my expectations were met. It wasn't over-hyped, it wasn't over done as far as marketing is concerned. It probably could have used a little more, but none the less... It turned out to be a fun film to watch.I am pretty familiar with the original tale and legend of the real 47 Ronin and despite historical inaccuracies, which even most stories today are going to have to create a more dramatic and exciting story like old tall tales. One comes to mind as Frank Miller's Graphic Novel 300 which ended up being film, it was widely inaccurate compared to the true events that occurred, but it made the 300 Spartans look even more awesome and exciting to watch. Most stories have embellishment in them. Otherwise they would be kind of dull. The real world usually tends to be just that.Making this film isn't just about telling a cool story, it is to immortalize those warrior's that stood fast and strong to fight for what they believed in and at the same time make them look good doing it.The visuals were great, the costume design was great, the filmography was amazing, capturing the essence of Japan was awesome. Everything down to the colors, the landscape, trees, buildings and everything. Not everyone will like this movie, but I for one would recommend it to anyone that enjoys good movie about Samurai. This movie I thought had a good story. It wasn't great or Academy Award worthy but it was good. It wasn't all non stop action. The director did a good job of building up without making parts drag and become dull.I honestly thought while watching it, it felt like watching a live action anime. Not to mention, I have an obsession with Samurai so I was sold when I saw the first trailer for the film.Overall, I thought the acting was well done, I think Keanu Reeves did a good job. His character may not have been part of the true story, but for the film I thought it introduced something good for the film. First being an outcast and then being welcomed into the fold later in the film.I also liked Hiroyuki Sanada's acting job in this. I think he did an amazing job as well as the entire supporting cast. They all acted as if they truly belonged there. No one ever felt out of place.If you want historical accurate view on the story, I suggest you buy a book or do some hardcore research into the subject. If you just want to watch a good entertaining movie full of mysticism, and Samurai action. Then this is a good way to go. This is just my opinion, take it as you like. Watch it before you criticize it. That is all I have to say!",47 Ronin
275,insulationed,Could Have Been Better,5,2 June 2014,"When I heard Keanu Reeves was in the movie, I thought it was worth a watch from just that alone. The movie was okay, but I couldn't say it was top notch. My biggest issue is with the fantasy elements added to the story; I liked the fantasy that was added, but they really did a terrible job at explaining more about that and displaying it more in the movie after teasing us with it.When the ending came around, I was expecting a big epic fight that showed off the new fantasy elements in the movie, but that was a disappointment. After seeing one epic fantasy fight, I just wanted another before the end. I also thought lots of things made no sense (especially the ending), I can say the rushed and half-done fantasy additions contributed to this confusion. I love Keanu Reeves, but I felt he stuck out like a sore thumb with the rest of the cast. I'm all for hiring certain actors for publicity, but they should have at least tried to make sure to change some things so he would blend in.A short summary of things I discussed that weren't so great: Keanu Reeves is a great actor, but seemed out of place. The new fantasy to make the movie more interesting was poorly done.",47 Ronin
276,maggey2011,An Excellent Movie,10,25 December 2013,"Simply put this is an excellent movie and kept my interest from beginning to end. The character's complemented each other and had strong performances. There is so much we can take from this movie and apply it to ourselves and how we treat/interact with the world around us. Sanada seemed to be the lead character and had a strong performance. Reeves and Shibasaski also had strong performances and displayed such strength and poise in difficult circumstances--brought me to tears. It was action packed, and the special effects were very realistic. I also enjoyed reading the history behind what inspired the movie 47 Ronin. I highly recommend this movie.",47 Ronin
277,kevinsmit1998,Good movie for it's kind,8,14 January 2014,"First I have to say that I am liking samurai movies. And 47 Ronin surprised me. One of my relatives suggested me to watch this movie because the old one (1941) was a either a good movie.I've been following his advice and I visited this movie and I have to say that I was a kind of surprised by this movie, I was not expecting it was this good actually. Especially the story was unique, I have never seen a movie with this kind of story.Also I was surprised by the performance of Keanu Reeves, personally I was not convinced he was a good actor after seeing him in The Matrix, but he has proved me that I am wrong.After all this is a good movie and I am highly recommending this movie.",47 Ronin
278,ellorint,Acting range of a statue,1,18 March 2014,"Keannu Reeves has the acting range of a statue. Seriously he has the same stupid look on his face when he is happy, scared, angry, sad. Maybe that is what he believes Zen is. I just am so enlightened I act like I went on an acid trip and never came home. Imagine the Man of Steel on 1000mg of lithium and you get how Keannu acts in this movie. I should have known better than see this movie. But it was the only thing playing near the time when I went to the theater. His movie Man of Tai Chi was better than this. At least the fight sequences in that movie we bearable to watch! By the end I didn't care about any of the characters enough to be even the slightest bit concerned of their fate. I just wanted it to end.",47 Ronin
279,mercy740,"Engaging, entertaining movie",10,22 December 2013,"This is one of those movies which could have been so much better, but in the hands of an inexperienced director and probably too many edits by the studio, it is not as good as you would expect from the budget and lavish sets.That saying, the cinematography and art direction is the most gorgeous I have ever seen in a movie, and that includes Lord of the Rings. If this movie cost 175 million to make, then every cent of it is up there on screen.If only the director put as much care into the pacing and storyline as he did into the sets! As a result, 47 Ronin has uneven storytelling. I found the first part quite slow because of necessary exposition, but it picks up 1/3rd into the movie. I also thought the action sequences were well done, but could have been prolonged. The acting was fine all round, but the women stole the show. Kudos to Ko Shibasaki for really making a passive aggressive statement and Rinko Kikuchi for chewing scenery! Oishi is the main character of this story, not Keanu's character, Kai, but Keanu always has a charismatic presence that makes every moment he appears on screen a tension-filled piece. In a nutshell, this is an entertaining piece which is not wholly accurate to history, but stays as close to it as it can.I would totally recommend everyone watching this because it's a very sobering portrayal of Japanese historical culture, which is absolutely true and otherwise foreign to the rest of the world. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie.)",47 Ronin
280,Rayjin,Keanu Reeves' comeback-film = flop,6,1 February 2014,"47 Ronin was also hyped as the big comeback of Keanu Reeves, being part of a film -cast after nearly three years. So I entered the cinema with big expectations and also in hope to warm up for the sequel of Zack Snyder's ""300: Rise Of An Empire"" because its plot actually pretty similar (a minority fighting against a majority, you know). Unfortunately this film isn't very good because I had the impression that the plot didn't have enough depth, it was like a very short summary of the real 47 Ronin's history. It wasn't the fault of the cast, I don't care if they're all Japenese, they actually played their roles very well but the delivery of the story was really horrible. The depth was missing too much, particularly the prehistory of Kayano had to be more explained in a better way.",47 Ronin
281,Chaos-one,Not bad but could be a lot better,5,28 December 2013,"This could have easily been a 9 with a more experienced director and actors. When creating a movie which takes place on foreign land, directors need to consider how well foreign actors can act on a 2nd language ie. Japanese actors on English script. Unfortunately, this wasn't considered carefully and eventually ruined what could have been one of the greatest movies of the year. It is not a bad movie but it is disappointing because this movie has such a great story and the movie was not even close to reaching its potential.Aside from the poor directing and acting. The fight sequences were not all that impressive. It would have been nice to see some better choreographed fight sequences.",47 Ronin
282,leanor-dom,Essentialy a fun movie to watch,6,9 January 2014,"I was interested in this movie since I first watched the trailer, I'm familiar with the story of the 47 and though it was sort of embellished it seemed interesting to me.I would say the movie is essentially fun. It has amazing special effects and the concepts behind the creatures are great, the characterization is also really good. I also liked the fact that they incorporated Japanese legends and mythology on the film, which unfortunately isn't a common thing on Japanese related movies. On the other hand, dialogue is simple, which doesn't exactly mean that it is bad, it isn't, it is just reduced to what is essential. I also felt like the movie went by too fast, if it had maybe 30 minutes more the story would be more complete and easy to follow. I would say actress Rinko Kikuchi is the one that stands out the most, she looks and acts amazing on her character, the camera seems to love her. I also enjoyed watching Hiroyuki Sanada.So, go watch this movie if you feel like having some fun, but don't expect it to be something intellectual or extraordinary, it isn't, but you will have a good time.",47 Ronin
283,goodnerdbadnerd,"a great cast, epic scenery, and an incredible story.",8,16 April 2014,"""For the crime of disobedience, you should all be executed as common criminals, but you and your men follow the old ways of Bushido, to honor your lord and avenge treachery. I see only samurai before me."" - Shogun Tsunayoshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa)Are you feeling properly inspired? You should be! The quote comes from the film 47 Ronin and this film is good. In fact, I would go so far as to say it is great. It's a fantastical take on an actual event from Japanese history that is revered much the same way the Battle of the Alamo is in American history. 47 Ronin takes the historic event and gives it a Lord of the Rings treatment. By that I mean: a great cast, epic scenery, and an incredible story.I know I may have lost you with my claim of a great cast, especially if you are thinking of this as a Keanu Reeves movie, SPOILER ALERT! This is not a Keanu Reeves movie. The movie features an amazing ensemble cast, led by Hiroyuki Sanada, of which Mr. Reeves plays a very small part. The film also includes Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, a great actor most nerds will recognize as Shang Tsung from the first Mortal Kombat film. In fact, the entire cast is outstanding and deserves much praise for their job bringing this epic to the screen. Sadly, the involvement of Keanu Reeves in the film has kept many people from seeing it and that needs to change.Visually this movie is amazing and needs to be ranked up there with Hero, 7 years in Tibet, and all of the Lord of the Rings films. Between the epic landscapes and the beautiful choreography, this movie is visually pleasing the entire time. The choreography is not just the amazing fights scenes; this film also does a great job capturing the traditional practice of Seppuku (Japanese ritual sacrifice) and the importance that it has in Shogunate society.Beyond the stunning, visual effects, the story is a wonderfully crafted tale about the importance of honor and the steps taken to reclaim it. Honor is utmost for the Samauri and they will go to extreme lengths to uphold their honor. In the Samurai's quest to avenge their Lord and regain their honor, they are confronted with the reality of their own prejudices and must deal with those prejudices before the true battle to regain their honor can begin. If you haven't guessed it, Keanu Reeves is the focus of these prejudices. The best part about his role is that he isn't some great white savior who will save them all. In fact, most of the victories come from the strengths of each of the individual Samurai as they face their demons.I want to tell you so much more, but that would give too much away. So I will simply tell you this: This movie deserves your time. It has a little something for everyone: action, adventure, suspense, romance, magic. you get my point! Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance, if you didn't while it was in the theaters. It is available from Universal Studios Home Entertainment, and in all your favorite formats DVD/Blu-Ray on April 1st or Digital HD now! So make sure to pick it up, you can thank me later!The Good Nerd Verdict: Thumbs Up",47 Ronin

285,eaglefanwayne,Not as bad as it was advertised,7,16 November 2019,My only complaint on this movie is that it should of been a rated R instead of PG-13. Besides that I like that this movie was kept as authentic as possible. It would of been better received with the recent racial awareness Hollywood as began to accept.,47 Ronin
286,ropiller,Nice Fantasy-Action,6,2 March 2015,For Fantasy and Action fans probably a must... Nice 3D effects and pics and all in all an entertaining action plot mixed with Japanese fantasy. If you don't expect any depth or surprising turns of the plots you may be well entertained for an afternoon but there will probably not stay much in your brain of this movie after watching it.The plot is too pathetic and obvious for my taste and the actors are nice to watch but only mediocre in their abilities and so the outcome is another mediocre Hollywood movie that is made with the typical pattern design as so many others...IMDb wants me to write at least 10 lines but this movie does really not contain enough that I would know what else to write...,47 Ronin
287,ckaz-65949,Confused fantasy samurai movie,5,3 October 2015,"Let me first say what I liked about the movie. The visuals were spectacular, from the cherry blossoms to the color of the armor, and the costumes, you can see where a lot of the budget was spent. The story was not fleshed out, however. Kai (Keanu) was some sort of half-breed which they never fully explained.The problem with the movie for me started with the hunt. Even after pausing the screen, I couldn't tell what the creature was, only that it had two long antlers of some kind. This creature and its gigantic size confused me. Was this a samurai movie or some sword and sorcerer fantasy set in Japan? I would have made the creature more believable like a saber tooth tiger. The next problem was the bad guy and the witch. They never fully delved into their story line so they came off as stale and your typical movie villain. The love story was your basic copy and paste, the Princess in love with the outsider, blah, blah, blah. The only samurai that featured was the fat one, who of course ends up dying. The movie had potential if it stuck to the basics of a good samurai movie, showing honor and duty, with great fight scenes, but it failed to deliver in the end.",47 Ronin
288,binayoli,It's good but also has plot which could have been better plotted.,7,15 May 2018,"I was with my friend at my KUSMS hostel in Dhulikhel Nepal with my friends. It was already 9:30 pm and we had nothing to do. So I was browsing through the movies that would get us through that night, Then I found this movie and we all decided to watch it as it was led by Kenue Reeves whom I have known form Matrix Trilogy and John Wick. I had very little expectation from the movie but upon watching it began to become more and more interesting and I really loved it to the end. 
 
Action Fantasy movie 47 Ronin is the combination of good action sequence and the portrayal of the true Japanese story. Kenue Reeves has shown excellent acting as well as action performance. It is not the best movie I have watched and have many scenes which could have been portrayed way better; but has the action and emotional scenes regarding Samurai order and dignity that will grip you through the end. This is the very good movie and I really enjoyed.",47 Ronin
289,sylvan_66,"Great movie, ignore the critics!",9,19 January 2014,"On the strength of this movie, if I were Japanese I'd be extremely proud of my history & heritage. This is a great film, esthetically pleasing with beautiful scenery, fabulous costumes, and well choreographed action sequences, carefully filmed to bring out the best of this beautiful land and its people. The plot is standard craven injustice & just revenge, sword & magic, good vs evil stuff which is exactly what this viewer signed up for.I want to keep this short & sweet, so if you're not looking for profound soul-searching by angst-ridden middle-aged men wandering alone through the foggy streets of nameless European capitals, then I heartily recommend an exhilarating ride with 47 Ronin!My single advice to 21st century Hollywood. Children know what blood is. Please decouple the PG-13 rating with the on-screen appearance of moderate but logical amounts of bloodshed, be it for artistic purposes only. A film where swords and arrows are only missing from the credit sequence could certainly use the realism.",47 Ronin

This was done along with KR being cast and improperly portrayed as the main character.Expect something that is just a decent story with some minor but forgivable loopholes, as well as halfway editing.Overall this movie was quite entertaining, not historically accurate nor logical in many ways but definitely worth the time and because of my interest in the culture, rewatchable.",47 Ronin
291,isams-54964,general review on the 47ronin,8,30 November 2017,"In my opinion the movie 47 Ronin is an amazing movie.The actor Keanu Reeves does an amazing job portraying the main character in the movie. The movie is about a jealous Lord that fears that the shogun favors another lord over him and hatches a plot that ends with the other lords ritual suicide. After the other lords death, his samurai, led by Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada ), are forced to live as outcasts. Oishi wanders for several years but realizes that he must turn to Kai (Keanu Reeves), a mixed-blood warrior he once rejected, to help him and his ronin ( a samurai without lord or master during the feudal period )comrades take revenge on Lord Kira. The movie has a great love story which one is prepared to sacrifice oneself for another. The movie shots like point of view and close up view. although the movie was great i didn't like that fact the all but one of the ronin had to die when they did a good deed",47 Ronin

Lots of action but not your typical Hollywood rubbish.Great cinematography, special effects, acting, story etc!And it is based on a true, albeit highly mythologised story!I simply cannot understand why some people have given it such bad reviews?!Of course everything is in the eye of the beholder!It is not just about the film but also the receiver!",47 Ronin

Action was throughout and excellent fight scenes. Up there with Crouching Tiger. All about honor in a long gone society. Just give it a chance. try not to put to much into it. Even that its based on true story, with some liberties, still a good movie to see. the background Love story also is good to watch. Keanu does a very good job playing his role as a half-breed. The other actors are great with him and all do a great job on their own. Yes, you can nic pic away at this storyline but why, just enjoy the film as it is. Good solid story all the way thru, has a solid ending. This is my first review, be nice if choosing to criticize.",47 Ronin
294,jaribrupp,"entertaining, yet hardly anything to do with the 47 Ronin.",7,25 February 2014,"There are two sides to this movie in my opinion.The story of ""47 Ronin"" was inspired by an event, which actually happened in Japan about 300 years ago. This basically causes the first problem I have with the movie. While being a fan of fantasy tales and movies, I did not understand why this film was full of fantasy elements. In a movie that calls itself ""47 Ronin"" and in the intro proclaims to tell the tale of those former Samurai there is in my opinion no room for ghosts and witches. Imagine a movie like Titanic with elves and wizards. That wouldn't work well and neither does it for ""47 Ronin"". Of course I didn't expect a documentary. But I would have enjoyed it more if it had stayed in a realistic setting.Now there is the other side to it. Had I not known the story of the 47 Ronin, I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more. Of course it's very Hollywood and not at all like Japanese Samurai movies and as you'd expect, there's the love story (basically Romeo and Juliet-style). At some points the film seems to skip some parts and then there are elements which basically add nothing of worth to the storyline. But besides those typical Hollywood elements, it's an entertaining film. The acting is good and the story has quite an entertainment value.I conclude by saying it was worth the money, but it could have been better had they actually stayed closer to the tale that it was supposed to be based on.",47 Ronin
295,vigneshprbh37,Some movies are an acquired taste,8,3 March 2016,"I have seen this movie being criticized for historical inaccuracy and addition of a 'white' actor for appeal to larger audience. well i do have to remind these people, these would be valid concern if this was a adaptation or a historical piece, like 'Lincoln' or 'the last king of Scotland'. however this is not. it is a fantasy fic that borrows from the lore of Japanese culture.just to clarify, i only am vaguely familiar with the source material. so i went to see this movie with no preconceptions. in that sense it was worth the money. in an industry that fans the flames of bloated pieces of movies, based on trending bestsellers, where actors don't do a dime worth of acting, or directors who do nothing but blow swag up in all their movies(u know who you are) i appreciate the effort,put forth, not only by the thespians,but also the director, cinematographers, even the artistic directors and set makers.yet it is inaccurate, its fiction, deal with it. and regarding casting, i understand that most Japanese, actors or otherwise have a very thick accent. i myself prefer them delivering dialogs in Japanese. its powerful, mesmerizing and not as awkward. but unless the film was made completely in Japanese, making an English movie with a English actor in one of the lead roles, help bridge the gap, and ease the experience to the audience.and kaenu reeves is one of my favorite actors. He has a niche of roles, matrix, john wick, Constantine (yes i liked it !, the movie just stays with me) which he excels in. And without any over the top antics, kaenu can deliver a respectable performance.The artwork and effects were also stunning to speakI do agree that the script could have been better, but i guess hindsight !overall it is the type of movie which you like it or not. i for one would not mind recommending this to anyoneSo there is my piece",47 Ronin
296,gothicangel_1990,A huge let-down.,3,19 December 2013,"I like samurai. I think samurai are awesome with their lightning fast katana strike and the extend they would go to to protect their honor. I also happen to think that Keanu Reeve is a decent actor who is suitable for roles such as Kai in this movie.I remember seeing the trailer for this movie in Youtube thinking ""this movie doesn't look too good, it's gonna be just another holiday action blockbuster but what the heck, it's Keanu + samurai, it's gonna have at least some merit to it"". HO BOY, was I wrong.... was I terribly wrong...47 Ronin has so much potential to be not only a decent film, but a great film. It was inspired by the 47 Ronin of 18th century Japan and happen to have a bunch of good actors and actresses who are able to convince people of the role that they are playing. The scene where all the Ronin committing seppuku was also very emotional along with the score to add a nice touch to the movie's atmosphere and further amplifies the message and feeling that it was trying to convey.The problem happens to be the direction of the movie. 47 Ronin would have been so much better IMO if it were to decide on the path that it's going to tell the story. Instead, the movie tries too hard to appeal to the mass audience and put in too many unnecessary CGI that ultimately ruin the whole movie for me. It's as though the director underestimate his audiences and believe everyone who goes to movies these days just want to watch some CGI and are unable to appreciate serious movies.The promotional poster and trailer also happens to be very misleading. Both the Demon and the Outlaw seems to have a very important role in the movie and yet, the Outlaw has appeared for less than 30 seconds throughout the whole movie while the Demon was defeated by merely some explosive. The witch also felt out of place as the character development for her is hardly there. The movie and trailer made you feel as though this is some badass action flick with some awesome fight scenes but it ends up being a mixture of everything but fail on so many levels.Forcing all the Japanese to speak in English also seems to be a huge problem for me as I find myself hard to immerse into the movie as all the dialog felt out-of-place. I think that the casts did the best they could for the movie, but nevertheless, the language of choice for the movie certainly plays an important factor in ruining it for me. I would've much preferred it in Japanese.All in all, I believe that if the movie has set itself on a certain direction by either being a movie whose main theme focuses on the way of the samurai itself without the addition of pointless CGI or just be an action blockbuster that showcases the badass-ness of the samurai, it would've gotten a 7 or 8 stars from me.Seriously, one of the worst movie I've watched this year.",47 Ronin
297,cansemerci-129-292949,Japanese movie boredom,3,21 April 2014,"This is not an action movie. Just keep that in mind. It is a Japanese culture movie, made by the western ignorance (or ignorant point of view) with all the nonsense boredom with it. I respect the culture and the Japanese people from the bottom of my heart, but it doesn't mean that I'd like to watch a boring movie with exaggerated portions of it. I love both leading Actors, thats why I added 2 more stars to my vote... honestly, otherwise I'd go with 1. basically; 1. there's no point of this movie being 3D 2. it is meant to be an artistic movie, but it is advertised as action. 3. the ""presented universe"" doesn't follow its own rules, which is always disturbing in movies. 4. if you are Japanese, you would eat your hat while watching, since you'll be witnessing the western ignorance raping your cultural values.",47 Ronin
298,aspasiks,An OK movie.,6,19 January 2014,"what I did enjoy in this movie was the cast.A movie for the Japanese.I thought it was amazing for the main star Keanu Reeves to step back in a way and let the other characters unfold,something rare for a lead role in a Hollywood movie.Personally,I would have preferred for the actors to speak in Japanese since for some it seemed a little bit off talking in English..the storyline was OK and by wonderful surprise not so love oriented.Unfortunately it was not as rich as I expected and I can't say I connected with the cast that much.I got what they were going through but their feelings couldn't reach me that much probably due to the language,I can't really tell. Moreover, the movie gives you the feeling that it has a happy ending, probably because everything went exactly as planned,while in reality it does not.It is a bit strange, yet I must admit that it was a very good effort for a fantasy film, with good graphics design.At least I enjoyed it. Worth watching but don't expect something really special.Plus it's a Keanu Reeves come back!!Enjoy!!",47 Ronin
299,tryosaurus,Could have done SO much more wrong,10,10 January 2014,"I watched 47 Ronin after checking the horrible scores it had received from both critics and people, so I went in not expecting much. Apart from the terrible acting sequences at the start I must say, I was completely surprised. The acting was decent after the beginning, the action scenes while limited were well choreographed, unbelievable of course but still fun, strange mythology and best of all, the Western actor wasn't even the main actor. Yes, they were incredibly cliché, the music was copied(but amazingly well adapted), and they added a western actor just to spice up the views. But the actor wasn't scripted stupid one liners, or given a main role even, in fact a great back story was written for him, and with his small lines I even began to like his character. The main character Oishi was well acted, although being serious all the time is never that hard of a role. There is little scenes of comedy that are funny but not annoying, the transitions are smooth and overall the movie is fun with action and anti-hero like characters. They even followed how all Samarai movies ended instead of using the traditional Hollywood ending. As I said, it might not be the most creative and original movie, but I urge you to watch it, because in this day and age its hard to find an American movie that doesn't completely screw up.",47 Ronin

It was just kinda there on the screen It felt like a lot of this movie hit the cutting room floor. if I was told there's a much longer cut of this somewhere, I'd be inclined to believe them. You barely get any chance to know these characters or connect with them in any fashion. you get a minor form of this Keanu Reeve's character with the love interest but they are barely on screen. It cuts backs every so often to her, but rarely almost as if the movie forgot and had to remind itself. This almost non-connection to these characters causes a bit of a problem when you have to feel for them avenging their master...who you also don't get to know that well.secondly, the villain... what was his reasoning for trying to kill the master? I assumed it was for land control to fill in some semblance of a story because it is never explained... and what the flying hell was the motive of the witch? she's just there as an assassin and then she just sticks around to move plot sometimes or look mildly threatening.I don't feel like much of a story happened at all and the action sequences themselves barely last a minute or two which aren't even that well shot or edited together. (I kid you not there is a scene her where the cinematographer pushes the camera down to get Keanu Reeves in frame and a couple seconds later pushes it further to the right almost as if he forgot)which is also kind of a odd, for a movie that cost $176 million to make and lasts two hours long. It doesn't look anywhere near as expensive as it appears to be. this could have been easily done with 60 million tops but it passed the time well and it had it's problems, but nothing that angered me, just kinda threw me off (I was actually more angered watching the trailer for Transcendence than i was this). I could see myself watching this again, but I can definitely see why people had it's problems with it",47 Ronin

But oh my god, did this Movie suck. 3D usage for what? Didn't see anything in 3D. Just one scene.Reeves also as poor as he ever was. But, the guy who played Oishi (don't remember his name, think it was Watanabe) was awesome. Tagawa is getting old, but is still good. It seems like, they wanted to much in just two hours. If it would be 3 hours, it could have been better. It's seems like a bit to fast. The whole scenes with those demons in the Forest could be a little longer, bit it was OK. Only those pirate bay didn't last long, which is really sad, 'cause the Location looked awesome.4/10 for good Effects, great Choreography, poor Reeves, good supporting roles and a story, which is...well say, its OK.",47 Ronin

303,cowboycorvette,Ignore the ignorant!!! Great movie!,9,2 June 2014,"Absolutely do not understand the bad reviews. The only flaws were a couple of bad lines by Keanu that should've been changed. People giving this bad reviews are comparing the true story with the movie. Why?? The movie honors and respects the true story of the ronin while adding a mythical component consistent with Japanese culture. The action sequences are excellent, the story is compelling and the true aspects of the historical components are respected. How some people can't understand adding a character to view a historical event or adding components to the story for compelling and artistic purposes is beyond me!! It is a common literary practice people!!! Great movie, ignore the morons!! The same critics bashing this excellent movie are applauding the most horrific, childish movie ever created: The Hunger Games!!!!???",47 Ronin

The movie was entertaining and had a good mix of story, action, and beautiful scenery & costumes. The movie runs about 2 hours that seemed to go by quickly. Sure, there were some things that could have been done better, such as Keanu Reeves acting, and several characters that would have benefited by additional development. One of the frustrating things is that the movie had the potential to be great had they hit the mark.

Its not only a well done movie with great cast but also well acted with a sweet touch of horror...from the start to finish was such a griping moment. I enjoyed every bit of the action...an outstanding visual effects. I can always watch this movie again and again and not get bored.

This is definitely going on my best movies list! If you don't know should you watch it or no? Think about it this way did you enjoy watching ""The Last Samurai""? If yes, watch the movie. If you watched this movie and want to see something similar watch ""The Last Samurai""! Amazing Movie!!! If you like Japanese history or legends watch this movie. If you like a bit of Fantasy, Adventure and amazing action, watch the movie. You have to watch this movie. It's a must see movie. I have really nothing, bad to say about this movie. There is one part which wasn't very accurate to Samurais, since I go to Karate. It was however a minor thing. It was something that isn't very noticeable, but I had still spotted it. There isn't any way to describe how good the movie was. The characters were perfect. The filming/video were perfect. YOU MUST WATCH IT! STOP reading this and go and watch it. It was perfect!!!",47 Ronin
309,Commentscore,"I liked it, but it had some problems",7,3 April 2014,"For the most part, I liked the movie. The acting wasn't that bad, it was pretty clean and it had some cool action parts. However, I did have some grievances.1. They all kill themselves in the end.Yeah, I know the film was suppose to represent the traditional Japanese story, but still that ending almost ruined the whole movie for me. Plus, he doest get the girl in the end! Yeah, they kiss and say ""oh Ill wait for a thousand life times blah blah blah,"" but if with the main love interest of the story, the two don't get married or start some kind of a serious relationship, I am whole-fully unsatisfied.2. Why was attaining swords so critical? We saw that the English had guns, so why not load up all your 47 guys and go gun down the place? 3. The last fighting scene was lame. Having Kai fight that snake-witch lady in the end was dull. They should have had him fight that super-tall black samurai guy, or at least incorporated STBSG in a more interesting and drawn out combat scene. 4. Needed more explanations on the ""demon-creatures."" Some background info on these demons would have been great. Understanding the emotional connection between the Japanese and these demons, and why exactly they hated eachothter would have made the movie much better. It is so painful when movies establish some sort of supernatural power, or yknow, some element that is uncommon or new to the audience, but never explains it or goes into depth on the subject. 5. They did a good job at establishing that Kira was a pretty mean guy, like when they showed him stomping that one guy's throat in, but for the witch lady, I feel like we needed to dislike her more, or at least get to know her better. Seriously, sometimes I feel like there is a better Establishment of cartoon characters, then in some of these cinema films.6. The castle sedge needed something. This whole scene bugged me. It was a good scene, like on paper it had all the elements it needed, yknow it was clever, fast paced, and they kill the bad guy in the end. But it just seemed to be missing something, I cant entirely put my finger on it. My first guess is that it was lacking tension. The ronin come in and though some clever moves and general sneakiness almost accomplish their plan. Then a fight breaks out blah blah blah Kira dies. Problem = we needed to me more scared. I feel like there wasn't enough stress in the whole scene. For the most part, the ronin just come in and roll over all the bad guys. Fight scenes need to be scary; the audience needed to be placed in the shoes of the ronin, the fear of failure, death and pain needed to be fill the air and intoxicate the audience. Instead it felt like watching that piece of crap avengers movie where all that exists is that boring, cliché, over used, stale, unimaginative, synthetic mass produced tension. 7. The CGI was not too hot. It was permissable in some parts. Yknow, a little crappy CGI in a few spots is not a sin, but when the whole concept of the new locations and environments is based off of a few seconds of video-game-esque clips. There is nothing wrong with filming a real mountain side with a cheap fsaud (forgive my spelling, I'm tired) or perhaps sprinkled with some CGI effects. REAL is always > fake. So, there ya go. My review. Sorry its pretty sloppy. Im pretty tired.",47 Ronin
310,bridgeschey,Enjoyed the Movie!,10,28 December 2013,"Went to see the movie with the whole family on Christmas day and was not disappointed. The Japanese actors has at least somewhat added some authenticity to the movie (unlike when Kung-fu/Jackie Chan played the mentor in ""Karate Kid""). Before seeing the movie, I expected Keanu to be the focus all though out. Instead, roles were mostly evenly divided with each actor contributing significant parts. My 12 year old sons favorite moment was when the ronins fingerprinted the paper. There were many pivotal scenes to note as well. I would say that the viewer has to have some understanding of Asian culture not just Japanese culture to really enjoy or understand the nuances of this film.",47 Ronin

He gets the broken English down but that is because he speaks like a robot most of the time. Seriously his facial expression throughout the movie is like he has facial paralysis. He is sad he is happy he is angry he is bored he is whatever.you wouldn't be able to tell by his facial expressions. It is like his face is frozen.

I saw this movie and read up on the history of the 47 Ronin story. Yes this movie is a more romanticized, fantasy version of the original but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. The movie uses wonderful images dipped in the most wonderful colors. The Green of the forest, The Reds and Yellows of the uniforms and even the Greys and Blacks of the evil lord and his castle. A stark contrast with the 1941 Japanese version of this movie which lasts almost 4 hours and mostly takes place in the same room. You can complain about the characters not being sufficiently developed.... nonsense. The movie takes off in a quick pace but you get enough information to understand the characters and what their role is in this movie. All in all this movie is well worth watching to anybody who sits down without prejudice and who likes to watch action movies with a wonderful dose of fantasy and a little romance. The makers had enough respect to leave the original message of loyalty and honor, which is the main message in this movie, intact. Enjoy.",47 Ronin

322,azazelofhell,Are you kidding me?,4,24 March 2014,"This title is all about direction, direction and lack of it. The Japanese story of the 47 Ronin is a story about honor, murder, brutality and revenge. This movie would have been okay if it tried to present the story of the ronin in a more realistic way (like The twilight samurai). It would have been okay if it tried to present things in a more fantastic manner. It would have been OK if it tried to be more ""hollywood"" (like The Last Samurai). It would have been okay if it was meant as a cartoon for kids. But trying to make a movie that is at the same time realistic, western, fantastic, violent and mild, is a very, very bad idea. What I hated: 1. Keanu Reeves / Kai. Couldn't the producers find a Japanese actor for the role? This cliché with the western guy helping the ""savages"" is getting really old. BTW, Kai is the second most annoying guy in this movie. 2. English language spoken by all the actors in the movie. If it wasn't bad enough that all the samurai speak English (actually ""engrish""), the fact that all the Japanese actors speak English with a very distinct accent, whilst Keanu speaks fluid English, makes us believe that the dialogs between Keanu and anybody else are carried in two distinct languages. 3. Lord Asano and the Shogun. Lord Asano is the most annoying guy in this movie, more annoying than Kai, and I couldn't wait for him to die. All his lines were delivered as if he was having a bad case of diarrhea, hardly holding it in. The Shogun was just boring. 4. The story. I was not expecting much concerning the story, because the tale of the ronins is widely known. But, with the introducing the fantasy elements, Kai, the love story, the story of this movie was completely destroyed. 5. The blood. I saw the movie last night, and I don't remember seeing any blood (except the manuscript signing scene).The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that this is a movie with Hiroyuki Sanada in it, and there are some decent fight scenes.",47 Ronin

Enjoyable viewing , great use of CGI in most instances very realistic .But the background music should have bee composed by a Japanese musician/ composer, somehow it did not add anything to the movie, tended to detract from the drama and suspense. The acting was generally good, Tadanabu Asano played the role of Akira well, not often do we see him playing a villain. The use of magic and references to Tengu was well done, probably confused some of the audience at the showing I saw. Keanu Reeves is starting to show great maturity with his roles and his choice of stories, I hope that this is just the beginning for him. The use of many well known Japanese actors definitely added to the story as many of them were strong characters within the Ronin.",47 Ronin
327,FlaviaFN,"""This film is INSPIRED by their story""",10,13 August 2014,"This is one of those movies that you love or you hate.I loved it because is made to be felt. Is a movie to see in HQ and to let in all the visuals and sounds. The photography is simply amazing and would justify per se the obligation to see the film. But then you add a good soundtrack, awesome scene fights and, specially, an incredible performance of Keanu Reeves and Hiroyuki Sanada, and you get a great piece of entertainment.It talks about honor, talks about love, justice and tradition, but with simplicity, not with intricate plots or double meanings. In my opinion not all movies have to be complex metaphysical quests to be a good experience. A lot of people criticized the screenplay, the lack of depth, even the fact that all the actors speak English in a samurai film I understand their arguments but I also start doubting if some people just lost the ability to simply enjoy a film by the experience itself, to feel the colors, the sounds, the emotions you don't need to have a character speaking all the time to know what he thinks, or what it feels for that, you read the story. And for people who weren't familiarized with this legend, like me, it was a great introduction to the theme. Maybe the narrative could be more elaborate to make justice to the legend, yes, but I think that wasn't the purpose of this film, and I'm OK with that (""This film is INSPIRED by their story"").For me it is a piece of art worth seeing.",47 Ronin

One would think with such abundance of themes to work with—the rich Japanese culture, the curious Samurai legend, sweet revenge, just to name a few—the result would be at least satisfactory. But Universal Pictures, with all of its ""glory"" and special effects ""might"", decided to turn this promising story into a trumpery fan-fest.All of the actors in this film were utterly forgettable; some of the performance are actually bordering disastrous. Sad to admit, but the monsters as cooked up by the FX department were actually the more memorable actors. Nevertheless, they were actually my biggest problem with this film: they turned such legend into a ridiculous fantasy. The wowing graphics completely overshadows what should be highlighted: the honor of the samurai, the grace of an out-casted ""half-blood"", the love. In the end, by trying to do too much, the film overcomplicated its premise, and turned it into nothing but a pot of smelly stew.There was only one highlight of the film, which is the scene where our band of 47 ronin literally put on a show to serve as camouflage for the overtake.

If you don't like him, don't watch his films. He's only been acting for 20yrs, he's always been mild, gentle.

Likely because these people went into this thinking it would be a historical reenactment of the 47 Ronin event that actually took place. This movie isn't that and contains many fantasy elements thrown into the original story. If you can't look past that, then don't bother. For those of us that can, it is a very enjoyable movie for what it is. No, Keanu Reeves does not pull out any kind of spectacular performance here, but it's serviceable and works well for the character he's playing. If you're a fan of samurai movies like I am, you'll enjoy the rest of the performances just fine. The story is interesting, the fight scenes and choreography are well done, and the CG (while it can be a little much at times) serves to further the fantasy elements of the movie.

334,FlorianFlemming,Watching this movie is nothing but suicide,2,13 November 2015,"Let's start with the positive aspects of this movie. I liked the choreography of the sword fights, the CGI Effects and Art Direction. The big budget of the movie is noticeable in every scene. Especially the fights against these strange fantasy creatures are staged excellent and were very likable. Unfortunately there is nothing more positive to say about 47 Ronin in my opinion.One of the biggest problems is that it is much too slow paced and just plain boring most of the time. The characters are not interesting at all and their intentions are not understandable or you just don't care about them. There is also practically no explanation about the fantasy creatures and their relation to the human race. You never really get to know why everyone hates Kai so much. They just keep ranting something about him being a demon. Also the romantic part, which is pretty important because it determines all the actions of the main protagonist, is only implied in 1 or 2 short scenes and is not convincing at all. You also never get a feeling for this group of 47 Ronin because they get no screen time and the only acting persons are Kai and Oishi. Just at the end you get some impressions of the spirit in this group of warriors and their great goal to seek for revenge.Until the final scene i would have rated about 4 or 5 out of 10, because it is despite all the critic a mediocre movie, which is at some points quite entertaining. But the end destroyed the movie for me. I have to say, i didn't know about the actual Japanese national myth so the final scene hit me completely unprepared. I was already pretty annoyed at this point about these odd people always committing suicide or crouching in the dirt at the feet of some laughable shogun. But this idiotic ending gave me the rest. Everyone commits suicide after saving the day by killing the evil prince and his witch? I know that this is a movie about a myth in the culture of the old Japan and not some Hollywood story, but in my opinion that doesn't matter. They are still presenting us this absurd mass suicide as noble and glorious gesture of brave soldiers and there is obviously nothing wrong with that. You cannot combine stuff like that with some dumb Disney entertainment.P.S.: Please excuse my poor English. As i am no native speaker, there will be probably many mistakes in my review.

The color asagi was considered poor for samurai, but it was chosen to represent absolute loyalty and devotion to their lord, Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu.

Good story line, maybe it's not as good as the original but worth seeing at the movie theater. You have to enjoy Japanese cinema to enjoy Ronin 47..If you're looking for a martial arts packed movie you're going to the wrong movie. If you think that you're going to see the Matrix..you're going to the wrong movie. Simply put, read the history behind the movie and you'll appreciate this interpretation of the event. Most samurai movies are somewhat somber/stoic with emotions being conveyed through movement. It's a dark movie visually but it doesn't lose it's appeal to the viewer.",47 Ronin
338,zephyrus13,In Two Minds,6,1 May 2014,"I'm not 100% sure what side of the fence I am on with this film. I was expecting ""Once Upon a Time in China"" but instead got something rather generic. It is a good film but has little to no explanation about what is going on. It is very much, so who are they? and how they can do that? Great visual effects but I would like more substance. It would have been better to be in Japanese with subtitles as well. The actual story however is flawless, a typical tale of love from a far and a hero needed to save the damsel in distress. Worth a watch but probably not to own. You are better off watching ""The Last Samurai"" or ""Red Cliff"" for a better true story adaptation.",47 Ronin

When I read that $ 225 million dollars was spent in making this movie, I thought to myself that the executives should sue the director for a poor rendition of the Japanese story of the 47 Ronin and make any and all attempts to get their money back, because tickets sales won't even pay for the bill of the catering service used during the production of this disappointing film. And as for the rave reviews by some, I have to wonder if these are paid phantom reviewers hired by the movie companies to post dishonest reviews so that the movie goer is baited; such as I was, to spend the outrageous 3D ticket prices only to have to sit through a painful 2 hours of film, which 2 hours I could have spent at my dentist's office removing a molar without the pain medicine...that would have been a better experience than watching 47 Ronin. Avoid this movie.",47 Ronin
341,oldyear2005,"The plot is rich, though not advanced, scenery is breathtaking",8,23 December 2013,"The plot is rich, though not advanced, scenery is breathtaking - these are, in my opinion, indisputable sides of this movie. All actors performances are nearly perfect - feelings are being transmitted into the audience so that no words are needed to describe emotions characters are experiencing. I guess therefore scriptwriters did not put much attention into dialogues, which are clearly left out and have plain content. I do agree that it is the culture and time that are portrayed, which are strict and clear, but even then dialogues must at least be presented in nobel way, so that the viewer will be able to admire them by interpreting those dialogues, trying to imagine that time. Some scenes are predictable (even the ones that are supposed to keep the viewer tense) Some scenes are not really clear about what they represent or why they were even put into the movies and some characters motives for doing whatever they are doing in the movie are not explicit and some parts of the movie are too short when in my opinion they are supposed to be extended to show more details, and others are too long when they should be shorter because they do not carry any significant meaning for the movie. Overall very enjoyable, but one should not follow closely every small detail, follow rather the red thread throughout the story and absorb emotions of main characters",47 Ronin

No.However, I still cant get over the fact that this movie is about a samurai's honor and loyalty toward his lord, yet when Oichi displays the head of Kira, all of Kira's samurais stop fighting and surrender. This is not a tribal culture for heaven's sake.I furthermore agree that the actors should have spoken Japanese, I would have awarded it a 6 for the special effects and global feel of feudal Japan, but English takes it all away.Finally, Tengu has a prominent nose, and is a Shinto ""kind of deity"": What are these Buddhist monks doing there ???? ......",47 Ronin

And because I love fantasy movies.BUT EVEN ALL THAT CANNOT MAKE UP FOR HOW BAD A MOVIE THIS WAS.Also, for those looking at the poster and thinking, that guy with the skeleton tattoos looks cool - don't bother. He gets only like a few seconds of screen time. Has no action scene. He has no name. He is not even a part of the story. He is just a guy with a lot of tattoos and has a single dialogue.

Unfortunately the pace of the movie just doesn't feel right. I convinced my girlfriend to watch this as i thought it would be an entertaining film, unfortunately i found myself apologising. She pointed out i was yawning too. The story is ultimately trying to portray samurai honour alongside a love story. Honestly 13 assassins captures this in a more realistic and memorable way. Not a terrible film, just lost potential and not what i expected from the trailer.",47 Ronin

We were originally put off by the critics reviews and didn't go on opening weekend, opting for the Hobbit II. However we went last weekend and I thought the movie was much better than Hobbit II. I guess the 'expert movie critics' wanted something more from the film. I went into the movie expecting exactly what was shown. A fantasy Japanese movie with exotic characters, great action, and believable fight scenes. The visual effects were outstanding, exactly what you would expect for this type of movie. I wasn't disappointed nor was the illusion pierced by bad CGI! I will watch it again when it is released on blue-ray!",47 Ronin

Aku can appear in the second part, since this is a japan full of evil and magic, its perfect that Aku was behind this the entire time! and at the same time, we will get to learn about why he is special!we need a samurai jack movie where Keanu plays jack, and this is PERFECT! Hollywood should do this!considering that the sequel will be the Story of Samurai jack and Aku, this movie will be one of the greatest franchises ever. thats why i give it a 9! its potential!",47 Ronin

It puts so much emphasis on the CGI (dragon/fox lady transforming, breathing fire, explosions, the tattooed guy, etc...) and mindless action, that all appetite I had after seeing the poster was lost after watching the preview. After seeing the preview all I can think was that this was going to be another mind numbing action movie with no plot, no emotion and all CGI.It took 2 friends whose taste I trusted to convince me that it would be a far better movie than the preview suggested.AND THEY WERE RIGHT.For those who hated the movie because it is not 'faithful' to the legend only had to look at the preview full of magical beasts, dragons and transforming witches to know that it never pretended to be a faithful rendering of the legend.Even wikipedia claims: ""With much embellishment, this true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives.""The purpose of even the original telling, going by wikipedia, is not to tell the actual truth but a 'highly embellished truth' to symbolize the code that the samurai of that time live by, and I think it succeeds at that.Overly analyzing a movie is useless, all you need to ask can be distilled to 2 questions:1. Is it worth my time 2. Is it worth my moneyIf the poster held any interest to you (forget the sorry excuse that is it's preview), the answer is a resounding YES to both.",47 Ronin

There was absolutely no point to Keanu Reeves character: his racial background, romantic involvement, mystical upbringing, or the extra monster fighting brought nothing to the story line and only ballooned the overall budget. Added to this celebrated event in Japanese history are European dockside pirates, a shape-changing witch, a troll, and an elephant sized ram like creature... all of which had nothing to do with the actual story. The saddest part of this movie was that the culture, politics, honor, loyalty, dedication, and sacrifice of 47 extraordinary men were all lost in the glare of Hollywood lights.",47 Ronin

I was really looking forward to this movie and for the most part it did meet what I expected but when it got nearer to the end and I knew what was coming I was so turned off I started packing up. I know they were trying to keep with the original story but as in most stories, this is myth, they should have considered how the audience would have reacted. As I said the ending really did it for me. If I new how this movie ended I would never have gone. Think before you go. This reminds me of another recent movie where the end did it. Gatsby.

Shall I just name the things that annoyed me followed by the positive things? Alright.-Bad acting -Rushed storyline, could've gone more into details. Adding an extra hour to the movie would've improved it so much. This is just a letdown. -Misleading poster. The guy with the tattoos is only seen like once or twice and the whole 47 Ronin are missing. -The 47 Ronin, more like 47 Boring. You only get to know a few of them, the rest are just in the background (while it's their story!) -The battles and especially the ending were boring. No 'almost dead' scenario, no tension, no challenge. The witch for example was just a somewhat 'bigger' threat than the other soldiers, and defeated without even hurting the main character.... who's not even part of the 47 Ronin (initially). -There's no love or any significant emotions in this movie. Just superficial smiles.The good things are of course the costumes, the cinematic techniques, the old Japanese buildings and fortresses, the traditions, but they're not saving the movie for me!Would rather watch a good movie, like the Last Samurai.

353,Warrent9,I do like and enjoy the story as the same way of The Grand Master been make.,8,1 January 2014,"47 Ronin is a perfectly serviceable fantasy adventure base on Japanese history. It's certainly a better movie than The other fantasy movie as story teller, which will make twenty times as much money and enjoys nearly many unanimous critical praise. Or else the world would be too boring.It is filled with gorgeous visuals, creative ones that draw a world of deep mysteries that its characters do not understand. The movie portrays a deep world, the sort that you imagine any number of stories could emerge from.It's a nice little story, one that focuses in on a more personal story, on the story of men who take up arms in order to set things right, without hampering the story with the fantasy movie insistence on making every story book. And the clan nature of feudal Japan is a refreshing setting. This is not Japan on the decline, the imperious of last gasp of the samurai. This is a world in which an honorable man kills himself (Hara-kiri) for disobeying an order for the greater principal, and thinks it is a great honor to do so. Do respect the Japanese tradition order to restore for honor of clan and family.In order of 21st. century American not at all to understand, any of the Japanese way of life and tradition up bring about principal and honor. There are consequent pay with they own life, indeed it's boring and expect more action bloody glory scene.

354,Jmaster894,Looked like a decent movie. I was horribly wrong.,1,27 June 2014,"Plot was horrible, bad CGI was used, and fight scenes were very disappointing. Only reason to watch this movie is that you and a bunch of friends gather around to watch the worst movies ever made and to make fun of the huge plot holes, bad acting, and watching a movie taking a huge dump on ancient Japanese culture.Plot was very corny throughout the movie, and was predictably bad. Seemed like something a preteen that is a super-fan of samurais would have as a fantasy, but actually had no context of Japanese culture except of how much they believe honour is worth. Like the kid that has this kind of fantasy would be the same kid that dresses up like a samurai everyday in middle school, and won't shut up about honor. Every school had that kid, and somehow someone found his made up fan fiction, and made it into a movie word for word. Seriously, just don't watch it. Life is too short to watch disgustingly bad movies. There IS a reason why this movie lost about $80 million as of right now (June 28, 2014).Note: I typed this as soon as I finished the movie, and I ended up puking in the middle of typing. Puking is not a thing I do often, and I'm not saying that this movie was so horrible and offensive that it made me throw up, then again, I'm not saying it wasn't the cause of it.",47 Ronin
355,Justin-bowman-ho,Better than expected but left plenty to be desired,6,9 December 2013,"Contains mild spoilers:For those who aren't familiar with the 47 Ronin, this film does it's best to bring the legend to the rest of the world. Although the film contains some great visuals, sets, music and costume design, infusing the story with fantasy elements and some new characters in an attempt up the action and appeal to a global audience is it's greatest weakness. The story of the 47 ronin is uniquely Japanese. It's the concept of bushido and how much one, or many, is willing to tarnish their honor in order to restore justice. Unfortunately things have been simplified a bit too much and all we are left with is a rather typical action- driven revenge plot that could have benefited from being slightly more character-driven. The original story contains a much more intricate build-up to the final confrontation that not only tests the groups patience, but their leader's resilience and cunning. Unfortunately, this film does away with these elements that made the original story so compelling. As good as the actors are (particularly Hiroyuki Sanada and Tadanobu Asano), i was definitely wanting more character development and drama throughout the film. Keanu's character as an outcast is an interesting addition although he doesn't really get much to do. His arc was fine but the character deserved more moments to shine. The villains were fine but could've been deeper. It would have been nice for Rinko Kikuchi's character to have some back story in order to pit her against Keanu in a more emotionally driven confrontation. After all, these characters were created for the film, so why not add an extra layer of depth. I can understand the desire to want to do away with the philosophical musings of bushido and character drama in order to push the action and fantasy elements, but the action, although generally exciting and visually interesting, lacked impact. I feel they missed an opportunity to really showcase the awesome fighting abilities of the samurai, instead opting for some CGI creatures and demons and a couple of averagely-lit night battles. The cut-aways seemed to cheapen the experience for me, especially during the seppuku scenes. It seemed to have been framed a bit too closely and the sound was a bit off. No doubt in order to keep it's pg-13 rating. Nonetheless, there were some truly moving moments and I found myself ultimately enjoying the film. Illan Eshkeri's score helped elevate the film's emotional scenes and I found myself with tears in my eyes at certain points during the film. Overall, I found the film to be serviceable. It had a lot of potential and it was better than expected, although I dared to hope for more. Some genuinely emotional moments and serviceable action and effects make this a good but flawed film.",47 Ronin

Is she going to bite off his hand and reveal that she's really his mother?Some fighting scene still look like Matrix, but its already much better than the previous movie (2013) ""Man of Tai Chi""!!! After one year of prison & cant even walk straight when release, the head of Samurai can sudden recover his stamina & skill in just few days.The forest beast is totally waste of money (CGI) & scene, story-line not really important. Putting a clan treat and fighting scene will be much better instead.The huge Samurai was a joke, there's no fighting scene for him after the tournament, and he just die like that, bomb!! WTH? So does those called ""special"" swords by ""Tian Go"", I was hoping some sort of power with it, end up most Samurai that hold these death just as quick as they can hold own the sword.Since one part, they mention samurai wear(take) 2swords & Keanu (Kai) is recognize as a Samurai by the clan, why ALL of them only equip one sword even in the final battle? I was hoping some fighting with 2 sword(weapon) skill!!! And why don't Kaenu use his ""quick"" move skill beginning of the fight with the snake(dragon), he could have kill that bitch much earlier & suffer less. So, all Japanese power have those Ultraman issue/problem, where they only able to perform these special skill/power end of every fighting scene?Btw the wolf aka witch aka snake-dragon aka monster acting skill was the best in the whole movie, her acting/expression exactly look like those Japanese manga, especially this manga 魔力小馬 うしおととら!!",47 Ronin

Since for me, the movie is really disappointing. I like the story and the development of the mystical things are quite acceptable, but I cannot understand the addition of Kai as main protagonist. If this movie is about the honor and loyalty of samurai, what Kai shows is not representing those things at all. And, his chemistry with the princess is so flat and has no spark. Isn't the function of Kai in this movie to bring romance? Well, I cannot feel it. I think, without Kai, the movie will be much better. The samurai played by Japanese people indeed more interesting.

I did not read the reviews going into today's viewing, however after I seen it I read the reviews and I think they got it wrong.

Make this a 100 million dollar success. It was money will spent. The story line was strong and the end was not what I wanted but true to the culture. Flow of the movie was really good and moved you thru the story with some twist and turns like a fun thrill ride. The characters were rich and loved the pureness of the staging and loved the clothing very authentic. Would have liked to see Kai develop into a stronger character in the end.

However, I was quite disappointed with story telling part of the film. Honestly, I don't think there is any issue with the selection of the story.

Beautiful movie, great acting, wonderful beasts/ monsters. Keanu was Keanu nothing over done, very adequate for his role. We loved it. Keanu will never be Anthony Hopkins, but who expects that? Costumes and visual settings were fabulous. We were fascinated and left researching the tale. Great interpretation. The spider freaked me out the most, but then I hate spiders.

If, however, you like movies that appear to have been written with some though, this is not the movie for you. None of the characters in 47 Ronin are written compellingly, in fact, the movie ended and I still didn't know or care about the names of a lot of the characters. There is no character development whatsoever and this lack of any well written storyline is covered up with gimmicky action scenes. The acting is pretty amazing and I'll say again that the visual effects were stunning but this was a film written just to make money. And yes, most films are made just for profit but this one doesn't even try to hide it. It is almost insulting.

Keanu's played a subservient role, however he managed to show courage, strength and loyalty. The message of this movie is very similar to the movie 300, without the all the blood and gore. Good to see another race and culture being depicted in such an honorable way, especially since this was also a big A liner film.The movie was well cast. I have always liked movies about myth and legends. The movie is based off a true story, however they did a great job with adding the mythical. Keanu was awesome! Well worth my $15.

Particularly liked the witch/dragon, and the alien cult scenes which added a fantasy quality to the film. I do wish the movie had been longer and the characters more ""fleshed"" out.

369,marhtisan,"Eye-rolling, groan-out-loud awful.",1,30 December 2013,"Pitiful.This movie, according to credits, was ""inspired"" by the Japanese Chūshingura tales derived from real events that occurred around 1701. Several great films have been made from these stories; this was not one of them. The only things in common between this movie and what ""inspired"" it are a few names and the number 47.Every element of this film was lacking. Plot, music, dialogue, characterization, sets & props, historical accuracy, cultural elements, sword play, pacing... everything except the pointless CG effects. You might think I'm exaggerating; I am not. I like most things Japanese - food, culture, history, animé, films, Kendo (which I practiced for several years), and so I looked forward to this movie. I knew absolutely nothing about it before I saw it last night with a friend who is also a Kendoist and Japanophile. We were both shaking our heads and groaning in disappointment throughout most of the film.There is no point in belaboring how bad this movie is simply because, unless you're a die-hard Keanu Reeves fan, there is nothing worth seeing. Even if you are a fan of Reeves, his most complicated dialogue was about three sentences of perhaps 30 words total; a completely flat performance (even for him). If the people who wrote this film ever write and produce, say, The Battle of the Alamo, I'd expect to see a Mexican bruja casting spells and fighting Jim Bowie, a pointless love interest painfully inserted into the storyline, token characters shamelessly stereotyping cultural references in bad taste, sets reminiscent of model railroad kits, perhaps some large jackalopes being part of the leadup to the last stand, and a script that any stoned teenager could write.Save your money, or see something else.M",47 Ronin
370,gragnik,47 ronin! must see!,10,30 December 2013,"I went to see the movie with my son and his friend. We sat separately and still had the same response to the quality of this film. A+ top notch! As a whole I was VERY pleased with the story, special affects, and acting. I like Keanu Reeves, but was disappointed to see he was in the movie, although after watching it I have no ill comments about the actor or their selection of him. I will not give any information on the movie other than it is a MUST SEE! Finally, I have been very disappointed with critic reviews lately and wonder if they have an alternate reason for giving GREAT movies a bad review. I give the critics a 4.2/d-",47 Ronin
371,yellowenergy31,Too Cliché,5,31 December 2013,"I thought this movie was going to be great and it turned out to be a little bit underdeveloped in a lot of respects. I think the script itself could have been revised and it was probably the root of the pretty simple plot. The movie itself could have been a lot better in terms of directing, costumes, and scenery, and most of the acting looked like it was a little phony as well. The script itself is literally very cheesy at many points, but overall it was a little entertaining but you might feel a little cynical after watching it if you had high hopes for the movie. In my opinion even the CGI animation was pretty disappointing. I think it could have been an epic movie, but it really seemed to have a budget that was a lot lower than what it is advertised as and makes me wonder if movie executives want consumers to believe a movie budget was huge just to get more people to believe in the strength of the movie. This movie definitely did not look like it used such a giant budget. The Last Samurai's budget was only 140 million, and this movie looked like it could have been made on less than 80 million.",47 Ronin
372,dunnwh1,A movie westerners can start to learn about Japanese culture,10,8 January 2014,"In short, an excellent blockbuster. If you want to learn something about Japanese culture instead of looking for a movie that plays to what critics want, go see this! The critics reviews' reveal they have no idea of the true tale of the 47 Ronin. Granted, much of the movie took artistic license by adding an unlikely romance with Kai (Keanu Reeves) and Mika (the beautiful Kou Shibasaki). Still, the movie honored the premise that the two could not be together due to class differences. Critics can't handle real life restrictions like this, and demand anachronisms that call for 21st century values of the western hemisphere to be forced into the feudal era of Japan! Other critics criticize that CGI is in the movie,as if CGI is considered a cheap trick. In reality, it's part of what makes a movie cool these days. Forget the critics, you'll have fun with this educational and historical thriller.",47 Ronin
373,dougwynne-894-553078,Beautiful on the Surface,5,12 January 2014,"I went into 47 Ronin wanting to geek out on some samurai action. As a practitioner of Iaido, I like to see sword play done right. I'm also a big fan of fantasy, and based on the trailer, I did expect that element to be strong. Sure, this portrayal of the 47 Ronin is only loosely related to the traditional story, but I'm cool with that. It's almost a shame that the screen writers tethered their cart to a well known tale, because I think the world could use more fantasy epics adorned with the rich cultural trappings of feudal Japan. A story liberated from the traditional structure entirely might have spread its wings a little more. If The Lord of the Rings can put magic and monsters in a world inspired by a version of Medieval Britain, then why not give the same treatment to the knights and dragons of the East?Overall I was entertained. The mash up of witchcraft, demon monks, monsters, and the samurai code of honor is a chemistry that mostly works, and the film is beautiful to look at. The costumes are gorgeous*, the sets, cinematography and effects all feel cohesive and immersive, and the pace is brisk. Clocking in at just over two hours, it might have been a little too brisk, because where 47 Ronin falls flat for me is in the acting and character development.The shape-shifting witch, (the true villain of the story) has some of the coolest effects, and could have been a thrilling character. Her concept and design were great. But I couldn't take the character seriously, as she was totally undermined by bad casting and weak acting. And Kai, the mysterious half-breed sort-of-central hero played by Keanu Reeves, suffers from a similar lack of depth and development. He feels grafted onto the story as a plot device, a cynical way to give Western audiences a Caucasian to relate to.The canvas may be 3D, but most of the dialog felt 2D to me. I read in Variety that the lines for the Japanese actors were simplified because they had to read the English phonetically, but at times it feels like they did the same thing for Keanu.Hiroyuki Sanada makes up for a lot of this in the role of Oishi, arguably the main character, even though you won't find his face on the posters. I've enjoyed his acting in everything I've seen him in so far (check out The Twilight Samurai for something more authentic) and he really carries this version of 47 Ronin on his back. The story of his quest for revenge feels like it has some weight. The risk and cost to his family actually resonates, but isn't given enough time at center stage because we're distracted by a forbidden love subplot between Kai and the daimyo's daughter Mika. This love story is an element that ends up lacking that same resonance, in spite of overwrought attempts to invoke passion simply by viewing the relationship through a lens tinted with the beauty and poetry of old Japan.Forgive my harping on the comparison, but if the Hobbit movies are too long (and I think they are, much as I loved the LOTR trilogy) then 47 Ronin may well be too short. Other unfulfilled potentials included the story of how Kai trains and acquires his sword skills on the Dutch island of Djema where we get a brief look at a cool character tattooed with a skull face. Unfortunately, this guy is just another element that teases us in the poster and trailer, but gets little screen time.After reading the awesome novel, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet by David Mitchell, I was hungry to see more of Djema, and hoping that the filmmakers might exploit the potential for bringing out some of Kai's backstory there, or at least digging into the rich juxtaposition of cultures offered by the Dutch island, but no. Didn't happen. By the way, if you want a story that blends samurai culture and Japanese history with subtle sorcery, do yourself a favor and read that book. It does a much better job in the romance department as well.By the end of the film Kai's character is as much of an enigma as when we first met him crashing out of the forest with claw scars on his head. An unsatisfying journey to be sure. But I do have to give the filmmakers some credit for keeping to the traditional ending, and guaranteeing that there won't be a sequel.*Beautiful as some of the costumes and armor were, they did lack the feel of things broken in by use. For a close-up look at some authentic samurai armor, there's a gallery of photos my wife took at the Samurai Arms and Armor exhibit at the Boston MFA on my blog at dougwynne.com",47 Ronin

The Character Designs are really Great! The Witch is Mix of a Japanese classic Monsters. the Environments are Beautiful. the matte paintings are just amazing! but there's one problem that it's not really how Japan really looks like. I guess that's the reason why many Japanese people disliked the film. at some parts of the film you really can't recognize the real japan here. but considering the fact that the movie is a Fantasy mix, it's acceptable! you feel yourself like in a Japanese Fantasy land that never existed.

376,uspasojevic96,"Very, very, very bad",1,15 January 2014,"Yesterday I watched this movie only because I life Japanese culture. I am very disappointed, there are many flaws in the movie, especially during ship scene, explosions out of nowhere, muskets obviously should have hit them, there was even a split second during jump where you could see Keanu Reeves being hit and later after that he is intact. At tournament or whatever was it at beginning when Keanu was fighting that spirit imbued armor, he could have spoken about the witch to everyone, but no he had to shut up. Also the only good combat was during the sword gathering, not counting the assassination during the show for wedding, the movie was more focused on wedding than on assassinations of guards. There was also a mistake during one of assassinations, when guard noticed what was going on and when he wanted to fire an arrow at Oishi, but Oishi's son shot the guard before he could aim properly, yet he hit Oishi in arm, which is impossible. During last fight (Keanu vs witch), when witch transformed into her real form, she kept falling back, she never once took charge of attack, she was constantly being defensive and kept attacking surroundings more than she went for Keanu, also it is stupid for fight to be ended in 1 shot (shadow walk and stab thru muzzle which should not have been fatal). The only good thing in this movie is upholding of samurai code (bushido) and the act of dying honorable by seppuku.",47 Ronin

I saw yesterday and many people on the section room was telling a lot of good things about the movie. The movie is basically about fantasy and action adventure, not a fidelity from the real legend of the 47 Ronin.... and its is said on the end of the movie, its is based on the history... it is about the honor and death. I believe that the ""critics"" do not like Keanu Reeves because he gives a s**t for the press and media, he does the movie as it should be done, that's it. They always trying to minimize the actor, all the times, his movies are good overall. I think that if is another actor is his place, the critics would be different from their scores..., just go to watch it, is enjoyable and you will not see the time passing. the 3D effects are not wow, (really unnecessary).

It is absolutely ridiculous to hear Samurai speaking in English to each other... not just the Samurai, everyone in the movie did! Talk about respecting one's culture. The plot is highly predictable. The acting is nothing exceptional. I am not familiar with the original 47 Ronin legend but I'm pretty sure there was no fighting against a flying lizard. I would be upset if I'm a Japanese. The 3 stars are for CGI, music, and investment to the economy. The only good thing 47 Ronin has contributed is making Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai a legend of its kind. Oy vey.",47 Ronin

I was so offended and angered just by the narrated introduction alone that I couldn't bring myself to sit through the movie.

382,lr-cherng,A fantasy retelling of all of human history,8,16 May 2014,"One of the things the movie does really well is create subtle variations on the rather familiar samurai film, in terms of costuming and scenery. There are some vibrant colorful scenes but in retrospect the movie's colors are muted, like the acting. Since the samurai film and setting is already so familiar, that tradition becomes a backdrop from which to spot some easter eggs of influences of other Asian cultures, and a lot of play on stereotypical appearances. Kai is unknowable, like any character played by Keanu. We learn about his origins in the movie, which is awkward. It's like we see him as a boy, and then there's this flash forward to when he becomes Keanu-age, but the viewer and his companions still don't know much about him. There's something to be said about Kai's origins. The Tengu forest is the most centrally-magic place in the film, the sanctuary, if you will. And so but it's the place from which each of the protagonist samurai procures their weapon. That the power to win came from the mouth of the monk's cave signifies that their reason for winning is that its a story. Where the actual 47 Japanese men summoned the power to win their fight is unknown, undepicted. The story of revenge is universal, and the code of Bushido is only referred to once and as the old way; the story is speaks to me because in the end the atmosphere is like isn't that what anyone would do?",47 Ronin

Which if that was the basis of my review, I would actually have something nice to say about this film. It's aesthetics are wonderful. Sadly, however, this film fails in all other aspects that a film should strive to accomplishing. The 47 Ronin, for those of you who do not know, is a tale dating back into Japan's Early Modern Period. This film attempted to recreate this tale and failed miserably. Though the basic premise of the story stayed the same, the necessity of Hollywood to turn this story into an example of the ""white man's burden"" during a period in which no white man set foot onto 99% of Japanese lands, is insulting and appalling. My issues do not rest at lack of accuracy to either the original story or Historical truths. The random plot lines that led nowhere but a place to create glamorous and ascetically pleasing scenes to put into the trailer, and the pointless conflicts developed between the main character and other random groups (the Tengu and the Dutch) was not only confusing and pointless, but also distracting. Though I suppose with how bad the rest of the film is, a distraction is not such a bad thing.",47 Ronin

There are also many other inconsistent culture elements. For example, women in Ancient Japan would not are to act what the ""Lady"" of Ako had done in the movie. Another inexplicable thing is that if the witch is so powerful, why Lord Kira bother to come up such as a devious but cowardly and mundane scheme of using poison to delude the lord of Ako to attack him? He could have use the power to get rid of or control Shogun Tsunayoshi instead.

For me, a good movie doesn't make you think about this parameters until is over. With this movie, it wasn't the case.It seems that the director really liked ""300"", ""the last samurai"" and ""crouching tiger hidden dragon"", Because this movie tried to have the photography of the first, the emotion of the second and the fantasy of the third. I said tried because it didn't deliver any of those three.Technically speaking post-production is poor in this movie, for example in one hand they worry about the color filter but don't care about proper lightning. It seems that it was edited by different teams because there is no commitment with a unique style. The CGI was bad, too noticeable, but the worst thing is that it was unnecessary.In the case of the narrative, the beginning is presented so quickly that it doesn't have any relevance, there is no emotional bond between the spectator and the characters. Later, there is a love that comes out of nowhere, you have to assume, imagine a situation because the movie just skip to the part where the 2 characters are really in love. And then, when you are trying to swallow that gap in the story you crash with a really sinister character, that you never come to understand completely, because it feels a deep hate to a family, that is absolutely random. What have they done to you?, why do you hate them so much?. And so on, the pre-climax part feels equally random and the ending left you wondering ""why didn't the main character do that earlier?"".In ""the last samurai"" i liked the way they presented the concept of commitment with a belief, the ""way of the samurai"" in a romantic way. Well, this movie tried to do the same but stumbling on contradictions every 5 minutes. Maybe because they tried to add too much things to an already good story.About the music, inexistent, do you remember the main theme in ""the schindler's list""?, ""jaws""?, ""predator""?, ""the godfather""?, ""starwars""? ""rocky""?, ""titanic""?, ""jurassic park""?, well that will not happen with this movie.About the acting, really poor(including Keanu Reeves), except in the case of Hiroyuki Sanada.

It is a beautifully told story with a little bit of supernatural fantasy mixed in for good measure. The fighting scenes were a beautiful dance, very graceful. This movie is full of action, honor, supernatural fantasy, and a little bit of romance. Shame on rotten tomatoes, they gave this great movie a 16% and it should have been rated at least 90%. I wonder if they even watched the movie or just the trailer, or if this just was not their type of movie, no cursing or sex scenes, not violent enough for them. Or is it because Rotten Tomatoes is owned by Fandango which Warner Brothers retains a minority stake in and 47 Ronin is not owned by Warner Brothers or Fandango.

The most fun thing about it is the fact that it tries to be so serious.Firstly the fact that they all speak English, since there is one American actor in it, is funny. It makes the movie loose its credibility, as it's supposed to be a movie from Japan, with a bunch of Japanese people. Akira Kurosawa would turn in his grave with laughter.Secondly there seems to be a lack of intelligence amongst many of the main characters in the movie, that makes u wanna go and smack'em over the head, and make a movie that makes fun of the movie.Then thirdly, the heroes are super content with getting the order of an honourable death as the gift for their bravery by this cloak veiled idiot that is supposed to be the Shogun. Again, I feel tempted to make a movie that makes fun of the movie, and allow some random soldiers to smack the fool over his head, and request him to turn to reason, and stop taking himself so seriously!This movie seriously is a huge source of comedy.

Even Japan is beautiful and movie tries to show that in some scenes, it didn't work out for them. 3) Blood - coming to watch this movie , I expected lots of blood. Well.. lets say this way - Whenever I go to donate blood to sick people, I've got more of that in that small pocket than I saw in this movie.On Overall :If you want to just relax and spend some 2-3 hours of doing nothing, then grabbing a beer and your wife next to you on Thursday eve on a couch, this movie is great ! You will enjoy your evening after work. But if you want to be excited about something you just saw - better take a look what else is going on in cinemas. Don't put too much expectations towards this movie, because it is not , what you might expect.",47 Ronin
