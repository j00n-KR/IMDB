0,MartinHafer,Creepy---MEGA-creepy...and I really hated that chicken!,5,24 April 2014,"""Return to Oz"" is not the sort of film I'd normally watch. However, my daughter insisted I needed to see it simply because the movie was so incredibly dark and child-unfriendly. This had my curiosity piqued--and I finally got around to seeing this film.Soon after the film started, I saw just how dark it was. In this semi- sequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"", it picks up several weeks or months after the previous film. However, continuity and realism is the key--the Gale family home is NOT magically restored like in the previous movie but WAS destroyed in the storm. As a result, Dorothy's uncle has PTSD! But even worse, when Dorothy regales her aunt with her stories of Oz, Auntie Em thinks Dorothy has lost her mind. Eventually, she takes Dorothy to an ultra-creepy clinic where a psychiatrist is planning on giving her shock treatment to stop these delusions!! Just after Dorothy is strapped down and she's about to receive a bazillion volts of electricity, a little girl shows up and saves her--and whisks her magically back to Oz.Oz has changed a lot since Dorothy left. The Nome King and Mombi (who are Oz incarnations of the evil psychiatrist and his nurse) have destroyed everything and the Emerald city is in ruins. So, it's up to Dorothy and some creepy new friends to right everything and make the kingdom a happy one once again.If this doesn't sound like a good film for your kids, you are correct. It's a film I would never dream of showing to younger kids--this would be like child abuse. But, for older and more cynical folks, it's a neat re-imagining of the books. However, there IS one major problem regardless--and reason I disliked the film. Dorothy's companion from home is NOT Toto (who is a Border Terrier in this film instead of a Cairn) but a super-annoying chicken. The voice is just awful and the comments are very often obvious and banal. I truly hated everything about this character--even if she did, inexplicably, help to save the day. I'd have just roasted her!!Also, because Kansas is so dull and awful, why in the heck did Dorothy want to return?! She MIGHT have gotten shock treatment or been lobotomized!!!",Return to Oz
1,TheLittleSongbird,A severely under-appreciated gem!,9,15 June 2009,"I honestly do think this is under-appreciated. I know it is more sombre in tone than the 1939 classic, but that's not a bad thing at all. The film does look beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, and the special effects work is some of the best of its kind of any family film of the 80s or of any decade, Tick-Tock and the Nome King are brilliantly designed. Return to Oz, with its very imaginative storytelling- seen in memorable scenes like with the heads- and enchantingly dark atmosphere, also has enough magic to engage the viewer, well to me it does anyway. The climax is chillingly effective, though Nome King did seem to be defeated too easily. Fairuza Balk is excellent as Dorothy, charming, sincere and even adorable. Many have complained that Balk is too young for the character, but in the 1939 musical Judy Garland was nearly 17 when in the book Dorothy is about 12. I also loved the music score and the cinematography, which was both dreamlike and nightmarish. Another mention should go to Nicol Williamson in the duel roles of Dr Worley and the Nome King(who may be a bit too scary for young viewers, likewise with the character of Mombi), he did a truly wonderful job in both roles, particularly the latter where he was threatening in an understated way. Also to Pumpkinhead, who a number of times, came close to stealing the show, and Tick-Tock, whose personality is perhaps the most colourful of all. The only character I didn't care for was the chicken, who is annoying at times and not really that necessary. Overall, this is a truly excellent film, that I think deserves a lot more recognition. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",Return to Oz
2,Leofwine_draca,Underrated sequel,6,28 May 2016,"RETURN TO OZ, the sequel to the 1930s classic, was a massive flop when it was put out by Disney in 1985, which is why I doubt many people today know of its existence. Having just watched an excellent quality, high definition copy of it, I was surprised at how entertaining it is; it's no masterpiece for sure, but it has the edge on the recent OZ: THE GREAT AND THE POWERFUL put out by Sam Raimi.Yes there are disparities when compared to the original film but this was intended to be more in line with the L. Frank Baum novels than the MGM classic. Fairuza Balk is an effective choice as a younger, wide-eyed Dorothy, carted off to a mental asylum and then transported back to Oz where she discovers a terrible tragedy has befallen the Emerald City. Soon she's hooked up with a new group of allies to go on a brand new adventure.In my opinion, the 1980s was the pinnacle of the special effects film. Animatronics and prosthetics were the best they were going to get, and computer graphics were in but had not yet overwhelmed cinema. RETURN TO OZ is a great film for effects fans: all practical, all great looking, particularly Nicol Williamson's Nome King. I got a chuckle out of seeing Jack Pumpkinhead, a character that storyboard animator Henry Selick would later 'borrow' for THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas. Tik-Tok is another good creation, full of character, but my favourite is Billina.RETURN TO OZ isn't a perfect film, as it does feel a bit uneven in terms of pacing and the opening sequences are perhaps a little too dark for kids. Jean Marsh is overwrought and ineffective in her role too, and should have toned things down a bit. However, the sheer effort that has gone into the world building, and the genuinely suspenseful extended climax, make this a fun movie. And it's impossible not to love the painstaking effects work - including Claymation - that's gone into the production.",Return to Oz
3,jboothmillard,Return to Oz,5,29 May 2013,"Forty six years had passed since the classic musical The Wizard of Oz was released, and Disney decided it was time for there to be a sequel, since there were the books to base a story on, but with some rather significant differences. Basically it has been six months since Dorothy Gale (introducing The Craft's Fairuza Balk) and her dog Toto were transported from Kansas to the magical land of Oz somewhere over the rainbow, and she cannot sleep thinking about it, and this is worrying Auntie Em (Piper Laurie) and Uncle Henry (Matt Clark). Since they are concerned for her, talking about imaginary places and people so much she is taken to a mental hospital for electro-shock treatment, but with another mysterious girl she manages to escape going down river in a chicken coup. After surviving some rough waters Dorothy wakes up in the land of Oz, and the chicken Billina (Mak Wilson, voiced by Denise Bryer) is talking, but the land has been destroyed, including the Yellow Brick Road, Munchkin City and the Emerald City, and she finds her friends the Cowardly Lion (John Alexander) and the Tin Man (Deep Roy) have turned to stone. Exploring the ruins she finds a clockwork mechanical man named Tik-Tok (Tim Rose and Michael Sundin, voiced by Sean Barrett), who tells her that the king of Oz, her friend the Scarecrow (Justin Case) has been captured by The Nome King (Nicol Williamson), who destroyed the land. Dorothy, Billina, Tik-Tok and new friends Jack Pumpkinhead (Stewart Larange, voiced by Brian Henson) and Gump (Stephen 'Steve' Norrington, voiced by Lyle Conway) are now on a journey to try and save the land and the people turned to stone. As they journey, avoiding the Deadly Desert and heading for the Nome King's mountain and domain, The Nome King himself, a rock creature, appears and explains that he kidnapped the Scarecrow as he stole emeralds from him to build the Emerald City. He has turned the Scarecrow into an ornament, and the Nome King, who has also taken the Ruby Slippers, gives each of them the opportunity to guess which of the hundreds in a room it is, Dorothy correctly guesses after spotting a green ornament. The Nome King in anger tries to eat the friends, and in panic Billina lays an egg which is thrown into the monster's mouth, eggs are poisonous to Nomes and he crumbles, the Ruby Slippers are returned, the land is restored and everyone turned to stone are freed. In the end the girl from the mental hospital appears, it is actually Princess Ozma (Emma Ridley), Jack's creator and the true ruler of Oz, Dorothy is sent home but is promised to return whenever she wishes, and she is asked to keep the existence of the magical land a secret. Also starring Jean Marsh as Nurse Wilson and Mombi the Witch, Sophie Ward as Mombi II and Fiona Victory as Mombi III. Balk is likable as the little and younger Dorothy, certainly not as memorable as Judy Garland but not bad, and the new characters introduced as her companions are sweet, I certainly see that this film has a darker side, and this is not a musical like previously, I agree the animation for faces in rocks and Claymation is impressive, this is easy to digest entertainment, a fun family fantasy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Effects, Visual Effects. Worth watching!",Return to Oz
4,Tweekums,A return to a darker Oz,8,29 June 2010,"I hadn't really given any thought to this film until I read a film blog discussing films which frightened viewers as children and several people mentioned this so I decided to watch it even though it is a long time since I was a child. I'm glad that I did as it was a great film containing scares, thrills and some fine new characters. Like just about everybody else I was familiar with Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy and was interested to see how another actress would approach the role; it is immediately clear that Fairuza Balk's Dorothy will be quite different, for a start she is several years younger and somewhat more troubled. Her family don't believe her story of visiting Oz and take her to a rather creepy hospital where she is to undergo electro-shock treatment. Just as the treatment is about to start lightning causes a power cut and Dorothy escapes with the help of a mysterious girl. As they flee they fall into a swollen river and Dorothy climbs onto a makeshift raft and falls asleep. When she awakens she is shocked to find that she has a talking chicken for company she soon realises she must be back in Oz and sets off towards the Emerald City to find her old friends. Things start badly when she discovers that the yellow brick road has been destroyed and get worse when she finds the Emerald City itself is in ruins; its population have been turned to stone and there are strange and dangerous creatures called Wheelers patrolling its streets. While hiding from them she finds a new friend; a clockwork soldier called Tic-Tok who helps her fight off the Wheelers and gets the information she needs to find the Scarecrow. This doesn't mean her problems are over, she must still confront Princess Mombi, a frightening woman who has a collection of interchangeable heads who wishes to add Dorothy's to her collection and the Nome King, the rock monster who is holding the scarecrow.Young Fairuza Balk did a great job as Dorothy, it can't have been easy for an eleven year old to take on one of the most iconic roles in cinema history. Those wanting to see her old friends may be a little disappointed as they only play a small part in her adventure however her new friends are a lot of fun and even stranger... one is a creature made up of a green moose head attached to a sofa. A few of the special effects look a bit dated now but in the case of the claymation rock creatures this just adds to their creepiness. This film is considerably darker than the original; the previously bright World of Oz seems to be in a terminal state of decay and there are no bright songs to lighten the tone. I can see why it would give some children nightmares, the wheelers, Mombi and the rock creatures are all positively creepy and there is a far greater sense of danger this time.",Return to Oz
5,moonspinner55,"Intriguing and well-cast, but not exciting enough...attention flags even as the style of the picture commands respect",5,2 April 2011,"Once the Disney Studios began billing this adaptation of three books by L. Frank Baum (""The Marvelous Land of Oz"", ""Ozma of Oz"", and ""Tik-Tok of Oz"") as a 'sequel' to MGM's 1939 musical classic ""The Wizard of Oz"", this picture had little hope of reaching a wide, non-cynical audience. Of course newcomer Fairuza Balk could never equal the success of Judy Garland's incarnation of Dorothy Gale, but the young actress gives it an honorable try (and--surprise!--she's the best thing in the movie). Desperately unhappy being away from Oz and the characters she fell in love with there, Dorothy flees from a psychiatric institute and winds up once again walking down the Yellow Brick Road--only this time the magical trail has gone to seed, as has the Emerald City. Upon meeting a new group of friends, Dorothy hopes to save the citizens of Oz from the evil Nome King. Some of the visuals here are perhaps too dark, and the episodic nature of the movie (as well as its relentlessly downbeat tone) is wearing, yet this still ranks as a very commendable attempt to put Baum's ideas to film. Intelligent children and curious adults should be pleasantly surprised. ** from ****",Return to Oz
6,Quinoa1984,"a dark, crazy story that is perfectly fine for children! really",7,5 March 2015,"I don't see why people got into such a hubbub about Return to Oz when it came out... actually, that's not correct for a couple of reasons. For one, sadly, it didn't do well at the box office, so presumably a lot of children didn't see it who might have. But for those that reviewed it, the consensus was it was ""too dark"" for kids. Hogwash. Kids can actually take much more dramatic and terrifying things than we think - maybe some may be more sensitive than others, but so are adults - and a response to feats of imagination are always eye-catching to them. If it was about the story and characters, that's another matter.On an artistic, sensory-visual level Return to Oz is mostly spectacular work, with a plethora of eye-catching and inspired practical effects (one of which I have to imagine the character of Jack Skellington was the inspiration for), matte paintings, marionettes and puppets, claymation, the works, with an Emerald city that looks like a Russian communist block from that time period (and I mean that in a complimentary way - it's exquisitely run-down) . And I liked how dark and weird it got, that was fine.If I didn't care for something it was most of the supporting characters who become Dorothy's companions. They didn't have the strong-memorable personalities or sense of enchantment (or even just good acting) of the three that accompanied Dorothy in 'Wizard' - or, hell, even the companions in Oz: The Great and Powerful, which I'd argue is maybe a more inspired film than this, albeit with CGI. And the villain - aho is appropriately bad-*ss and deranged, is only most effective by the third act, with a one-dimensional shrieking witch (albeit with wonderful multiple heads to choose from) in the rest of the film.So, Return to Oz is a really good movie. If it's a lost classic? Depends who you ask, I suppose. Nevertheless, Balk is fun to watch in a role where she's constantly thinking and reacting well in her acting - a sophisticated acting job young or otherwise.",Return to Oz
7,wes-connors,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,5,13 August 2011,"After her visit with the wonderful ""Wizard of Oz"", young Fairuza Balk (as Dorothy Gale) returns to her Kansas farm. Everyone assumes her adventure was a dreamy psychological reaction to the devastating tornado, but ""Dorothy"" keeps insisting the trip was real. Her increasingly desperate Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take their troubled niece to a doctor specializing in electric shock treatment, then considered a promising treatment. She meets mysterious blonde Emma Ridley (as Ozma), who helps her escape from the hospital during a storm. A ""Return to Oz"" finds the Emerald City is in ruins and everyone turned to stone. This amounts to a good production, but with some serious miscalculations in execution.***** Return to Oz (6/21/85) Walter Murch ~ Fairuza Balk, Nicol Williamson, Jean Marsh, Piper Laurie",Return to Oz
8,Coventry,"We're off to see the Sequel, the wonderful sequel of Oz",7,12 December 2005,"Cherubic Dorothy Gale is catapulted back to the magical world of Oz in this enchanting, but very atypical Disney Production that got released 46 years after Victor Fleming's original (none of the original cast-members lived long enough to ever see this sequel!). In the story, however, only six months have passed since Dorothy was brought to Oz by a tornado. During some medical tests, performed because she keeps talking about her unbelievable journey, a mysterious girl helps Dorothy escape from the hospital and back to Oz for a new adventure! The screenplay, based on two L. Frank Baum novels at once, introduces a large amount of imaginative new characters that are either Dorothy's loyal friendsor malicious new enemies. It soon becomes clear that she was called back to Oz for a reason, as the evil Nome King has turned everyone to stone and the mad Princess Mombi is after more human heads for her collection. Despite the presence of a talking chicken, this is a frighteningly grim and obscure fantasy tale, perhaps not even suitable for the typical Disney-target groups. The events and characters in ""Return to Oz"" are often quite macabre (decapitation for a hobby, eerie guys on wheels) and the tone of the film is heavier since there isn't any singing and dancing going on. Perhaps a little too scary for the smallest children but ""Return to Oz"" nonetheless is a compelling and spontaneous adventure, highly recommended to those who like their fairy-tales sinister. The special effects are really terrific, with stunning stop-motion animations and some very engaging mechanical machinery (Tic-Tok!). The young Fairuza Balk is an unbelievably convincing follow-up to Judy Garland! The talented Piper Laurie (""Carrie"") is regretfully underused, though. This film, along with ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""The Neverending Story"", was a huge favorite of mine when I was young and they seemly only got better with years. Good stuff.",Return to Oz
9,Bunuel1976,"RETURN TO OZ (Walter Murch, 1985) **1/2",6,25 January 2008,"This is just one of a number of follow-ups to the classic 1939 version of THE WIZARD OF OZ, but it's only the second I've watched  after the animated feature JOURNEY BACK TO OZ (1974). Here Dorothy (played by 11-year old Fairuza Balk when Judy Garland herself had been 17!) has different companions throughout her journey: a hen called Billina instead of Toto the Dog, Jack Pumpkinhead rather than The Scarecrow, a Tin Soldier named Tik-tok replaces the Tin Woodsman and Gump, a Moose (or, rather, Moose's head), stands in for the Cowardly Lion. There's a new good fairy as well (she goes by the name of Ozma!)  not to mention fresh villains: the Wizard this time around is the evil Gnome King (who doubles as a maverick psychiatrist in real life  Nicol Williamson appears as both) and, of course, we get yet another witch (played by Jean Marsh and who's also the strict nurse at the institution where the disturbed Dorothy is being treated). Piper Laurie and Matt Clark are saddled with the somewhat thankless roles of Dorothy's relatives.While featuring splendid claymation effects by Will Vinton, this is somewhat macabre for a kiddie film  with the witch storing a variety of living heads in a showcase (which she can exchange at will, though it's never explained for what reason); it's also dreary-looking, with the general tone being rather somber throughout (there are no cheerful songs to be heard here)! This was famed editor/sound designer Murch's sole stint at direction; he also co-wrote the script, which was inspired by two of L. Frank Baum's ""Oz"" books (one of which  ""The Land Of Oz""  I've owned since childhood).",Return to Oz
10,neil-476,Oz with sharp edges,8,24 June 2010,"The 1939 musical is, without doubt, one of the greatest movies of all time. But, until this effort, Baum's source material was never returned to.The musical version has some dark moments: this non-musical sequel is considerably darker throughout. There is some fabulous visual imagination,, some brilliant parallelling of real life with Oz (better than was done in the 1939 version), and some excellent performances, particularly from the young Fairuza Balk as an altogether grittier, if less melodious, Dorothy than Judy Garland. Jean Marsh is a chilling Mombi and Nicol Williams is a rather hammy Goblin King, albeit brought to the screen via some first rate clay animation.The music is also excellent - atmospheric, jolly at times, and eerie at other times.Well worth catching, and a worthy companion piece to its predecessor.",Return to Oz
11,morrison-dylan-fan,Returning to OZ.,10,16 August 2020,"After The Black Cauldron (1985-also reviewed) became my first viewing on the streaming service,I decided to check what other titles from 1985 were on Disney+. Having seen photos and read about it over the years,I was excited that the one other Disney film from that year,would allow me to visit a very different kind of OZ.View on the film:The lone time he has ever directed a feature film, (his lone other directing credit is the Star Wars:The Clone Wars ep The General (2011)) co-writer/(with Gill Dennis) director Walter Murch displays a breath-taking level of inventiveness, clicking those red ruby slippers from Stop-motion animation to the Steampunk practical effects of Tik-Tok with what appears like a effortless ease of transition.Sacked by Disney early into filming, due to budget concerns,until Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas lobbied for him to get rehired,which the studio did, but, got their own back,by cutting the budget,and giving it little hype, guaranteeing that it would flop. Turning the limitations on the special effects into a positive, Murch brews a foreboding fantasy atmosphere heading towards Gothic Horror in haunting wide,circling shots going down the ruined Yellow Brick Road to the decayed, crumbling land of OZ.Joined by cinematographers David Watkin & Freddie Francis as Disney revealed that the original outdoor locations picked for filming were to be dumped, in order for it to be only shot on soundstages and backlots. Murch and the cinematographers impressively give OZ an expansive appearance from the first long tracking shot taking Dorothy out of a mental ward and into a OZ with a sparkling, sharp glass castle ruled by Mombi, reflecting the former heads of OZ which she has destroyed.Later saying that his goal was for the title to not be seen as a direct sequel, but rather a partial one,that was closer to the spirit of L. Frank Baum's second and third OZ novels, the screenplay by Murch and Gill Dennis retains the quiet heroism of Dorothy,and the warming friendship that bonds misfits Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead and Dorothy together, whilst taking the sense of wonder from fantasy,into the mesmerising realm of Horror.The writers descend OZ into a wasteland state,from the howling arrival of the Wheelers spinning the group to the Gothic Horror headless vision of Mombi and the stone fist of the Nome King, all of which thrillingly heightens the passion the gang share to get OZ from out of the darkness.Being the lone cast member of the heroes who is human/ does not have practical effects covering her face,Fairuza Balk gives a remarkable feature film debut performance as Dorothy, with Balk at just 10 years old skilfully expressing love and compassion for Tik-Tok, horrified glances at Mombi, (played with glee by Jean Marsh) and a determination to make a return to OZ.",Return to Oz
12,Aaron1375,"Wow, that was a lot more enjoyable to watch as an adult.",8,18 December 2019,"I first saw this film back when I was a kid and I was not all that wild about it. I guess my mind could not grasp the idea of an Oz movie that was faithful to the book and was confusing because it did not seem like it was part of the original film's world. Now that I am an adult, I really dig this one more than the original 1939 film as it is darker to the point of being almost a horror/fantasy film and there are not a bunch of chirpy songs coming from nowhere. Honestly, the original was essentially a Broadway stage play that was filmed. This one, however, was more like the Oz portrayed in the books.The story has poor Dorthy suffering from sleepless nights due to her adventures in Oz. Her aunt's solution? Why, take her to a doctor that using electroshock therapy of course! Well, Dorthy ends up in a creepy asylum and is about to be zapped when the power goes off, another girl frees Dorthy and both she and the other girl end up falling into a river just outside the asylum during a very violent storm. The other girl seemingly drowns as the river somehow transports Dorthy back to Oz; however, it is now run down and full of strange beings known as Wheelers who promptly give chase. Dorthy manages to find her way into a room and enlists the aid of Tic-toc, a wind up soldier. She will also find help from Jack Pumpkinhead and meet her old friend Scarecrow too. However, a strange demented Princess named Mombi and the Nome King will do everything in their power to stop Dorthy from returning Oz to its former glory!Watching this film, one gets more of a sense of what Oz is all about, it is a mirror world where there are people from our world living within it. I get the feeling Stephen King and Peter Straub used the Oz series as inspiration for their collaboration, The Talisman as it too features a parallel world. While I found this one good as an adult I also found at times the outside world of Oz too mundane, though the interiors do look fantastical. It is a shame this bombed at the box office, because this Oz is so much more delightful and frightful than the 1939 version.So, in the eyes of an adult, this movie actually improved for me. Usually, you watch stuff as a kid and later as an adult and like the film less, but not here. It is a strange world that is put together by Disney, who were going through bit of a dark phase during this time. They were also going through a rather rough time as there just were not too many hits during this era in their history. Not that the films were not good, just not what people expected from a Disney film at the time. This one is one such case, really good, but people expected lighter fare and something more in the line with the 1939 film.",Return to Oz
13,zetes,Really good,8,20 March 2011,"Distant sequel to the Wizard of Oz made by Disney in the '80s. It was a bomb at the time, but over the years it has been revived as something of a cult favorite children's film. It's not hard to see why. It's one of those children's films that's kind of too frightening for children. Compared to the 1939 film, it's a true nightmare. Those Wheeler guys, the witch who can exchange heads, and the Nome King are all intensely creepy (I guess the flying monkeys from the original are pretty freaky, too, but, even as a child, the Wicked Witch of the West looked like nothing more than a stern teacher to me). The story is very much the same structure from the original, with Dorothy (Fairuza Balk, who would later go on to co-star in films such as Almost Famous and American History X) collecting friends suspiciously similar to the first one while trying to discover what happened to the Emerald City and her friends (the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man were turned to stone, but the Scarecrow is nowhere to be found). Despite the similarities between the two films, Return to Oz really succeeds in being a worthy sequel while completely differentiating itself from the original. It, too, has some beautiful production design and a gorgeous musical score (no songs, though), and as a fantasy movie, it's as good as anything else made in the '80s. I didn't appreciate it as a child, mostly because it was so different from the original, which I loved (and still love), but I can very much appreciate its wonder as an adult.",Return to Oz
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A wonderful film, I'll always return to Oz",7,27 January 2004,"Honestly I do not know how I am this sane because when I think of my childhood, one of my favorite movies was Return to Oz. I absolutely adored this movie, but it scared the heck out of me. I was shopping and found Return to Oz on DVD and without hesitation bought it, it's always nice to go down nostalgia lane and I was thinking maybe since I was a kid I was just easily scared by silly things, nope, I was so wrong. This is a major mind screw of a movie. However, I cannot believe that I still adore this movie, I love the risks it took and that it didn't insult children's intelligence like most movies do. Don Bluth, one of the greatest animators and story tellers of our time, said that kids are more resilient than you would think. That's so true and Return to Oz is a wonderful magical movie that leaves you breathless.Dorothy Gale has become a melancholic child who cannot stop dreaming of the people she met in the magical world of Oz, concerning Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. The two decide to take her to see Doctor Worley, known for his shock therapy treatments. Before going, Dorothy finds a key she believes her friends from Oz sent to her on a shooting star. Aunt Em leaves Dorothy at Dr. Worley's laboratory under the care of Nurse Wilson. As she is taken to have treatment, the lab has a blackout, and Dorothy is saved by a mysterious girl who reveals that some patients have been driven insane by Worley's treatment. The two escape but fall into a river. The blonde girl vanishes underwater and Dorothy returns to Oz. Upon awakening, Dorothy finds her chicken who can now talk named Billina for company. The two discover the ruined Yellow Brick Road, which leads them to the Emerald City, now in ruins, missing its emeralds, and all of its citizens including the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion turned to stone. She swears that she will restore Oz with the help of some new friends while being chased by some disturbing new villains.I remember as a kid being terrified by Princess Mumbi, she has this room full of heads that she can change as she pleases and when Dorothy has to go to retrieve a potion from her cabinet with the ""main head"" she accidentally knocks over a jar and the head screams ""Dorothy Gail!!!"" and all the other heads start screaming! God, that scene is still horrifying to watch! But there is an extremely touching scene that always gets me in tears, Jack Pumpkinhead who Dorothy meets asks her if he could call her mom until he finds his real mother, she agrees with a kind heart and as they are laying on their flying couch called The Gump, he puts a scarf on her and says ""good night, mom"". I loved their relationship, it was beautiful. Also she has a great relationship with Tik Tok, a robot who was part of the Army of Oz and has to be wound up in order to work, his personality fits so extremely well with the group since you have the silliness, you need the intelligence too. The effects are still outstanding to this day in my opinion, the acting is very good, the sets, the lighting, the costumes, the characters, I just love Return to Oz. It's a great movie. Parents today are so afraid of showing their children movies like Return to Oz because it might give them nightmares, take advice from me and Mr. Bluth, your kids are a lot stronger than you think, and I'm perfectly fine and I'm so glad I have this movie in my collection. It's a wonderful film not to be missed.10/10",Return to Oz

She escapes, and somehow ends up back in Oz! But everything is changed. Her friends have all turned to stone, and now the evil Mombi is in charge. With help from pumpkinhead and Tiktok, Dorothy must steal the magic powder and bring her friends back to life. It's pretty wacky, with tim burton-like characters. Lots of science defying things that fly. It's clearly aimed at a younger audience, but the (strange) story line and mismatched characters kind of works. All very random. The whole premise of returning to Oz later, and finding it decrepit and in dis-repair is kind of fun. Directed by Walter Murch. This is one of the two projects he has directed; the other was a television episode. He seems to have done mostly sound and editing, winning Three oscars!",Return to Oz
16,lost-in-limbo,"""Why don't we just fly back to Kansas.""",7,7 July 2012,"Surprisingly I never knew that the late 1930s feature ""The Wizard of Oz"" had a belated, if daring sequel which was made by Disney in the mid- eighties until recently. What got me more interested was hearing that it was much darker, strange and brooding in tone, if still keeping in that imaginative spin and being faithful to its sources. After watching it, I'm kind of caught somewhere in between. It's a hard one to figure out. I loved the dark approach and melancholy vibe which surrounded every scene, even those moments before Dorothy finds herself in Oz. Like those dreary sequences on the farm or in the mental hospital. The cast attached are sensational; Fairuza Balk evokes the spirit as Dorothy. Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh are memorable in their dual villainous roles. Piper Laurie and Matt Clark are fine-tuned as Dorothy's Aunt and uncle. Nonetheless the real stars are the creations that come out of Oz. There are a bunch of new vivid characters on Dorothy's journey, even though the Scarecrow, Tin-Man and cowardly Lion do appear. They're nothing more than cameos here. The new creations; Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Gump and Billina a talking chicken (that takes over Toto) take centre stage. Impressive in details and design, especially the puppetry work and stop-motion. The world that was created was surreal and inventive with a real Gothic air, but the grounded story which was virtually one set-piece after another seemed to have a stop and go pattern where it would slow down where not much would be happening and the sense of wonder simply languishing, despite the eccentrics of the imagery's and performances. No bright, cheerful musical interludes here either. Instead it goes for thrills grim, creepy and they're effectively done. It's stylishly presented and admirably crafted  where it relishes in its wickedly warped sense. ""There's no place like home.""",Return to Oz
17,Robert_duder,"Attention...this is NOT a sequel, end of story!!",9,26 August 2005,"First off Return To Oz is classic period, one of the best films in history but in my opinion, NOT for children, young children anyways. I don't understand all the discussion and constant mention of this being a sequel to the original Wizard of Oz?? This film is made in it's own right based on a series of books which happen to be the second and third books in the series. The film makers obviously knew that everyone already knew the story of The Wizard of Oz and therefore didn't need to go back and cover that aspect of it but instead created a film after those events. There is nothing in Return to Oz that even hints at this being a sequel. Return to Oz is EVERYTHING Wizard of Oz wasn't. It's dark, very dark, creepy, no singing whatsoever, very defined different look in each Oz character. Also when Dorothy first returns to Oz she makes it known that the desert surrounding Oz is ""the deadly desert"" which she is well aware of, something that certainly was not in the original. Sure there are some similarities and recreations taken from the first. Dorothy's character except being much younger (as she was in the books), has some very similar qualities to Judy Garland's Dorothy and even seems to have some of the same mannerisms and voice tones. The ruby slippers which were created exclusively for the original film make a reappearance BUT they are such a common staple to the story now that it's necessity to have them.If this film had been released nowadays it would have been turned into some sort of multi billion dollar franchise which would be great!! One of the only downsides to this deliciously dark creation is it's too short and misses out on some great points. The young Fairuza Balk is perfect casting as Dorothy Gale. She is mentally disturbed by the events that previously happened in Oz and her family believes her to need Psychiatric treatment. Enter the terrifying Psyciatric hospital. This film begins it's dark and at times terrifying vision of psychiatry treatment with the mysterious girl who saves Dorothy. The quality of this film is to watch everything you know about Oz and return there yourself to discover the ruins and what has happened to all the familiar characters. On top of that director Walter Murch who has since this film done some incredible work, gives new characters life such as Jack Pumpkinhead, Tik Tok, The Gump, and terrifying evil doers that makes the wicked witch look like Glenda. The Nome King played by veteran actor Nicol Williamson, and more importantly the horrifically evil Mombi played by a variety of actresses depending on what head she was wearing...yes the interchangeable heads which also makes for one of the most terrifying moment in movie history when Dorothy steals the powder of life and the heads begin to scream at her. Plenty of special effects, although a little outdated and corny at times, still beautiful setting, familiar characters, good triumphing over evil...everything that makes a classic!! Just be careful about young kids because it has that dark streak. But this one is definitely worth seeing!! 9/10",Return to Oz
18,bowmanblue,A classic in its own right,7,13 October 2014,"Yes, we all know the first film - The Wizard of Oz - it was big all that time ago in 1939 and it's still as enjoyable today. Yet, somehow the long awaited (well 1985) sequel 'Return to Oz' never real set the box office alight. It could be thought that that makes it a bad film, however, that couldn't be further from the truth.It's about Dorothy (not Judy Garland, obviously) and her adventures as she's drawn back a second time to the magical land of Oz. Perhaps the main difference is the tone of the film. The 1939 epic was all blatantly filmed in a studio. It could have been a stage show, simply converted to film for all we knew, whereas the sequel is all filmed on location, automatically giving it a more realistic feel.It also drew criticism for NOT having any of the other cast members back. Yes, the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man are all in it (technically), but their screen time amounts to little more than extended cameos. Instead, we're treated to a new set of weird and wonderful helpers, who go about aiding Dorothy in her quest to defeat a new baddie (the Gnome King).Apart from the fact that it's Oz and the central character is Dorothy, there are few similarities between the two films, leaving some to wonder what sort of sequel this is.But don't be put off. It may be a different type of magical adventure, but it's still a very good one. Fairuza Balk has the difficult task of being the new Judy Garland, but she puts on a good performance as the small, vulnerable girl, lost in a much more nasty place than (the slightly older) Judy Garland had to survive in.If you're a fan of fantasy films (and of course the original) then you should enjoy this. Just don't expect the happy-go-lucky feel of Oz's predecessor. It's worth returning to Oz, just to see this.",Return to Oz
19,Cineanalyst,Dorothy Gets Shock Treatment,6,12 January 2020,"I've read L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" as well as a bit of some of the rest of the series years ago, and, for the most part, it's bland kiddie junk. (I come to this conclusion despite the best efforts of Michael Patrick Hearn's notes in ""The Annotated Wizard of Oz"" pretending it to be great literature.) In a sense, Baum was right in promoting the abandonment of a moral in writing modern fairy tales, but not entirely regarding the ""blood-curdling incidents"" from the likes of Grimm and Andersen, let alone his distaste for the complexities of Lewis Carroll's Alice books. ""Return to Oz,"" however, returns somewhat to the more frightening aspects characteristic of fairy tales of yore--not the listless sentiment and stupid humor comprising much of today's children's movies. Indeed, the works of Baum, too, are less bowdlerized than that which has followed. Finally, for instance, ""Return to Oz"" is the first film to faithfully render the author's curious fondness for decapitations (seriously, go read the books; it's there).I don't care to get too far into the territory of writing a parents' guide, but I do suspect that if one is raised on bland entertainment, they tend to grow up bland. Some protection of children from serious adult issues of the world is one thing, but extending that ignorance to stories where the witches or stone men are scarier than the usual Disney fare is another matter. For instance, IMDb's top reviewer, Martin Hafer, goes so far as to hyperbolically state that showing ""Return to Oz"" to younger kids ""would be like abuse."" As promising as that line and other reviews have made it out to be, ""Return to Oz"" isn't nearly that shocking. Yet, Dorothy does almost receive electroshock treatment after Aunt Em drops her off at the loony bin--because the poor little girl can't sleep or shut up about her recent cyclone-induced trip to the land of Oz.Appreciably, Oz, this time, is more shocking, as well. Since her last visit, Oz has become a dystopian wasteland where all her friends have been turned to stone and where, in the spirit of Baum's aforementioned obsession with head removals, a witch changes hers like they were hats. Of course, there's the Jack-o'-lantern guy, too. Hey, if the film being set during the Halloween season didn't tip you off that you're not in MGM's Kansas and Oz anymore, then it's your own fault. Nevertheless, a standard fantasy quest occupies most of the proceedings, and after Dorothy's visit to Mombi, it's quite tame. Oddly enough, too, eventually the Nome King has Dorothy and company enact a first draft of the finale of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989).Beside the Halloween-themed horror and dystopian elements, as well as some naturalistic writing for and acting by Fairuza Balk as a young Dorothy (closer to the age of Baum's character as opposed to Judy Garland and other, older variations), the other thing I appreciate about this reinterpretation of Oz is the introduction of a mirror motif. Mombi's castle is covered in them. Moreover, they take on a similar function to that in Carroll's Alice sequel, ""Through the Looking Glass,"" as a gateway, with one character being trapped in them, and suggesting Oz as being a sort of reverse-image of Kansas. Tellingly, this Dorothy doesn't just want to go home; she wishes she could be in both places at the same time.",Return to Oz
20,ericstevenson,Why is Dorothy younger?,8,11 January 2018,"It's hard to make a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time, but they actually did it pretty well here. This movie features Dorothy returning to Oz to find out that the evil Gnome King has turned the citizens of Emerald City into stone. What I love about this movie is how beautiful it looks. The costumes are simply amazing and every one of the characters looks so unique. I'm glad to see Jack Pumpkinhead in a better movie than ""Journey Back To Oz"". There were indeed references to the original film.They still made it a movie in its own right and didn't cram the references down our throats. I do wonder why the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion look different. It's hard to say that this is really an official sequel to ""The Wizard Of Oz"".

Nicol Williamson put on a very good performances and Jean Marsh as always did a good evil job! The newer characters are good. The music is very good.I've always thought that when ever the scenes come and show the Nome King's Mountain from a distance the music that plays during them is much like some of Ghostbusters. If you haven't seen the Return of Oz then see it because its a good film and yes its a classic!,Return to Oz
24,funkyfry,"Solid children's fantasy film, minimal entertainment for adults",6,18 July 2006,"On the whole, this was a good film for kids, probably very effective I think especially in terms of ""scary fantasy"". Less effective for adults compared to films like ""Time Bandits"" and the original ""Wizard of Oz"".The plot set-up is a little unconvincing, as it has Aunt Emm so upset over Dorothy's continual talk of Oz that she sends her for electroshock therapy! Dorothy and another girl escape from the sanitarium and a river whisks her away to the land of Oz again. Ruinously, she has brought an annoying chicken instead of her faithful dog Toto. Once in Oz the chicken is able to speak English through the magic of Oz, with no explanation as to why this didn't happen to Toto. She finds all her friends have been turned to stone except the scarecrow who has been abducted by the evil ""Nome King"". Her confrontation with the witch who has a collection of removable heads is probably the film's high point. The sets are incredible, basically a hall of mirrors with Victorian gold and brass embellishments that puts the original film's sets to shame. Dorothy is captured by the witch, who intends to make her an addition to her collection of heads once she's grown a bit. She manages to escape with the aid of her friends and some magic powder of life, then sets off to find the Nome King.Nicol Williamson's performance as the Nome King is interesting but nowhere near his classic turn as Merlin in ""Excalibur"". Sad to say that dude is more memorable and effective when he's completely over the top. Personally I think the scene where he was dispatched was quite a bit anti-climactic. His exit line ""eggs are poison"" is nowhere near as memorable as ""I'm melting! I'm melting! What a world, what a world!"".Fairuza Balk turns in a very competent child performance. Harder than it seems. The biggest problem I had was with the chicken, which was only marginally less annoying than Jar Jar Binks. I can't remember a time in my childhood where a character like that would actually be endearing. Denise Bryer's voice is totally inappropriate and grating, and her Midwest/southern accent is very unconvincing. The animatronics are good on the chicken, and indeed all the puppets in the film are very well done. The effects in general have held up well. The Nome King is mostly done with stop motion though there are some scenes with Williamson with a lot of makeup on, looks like a real pain to put on. Tic-Toc is a particularly convincing puppet. The mattes are a bit too elaborate to be fully convincing.On the whole a pleasing fantasy film that presents only mildly annoying elements for adults and a lot of good dark fantasy elements that will appeal to both kids and adults. May disappoint fans of the original as there is no singing and dancing here and we see very little of the original group of Dorothy's friends. The film also strays pretty far from Baum's mythos, including use of the device where the elements she comes across in Oz are reflections of people or places she's been in Kansas. This was not an element in Baum's stories but seems to have been imported here to stay closer to the 39 version. I think this film will excite the young, might be scary for very young kids, but the effects are still good enough to pass grade and the film may even inspire some kids to pick up some of Baum's books after they finish with old Harry Potter.",Return to Oz
25,Vartiainen,Dark and twisted take on a beloved classic,7,1 August 2021,"Return to Oz is a 1985 film that works as an unofficial sequel to the worldwide classic, the 1939 The Wizard of Oz. We once more meet Dorothy, played this time by Fairuza Balk because Judy Garland at the esteemed age of 63 would have been a bit too old to reprise her role. Plus she had already died in 1969.This time around Dorothy finds her way back to the Land of Oz after her parents try to have her treated at a mental institution. She does keep insisting that she visited a magical realm where she made a scarecrow king of the little people after having melted a wicked witch by throwing water on her. You can't exactly blame the parents for their decision.Anyway, Oz is once again suffering under the yoke of a distant magic user, but this time the mood is decidedly more grim than last time. This is a dark, often downright scary film. Exactly the kind of twisted trip into madness that 80s children's films are known for.And I like it a lot. It's not quite the classic the original was, but it has a clear identity, the sets and character designs are great and it works as its own story, while still feeling like a spiritual successor to the original.Heartily recommended if you're a fan of those dark 80s fantasy films.",Return to Oz
26,gwnightscream,"""Bizarre, Underrated 80's Fantasy!""",6,6 December 2015,"Fairuza Balk, Piper Laurie, Matt Clark, Jean Marsh and Nicol Williamson star in this 1985 fantasy based on L.

This is sort of a follow-up to the 1939 classic, ""The Wizard of Oz"" and Balk (The Craft) fills the role of the late, Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale who is back in Kansas and can't stop forgetting about her recent trip to the magical land of Oz. Laurie (Carrie) plays her Aunt Em who decides to get her medical care. Soon, Dorothy finds herself back in Oz after a mysterious girl (Emma Ridley) helps her escape shock treatment. Dorothy meets new friends and reunites with old ones while trying to stop an evil witch, Mombi (Marsh) and Nome King (Williamson) from destroying it. Marsh (Willow) also plays Nurse Wilson, Williamson (Spawn) also plays Dr. Worley and Clark (Back to the Future III) plays Uncle Henry.

27,GOWBTW,Nothing like a new classic!,8,25 January 2006,"Though this movie never picked up where Dorothy(Fairuza Balk) left off, this movie seemingly tries to be the update version of the original. Far scarier than the original movie in 1939, the new characters in Oz like Tik-Tok, Jack Pumkinhead, Mombi(Jean Marsh), and the Wheelers. They didn't show the Munchkins, and Dorothy's original friends The Tin Woodsman, and The Cowardly Lion have turned to stone. And to me, The Wheelers replaced the Flying Monkeys which makes this movie a classic of its own. The funny parts in the movie is when Tik-Tok took out the Wheelers, and Jack Pumkinhead's head lands upside down, and he asks, ""Why are you standing on your heads?"" And that character Mombi, she has more heads than Albert Eistein. That's what makes her a dangerous character. I enjoyed every bit of this movie, it was different, original, and definitely not a sequel to the first. Otherwise, it would be a no-brainer. Hard to rent, easy to buy, it's a neo-classic for all ages. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.",Return to Oz

But if you're unfamiliar with the books then you'll be lost in the shuffle.  This film and the books are quite dark and bizarre. So be prepared for some heavy handed material.

And this is a Disney movie?When she finally arrives back in Oz, she is threatened by creatures that are scarier than the average horror movie villain! I was actually scared watching this Disney family flick.Crazy.Even some of the creatures that are on Dorothy's side seem to don't seem entirely on the side of good. The ""pumpkinhead"" character, for example, has the ghastly face of a jack-o-lantern, and his mouth doesn't move when he talks, giving a strange, otherworldly quality the filmmakers seem to be deliberately suggesting, like maybe he's not actually talking, maybe it's all......in Dorothy's head?This is a decidedly family UN-friendly take on ""The Wizard of Oz"". How many people, even watching the original classic today, would even come away thinking it's about mental illness?Either way, I really like ""Return to Oz"".

If I were to release Return to Casablanca, set in an east African nightspot, with Rick Blaine pining over the girl he chased away, I can claim it's unrelated all I like but the comparisons will still be made. Dorothy's return to the world of her imagination is similar in subject matter, with constant references to the MGM classic and cameos by all of the original characters, but feels much more twisted and sinister in tone. Not that the first Oz was lacking in terrifying material - the flying monkeys alone must have fueled millions of nightmares - but those moments were balanced by an optimistic, sing-songy spirit and bright outlook on life. This is more like something from the depths of Tim Burton's catalog, minus the off-kilter conscience. Strange, dark and eerie, it compensates for the lack of a clear purpose by overloading the audience with weirdness. A real head-scratcher.",Return to Oz
31,XweAponX,How OZ should have been done the first time,10,16 April 2018,"This film shows more of what OZ really was, or is, if you believe an alternate universes. It's a mirror of our own world. And we can exist there and here at the same time, all we need is a pair of ruby slippers and a counterpart who lives in a mirror. I rented this on a beta tape and watched it with my mom after it had finished its original theatrical run. We both liked it, but without the widescreen format and a theatrical sound system, it lost some of its ability to overwhelm us. But we still enjoyed it, quite a bit. I wish my mother were here now that I have a 50"" HDTV and a halfway decent DVD copy, and a Kenwood surround sound system. I can sit in the middle and it is just as if I am sitting in a seat in a theater because that's where this needs to be watched. Because when I watched it last night, I was completely overwhelmed by this amazing movie. The ""Kansas"" scenes are very dismal, not sure where they were filmed actually although I know some of this was filmed in London. But the landscapes looked very much like a dismal Kansas late fall prior to the turn of the 20th century. Nicol Williamson represents a type of ""doctor""/quack that dangerously fiddled around with electronic devices before people really understood how electricity worked, and his Oz mirror alternate is none other but the Gnome King himself . Joan Marsh was his nasty looking nurse (and Mombi). Piper Laurie is Auntie M and Matt Clark is Uncle Henry. But the breakaway performance in this film is Fairuza Balk who really captures the spirit of Dorothy as laid down by Judy Garland. The DVD which I found has a very good interview with Fairuza where she talks about being one of 1000 girls that they interviewed for this part, of all the kids that they looked at she was the most perfect for this. Although this film does not have musical numbers, it does have animatronics by Brian Henson and I didn't know it at the time but claymation by none other than Will Vinton, who put life into the Gnome King in such a frightening way.  Some other reviewer said this, but this is actually a horror movie, the last we saw Oz before Dorothy went home it was not like this Oz. This is apparently six months after that and something very bad has happened and it is up to Dorothy, her chicken, and the Royal army of Oz ""Tic Toc"" to find out what is going on.
 
 And there is also a mysterious girl who shows up in mirrors, that gives Dorothy a helping hand now and then: Who is this? This movie could have and should have been made long ago, shortly after the original had been made. But if it had been, there's a high probability it could not have been done as well as this. And somebody else also said this is not a sequel to the original, but it is a continuation of that same story. Most importantly, it reveals characters that were part of the Oz stories that were not mentioned in the first film. Bellini, Tic-Toc, Ozma, Mombi. Maybe in another 20 years they can continue the story. It could happen, and it should happen.",Return to Oz
32,r96sk,Didn't enjoy,6,16 September 2020,"'Return to Oz' is alright, I personally didn't enjoy it though.I did like the horror edge it has to it for the first portion of the film, it's something I wasn't necessarily expecting so it was pleasing to see. That's about all I did rate from this though, with Oz itself not looking as magical as it should while the non-human characters are boring to me.Talking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.It's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was. I get why they don't feature more, given the source material, but it feels a needless change-up especially with Billina, Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead being so lame.I read that this is apparently true to the original book series, which is respectable. However, the point of a film is to make it a good film first and foremost - this doesn't quite do that in my opinion. Each to their own, of course!",Return to Oz
33,dwpollar,Not very entertaining attempt to return to the magical land of Oz...,4,17 February 2013,"1st watched 2/15/2013 -- 4 out of 10(Dir-Walter Murch): Not very entertaining attempt to return to the magical land of Oz done by the Disney folk with Fairuza Balk as Dorothy and a mishmash of mechanical-like characters as her counterparts. The story starts 6 months after the original movie's tornado in Kansas with Aunt Em having a devastated farm-house and Dorothy babbling about her time in Oz. Em sends her to a psychiatric hospital and as she's about to get shock treatment when the electricity goes out and Dorothy escapes with a friend's help and wakes up in Oz. Oz has been devastated as well with a broken up yellow brick road and an Emerald city that has turned into stone. What we find out is that a rock-like Gnome king has taken over the land with an evil princess and wheelers that kind of replace the flying monkeys as the enemies in the piece. Technically the movie has an interesting mix of claymation and costumes, but the real downside is that the movie is just not that entertaining which causes the viewer to lose interest about halfway thru. Fairuza is fine as Dorothy, but the supporting characters are just not that appealing. These include Tic-Toc(a mechanical man), Jack the pumpkin-headed man, a talking chicken named Malena, and a moose-head with a sofa attached that comes alive and flies everyone around. Jack has the most possibilities but we never really care for these characters that much. The movie is similar in that characters from Kansas have their counterparts in the land of Oz(which was done well), but I guess I understand why Disney didn't promote this movie that much after watching it. It is much less than what it could have been. It is an interesting addition to the Oz cannon at the most and that's about it.",Return to Oz
34,ptb-8,"Yep, dark and disturbing",9,19 August 2005,"After reading about 40 of the other comments here, all of whom say RETURN TO OZ is dark and disturbing, I will make a different comment. In the early 80s Disney certainly were off the cash trail with a range of films, each expertly produced, that were box office disasters. One may recall SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES, TRON, THE BLACK CAULDRON, ONE MAGIC Christmas and a few others that had much to offer any thinking crowd,and each had special effects that were quite astonishing. Disney were in a very bleak period and the films, attempting to reflect perhaps a more mature or even grown up perspective chose, oh dear I have to say it: a dark and disturbing theme. At the time of release every critic bleated at the grim and melancholy tone of RETURN TO OZ, and sadly themselves neglected to celebrate the original book look, a choice Disney execs applauded themselves for. One Exec infamously said to us theatre owners: ""We're going for the Frank L Baum book illustrations and nothing like that 1939 vaudeville thing"". Oh dear, I thought at the time. You mean the world's most popular kids film? Well. $27 million dollars later in production costs returned maybe a quarter in theatre film rentals and RETURN TO OZ for all its merit and lavish production care and superb scary special effects....was consigned to the Disney dud bin. At the time I was irritated by the fixed goony expressions on Jack Pumpkinhead and the Scarecrow (loved Tik-tok, though, a fascinating and completely compelling design and movement piece) This time around I didn't mind it and actually appreciated the fact that they were 'book' expressions. Viewed 20 years later on a Disney DVD of dubious quality, I have to say it is a film more suited to these dark and disturbing times and if released today would certainly get a better reception and better crits...and possibly make a lot of money. I think the world is tuned into this type of family film more now than in the Flashdance 80s. The production values of RETURN TO OZ are simply breathtaking. Scene after scene perfectly realised: the green walled horror of the psychiatric asylum in reel one, the amazing claymation of the Gnome King, and especially the glittering halls of Mombi's castle. One genuinely screamworthy scene in the hall of Heads with a headless Queen rushing about in a nightmarish vision is almost only for adults, so intense is it's genuine horror. The glittering climax of a restored Emerald City is a triumph of green and silver/gold set design, I defy any viewer not to rewind it several times just to see each and every part. Yes nominated for 5 Oscars, it won none and vanished for 20 years. The no-marquee name Fairuza Balk didn't help the public embrace, no matter how exquisite she is. At least she wasn't named Soleil Moon Fry. In the same class as The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth, RETURN TO OZ now deserves its place there as part of a trilogy of superbly crafted fantasy for smart kids and astonished adults. That 'vaudeville thing' it certainly isn't. But not a failure either. The DVD is lacking trailers and production material that should and could be included. Bad Disney! Good film! I also defy any viewer not to shriek with laughter at the Gnome King revealing he is wearing the ruby slippers, a sly joke well presented.",Return to Oz

This movie certainly earns its reputation; there are things in here that would've terrified me to tears if I would've saw this as a five year old, but this film doesn't not get nearly enough credit. While it does have trouble finding a real target audience, it's one of the most imaginative sequels I've seen, and it has some of the most original characters and interesting effects I've seen in an eighties fantasy film.

37,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A Darker, Edgier Oz, ""Return to Oz"" is a Great 80's Fantasy that has sadly been forgotten...",9,2 February 2012,"Walter Murch's 1985 Disney release ""Return to Oz"" is a relatively unknown film. I was born three years after its release, but remember vividly watching a VHS copy that my my sister taped off of TV. It was a striking film, haunting and joyful. In the same spirit as other 80's fantasy (""The Dark Crystal"", ""Neverending Story"", etc), it was a dark ride. When I saw it on DVD last year, I had to grab it! While it is not an official sequel to the classic Judy Garland film, it could be viewed that way, or as a stand-alone film. It opens a few months after Dorothy returns from Oz. Missing her friends, and unable to sleep, Aunt Em takes her to Dr. Worley, who plans on using the latest therapy (electro-shock) to cure her of what he believes are delusions and dreams. However, another patient of Worley helps Dorothy escape, and she is swept up in a river, passing out. She awakens back in Oz, with her pet chicken Belina (Toto remained behind in Kansas), to discover that Oz is in ruins. The yellow brick road is faded and tattered, the Emerald City has been ransacked, and everyone in the kingdom has been turned to stone. Worse, strange demonic creatures called ""Wheelers"" live there now, under the control of the evil witch Mombi and the dreaded Nome King. Dorothy must team up with new friends (including the clockwork solider Tick-Tock, the kind-hearted Jack Pumpkinhead, and the strange being called the ""Gump"") to stop Mombi and the Nome King, and restore Oz to its past glory.The film is quite a departure from the colorful, joyful Oz we are all used to. The film has an unrelenting sense of dread and melancholy that will initially shock you. But there is also a great deal of creativity to the film, and it does lighten up towards the end. Like I said, this is very much an 80's fantasy movie, back when family films were dark, edgy and sometimes downright tragic. It is for a specific audience, and may not be appropriate for all children.From an aesthetic standpoint, the film is very remarkable. Murch's direction is phenomenal (it's too bad he never directed another film), the set design is truly eerie, the creature design is frightening and effective. It's all so perfect for the dark tone. The musical score by David Shire is completely beautiful, in addition, and covers a lot of emotions- the music will bring a tear to your eye, I guarantee it.The acting is also very strong. Fairuza Baulk makes an excellent Dorothy, and at times, seems to channel the innocence of Judy Garland. The voice actors who provide the character to her new friends (particularly Brian Henson as Jack Pumpkinhead) are a lot of fun, and Jean Marsh as Mombi is terrifying.There are some problems with the film, though. Despite being longer than the 30's version, it felt like less was accomplished. It does drag, and Dorothy and her friends don't go to many places. It's a bit too straight forward, and could have used one or two more scenes of the gang getting into various misadventures. Also, the sense of dread may be too much for some to handle, and could turn some audiences off.But that being said, if you enjoy dark, brooding fantasies, this is a great film! I loved it as a kid, and would recommend it to any Oz fan! I give it a 9 out of 10!",Return to Oz
38,mike48128,Better than Expected : Weird yet Wonderful,8,25 January 2015,"Occasionally seen on a Disney cable channel. One of those Disney misfires that still remains flawed fun, like Tron, Black Hole, and The Black Cauldron. (By-the way, I also liked ""John Carter""--see my review) A horrible beginning. Electroshock for Dorothy in an Insane Asylum? Nobody believes that she went to Oz, so she must be crazy. She runs away, falls in the river, and emerges in Oz. (Dorothy never returned to Oz the same way twice--read the books.) In some ways, way too faithful to the series of ""Oz"" books. Strange and wonderful special effects, a lot of them fascinating mechanical and animatronic puppetry, plus a brilliant ""Hall of the Gnome King"" ""Claymation"" animation sequence. This may actually appeal more to adults than children, who I suspect had nightmares when the witch ""Mombi"" changes her head. Most of the ""sidekicks"" are more-than-odd looking, like ""Tick-Tock,"" who is a shiny tin-man-potbellied walking timepiece. The ""Wheelers"" are scary-creepy. ""Pumpkinhead"" is played by Brian Henson. Your typical scarecrow, lion and tin woodsman, look nothing like the beautifully costumed creatures in the 1939 version. Instead, they look exactly like the cartoon illustrations from the ""Oz"" books. This Oz is also a very dreary place. It is in ruins and Dorothy must somehow restore it to it's former glory. Basically, an adventure story and certainly not a musical. As she travels throughout Oz, she is always trying to find her way back home, while being chased by magical and monstrous villains. The little girl playing Dorothy is outstanding, considering the gloomy story she had to deal with. A ""dirty"" dusty Disney transfer doesn't help, either. Someday I must get to Kansas. I suspect the whole place is in ""sepia tone"" or black and white!",Return to Oz

A little late in coming, but very enjoyable.The story picks up six months after Dorothy was last in Oz and she ends up there after escaping from the hospital where she was having treatment as she can't stop thinking about Oz. She has one of her pet chickens with her this time, named Billina who can also talk. After arriving in Oz, Dorothy is shocked to see everywhere almost destroyed including the Yellow Brick Road. After reaching the ruins of the Emarald City, she learns it has been taken over by the Nome King, a giant rock man who has strange creatures called wheelers as slaves. Dorothy is kidnapped by a witch named Mombie, who wants her head. Whilst back in Oz, Dorothy makes some new friends: a clockwork soldier named Tic Toc, Jack Pumpkinhead and a moose head named Gump. When they reach the Nome King, they eventually rescue the Scarecrow and turn everybody else back to normal after they had been turned to stone. Dorothy is also reunited with the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and the Nome King is defeated at the end.Now to the cast. Dorothy is played well by Fairuza Balk, who makes a good replacement for Judy Garland and is joined by Nicol Williamson, Jean Marsh, Piper Laurie and Matt Clark.Although not as good as the first Wizard Of Oz, I enjoyed watching this movie.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.",Return to Oz

It is NOT the Oz she knows because she finds the yellow brick road is tore up. The Lion,Tin Man, and everybody else in Oz have been turned into stone, and the Emerald City is in ruins. With the help of new friends like Billina the talking Hen, Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump, Dorothy flies to the Nome King's mountain to figure out what happened to the Scarecrow and Oz. Soon, the Nome King challenges Dorothy and her new friends to a little game; Scarecrow has been turned into an ornament, and if they pick the right one, the Scarecrow will come back, but if they guess wrong, they will turn into ornaments as well.

42,gizmomogwai,"An okay fantasy story, sunk by special effects",6,24 January 2010,"My family loved the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz and we didn't know about this later one until as a kid I found a book in the local library based on it, with pictures from the movie. The book itself scared me, I definitely found it darker than the Oz I knew. This movie might have scared me more had I seen it then. I finally saw it on the Internet just now, and found it underwhelming. This can serve as a sequel to the 1939 film but it's really a separate adaptation of a public domain story.The story gets darker starting with the opening in Kansas, where we have scary science and Dorothy needing to break free. When she gets to Oz (how, I'm not sure) she finds the place in ruins, which may not be pleasant to those who remember the pretty place we saw in the 1939 classic, but it is interesting. The creepiest part may be a woman who keeps many heads, and threatens to take Dorothy's head.Still, any gripping atmosphere this movie could have had is sunk by poor special effects. This may be surprising since it came 45 years after Judy Garland's movie and the Great Depression was long gone this time, but the older movie looks better than this one. The most obvious comparison would be the Scarecrow, who looks terribly cheap here. It goes deeper than that, however. The talking rocks and ""Wheelers"" are poor effects as well. For this reason, Return to Oz won't draw you into Oz in the same way The Wizard of Oz does.",Return to Oz
43,mentalcritic,Middle Of The Road,5,20 April 2005,"Return To Oz is very much like a retread of The Wizard Of Oz, with most of the major events of one film repeated in the latter. About the only significant difference is that Return To Oz, while wearing its origins as a Disney production on its sleeve, is a little less saccharine, or sugar-coated, compared to its predecessor. Not so much that it could score ten out of ten from an older audience, but enough so that you could show it to audiences who have more than one digit in their age, and not draw protests. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily make it a good film.Whereas the cast of heroes in The Wizard Of Oz were very distinct from one another, the heroes of Return To Oz are fairly generic. The plot, such as it is, concerns itself with a Troll-like King who comes out of the stone of one mountain. Somehow, he has acquired the ruby slippers from the previous film, and used them to sack the city of Oz. The populace is found turned to stone, and the streets patrolled by Wheelers, a bunch of ugly human types who look a lot like Johnny Rotten at a roller-disco. The Wheelers are controlled by an evil princess who collects heads to wear, while she is in turn controlled by the Nome King, who I've already spoken about. The plot is very simple and by the numbers, as opposed to how every new location seemed natural or spontaneous in the original. In fact, there are only three or four major locations in Return To Oz, and most of them are passed through in the blink of an eye.Children who have yet to see The Wizard Of Oz will not notice the most major problem with this sequel. In a nutshell, it is continuity. The Dorothy shown in The Wizard Of Oz was played by Judy Garland, who was about seventeen years old at the time. Disney, in their endless attempt to pander to a child audience, decided to make Dorothy ten years old, in spite of the number of references made to six months passing since the tornado hit the Gale farm. These not-so-subtle continuity faults aside, the story is competently told, and Fairuza Balk makes a decent fist of playing the young Dorothy.Another plus in Return To Oz is that the support cast is considerably less annoying in its perpetual perkiness. Tik-Tok has more personality than the entire cast of The Wizard Of Oz put together, while Pumpkinhead manages to be dopey without seeming insulting. Something that was utterly beyond the cast of... well, you get the idea. Another plus is that we are spared the agony of the cast breaking into song every ten minutes. The only point where the film falls down is when the weight of the Disney desire to claim that they are making films suitable for everyone when in reality they are only suitable for four-year-olds becomes too much for the screenplay and actors to deal with. Quite obviously, this sequel was churned out in order to make a quick buck, as the minor flood of spin-offs of the time showed. Still, it gets a little closer to the tone of L. Frank Baum's novel, and that can only be a good thing.All in all, I gave Return To Oz a five out of five. Unlike the ""everyone loves it, we say so"" advertising that is prevalent in trying to sell The Wizard Of Oz, Disney seem to have adopted a ""here it is, take it or leave it"" attitude to Return To Oz. Which is the biggest improvement I can think of.",Return to Oz

45,Mister-6,"Diminishing ""Return""s....",5,14 October 1999,"The main reason that ""Return to Oz"" did so badly is simple enough.People went in expecting another light-hearted, toe-tapping, bright and cheery trip down the yellow brick road.  Instead, they got a dark, creepy and sometimes scary trip akin to an ""Indiana Jones"" movie.All that was missing was Dorothy (Balk) wearing one of Indy's fedoras.This is clearly not a children's film, and any parent who lets an impressionable young child watch this film should have his head examined! This is more of a special FX maker's film, with great and loving detail to all the effects paramount in the story, secondary to any consideration towards the actual plot.There are ingenious characters here, more familiar to those familiar with Baum's books.  But even for 1985, they're impressive.  And the final showdown with the Nome King was extremely well done.  All in all, it depends on how you go into this one as to whether you'll appreciate it.  Don't go in expecting Judy Garland, dancing scarecrows and dazzling Technicolor and you may just be entertained.  If you still believe in rainbows, though....Five stars, for the FX.

46,Hollywood_Yoda,"A Friendly Follow Up to 1939s ""The Wizard of Oz""",9,6 April 2013,"""Return to Oz"" was the Disney Company's first attempt at a sequel or prequel to the classic 1939 film, ""The Wizard of Oz."" It resembles nothing of the MGM classic and is almost no comparison in regards to achievement or style. Nonetheless the film has been endured as a family-friendly version of Oz and has achieved cult status. ""Return to Oz"" is the black sheep of the Oz film family in this writer's eyes.In honor of Roger Ebert, who passed earlier this week, I would give this film one thumbs up, as it sparked my interest enough to watch it, but not enough to take it seriously after seeing the 1939 classic it is a sequel of. It has a hint of Disney magic, but nothing full flair like many Disney adaptations today, such as ""The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian"" or the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. However, ""Return to Oz"" does build on a classic and that is why it is still remembered today.I was only glad to hear that Disney Corp had decided to make ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as a prequel to the 1939 classic.

This, however, did stay true to the source material by being based on L. Frank Baum's books, The Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz and had some amazing special effects which took my breath away more than once.And the disturbing way Dorothy's parents ended up leaving her which made her go to Oz because of her odd dreams of the fantasy land was maybe the most uncomfortable part of the generally bleak tone of the movie, but even though that's the case I still loved her new friends in Oz.Aside from the wonderful special effects, the ending was so heart-warming after all the bleakness and disturbing images and being in constant danger.

I finally saw it recently on the Disney Channel where I noticed it was not made to be a sequel, but a more closer recreation closer to the Frank L. Baum story with all the images and lore crammed in as far as possible and as many differences created to show the two apart. The special effects are over the top though and it tries too hard to be charming, but unlike the original film, the real world of Kansas is too harsh and nasty for little kids to appreciate. It is worthy to note that Fairuza Balk of ""The Craft"" was such an adorable and beautiful child in her youth, and quite a believable actress. I do like the scenes with the witch who chooses identities from different heads up until she ruins everything with the head of Jean Marsh; how'd she get in there ?! Dorothy's innocence is played up in several scenes and too far in others as she learns how her visit tampered with the grand scheme of things in Oz. None of the characters of the first film are given very large roles, but the visual creations are stunning and worth it to give the film a look.",Return to Oz
49,itamarscomix,Wildly Imaginative,8,26 August 2012,"Return to Oz is the kind of film that was doomed to fall between the cracks - too scary for kids (or rather, for parents), too childish for adults; the promotional material made too much of an effort to advertise it as a sequel to MGM's 1939 musical classic, doing it more damage than good; many claimed, and still do, that it was nothing but a trendy attempt to make The Wizard of Oz darker and edgier to appeal to modern audiences, and destroyed our precious childhood memories. None of them read the original books by L. Frank Baum, of course; if they did, they'd know that Return to Oz, with its dark humor and wild, nonsensical imagination, is much closer in tone to the books than the 1939 film ever was - which was, on the contrary, a much lighter and cleaner take on them.For any fan of the book, Return to Oz is a real joy. They'll easily recognize it as a combination of elements from the two first sequels to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz - The Marvelous Land of Oz (Jack Pumpkinhead, Mombi, The Gump) and Ozma of Oz (The Nome King, Tik-Tok, the Wheelers, Billina). These books aren't as globally famous as the first one, but they're just as good, some may say better; and the film did a fantastic job of adapting Baum's wittiness, imagination and knack for nonsensical dialog. The various creatures described in the text were transferred to the big screen with stop-motion, puppets and costume effects that may be out-of-date, but are so richly imaginative and stylish that it's impossible to imagine them replaced by CGI; they fit Baum's vision so well.The film, of course, needs to be measured by its own merits and not just as an adaptation of the source material; as such, some flaws must be acknowledged. Some lines in it may seem silly or cheesy to most viewers, and some scenes are so wildly nonsensical that they may end up throwing the viewer right out of the story. It may also be difficult for it to find its right audience - it may indeed be too scary for very young children, and too silly for more uptight adults. But it's a wonderful film for the young at heart, and also for slightly older children or ones with an open mind and a sense of imagination - as long as they aren't turned off by the relatively slow pace and hand-made effects, which are radically different than what modern children's movies may have accustomed them to. Return to Oz may never be everybody's cup of tea, but after bombing in the box office it thankfully got the recognition it deserved as a beloved, if somewhat obscure, cult classic.",Return to Oz

I first watched it when I was 14 years old and I seemed to be a bit impressed by it. OK, it's not as strong as the original due to it's flaws, but it's a very good sequel and a very underrated one at that.First of all, I like how the story doesn't repeat the original and it's darker tone is represented well throughout the film, but aside from it's decent character development, it does derive itself from two books of the Oz series ""Land of Oz"" and ""Ozma of Oz"". The script does have it's problems with several scenes that were completely cut.Flaws aside, everything is done perfectly. The cinematography is brilliant, the stop motion effects on the Nomes, although dated back then, are splendid, the scenery is beautiful, the costumes and make-up on the new characters including the villain Mombi, the Nome King, Jack the Pumpkinhead, and others are perfect. The direction from editor Walter Murch is solid and builds a lot of tense and atmosphere to the darker tone of the film; the music from David Shire is pretty good too. The best part goes to the cast of actors. Fairuza Balk did a fantastic job portraying a much younger Dorothy (don't get me wrong. Judy Garland's role as Dorothy was timeless), Jean Marsh is a menacing Mombi, Brian Henson is a wonderful sidekick Jack the Pumpkinhead and Nicol Williamson is a frightening Nome King.Overall, Return to Oz isn't as excellent as ""The Wizard of Oz"", but I can see why this got a cult following over the past few years and I would recommend this to those who haven't seen it.",Return to Oz

Oz especially has a naturally creepy quality to it even though people like to whitewash the experience and talk about ""how sweet"" the whole thing is. even the old 1930's Judy Garland movie gives me the creepy crawls, that's why i think it's so incredibly funny.kids movies and entertainments are surreal and very dream like and often, like dreams, give us a look at our inner longings and beliefs. Disney ""princess"" movies in particular can seem a little grandiose and deluded. sometimes i'm surprised with all the ""waxing' weirdness that goes on in kids shows, it's a wonder more kids don't grow up more demented.'Return to Oz' is a weird film. that's cool. the old movie was weird. the book was weird. the guy who told it was kind of weird. cool.",Return to Oz

58,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,4 April 2005,"In this minor dark fantasy classic, we return to Oz with Dorothy Gale who has not been able to adjust to normality since her primary adventures. Her Auntie and Uncle do not know what do to with her, and no-one believes her amazing stories. Eventually she is sent to a psychiatric hospital, and unknown to her family it is run by near-masochists who supposedly perform terrifying experiments on children. As this is above all a kids' movie, none of this is shown, but the suggestion is pretty heavy, and there are 'implements' all over the hospital. Jean Marsh plays Nurse Wilson who is relentlessly horrifying, and pursues Dorothy through the stormy night in which Dorothy escapes. Dorothy jumps into a river, and when she wakes she is in Oz with a chicken called Billina. However, after some exploring it appears that Oz has been infected with some kind of evil, and it is no longer the enchanting place it was, but is now the place of nightmares. The Emerald city and all inhabitants including the Cowardly Lion and the Tin-Man have been turned to stone. After a chase by the brilliantly memorable and scary Wheelers, Dorothy meets Tik-Tok, a mechanical man, and they try to find the Scarecrow and work out what has happened. Soon Dorothy is taken prisoner by the wicked Princess Mombi, Jean Marsh again, who is obsessed with her appearance, stealing the heads of beautiful young women. It seems that the Nome King has become immensely powerful, turning all to stone as his personal statues. The struggle to return Oz to its glory is one which will take all of Dorothy's skill and love.This film is a definite classic for kids, but beware, it is dark and has many moments which will be scary. I saw this recently, having not seen it in a few years, and although the impact has dwindled, and the faults are clear, it is still a good film although should definitely be seen at a young age. There are many things to recommend it, although fans of The Wizard of Oz my be disappointed by the lack of music and light-hearted fun. The acting is all top notch;Jean Marsh is excellent in her roles, an extremely talented actress, and Fairuza Balk is outstanding in her first role, seeming both timid and strong and giving a good account of what may be a disturbed child. The new characters are all just as good as those in the 1939 film, particularly Pumpkinhead and Tik-Tok. The effects here are also extremely good for their time, and they are still pretty good to see today. Scary moments include the Wheeler chase, the final encounter with the Nome King, and of course the infamous screaming heads scene which will likely stay in the memory of all who see it. If you have children with strong imaginations, or with an interest in reading or fantasy, then this is a film they should be shown, but if they are scared easily it may not be such a good idea.7.5",Return to Oz
59,backup-50362,Beautiful,10,16 June 2021,"I don't know what prompted me to watch this 40 years old movie in 2021 but I did, and I really enjoyed it, especially considering its age.It's a bit scary for children (watched it with my daughter) but I really appreciated the insane character and set designs, which by the way clearly influenced people like Tim Burton. You can't NOT appreciate this movie's legacy. And how could this movie not influence people?It's pretty amazing. The only downside is that it relies on viewers being familiar with the first Oz movie, which we weren't.But either way, if you have a kid that's 10 or older, or you're just curious yourself, this 1985 movie is definitely worth watching even today.Really creative and fascinating. Some practical effects even hold up today. I don't understand why this has a fairly low rating on imdb but absolutely garbage movies have high ratings. I guess because this movie was before production companies could influence this trash site with fake ratings and reviews.",Return to Oz
60,bh_tafe3,A criminally under valued and under rated classic of children's cinema,9,11 November 2009,"Make no mistake, despite the low box office and the movie being virtually forgotten in comparison to the more spectacular and prettier original, the Return to Oz is a superb piece of film making for children and, in my estimation, one of the very best movie sequels ever made.High praise? Probably and don't get me wrong, this is not a Godfather Part 2, or Empire Strikes back level triumph. But what Return to Oz is, is a highly enjoyable, fast paced and creepy adventure romp which succeeds on many levels where the original failed.As a kid I was terrified by this film. I'm just a poor boy from a working class family, we didn't have a VHS machine, but my Nan did. So we'd stay at her house and watch this movie and get absolutely scared witless by the creepy hospital where they zapped kid's brains with electricity and turned them into whaling vegetables. And the creepy Doctor, who looks a lot like that the creepy statue guy at the end of the film, and the nurse who looks just like that scary lady with the collection of heads.As an adult I can't help but get taken away in this story, an almost Gothic reboot of the original family musical with heavy undertones, an underlying sense of decadence and some truly frightening villains. And our heroes, we're they're all just lovely. All innocents. In short you like the good guys, hate the bad guys and can't help but find the whole thing a little creepy. So much more fun than the sex scenes, coarseness, and moral ambiguity of all those movies made for ""grown ups"", and no less entertaining.I was taken away on the magic carpet ride (or maybe gump ride would be more appropriate) as a five year old and it's no less magic now a quarter of a century later. Absolutely wonderful.",Return to Oz

I'm now 19 years old and I've just finished viewing its follow-up which I feel is the better of the both of them. A lot of people will disagree with me but whatever.The great thing about this film is that it combines a lot of different genres into the story. Fantasy, Mystery, Family, Adventure, Action, and even some Horror elements play awesome roles in this film. Another plus is that it isn't a musical. Sorry, but I'm not a big musical fan.Do your self a huge favor, sit down and see this movie. I promise you won't be disappointed.",Return to Oz
62,La Gremlin,An undeservedly maligned fantasy treasure,8,15 August 2001,"To truly understand and appreciate ""Return to OZ"", you've got to know two things.First off, this is NOT a follow-up to the classic MGM movie.  This can't be emphasized enough.  It is actually a synthesis of the first five or so sequels to the BOOK.  (This isn't a dig at the movie, mind you.  If you don't like it on some level or other, you can't be human.  It's just that the movie was based on the book in the respect that the characters in the movie had the same names as the characters in the book.)Secondly, L. Frank Baum's original, printed-page OZ is, quite possibly, the most messed up imaginary universe ever created.  There's a land of beings who throw their own heads at you as weapons.  There's a land of sentient vegetables who raise *people* in their gardens (think ""Motel Hell"" and you've got the idea).  To top it all off, it turns out that Dorothy's buddies are really good at killing things; in particular the dear, heartless Tin Man who bloodies up his hatchet with unsettling apathy.What I'm trying to get at here is that ""Return to OZ"" is an OZ movie that is much more faithful to the books.  Much more ""THIS is how long you have to be alive!"" than ""We represent the Lullaby League"".  I think it goes without saying that you'd be legally insane to show it to little kids, but fantasy fans, OZ enthusiasts, and fans of cult movies should hunt it down as soon as possible.By the way, please note that the old-school herky-jerky puppets and claymation monsters in this movie are scary as all get out.  Compare this to the awful remake of ""the Haunting"" with it's stupid cartoonish CGI creatures (and this isn't a dig at computer animation, but since the technique is inheritely realist, it's not scary).  There is a lesson here.",Return to Oz
63,ozthegreatat42330,This is an Oz Film That L. Frank Baum Would Have Been Proud Of,9,26 January 2007,"This is an Oz film that Lyman Frank Baum would have been proud of. The characters and setting are much closer to the style of his Oz stories told around the turn of the twentieth century. Especially the look of the psychiatric hospital and the look of the Emerald City. Unlike the Emerald City of the 1939 Musical this one is truly believable. It is to be remembered that in the original stories it was revealed that the Emerald City was only emerald if green tinted glasses were worn. The music score for this film was outstanding.This Dorothy was both physically and emotionally believable, unlike Judy Garland who was already acting like the big star she was. The fantasy here was not interrupted by big musical numbers. With respect to the great actors in the 1939 film, this story just works better. It would have been great if more of the many Oz books could have been brought to film in this tradition.",Return to Oz

That said, when I saw the movie this afternoon, I could not break myself away from it. It was that good.This was not the weepy tale I saw as a child back in the Sixties. This is a dark tale that seems to adhere more to the tone of L. Frank Baum's novels. This is definitely not for young kids. If some of the effects are dated, they would be for the 1939 film as well.But it is the story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's funny that this was Walter Murch's sole movie directorial effort, because he does a good job with what he has.

65,haterofcrap,A darker approach to the magical world created by L. Frank Baum,8,14 July 2011,"Personally, I think that the first ""Wizard of Oz"" movie was better than book in which it was inspired: Don't misunderstood me, I think the original book was charming and funny to read, but the movie with Judy Garland was incredibly beautiful and memorable, being one of the best movies ever made, despite being somewhat different to the source material.This movie was closer to the original book than the first film, being way darker and stranger than the first film. I still prefer the first movie, but this still has some of the magic of the original book and the classic film: The first part of the movie was surprisingly dark and eerie, as it were a horror film. Then, the fantasy part in Oz starts, but is still somewhat strange and creepy. I guess this was a good movie for the time it was made: I'm not a big fan of 80's movies, but this was good. However, some scenes from this movie could be way too scary for little kids. It was entertaining and worth-watching anyway.",Return to Oz
66,BrickNash,"A bonafide classic, and a criminally underrated film",10,23 January 2020,"This is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy films of the 1980s. It's also a sad case of criminal misjudgement and poor marketing by a studio that didn't know what it had.This film has nods to the 1939 MGM musical, but in reality it's a much more accurate depiction of the Frank L. Baum books, and it very much stands on its own two feet as a standalone film. Make no mistake - this is not a direct sequel to the Judy Garland classic. There are no musical numbers and no munchkins (past a mention).The production design of the movie is fantastic! Such imaginative animatronics and creature design, as well as some phenomenal stop motion for the Nomes. We get to see parts of Oz that were never mentioned in the 1939 film, and it feels like you are genuinely exploring this far away and magical land.Fariuza Balk give a genuinely wholesome performance as a much younger and more book-accurate Dorothy, and the supporting ""cast"" of wacky and instantly lovable creatures works wonderfully together.Special mention must go to Scottish actor Nicol Williamson for a stupendous performance as the Nome King. His deep and haunting voice, full of broken stops in the patterns and sumptuous inflections are just a joy to the ears, and he comes across as a genuinely terrifying foe.The defining feature of this film though is that it is dark. very dark! It's a bleak mix of pseudo-gothic, black fairytale, and most notably - steampunk. The eerie atmosphere of a destroyed and abandoned Oz is incredible, and the juxtaposition to the saccharine nature of the 1939 film just makes it all the more gripping. Moments of pure suspense like Mombi's palace, and some unsettling imagery like the deadly desert and the wheelers really make this film stand out in your mind.The fantastic score by David Shire manages to have a strong sense of adventure to the melodies, but also a hint of sadness too, and this really snares the emotions and invests you in what's happening.This remains Walter Murch's only film that he has directed, and he did so with the studio wanting to pull the plug on the project. However, he had support from big names like George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, which just shows the strength of faith that was in his talent. It's an incredible achievement and one that Murch should be proud of, although it's sad that he didn't make more films.Return to Oz is as much a bonafide classic as the Judy Garland film was. It's an amazingly immersive movie, full of wonderful visuals, and it's criminal that it never got the recognition it deserves.",Return to Oz

It is now ruled over by Princess Mombi and the Wheelers.  Now it is up to Dorothy and the new friends she meets to defeat the Nome King and restore Oz, along with discovering the mysterious girls secret.

However, I was surprised at what was in this that was actually creepy yet I still found it enjoyable despite what critics said about this. Even though this movie did give me nightmares for days (I was nine at the time I saw it) there was a magnet in this movie that had me coming back to it. The well designed sets and imaginative characters and the feel that is much closer to L. Frank Baum's works (even though I did not read them) made it more enjoyable than the original. The character that freaks me out the most? The Nome King and his Nomes. The idea of some demonic face peering at me from a wall or rock just gives me the feel of paranoia. Despite its creepy vibe, I would recommend it for the brave and adventurous (if not very young) of audiences.",Return to Oz
69,Morbius_Fitzgerald,I love this movie,10,9 October 2013,"If I was to name my absolute favourite film in a second, Return To Oz would probably be the first one to come to mind. It has great acting, a good story and the most important aspect for a family film, it appeals to kids and adults while never talking down to either group ONCE. Kids see this movie and are swept away into the magic of Oz, adults get a taste of what its like to be a kid again for a couple of hours.So what is the plot to this film? Dorothy is sent to an ""electric healer"" by Aunt Em and Uncle Henry to cure her ""dellusions of Oz"". She escapes during a storm and gets swept into the magical world of Oz. Although if you're expecting munchkins and the overall delightful background of the last movie...you'll be beyond disappointed. The Yellow Brick Road is destroyed as is the Emerald City and the citizens of Oz are all turned to stone. She meets companions such as Bellina, Tik Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead and a Gump (I'm not going to try and explain that, I don't even know how).The acting is absolutely marvelous, Fairuza Balk is who I think of whenever someone says ""Dorothy Gale"" to me because she just took that part and made it hers (which, considering the original was Judy Garland, thats not easy. Especially for an 8 year old!), Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh play threatening villains incredibly well and the voice acting fits the puppet work and claymation to a tee.The visual effects still hold up as being impressive. I find this element the one that really does pull the audience into the fantasy world that Walter Murch created. Its also Oscar nominated visual effects (why the hell didn't they win?!).Okay, this film is actually one of the darkest family films you're likely to encounter however I think it comes with the medium pretty well. Kids like being scared, otherwise, why would they go out for Halloween? In fact, I think one family film director said ""you can throw any emotions you want at kids, as long as you give them a happy ending"" and this film does have that happy ending and somehow keeps the charm of the 1939 film.Now I've glorified this film (and for me that was as easy as counting) I should name some things I didn't like about it. The film does feel short and for me, that is a problem (although if this was a 3 hour epic, I'm sure I'd still be saying that), and for one that I feel is legitimate - The Nome King's plan is revealed very abruptly. Although one major complaint is not this film's fault - I never saw this as a kid. I would have loved to have seen this back then but sadly, that time has passed and all I can do is love it as an adult...the next best thing.The major thing that really does give this film strength against the other countless crap Oz sequels is that it actually has the heart and soul of a family film. Modern family films are ""ooh, look at the great visual effects."" and everything else in terms of story and characters are unengaging and dull, the script talks to the audience as if it needs to hold its audience's hand through everything. This film just entertains and pulls the audience into an experience through the film. A lot like the original Star Wars trilogy.Overall, yes, this review might be bias due to how much I respect and love it but despite what critics who saw this film back then said, this film is an enjoyable film if you can let it sink in that ""there are Oz reboots"", you'll find something to enjoy about this film. I put a guarantee on that, THATS how much I love this film.PS. The obvious question after this is ""what did I think of the 1939 film?"" I think its a great film yet, it falls short in comparison with this.",Return to Oz
70,Stebaer4,Return to Sender,1,12 December 2006,"As the review on The cable Show of Not Necessarily the News on HBO indicates by the title of this review.Agreeably as they put it but unfortunately both the audience and critics agree of which upon the screen of which said Return to Oz & then immediately got changed to Return to Sender.But in giving any credit where it's do whatsoever?it's a good recreation of how the characters look in the Oz book series of 14 books & even admits that this movie's based on two of those books of which are Ozma of Oz and The Land of Oz and so thusly this Movie got to be a book itself sold on the shelves with those 14 Oz books of which were re-released at this time in The Summer of 1985 & no I didn't buy any of them either I'd just glanced through them on that shelf & at Christmastime of 1976 my family got the book of The Land of Oz as a gift and shortly before this we saw Journey back to Oz on TV.Shortly afterwards I saw this book as The Marvelous Land of Oz in a book turning thing in my reading class and on the back saw that it has Mombi from Journey back to Oz.Also in recalling in glancing through it it also has the Gump from Return to Oz.This more presents the Oz concept as real than as a dream sequence.Also it's in poor taste to present Dorothy as a mental patient of whom needs shock treatment only to make a narrow escape via a black out and then at that same time one of her Oz friends shows up to rescue her and take her to Oz.The true heroine of this movie was really Belina the Hen of whom laid an egg into the gnome king's mouth of which he said was poison to gnomes.This film concludes with the same actress(of whom played Mombi & The owner of The Mental Clinic) as the clinic owner being taken away in the Paddy wagon. Later Dorothy sees her friend Ozma in her bedroom mirror with her index finger in front of her mouth and Uncle Henry and Auntie Em forbidding her to talk of her Oz friends again and so she just decides to keep quiet from there and then plays outside so she's as a TV Guide review said,and in giving credit where it's due,portrayed as one cuckoo flying over the nest.While in the 1939 Classic this Dorothy both does and doesn't admit it was a dream upon her return/awakening.In this Movie They show that her house got blown away to Oz and never came back (along with their Hen,Belina)of which if it was a dream as seen in the '39 classic wouldn't have happened but when she awoke it was after the feeling of/that her house falling back from the sky after returning from Oz.While in this film they wouldn't have lost their old house and needed a new one if it was only a dream.of which in the '39 classic it was only a dream and they didn't loose their house.

This film. Who on earth conceived of the idea to have this successor Oz movie bear not the slightest resemblance to the 1939 film? Whether or not it was the sequel is not the point. The point is that it was the next one - and the next one is going to have to have some continuity with the first. This one didn't. At all. A wooden child actor playing Dorothy (behaving as if someone cast a spell on her), bizarre creatures, a ""return"" when we'd already been told it was a dream. . . Cynical. Dark. This film so tatters the Oz fabric that it's not even worth seeing as a so-bad-it's-good film.The winner. Wicked. Where Return to Oz played out in a universe away and apart from the 1939 film, the musical Wicked intersects with it - but in a way that merely waves respectfully then moves on. Though Wicked considerably re-writes assumptions we may have had about Oz's celebs and VIPs, it doesn't interfere with the logic of our original assumptions. And so it is that Wicked can co-exist in the same plane as the 1939 film.Return to Oz is a total outlier - and an unentertaining one. Not a single redeeming virtue.",Return to Oz
74,anchoreddown,fits in perfectly,10,31 December 2013,"The Wizard of Oz has been deemed to be the classic children's movie that gets played countless times for kids, and adults who appreciate the piece that is nearing it's 80th anniversary all too quickly. Fast forward to 1985. The decade of the 80s brought new technology for film, more specifically the early stages of CGI and anamotronics. Beyond that, the fantasy films of the 80s still lacked continuity with the many layers that often made the final cut look cheap, (despite that it was considered the best advances of the time). A piece like Return to Oz falls under the category of 'sci-fi and fantasy' and seemed to get lost in the shuffle of the many film pieces coming out at the time. I didn't pick up on this movie until Oz the Great And Powerful showed a documentary on The Wizard of Oz and it's involvement with Disney over the years. This is actually one of the few movies that actually got the layering effect right! I was very impressed with the clay-mation shots and the cutting away back and forth between the foreground and background parts of the stage. There aren't many notable actors who took the stage for the movie, however I did recognize western actor Matt Clark, who I remember from BTTF Part III as the bartender. Another notable piece of trivia concerning BTTF is that Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenbergen almost got the roles of Mombie and the Knome king.

76,darryl-jason,There's No Place Like Oz!,8,29 April 2015,"After reading many of the reviews already posted here, I think we can all agree that this movie RETURN TO OZ is an unofficial sequel to The Wizard Of Oz. Yes it is intended to follow on from the original 1939 classic, and one would hope to see Judy Garland once again reprise the role of Dorothy, had this unofficial sequel been made sooner and of course before Garland sadly passed (God rest her soul). Fairuza Balk however does exceptionally well as Dorothy Gale. One would wonder why, if this is a sequel, why she is younger than her original character in The Wizard Of Oz?? Surely she'd be slightly older in this one?I do like how the film has it's own intake to that completely different to the original - the chicken 'Billina' replacing the dog 'Toto'. Surely Dorothy isn't Dorothy without her dog. And a few people in these message boards think of this movie as a horror - I wouldn't say so exactly but it does have it's chilling moments - the heads in the glass cabinets and the dark dreary music during that scene... and yes ""The Wheelers!""The Cast - All in the all, the cast are great. I only wish Piper Laurie (Aunt Em) was featured more in the film. Such a wonderful actress and she was just terrific in ""Carrie"" (1976). She also co-starred in a 1988 TV movie ""Go Toward The Light"" alongside Linda Hamilton, whom I have met twice at the London Film & Comic Con. I have also met Jean Marsh (Nurse Wilson/Princess Mombi) at the conventions. I had a lovely conversation with her regarding her role in this movie and who cannot forget her role as Queen Bavmorda in ""Willow"" (1988). Quality actress. I do think she plays both roles of Nurse Wilson & Mombi very well.I wonder where the lunch-pail comes into it? And it's a shame we never see much of the Yellow Brick Road. As I've mentioned already, maybe this film isn't untended to be that close to The Wizard Of Oz. It tells it's own story in it's own way. I've grown up watching this film, and at the age of 28 now, I still love it. It was however made 1-year before I was born but I was a huge 80s child. ""Labyrinth"" (1986) is definitely my film and I shall be reviewing about that film soon enough!

77,johcafra,Not Your Grandfather's MGM Musical,6,19 July 2008,"--or your father's. Or from MGM. Or even a musical. But I list this among my few cinematic guilty pleasures, essentially for the following reasons:It hews closer to the OZ that L. Frank Baum intended in his many books. Perhaps not as close as some purists would like, but at least the effort was made and showed on-screen. Budgetary constraints doubtless necessitated the melding of plots from at least two of Baum's books and the altered though muted depiction of some characters we'd hitherto seen dancing and singing around Judy Garland.Pre-CGI FX by some folks who worked on the James Bond and Superman flicks, Muppet Labs, and the Will Vinton Studios, they of the California Raisins. A genuine treat!Always a pleasure to see Jean Marsh and Nicol Williamson. Watch his performance very closely when Dorothy Gale first meets The Nome King.David Shire's musical score is excellent.And I just dig those Wheelers. You'll wish you could be like them too.A bit of trivia: First, Walter Murch is an Oscar-winning editor and sound man. He directed precisely one feature-length film. If you want to study a feature-length film directed by an editor and sound man, this is it. If you want to compare with the works of a director who pays far more attention than industry average to editing and sound, Peter Weir's the man.The story's told that early on in the production Murch realized what he'd gotten himself into, and friends of his from his work on prior films showed up and graciously asked to help, among them George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola.And, inveterate credit-watcher that I am, one of the storyboard artists later directed The Nightmare Before Christmas and a puppeteer later directed The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, on which I've also commented as an IMDb user.In a phrase, this sequel will definitely surprise, stick to and grow on you.

78,LittleLotti,Still as good as when I was a kid!,7,31 December 2018,"Return to Oz was one of my favorite movies as a kid. My mom happened to record it on our VCR from the Disney channel and I'm so grateful she did!As all the other reviews here state, this movie is dark and creepy. I'm shocked that I watched it as a kid, because even watching it as an adult I felt uneasy. There is a foreboding sense of dread during the first 15 minutes or so, with a very bleak setting. Dorothy is in an asylum, locked in a room while it storms outside, and she can hear the ominous screeching of wheels down the corridor, as well as the tormented moans of men. It's a bit unsettling for a kid.There are a lot of creepy characters in this movie, like the maniacal masked Wheelers, whose feet and hands are replaced by wheels and that's how they get around. Or Mombi, the head hunting princess who keeps an array of living heads locked in glass cabinets. This all terrified me as a kid, but the movie is so good I still loved it. This is like a horror movie for kids, and it's still enjoyable for adults. Since I hadn't seen Return to Oz since I was about 10 or 12 I thought for sure it would be cheesy and ridiculous to me now. I'm really surprised at how much I still love it. The effects and creatures are amazing for 1985 and I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar. A lot of work went into this production and I applaud Disney for taking the risk to make a movie that was different.If you've never seen Return to Oz you'll probably be let down by all the hype, but it's worth a watch if you're into strange and unusual tales.",Return to Oz

The story is dark and unusual which makes the movie extremely interesting and in the separate dream/reality sequences you can key in one trait to the another.. linking it back what was acually real to start with... like the 'witch' in the 'dreams', being the mad doctors assistant in real life.This one comes highly recommended from me and is slightly creepy which might not be best for 'some' kids... but that is absolutly no reason to 'pan' this movie... very adventurous, fun, and not just a bunch of 'happy musicals numbers' throughout like 'The Wizard Of Oz' which so clearly tried to make a point that it might as well of just written it across the screen instead of even bothering to act it out...

(although this one is slightly better than Hook because it has a more reliable plot and a tighter pace) . There are no words to describe how well constructed this movie is . Every part of it really shines . From the imaginative direction to the impressive sets and costumes and from the professionally constructed script and dialogue to the effectively subtle performances from all the actors (live and animatronic) .I will have to tell you that I am fanatically against the screenplay changes film-makers usually conduct to a story / novel / myth / comic book / TV show when they turn it into a movie . They omit important plot elements , they mistreat important characters by underusing them , they often fail to shoot chilling scenes from the book (et al) due to lame direction and untalented SFX crew members hence not doing them justice (like the freezing super power of Sub-Zero in ""Mortal Kombat"") and generally they bastardize crucial thematic parts because of many changes in the atmosphere of the original . The ""Return to Oz"" script mixes elements from 2 books by L. Frank Baum and puts them in the blender with multiple variations and vital declinations from their roots . God forgive me but it is probably the best bastardization I have ever witnessed . If these words are coming out of my mouth then it is definitely a very successful film . I will brief you a little (slight spoilers coming) :  characters from the first book which is the direct continuation of Dorothy 's adventures where Dorothy manages to find the ruby slippers and returns to see her friends , are Jack the pumpkinhead , the reindeer-headed flying sofa and Mombie the witch (and NOT an aristocratic princess) . Jack and the reindeer were precisely the same as in the movie , animated by the powder of life . (there was also a cute wooden pony which was probably omitted because it was a silent role) . Mombie however was a rather old grey haired  wannabe witch who resembled remarkably Mim ! ( for the uninitiated Mim is Magica De Spell 's partner in the crusade of stealing the lucky dime of uncle Scrooge) . Ozma was indeed Mombie 's prisoner although she thought she was a boy in a young Jodie Foster way with dirty clothes under the name Chip ! The second book introduces us to Tic Toc who managed to drag Dorothy into the land of Oz once again . Tic Toc was indeed a golden metal robot but a bit shorter and quite thinner so he wasn 't as macho as in the film . He had more childish voice and manners , something like a juvenile version of C3PO from Star Wars . The greatest change was of course the Gnome King . Although his kingdom was under the ground of a desert he was not the ruler of stones but the king of Dwarfs (he was a nasty little Oumba Looba-like himself) . Nevertheless he had a powerful army and weapons and he tried to take over Oz. The Dwarves ' only weakness was the eggs . Oh , and Bileena was not Dorothy 's chicken but a native habitant chicken in Oz . The rescue mission was not for the Schiactro but for an unrelated prince (the Prince of Eb under the request of his beloved Princess) . Also the jewelry museum was true with the difference that the contestants had only one chance (not 3). The rest of the plot 's surprises such as the wheelers & the decapitated dancers were completely the brainchildren of Walter Murch and Gill Dennis.All in all the combination of these thematic factors was wonderful . I believe that this slightly tense adaptation is a much more successful depiction of Frank Baum 's vision of the Land of Oz . Enchanting and beautiful for the eye but with hidden dangers lurking around . Who can forget the beginning sequence where Dorothy finds Oz literally wrecked ? Everybody has been transformed into a stone statue and the roads and buildings are torn apart . The direction is flawless in giving us this absolutely successful threatening but interestingly suspenseful scene . I really cannot realize why so many libels like ""much dark"" ""too scary"" etc. This has exactly the same level of violence with classic Disney cartoons where the evil step mother curses Snow White with diabolical spells in the middle of storm with frightening thunders or where Sleeping Beauty 's charming prince struggles to save her by fighting her wicked witch godmother who is transformed into a giant dragon who spits up disastrous and dreadful fireballs . A much more twisted and snicky kids film is "" Willy Wonka "" , especially the boat scene .Anyway I don 't think Mombie 's heads or the giggling deranged wheelers can be frightening . They are graphic figures like the wicked witch of the West or the gremlins . As a matter of fact how hasn 't anyone found unsuitable and politically uncorrect the reoccurring quote of the Queen of hearts "" Off with his / her / their head ! ""  in Alice in Wonderland (which keep in mind that was written by a priest) . Not only Return to Oz is the near perfect follow-up to a well known legend , but it is also one of the best fairy tale adaptations  cinema industry has ever given us . Adequate SFX (like the petrified Emerald city or the flying sofa or the earthquake scene) , impressive sets (Mombie 's palace or the desert) and of course the unforgettable jewels museum (I have seen the film several times but this scene always thrills me) . As a stand alone fairy tale it is also great . Two scenes at the end standout as perfect examples *******Spoiler alert******** The celebration scene at the palace and the mirror-through communication between Dorothy and Ozma******** On top of that the glossy ruby slippers are still enchanting . What else can be said ? Mere cameos from the Tin man and the coward lion for the fans of the old cast combine with fine direction and script for a spectacular show . If only *****spoiler**** they didn 't spoil it with the doubts that it was all a dream ****** A classic masterpieceRETURN TO OZ                                    9.5 / 10",Return to Oz
82,Teebs2,"Enchanting? Traumatising, more like !",6,3 May 2005,"Return to Oz (1985)You can only imagine the look on the Disney execs faces when they saw the final cut of this film. Behind that colourful, cheerful Video/DVD cover or theatrical poster lies quite possibly one of the darkest films ever made intended for children. While I will always applaud filmmakers who dare to push the boundaries of the dark side to fairy tales and fantasy films in favour of sentiment and schmaltz, I have to say that this is pushing it.First time director Murch had made his name working as a film editor and pioneering sound designer in the 1970s with Coppolla and Lucas. Technically, this film is very good and only a few shots and effects betray the 1980s technology. The claymation of the Gnome king is particularly impressive, even today in the age of CGI. In most other aspects though, this film falls flat. First, unlike the original ""The Wizard of OZ"" there is not enough plot to sustain the momentum of this film's slightly longer running time. In the original film, there was actually a strong reason for Dorothy to stick together with her new friends, as each of them wanted to make the journey to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. The first view of the run-down and crumbling Oz is a good idea. Here, though we have some half-baked plot about the Scarecrow being kidnapped by the Gnome king, which just can't sustain the narrative. There are other problems...First, there are two villains of which Mombi, the Witch, is arguably much more frightening than the main villain of the film, the Gnome King, despite her secondary (unnecessary?) role in the plot. Secondly, Dorothy's new friends just aren't likable and so any empathy for these characters is diminished. Part of the charm with the characters in the original was the clearly human features of each character, here we just have some annoying and grotesque mechanical objects - the affection Dorothy feels for them seems awkward and slightly mad. And an annoying talking chicken is no match for Toto, despite it's crucial, and completely contrived, importance in the finale! Finally, the balance between darkness and light, good and evil, is completely misjudged. This film has some truly scary moments in it from the beginning. Even in Kansas, Dorothy is strapped to a stretcher and narrowly avoids electro-shock therapy. The Wheelers are a very freaky creation indeed, though the impact of their initial threatening presence is undermined by their hysterical stupidity. And let's not get started on the corridor of female heads in Mombi's palace. There are also very minor details which don't quite sit right, such as the way the grotesque Pumpkinhead insists on calling the 10 year old Dorothy ""Mom"" which is somehow unsettling. The bright, colourful finale in the restored Emerald City and the rescuing of Ozma come too little, too late when compared with the dark and ugly events which precede. And who the heck is Ozma anyway - why should we care if we don't know? There are no signs of hope or optimism in the film, unlike the original good fairy, or dare I say it, those chirpy little songs! Throughout all this Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, while not the strongest child actor, is shown to be a strong character regardless of the horrors presented to her.I personally have never read Baum's original books and I gather from various reviews and Murch's own comments that the tone of ""Return to Oz"" is closer to them, than the 1939 Technicolour musical. While I half applaud Murch for daring to go with a dark feel, let's face it Fairy Tales have to be scary in places, there are very few, wonderful or magical moments to counterbalance the threatening and grotesque atmosphere. I director such as Tim Burton may have got the tone right, but Murch's inexperience shows. As a result we have an unattractive film that is as bizarre and surreal as many adult orientated horror / fantasy films. Older viewers will probably appreciate it more for these qualities, and there are some interesting interpretations to be made. Could the crumbling of Oz signify the death of the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood studio cinema, of which the ""Wizard of Oz"" is a landmark. Younger viewers, however, are likely to be more traumatised than enchanted! 6/10",Return to Oz
83,CalvinValjean,"As Walter Murch Said: ""I Like To Think of It As a Sequel To One Side.""",10,18 September 2009,"If you're reading this, you already know about this movie, so I won't waste time telling you what it is, how dark/somber it is, how it isn't for everyone, how some Wizard of Oz fans hate it, how unique its backstory was, how its director never made a single other film, or how strange it is to see electric shock treatment in a film with a talking chicken. All I will say is that I simply adore it.-I love the haunting look on Fairuza's face as the camera pans to her in the opening shot, and the heartfelt gravity in Piper Laurie's voice when she says ""It's past one in the morning."" -I love the way mirrors are a reoccurring symbol throughout the film. -I love the strange sadness I feel as Fairuza speaks solemnly to the adults that tower over her. -I love the moment of hesitation Aunt Em shows before she leaves Dorothy at the clinic, and doesn't even turn around. -I love when Dr. Worley asks Dorothy how she's doing, and she responds ""I wish I wasn't tied down."" -I love when Dorothy and Billina first arrive in the Deadly Desert, and as she balances her way on the giant boulders, a claymation eye on the rock pops open. -I love when she pulls down the lunch pail, the reaction of the strange face floating on the rock, and the face reporting the news to unseen Nome King. -I love the fun turn-of-the-century music playing during this whole sequence. -I love the moment when, trapped by the Wheelers, Dorothy finds Tik Tok, and the wonderful moment they share. -I love the moment when Mombi first removes her head. -I love that wonderful/creepy Neil Gaiman/Coraline moment when Dorothy reaches for the Powder of Life and wakes up the disembodied head that screams her name. -I love the flight of the Gump, the feeling of escape, David Shire's wondrous score, and that moment when Dorothy says ""I'm awfully sleepy, but I'm glad I have my own head to be sleepy with."" -I love how in that moment when Dorothy cries in the Nome King's lap, in a cold stone hall that seems like it must be infinitely lonely, he pats her shoulder, and strangely, cries himself. Are these crocodile tears? Does he have some second personality that does care? We'll never know. -I love the scene when Dorothy eats the rock cakes and melted silver, the gravity in her voice when, talking about Jack, says with little hope ""Maybe he'll be lucky,"" and the intimate moment she shares with Tik Tok as she winds his thinking. -I love the creepy bewilderment felt in the ornament room, Tik Tok's green tears, and the moment she hugs him. -I love the restoration of Oz, when she tells the crowd they're the best friends anyone could have, and when they say they understand, I love the pure heartbreak in her voice as she asks ""Do you?"" -I love and feel infinitely sad for Dorothy as she rushes to say goodbye to her friends, not able to fully do so as the screen turns white, then we see shots of the clouds, and finally the camera pulls back on Fairuza's gorgeous eye, already open, as her voice, filled with melancholy, murmurs a quiet ""Goodbye."" -Finally, I love the final scene, as Dorothy sees Ozma in the mirror, her reflection, so she can finally live in both worlds, and finally she runs outside with Toto, and David Shire's score reaches its crescendo.This is how Return To Oz has touched me, and why it will always be one of my favorite films.",Return to Oz
84,flyingamon,It's way darker than the original but still really good,8,13 April 2011,"Although this is a sequel to The Wizard of Oz it is in no way comparable to the movie with Judy Garland (1939). This version has with Fairuza Balk a Dorothy that has the right age. Her performance is really top notch. This movie has no happy songs at all and comes close to being a thriller. However I still think it is suitable for children as it never gets bloody or gory. The scene with the witch with all the changeable heads is scary at first but really well done and becomes quite funny. Although none of the original protagonists (except for Dorothy) play a major role in this movie, their substitutes are just as good. It does have a stronger and more suspenseful plot than the original but I cannot say that I enjoyed one more than the other as I love both. So I give both movies the same rating.",Return to Oz
85,pearceduncan,Brilliantly dark kids' film,10,22 February 2003,"Return to Oz is a great children's movie with a dark sensibility, to the point of being basically a horror movie for kids. Of more recent children's movies, only Babe: Pig in the City comes close to being this dark. Some people might have a problem with this - and both these movies were commercial failures - but I loved spooky things as a kid, and neither of these two movies are scarier than some early Disney movies like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Sleeping Beauty, or indeed The Wizard of Oz.Fairuza Balk is great as Dorothy, with just the right mix of wide-eyed innocence and slightly grown-up-ness. It's no surprise she grew up to be a great, quirky actor. Most of the best roles are taken up by the various bizarre Oz creatures, many of which have a very Jim Henson feel to them; when Brian Henson turns up as Jack Pumpkinhead, it feels very natural.It's probably too intense for some kids, but many will love it. You'll know within the first ten minutes if they can take it or not!",Return to Oz
86,jre-5,What exactly is this movie?,8,23 January 2021,"Though it's considered to be a sequel to the Wizard Of Oz, it really cannot be classified as such.It's a rather unique movie with a moderately good plot, and lots of amazing special effects that I would consider to be rather impressive for their time. It has a rather intriguing feel to it that's sort of difficult to describe.But what exactly is it? It is not a true sequel for numerous reasons, not the least of which is that the overall style and feel is so different from the first movie that there's really no comparison. The Wizard Of Oz had a rather bright, fantasy feel to it, whereas this movie looks more realistic and has a significantly darker and more eerie feel to it. Though there's no blood, and very little violence, some of the movie is a bit scary and disturbing. Some of it is what I would almost describe as being ""nightmarish"" in terms of how it feels. It's certainly not a horror film, but it's more along those lines than you may expect for a movie like this. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I actually saw this before the Wizard Of Oz, when I was quite young and liked it. My point is simply that they're totally different. And for that matter, though Dorothy looks relatively similar, virtually nothing else does, not even the costumed characters. There are also some things that don't line up, like the ""Deadly Desert"" which Dorothy seems to know about, even though there was nothing even remotely like this in the first movie.So what is this movie? It's not a sequel to the Wizard Of Oz, and it's certainly not a remake. I would describe it as being a ""sequel to a remake"" (a remake that was never made).",Return to Oz
87,GayBoi1,Not a sequel to the 1939 movie,7,17 April 2021,"If you plan on watching this movie thinking it will be a sequel of the iconic 1939 film starring Judy Garland, you will be sorely disappointed. Return to Oz is more of a sequel to the original Wizard of Oz book by L Frank Baum than the 1939 musical. If you have read the book you would already know that it has many differences from the movie. This movie is based on two follow-up Oz books books Baum wrote after the original. With a much darker twist and elements of horror this may not be the best movie for kids, but it's enjoyable for adults if you are looking for a thrill and a different take on the Oz story.",Return to Oz
88,PeoplesBadmash,A classic by all means...,10,6 October 1999,"This is the very second movie I saw. Yessirree, right after Mary Poppins, and I truly got the shock of lifetime! I had never seen the original Wizard of Oz, but maybe read it somewhere, but I really can't remember, I was around 7 or 8 then!But let's get down to business! Strictly in terms of the movie itself, ""Return"" is an excellent movie, and I cannot see how or why it got lousy critic reviews! Maybe that's because it ignores the essence of ""Wizard"" which was more appealing to children, but ""Return"" is a more mature movie, and I think it is definitely easily more gripping and far much more entertaining than the first ""Oz"".At any rate, keep in mind that when I was 8 years old, I was really really scared, but later on I came to realize the power of this movie. I saw it earlier last month and I enjoyed it as much as I did all those 12 years ago. ""Return"" is not just for kids, this is not a silly song-a-thon! It's one helluva chiller, so don't pass this up, folks!Oomph!-meter (from 5): ****",Return to Oz
89,weerdo1482,"dark maybe, sepual not really, great movie definitely",10,5 December 2000,"I can remember watching wizard of oz and this movie every night when I was very young. my mom had them taped back to back off cbs and the disney channel. although there was only half of this movie taped (starting with where dorothy is in the emerald city looking at the stone dancing girls) even though there was only half  I became very obsessed with this movie. maybe its because I am such a weird person, but I never really remember any part of this movie scaring me at all. I can remember turning my sofa into a gump and building tik tok out of bottles and cans.unfortunatley, the movie we had some how either got lost or taped over and became only a memory. But one day many years later I found it in a store in the half price rack. I took it home and for the first time saw the movie in its entirety. being alot older, I understood it alot better than I had when I was a little kid.It wasn't till I showed it to my younger cousins that I realized that some of this movie is quite frightening.I would sit and watch them continuously hide there eyes from mombi and the other creators that now inhabited oz. we didn't even make it to the nome kings mountain.although, this movie is very dark, me only realizing it now, you have to remember that all the oz books were very dark. If you have ever read the wizard of oz you would see that it is full of blood and gore. You have a man that continuosly chops of his body parts, a house smashing a person, trees that have faces have all their limbs choped off and shake in pain,  and cat has his head choped off, and on and on. The 39' classic musical, even though a butifully written wonderful adaption to the idea of oz, it in no way comes close to the actual story. This movie, however, captures, as best as possible, ozma of oz and the land of oz the way they are in the book. If you did read the books you would see that there is no place for singing and dancing.as for the inconsitancies in the movie with the wizard of oz, I do remember being a little confused but just kind of dismissing it because the movie was so enchanting. But, I think the makers put the allusions to the first movie there because they had to. other wise no one would have payed any atttention to it wasn't  in some way a sequel. Disney, although very aragunt and full of themselves, probably realized that they had no business going back and remaking the wizard of oz because it is such a beloved classic. If they had, no one would have cared to see it no matter how good it was. But on the other hand they couldn't very well go and make a 1930's style musical in 1985 to try and sequel the old one. so, they took the logical step they collaborated. In fact that is what the whole script is, a big collaboration of old ideas and new ideas. you have the next two books in the oz series pushed together, some of the plot twists and repeating characters from the  old movie pushed in, and then they made the thing alot more realistic and believable (something the makers of the first movie never bothered to do) and you have return to oz. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you can't go remake the old movie and you can't make a sequel for something that dosn't have a prequel so they had to go back to the original the makers where tied to it no matter what they did. Instead of comparing the two, let them both stand alone as different movies from different eras in different genres.I think this movie is a masterpeice and shall let my kids watch it when I have kids. and if you don't agree, then you obviously really have no idea what Oz is really all about.",Return to Oz
90,Rufus-T,"Similar setup as that earlier classic story. No classic, but still good.",7,19 July 2009,"Return to Oz was Fairuza Balk's movie debut playing Dorothy when she was a 10 or 11 years old little girl. Her appearance as Dorothy was more fitting to the Dorothy of the book than Judy Garland was as a teenager, yet we know Judy Garland's role was a classic role.This fantasy was based on two of the Frank L. Baum books follow-up to the Wizard of Oz that resulted in the 1939 classics. The setting of Return to Oz was 6 months after Dorothy returned from Land of Oz, but her mind still obsessed with the place despite she was told it was a dream. She found a key felt out of the sky, and she felt there was trouble in the Land of Oz. Because of her obsession, she was placed in a Psych ward. Eventually, she found a way get to the Land of Oz, and found all the beauty of the was gone and everyone turned to stones.This time, instead of Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, we have a Pumpkinhead, a talking chicken, and a talking computer. Instead of Wicked Witch of the West, we have an evil lady named Mombi. Instead of flying monkeys, we have people with hands and feet with wheels. Instead of the Oz, we have The Nome King. So as you see, there was some similar structure to Wizard of Oz.Despite this is a children movie, the are scenes with Mombi that I think would scare the hell out of children. She collected women heads and change her heads like changing clothes. Although the quality of this movie was far from that of the 1939 classics since it looked more like a TV movie. The adventure of Dorothy preserving the Land of Oz was however fascinating enough to keep me interested.",Return to Oz

What it lacks in the magnificence of the first Oz film, it makes up for in authenticity.This was a favorite film as a child and now that I'm grown and have my own children, I assumed I wouldn't care for it as much when I decided to pick it up so my husband could watch it. Much to my surprise, I found that I enjoyed the journey even more now than I did back then.No doubt, this isn't something that every audience member will like.

(In particular, it avoided the unpardonable offense of dismissing Oz as a dream.)*** WARNING: very minor spoiler about a character below! ***Just about everything that was wrong with it was the result of (1) combining the second book (the only one without Dorothy) with the third, (2) rolling certain characters together (most notably, giving Princess Langwiedere's collection of heads to Mombi the Witch) and eliminating others entirely (e.g. the Royal Family of Ev), and (3) maintaining continuity with some of the more absurd liberties the MGM musical took (e.g., ruby slippers).All in all, it's worth seeing, but then, all fourteen books are worth reading.",Return to Oz

It's a pretty atypical sequel concept repeated almost ideally in ""Prince Caspian"" (2004) and ""Catching Fire"" (2013), but it's got a lot of potential. It's also darker than the first one but no worse than ""A New Hope"" (1977). I also love how the Nome King is such a stereotypical tyrant but Mombi actually sends chills running down my spine.

At the moment they are about to hit the switch the power cuts out and Dorothy escapes only to find herself back in Oz. But something has changed and this is not the Oz she remembers.I loved this film as a child. Faruiza Balk really does do an exceptional job of playing Dorothy. She was only 10 at the time and apparently did all her own stunts in the movie. Another noteworthy performance is the powerfully voiced Nicol Williamson, whose performance as the Nome King really catches the audience's attention.Many make comparisons to the 'Wizard of Oz' but this film is actually more faithful to L. Frank Baum's books with some fascinating characters that have to be seen to be believed.

96,Stevenuccj,Underrated fantasy classic,9,13 December 2001,"This film was doomed from the start.  There is simply no way you could follow the Wizard of Oz successfully.  If you made another musical with happy characters and silly munchkins, it would be criticized as just a rehash of the original.  So director Walter Murch went down a different path with this one.  A VERY different path.  But one that is true to the Oz books, unlike The Wizard of Oz.  Return to Oz is a dark film that chronicles Dorothy's journey back to the land of Oz.  The film may come off frightening to children.  I was scared the first time I saw it.  But the film also contains beautiful scenery, remarkable special effects, and memorable characters.  The symbolism from real world to fantasy world is well done; there are at least 3 actors who play dual roles.The villains in Return to Oz are especially memorable; it makes sense that in The Wizard of Oz we have popular heroes (Lion, Tin Man, Scarecrow) in a joyful film, while in Return to Oz we have memorable villains: the savage, insane Wheelers, evil Princess Mombie and the powerful Nome King in a dark film.  One of the chief reasons why Return to Oz is not a popular movie is that our heroes, excluding Dorothy, are all creatures we cannot identify with.  In The Wizard of Oz the lion, tin man, and scarecrow were each searching for something (courage, heart, and a brain, respectively).  As people we could identify with these things.  And it helps that in The Wizard of Oz we have a good portion of the movie devoted solely to development of these characters (the journey through the forest).  In Return to Oz Dorothy's faithful friends are: Tic-Toc, who is a mechanical creation that needs to be wound up to work.  This may sounds similar to the tin man but while the tin man was a human turned to tin, Tic-Toc is a complete robot. Tic-Toc does not have feelings or emotions, so we can't care a whole lot if he is destroyed because after all he is just a pile of nuts and bolts. Still, Dorothy meets Tic-Toc before the others in Oz, so we probably care about him more than the others except perhaps Billina.  Billina is a chicken.  She basically takes the place of Toto as the farm animal Dorothy takes with her to Oz.  But it's hard to feel for a chicken.  Must harder than, say, a DOG. Jack Pumpkinhead comes into the story when Dorothy ventures into Mombie's palace.  He is tall, thin creation with a pumpkin for a head that speaks with a high, quivering voice.  By the end of the movie you will be glad to be rid of his voice.  He is very kind to Dorothy and a loyal friend, but because he is so silly-looking and sounding, he comes off as something similar to Jar-Jar Binks from the recent Star Wars Episode I.  A memorable friend who is not QUITE as annoying as Jar-Jar, but no Scarecrow or Cowardly Lion from Wizard of Oz.  Dorothy's other friend is a contraption out of ferns, a sofa, and a moose head named Gump who is also a good friend but a monstrosity to look at.  Back to the villains for a second: The wheelers are scary as hell. Interesting how their real-world counterpart, the drones at the mental hospital who push gurneys, are emotionless and mute, while the wheelers laugh at everything and are complete free spirits.  But listen to their wheels squeak and you will find it is the same (or very similar) as the hospital workers pushing the gurneys.  Princess Mombie also makes a great villain.  Did you catch Aunt Em introducing Dorothy to her hospital counterpart?  ""The HEAD nurse""  The all-powerful Nome King is great in the last sequence; pay attention for many connections between him and Dr. Worley.  Fairuza Balk as Dororthy gives a performance better than Judy Garland's in the first Oz, and unfortunately for her, 16 years later she has yet to give a performances on par with this one.  Dorothy invokes alot of emotion from us; she is resourceful, intelligent, polite, kind, and we the audience really believe her when she expresses strong emotions.  One such instance is when she sees the yellow-brick road torn up, or when she first notices the Emerald City in ruins.  There is genuine hurt in her voice as she soaks in the destruction of these once-landmarks of Oz.  The claymation effects are fantastic; to this day it is still impressive to watch eyes appear out of the rocks.  And the Nome King's lair and the Nome King himself looks quite amazing.  Return to Oz is a vastly underrated classic.  It will likely never get widespread acclaim.  And since it is following one of the most beloved movies of all time, it will continued to get blasted.  But watch the film and decide for yourself.  Just don't expect The Wizard of Oz all over. Expect a fantastical magical journey into a dark and dangerous world filled with beautiful images, haunting villains, and memorable characters.  And don't forget to check out the symbolism between real world and Oz.",Return to Oz
97,garlonuss,"More of the books, less of the original movie.",8,5 June 2008,"Going into this movie, do not expect a rehash of the original. This movie is intended to be truer to the spirit of the books than ""The Wizard of Oz"" was. The plot, in fact, is a combining of the stories from ""The Marvelous Land of Oz"" and ""Ozma of Oz""--the second and third books in the series. Though some minor hat-tips were made to the original movie, making it a cursory sequel only.For instance, the Ruby Slippers in the first movie were Silver Slippers in the book. Here, they make reference to Dorothy using Ruby Slippers in her previous adventure out of deference to that movie.However, the books have much more of a dark, foreboding tone than the saccharine sweetness of the original movie. (Not too much, since they're still kid's books, but it is still there.) This one captures that feel much more than the original.If your kids are old enough to handle the slightly dark tone of this film (not too much, but still dark) they should easily fall in love with the imagination and the characters of this movie.",Return to Oz
98,blakeboyuk,THIS IS MY FAVORITE FILM EVER!,10,11 February 2002,"Wow is all I can say about Return to Oz. I have never loved a film as much and doubt I ever will. I hold a deep childhood affection for this film of which, I have carried with me to this very day. The beauty of the locations and sets. The enchanting music and splendid costumes. I cant describe how much I like it. The incredibly pretty Fairuza Balk for whom I had a severe child hood crush on at the time of its release plays Dorothy with elegance and charm. Those who try and compare it to the Garland classic are fools. For a start, this is not a musical, although it is a continuation of the story - it is not the sequel. It involves mainly new characters including the impressive Tik-Tok, the amusing Gump and the really cute Jack Pumpkin Head. The scary Wheelers and Gnome King also add much to this film. This really is a must see and I urge you not to judge it with the original. In my opinion the greatest film ever!",Return to Oz
99,razasyed,A Film That Needs To Be Re-evaluated -- Upwards,10,10 August 1999,"Just finished watching Return To Oz, which arrived today. I'm still pondering it. The production values are first-rate, the conception and execution are absolutely stunning, and the music and cinematography are manifestations of some unspoken poetry. The drunken fanfares and weeping strings on the soundtrack, the poised, meditative composition of the shots, the way animatronics and claymation are used far more effectively in the absence of CGI than anything I've seen in the last four months, easily. It was courageous of director Walter Murch (who never worked in that capacity again, although he's since received Oscars and all sorts of other technical citations for his editing work on such films as The English Patient) to basically construct the film as a sort of tone poem to childhood, to the way a flat and unchanging Midwestern sky can crush a little girl's spirit.From what I can remember, the film was a financial disaster. The pre-Eisner-Wells Disney poured roughly $30 million into the production -- a fortune at the time. The money is all up on the screen, however. The sets are intricate and spectacular.Ultimately, this film lands somewhere between The Neverending Story and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in my estimation. It doesn't descend into eighties camp the way the former seems to have in hindsight, but ultimately it's not quite as sophisticated or consistent as Terry Gilliam's work. You get the idea that Murch & Co. received pressure from the suits to push the film into a more kid-friendly direction (on a par with the execrable Judy Garland version), whereas their creative impetus drove them into dark psychological territory. The end result is striking.",Return to Oz

101,ozman,A more faithful evocation of the land of Oz than The Wizard of Oz,9,5 October 1998,"Having been entranced by the Oz books of Baum and Thompson as a child and having read many of them several times, I was always somewhat disappointed by the annual showings of The Wizard of Oz on TV.  However charming the performances, and however colorful the sets, the Oz I read about just wasn't a place that looked anything like a musical shot on Hollywood sound stages.When Return to Oz came out, it was dismissed by some critics as ""too dark"". Well, Oz was a pretty dark place, where Dorothy and various friends faced many enemies and Oz itself was surrounded by other lands of varying degrees of hostility.Return to Oz did a much better job of capturing the look and feel of Oz as it was portrayed in the original books.  The use of clay animation and other modern special effects techniques also helped to establish the truly magical ""otherness"" of Oz.Child actress Faraiza Balk also made a much more believable Dorothy than teenaged Judy Garland with her breasts taped flat.",Return to Oz

103,mandy-23,dark and morbid movie,10,4 June 1999,"Twisted, surreal children's stories are always the most frightening things to witness (e.g. Where the Wild Things Are, Silverstein books, etc.)This movie seems chaotic and absurd but has a very definite social agenda. While watching the movie, keep an eye open for certain conflicts, such as rural vs. urban, old vs. new, spirituality/faith vs. science and the theme that capitalism and technology begin acquring minds of their own rather than serving the people. Dorothy, right at the turn of the century, goes from her impoverished farm to the big city to get her Oz fantasies eradicated by a demonically smiling lobotimizing machine.  When she escapes and ends up in Oz (where CHICKENS are forbidden), the milk maids, scare crows, etc. are replaced by ""wheelers,"" essentially half human, half car.  The wheelers chastise her for picking a lunch box from a tree (obvious slam against capitalism--""there is no free lunch"") Despite the fact that the film initially seems to be telling us to reject technology, science, etc. completely, the presence of Tic Toc complicates this hypothesis.  When Dorothy comes upon this inactive machine which bears a physical resemblance to the lobotimizing machine at the mental hospital, SHE has the agency to make it function. Once she does this, it very clearly states that it is NOT alive and will act only as her ""faithful servant.""Very interesting movie.

105,kagrisier,The Ruby Slippers lost their magic a long time ago.,6,11 August 2005,"The Wizard of Oz is probably one of the best films ever made. Even if it didn't follow the books as closely as possible, it still did a tremendous job of being funny and entertaining. With all this success, somebody HAS to think ""A second movie can only be second best."" And if anybody thought that, they were probably right.First off, the movie is WAY dated. All the effects and everything are quite fake. Matte lines, slow motion, stop-motion effects... All here, all bad. ""Star Wars"" (not talking about ""Special"" Edition) had better effects than this, and it was made nearly ten years before this.Also, most of the stuff was also WAY off. The Wheelers speak for themselves, and Billina is somewhat of an annoyance. Jack Pumpkinhead's voice was...uh, odd, as was the way his head seemed to move depending on his emotion. And Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz? I think NOT! Plus, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion... oh, dear what happened? I know people will say that they look like the illustrations in the book, but, this is a SEQUEL TO THE WIZARD OF OZ! You'd think they'd at least try to make them resemble their 1939 counterparts! Other than that, the movie is OK. I mean, the sets, although they don't resemble the ones from The Wizard of Oz like they should, are great. The movie has a pleasantly dark feeling, mostly because of the Nome King's magic on the Ozians. Also, besides the problems mentioned above, the characters are fun to watch and sometimes funny. Tik-Tok is probably the best of the lot, aside from the annoying noise he makes when he walks.Overall, I recommend this OK movie only if you'd like to forget about the 1939 classic, or you're bored out of your mind.",Return to Oz

Elements would come back to me from time to time...the character in ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" for instance...the TMBG song ""Hall of Heads."" I could never find this movie in the stores, and when I asked people about it they had no idea what I meant. Last night I found the movie at the store, finally, and watched it...not knowing what to expect. It was a Disney movie, was it going to suck? The cover looked dopey. Oh well, why not? I was completely blown away. Not only was it dark and frankly horrifying in some scenes, it was beautifully done. Fairuza Balk was amazing as Dorothy...and convincingly 19th century. Jean Marsh was really frightening as Mombi. The entire story revolved around loss after victory as well as recovery.

The film is pure magic and is highly underrated nowadays for the special effects and costumes and scenes and script and of course the actors (bless their hearts).The film has everything you could want in a movie, with the exception of romance. But it still has everything, family fun, mystery, suspence, tragedy, horror, comedy, and so much more. I cannot say enough praise to such a beautiful film such as this.I must applaud the cast and crew for their tremendous hard work that they did and I myself, if I met them, would bless them for all their good work in this. Truly this film shows the Other side of Oz, the one people don't often know about.This film taking place after Dorothy returns to Oz has so many new characters that boggle the mind and fascinate you no end. Tik-Tok, Jack the Pumpkin-head, Princess Mombi, the Wheelers, the Gump, and of course the evil Knome King. Seriously I would find it astonishing if people found this film offensive, cause it seriously isn't and is a masterpiece of film artistry and scope. The musical score as well matches perfectly with the acting and the film itself, I mean it leaves you in suspence, terror, happiness, saddness, I mean it has it all in spades this film.I would like to say that I sincerely enjoyed this film and like Miss Fairuza Balk said, this film could never be duplicated without the same effects and dedication as the actors and crew did in this film. This film is untouchable it is truly a magnificent film and is among my favourites.
So from the bottom of my heart to all of the cast, crew, and the special effects people, I will say God Bless you for giving so much joy and entertainment to me and to children and old alike.

The story of Dorothy after returning home from the original journey and her journey back to Oz just captures the attention of the watcher, even if they are NOT interested in movies at all. Especially when you receive the DVD and you find all the Behind the Scenes information pertaining to it. Who would have thought there was a man inside of Tik-Tok or the Cowardly Lion suit.

Watching it, I kept thinking two things. The first was how full it was of an almost child-like innocence. This is traditional storytelling in the best sense, an escapist fantasy that is simply told but packed with exciting thrills. The second was how SCARY some parts were. I know this is a kids movie, and it's told from a child's perspective, but some scenes were frightening enough to be part of a horror film. There is a scene in a sanitarium where Dorothy is tied to her bed, and you can here someone groaning in the background, possibly from electric shock treatments. Another part involving heads displayed on a wall screaming Dorothy's name also gave me the chills. Nonetheless, the story unfolds like a fairy tale, and I'd still recommend it to children. They might be surprised how a scary a ""family fairy tale"" can be.",Return to Oz
115,stephenoles,Not at all faithful to Baum OZ books,2,8 July 2020,"No wonder Walter Murch was never allowed to direct another movie!The producers and some commentors claim that RETURN TO OZ is ""more faithful"" to L.Frank Baum's immortal Oz books, but this is ridiculous to anyone who's actually read them. The beloved 1939 movie takes liberties, but it's more faithful in every way, both to the letter and the spirit of the books.The only things in this movie that come from the books are the Wheelers, the Nome King, and Princess Langwidere, who is confusingly renamed Mombi. But even these elements are garbled, repurposed and made less effective.In the book, Mombi is an evil old crone given a few magical powers in return for concealing the kidnapped true heir to the throne of Oz, Ozma. To hide the princess, Mombi has turned her into a boy named Pip, whom she treats like a slave. Pip is the hero of the second book who, in the final shocking twist, turns out to be Ozma. The third book brings back Dorothy and includes Langwidere, the Wheelers and the Nome King's collection of ornaments.RTO awkwardly and confusingly jams bits and names from both books into a new story so bad everyone involved with it should have hung their heads in shame. It begins with a sequence so wrong-headed you have to laugh. Auntie Em delivers Dorothy to a mad doctor who straps the girl to a table so he and an evil nurse can lobotomize her with primitive shock treatments, while brain-damaged lunatics howl in agony throughout the building. No, this is not ""faithful"" to Baum. It made me think, did anyone at Disney read the script before greenlighting it?But the fun is just beginning. Then Dorothy and the little girl who saved her from the mad doctor are swept away in a river. Dorothy survives by clinging to some flotsam, but the other girl apparently drowns -- a horrible death which seems to disturb Dorothy so little she doesn't even react to it.Dorothy then happens upon her old friends, the Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion, distressingly turned to stone, but doesn't seem to care. Her new friends, like TikTok, are animated pretty well, but viewers can't emotionally invest in puppets or early CGI or whatever they are. The huge emotional impact of the 1939 classic is reduced to mild dismay in this one.By turns morbid and inert, this movie deserved to bomb with audiences and critics. I give it two stars for Fairuza Balk, who does her best with what little she's given to do as Dorothy, and the sequence with Mombi's head collection, which -- unlike the rest of the movie -- is well-staged and shot.",Return to Oz
116,gliptitude,"box office failure, cult classic",9,6 September 2006,"I like world cinema, art films and classics and Return to Oz is one of my favorite movies to watch. Return to Oz is a little like the movie DUNE in that is kind of a big budget flop with an immortal afterlife (and both are 80's fantasy movies). I will eventually admit that the MGM Wizard of Oz is ""better"", for a number of reasons, but I would choose to watch Return to Oz rather than the former, any day of the week. It has a similar feel to some of the other fantasy pics from that general time period (Labyrinth, Never Ending Story etc.), but it holds up much better than the others and does not seem dated or cheesy.After watching it recently I was looking into the history and back-story of the production and the theatrical release. Wikipedia says that it was released shortly after Micheal Eisner became Disney's CEO and that he ""dumped"" it to make himself look good and the old guard who made it look bad. Many people think the many bad reviews it received were planted as part of this strategy.That being said, the movie still lacks the cohesive story of the MGM Wizard of Oz, possibly because the script combines two of Baum's books. It is a little awkward having two enemies (princess Mombi and the Nome king). It kind of feels like something is missing from the story. Oh yeah, and it is a really morbid movie. However, none of these things ruin it, and maybe they indirectly make it better. Its a weird movie with a unique atmosphere.My friend and I spent the whole movie trying to figure out how they made Tik Tok walk. Apparently he was a puppet because the IMDb lists a ""goof"" in the movie where you can see a puppeteer controlling him. We had not noticed that and the best guess we came up with was that someone was curled up inside, using their arms to walk, because the legs are too far apart for a human's legs to be inside.I guess I wrote this for my own amusement because there are already 144 reviews.

117,swatter,"The surreal, quirky feel of the books with just a hint of horror",8,15 April 2019,"First: the Oz books were my favorite books when I was a child. Oz was whimsical, surreal, and had a wry sense of humor, but it was not a theme park. This film embraces that, drawing from the second and third books rather than the old musical. Nowadays we'd call this film a reboot, not a sequel.
To put this expensive flop into perspective, imagine expecting a sequel to the musical. The lights dim, and within minutes Dorothy is being taken to an asylum where she is hooked up to an electroshock therapy machine with an eerie face. Suddenly her friend appears in the glass within that face. Then we enter a post-apocalyptic Oz where everything appears broken or dead. Eyes are shifting about in the rocks and monsters are everywhere.
As a child who already had my own brain hooked up to EEGs and run through CT scan units, the scary imagery in the film spoke to me, rather than spooked me. That is what Oz is like: it contains darker topics, in a way that more adventurous kids can ingest, like a predatory tiger who manages to control his impulses moment by moment (not in the movie). By comparison, I've never felt nearly as much of a pull toward the musical, even though it is a technical marvel and has some lovely tunes.

The story begins approximately six months after the tornado hits; Dorothy has trouble sleeping so Aunt Em takes her to a doctor to ""rid her of her dreams"" of a place that ""doesn't exist."" With the help of a mysterious girl, Dorothy escapes from the hospital during a thunderstorm and is swept away by the nearby raging river. She awakens on the shores of OZ with her beloved chicken, Billina, and they set off to find the Emerald City. The yellow-brick road is destroyed, the city is silent and crumbling with its residents all turned to stone.

The bulk of comments for ""RTZ"" revolved around how everything looked different from 1939, how Dorothy was suddenly 10 yrs old, etc...first, DO NOT take the 1939 movie as gospel; it strayed severely from Baum's original work. This work however uses William Denslow's illustrations in the original classics to depict the Tin Man and lion, especially. How many of those ""I Hated It"" people realize Baum wrote more than ONE OZ book??? Return to Oz is NOT a sequel to MGM's 1939 movie and should NEVER be treated as such. It is another interpretation of Baum's books; new director, new studio, new actors, etc... Just like Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" should NOT be considered a remake of the 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" it too is a reinterpretation of the same book.

RTO is perfectly dark original and surreal.

124,gailbob006,The film was OK,4,31 October 2006,i thought that this film wasn't bad but not one of my favourites. I thought that Wizard of Oz was the best. I knew some of the characters. I knew Piper Laurie who played Aunty Em. She seemed like she was bored in the film. She didn't seem happy or full of life. In other films she had great sense of humour. Some of the characters were OK. In the film Aunty Em never believe Fariuza Balk who played Dorothy that they was a place called Oz and when Dorothy said about a key that had landed in the farm. She had picked it up and ran straight to Aunty Em. But Aunty Em said that it was just an old key what was from their house. So Aunty Em had sent her to see a doctor because she thought that she was going mad.Everybody in the film except her friends thought that Dorothy was mad and i thought that it was daft. I thought that the film wasn't as good as Wizard of oz and the characters were different. I didn't expect the characters to be different. What i didn't get was there was a bad witch who kept taking womens heads off and also Jack Punkinhead and he wasn't in Wizard of oz but i thought that the people who played them were OK but the characters themselves wasn't what i had expected. The film is suitable for little children. They would enjoy it but i didn't really enjoy it. Gail,Return to Oz
125,kevita,Almost OZ,8,1 January 2003,"RETURN TO OZ was created by Disney to be a sequel to the original book THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ by L. Frank Baum and Disney stodgily shied away from calling it a sequel to the 1939 movie musical of that book. Having said that - they then paid great amounts of money to Turner/MGM for the rights to use the concept of ruby slippers (silver in the original book). They also cast Dorothy as a brunette with braids as in the 1939 movie. The rest of RETURN TO OZ is filled with exquisitely realized visions based on John R. Neil's illustrations (not W. W. Denslow as the first book and 1939 film used). The story line is taken from the second and third of the 12 Baum Oz books - THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ and OZMA OF OZ.  (Remember this was before movies like LORD OF THE RINGS and HARRY POTTER made sticking to a book's storyline fashionable). This blending leaves some characters unexplained and many characters with too little background info. A wholly frightening and unnecessarily opening sequence is also added featuring Dorothy going for shock-therapy treatments to forget about Oz (!). In addition the entire film was shot in England (obviously not Kansas in the film) and cast with many British actors who keep their accents. This seems odd in what is the quintessential American fairy tale. The score while beautiful is heavy handed and we see far too little of the beautiful Oz and far too much of Oz in ruins. The distance between the Emerald City and where Dorothy's house fell seems ridiculously short taken into account the first stories adventures. I will say that Tik Toc, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump are amazingly well done. The scarecrow is ok - but looks like a rubber puppet. The Tin Man is beautiful but has almost nothing to do. This is one of those almost movies - but keep it in mind for older children as some bits are dark and frightening. For children who know Oz via the books and not just Judy Garland - it's a fantastic journey that appears to be at least partially full of actual Oz citizens.",Return to Oz

I never got to watch it with my step Son but I am sat watching it at home, on my own, with the lights out. This film immerses you in a world of dark emotion control and dare I say it, insanity. So real it's like looking out the window, so fantastic it's like reading strewlpeter for the first time.

127,girlcalledned,"Dark, disturbing, delightful",10,7 November 2021,"I've been enjoying this movie since I was four and it remains to be one of the best children's films that kids probably shouldn't watch.From the very beginning of the movie you can tell that this isn't going to be your average colourful, cheery, cheesy sequel to a beloved classic. Instead we see a depressingly realistic depiction of the aftermath from Dorothy's first visit to Oz. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are in the process of building a new house but they have financial problems and Henry in particular is deeply depressed. They don't believe Dorothy's stories about Oz and even when Dorothy finds a key that she believes was sent to her on a shooting star, it's not enough to dissuade her caregivers in their decision to send Dorothy to a charming but somewhat dubious doctor for experimental electric shock treatment.Through a series of events Dorothy of course winds up in Oz again, however it's a depressing shadow of its former glory, and just what IS the deal with these headless dancing girl statues? Who are the Wheelers? All is soon revealed in terrifying detail.What follows is a mix of frightening visuals, gorgeous sets, truly impressive puppetry/animatronics, and an exceptional cast including Jean Marsh, Nicol Williamson, Piper Laurie, and a ten year old Fairuza Balk who does an amazing job of carrying the burden of such a large and well known role. She is Dorothy with an edge. Saccharine sweet and singing and dancing doesn't suit a child that has been through what she has, and Balk skillfully portrays a more knowing, mature, and savvy Dorothy.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie and expects more of the same from the original film, I have some good news and some bad news. Music? Yes, and it's beautiful. Is it a . Musical? Heck no it ain't. Scarecrow, Tinman, Cowardly Lion? Nope (well a little bit, but not much). But the equivalents present here are objectively better characters imo. Emerald City? Eeesh sorta but not really. Instead we're treated to opulent antique rooms and subterranean cave lairs. Sad and effective emotional scenes that broke your little child heart? YES. And it doesn't go away with adulthood.If you haven't seen this since you were a kid, you're in for a treat! If you're completely new to it, expect a bit of a trip! If you're a child, don't watch this unless you're okay with being mildly but delightfully traumatised by some 1980's camp but classy (yes it can be both) children's entertainment.",Return to Oz
128,jweir6,Fails only because it tries to tie into the original,6,28 September 2000,"This could have been a great film if it had not tried to associate itself with The Wizard of Oz.  The 1939 film departs in many ways from the book that this movie tried to change.  Oz is not a dream world inhabited by people who look like Dorothy's friends and enemies.  It's supposed to be a real place which she visits after getting caught in various natural disasters.  The Judy Garland version was loosely based on the story and was meant to be a stand-alone musical and should have been left that way. Return to Oz tried way to hard to be a sequel to The Wizard of Oz despite dozens of plot holes which make it impossible for it to be one.  The film should have been preceded by a retelling of the original story straight from the book.  Other than the half book/half movie sequel mess, this is a good film.  It has great effects and sets as well as a decent enough story.  The Wizard of Oz is one of the best and most loved classics of all time.  Trying to make a sequel to something like that will almost always result in disaster, especially if that sequel has such an entirely different feel to it.",Return to Oz

Not only was it beneath Disney's standards but it, also, made hash out of the L. Frank Baum books. They saw fit to combine two OZ books namely The Marvelous Land of OZ and Ozma of Oz and did justice to neither.The characters of Mombi, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Gump and the Wheelers are found in the Marvelous Land of Oz. In this book Tip is the male protagonist. Mombi is an evil sorceress who indeed uses the Powder of Life to animate Jack. AS the book unfolds, it is revealed that Tip is actually Princess Ozma whose throne the Wonderful Wizard usurped transformed as a babe by Mombi.The character of Tik-Tok is first introduced in the book Ozma of OZ. Later, he is included in Tik-Tok of Oz which features, as well, the Nome King. I will let the readers of this review peruse those for themselves.Needless to say, the combining of the multiple stories is reflected in the final outcome. It does neither justice to L. Frank Baum's works nor to the prowess of the Disney studios of the time. I've read that the movie is dark. No, it isn't. It is laughable.",Return to Oz
132,natezomby,Dorothy is Destined to Defeat Darkness and Depression,10,4 October 2006,"Somewhat reminiscent of Tim Burton's spooky fairy tale style, this is a wonderful cult film, a haunting tale of good versus evil which presents a much darker side of Oz.(Note: Especially good for Halloween viewing! Dorothy is even played by a young Fairuza Balk, the ""evil"" witch in 90's classic ""The Craft""!) Back into the world of Oz comes a haunted Dorothy, escaping from a mental hospital run by a cruel nurse (the worldly Mombi) and an unscrupulous doctor (who uses electro-shock on his patients and is the worldly Nome King) with her hen Billina who can now talk.This film shows a much darker side of Oz; the headless Queen Mombi has turned all the people of the Emerald City to stone and rules the broken lands with a gang of gaudy, screeching creatures who have wheels instead of hands and feet, and roll around on all fours. The evil Nome King and his army of monsters that swim through stone possess the Ruby Slippers deep in his stronghold across the Deadly Desert that turns all who touch it to sand. Those who oppose him have their souls trapped inside small, valuable ornaments.The good queen Ozma has been banished into the mirrors of the world and only Dorothy can save her and all of Oz!

This is one great scary movie . I mean it basically opens up with Dorothy in a insane asylum ! Fairuza Balk is exceptional as Dorothy Gail...from Kansas :-) First off the DVD is exceptional in its proper aspect ratio the image is framed right the transfer video and audio is exceptional (THANKS AnchorBay) the 5.1 mix is very good for a 1985 film which i know it is a remix but very well done not hollow and harsh to the ears like a lot of remixed movies from the past . Anyway onto the movie itself, This is one of those great highly underated films . Yes it is scary...too scary for young viewers, yes it is DARK but that is what makes it a treasure, not happy dancing all over the place with endless singing like Wizard of Oz is ! The Nome King and the headless witch WOW, when she comes running at Dorothy screaming without a head i just sat there thinking this is absolutly nuts (with a big smile on my face) again NOT for young children ! The Nome King and his ""demonic"" ??? Soldier rock creatures are amazing the claymation is what it was supposed to be and the animatronics are great . The somewhat ""muted"" colors of the film add to its over all look and feel, not the overblown Technicolor of 1939 . This movie has many surreal and psychological undertones within it . With a open mind and many viewings you will begin to pick them out . I am not saying Wizard of Oz is a bad film, NO WAY it is a wonderful film with sets and FX WAY ahead of its time and i am not comparing (well maybe just a little) to Return to Oz but overall i enjoy return much more for its darkness and at times vicious take no CRAP from anyone Dorothy (Fairuza) as contrary to the passive and when she gets mad Judy Garland it comes across as not really frightening anyone . As i said i do love Wizard and always marvel at its huge sets and wonderful overtone . But Return gets my vote for the one of the most passed over and forgoten films .

The claymation, cinematography, costumes and effects are all marvelous, and create the right sort of fantasy ambience.I read about five or six of the Oz books as a child and loved them dearly, and this movie makes up for the disappointment I felt with the famous Judy Garland Wizard of Oz. I recognized Tik-Tok, Ozma, Jack and Dorothy as being so much more the way I had envisioned them than the manner in which the Scarecrow, Lion, et al had been realized in the Wizard of Oz movie. Some of the Hollywoodized elements that people expect--the slippers being ruby instead of silver and the ""Oz"" signs with the z inside the O, for example--are still remaining, but almost everything else is quite true to the books as I remember them.Yes, it has its faults, but Return to Oz is a very underrated movie in my opinion.

In truth, it was the first attempt to, what is called nowadays in Hollywood, ""Re-Boot"" a franchise; i.e: ""Superman Returns,"" ""Batman Begins,"" the upcoming ""The Hulk"" (a mere five years after the first ""Hulk""). Walter Murch's desire was to make a film that reflects the spirit and the look of the source material. Taken from this perspective, the film succeeds spectacularly.Early drafts of the screenplay had the Nome King wearing Ozma's magic belt (those who've read the books know what this is), and then the silver slippers from the original book. Under threat of a lawsuit from MGM (who believes to this day that they own any and all rights to anything remotely connected to OZ even though the books the movie was based on have been public domain since the 60's) Disney cowardly forced the filmmakers to make the change to Ruby Slippers, thereby implying that the movie was a ""sequel."" Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, and George Lucas reportedly helped Murch behind the scenes. Unfortunately, this movie was made during the time the same group were lobbying to bring in Michael Eisner to head Disney. Eisner proceed to dump the film as a remnant of the old regime.For those who can only think of OZ in terms of MGM and Judy Garland, stay away.For those who can look beyond MGM and Judy Garland, and would like a brief cinematic glimpse into L.Frank Baum's original ""American Fairyland,"" this movie is for you.

My parents thought this was a bit unsuitable for me when I first saw it (maybe it was the hallway of screaming decapitated Mombi heads that got them). 3 months later (or thereabouts, I'm hazy on the details as you can imagine) I wanted to watch it again because I was so entertained by Dorothy, Tik Tok & Jack Pumpkinhead's adventure to stop the Nome King. I watched this film almost once every week until high school.For new years eve, I decided to give this a bit of a rewatch and I am amazed as to how much I still love it. The memories of childhood came rushing back. I can still find things to compliment even without taking into context the childhood memories.Fairuza Balk plays the part of Dorothy like she was improvising Shakespeare. The quality of that child actor's performance (although now she's 40...Time really DOES fly but I was only born the year this was made) is amazing. Nicol Williamson also has great screen presence as a villain and he did scare me when I was younger(although in comparison with the Mombi heads, that was nothing. I loved the movie but I also had nightmares of screaming heads).The visual effects are also outstanding, even by today's standards (and today's standards would look 1000% fake and would destroy everything I loved about it through a remake). The reason this didn't win the Oscar? I have no idea.My only complaint about this film is that kids today and in the next generation will barely see this film and instead go to crap like ""Wreck-It Ralph"" which will age horribly when this managed to entertain me over a span of around 20 years.If you want a great family movie with outstanding entertainment value (if I can like it as an innocent 9 year old and as a 27 year old gay who is generally into horror movies of all things, this is a great film), than I hold this film up highly. Every member of the family will find some entertainment in this film(except maybe kids from age 4-8 - anything past is a good age to watch this).PS. I do understand this wont be everyone's cup of tea, it was hard to write that without sounding bias, without the ""little kid"" me dropping in a few words too. This is just one film I have a strong affection for.",Return to Oz
156,hrule,"very good, but very disturbing",10,20 September 2004,"This movie is creepy. It should not be listed as a children's movie. It has given me, and all of the people I know, nightmares. But still, I personally think it is a fantastic movie. Very well made, good cast, good story, Just very disturbing. Perhaps, as a children's movie, it is not so bad...i doubt most children would get the subtle, creepy nuances that this movie offers. Personally, I didn't think it was creepy until I saw it for about the 20th time, when i was a teenager. But older persons may think that this movie is really disturbing. Honestly, I think that the rating of this movie, for children, is totally wrong. It is scary. But it is a fantastic movie nonetheless.",Return to Oz
157,MightyViper,Major Impact,9,18 April 2006,"Most of the comments on this film seem to be from people who saw this when they were little, and haven't been able to forget it. The imagery of this film lingers long after first view, and its marked stylistic and thematic differences to Wizard Of Oz have a hypnotic effect on a certain type of viewer.In Return, the central theme is one of deep unhappiness with reality and a wish to return to fantasy, where as Wizard focuses more on the concept of ""there's no place like home"". I admire and am still deeply effected by this film because, in some ways, it is braver than Wizard. It isn't afraid to deal with the conflict - that the misery of a grey Kansas is very real.It expresses a rippling dissatisfaction that seems more in keeping with Baum's original works, and is all the more satisfying for it. In particular, I enjoyed the parrallels between the real world and Oz- for what it suggests about our world- and the Nome King's conversation with Dorothy. For a children's film, there is great depth in both, and most of the film can be interpreted on several different levels. The implications of the corridor of heads alone is enough to send any first year pysch/lit student into a whole mess of garbage.But don't be fooled. This also an excellent children's film, that deserves more attention than it got.",Return to Oz

All the best children's movies have an element of terror about them and this film is no exception. I recently bought my girlfriend an original script used during filming. It also has details on how the effect of the talking chicken was achieved! This film was amazing, but as I've found out more about the stories it is based on, I feel that it was a missed opportunity to do two films. Artistically I am sure this is what the director/ screenwriter would love to have done but due to tight-fisted backing and the likelihood of a bad box office it was contorted and shaved into one film. For shame. Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it. And if you have children make sure they see it before they grow up!",Return to Oz

If I recall correctly they all started screaming. Absolutely horrifying.The 3 wheeler things also scared me to death. I couldn't sleep for weeks afterwards because I had a dream that they were outside of the house... I think they had a horrible laugh as well... but I think I tried to block it out.It sounds absolutely ridiculous and I know that, but it was horrid. I don't think really children of a young age should be able to see it. I know it still gives me the creeps thinking about it.

165,dft5,"Best of what Baum, et al, really had to say, about childhood, growing up and BELIEVING.",10,20 February 2002,"Many who have commented here have said the positive things I was glad to read. It is good to know one is not alone. What I would like to add is to pick up on one commenter (at least) who mentioned the uncanny and unsettling ability of the film to portray childhood: honestly, terribly, heartbreakingly. I disagree with those who say the ending of the film is too sentimental. ***** spoiler alert ***** When Dorothy brings Ozma's image up on her mirror in her room - and she does so by tracing 'Oz' on the glass, on top of her own reflection, no less - Dorothy's adventures are made real to her, to us. Now we know what she knows and this is no dream. There is the heartbreak of childhood, reflected in those two girls' faces. There sits Ozma with Billina facing Dorothy with Toto. Ozma tells Dorothy, silently, stunningly, to not say a word and Dorothy nods. We are complicit with her. When the camera pulls back and back, leaving her with her reality and the viewers with ours, I weep every time. And that astounding score certainly underlines the point, in case one hasn't been paying attention. The video version terrified my six year old son and still does (even just the music) one year later. He watched it without my permission (under the supervision of an unknowing adult). So I agree it is not for little children. This same son loves the Oz books though, all 30+++ of them and can't wait for me to track down another one. We will watch it together someday. ***** spoiler alert ***** When Dorothy hugs the frozen, stony statue that is supposed to be the Cowardly Lion, how can one not ache with her? The voice, construction and overall portrayal of Jack Pumpkinhead - and Dorothy's acceptance of him - is precious, precious stuff. The discovery of Ozma and her reception of Dorothy are scenes that are visually electrifying and go way beyond the pap that is usually presented as children's fare. Again, look at Ozma's face when she wishes Dorothy back as Dorothy looks at her. If you have seen it and hated it, see it again and allow yourself to ""look through the look of things"" (George MacDonald). Return to Oz is a classic, no doubt about it. It dared to be different from its iconic pre-quel. It is an exciting, spellbinding, heartbreakingly stunning dare.",Return to Oz

This film is based more on the Oz books written by L. Frank Baum. You won't find any singing, but you will find plenty of thrills and creepy moments. If you're a kid like I was when I first saw this film, you might find some moments very frightening. Be warned, while there is adventure and a happy ending in this film, it also has a lot of elements more reminiscent of an 80s horror flick than the beloved 1939 film and the recent Wizard of Oz prequel film starring James Franco.",Return to Oz

Oz is, in this film, a deeply involving world, and a dark and sometimes disturbing world as well. This is the world envisioned by L. Frank Baum, and is not watered down for children, which is a truly brave risk that the film makers took in undergoing this project. The end result is a great film with a timeless quality to it that can certainly be enjoyed by adults as well as older children.",Return to Oz
168,bottledcruelty,No exaggeration; a thousand times better than the MGM Musical,10,5 June 2008,"Yes, while the MGM interpretation of Frank L. Baum's 'The Wizard of Oz' still remains a classic till this day, it is not and I repeat NOT an accurate interpretation of the Oz the real fans know. Scarecrows and lions do not burst into song every few minutes and a woman in green paint isn't considered 'wicked'.For those who don't know, it begins six months after the cyclone and Dorothy Gale is considered an insomniac. She can't sleep and can't stop thinking of Oz. After finding a key, her Aunt Em takes her to Dr. Worley's mental hospital across town where after a series of events she ends up tumbling into a river with a mysterious blonde girl who tells Dorothy that there are damaged patients in the cellars of the hospital and that Dorothy would soon end up like them.Drifting away via chicken coop, Dorothy is once again in the land of Oz which has been destroyed by the evil Nome King who has given the Emerald City to a powerful and terrifying princess, Mombi, who has the power to change her head at will! Disney's 'Return to Oz' (1985) is perhaps one of my most treasured and favourite films ever. I will never be able to shake off that beautiful image of Doroty running out of her house at the end and playing with Toto while that haunting, slightly reverberating score plays as the camera slowly zooms out; perfect ending.Before you even consider watching this thinking it will be a fun sequel of the Judy Gardland's 1930s classic, READ THESE COMMENTS. This is NOT a musical, there are NO munchkins and, in fact, the only similarity between this and the MGM musical is that Dorothy is a girl.As a child I watched this without being scared as some of the other members are. Sure, a few scenes such as the dark ones in the Hospital at the beginning as well as the infamous Hall of Heads in Mombi's palace are a little creepy but nothing a kid can't handle. I was too captured by the storyline, the great acting, beautiful and realistic scenery to be scared! And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, the music in this film is fantastic and perhaps one of my favourite film sound tracks ever. Gone are the cheesy, feel-good sing-along of ""We're off to see the Wizard!"". There are no musical show-stoppers, just the perfection of the London Symphony Orchestra. The music in the beginning as ""Return to Oz"" pops up on the screen in it's emerald green colour really is haunting and sums this dark but exciting film up.Ridiculously underrated. Blows ""The Wizard of Oz"" and pretty much every children's films these days out of the water. A must see, Faruiza Balk IS Dorothy and this is Walter Murch's finest interpretations. I really do believe that the genius that is Frank L. Balm would have been pleased with this film.",Return to Oz
169,labrat81,"One of my favorite kid's movies, with fun for adults too",8,9 August 2008,"This movie has been a favorite since childhood (it was made four years after I was born). I just recently watched it again for the first time in ten years, with added adult perspective. Yes, it is a frightening movie. I was terrified of the headless Mombi (props to the Hensons, as always). More surprising is what did not scare me. I wasn't afraid of the Nome King and his booming voice, or of the delightfully '80s vintage Wheelers. And I was not frightened, as I am now, by the prospect of electroshock on a little girl.This movie combines many of the features of the 1939 Wizard of Oz with story lines from Baum's second and third Oz books. It's the same sort of mishmash, with details that are more often true to the older movie than the books. It also continues the theme of the people of Oz appearing as characters in Dorothy's life before she gets there, leaving the question of whether Oz is a dream--although this movie's conclusion is far more absolute on the subject.I would not necessarily recommend this movie for devoted fans of the original Wizard of Oz. It is more a movie for fans of Labyrinth, Never Ending Story, and the other works of '80s fantasy. It will most certainly not frighten all children, but will equally certainly frighten some. I still find it delightful.",Return to Oz

171,fredieu4,Just like L. Frank Baum would want it!,6,2 October 2007,"Return to Oz is often referred to as a sequel to the ""original"" film Wizard of Oz, but this is not entirely true. In both movies the slippers are made of ruby. This differs from Baum's books in which the slippers were silver. Also, the MGM's concept of Dorothy imagining Oz based on people she knows in the real world is mostly kept intact in Return to Oz. In the books, Baum created Oz as an unambiguous REAL world, not something out of a character's dreams or imagination.Return to Oz, besides being more realistic, much darker and not at all a musical, the movie is truer to the original Oz as described in Baum's books. Certain key elements of the books, such as the Tin Woodsman's back story are restored back, absent from the first film. Also, Fairuza Balk was nine during the filming, which is much closer to the age of Dorothy Gale in the books than that of Judy Garland, who was 16. Although one of the chief complaints from those unfamiliar with the books is that this movie has some disturbing scenes and violence, this is again truer to Baum's vision: it was common for the books to contain such scenes, although they were a bit less scary. I recall in one of the books that they sentenced a witch to death by pouring water over her. I think this movie kept true to Baum's vision and was not ""diluted"" or, arguably, ""censored"" like the 1939 MGM film. It is a real tribute to the fans of the books.",Return to Oz

In light of the violence in movies today I do not think it is out of the question to allow a ten year old to see it and if you are a teenager or older I would certainly recommend this film.

After a re-watch I must say that I wish Walter Murch would have directed more films in the 80's / early 90's because Return to Oz was an amazing debut. This movie really captured my imagination as a child and it holds up today. Audiences wrote the movie off because it wasn't a direct sequel to the 1939 Wizard of Oz musical and more of an adaptation of several of L. Frank Baum's novels. I remember getting over this fact pretty quickly as a kid and even more so now when major characters from Batman to Spiderman are re-cast every year. The real joy is just how dark and gruesome this is for a kid's movie. The truly twisted head swapping of Princess Mombi and the nightmarish post-apocalyptic Mad Max looking Wheelies juxtaposed with a friendly Pumpkin Head and talking Hen. This was more effective than Are You Afraid of the Dark or Goosebumps for me. This is how a children's horror movie should be made without insulting the intelligence of adults.10/10.,Return to Oz

This is not a movie for children... I repeat, not a movie for children!!! It is a very freaky movie with dark imagery and themes. The problem was that I became obsessed with the movie and couldn't stop watching it. This movie should not have been shown on Disney, it is way too dark. The problem with the movie was the difference between this and the 30's Wizard of Oz. However, this movie is an amazing work that pulls in elements from the second and third books while keeping the focus on Dorothy instead of switching to Tip in the second book. The ruined Oz was beautifully done, making a mystical feel and providing the dark presence of the Nome King. Though I was disappointed that they took out the story of Tip (looking back after reading the series), this movie carves its own entry into the Oz legend and provides a more menacing and climactic conflict.",Return to Oz

179,DarkRipper777,Return To Oz; The Real Classic!,10,10 December 2005,"I suddenly find myself feeling very grateful, looking back to my childhood. Thankfully my parents never ""sheltered"" me from the world, by deciding for me what fairy tales I should be allowed to watch. Instead my father was always updating our collection, and being as excited as my brother and I were to watch them. So I never missed out on this beautiful film. I have never read the ""Wizard Of Oz"" novels, so my personal liking of this movie has nothing to do with that.I was about six years old when my father brought home this masterpiece. I did enjoy the first film to some extent, but I was never a fan. I remember loving ToTo, the Scarecrow, the Tinman and the Good Witch. I personally didn't like Dorothy and I can't even find a word to describe how I felt about the ""Cowardly Lion"". Mostly I remember thinking how ugly, annoying and stupid he looked; telling my parents THAT'S NOT A LION! All in all, I'd watch the film and wait until Dorothy meets the Scarecrow and from there start enjoying it.On the other hand, ""Return To Oz"" just blew me away. I loved Dorothy immediately and was very happy to see ToTo again. I was very young, so I didn't quite understand why they put her in the hospital or that whatever the doctors did to Dorothy, was not what they were supposed to do. I'm explaining everything from ""my point of view"" at the time when I watched it. I'm always very surprised at the drastic way the story lines suddenly change for me, whenever I watch a fairytale today.All I can say, is that I was as afraid as she was, especially cause I already had a phobia for hospitals. This film didn't do anything to me, except show me what I believed hospitals were really like! Starting from there, this film made the story ""feel"" real to me. That's why ""Return To Oz"" is such a beautiful film. Children view the world in their own way; hold their own beliefs. This film excels at making the story come alive. It has so many things that are ""scary"" to most children and brings them together beautifully! Being away from home, the hospital, night, the storm, the rough sea/river and then the deserted Oz. And its all just the atmosphere, so scary without any monsters or witches! This makes it enjoyable for adults to watch with their kids and be able to understand the fear, rather than know ""these things are not real"".I felt so sad seeing the broken Yellow Brick Road and Emerald City lie in ruins. That unsettling quiet, deserted place was so eerie. Again its still just atmosphere; war does the same! The stone statues, the whole architecture is just so beautiful and melancholic at the same time. Then came the Wheelers; the second part that terrified me after the hospital. The chase was breathtaking, keeps you at the edge of your seat. Not to mention, they're human. Personally, I always thought humans made the best villains. The scenery works so well, the ""normality"" of it makes it all the more frightening. These humans on wheels, amidst all these statues, in broad daylight.The palace was so beautiful. It sort of looked like a church, the mirrors, the organ (at least, that's what I heard). It felt safe. I remember thinking how truly beautiful and angelic, Princess Mombi looked. At least, until she revealed the corridor with the heads in showcases. I actually felt better when she first changed her head, I could see the cruelty. Then came the third terrifying part. The stealth to steal the key from the sleeping, headless Mombi is so unnerving, made me hold my breath. Then to get the powder from the showcase with the sleeping head, then the chase and the escape. Everything the way, every good fairytale should be; beautiful yet intense! Flying into the night, every child's dream. The scenery so wonderful and eerily disturbing at the same time! And then it starts falling apart, like a plane about to crash if it was a convertible! Mombi going after Dorothy, riding the Wheelers; like a carriage from hell. Another grim but beautifully done scene in a Gothic style dungeon.The thrilling chilly ride of the whole movie makes the climax at the end feel that much more gratifying, than any other fairytale with a happy ending. Its a really bright, shining light at the end of the dark tunnel. The way Emerald city comes back to life is truly magical. The beautiful statues, Mombi's showcase victims, the Wheelers and Dorothy's lost friends. The princess coming out of the mirror, the palace, the celebrations; Emerald City never shined this way in ""Wizard Of Oz"". And finally, the ""Cowardly Lion"" was as the name should suggest, A LION! So, of course this magical tale deserves a 10! It connects with you and makes you feel real emotions; fear, suspense, sadness, happiness, Everything! It never gave me any nightmares; parts of it are as scary because its the done the way it should be. The story, the scenery, everything makes you delve deep inside and experience the whole RAW journey. Parents should definitely not deny their children this masterpiece. In fact they should just watch it with them. Watch as their kids learn to fear not just ""green faced monsters that don't exist"", but the ""monsters with a human face"". During those moments, it was enough holding my father's hand to feel secure because that's how home should feel, safe.",Return to Oz

Personally, I love it, but Disney made 2 big mistakes. 1st, in making a sequel to ""Wizard,"" they were afraid to tackle the ending of Baum's sequel ""The Land of Oz."" That book ends with the discovery that the young hero, a boy named Tip, is the transformed Princess & proper Ruler of Oz, Ozma. Beautifully, the book tells of the change from boy to girl. Can't deal wioth that! said Disney. So they had to clumsily unite the 2nd & 3rd book into a mishmash that did not hold together. 2nd problem: They were fixated on the idea that children wanted lots of violence and/or horror, so they completely changed the drift of the 2 books they were using to provide violence & horror. What they came up with was a very un-Ozzy hash of a story. Nonetheless, from the opening scene, Fairuza was Dorothy! Actually, the appearance of everything was very Ozzy - costumes, setting and all. If they had only also come up with a story that fit into either Oz (Baum's or MGM's) they would have had a huge success.",Return to Oz
