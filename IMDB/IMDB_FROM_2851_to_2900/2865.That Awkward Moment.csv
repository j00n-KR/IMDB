0,bkoganbing,To commit to non-commitments,5,8 July 2014,"Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan all face That Awkward Moment in this film when analyzing their respective futures as far as friendship and women are concerned. Efron wants them all to commit to non-commitents. But things have a funny way of not working out as we'd like them to be.That Awkward Moment has the look and feel of a Brat Pack type film from the Eighties. Efron could easily pass as a younger version of Rob Lowe. This film reminded me a bit of St. Elmo's Fire. Sad to say it's not as good.It's all right and should be please Zac Efron's fans. But it's hardly anything special.",That Awkward Moment
1,SnoopyStyle,like the actors but the movie lacks heart,6,31 December 2014,"Three NYC friends have love trouble. Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) draw cover art for books. Jason has a theory about girls who starts asking questions that begins with the word SO. Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) is getting dumped by his wife Vera (Jessica Lucas). Jason and Daniel tries to get Mikey laid along with their wingwoman Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). Jason hooks up with Ellie (Imogen Poots) but he mistakes her for a hooker. To their surprise, she's at their work with a book for their next cover art. Alana (Addison Timlin) is one of Jason's bang buddies.I really like all 3 guys as actors. I like the girls. I find the characters shallow and not in an interesting way. Sometimes it has some funny lines. It has some fun scenes but they don't add up to compelling relationships or even characters. This cast deserves a better script that has real heart. All the blame has to be laid on new writer/director Tom Gormican. Daniel and Chelsea come closest to a compelling story.",That Awkward Moment
2,nogodnomasters,So where is this going?,6,21 March 2018,"Three guys vow to stay single. Jason (Zac Efron) is a NYC book cover designer who plays the field. He doesn't realize he is dating a woman until after they break up with him. Daniel (Miles Teller) works with Jason and has a friends with benefits relationship with Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). Guess how that works out...hint it's a chick flick. Mike (Michael B. Jordan) is a doctor whose wife (Jessica Lucas) wants a divorce and is cheating on him with a lawyer. Jason meets Ellie (Imogen Poots) who is everything he wants in a woman as this throws a wrench into the ""everybody stay single and play the field like we're in college"" vow.This is a chick flick poorly disguised as a guy's film. We know it is a chick flick because it is overrated due to Zac Efron being in it. It tosses some crude humor at us and some better barbs about relationships, but frankly it is the same old Hollywood shtick that brings nothing new to the table. Having said that, the actors did a fine job in their roles made unconvincing by a trite script.Will do as a chick flick rental, although I thought ""The Other Woman"" was a funnier chick flick.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity. Efron nearly nude",That Awkward Moment
3,kosmasp,Forever single,6,5 December 2014,"The German title of the movie. Apart from being more specific about the movie as a whole, instead of a moment, however defining it is for one of the three main characters, it's not really well chosen. With movies likes this, you know where it's heading. So it's necessary to have actors who can hold their own. In this case, it's the females who mostly pull the weight.And they do that with less screen time than their male counter parts. It'd be a better movie with them playing front roles. But as it is, we have a decent romantic comedy, that will have Zac Efron fans happy and anyone who likes his/her comedy light satisfied too.",That Awkward Moment
4,utgard14,A Chick Flick with Dudes,1,14 June 2014,"Well this is complete and utter excrement. And yes, I wanted to use the other word but IMDb wouldn't allow it. This is like some lame chick flick but with the twist that it's dudes instead of girls even though they still act like girls. This movie's a contrived mess. Guys don't act like this with each other. They don't talk to each other about their feelings and relationships all the time. They don't show each other their privates. These guys were more like girlfriends than guy friends. This is some Sex and the City garbage.Listed as the director and writer of this is Tom Gormican. No clue who that is but I hope this is his last film. I feel sorry for Mr. Gormican that he apparently has no straight male friends. If he is going to write a story about straight guys perhaps he should be familiar with the subject somewhat. Here's the first clue for you, Tom: straight guys do not whip their wangs out in front of each other nor do we discuss them with each other or want to see each other's wangs. We're not always thinking about wangs. That's just some gay fantasy that's as authentic as straight guys thinking that all female sleepovers end with sexy lesbian pillow fights. We also don't talk about our feelings with each other like we're on Dr. Phil. This is just a complete crapper. Skip it unless you like movies that are terrible.",That Awkward Moment
5,neil-476,"Likable rom-com-bromance, missed opportunity.",7,7 February 2014,"When Mikey's marriage breaks up, his friends Jason and Daniel see an opportunity to reinstate the old gang of three womanising bachelors (not that the two of them had ever stopped), and the three of them make a vow to that effect. Of course, what happens is that both Jason and Daniel immediately find themselves faced with relationships which demand an intimate commitment which files in the face of the vow. And so it goes...This film, a cross between a romcom and a bromance, had a big opportunity to defy the formula and not have its characters screw things up for themselves (to set up the Act 3 jeopardy) by sticking with the singles vow - I really wanted the film not to do that, but it did it anyway.And that was a shame, because in most other respects it was very enjoyable. All the characters were likable, the chemistry between the three friends - and within the three couples - was effective, the script was enjoyable (albeit not packed with laugh-out-loud moments), and I smiled most of the way through.My only reservations were 1) the missed opportunity to sidestep the formula, 2) far too much unnecessary bad language, and 3) a sex-based movie featuring the usual coy avoidance of anything visually explicit (S-shaped sheets which come to the waist on the man and the neck on the woman, for instance).",That Awkward Moment
6,ferguson-6,"Unfunny, Unnecessary, Unbelievable",3,1 February 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writing about lousy movies is no fun, but if I can save even one person from wasting $10 and two hours on this garbage, it's worth it. The only way this got the green light is because of the success of The Hangover movies, Sex and the City, and HBO's ""Girls"". The difference is that all of those projects had a sense of humor and style, while writer/director Tom Gormican somehow finds it creative to end numerous scenes with someone calling someone else either 'a f***ing idiot' or 'an A-hole'.Mr.Gormican's only other listed credit is as Producer for the gross out Movie 43. Let's just say he is now 0-for-2, and here's hoping he never gets a shot at number 3. This is such a waste of a talented group of up and coming actors. Zac Efron loses whatever credibility he has built up since High School Musical by playing Jason the Jerk. OK, I added the Jerk part, but it's true. Jason is best friends and co-worker with Daniel, played by Miles Teller, who was so good in The Spectacular Now. Daniel is a simple-minded misogynist with a razor sharp tongue. They are both friends with Mikey, a young doctor whose wife dumps him. Mikey is played by Michael B Jordan, a standout in last year's Fruitvale Station. These twenty-somethings make a drunken pact to stay single and build their roster of casual sex partners, thereby avoiding the awkward moment of ""So ... where is this relationship headed?"" The guys live like frat boys, guzzling booze while spouting ""jokes"" on such thought-provoking topics as poop, penis, masturbation, homosexuality, and Viagra. To add even more insult to humanity, there are four female roles that could set back women's advancement by 100 years ... should anyone actually see this pile of junk. Imogene Poots, Jessica Lucas, Addison Timlin and MacKenzie Davis are all smart, beautiful women who somehow associate with these dunces. For the record, Jordan's character is not as classless as the others, but guilt by association cannot be ignored.Miles Teller still has the potential to be the next John Cusack, and Michael B. Jordan clearly has a future if he avoids projects like this, and Zac Efron will probably take his perfect face and go back to sweet romantic comedies. The four key actresses should all bounce back soon with far superior projects ... movies that don't denigrate men, women and movie soundtracks (it may be the worst since the 1980's).",That Awkward Moment
7,morrison-dylan-fan,So Awkward.,7,17 January 2015,"With a poll being held on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2014,I felt that it would be a good time to view an easy- going Rom-Com.Talking to a family friend,I found out that he had recently gotten hold of a Rom-Com on DVD,that he found to be far better than expected,which led to me getting ready to find out how awkward things could be.The plot:After their pal Mikey is dumped by his long-term girlfriend,best friends Jason & Daniel decide that they will help Mikey out by forming a trio,with the goal being that they each get a roster of girls who they can sleep with,and that none of them enter a serious relationship.Going out doing a night on the town,the gang each catch the attention of various girls who soon start to let the boys to build their roster.Despite having made promises' to each other that they would never fall in love for any woman,each of the gang begin to have doubts on the vow that they made.View on the film:Filmed on location in New York, debuting writer/director Tom Gormican and cinematographer Brandon Trost use light blue and amber colours to create a smooth,breezy atmosphere.Whilst the title sets it self up to be a raunchy fest,Gormican shows himself to be surprisingly nervous over showing even the slightest hint of exposed flesh,with pillows/towels being used to stop the men & women watching the movie from seeing any ""bonus features.""Similar to his directing style,Gormican displays an unexpected level of charm in the screenplay,with the films initial burst of gross-out humour slowly fading into the background,and being replaced by a delicious light Comedy touch,which mixes hilarious slap-stick (such as the worst party dress code possible!) with dollops of silky Rom- Com.Featuring in every scene, Zac Efron, Miles Teller & Michael B. Jordan each give terrific performances which complement the other pals weaknesses,as Jordon shows Mikey to be the stern adult member of the gang,whilst Efron reveals Jason to be a rugged outside,and Miles Teller catches every one-liner flying,as they each find out how awkward their vow can be.",That Awkward Moment
8,anaconda-40658,Viewing This Film is Several Awkwardly Bad Moments.,1,4 May 2015,"That Awkward Moment (2014): Dir: Tom Gormican / Cast: Zac Efron, Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Imogen Poots, Jessica Lucas: Pathetic hunk of trash about that moment when someone goes from casual dating to full flown relationship. We have three morons played by Zac Efron, Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan. After Jordan's wife confesses to cheating he falls into a depression of liquor and ice cream. Perhaps giving him a script to a better film is out of the question for knocking this depression. Instead his buddies take him out drinking and chick hunting. This is where Efron picks up a woman whom he believes is a hooker by night's end. To make this even more manipulative she ends up showing up at his work place while he is giving a presentation on book covers. The buddies make a pact to remain single and only screw around but we all know that they will go through the media's version of falling in love. Jordan attempts to rekindle with his cheating wife. Teller is bedding a woman who was his originally just a bed buddy. I guess she has forged ahead nicely. Efron goes through heartache with Imogen Poots because she sees him as a thoughtless jerk. Jessica Lucas was last seen in Evil Dead and this is even more distorted career move. First time director Tom Gormican does everything but place black boxes on screen to avoid nude scenes all the while we get lame references to Jordan's penis. Another joke involves Teller stinking up the washroom. Here's an idea. Why not every viewer have an awkward moment rewarded with shitting over every print of this dreadful film.

Its very old-fashioned. However, Tom Gormican's Screenplay redeems itself with humor & light-moments. Also, the Bromance between its male characters, is infectious. Gormican's Direction, on the other-hand, is simple. Cinematography & Editing are adequately done.Performance-Wise: Zac Efron enacts his part well, although he could lose some fat from his face! Miles Teller & Michael B. Jordan are the real performers in here. Both of the actors, are excellent. And the on-screen Bromance between Efron/Teller/Jordan, is wonderful. Imogen Poots is cutely restrained. Mackenzie Davis looks gorgeous & delivers a very believable performance. Jessica Lucas is okay.On the whole, 'That Awkward Moment' isn't awkward at all.",That Awkward Moment
10,Hellmant,Funny at times but more awkward than anything else!,6,13 February 2014,"'THAT AWKWARD MOMENT': Three Stars (Out of Five) Sex comedy flick from first time director/writer Tom Gormican. It stars Zac Efron, Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan as three young men trying to have casual relationships with women (involving primarily just sex) while not actually dating. It was originally titled 'ARE WE OFFICIALLY DATING' (which is how it was released in Australia). That title does fit the storyline more but I think the one they went with is appropriate as well; because the movie is funny at times but it's also more awkward than anything else.Efron plays Jason, Teller plays Daniel and Jordan plays Mikey. The three are best friends and Jason and Daniel (who work together at a publishing company designing book covers) are trying to help Jordan (a young doctor) get through a difficult divorce. They celebrate being single (by going out to the bars and hooking up) and make a pact to stay that way. Each is tempted to renege on their agreement with one another when their sexual relationships become more serious.The film reminds me a lot of 80s youth sex comedies, I loved growing up, but it's not quite as good. Most of the jokes and situations seem like they probably read a lot funnier on paper but don't play that way (and Gormican's script was listed on the 2010 'Hollywood Black List'; as one of the best un-produced comedies). The three lead actors have all been in much better films recently, so you should be able to expect a lot more coming from them, but in this movie their delivery is just 'awkward' (mostly)! I think it's primarily just the inexperienced director's fault. He does get the style and mood of the film right though and his script must have been pretty well written. It is worth seeing for a few chuckles if you really like the genre.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5TT6LZ7cFI",That Awkward Moment
11,Buddy-51,No more than passable,5,25 June 2014,"Like any trio of college buds who are now making their way in New York City (any trio of young men in the MOVIES, that is), Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) are having trouble with women. When Mikey is served with divorce papers, Jason and Daniel agree to remain single and uncommitted till such time as their cuckolded buddy feels like returning to the field.With screenplay and direction by Tom Gormican, ""That Awkward Moment"" treads upon some mighty shopworn territory at this point, but the general likability of the stars helps to mitigate some of the familiarity. Ditto for Imogen Poots, Mackenzie Davis and Jessica Lucas who play the various women in their lives who come along to tempt the boys to break their pact. And at least when the movie is indulging in one of those only-in-the-movies scenes that are so endemic to the romantic comedy genre, it seems slyly aware of that fact.Not particularly distinguished or memorable, but enjoyable enough while it's going on.",That Awkward Moment
12,Robert_duder,Brainless and formulaic and yet fun so who cares,7,5 February 2014,"I will never understand how reviewers on films like this all say the same thing. They will drone on about how much this sucked because it was the ""same old"" and ""crude."" What exactly were you expecting? I had only seen a brief passing trailer of this, barely paid attention and yet I knew going in EXACTLY what my expectations should and would be and guess what? It was sheerly entertaining. Was it perfect? No, far from it. But it had some surprises from a film making perspective and it turned out to be very watchable. I could also drone on for hours about all the negative aspects because if one goes in expecting some brand new concept and some Award winning brilliant comedy then you are a literally a fool. It is formulaic, it is so cookie-cutter-copy that it hurts sometimes to watch it. We have seen this hundreds of times before. The characters are all very shallow and almost unlikable and yet you do find yourself enjoying their awful company and rooting for their stupidity. I'm not sure this is the type of comedy where you should be looking for someone to relate to. All three of them are firmly representing the ""Hipster"" culture that people love to hate. The way they dress, where they hang out, their forcefully artistic loft apartment complete with a large collection of vinyl records in the background all point to New York hipsters but is that really reason to hate the film? I was actually impressed that the film was more dramatic than I anticipated and had some genuinely funny raunchy moments. Is it the type of film I would add to my collection? No. But for a one off evening of mindless entertainment...it succeeds.I never considered myself a Zac Efron fan by any means. Then I actually had the opportunity to see him in person and he impressed me with how good he was with his screaming fans and then he impressed me again in a dramatic turn in ""Parkland."" He absolutely has the charisma on screen to be a good adult actor and we will see where this takes him. He is rather shallow and pigheaded in this film but you do want to see him find some redemption and find love. He also has one of the funniest and most awkward moments in the film (arriving at a party rather...under-dressed we will say.) Miles Teller seems to be showing up a lot lately and yet I feel like he is always this character. Unfortunately for him the character is the most predictable and formulaic as the smart mouthed womanizing best friend. He's Stifler all over again but for this type of film he is necessary and he does it well. Michael B. Jordan is probably the most talented member of the cast and he does decently but is sort of the serious role compared to Efron and Teller. He was absolutely the most likable out of the three of them. At first I thought like they were really trying to force the chemistry between the three best friends because their relationship is really what drives this film as a ""buddy comedy"" but they seem to get their groove later on and the three of them were fun together and believable as buddies. Imogen Poots, Mackenzie Davis and Jessica Lucas are the three girls playing opposite the boys. Poots is decent in her role and definitely has good chemistry with Efron but her role too is painfully obvious as the ""hipster"", free spirited, perfect guys-girl. Again, she is necessary to make this type of movie work. I really enjoyed Davis' character as she plays ""wing-girl"" to the boys. She was really left underdeveloped as a character because she could have done more but she did pretty well. Lucas is almost non-existent in her role and barely gets screen time let alone character development.You cannot fault a film for aiming at a specific demographic and genre and then firmly placing itself there. There is a market for this type of film. Fans of crude romantic comedies like this one will expect certain details to be there even if we've seen it a thousand times. I am quite surprised that Tom Gormican who wrote and directed this film is so new to the scene. Usually a brand new director and writer who directs his own screenplay equivalents to a straight to DVD release and its a disastrous mess. This isn't a mess. However, certainly more experience and talent could have made this far better. I honestly don't want anyone to misunderstand me...this isn't a great movie by any means. It is just barely a good movie but as I said for a single night at the movies, I laughed and I enjoyed the characters and it was okay. I didn't hate anything about it. I review strictly according to entertainment and this entertained for an hour and a half, no more and no less. Also I was very impressed with the New York scenery. I thought Gormican did a terrific job of making the backdrop of New York an integral part of the story. From the lovely narrow street shots to the parks where they meet and the townhouses and bars they hang out in. It actually made me want to be in New York. Go in with proper expectations or if you love this type of film then you won't be disappointed. Don't over expect a lot from this one and I mean that as a backhanded compliment. 7/10",That Awkward Moment
13,inkblot11,It is awkward to love romcoms but you find this type isn't the kind you like best!,6,18 February 2014,"Jason (Zac Efron) has two close friends. One is Daniel (Miles Fuller), who is a happily single man like Jason. The other is Dr. Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) who is married to his med-school sweetheart and is committed to her and to his profession. Unhappily, Mikey's wife surprises him with divorce papers, leaving him emotionally stung. To cheer him up, the other two gents tell him they are going to school him on how ""to play the field"" and also that they won't fall for some random dame until he finds love again. No sooner are these words spoken, however, than Jason meets a lovely lass, Ellie (Imogen Poots), who seems just right for him in every way. Then, Daniel is amazed that he, too, is struggling with growing affection for a longtime friend, Chelsea (MacKenzie Clark). Therefore, this news must be kept from Mikey. Can it be so? Also, is Dr. Mikey seeing a gal on the sly as well? Well, folks, its awkward to love romcoms, like I do, and have to settle for flicks like this. Hollywood used to put out more for its romantic comedy fans; now, they try to disguise them as something else. Hence, this offering arrives. Yes, Efron is an engaging performer and the other two males are the same, to a lesser degree. But, to please the males who take their ladies out on date night, the newly improved romcom has raunchy undertones and a plethora of bad language. As the characters talk of building ""rosters"" of females to call whenever they need female companionship, some will take offense. The female roles, featuring a nice turn by Poots, are ""objects"" until they prove otherwise. So, again, this will not be everyone's cup of tea. The Manhattan settings are wonderful, especially Gramercy Park which few will ever see, and the costumes are fine, too. But, while the script is funny at times, it also takes the low road a great deal of the way and the direction is just a notch above average. In short, if you are desperate for romantic comedy, as this viewers always is, go see it and complain at your leisure. But, if you prefer lovely flicks like Return to Me or Must Love Dogs, you might want to pass it by.",That Awkward Moment

One night they decide to make a pact, they will all stay single and not get into a real relationship. What starts off as an easy idea becomes tougher when Jason meets Ellie, Daniel spends more time with Chelsea and Mikey sees his wife again. Now the hardest part is trying to keep what each one is doing a secret from the others. First of all I will say that this is a pretty funny movie and I do recommend this. On the other hand the characters Jason and Daniel are kind of hard to root for. They both have their redeeming qualities and are great when they are with the girls they like, but when they are with their friends they are awful people and really unlikable. This is really nothing more then another American Pie type movie with aspects of Judd Apatow. I liked it and laughed all the way through. The only negative thing about it is that it is so predictable but when you watch movies like this you expect that anyway. Overall, funny and light hearted. A movie that both sexes will like about equally. I give this a high B+.",That Awkward Moment

19,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,3,30 May 2015,"The story is about three friends who are facing some problems with relationships and so they decide to stay single. This movie is a medley of cheek flick romance and the Hangover. It tries to be more 'manly' and show the perspective of the romance through the eyes of three guys, each with different opinion over the matters of love and companionship. But it ends up being just a romantic comedy. The way things are presented is pretty much the well known way, boy meets girl, boy wants to have a no stains attach relationship, boy fells in love with the girl eventually, and the such. Maybe the married couple story, and the man's fight to be single again and accept that his marriage is over, is the more mature story out of the three, with more depth than the rest of the movie has as a whole. There are times that the film gets funny and entertaining, but mostly it feels like a movie that want to say too much but ends up losing its way.

20,leonblackwood,Average teenage movie!,4,8 June 2014,"Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie. Watching 3 teenagers falling in love after making a pact that they were going to stay single, does come a bit tedious after a while, and I didn't find it that funny. I'm getting a bit fed up with watching these American teenage movies about casual sex and fly by night girlfriends and boyfriends because it just isn't that easy in real life. Well not in my life. If your Zac Efron then it would be that easy, but for your everyday person, it really isn't. Anyway, the storyline was quite simple and watchable because you want to see how the whole story pans out between the 3 best friends, but I personally have seen this type of film many times before and this one didn't really stand out. Average! Round-Up: Although this film was made on a small budget, it was always going to make a profit with Zac Efron playing the lead because he seems to be on fire at the moment. I think that he will always be type casted because of his High School Musical days and his pretty boy looks, so it's a bit hard to take him that seriously as an all round actor. Anyway, all of the other cast members in the movie put in average performances, due to the script which wasn't that technical or out of the norm. It's basically light hearted fun with a deep undertone.Budget: $8million Worldwide Gross: $40.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there buddy movies about 3 friends falling in love, even though they made a pact to stay single. 4/10",That Awkward Moment
21,matthewssilverhammer,That Awkward Movie,2,10 February 2014,"The ad campaign for TAM gives the impression that it will be, at the very least, a fun romp, but don't be fooled. TAM asks us to sympathize for and laugh with the most deplorable and chauvinistic of characters, like the obnoxious guys in high school who thought they were funny but weren't. Every ""joke"" is about poop or sex, which can be funny. Here, however, they are so poorly delivered and juvenile it's hard to tell if they were even meant as jokes or just as statements of misguided philosophy. We follow three best friends who decide to call off real relationships in lieu of hooking up with as many women as possible. This tired story and accompanying dialogue are not only uninspired, inauthentic, and stupid, but make no tonal sense here. The drastic jumps from bad sex comedy to melodrama are so clumsy it's hard to know whether to blame the editing, the directing, or the script. Such a shame considering of the waste of young talent. Sure, Teller presents moments of charm, but no one is really given anything of quality to work with. There are a few laughs, but for the most part I couldn't help feeling like I was watching a soon-to-be canceled sitcom. The writers seemed more interested in writing bad one-liners than creating originality or emotional connection between characters. Even my wife, who normally loves anything classified as ""romance"" and/or ""comedy"", resorted to playing Candy Crush for the last half. If you're looking for a funny bro-mance, go see Anchorman 2.

Jordan-Fruitvale Station, Red Tails and Imogen Poots-Fright Night-2011, 28 Weeks Later.This is a romantic comedy about the relationships of twenty year olds and their hook-up mentality. Zac, Miles and Michael are three best buds, and have been ever since college. Michael is the only one of the three that is married. When Michael's marriage goes on the rocks, Zac and Miles decide to comfort him by making a pact; they will all just bed as many girls as possible, without getting serious. Their definition of serious involves the girl using the word 'So', as in 'So, where is our relationship going?' The guys call this that awkward moment. Then, of course, Zac meets Imogen, Miles falls for a close friend and Michael tries to get back with his estranged wife. All pacts are eventually thrown out the window. There is some nudity, mostly the guys, but nothing too graphic is really shown; when they are nude, they are nude, but certain parts are discreetly blocked by something-There is a funny scene that is actually educational; I'm not sure if it is true-I have not tried it-but you learn how to urinate, while having an erection.

This isn't HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL any more; this is the rest of your life, actor Zac Efron (that is, ""the real world""). You've just got to realize that some characters in the movies have irredeemable, hate-inducing roles. For instance, ""the Wicked Witch of the West"" cooks her own goose when she throws that fireball from the roof of Tin Man's cabin at Scarecrow midway through THE WIZARD OF OZ. Similarly, the shark in JAWS is toast as soon as he munches the bikini chick for a late night snack in one of the opening scenes.

27,3xHCCH,'Sex and the City' for Single Guys,5,30 January 2014,"""That Awkward Moment"" is a romantic/sex comedy about three male best friends in their twenties living in New York City. Two of them, Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller), work all book cover designers in a publishing house. The other, Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), is an emergency room doctor. While Jason and Daniel are happily swinging singles with their rosters of girlfriends, Mikey has just been told by his wife that she wants a divorce. All three guys promise to each other that they would all remain single together. Unknown to his friends though, Mikey strove to revive his marriage with wife Vera (Jessica Lucas). On the other hand, Jason meets and gets close to a new girl Ellie (Imogen Poots). Daniel begins to see his BFF- and pick-up partner Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis) in a different light. Can all three yuppies actually keep steadfast in their fraternal pledge?Zac Efron is undeniably fit for this charming yet shallow and arrogant character. It seems though that he had a step backward from his serious portrayals in ""The Paper Boy"" and ""Parkland"" to find himself in rather embarrassing scenes in the first third of the film (they were funny though). However, in the final third, Zac was more in his element. His final monologue alone reaffirms his status as romantic lead. This was despite my opinion that his Jason and Ellie do not really jive together.Miles Teller plays the raunchy, noisy, annoying friend here. He is the funniest and the most relaxed of the three main actors. He remains very likable despite his smart-alecky character, coming across as a young Andrew McCarthy. His chemistry with his partner Mackenzie Davis was the best of the three pairs in the film. Michael B. Jordan is fresh from his acclaimed performance last year as an ill-fated ex-con in ""Fruitvale Station"". His character is the most stable of the three friends, and his character does not really get too idiotic situations. He finds himself in more dramatic than comic moments here, which makes his character feel like an odd man out.The comedy aspect was only occasionally hilarious when an actor makes a total fool of himself. There are two big comedy gimmicks here that will make this film memorable. One was when they show Zac and Miles try to pee while Viagra was still on full effect. The other was when Zac goes to Ellie's birthday party with his awkward sense of ""dress up."" Other than that, nothing really funny, more of annoying, grating and forced.The romantic aspect fared better. It was actually quite well-written, though treading on very familiar ground of male-female relationships and commitment phobia. When is going out just simply going out? The film was quite frank on scenes and language of a sexual nature though, with scenes of semi-nudity of the three actors. I was surprised to see this rated only R-13 locally. This should at least be an R-18 for me because maturity is required to properly understand this aspect of the film.",That Awkward Moment
28,peterp-450-298716,This was awfully awkward,1,16 July 2014,"""We'll use a coupon and get him a cheap hooker."" Occasionally I feel like watching a comedy. I don't even mind if there's some romance in it. A movie to watch while lying down on a cozy seat in a lazy relaxing way, with a ridiculous big bowl of popcorn on your bulging belly,hoping that it'll be flung off while viewing the selected comedy. The more the bowl rolls of your belly, the better the movie. That's a sign that there's quite a lot to laugh about. In ""The Awkward Moment"" you can be sure that the bowl only leaves a circular print on your stomach,because there's not much to laugh about in it. And I doubt whether the level of romance is high enough to call this a romantic comedy. Or romance means to you : having someone who you are dangling an artificial carrot in front of when it's about your relation and in the meantime maintain some nice looking members of the female sex on the sideline.Jason (Zac Efron), Daniel (Miles Teller) and Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) are three close friends from New York. One day Mikey tells them the news that his wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) was waiting at home for him with a lawyer and coolly announced that she wants a divorce. The lawyer is also the guy she has an affair with and the one she's leaving him for. The three make an agreement to remain single forever and just go on with the art of conquering female beauty. Jason is the one with the least problem with that, since this is his life's motto anyway, and he claims that a relationship comes to an end, as soon as the partner starts asking questions about where their relationship is actually going to. It turns out that they aren't really able to keep up this promise and they start to jump through hoops just to keep it hidden for the partners in crime.So it's clearly a totally predictable, used several times and all but funny subject. Most scenes were far from hilarious, let alone funny and gave me repeatedly vicarious shame. Or you are of a certain age and you wish you'd be in such a situation. And you also love toilet humor. You would laugh about the endless remarks about someone taking a crap, colored penises and sometimes vulgar sexist banal humor. In any case it didn't impress me. I couldn't even smile about it.There were also some appalling unreal situations. The fact that Jason runs away in panic after the first night with Ellie (Imogen Poots), who by the way has a nose that could be used as an over sized coat rack, because he saw evidence from which he could conclude that she could be a prostitute, is one thing. But he can explain the whole matter afterwards to Ellie and still get away with it. That sounds really unlikely to me. ""Oh yeah, I saw an envelope with money and those boots next to the bed. I was sure you were a hooker. Isn't that funny ? Hahahaha. What a hilarious situation .... "". I am sure that most women would give you a big smack with their super massive Gucci handbag after hearing this miserable excuse so it leaves a crocodile motif on your face for weeks. And the fact that Mikey's wife starts messing around because he's not spontaneous enough, is in a way understandable. But it's amazing how quickly she changes her tack after being jumped on by him in the hospital. Later she admits that she no longer loves him and is still seeing the lawyer while Mikey had the impression that he was saving his marriage. You could see that coming from afar. Apparently Mikey isn't such a spontaneous sports freak in bed afterall.There was only one funny moment because of a simple misunderstanding. That's when Jason appears on Ellie's party in a fairly compromising outfit. The biggest part of this movie is filled with irritating drivel, childish one-liners which humorous content is nil, straight dumb sex and ongoing consumption of alcoholic beverages. A future womanizer and Casanova could make use of this flick to bring his seduction techniques to perfection and make notes of the empty idle flattery and smooth talks. There were quite a few awkward moments for me in ""The awkward moment"".More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",That Awkward Moment
29,Amari-Sali,"Three 20 something year old friends attempting to deal with finding ""the one.""",7,31 January 2014,"That Awkward Moment plays out like a show which HBO would make a pilot out of. The combination of Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan as college friends, just starting their careers, in New York dealing with relationships sounds like HBO's stand by since Sex and The City. But, instead of this being a television program, which could have worked in my opinion, it is a feature film which also features Imogen Poots, and a small role from Addison Timlin, making a combination in which the actors chemistry compensate for the lack of original jokes, or story.Characters & StoryThree best friends since college: Jason (played by Zac Efron), Mikey (played by Michael B. Jordan) and Daniel (played by Miles Teller) live in New York. Jason is the charismatic artist who seems at the end stages of sowing his oats; Daniel is the happy, go-lucky lovable fool of the group; and Mikey is the doctor who seemingly checked off all the boxes one could in the pursuit of a good life.But, all of these men have issues in their various relationships. Jason has an issue with commitment, and fears the moment when a girl utters the word ""so..."" which means she is looking to DTR (Define the Relationship for those of you who don't watch Awkward). As for Daniel, his long term wing woman, who at first seems to not be attracted to him at all, suddenly decides that perhaps he maybe worth hooking up with. And as for Mikey, while his best friends go through light and fluffy romances, he deals with a cheating wife and the struggles of trying to move on when he is still very much in love with the woman who broke his heart.PraiseSomething I liked, though could be a double-edged sword, about the film was it was tried, the best it could, to stay in the middle. It didn't veer too much toward a dramatic side by really delving deep into the emotional impact of Mikey's wife cheating on him, nor did it really try to explore what made Jason such a commitment phobe, or why Daniel always tried to be silly or funny. But, at the same time, it didn't try to be overly funny and make every other scene into a punch line. To me, it tried it's best to be a movie which had a somewhat realistic nature to it. Mind you, there are moments, like when Jason is trying to win Ellie (played by Imogen Poots) back after he does something stupid, which would never work in real life, but between the chemistry of the actors in their sort of homo-erotic friendship, mixed with a decent enough romantic plot to make you happy for the characters, the movie as a whole works out pretty well.CriticismBut, with that said, it does feel a bit shallow. First off, the jokes in the film often feel like Seth Rogen throwaways that were found by writer Tom Gormican. Add onto that, while the chemistry is good between characters, it doesn't fully compensate in their romantic story lines for, at least for Jason and Daniel, they still suffer from the usual great relationship starts, guy messes up, then apologizes and then the girls seem to snap back like Velcro. And tough for Daniel you can understand why that is logical, for all he did was lie about being in a relationship, for Jason, he skips out on Ellie's dad's funeral, which, to me, would be a point of no return.Also, as noted in the praise as a double-edged sword, we don't get to fully understand Jason and Daniel. Somehow, while Mikey may not be strongly focused on, he at least we can understand for we learn he was ticking off boxes and was trying to follow some type of procedure which is why he becomes the way we meet him. But for Jason and Daniel, who we meet is all we get, and the sad thing is, Chelsea (played by Mackenzie Davis), Daniel's girlfriend, hints at Daniel's past, but we never get the full details to understand why he is either awkward with women, or maybe even in a similar state to Mikey in which he is struggling to get over the last one he fell in love with.Overall: Worth SeeingI won't say this is something you need to see opening weekend, unless you have a strong desire to see any of these men partly nude. However, I think it is worth seeing for all the leads have good chemistry with one another, be it the guys together, or with their love interest counterparts. But, considering the genital jokes seem tired, and the overall story really doesn't bring any new perspective or try anything fresh with the romantic comedy genre, again, there is no reason to rush.",That Awkward Moment
30,raulfaust,High School Denial,2,8 July 2014,"""That Awkward Moment"" has everything that I don't like to see in movies, and if I knew that, I wouldn't even think about seeing it. All the clichés existent in the genre are used in this. For instance, in here we have that awkward moment in which the couple is having sex on the toilet without locking the doors, no matter how dangerous it might me. The guy just forgot to lock it. Also, main characters make that stupid promise that says something like they'll remain single no matter what. If that wasn't enough, we have a sex scene IN THE HOSPITAL, and with a physician, which couldn't be more absurd. Not to mention that the physician character is completely unbelievable. If people used to hate Zac Efron when he portrayed the lame character in ""High School Musical"", then I'm really worried about public's opinion towards his character in here, since Jason is an irritating dude that guys in general WON'T (or SHOULDN'T) feel related to. Also, the story feels lame and Hollywood in almost every scene, so it gets really hard to enjoy it. I surely didn't.",That Awkward Moment

Men do not talk to each other like this, ever. Maybe women would wish they did, but it is a horribly uncomfortable watch.It starts promisingly enough with three guys falling out of relationships and going back into single life etc; but it suffers from a desire to be both cute and edgy and cannot decide which stool to sit on and falls neatly between the two.All in all, TAM is about out of step with everything that the Mumblecore genre has tried to do - it lacks both romance and comedy - and while it tries to treat relationships as honest, it seriously comes off as false - and not in a good way.

34,Screen_Blitz,Generic and clichéd comedy may provoke some laughter,5,29 September 2015,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies because I think romantic comedies nowadays have gone far down the mountain. With the cast of Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan, and Miles Teller, I figured this one deserved a chance. This follows by three friends: Jason (Efron), Daniel (Teller), and Mikey (Jordan), as they face dilemmas their dating lives. Jason is dumped by his girlfriend, Mikey and his wife Vera (played by Jessica Lucas) get a divorce, and Daniel has remained single for quite a while. The three guys decide to make a pact to stay single. Unfortunately, this only turns out to be easier said than done. Each of them begin getting involved with serious relationships and desperately try hiding them from each other. Before they know it, chaos between these three friends as well as their relationships with their girlfriends. This film is directed by first-time director Tom Gormican.Here is the best way to describe this film, if you picture the television series Sex and The City and replace the main characters with males, then you got this movie, only less clever and more clichéd. This film features a undoubtedly talented cast and the three main actors definitely show some great chemistry for the most part, but sadly the film struggles to come up with clever humor and relies on so many romantic comedy clichés. Many scenes are quite predictable and have a very light of true humor other than those typical sexual gags that we've seen before hundreds of times in them. Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan have some scenes of funny and witty dialogue, but then there are other iffy scenes that probably would have work better written on paper. Efron's character is very charming and witty in many ways, Teller's characters is a bit loud, raunchy, and somewhat obnoxious, then there is Jordan's character who is kind of the everyman of the group. Imogen Poots who plays Jason's new girlfriend is somewhat charming. Not to say this film isn't funny, this movie did make laugh a few scenes, but it didn't really give its best effort.That Awkward Moment is a comedy that many will watch, but only some will appreciate. This film is nothing original nor smart, but it has a little bit of goodness in it. In other words, not a film you'll find much replay value.",That Awkward Moment
35,napierslogs,Funny moments and moments that just fall flat,6,31 January 2014,"""That Awkward Moment"" is a buddy comedy/romantic comedy which is about as predictable as they come. But just because you know crude jokes are coming, it doesn't mean you won't still laugh. And just because you know they're going to fall in love, it doesn't mean that you won't want them to. It airs more on the side of comedy than anything else and delivers a lot of attempted jokes; some funny, some not very funny.Jason (Zac Efron) loves being single, probably because he gets to sleep with whomever he wants whenever he wants. Daniel (Miles Teller) loves the idea of being single, but doesn't seem to be all that good at it. Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) is getting divorced, and he doesn't love that. If he seems like the odd one out, that's because he is. One of the biggest problems with the movie is the mis-match of writing and characters.Mikey is subdued, meant to be more dramatic and offers little laughs. He belongs in a different movie all together (although I did appreciate the chemistry of Jordan with the other two guys). Miles Teller has proved as of late that he can deliver comedic lines hilariously. He was given the majority of the one-liners and I was expecting him to steal the show, but he didn't because the writing just wasn't there for him.However, Jason is the lead and Efron carries the movie. He's a pretty outlandish character – he's arrogant, selfish, aloof and ""emotionally retarded"". He even says so himself. And delivers the comedy and even connects with some drama (although how dramatic is it really when we know exactly what's going to happen?). While I have enjoyed Efron's indie character dramas recently, I didn't realize how good he was at over-the-top comedy, and many of Jason's more outlandish stunts resulted in some pretty decent comedy stylings.Seeing as this is a guy's movie, it's rather odd that the better written supporting character was Ellie (Imogen Poots), Jason's love interest. She was given less predictable turns and a more fully-realized character than the others. I definitely wish that they either turned Daniel's and Mikey's story lines into flat-out comedy so it could have been more easily relatable as a buddy comedy, or at least gave them surprising plot turns so the drama (and the not-so-funny jokes) of ""That Awkward Moment"" wouldn't have fallen as flat.",That Awkward Moment

Who exactly is the target audience for this garbage? 5 year olds who need every joke dumbed down and spoon-fed to them? It didn't take long for me to realise where this movie was going and the only reason I left it on was to see just how bad it would get.Aside from the humour, this tedious storyline has been used over and over in many other (equally dreadful) movies, with a few tweaks here and there in an attempt to justify its existence. The cast... well I don't think I've come across a less funny bunch in a comedy movie before. The script was awful, but good actors would at least get a few laughs out of it.

37,blott2319-1,It's all been done before and better,4,24 September 2020,"That Awkward Moment is another in a long line of cliche-filled romantic comedies that provides nothing that is original or interesting to the genre. In this one we are introduced to three douchey guys who make a pact to stay single, which naturally means they will all find romance a matter of five minutes later. There is some humor in the way these guys interact, which kind of saved the movie for me. I liked the banter between Michael B. Jordan, Zac Efron, and Miles Teller even if it reinforced the feeling that these guys were complete frat boys at heart. I guess if I'm going to sit through a rom-com with nothing new to say, then I'm glad there were a few moments of levity that worked for me. The relationships they develop aren't terrible, even if every single moment leading up to those romances is completely predictable.Because there are 3 different lead actors in That Awkward Moment, they have 3 different stories to tell. It seemed like the Zac Efron romance got the most screen-time, and that meant it was the easiest to get invested in. Miles Teller gets a little less time to work out his romantic feelings, but when it's a story as rote as this one, it doesn't take much. Michael B. Jordan has the most nuanced romantic arc because he's dealing with an ex, but he gets the least screen-time to work it out, which is a shame. But there's only so many minutes of movie to go around, so I suppose they needed to cut somewhere. I kind of miss the days when a film would just focus on one romantic storyline so they'd actually have time to work through all the details. That Awkward Moment is not a movie I would recommend to others, but it was not painful to watch either.",That Awkward Moment

The mind boggles, as it's a well put together and acted horribly scripted piece of unpleasantness, with it's ugly unapologetic misogyny, that the talented female cast go along with.

Instead, it's the same old dribble of raunchiness and silly humor that is spewed out every other month.",2,22 August 2015,"I really wanted to like 'That Awkward Moment', but I never found myself enjoying the film, other than the sporadic chuckles that came once every twenty minutes. And even then, it wasn't a gut-busting laugh. One of the producers of 'Movie 43', Tom Gormican, wrote and directed this movie. Let it also be known that this is also his only movie credit other than 'Movie 43', which is obvious after you watch 'That Awkward Moment'. This twenty-something romantic comedy tries to hard to be a Judd Apatow film, but lacks just about everything good from an Apatow movie. It's a clumsy flick that is clichéd at every corner with poor editing, a terrible script, and some mis-cast actors. I'm sure this raunchy rom-com will make a decent amount of money, but will be instantly forgotten.Every couple of months, we receive some sort of romantic comedy that involves a few young people who enjoy living the single life, but find love in unexpected places. And like the story goes, things go well for a while, but stuff hits the fan and everyone ends up mad at each other. But at the end, everyone has a nice resolve. I don't mind these story lines, but you have to do something original and fresh to keep this tired plot alive. That is not the case here.We center around Jason (Zac Efron), Daniel (Miles Teller), and Mikey (Michael B. Jordon), all who are college buddies who have successful lives in New York City. Daniel and Jason design book covers together at a posh book publisher downtown, while Mikey is a successful doctor. Mikey is also married, while Daniel and Jason live a life of bedding a different girl every night. Unfortunately for Mikey, his wife is cheating on him with a lawyer and wants a divorce. Leave it to his best friends to throw out his chocolate ice cream bowl of depression and replace it with a scotch filled night at the bars looking for hot sex.The three guys make a deal that they will all stay single until Mikey is not depressed anymore and in a relationship. But sooner than later, Daniel and Jason fall for two girls who come into their lives. And for some reason, these guys would rather win a bet than let these cool girls know that they are dating, so their relationship statuses are kept secret. It's a recipe for disaster.Gormican's script adds some of the usual raunchy humor that consists of a bunch of dick jokes, none of which are memorable. And these moments are usually ruined by some very cheesy dialogue. In addition to these comedic moments, Gormican adds some fairly intense dramatic moments, which don't seem to fit the movie. And we are forced to feel something super emotional when we are only given a few seconds with a certain character. It just doesn't work.Miles Teller is good as usual in this role as he has the wittiest lines and garners the most laughs. But he has obviously been in better. Efron and Jordan are completely mis-cast in this film. Efron dons a Dark Knight-like raspy voice through the entire film and can's seem to deliver a funny line with good timing to save his life. It's truly awkward to watch. And Jordan of course, is an amazing actor, but comedy, at least in this movie wasn't his thing. And Gormican's camera work and editing is so spotty and messy, you'd think it was the first time he tried to make a movie. Wait, it is.'That Awkward Moment' isn't the comedy you want it to be. Instead, it's the same old dribble of raunchiness and silly humor that is spewed out every other month.

Great acting from the players, and the player scorned, not really an original story by any means, but the cast, and production values make it worth your time. I Enjoyed the chemistry that you could see between the couples that worked, and the guys themselves, and that made this movie work for me. I recommend this as chick flick not to be missed, but I know the guys will enjoy it as well. If you are looking for a light hearted Rom/Com with some good laughs then this will keep you entertained nicely. If you want action, you need to click back or search better.",That Awkward Moment
41,ArchonCinemaReviews,More to the film,7,30 August 2014,"That Awkward Moment was a surprise and the film is a bit misleading.The film wants you to believe the movie is about three twenty-something commitaphobes maneuvering through the dating scene trying not to get burned. In actuality That Awkward Moment is about three twenty-somethings discovering and coming to terms with their needs from love while maneuvering through the dating scene.James, played by Zac Efron, is the smooth talking man with the tagline. Casual encounters are his game and he is very good at it. That is, until he meets Ellie, played by Imogen Poots. Daniel is James's right hand man at work and at the bar and, together and single, are unstoppable. Then there is Mikey, Michael B. Jordan, recently back in the dating pool after a recent divorce and getting help from his boys.The three main characters seem to have it all figured out as they play the scene and bro out together. Superficially this film could be perceived as formulaic and cliché – three men acting like boys with a complete disregard for the opposite sex. If you think this is all the film is about then you weren't completely paying attention.Yes at the surface That Awkward Moment is a generic romantic comedy from the male perspective about commitment. Littered throughout are token gags involving hyper-masculine dialogue regarding relationships and sexual conquests. There are plenty of bar scenes highlighting and parodying modern day mating rituals. The leads berate one another at the first sign of commitment-like behavior.But, the film is also a refreshing look into the male psyche regarding virility and expectations. The characters are archetypes, cases of men navigating the social scene: the married guy, the player, the singleton. The three leads are in constant conflict between doing what they truly desire and the self- and societal-imposed conventional behavior.Writer/director Tom Gormican was onto a new take on an old premise that could have been refreshing. The film's greatest weakness was its need to hide behind the mask of being this simple romcom.More reviews of recent releases can be found at our website.",That Awkward Moment
42,shawneofthedead,This is that totally awkward moment when a film thinks it's better than it really is.,3,12 February 2014,"In a bid to stay fresh and funny, romantic comedies have gone down an interesting route of late. Gone are the doe-eyed girls tripping their way into awkward trysts that somehow turn into true love. Instead, rom-coms these days are upping the raunchy factor and spinning a more dude-friendly take on the romantic relationship - presumably to trick more guys into turning up at the cinema. The largely unfunny That Awkward Moment is the latest film trundling off that particular production line, and it's all the more a waste because its cast includes some of the most exciting young actors working today.When Mikey (Michael B. Jordan) discovers that his wife Vera (Jessica Lucas) is having an affair, his best buddies Jason (Zac Efron) and Daniel (Miles Teller) rally around. In a weird lone-wolf bonding ritual, the three guys resolve to stay single. But their studly pact of solidarity goes awry when Jason begins to fall for the sweet, kooky Ellie (Imogen Poots) and Daniel discovers that he might have a future with Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis), his snappy wing-woman.There's little doubt that writer-director Tom Gormican's debut feature film will be a testosterone-heavy, raunchy treatise on commitment issues and relationship phobia. After all, the awkward moment of the film's title occurs when - according to Jason - a swinging bachelor is stopped in his tracks when a woman has the temerity to ask him, ""So, where is this going?"". One can only hope that the film is a little smarter than it looks, that it subverts rather than accentuates stereotype.Unfortunately, That Awkward Moment does no such thing. Gormican's script values bawdy gags (Viagra 'vitamins' and their attendant acrobatic requirements in the toilet) over genuine insights and emotional warmth. There are moments that are clearly meant to be romantic and comedic - Jason taking Ellie on a tour of a townhouse - but come off as neither. Instead, Jason commits petty theft and is immediately rewarded with Ellie's undying devotion.Even when Gormican goes for depth, he winds up empty-handed. There's a genuinely emotional twist in store for Jason and Ellie, but it's handled in so ham-fisted a way that it's hard to believe they'll ever work out in the long term - as the film evidently wants us to believe. Similarly, the insidiously poisonous relationship between Mikey and Vera could have been interesting, save for the fact that Vera is written as a vile, sex- starved harpy.The cast is better than the script deserves. Efron has an ineffable charm that's on full display when he turns up at Ellie's party - dressed up in a hilarious costume rather than in a smart-casual suit - and he keeps the farce of the film running longer than it really would on its own steam. Teller and Jordan are wasted on this material - the 'witty' dialogue they're given amounts to Mikey repeatedly calling his pals idiots - but they do lend it a little more complexity than you might expect. Poots sports a great American accent and is charming despite the generic nature of her role; Davis is a joy as spunky, snarky Chelsea.What rankles so much about That Awkward Moment is the fact that it really could have been so much better. But, instead of taking the opportunity to defy stereotype and convention, the film sinks into a shapeless blend of easy, bawdy gags and misguided brotherly bonding - none of which are good substitutes for a tight plot and well-developed characters.",That Awkward Moment
43,jawneyfloros,love,10,21 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this romantic comedy because it examines the different stages that build up to the fork in the road. The five year plan is a very good way of looking at it but even with that plan in hand you still get to a point where you both say where is this going and will our five year plan work out for the two of us. This is more a satire of all relationships and how each couple looks at the five year plan differently or how each couple looks at the fork in the road of where do we go from here differently. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are surprisingly good also. This was a great ensemble cast because no one out-shined and no one decided to try and be a hack and ham it up. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,That Awkward Moment

It sounds like a good time, right? HELL NO!!! That Awkward Moment seizes every chance it gets to be as clichéd as possible and to be as unfunny as possible. Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan turn in acceptable performances but that is overshadowed by the thin-as-ice plot and crude humor, which ends up losing two good performances in the mix. To be fair to those involved, this film should have either been shelved or given more thought, either or doesn't give this film a leg to stand on. The next Knocked Up it is not. This is Sex and The City with too much testosterone and not nearly enough laughs to justify any of the plot holes, clichés or how these characters treat women.

45,ghost_dog86,Is this how women think men talk?,2,6 February 2014,"That awkward moment when you're seeing the final credits roll after watching a comedy and realize that you haven't laughed once. After a short college related hiatus from movie reviewing, ""That Awkward Moment"" is my reintroduction to the garbage that February's Hollywood blockbusters have to offer.I'm not being facetious when I say: Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller are the future of American cinema, if only because they have all proved to have substantial acting abilities. That being said, this is not one of their finer moments. While they each show that they are capable of maintaining a believable bromance-style chemistry on-screen, it is the painfully generic script and the played out concept/nature of ""That Awkward Moment"" which fails them.Many who see this movie may be shocked to realize that the runtime is only 94 minutes long, since it feels like an eternity to sit through. The reason for this being, that writer/director Tom Gormican unnecessarily forces three separate, but still very cookie cutter, stories down our throat, which in turn muddies the central ""Zac Efron is a good looking guy who is emotionally unavailable, until one special girl changes how he sees love"" storyline. The other two equally Freddie Prinze Jr.-esque plot lines see Teller as a fast talking, wise cracking twenty-something (big surprise there) who falls in love with his female best friend and Jordan having an affair with his ex wife (insert eye roll). At the end of the day, ""That Awkward Moment"" seems like an idea from the mind of someone who had just finished watching a marathon of every romantic comedy from 1980 to, oh, let's say, 2006 (circa ""Jerry Maguire"") and thought it would be a fun idea to write a script regurgitating everything he'd just witnessed...in a 90 minute format, of course. But sadly, this aspect isn't the worst of it.Final Thought: For years woman have complained about having to sit through romantic comedies depicting female characters as little more than shrill, vapid, complacent shopaholics; having no substance or brain to speak of, #KatherineHeigl. After watching ""That Awkward Moment"", now it's my turn to complain. I realize that this was written and directed by a man (whose only other film credit includes: a producer on ""Movie 43"") but the content is obviously geared towards a female audience. So, I gotta ask: Is this really how women think men talk?! The entire movie consists of endless sequences of curiously hen-ish (hen-like) banter between the main male characters, as they fast-talk through jokes concerning ""Bridget Jones's Diary"", wax poetic about the joys of eating ice cream after a bad breakup, partake in extremely long and extremely mindless discussions regarding relationship pitfalls, while every once in a while throwing in a ""penis joke"" as a way to keep it all ""manly"". I ask again: Could this really be how women think guys talk?!",That Awkward Moment

48,santiagocosme,Pointless,1,25 May 2016,"I am not going to go around the bush. The awkward moment is a truly boring and utterly pointless piece of film making. Not even good enough for a Sunday morning when all the other TV channels have collapsed. When this movie starts on your television, you should use that time to try to lean important things in life such as how to solve the Rubik's cube, study the body transformation of the Kardashians or investigate the food habits of bacterias. I promise you any of these three examples would make for a better way of using your time than watching such a mediocre movie, featuring some of the most mediocre actors of the last decade. If Zac Effron is still around making movies in 10 years time, I will officially switch to Afghan cinema which will be, I am sure, a lot more entertaining.",That Awkward Moment
49,lnvicta,Three capable leads competing with a ridiculous script and horrendous plot.,5,16 February 2016,"Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are very capable actors. They've proved it time and time again, and That Awkward Moment is held afloat because of the chemistry between these three actors. Their bromance is electric. I would watch an Entourage-style show between the three of them and their antics, it's that believable. Unfortunately, the material they have to work with here is artificial and stupid. There are some lines in this movie that no one would ever say. And I know that's usually the case with romantic comedies, but this movie takes it a step further and totally demeans women every chance it gets, and I'm not one to point out misogyny in movies, but it just gets stupid after a while. ""Let's all make a pact to not get into a relationship! Let's keep having sex with random girls and never fall in love! High-five!"" It's such a dumb premise, and it's like the script keeps wanting you to hate these characters until they ""redeem"" themselves by the end but again, it's so artificial that you don't buy a second of it.It's certainly watchable due to the three leads, but ultimately you're left wishing the movie was good enough to accommodate for the acting talent. There are a couple chuckle-worthy moments, and some clever banter between the three guys, but most of the comedy falls flat and the romance is absolutely insane from beginning to end. You don't believe these relationships for a second. The dialogue for the most part is asinine. It turns the characters into caricatures at times because of how fake it is. No one in their right mind would say these things, and no woman in their right mind would react positively to these things. It's so forced from beginning to end.That Awkward Moment isn't a bad movie. It would've been terrible if they cast average actors, but thankfully the stellar cast keeps the movie watchable and mildly entertaining until the end. As a romcom it's insane, but then again, most of them are so you should know what you're getting into with That Awkward Moment.",That Awkward Moment

Sure i could look at a thesaurus and rhyme off a sea of synonyms to kick start my inability to word it correctly. But the movie is that dreadful it's really not worth the time; it has already wasted 2 hours of my life (if you include the trailers).The acting...by everyone is a shambles. Unconvincing, lazy, mundane. And the avalanche of awkward moments that pummel the viewer do not entertain; they make you depressed. I've seen Zac Efron display some good acting in ""The Paperboy"" and ""Parkland"", but with this being a ""comedy"" i have now became slightly afraid that he is going to ruin the upcoming ""Neighbors"" in which he stars alongside Seth Rogen. As far as the other two main characters.....well lets just say i hope to never see Michael B Jordan again. He is terrible; the blueprint of somehow who tries to be funny but fails miserably; like attempting a slam dunk and falling on your face. As for John Cusack's mini me Miles Teller well he has potential...if he weren't so bloody annoying. The whole cast are incredibly annoying actually.

55,jackbanister16,Fizzled out really fast.,4,29 May 2014,"This movie was strange... It started off as a comedy, but ended as a total drama/romance. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if the romance between Zac Efron and Imogen Poots was even the slightest bit interesting to watch. Spoiler Alert; it wasn't.Including a pretty darn good cast; Zac Efron (Neighbors), Imogen Poots (Need for Speed), Miles Teller (21 & Over), and Michael B. Jordan (The Wire), You'll figure you can't go wrong, right? You can when the script they recite is trite and infused with an abundance of unfunny phallic and excrement references.I won't divulge much of the plot, but if you've seen any kind of ""dramedy"" movie, then you can probably figure out what happens next. Guy who sleeps around meets girl who wants a relationship. In order to impress his friends, he doesn't call it a ""relationship,"" leading to them having issues...blah, blah blah.The movie wasn't terrible, but in my opinion it had several MAJOR problems...The ""pact"" made between the friends (basically the point of the movie) didn't seem to be taken that seriously by any of the main characters. It was kind of just like...""Yeah guys, let's not be in any relationships..."" Miles Teller's character later calls it a ""bet,"" but it wasn't a bet. It's just a shallow plot device to further the poorly written script.The movie very clumsily transitions from comedy to drama. At the point where Imogen Poot's father dies, the movie abandons all attempts at humor and becomes a dramatic tale of ""trying to get the girl back."" It's pretty hard to watch.Also, WHO HAS A FUNERAL ON THANKSGIVING? Pretty unrealistic scenario. I can't be the only one who thought that was weird...It ended up just being another forced plot device to further the script.As is incredibly predictable, Efron ends up ""getting the girl,"" but by that point we really don't care. When the movie finally ends and you are ready to get up and leave the bloopers start. None of them are that funny. It just consists of them talking about Michael B. Jordan's penis...Ha..ha...ha..I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh. There were some funny moments, the funniest being ""the cocktail."" The funny moments were overshadowed by a boring and poorly written script. This movie can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama. Instead of infusing the two, bit by bit throughout the movie, it tries to be one half funny, and one half not to a terrible result.This movie just further cements in my mind the decline of the comedy genre. It's being inundated by overt sexuality and the overuse of penis jokes. There doesn't seem to be any more attempt at making a character driven comedy. If many more movies are produced likes this, I will just have to stop watching them. I'm just glad that I didn't pay more than a buck fifty for this lame movie.",That Awkward Moment

Daniel (Miles Teller) is Jason's wingman and he has a friend with benefits named Chelsea. (Mackenzie Davis) Another of Jason's friends Mikey (Michael B. Jordan is going through a painful divorce with his wife Vera. (Jessica Lucas) Jason and Daniel vow to stay single for as long as Mikey is single, but what about Jason's relationship with Ellie, and Daniel's relationship with Chelsea?That Awkward Moment stumbles from one awkward moment to another. It starts with the Jason character jumping to a wickedly off base conclusion, and Ellie being angry for about five minutes, and forgiving him. What beautiful girl forgives a guy for calling her a prostitute? No girl, that's who. This movie further departs from reality when Ellie visits Jason with a bottle of scotch on her birthday, and plays video games with his friends. This is obviously a male writer's fantasy of what a girlfriend is, it has no relation to reality whatsoever. Daniel a plain looking guy, has a gorgeous friend, who he sleeps with and wants to meet even more gorgeous women, and Mikey has the most gorgeous wife in the world and meets an equally gorgeous girl at the bar who hands him her number, in the matter of a minute. Where is this bar? I'd like to go. And what is Jason's job, he designs book covers for a publishing house? Is that a job? I know what an illustrator is, what is a book jacket designer? Then when all seems to be well, there is a truly embarrassing scene at Ellie's house with her parents, and still the relationship persists. So he has a dream job, can sleep with any woman he wants, consequence free, and has a girlfriend who's so desperate for his affection that she keeps going out with him, despite the lack of commitment. And this is related to reality how? This movie is trying to be a Judd Apatow film, that is neither as funny as an Apatow film or as well-written as some of Apatow's films. When the film stops being asinine, it starts being morose, and the transition is so sudden that the viewer doesn't know what hit him.Is anyone watching this supposed to be happy to see Zac Efron, the star of High School Musical, in a grown up role, featuring cursing and sleeping around? Efron tries mightily to be funny and charming with a quip always at the ready, but ultimately, the script fails him. Miles Teller brings nothing to this role, except a snarky attitude, why would anyone date this guy? Michael B. Jordan plays a sad sack who can't seem to forget his wife, no matter what. He has nowhere to go with this role. I feel badly for the women in this movie, who are led by the nose by these men. Imogeen Potts ties to make Ellie sophisticated, but comes across as desperate and cloying.The movie is long, and the pacing is slow, but the bad script and not the direction that sinks this movie.To avoid awkward movies, visit my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com",That Awkward Moment

What's worse is that, towards the end, the director has the audacity to expect us to suddenly take this nonsense seriously.

This was the only movie I haven't seen and I knew I had to see one. I was at least hoping to be surprised considering my expectations could not have been lower. Taking into account how low my expectations were, I wasn't surprised or disappointed. The only thing I would like to shine a spotlight on is Miles Teller who definitely showed decent acting ability. The performances in a romantic comedy can never be that good considering the movie does not demand much from its actors. Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan give performances that people would expect from them and nothing more. It is obvious that none of them knew much about comedy and no doubt memorized all of the jokes that they had to say. Having said that, the jokes that they did were pretty funny, but a real comedic actor could make them even funnier. Miles Teller was probably the funniest of the three and I do acknowledge the potential he has. Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan though just had to say their lines and look pretty.There is not much more to say about this movie. The writing is above average and gives at least a new view of the romantic comedy genre. Still though, it is a cliché film, but every film is cliché one way or another nowadays. If you want a slightly below average romantic comedy and you love Zac Efron then this is the movie for you.

61,swellframe17,A bromance with a romantic comedy formula.,5,23 July 2014,"Tom Gormican's ""That Awkward Moment"" tries to not be a romantic comedy, but it follows a romantic comedy formula. It tells the story of three friends (Zac Efron, Michael B. Jordan, and Miles Teller) who make a pact not to have relationships when one of them gets divorced. Of course, they all meet the right person for them and break the pact. It's a raunchy and formulaic film that tries to blend a bromance film with a romantic comedy. It didn't really work for me though. The jokes hit and missed for me most of the time and I didn't care for any of the characters. I did enjoy Miles Teller in the film. He steals the scenes and probably has the best lines. Michael B. Jordan isn't bad, but it's weird to see him go from ""Fruitvale Station"" to this.Gormican's ""That Awkward Moment"" is not my kind of romantic comedy.

It was a somewhat funny movie with bad language and mild sex scenes but the romantic comedy it was supposed to be, bombed! The most important message I received was in relation to relationships and what ""Ellie"" played by Imogen Poots says to ""Jason"" (Zac Efron) towards the end of the short 94 minute film after her father in the movie, played by Joseph Adams, dies.""Being there for someone when they need you, that's all relationships are."" This basically is the meaning behind being in a relationship, and it doesn't have to be romantic either. As long as you're there for your family, you have your friends' backs and someone can put their trust in you and count on you, that's building and strengthening your relationships with others. That's all relationships are.The only thing that I closely related to in this movie was ""Jason"" played by Zac Efron sitting on a park bench waiting for someone because I once lived in a park on a bench when I was in the U.S. Navy, but I wasn't waiting for anyone!

Many cliché scenes where we see in our typical sappy films (which every one complained about yet watches), the guys did it instead of ladies.What's more, girls get to ogle at Zac Efron's butt, pecs and basically his whole body without feeling grossed out. Yes, if you prefer Michael B. Jordan's or Miles Teller's instead, they flaunted theirs too.""Sowhere is this going?"" A line that turned up a few times in the film, a question which will often appear in many ambiguous relationships. It was a serious case of Déjà vu for me, as that's like my personal situation right now? And I really wanted to say the ""So where is this going?"" to that person! Talk about awkward!That Awkward Moment gave a little insight to the guys' perspective of love, and brotherhood. Why do guys prefer picking up girls instead of being in a relationship? Why is being in a relationship perceived as something bad? This film skimmed through these topics, giving the ladies some hint about what's going on inside the dude's brain.Before I watched the film, I was quite disappointed by the choice of ladies chosen for the film, Imogen Poots with Zac Efron?! Gosh! However, the joke was on me when I realised that the ladies became the highlight of the film when they showed the characters why it was worth it to be in a relationship.What could have been better?...Read More: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/02/12/that-awkward-moment-movie- review/",That Awkward Moment
64,kxok630,Drink some beer at the frat house with your friends instead,2,3 February 2014,"Same old formulaic stuff about stupid fools with personality defects hitting on hot women, and somehow each finds a woman who likes a loser. There's a lot of women with poor taste in men, apparently. These are the kind of guys who wanted to join a boozer fraternity and were turned down for acting too stupid. This tired premise has been done a thousand times before, and this rehash is poorer than most. The writing is devoid of creativity or original humor. There's plenty of middle-school potty humor which even the most inebriated frat house partier would be bored with.The characters are cranked off an assembly line of dull and overworked clichés: womanizer, geek, and lunatic. They're the same old brand of self-absorbed nitwits that give the audience no reason to care about them. The acting is weak, especially the female love interests. The jokes are forced and rarely funny.Not funny, not interesting, not original, not worth your time or money. The most ""awkward moment"" of this movie is deciding when to walk out on it. Better off not bothering to see this junk in the first place.",That Awkward Moment
65,matic-boh1,A poorly made romcom,4,4 June 2014,"One would suspect that this film would offer the audience at least a fun experience and a decent amount of humor, but That Awkward Moment fails to deliver in every way. Not only does the film have a very predictable storyline and clichéd characters, it is also poorly paced and lacks any sort of momentum. The writing is weak and provides very few humorous moments, with the only encouraging aspect being the performance of Miles Teller, whose comedic talent does shine through. Overall, however, the three leading men lack any sort of chemistry, which results in disappointing delivery and causes the characters to be uninteresting. That Awkward Moment therefore fails to produce characters that are relatable on a emotional level, despite that being the film's main aim.",That Awkward Moment

No. Was it an early front runner for the Best Picture of 2014? No. Was it a good movie? Yes, and you should go see it. The film started out with a charming tone and was pretty steadily enjoyable all the way through. There was a very nice blend of witty comedy with some more predictable yet successful humor. As a mid-January release, this movie wasn't really made to amaze, just to entertain, and yeah, it did just that.The three young leading men are on a very good track. It's good to have a film with these three men early on in their careers, because one day they will all be in the elite. Miles Teller's performances in The Spectacular Now was one that made me interested in seeing this one. Also, Zac Efron, who very quickly grew out of the Disney Boy shtick has a very bright future ahead of him. Michael B. Jordan, who gave a breakout performance in Fruitvale Station also had enough of the charm to bring in some emotionally driven plot material and make it funny.The three men in the lead for this film carried it's somewhat average storyline all the way through, with an exceptionally surprising level of enjoyment provide for my theater full of at least 100+. 7/10",That Awkward Moment

He blows me away ever since ""The Spectacular Now"". So in this, he's just got the best chemistry with his friend / love interest. They are adorable. They need more air time in this flick.Now Zac and Imogen Poots doesn't work for me. It's odd and they are clearly the primary focus of the movie, so otherwise I may have enjoyed this more. Zac is too immature as usual, but that's sort of expected.I think this movie wanted and tried to be more than a juvenile comedy and just misses the mark.",That Awkward Moment

Though it wasn't as good as I hoped, it was still pretty good. It had some funny moments and an always great performance by Miles Teller, but it didn't completely feel relatable to me and the characters didn't really seem that believable. There were some bits of dialogue and scenes that I really liked of course, which is why I give it a higher rating than it deserves, but they were very few and far between and I wanted more. It is nice to see a film like this being made in the first place, something different and more original than what has been released in a while, so I will give it props for that. If you've seen the trailers, chances are you'll see the film and it won't completely disappoint you I don't think. Give it a shot! :)",That Awkward Moment
70,hera_ari,Actually Not That Terrible,8,17 May 2014,"I had my doubts going into this film. I was expecting the worst, meaning a pretty sub par film with a weak plot and the vulgarity that seems to be common in most films today but it actually was half decent.The plot was an interesting look into the mind of guys and how they think and in my opinion that was pretty refreshing because most ""date movies"" only focus on what is going on in the girls head, or is the girls take on what the guy thinks. This didn't do that, it was totally from the guys point of view which was a nice change. It may be total fiction but it was a fresh twist.What I could have done without was the somewhat excessive use of the words ""cock"" and ""fuck"" .. to me that is what took away from the movie a bit.. but overall I liked it. Being a hopeless romantic who cringes at half of the modern chick flicks today.. this was a new and nice take on the date movie.",That Awkward Moment

Apart from the ""plastic penis"" scene, the whole thing was pretty watchable with some nice ensemble pieces and hearty guy banter.The only one who did not belong in the cast was Zac. The relationships of his two friends and their love interests rang true.Would Zac have been that clueless to not realize very early on that Imogen Poots was the one worth ditching his bachelor antics for? His non attendance at the funeral (spoiler alert!}, would never have been forgiven.This film had brat pack written all over it, but would have been cast with Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy and Emilio Estevez, and been about 100 times better.",That Awkward Moment
72,yiskarasmussen,Not A Romantic Comedy...,6,22 August 2017,"I give this movie a six, because it still made me laugh, especially in the first half of the film, but to me this movie is not a romantic comedy at all, it's closer to a drama. It seems typical of the type of ""romantic"" movies being produced today, they're all just reminiscent of the fact that most young people now a days have no concept of what love is and are all harboring some form or another of commitment issues, though this movie really highlighted that fact within the dating culture of men, though in reality it seems to be across the board. That being said, I am sure that many people would get a kick out of this film, as I mentioned it does have it's funny aspects, particularly in the beginning, but something about this class of film just annoys me. Perhaps it's the fact that the characters are all in their twenties and yet they all have their careers so neatly in order but their love life is so incredibly dysfunctional... It seems to hint at one aspect of life that many people can relate to these days whilst simply glossing over the rest. Perhaps I am thinking too much into it, but unless a ""romantic comedy"" either has me in fits of laughter or at least leaves me with that feel good reaction, it's not likely to rank very highly in my books.",That Awkward Moment
73,MattBriselli,A Charming but Ultimately Not Great Romantic Comedy,7,26 April 2014,"That Awkward Moment is a well intentioned, cute, funny, kind of sexist comedy. As a big fan of Zac Efron, he gave a very good performance in a rather poorly written character. Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan also had a rather decent and charming portrayal as 20 somethings living in our current age, where the hook-up culture prevails over the previously commonplace relationship mentality.While I am one who usually enjoys romantic comedies, I was not the biggest fan of this movie. The writing was just not stellar and none of the acting was overwhelmingly great. All of that being said, I would recommend the movie to others as a good, light-hearted, amusing flick.",That Awkward Moment
74,tinusa007,WTF should be a motto of this movie,7,15 April 2014,"When I first saw a trailer to this I was sure I would not go to cinema to see it, but yesterday me and my friends decided to go. I didn't see any of these reviews before and it wouldn't make any difference in my opinion. I am not going to say that it is mind blowing, but for anyone who wants to laugh this is the movie to see right now.I mean there is lack of good comedies lately, at least I don't find many movies all that funny. The last one was probably At the End of the World, but which Simon Pegg movie is not hilarious? And I will admit I was laughing almost throughout the whole thing. It was very well thought combination of the main characters. Well the guys anyway. Zac, Miles and Micheal were great at portraying three young drunk f*ck-heads basically. Cause all they did, well all Zac did was being a jerk and a ""typical"" guy, but of course who falls in love and doesn't want to admit it. I can't really see how someone doesn't find this funny. It is the stupidest way of fun, but it still has to make you laugh. All the stupid jokes, the stupid situations, crazy and not possible moments? Their expressions and statements, ridiculous lines that made you burst with laughter. I mean a guy who comes to a party as a rock out with a c*ck out? With an actual (well dildo) c*ck out? I mean that is some real sh*t right there. BTW if my expressive language makes you uncomfortable, I am not sorry, because if you did saw or you are going to see this film, you have to be ready to hear a lot more of that kind of language. There is almost not a single moment with a conversation that doesn't include some kind of a bad word. So my recommendation is this. If you like movies like Project X, 21 and Over and other f*cked up comedies, you will surely enjoy this one as well. Even though it would make a better movie with a little less of romance stuff, it was funny and entertaining. But to have one comedy, with three different romantic story lines? That is a bit too much sweet for me, so much my teeth almost hurt me, because of all the sweetness. I mean of is like when you in fries with ice scream. Over the top, but still awesome. But it works better on its own.",That Awkward Moment
75,r-a_roe,A rom-com for the boys,6,16 February 2014,"Now its tradition on February the fourteenth to go to the cinema with your better half and watch a soppy rom-com. This year could be no different. So this afternoon I am checking the local cinema listings trying to find something suitable that would keep me in the good books but which id also find good. At first I thought 'Robocop' perfect, I then remembered this wouldn't go down well with my girlfriend. I could only find a film entitled 'That awkward moment' starring Zac Efron. Zac pissing Efron I cant go and see a Zac Efron movie I thought to myself. Then I remembered that on valentines day you should do something that makes your partner happy. So I booked the tickets and went along... And it was surprisingly Good. I know that may seem unbelievable but Zac Efron was not too bad. He was not on par with his co-stars as a fantastic comedic performance by Miles Teller really made the film rather funny at times. Also up and coming Michael B. Jordan was in good form pulling out a strong performance. This film for me reaches out to the men of this world then the women in my view as its actually about men in their twenties realising that you cant sleep around forever, and we all have to realise that at some point.another thing occurred on this day that probably shouldn't of beings as its valentines day. I fell in love with another woman. Imogen Poots. She gives another quirky performance as she carries on her way to becoming the girl next door type heart throb she is destined to be.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",That Awkward Moment
76,Seltheus,"That ""forced"" Awkward Moment.",4,30 April 2014,"That Awkward Moment tries to portray the struggle of 3 young but flourishing men(Zac Efron, Miles Teller, Mike B. Jordan), who are trying to find their place and their path in life.As already mentioned, it ""tries"" to do just that, wrapped in a series of comedic events and situations that ""try"" to make the audience laugh. Humour is a very subjective thing, so let me say this. If you liked comedies like 21 & Over, there is a chance you are gonna like this movie as well. If not, save yourself some time.Plot Summary: After Mike(Mike B. Jordan) is struck by surprise with an unhappy event in his life, his best friends Jason(Zac Efron) and Daniel(Miles Teller) try to cheer him up and go out partying, when they make a pact to stay single and enjoy life together for as long as possible and deny any kind of serious relationship for as long as they can.Without giving away any spoilers here, you can imagine that just after that incident some of them happen to meet the love of their life.The biggest issue of the movie is, that none of the relations between characters in the movie seem relatable or even believable. The 3 so called best friends do have some chemistry, but watching their behaviour affect each other in a very ""un-best friendly"" way makes it hard to believe that they have ever been more than just drinking buddies.This is only topped by the ""funny"" moments of the movie, who are gulped down your throat with forced situations who are only results of stupidity and miscommunication, or at least so they even claim as their movie characters.Throughout the whole movie you rarely even care about any of the characters and/or their actions. It manages to deliver 2-3 genuinely funny/romantic scenes throughout the 94minute ordeal, but other then that, you are better off watching a rom-com from the past who did it's job right. And for Zac Efron fans in particular...if you liked 17 Again, this movie is not even close to that.",That Awkward Moment
77,C_pa_cool,Already seen a thousand times,6,16 June 2014,"I watched That Awkward Moment expecting a good laugh, it was in way funny but much less than expected. The story focuses on three mid 20s guys living the single life in New York,and feeling totally lost when having to face relationships and its failure. I am not really sure to whom this movie is intended... It is not funny enough to be appealing to guys and not ""girls power"" enough to be girls' favorite RomCom of the year. Maybe it is because the director Tom Gormican wants to give the three relationships the same interest, but the result is that you don't have time to really get attached to any of these relationships as none of them is really explored. The three stories plus the one happening between the three best friends is just too much for the hour and a half that the movie lasts.However, Zac Effron is perfect in his role of heartthrob, and his comic potential is right on spot. He's actually a funny guy. We already knew that Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan were great actors and it seems like they're really trendy too... They're probably going to be the next big thing. I would recommend to watch That Awkward Moment if you're hesitating between a nap or a movie. You can fall asleep through it, no part you miss would hurt your understanding or liking of the movie. So go for it.",That Awkward Moment
78,Cconfehr,That Awkward Moment was not awkward at all! Just hilarious,10,14 July 2014,"I have read a ton of reviews saying this movie is not worth seeing but I don't understand. I laughed the whole time. Come on, it's three 20-something's fooling around with women. What do you expect? Oscar winning acting, costumes, music and writing? No. It's a feel good comedy meant to entertain you. And that's what I got out if it. And so did the rest of the theater, I'm assuming from the constant laughter.That Awkward Moment was not awkward at all! Just hilarious. Well, there were a couple of awkward scenes but it added to the hilarity.The specific ""awkward moment"" is when a girl says ""so...""; the three friends say that nothing good comes after a girl saying ""so"". For example: ""so, where are we headed"" or ""so, what are we?"". But this is me (a girl) saying ""Soooo... That movie was hilarious! You need to see it.""I mean, it did make me glad I have a bf already and don't have to deal with guys like in the movie but they are funny, attractive and charming.I didn't like Ellie who is a main character. She seemed disheveled and couldn't get a US accent just right the whole movie but everyone else was wonderful. Especially Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis), she was the icing on the Zac Efron, Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan cake. Yum.The movie definitely earned its R rating with swearing and adult scenes. Oh, and Zac Efron does in fact Rock Out with a large, strap-on (Blank) Out. For a good amount of time. So, be ready.There was a woman behind me talking the entire time. PEOPLE.

Maybe I had nothing better to do that day, maybe I was longing for a romantic flick, who knows? But I'm glad I did.I had an incredible time watching this film. All the lead actors seemed to be aware of the roles they were assigned to, and that lead to a very believable performance from each and every one of them. The story, though, was pretty predictable. The dialogues, however, wasn't. The friendship between the dudes was a very refreshing one since it wasn't dull, tedious, and forced. Their chemistry felt quite natural, smooth, and real.The romantic aspect was portrayed nicely that it never felt overdone or sappy; just enough to keep the viewers interested, with some odd humor thrown in between to keep the situation from getting mawkishly sentimental.So, if you're still dubious about watching this film, set your doubts aside and go watch it.

But after 38 minutes I myself had an awkward moment and decided to turn it off. Not one second I wanted to know what would happen next, I just lost my interest. I couldn't connect with the leads, I just didn't care anymore. And I never quit a movie, so I felt kind of bad about it. But watching it unfortunately felt like a waste of time. Probably I'm not the kind of audience they made it for, but even then it should be good enough to make me go along with the story. And it isn't.

I pretty much just wanted to punch Zac Efron in the face for 80 minutes or so, though the other two actors had some slightly redeeming roles (Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan) though not really. Nobody who just found out their wife has been banging another dude and wants a divorce is going to be that calm about it, and nonchalantly act like it never happened as he tries to woo her back over.

However it was pleasantly surprising. With realistic humor at every turn it reminded me of conversations that i would have amongst some of my own friends. The general realism of ""guy"" humor was so beautifully betrayed. It is undoubtable that Zach Efron has come a long way from that pop diva that starred in high school musical. Thankfuly his taste in women didn't go away either, with some of the best looking actresses i have seen in a under rated comedy movie.

The script was flimsy, and full of holes. The initial reason why Vera left Mikey rang hollow. Surely if you had a problem with your partners spontaneity, you would just tell them instead of requesting a divorce. And suddenly, after one act of spontaneous love making, they are on the road to recovery. I mean, how ridiculous is that. Just one of many, many examples of this foolish story.The acting was the pits; Zac Efron is just not a good enough actor to be leading man material. The rest didn't impress me much either.

84,contact-huntj,Zac Efron & The City,6,26 February 2014,"After proving his commercial potential as a teenage heartthrob in the past, Zac Efron has recently been progressing towards leading man status with headline roles in romantic drams such as 'The Lucky One' and 'Charlie St. Cloud'. 'That Awkward Moment', a 'Bridget Jones' for the contemporary man, challenges Efron to bring enough charisma to front a trio of main, male characters.However intentional, the film borrows its approach to musing on dating philosophy quite heavily from the female skewing HBO show 'Sex And The City', which while much more controversial, is very similar in its manner of raising a subtopic of relationship culture and incorporating it into each character's arc. 'That Awkward Moment' does this very successfully, and with it being a feature film, chooses one - somewhat - original, if not refreshing, topic and poses this as a conflict that tests each of the players individually, as well as their group dynamic. It doesn't quite earn its 'R' rating, however, and as such, regardless of whether the comparison is apt or not, fails to hit quite as hard or make as bold a statement as 'Sex And The City' did on a regular basis.With his character's development the main focus of the storyline, Efron is the glue that binds himself, Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan together. Teller is a rapidly rising star, fresh from his sadly overlooked turn in '21 And Over'. Making an equal bid for stardom is Imogen Poots, who certainly strives to make an impression here ahead of her busy slate of upcoming releases.It's far from profound - this is one instance where a hard 'R' would have been beneficial for a grittier product - but 'That Awkward Moment' is an enjoyable bromance comedy, and perhaps the first time men have been encouraged to support a relationship drama that represents their perspective. In light of that, however, it's also sadly predictable as it aims to satisfy a female demographic in its climax. Regardless, the film is surprisingly insightful, bringing us a relatable tale of dating strife from a cast fresh-faced enough for us to believe.",That Awkward Moment

Hot boy with attachment issues meets his perfect girl. They get to know each other and get on so well and fall in love. They fall out over something that he did and then get together in the end and live happily ever after. Also you have his two less attractive best friends. One is a jerkish comic relief and the other a serious straight edge guy who is in a serious relationship and is trying to overcome some kind of monotony. Which in the end he does overcome when he has a great epiphany, finds the girl with glasses and gets together with her. It's so cliché! When she came over to his house and was playing xbox with the guys I knew she would turn around to look at his with a cheesy big smile. I knew that when she rang him in the bar that her father was dead before the lead character told us. I also knew that the comic relief guy would end up with his female counterpart the moment I saw her and that they would end up fighting because he never told his friends they were dating because of the bet and he also has commitment issues. (note that I don't even know their names. I don't need to cause I don't care about them, they don't make me want to care.) Also the actors I feel should have been in their 30's to have those kinds of jobs and plot lines they seemed a little young that may have been another reason why I didn't connect with it.

Will they be able to manage? or will one of them start to develop feelings, and lose the challenge? Does anyone really care?It ends up being very run of the mill and unoriginal. The toilet humor offered a couple laughs (but more the ""Why did i even laugh at that"" type of laugh), but the leads come across as smug, unrealistic and full of themselves.

92,soccerplyr91,If you haven't seen this movie you gotta see it now!,10,27 April 2014,"I would like to give this movie a 10/10. This movie has both Miles teller and Zac Efron in the movie which I both think are great actors. It's the first movie that I have seen Michael B. Jordan play in which I think he did a fantastic job. I was disappointed not to see this movie in the theaters for that long. Looking forward to future films by these three actors. If you like comedy and movies with relationships then this is the movie you have to see. With all of the trailers I saw with this movie, I was glad to see that they didn't show all of the funny scenes. Although the peeing seen with Zac and Miles that I saw in the trailers was really funny. Again if you haven't seen this movie, now is the time to do so.",That Awkward Moment

94,comicboy6000,That Awkward moment when people don't appreciate a good film.,7,10 December 2014,"Now I know what you're probably thinking, you're looking through these and thinking that this film probably isn't particularly worth watching. Well, I'm here to tell that you're wrong. This film is full of so money laugh out loud moments even I was surprised. Unlike many Rom-coms I found that this film maintained it's hilarity right until the end whilst also maintaining the romantic aspect and broadening it if anything, something that I often feel is rare in a rom-com (by this I mean I usually feel that towards the end of the rom-com the comedy aspect is virtually abandoned to make way for a big swooping romantic ending). I most certainly recommend watching this film and feel that you will not regret it; additionally I felt that all the actors did and adequate job and fulfilled their roles rather well. I do hope you enjoy the film. :D",That Awkward Moment
95,BudweiserKing,Why this is the best film ever & why you need to see it!,10,26 April 2014,"Let's talk about things that matter: Not being there when you are needed, caffeine addiction, contrived sexual assurance, alcohol tolerance & blow job jokes. This is one of the best ensemble performances seen since ""Drinking Buddies,"" and what a masterpiece that was! Zac's hair is straight from ""There's Something About Mary"" and has us wondering about the true nature of gravity. They must have shot this movie upside-down to keep the bouffant properly coaxed. So for sheer special effects, this film is an Oscar nominee. The number of ""Efron Poses"" would put the latest GQ to shame, but the film also presents beautiful contemporary female characters, all of whom are more than willing to part with any semblance of self respect and dignity in order to be a liberated millennial... that is to say, she's cool with: booty calls, f*ck-buddies and metrosexual pretense. Soooooo..... Where is this going? From bar to bedroom, coffee shop to sex shop, million dollar loft to upscale Manhattan salon; this is where BudweiserKing has to bail, like the lead character in this Awkward Moment.The Producers really took a wild gamble on casting Zac for the lead roll... May the odds be ever in his favor.Check out The BudweiserKing review of the also awesome movie Drinking Buddies...",That Awkward Moment
96,s-quinn_2010,Pretty typical love story,6,10 February 2014,"While the movie is extremely anti-feminist, especially in the beginning, it's pretty entertaining and overall humorous. Zac Efron, Michael Jordan, & Miles Teller make a great trio, which definitely adds the humor and interest into the movie. Be warned, for those people planning on taking their under 17-year-olds to see it: there's a lot of sex and it's definitely rated R for a reason. However, overall I would say that the movie was cute and never really has a dull moment. It's pretty predictable but has a few curve balls thrown in there throughout. The reason I give it a 6 is because of its anti-feminist vibe in the beginning. It's similar to other movies in that it has a pretty typical, predictable ending, but still different. Would I pay to see it again in theaters? Probably not. But I will probably rent it and watch it one more time. Zac Efron & Miles Teller are adorable.",That Awkward Moment
97,briefcaseofblues,Underrated Film,8,30 September 2017,"I really enjoyed this movie. There are jokes and scenes in this that killed me. Great cast, acting, chemistry, score and production. I'd rate it a 7.5If you don't like the humor/style, you will know in a few minutes so worth checking out this underrated movie. The score fits beautifully with the film builds--a post-rock industrial feel but more present, telescoping the emotion with the flow of the film.",That Awkward Moment
98,tiff-fowler,"Personally, I loved it!",10,23 September 2014,"OK, so there were some parts when their morals were completely off but I still loved this movie! I loved that it was a comedy but at the same time it had its completely serious moments. And Zac Efron and Miles Teller shined in this movie. Especially Miles. He rocked in this movie. I love it when Miles does a comedy but has his serious moments like in The Spectacular Now. And Zac Efron. wow, Zac Efron. He really showed you that High School Musical is over. He really stepped up his game in this movie. And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. I've never seen him before but I really liked him in this movie. So, if you are looking for a funny, a little heartfelt, sometimes serious movie, this is the one for you. I would watch this movie again.",That Awkward Moment
99,gejst,Catching movie with awesome music,9,16 July 2014,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Maybe because I'm a guy in the late 20's juggling all the related questions or just the fact that I was hooked by the music within. Anyway I would definitely recommend this movie. It's not deeply emotional, but still centers around problems/decisions that everyone is dealing with.And its highly refreshing watching a movie without swimsuit models, but broads with a cool personality - although Addison Timlin (best remembered for Californication) without a doubt, is truly smoking ;) /Thomas",That Awkward Moment
100,criticalcrass,A perfect blend of romantic and comedy,8,1 February 2014,"What appealed to me about the film was that, from the trailer, it didn't appear to be just another cheesy, cute love story. And it's not. I liked this film--the characters, the comedy, the conflict. This cast and crew delivered. It's refreshing and touching and genuine. I was most pleased with Miles Teller and Mackenzie Davis' performances. Teller sort of reminded me of John Cusack, only better. It's like Cusack's always aware of the camera. Teller doesn't care that it's there. He's just gonna go do his thing. These guys look like they had a lot of fun filming this movie. Try it. You might like it.",That Awkward Moment
101,ck228,Enjoyable,7,20 July 2014,"I was discouraged when I saw the low ratings for this film, but thankfully I had already started watching it. It is definitely not comparable laughter-wise to movies such as This Is The End or 21 & 22 Jump Street, but it is very good. The type of humor may not be for everyone, but I found it to be very relatable. The way the jokes were delivered is how my friends and I joke most often. The actors in it were great and the story moved at a nice pace. Miles Teller was great and I now look forward to his work in the future, Imogen Poots was lovely and Zac Efron was great as always. I don't think Efron gets as much credit as he deserves. It portrays a few different likely dating situations that people could find themselves In these days. I would say it's more for twenty-something's than any other age group. If you are at all curious about this movie I say you should give it a shot!",That Awkward Moment
102,swing_love_girl,Loved it!,8,31 May 2017,"I've probably seen this movie over twenty times already, and every time I love it even more. It's so refreshing that it's not your typical romantic comedy with a pretty girl and a handsome guy who fall in love. The characters are so much more relatable and the humour and jokes are similar to the ones I find in my own group of friends. They chose the perfect actors for the characters and you can see they actually enjoyed filming it. My favorite part might be the bloopers after the credits; they crack me up every time. I would totally recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good laugh and doesn't want to watch something too serious.",That Awkward Moment
103,victoria-hpa,Watch this movie.,8,31 January 2014,Just because some people do not have a sense of humor that does not make a movie a disaster. This was one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a full Theatre where every one were laughing their hearts out. Do not Listen to the people who are just mean have nothing. better to do and when a movie shows them how life can be they get mad. Choose this movie i recommend it! Funny romantic dramatic Hilarious A real Comedy. Zac Efron was really good i this movie as well as all the cast was well selected. So what I am trying to say here is that you definitely need to take you significant other or your friends or both and do not hesitate.

There's no story behind it; the whole movie is pointless and just trying to fill up the minutes. It's more of a 5 minute documentary. I couldn't find the comedy in it at all and I'm a sucker for any movie labeled comedy. I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half watching it! What's sad is that good actors are involved in such work. I mean Zac Efron and Milles Teller have had their share of good movies. I even played Candy Crush in the movies. Candy Crush was more exciting than this soft-core porn! All in all, I advice you all to go to a funeral or start a sewing hobby, probably more fun than this.",That Awkward Moment

I don't know who decided to call it a comedy, but it isn't. I should have demanded my money back. I'm so sad to think that films stoop to this level. I can only assume the target audience are very young impressionable kids. No one else would watch this trash, at least I sincerely hope not. My date didn't research the movie, we just thought a nice comedy would be fun. Mistake. And talk about an awkward moment on our first date !! I felt so bad for him. Luckily he is a gentleman and got me the heck outta there !! We will be sure to be very careful and research the movie before going in the future. Actually it's a shame we have to do that.

106,syork603,Worth a watch,8,15 February 2014,"OK so I pre-booked this movie before looking it up on IMDb or seeing any trailers for it. I just read the description and thought it might be a nice, light Saturday night movie. Then, I went on to IDMB and saw that the average rating was 6.1/10. Uh - oh.But I was definitely pleasantly surprised. That Awkward Moment (or Are We Dating Yet, as it's called in Australia) is a rom-com about three guys who make a pact not to date anyone after one of them gets a divorce after a seemingly happy relationship. Eventually they all get into pretty sticky situations and it gets a little, well, awkward. But it was funny, a bit dirty and a little off- beat. It made me laugh, it made me a cry (just a little bit) but mostly it just made me really enjoy it. The characters were great, all of them likable in their own way. You felt for all of them and they were the kind of people that you wanted to hang out with.OK sure, it had its flaws; it went a little off track at times, the conflict was a little too short and easily resolved, and the ending was a bit typical for me, but it wasn't intended to be a serious drama that makes you think, it's just meant to be something fun and light. I just felt compelled to write this review because I feel like the other reviews are giving it a bad rap and people are going to be deterred just from reading those reviews. It's not terrible, it's a funny, light offbeat kind of movie and if that's what you feel like watching, then I say go for it, because I found it really enjoyable.",That Awkward Moment

My girlfriend and I laughed (not just chuckled) along with the audience laughed from start to finish. This movie was funny, witty and very well written. Story line was very interesting and kept your attention the entire time. As 2 other movie critics used to say ""2 THUMBS UP"" Be your own critic and don't rely on anyone else. P.S. Stay for the outtakes very funny also. Michael B Jordan is a brilliant actor (check out Fruitvale Station)Never heard of Miles Teller, but he was also really good and entertaining.

108,Cbhfb,I haven't wanted to leave a movie half an hour into it before.,2,1 February 2014,"""That Awkward Moment"" was appropriately named, as most of the movie was scripted, forced, and cliché. As a 23 year old female, I was actually insulted that this is what Hollywood thinks is interesting or relevant to my demographic. It seems as though people this age have been dumbed down to toilet humor, drinking, cursing, and casual sex. The plot line was so uninteresting and predictable that had I would have been more intrigued watching an episode of Barney. It almost seemed like it had elements of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" that went horribly wrong, especially because of the lack of character development. The plot even fell short of the cliché I was expecting, as at least 2 of the characters never had that magical moment where they realize the wrongs of their ways and mature. They were the same, stagnant personalities all the way through the film, the only things that changed were their relationship statuses. Having three main characters with their own stories, the film had at least a 1 in 3 chance of making an intriguing story line. Instead, the plot walked the already worn out path of the traditional romantic comedy script. To make things even more painful, the comedic timing was so off that even elements that could have been funny (the coworker Fred) were just awkward and odd. The overuse of ""f---"" added to the awkwardness as you could just tell that random cursing was interjected into lines, maybe to make it more ""youthful."" Jordan's character, Mikey, was the character that I found most bearable, as he seemed to have some sort of dignity or depth. Daniel, played by Miles Teller, literally made me cringe with anger at his nonchalant crassness, reminding me of that guy in high school who tries to be funny but has no intelligence to back it up. Apparently, repeatedly telling a girl that you are ""the best b--- j-- receiver"" is endearing(?). Efron was completely unlikable and never really redeemed himself or matured, making the film feel empty and unfinished. Overall, ""Awkward"" checked all the boxes of a basic romantic comedy, including all of the wrong, stereotypically youthful ones. The only thought I left with was wondering how Efron's character could afford such a nice apartment.",That Awkward Moment
109,jordan-r-pasco,Efron brilliantly displays the inside workings of the male brain,6,10 February 2014,"I thought this movie was good in terms of entertainment, but not anything special by way of movie making. It was comical, but also had a serious undertone to it. For anyone interested in learning how guys think, this movie is a must-see. Although it isn't what every male thinks, the movie captures the essence of the male psych. My favorite part was when Efron finally realized the true meaning of love. However, I find if unrealistic that she would forgive him after he ditched her father's funeral. The movie does an excellent job of explaining love. Males and females clearly differ in their versions of love, however one common factor remains. True love involves being there for you partner, and in life that's all you can ask for.",That Awkward Moment
110,jefsother,Started out weak... but Became great!,8,16 February 2014,"The movie was great! . It was more revealing than it needed to be. Very little was left to the imagination except for the dialog. They really mean rated R. The movie is a typical scenario among good male friends. Some of the different themes in the movie remind you of familiar relationships of all sorts of stories. However there was some real surprises in this one with many witty lines. Many of the situations were unique and original. In an era where ninety percent of the films are unoriginal duplicates of super-heroes, wars, cops and robbers, and pathetic horror movies and aliens, it's nice to finely see another romance/comedy hit the theater. This film is very romantic and comical. Yes there is some ""sick"" parts, but then again this is not a Sinatra romance movie. No one left early when we saw it and I think most everyone left with a smile. I know we did! The right actors were chosen for all the parts. We enjoyed this film and will see it again on video, certainly without the kids.",That Awkward Moment
111,lovinloz,Awesome heartfelt Rom com,10,2 March 2014,We went to see this without reading reviews or watching any shorts. This movie is awesome! We laughed the whole way through. I went with a male - 20 years old and he also enjoyed it. I am disappointed reading all of these bad reviews!I have seen much worse! I can't wait to see it again! A chick flick based around guys! We need more of these as it has the element of humor :-) Zac of course is cute as ever. Daniel is HILARIOUS! He seriously needs to be in more movies. I found this movie uplifting and was a great way to spend a rainy Saturday night. I definitely recommend this movie. It was fantastic. The whole audience laughed throughout the movie and I did not see anyone get up and leave part way through the movie (as mentioned in some earlier reviews)....,That Awkward Moment

I advise everyone should be their own judge. i highly enjoyed it. My reasons for rating it only a 6 out of 10 was simply because i believe that some of the plot could have been slightly different, maybe the situations could have been thought out better. But, the acting was good and I thought the film was pretty funny. My favorite character wasn't even Zac Efrons character it was Miles Teller who played Daniel. He was hilarious! So i suggest you watch the movie before judging everyones opinion and reviews. I strongly disagree with rating it a 1 or a 2 like most people did.",That Awkward Moment

I was outvoted, but we all agreed afterwards that it was a waste of time. Zac Efron has done some good movies (The Lucky One and Neighbors) but this one was a dud. The writing was terrible, and the movie just went nowhere. Miles Teller was by far the worst actor in this film. I have never seen this guy in a movie before, but he should look for another profession. There was no plot in this movie. The scenes just seemed random. This was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last year. Definitely not worth renting or buying.",That Awkward Moment
114,lexifinkle,Surprisingly good,9,31 December 2014,"After reading multiple poor reviews I had to convince my husband (and myself) to watch this movie. I'm really glad I did. I found most of the delivery of jokes and humor, in general, to be really natural and relatable - conversations that I think I've actually experienced with my friends. Despite the chauvinistic portrayal of all the male characters I didn't find myself disliking any of them, which, I think, is a compliment to the acting and the actors ability to demonstrate innocence and vulnerability during pivotal parts. Some of it was kind of formulaic, but duh! It's a brom-com about late 20-something's. And I completely disagree with criticisms that none of the characters seemed to have any chemistry. There were times, watching Teller and Davis, that I totally forgot that I was watching actors and felt more like I was spying on an actual couple. Haters gonna hate.",That Awkward Moment
115,ChrisMatthews117,Stop Overthinking,8,5 August 2014,"Many previous reviewers and posters have all had some form of disdain for this movie. This disdain ranges from the way they look at the movie. Honestly if you didn't enjoy it, you weren't in the right frame of mind. As an individual recently out of a relationship I found this movie to be exactly what I needed. The three friends present all face relationship dilemmas and manage to come out on top. Yes the movie is a bit slow to build, but so to is life after a relationship failure. From my perspective (which varies from others I am aware) I found this movie to be highly entertaining and just what I needed. It might not be what you need in life right now, or maybe just didn't appeal to you at all, but I personally found the movie to be humorous and thoroughly enjoyable.",That Awkward Moment

Obviously not to be taken too seriously!",7,14 December 2014,"That awkward moment is a normal title which could describe dating in general and all the things that come with it and for a romantic comedy to be emotional and funny then Tom Gormican got his debut right.I had all the scepticism of every romantic comedy I have watched but this film surpassed them all and it could even be a modern pretty woman. Each actor had a fulfilling parts and equally intellectual and funny to go with it. I connected with all the actors / actresses and for that I respect the director and producer in this production. Zach Efron has really shown that he is a consistent actor and co-director and IMHO he is getting it right every time. Miles Teller is proving to be a deep thoughtful romantic in these roles as in the spectacular now and Imogen Poots also fits this role. There is a definite beginning where the old college pals promise to stay single and enjoy all the NYC girls, middle, where each think they can control natural emotions and admit to themselves they can't and ending where they all become happy in love (romantic comedy format )but each part had substance, comedy, emotion and intellect. There is a part in the middle of the film where Zach shows up dressed up in the wrong dress code for the wrong dress up Party which has been seen many times but never better than in this film. If you are in a mood for a romantic comedy, pick this one now and you might enjoy it like I did.?",That Awkward Moment
117,miteshsoni-19794,Too shallow for my liking,6,19 August 2016,"First off it wasn't a bad movie, it just never really got going. I enjoyed the premise and like the actors but things were just a little too shallow and unrealistic in the way sequences fell into place. Serious issues were resolved with a smile and some choice words when in reality there should have been a little more heart and depth in its place. All in all a decent if unremarkable romcom, good for when you don't want something too intellectual and are happy to watch the beautiful Imogen Poots. Some scenes drew genuine laughter and the chemistry worked in some instances so its not all bad and i don't think a complete waste of time as you might see in some other recent movies nowadays.",That Awkward Moment

I didn't necessarily like the way Michael's storyline ended, they could've done a lot more with that. Also feel like the endings of the other two storylines were kind of predictable.
