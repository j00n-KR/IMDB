0,Leofwine_draca,Horribly dated,3,7 October 2013,"I'm mildly interested in 1980s-era teen comedies, but REVENGE OF THE NERDS is no PORKY'S. In fact it's a horribly dated comedy, with an ultra-lame script that relies on tired, overstated gags and unpleasant sexist comedy. I didn't laugh once, or enjoy any particular scene. Yes, it really is that poorly conceived.The movie is almost entirely plot less. It consists of a couple of nerds, played by Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards (later of E.R. fame) who go to a new college, join up with other nerds, and have various encounters with the jocks. For much of the running time they perve on naked women and trick others into having sex with them. It's misogynistic, and fairly unpleasant.Unfortunately, the film is just too stupid to make more of an impact or to allow oneself to get offended by it. There are lots of famous faces in the cast, from John Goodman to Bernie Casey and one ""Jamie"" Cromwell, but none of them have a lot to work with. The fault with the movie is the script, which was clearly written by somebody with a sense of humour vastly different to my own...",Revenge of the Nerds
1,SnoopyStyle,Movie for the Nerd Universe,8,30 January 2014,"Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert Lowell (Anthony Edwards) are two nerds starting their college life at Adams. When the football jocks burn down their own house, they take over the freshman dorm. Lewis, Gilbert, and other nerds have no place to go when no fraternity is willing to take them. So they get their own run down house.This is the ultimate underdog movie. The characters are memorable icons of nerd-dom. Lewis's laugh, Booger, Lamar's javelin throw, and Ogre's nerd cry are all unforgettable. It's a simple and sweet movie with a loving message. The characters are strictly broad stereotypes. However the actors are able to give real human emotions to the nerds. It has moments of Porky's, and moments of Animal House.",Revenge of the Nerds
2,Prismark10,Frat packs,5,16 February 2017,"A follow up to a scene from Animal House where everyone who was not a white, good looking jock were not deemed to be the right sort to join the frat house.Louis and Gilbert are high school friends who are heading for college but are soon branded nerds and hence outsiders. When the football jocks burn their own building down the nerds are kicked out from their own dormitory and and forced to live in the gymnasium.After constant bullying and humiliation from the jocks they form their own fraternity and ally themselves with an accredited, mainly black college who accepts them and are able to renovate a rundown campus houseThis means they can take their grievance to the their own college council but are again stonewalled by the jocks who run it and then challenge them at the Greek Games where the nerds use their cunning and brain power to get one up on the jocks.Like a lot of 1980s comedies of this type, it has bimbos, tits and arse, 80s music, stereotypes but its heart is in the right place as the geeks fight back against the bullies.It is not a great film but a fun, silly film with a lot of actors who went on to become familiar faces such as James Cromwell, John Goodman and Anthony Green.",Revenge of the Nerds
3,lee_eisenberg,I'm PROUD to be a nerd,10,9 May 2005,"I first saw ""Revenge of the Nerds"" when I was ten (that's right, ten). Some people at school had been making fun of me, calling me a nerd. After I saw ""ROTF"", I was finally proud to call myself a nerd (albeit not one who wears glasses, has buck teeth, and has his pant legs halfway up his calves).It's especially great that the nerds were such a diverse group of people (Booger may have been gross, but he clearly had a brain).And there's also an interesting thing about the cast. Robert Carradine must be the only person who has co-starred with both Jane Fonda (he played the brother in ""Coming Home"") and with the guy who played Booger. And I never realized that Stan was played by the same guy who played Roger on ""Happy Days"".So, if you're any kind of individual who has spent his/her life getting bullied, this is the movie for you!",Revenge of the Nerds
4,Woodyanders,Still a riot after all these years,8,7 August 2009,"Geeky Louis Skolnick (the excellent Robert Carradine) and his awkward best friend Gilbert Lowell (an equally fine Anthony Edwards) find themselves the odd men out at Adams College. Louis, Gilbert, and a bunch of fellow academic misfits start their own fraternity. When the jocks fiercely persecute the quirky frat, our nerdy heroes decide it's time to fight back against their cool, yet cruel oppressors. Directing Jeff Kanew, working from a bright and witty script Steve Zacharias and Jeff Buhai, relates the lively story at a constant zippy pace, stages a bunch of amusing throwaway gags with considerable aplomb, and maintains an infectiously good-natured tone throughout. Granted, we get the expected dope gags and leering female nudity, but fortunately the humor manages to stay on the right side of raunchy and raucous without ever becoming too crass or sleazy. Moreover, the appealing cast play their parts with tremendous energy and enthusiasm: Carradine and Edwards make for utterly engaging leads, with tip-top support from Ted McGinley as hateful head jock Stan Gable, Julie Montgomery as stuck-up cheerleader Betty Childs, Curtis Armstrong as blithely disgusting slob Booger, Larry B. Scott as merry open homosexual Lamar Latrell, Timothy Busfield as dweeby violinist Arnold Poindexter, Andrew Cassese as precious little squirt Harold Wormser, Brian Tochi as the bumbling Takashi, Donald Gibb as fearsome behemoth Ogre, Bernie Casey as hip sponsor U.N. Jefferson, John Goodman as the bullish Coach Harris, and David Wohl as the meek Dean Ulich. James Cromwell pops up in a nifty minor role as Louis' dorky dad Mr. Skolnick. Comic highlights include the nerds' disastrous frat party, a rowdy panty raid, Booger always cheating at cards with Takashi, Booger's monstrous belch, and the nerds performing a simply amazing song and dance routine at a talent show (complete with funky rap singing and gnarly break dancing!). Best of all, there's even a positive central message about standing up for yourself and being proud of who you are. Both King Baggot's polished cinematography and Thomas Newman's bouncy score are up to par. A real gut-buster.",Revenge of the Nerds
5,BandSAboutMovies,Troubling.,7,22 November 2017,"Best friends and nerds Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine, son of ""skinny Dracula"" John Carradine and brother of David Carradine) and Gilbert Lowe (Anthony Edwards) are excited to attend Adams College, but are instantly kicked out of their dorm by the Alpha Betas, who have burned their house down. Sleeping on cots in the gym, they find other like-minded misfits and decide to create their own fraternity.The film follows the 80's comedy blueprint: a simple premise is stated, then hijinks ensue. Here, it is: ""Nerds go to school and fight jocks, then hijinks ensue.""Battling Alpha Betas Stan (Ted McGinley, he who has caused many a TV show to ""Jump the Shark""), Burke (Matt Salinger, son of J.D. and star of 1990's Captain America) and Ogre (Donald Gibb, Ray Jackson from Bloodsport), our Nerds overcome adversity and become a probationary Tri-Lamb fraternity. Ironically, Lambda Lambda Lambda has always been an all-black frat. And the boys only have one black member, the stereotypically gay Lamar.That means that Tri-Lamb president U.N. Jefferson (Bernie Casey from Gargoyles!) has to come visit the boys. They throw a party that is boring until Booger's (Curtis Armstrong) drugs get involved — welcome to the 80's — and everyone loses their inhibitions. However, the jocks disrupt their party, leading to Jefferson coming around to the guys as he senses discrimination.The Nerds take their titular revenge by conducting a panty raid and putting liquid heat into the jock straps of the football team, leading to Jefferson making them a real frat. However, the harassment can never stop while Stan is the President of the Greek Council. So the Nerds need to win the Greek Games during homecoming so that they get a vote — which they do so via a combination of their intelligence, more drugs and some questionable decisions (more on those in a bit). Oh yeah — and there's also an 80's synth music number.The jocks trash the Nerds house, but Gilbert decides to speak up at a pep rally. The dean, U.N. Jefferson and a group of big black Tri-Lambs stand up for him and the Nerds ask all the disenfranchised in the audience to join them. The dean tells the jocks that they have to give up their house until the damage to the Tri-Lambs house is fixed, saying, ""You're jocks, go live in the gym."" Everyone celebrates. The end.Except, well, there are some troubling moments.What bonds the Nerds and brings them together? A panty raid, as the boys descend on the Pi Delta Pi sorority house, stealing panties, chasing women and placing video cameras, through which the boys watch the women while they go about their daily lives. In the 80's, this was considered a prank. Today, we'd call it rape. But it gets worse. Much worse.In the Greek Games, a pie-selling contest determines much of the final score. The Nerds win by using nude photos of Betty (Julia Montgomery, The Kindred) under the crust of their pies. Again, this is abhorrent behavior. But it gets worse.There's also a kissing booth, where Lewis attempts to make his move on Betty. She is replaced with a large, unattractive woman, showing that even the Nerds place an emphasis on physical versus internal beauty, no matter what hardships that very same prejudice has put them through. Then, Lewis steals Stan's costume and tricks Betty into having sex with him. Yes, the hero of this movie knowingly ignores consent to have sex. This is pure and simple rape. This isn't a snowflake looking back on a fun remnant of our pop culture past. This scene has bothered me since I first watching this film on VHS. Even worse, Betty falls instantly in love with her rapist, asking him if all Nerds are this good in bed.I haven't even gotten into the racism of the film, which posits all Japanese as horny photograph taking morons through the Takashi character. That said, Brian Tochi, the actor who played Takashi, is credited ""for breaking the barriers and opening doors for East Asian people in entertainment in the U.S., and advancing the perception that Oriental actors have the ability to portray more mainstream roles."" Those mainstream roles also include Cadet Tomoko ""Elvis"" Nogata in the Police Academy films, who acts just as ridiculous as Takashi (but doesn't have his own corny Asian theme song). Or just how stereotypically gay Lamar is.But to me, the worst sin of the film is that when the Nerds win, instead of treating their opponents with the care that they never received and teaching everyone an important lesson, they instead relegate the jocks back to the fate they had once suffered. No one learns anything. The cycle repeats and now the jocks become the Nerds who have become the jocks. This reminds me of how insular societies — wrestling fans, comic book lovers — can be more hate-filled and clique obsessed than their worst perceived enemies.Read more at http://bit.ly/2A4SBqO",Revenge of the Nerds

7,Scarecrow-88,Revenge of the Nerds,8,17 November 2006,"Watching NERDS again just proved that despite it's lovingly exploitive attitude, the jokes(albeit perhaps dated after 20 years)reflecting the on-going nerd culture as computers were becoming the key for the success of very intelligent people who dress and act a bit different are what make it so appealing. I think it's a time-capsule teen comedy when the formula worked and well. The film is based in stereotyping, but that is another one of it's appealing traits. It's easy for us who never really felt we belonged in the popular set to side with the victimized nerds for they represent the lonely-hearts who bask in the giant hurdled insult. The film, despite hurling those insults, engagingly loves these nerds and I think that's another key to the film's success. We can understand that without the wonderful performances from the cast portraying the nerds that this film just couldn't fly. The film is also so immersed in 80's pop culture that it is an amusing memory to dredge back up.The film shows the jocks as cretins pretty much abusive in every way. They step over the nerds because they deem themselves superior because of what they have externally than internally. We can see that they have to depend on what they have on the outside(brawn and good-looks)because the nerds completely overwhelm them on the inside. Carradine as Louis and Edwards as Gilbert are definitely the spark plug for the film and are so wonderful and likable, the material looks better. Then you have the gross-out jokes that worked well for Belushi in ""Animal House"" in this film represented by Curtis Armstrong's Booger who burps loudest and picks his nose the deepest. And, he can hurl one mean hilarious insult. His quips are the most funniest. Then you have Timothy Busfield as the elder Poindexter who seems to be the most clumsiest nerd of the bunch who sure has a hard time with the robotic maid. You have Larry Scott as the homosexual Lamar where the humorous gay jokes fly. Ted McGinley is the prick leader of the Alpha Beta jocks and Donald Gibb is The Ogre(who probably would be considered a nerd if he wasn't so massive). Then there's the oh-so yummy Betty Childs who is McGinley's girl but falls in love with Louis after she discovers how good nerds actually are at sex.There's this non-PC attitude that reigns supreme as full frontal nudity is in heavy doses and many of the jokes would indeed be considered offensive. But, it comes down to seeing the nerds out-shine and out-last those jocks that leaves us particularly satisfied.",Revenge of the Nerds
8,Hey_Sweden,Upbeat fun for fans of 80s raunch-comedies.,8,11 March 2020,"The title lays it right out for you: the story is about a group of outcasts at Adams College who use their brains to devise ways of getting back at their brawnier counterparts. Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards are engaging as freshmen Lewis and Gilbert, who rally their fellow nerds to reign supreme over the boorish jocks on campus.A first-rate ensemble - Tim Busfield, Larry B. Scott, Curtis Armstrong, Andrew Cassese, Brian Tochi, etc. - have a ball with their colourful roles, with Armstrong often stealing his scenes as the crass ""Booger"". The cast also includes the lovely Julia Montgomery, Ted McGinley as obnoxious jock Stan Gable, future star John Goodman as the coach, Matt Salinger (J.D.'s son), James Cromwell as Lewis' affable dad, and the hilarious Donald Gibb as the imposing ""Ogre"". Bernie Casey has a great role as U.N. Jefferson, the leader of a fraternity to which the nerds apply for membership.""Revenge of the Nerds"" is built on a formula, to be sure, but there's often something to be said for these time-honoured scenarios where we root for the underdogs to win in the end. It earns its R rating with use of profanity and nudity, but it's all done in a very good-natured way, with director Jeff Kanew and the screenwriters never lingering too long on unpleasantness.A hip 80s soundtrack helps everything go down quite easily. The finale where the nerds perform a catchy pop ditty is definitely a highlight, although our protagonists' raid on a sorority house is also quite memorable. The movie gets down to business quickly and rarely offers a let-up until the final embracing of nerd status. It has some funny lines, with Booger tending to get most of the best ones.Followed by three sequels (one theatrical, two made for TV), and a busted pilot for a proposed series.Eight out of 10.",Revenge of the Nerds
9,preppy-3,You don't have to be a nerd to love this movie,8,25 May 2010,"Two computer nerds--Lewis (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert (Anthony Edwards)--have trouble in college because of a fraternity of sadistic jocks. But, they get their revenge. That's about it for the plot but this movie is fun! I was in college when I saw this and I was nerd so I immediately identified with the characters (although I'm not anywhere near as nerdy as these guys). Yeah, they're gross (Booger), dress funny and almost all wear glasses but they have brains and intelligence and fight back (and win) WITHOUT using violence. I knew this movie was going to be fun when you see the title appear during the 20th Century Fox intro music (like it was some big important movie). Then when Carradine laughed early on--the movie had me. His laugh is infectious...and hysterical! Thankfully they don't overuse it--it's just in enough to remain funny. Also the acting is good all around. Carradine and Edwards are great and it's fun to see Ted McGinley before ""Married...with Children"" and John Goodman before ""Roseanne"". Also there's James Cromwell (yes--THAT James Cromwell billed as Jamie Cromwell) in a small role. Yes, the film is far from perfect. There's the expected gross-out jokes, sexism, gratuitous female nudity and dead spots but you have to expect it in a film like this. Also there's a few unexpected laughs when you see the ancient computers these guys use! A surprise hit in its day. Best line--""That nerd saw me naked!"" An 8.",Revenge of the Nerds
10,Uriah43,Nerds Looking for a Place to Call Their Own,7,12 November 2021,"This film begins with two high school students by the names of ""Lewis Skolnick"" and ""Gilbert Lowe"" on their way to become freshmen at Adams College. However, when a nearby fraternity comprised of football athletes known as the Alpha Betas carelessly burn down their own house their head coach demands the same building where Skolnick and Lowe are currently residing. And because the dean is easily intimidated, he does exactly what the coach says and orders everyone currently living there to be temporarily housed in the local gym until they can find a fraternity of their own. Some are taken in but all of those identified as nerds are left on their own. Unfortunately, it doesn't end there because once Skolnick, Lowe and the rest find a dilapidated house and fix it up, the Alpha Betas continue to harass them and continue to make life as difficult as possible. So, realizing that they are defenseless without a fraternity of their own, they petition every national one available-but they are subsequently turned down because they are nerds. Then one day they finally come across one that cannot refuse them-a national black fraternity known as Lambda Lambda Lambda-and things become quite interesting after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I enjoyed this film when it first came out and--even though it isn't quite as funny as I remembered--it still has some good laughs here and there and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Revenge of the Nerds
11,Aaron1375,I think it would have been a bit more realistic if it was set in high school.,6,4 December 2011,"My guess the reason this film was set in college rather than high school was the fact they wanted to have a few nude scenes here and there and they did not want to depict high school girls in such a manner. I will be the first to say college is a place that like high school, has a kind of hierarchy that is unfair. However, while coaches do make money and have some pull, they are not going to literally run a college campus, nor or smart kids, or nerds going to be tormented to this degree. Snubbed, yes, but I just did not see the name calling and such like depicted in the film when I was at college. To many older students, people who are middle aged so things like that are not going to happen as much. Now I do see a lot of the things happening in this film being like a high school cause I myself faced things like seen here during my time in high school. If only I could go back now and relive it at the size I am now, I would enjoy ripping the arms out of my fellow students' sockets. Or when one of them came up to me and said 'remember me', it was permissible by law to smash their faces in. Why did I have to become big and strong enough to destroy people at an age when it is frowned upon? Sigh...I digress, this film looks at a couple of guys starting their time in a college where they are sure things are going to be different. Well it is not, but during the course of the film, the nerds of the film do things that are just as bad as what the jocks do. There are some funny scenes, but at times one thinks that it is going to far such as tricking a girl to have sex with you, I guarantee she is not going to be as pleasant upon finding out the deception as she had here. There is also the idiotic robot, I do care how smart they are, they are not going to build a fully functional robot capable of the things this one is depicted as doing. Still, I liked the nerds trying to join a fraternity, liked the competition, the movie does have some funny things. It also has stuff that makes no sense, seriously why is Booger one of the nerds? A guy who drinks and acts crude is the type of guy every fraternity has in spades.",Revenge of the Nerds
12,Wuchakk,Entertaining early 80's school comedy,7,26 December 2014,"In 1984's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" a group of social outcasts at Adams College are persecuted by fraternities of jocks and popular girls. To defend themselves they form their own fraternity and use their brains to outwit their enemies.""Revenge"" is over three decades old now and has formulated a decent reputation, as far as school/college comedies go. The film works because it's amusing enough and -- despite the youthful inanities and occasional raunch -- the viewer starts to care about the outcasts and their cause; we celebrate when they have a victory over the pompous crowd. There's some nudity so stay away if that turns you off.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Tucson, Arizona.GRADE: B",Revenge of the Nerds
13,The_Void,"Lacking, even for this sort of movie",6,9 June 2005,"One sub-genre that was popular in the decade of kitsch; the 1980's, was teen comedy. This is a good or a bad thing depending on which side of the fence you're on, but whatever side; this isn't a particularly good example. As a big hater of Animal House, me writing this review begs the question ""why did you bother?"" The answer to that is probably because I liked the title. It has a fun ring to it, and I reckoned that a title like that should spawn a good film. While the film isn't essentially 'bad', it does have a strong scent of deja vu following it around, and while I aren't a guru on the subject of teen comedies; even I have seen the stuff in this movie before. It's got all the clichés, from all the kids getting stoned to the geeky kid getting off with the hottest babe in the school. The plot, as you might expect, is paper thin; and it follows the story of a couple of nerds that move to a new college and immediately find themselves at the mercy of a fraternity of football 'jocks', who see fit to tease the nerds because they're nerds.This film came to my attention after the nerdy character in American Splendor gave it such high praise. From the way he described it, I was expecting something in the way of intelligence and maybe even characters that you can identify with. I don't know, maybe real life nerds who went to college in America will find the events of this film similar to events in real life and will therefore find this uplifting or whatever, but for a non-American schooled, non-nerd; there isn't all that much to like. Some of the jokes are funny, such as the 'cool' nerd's poker skills against a less savvy player, but many of them are silly in a not-very-good way. Younger audiences will almost certainly enjoy the nudity that the film features, along with some of the more childish jokes; but for the serious cinema buffs amongst us (me included), this is lacking even for an 80's teen comedy.",Revenge of the Nerds
14,mm-39,Nerds!!!!Nerds!!!!Nerds!!!!,8,2 May 2002,"I love this movie; it is a true classic.  It is dated, and one has to understand the 80's macho, old beer commercial perfect, women magnet type of guy attitude of the time.  Forget the Boy bands of today, the macho jocks would have chased these wimps out of the school dance!  Unless you had some slick political skills or played a mean axe (guitar for those not from the 80's) the top of the food chain ruled.  Talk about computers, bad dress, or social slowness labelled you a nerd.    Now the computer geeks rule in 00's; there is true revenge.  The movie like animal house looks very dated.  Animal house has been copied too death to the point that the shock value is gone, and so is the humor.  The heros of animal house are viewed as the jerks of today for whoever had their childish pranks pulled on them.  Animal house led the evolution for revenge of the Nerds, where the pranksters became the norm and picked on the nerds. The dated part is where the social out casts get sympathy, where now a days people worry that the weird nerd could go nuts.  They have a Walton's joke that no one would get know, and a couple of the nerds would fit in today's grung or PC crowd.  The part that keeps this film on top is the writing. What the nerds lack in social skills, looks, and muscles they make up in brains.  They get their revenge on the Jocks, with some dated non PC tactics that make me laugh.  In the end, I love the part where they yell Nerds!!! Nerds!! and one of them say, ""who are they talking too?"" 8/10.",Revenge of the Nerds

But you let go and have a lot of fun with it. Finally, after everything I heard about this movie, I got to see it. I have to say it's a little over rated, but you get your laughs. I did like the scene where the girl has had the kinks with the nerd, but she thought it was her boyfriend in costume, and she was so amazed, even when she found out, and he said ""All jocks think about is sports, but nerds always think about sex"". That's probably true, LOL. The ending is more heart warming then funny. But like I said, it's a decent comedy. And it is considered a classic among many. So, give it a shot.

There's just nothing too particularly good either. It's gotten to the point where I've seen so many movies I'm always looking for something really unique.This just didn't have it. I was told that most popular 80's movies had topless women in it and that was even true was this! I guess it was a thing back then. The characters/actors are nice and likeable enough.

18,lesleyharris30,"Not the 80's Comedy Gold one myth hope for, but still quite Funny,",6,27 July 2015,"Revenge of the Nerds is a decent movie with a fairly well developed storyline and a good comedic cast. It certainly has lots of great moments, there are many scenes that had me laughing out loud, it's characters all have very different personalities which makes for some terrific moments, the soundtrack is also fantastic, offering some pure eighties music. The film has the same problem several films from the eighties have, and that's that they forget about the story or set up of the movie on several occasions and just get carried away with themselves making jokes and offering slapstick images for the audience, this can get irritating at times as it will leave you wanting the story to move forward some more, also because of the constant comedy, it becomes hard to care and sympathise with the main characters. It's called Revenge of the Nerds, but I don't feel like the ""revenge"" is ever fully realised, even the ending dosen't offer a complete closure to the story and let the audience know that the jocks have gotten their just desserts and the nerds now reign superior, it wasn't a clear or fitting finale. It's quite funny at times, but I don't think Revenge of the Nerds deserves to be considered one of the great comedy movies of the eighties, but it is certainly worth the watch if you ever see it on television.

19,Irishchatter,Everyone is a nerd!,8,6 January 2016,"I really enjoyed the movie but it stereotypically targeted people who are smart, weak and dresses plainly. I mean, anyone can get bullied regardless of what you look like or act towards people especially when it comes with personality. Also for being a bad guy, you most likely be the one who likes doing rough sports and looking down on people. Sure, anyone can be bully especially smart people if they tried! That's just my opinion on movies like this.Moving on, I honestly didn't know John Goodman got involved in this movie and boy, he looked fine for being an average weight man. This was like before he became really heavy but still, he's a great actor! I liked how in the end, Soriaty girl Betty Childs and Lewis finally became a couple.

This is by far the best of the lot. I have a weakness for cheesy 80's films. For some reason, I'm in love with the 80's, especially movies. Everything was so simple back then. This movie really shed new light on how nerds were viewed. They went from hated to revered by the public because they were painted as underdogs. Obviously, there are still many nerds being bullied to this day, but it isn't as frowned upon as it was back then. Let's face it, who hasn't wanted to see a bully get bested by the underdog? That's what is so great about this movie. Robert Carradine is very memorable as Lews Skolnick, reprising his role in three more sequels, two of them STV. Anthony Edwards is a blast as his best pal Gilbert. He'd be reduced to a mere cameo in the second movie and written out of the 3rd and fourth movies altogether. Curtis Armstrong is amusingly uncouth as Booger. Ted McGinley plays a terrific jock. John Goodman has a role as a coach. The rest of the cast do fine as well.

22,The-Sarkologist,A Classic T&A Movie about the college underclass,4,9 November 2013,"This was one of those films that I fondly remember from my younger years however these days it seemed to have lost all of its charm. I was keen on watching it again though because it was one of those films (in fact it was the first T&A movie that I ever saw) that I had watched numerous times when I was young. I guess I related to the main characters in these films, being somewhat of an outcast, though unlike these guys, never having a friend, or a group of friends, that I could fall back on (that is until I met the Dungeons and Dragons dorks at the State Library).It is interesting to look at some of the perspectives of this film, in a way the suggestion that the nerds of this film tend to (if they manage to survive high school and college) end up being much more successful than the jocks in this film. There is a lot of subtle imagery in it though, with the jocks being a part of a fraternity known as the Alpha-Betas, suggesting that they are the premier people on the campus.There are things that differ between my experience of university though because, being an Australian, campus life here is much different. Firstly we do not have fraternities or sororities. They simply do not exist. Secondly there is no faculty of sport in Australian universities, so you will not actually encounter anybody like the Alpha-Betas here.The other interesting thing about the characters in this film is that while it is reflective of campus life in the United States, it also brings to mind how many of the Alpha-Betas, being the sporting heroes, are unlikely to live out their days in luxury. Sporting heroes (and others in the entertainment industry) become millionaires, however it is the nerds and the geeks who become billionaires. However, the future is generally not at the forefront of people's mind when they are undergoing persecution. Granted, Gilbert does speak of Nerd Persecution at the end of the film, and I guess in a way it does exist, however in this film they use their brains to fight back, and they win. It is also interesting to note that the Alpha-Betas use fear to rule the campus, and it is only when that fear is broken (by everybody coming to understand that anybody who is not an Alpha-Beta, is by definition, a nerd) that the power of the Alpha-Betas is broken.However, while this film may have some place in my heart, it is still a T&A movie, and to be honest with you, I really don't find it all that funny anyway.",Revenge of the Nerds

24,sol-,My brief review of the film,6,28 May 2005,"Although it may be all a bit silly and quite clichéd, this is nevertheless a good film of its type, with main characters that are appealing and a great title song, scored by Thomas Newman, who would later compose the scores of movies such as 'American Beauty'. The film does not really go anywhere much at all, the jokes work only about half the time, and it is all a bit short on its content, but despite all of this, the film has a pleasant and rather enjoyable nature not common to the average college comedy, and this makes it a rather uniquely likable film overall. It may not be a great piece of cinema, but it is quite good entertainment.",Revenge of the Nerds

26,poe426,Alpha Beta blockers...,8,29 July 2014,"Long before the lovable cast of THE BIG BANG THEORY made being a Nerd fashionable, there was REVENGE OF THE NERDS. At times it plays out like a straightforward drama (which is one of its many strengths), but make no mistake about it: there's humor galore. The contretemps begin when a group of jocks burn down their frat house and immediately commandeer the Nerd house. The Nerds are forced to sleep on cots in the gymnasium. ""It's like we're refugees from a war,"" bemoans child prodigy Harold Wormser. Before long, our heroes find themselves looking for a fraternity that will sponsor them in a bid to have a say in their own fate. They end up approaching the Lambda Lambda Lambdas- headed by U.N. Jefferson (the underrated- and under-utilized- Bernie Casey). Best line: when Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) explains to his girlfriend why Nerds are so much better in bed than jocks: ""All jocks ever think about is sports. All WE ever think about is sex.""",Revenge of the Nerds
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Nerds rise above ridiculousness and stereotypes,7,12 February 2010,"The plight of the nerd has taken many forms in film and television over the years, but none so genuine as ""Revenge of the Nerds."" Amidst all the sex and party-obsessed college stereotyping and seemingly unrealistic projection of the high school nerds vs. jocks concept onto the college scene, these nerds are pretty likable characters and their pranks make for the most classic college movie scenes outside of ""Animal House.""Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards play high school best friends (and bonafide nerds equipped with ridiculous inhaling laughs) who struggle to fit in to the college scene. When the jock fraternity -- the Alpha Betas -- burn their house down, they kick the freshmen out of their dorms and somehow they all get stuck living in the gym. After fraternity rush only the nerds are left homeless, so to get out, they try and start a fraternity, eventually gaining charter status with Lambda Lambda Lambda, a historically black fraternity.At odds with the nerds are the Alpha Betas and their sister sorority the Pis. Both groups try and make life a living hell for the nerds, who decide to use their high IQs to fight back. They kick it off with the infamous panty raid, busting into the Pi house and stealing the girls' underwear while also installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms and such. Once you get over the hump that there's no feasible way for ""Revenge of the Nerds"" to ever take place and that jocks and nerds would never have a rivalry going in a college setting, this movie becomes classic. There's a lot of clever scene writing which completely makes up for the one-dimensional characters -- namely the jocks. In all other movies it would all seem completely stupid, but ""Nerds"" delivers with just the right attitude to not provoke your criticisms.The nerds and their nerd girl friends are also great characters. Lewis and Gilbert as the lead nerds are really quite endearing. There's a naivety in their performances that keeps them from turning into completely nerd stereotypes. Also, the writing team doesn't try the pointless technique of providing subplots for all the other members of the Tri-Lams. They might be stereotypes, but their comedic value is greater because they fill out the off-color picture of the nerds. Truthfully, there are so many ways ""Revenge of the Nerds"" could have slipped and become a mediocre movie, but for these reasons it remains one of the more memorable ""college"" frat movies of all time.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Revenge of the Nerds

The film follows the adventures of two ""nerds"" as they go to college and try to join a fraternity. Oh the trials and tribulations they go through. Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards are the two ""nerds""who do everything they can to try and fit in with the rest of the college crowd. This one is the first and best of the series. They should have left well enough alone. But since this was made during the 80's, a mandatory sequel was made. I recommend this movie. It's entertaining and worth watching. But like all 80's moviesit has to have a message. That's my only real complaint about the movie. A funny film none the less. Just avoid the rest of the series.Worth a view.",Revenge of the Nerds
30,jimbo-53-186511,Like Animal House only nowhere near as funny,2,16 February 2017,"Lewis (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) are sent to Adams College and quickly find themselves as outcasts due to the fact that they are 'nerds.' After being constantly bullied by the Alpha Betas or Jocks as they are otherwise known, the nerds set about getting revenge against the Jocks.So that's your basic plot line and there is no point in attempting to elaborate further as there is nothing much more that I can say beyond my basic plot summary. You essentially have the social outcasts against the popular 'sporty' types who only clash when the jocks own digs end up being burned down.What essentially follows from this point is a series of tiresome and unfunny sequences involving attempted 'one upmanship' between the two rival camps all of which have no real spark or imagination. It's also a very lazy film which felt as though it had ripped off almost everything that we'd seen before in Animal House (only to much lesser effect). Whereas Animal House was gross-out and overdone, it was at least quite amusing, but this film barely registered a chuckle with me.I also found some of the writing to be somewhat inconsistent; on the one hand it suggests at the end that you should just be happy with yourself and stand up for who you are (which is fine). However, I did take some exception with how we ultimately got to this moral conclusion; there is a scene where Lewis convinces pretty sorority girl Betty that he is her boyfriend Stan when he puts on a mask which means that Betty sleeps with Lewis (believing him to be Stan). After Lewis has slept with Betty, Lewis pulls off his mask and Betty then learns that it was Lewis that she slept with rather than Stan. Clearly she is mortified at first, but realising that he was a better lover than Stan she then decides she wants to be a nerd and remain with Lewis. Arguably, it would have been better if a nerdy girl would have been in love with Lewis, but Lewis shunned her advances because he fancied Betty only for Lewis to later discover that Betty was a shallow air head and hence Lewis ended up with the nerdy girl. That probably would have been a better direction for the film to take, but hey I can't change what has already been done... Taking everything into account, I get what the writers were trying to achieve here and I did like the whole 'pro-nerd' vibe, but I must admit to finding it slightly uncomfortable watching a nerd bed a girl under false pretences. I mean would what Lewis did to Betty be classed as rape? She consented to sex, but in the belief that she was sleeping with Stan rather than Lewis. It's just a bit morally iffy in my eyes...Revenge of the nerds has a good albeit predictable message, but truth be told the film is short on laughs, has no real character development and very little in the way of originality. I've actually enjoyed some of the more modern re-workings of Revenge of the nerds such as American Pie, but if you want some genuine old school frat-boy humour then you'd be better off watching Animal House.",Revenge of the Nerds

Now these ""nerds"" have to outsmart these Betas at every possible chance before they get pushed over the edge.Directed by Jeff Kanew (Gotcha!, Tough Guys, Troop Beverly Hills) made an light-hearted pleasing comedy with some great laughs and the cast seems to be having a great time. This film was an unexpected success, when it was release in the summer of 1984. Which ""Revenge of the Nerds"" is actually better than most of the typical teen sex comedies of that era. Carradine and Edwards are good in their roles. But this movie has a familiar supporting cast including:Timothy Busfield, Curtis Armstrong, Larry B. Scott, Donald Gibb, James Cromwell, John Goodman and more. This picture went on to be a major cult classic over the year and it went on to have three sequels (Only ""Revenge of the Nerds 2"" got released theatrically). Which some of the cast members went on to be stay with this silly but enjoyable movies. The latest DVD is a special edition. DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an decent Dolby Stereo 2.0 Sound (Also in it's original Mono sound). DVD has an running commentary track by the director with cast members:Carradine, Busfield & Armstrong. DVD also has Deleted Scenes, an amusing 40 minute featurette with the cast & crew, trailers and the never seen before TV pilot. ""Revenge of the Nerds"" still holds up today, it's still an great 1980's classic. It's turns serious towards the end but it has a fine message and nearly makes you proud to be a nerd (If you are or not) in a good way. It's a good flick that certainly worth seeing.

Growing up as an outsider and hating the jocks and cheerleaders, I found the material easily relatable being outside of the status quo as metal/ punk kid. Not exactly a nerd, I sucked at academics, but I was an underdog that gave society the finger(with a big smile on my face). This is a film that shows what it is like to be an underdog and as such I can empathize with the plight of our likeable and unlikely heroes. This holds up well due to having memorable characters and hilarious quotable dialouge. The movie is very unhinged and wild with large doses of t+a, these nerds can surely party and are seen as a threat by football players, The Alpha Betas. As off the wall as the material is this is well written, directed and performed. Revenge Of The Nerds would become a franchise with one more feature film and a few made for television movies, the sequel ROTN 2 Nerds In Paradise is classic as well and the made for tv sequels are entertaining, but none of them are as good as the 1st film.

34,a_chinn,"The original ""Big Bang Theory,"" 1980s style",7,7 October 2017,"I suppose this isn't exactly a Slobs vs. Snobs comedy, but it follows the same basic premise with loser nerds setting up their own fraternity in opposition to the jock fraternity hegemony. It's really nerds vs. jocks, but the film follows the same basic underdogs versus ruling class story structure. Although the comedy formula is familiar, it did have an original take on social class with it's nerds vs. jocks storyline. The film drips of 1980s from the soundtrack to ridiculous looking robots to some pretty awful stereotypes of Asians and gay men. For a supremely crass comedy, the film does boast a strong cast that includes Robert ""Django"" Carradine, Anthony ""Top Gun"" Edwards, Timothy ""The West Wing"" Busfield, Curtis ""Moonlighting"" Armstrong, James ""Babe"" Cromwell, John ""Monsters, Inc."" Goodman, Bernie ""Hit Man"" Casey, and Ted ""Love Boat"" McGinley (okay, McGinley doesn't count as strong casting, but he is funny). You also get a terrific 1980s style Thomas Newman score, which I loved. My bold statement regarding the film is that without ""Revenge of the Nerds"" we may never have gotten ""Big Bang Theory."" Overall, this film is comic fluff, crass, and completely disreputable, but it's also nostalgically quite enjoyable for anyone who grew up in the 80s. If a pretty sorority girl screaming ""A nerd saw me naked!"" seems like comic gold, you'll probably enjoy watching ""Revenge of the Nerds.""",Revenge of the Nerds
35,triple8,Nerds Nerds!!!!,9,14 December 2003,"I think every kid growing up should be required to watch this. Revenge of the nerds is hilarious but its also surprisingly touching and still relevant today. What the movie depicts as going on is sadly realistic-at least at the schools I attended. The movie's message is an important one and accurate-a great film for anyone who's ever felt lonely, alienated,completely on the outside looking in-and I think that would include many if not most people, including the tormentors of others as well as the people tormented. Revenge does a great job of showing that and the last scene is one of the most enjoyable I've seen.

Best friends from high school, Louis (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) go away to Adams College together. Upon arrival they and their nerd friends are picked on by the super-cool football playing Alpha Betas. Dirty, raunchy, and completely unsuitable for teenage viewing, this movie makes it fun to remember what it was like when comedies actually contained full frontal female nudity! The locker room speech by John Goodman is one of the funniest things I have ever heard.Some of the writing is really sloppy, and not in an appealing kind of way either. Much of the movie focuses on a gigantic party scene with lots of typical college humor which results in a lot of pointless nonsense filler. In my opinion, the story-line should focus more on the actual nerds getting picked on. By the way, it's amazing watching this back when the Talking Heads were popular and Michael Jackson's solo career was taking off. Ah, I remember those days. Music was so good back then. This is a movie that is not to be taken seriously and is recommended to older teenagers and adults who are teenagers at heart!Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Revenge of the Nerds

38,baumer,Another funny teen film from the 80's,9,23 May 2000,"With the resurgence of the raunchy teen comedy, now seems like as good a time as ever to go back and study its roots. What kinds of films influenced American Pie and Road Trip? It is easy to point out films like Porky's, Animal House and Fasttimes, but somewhere forgotten in all this is Jeff Kanew's hilarious flick REVENGE OF THE NERDS. This is not only entertaining and funny, but it contains what has to be considered a blue print for success in campus comedy. Take lots of people getting drunk, jocks ostracizing nerds from there way of life, the weak rising up to take back what is just as much a right as it is to others, and of course lots of nudity featuring an abundance of gorgeous women. What you have here is a great recipe for success.What made Revenge work is that it didn't try to pretend to be something that it wasn't. This was an exploitive sex-fest and it worked well. What it also had was a funny script and one that we could all relate to. I mean, who hasn't felt left out or relegated to the side lines while someone else gets all the glory? Besides being extremely funny, this film touched on something that we all can relate to.Revenge of the Nerds is another of the teen films that was hilarious and it ended up spawning a slew of sequels. Avoid them and see this one again. It's worth it, especially if you were a teen when it came out. And if you are a teen now, this is a treat to watch. This is one of the films that writers study when they are thinking what they can put into their film to make it crude, rude and raunchy. This should be a must see!9 out of 10",Revenge of the Nerds

40,KnightsofNi11,Nothing special but pretty fun,6,28 May 2012,"There's a laundry list of things that one comes to expect when they prepare to watch an 80's comedy. Cheesy music full of synthesizers, high school stereotypes, breasts, outdated technology that is unintentionally hilarious, the list goes on. Lo and behold, Revenge of the Nerds has all of that. Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards star as two college bound nerds who find that college life isn't what they expected. It's nothing more than a continuation of high school as they get picked on my jocks and laughed at by the pretty girls. But now they've finally had enough and they decide to stand up for themselves and fight back against the jocks and to wipe away the nerd stereotype for good. A collection of exaggerated antics ensue, and it all makes for a wacky good time.Like I said, Revenge of the Nerds has everything you could expect from an 80's comedy. It fits the formula almost too well, which might be why it has achieved an underground cult status. For me, I think the 80's comedy formula just doesn't work and it doesn't entice me as much as a more offbeat or alternative comedy film might. Revenge of the Nerds is just silly, crude, and over the top, but it's certainly not trying to be anything it's not. So for this I can enjoy this nutty little film for what it is. I didn't find it particularly hilarious, but it has its moments and it's certainly a nonstop ride of entertainment. It's not exactly my thing, but it's plenty fun for what it is.It's unfair to judge Revenge of the Nerds as anything other than a very straightforward comedy, so I won't look at it as anything other than that. It's not something I'll watch again and I won't consider it an overtly memorable comedy, but it kept me entertained for an hour and a half and with certain movies that's all you can ask for.

I like ""Revenge of the nerds "" not only because in some way this movie is about me , but also because of the message it's sending to the world – don't be ashamed of who you are . The so-called ""beautiful"" people are pathetic losers with their hate for people who aren't exactly like them. Even the nerds will have their day in life .

""ROTF"" is unrealistic in some moments (the romance between Lewis and Judy , isn't Ogre too old to be in college ? ) which doesn't destroys the fun. The nerds won without using violence . The brain beat the brawl . That's cool .The talent show performance is one of the greatest moments in history of 80's movies. The ending with the song ""We are the champions "" is surprisingly touching. A heart warming ending. ""ROTF"" was so successful that Hollywood made 3 sequels (the last two were basically TV-movies ) . I don't recommend any of them , maybe with the exception of second one , which is kinda watchable.You don't have to be a nerd to appreciate it . Unlike most of teen comedies today it at least feels honest. I give it 2/10.",Revenge of the Nerds

45,grahamsj3,Good lighthearted film,8,7 February 2005,"This is one that I think will be popular for many years to come. The film is about Nerds, who are looked down upon, ignored, even discriminated against by the popular set, and how the Nerds get even. No, they don't get even, they get *ahead*! Starring Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards and Curtis Armstrong as the Nerds and Julia Montgomery, Ted McGinley and (as Ogre) Donald Gibb as the popular set. The whole story revolves around brains vs brawn, determination in the face of adversity, and, ultimately, pride in what you are, whether popular or not. The Nerds are ingenious at times, and, despite occasional despair, never quite give up the ship. I hope I'm not making the film sound serious, because it is definitely NOT really serious. It has an awful lot of humor. The brand of humor in this film is definitely different from what usually passes for humor I'm most of today's films, that being sophomoric sexual innuendo, physical (slapstick) or scatological. I really like this flick, and you will too!",Revenge of the Nerds
46,Isaac5855,An Instant Classic for the Underdog in All of Us...,7,5 December 2005,"The ultimate ""Misfits Revenge"" movie, REVENGE OF THE NERDS became an instant classic in 1984, with some of the most memorable scenes and quotable dialogue since YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. This raunchy comedy follows a group of oddball college students who are thrown together by circumstance and exposed to constant humiliation and ridicule by the jock fraternity on campus and how they get their ultimate pay back. Yes, the film is predictable as they come as we've seen this formula a million times, but it's watchable thanks to some wonderful set pieces, outrageous dialogue and on target performances by Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Curtis Armstrong (memorable as Booger), John Goodman, Ted McGinley (no that is not a misprint), Larry B. Scott, and Timothy Busfield. Standout scenes include the ""Wonder Joint"" Party and the Lamda's musical performance during the big Olympic competition. A hilarious comedy that demands repeated viewings.",Revenge of the Nerds
47,emm,Frat film could have been funnier and not as raunchy.,5,5 January 1999,"I hate to compare those ""frathouse"" movies with softer, gentler teenage material such as CLUELESS because we're dealing with two different sub-genres here. REVENGE OF THE NERDS is a step above teen movies, and because it requires some ill-conceived R-rated trash. It could have been the other way around. The two ""nerds"" in glasses was what made this movie likeable and special in every way, plus their ability to ""rule"" over an opposing fraternity that humiliated them made it an entertaining pleasure. This one should have been less intent on its raunchiness, though. The satire is welcome, but the film goes way off course when we're treated to plenty of unneeded flatulence and feminine body parts. Much more attention to comedy elements would've flattened the impact down to minimum size. An O.K. movie for its own good, yet ANIMAL HOUSE is far better on laughs than this one offered.",Revenge of the Nerds

The story-line are charming, pretty creative especially if you looking for a teen movie that more than just boy and girl falling in love with one another. BEWARE you might hate another teen movie after you watch this movie REVENGE OF THE NERDS.I highly recommended that every one should watch this movie, but Revenged Of The Nerds Part 3 and 4 are a real disappointment.

A couple of nerd protagonists in a new college, the jock group, the chicks, racial stereotypes, Weird Al Yankovic and an 80's then-modern computerized soundtrack... you get it already.But is it any good ? Yeah. It's funny. From the most annoying donkey-like geek laughs, to the deadpan presence of Bernie Casey in some of the most ridiculous scenes of the film, the stupid weird dancing and uptight nerds going wild, the gay black kid character at a time when one could just laugh at funny things without moral taboos... the movie-makers really did some work for this one and it isn't the gratuitous unsubtle incarnation of the project you may imagine.Whether it's a cult classic changes nothing for you if you're a new viewer, but there's more to this film than just the narratives. Oh and a nice, and believable moral at the end.Discover it if you're tempted to in the first place, it's pretty fun.",Revenge of the Nerds
51,TheHonestCritic,This is the best college film in the history of cinema.,10,23 July 2019,"""Revenge of the Nerds"" (1984), whenever someone mentions ""college film"", this is the first movie that comes to mind. This film is another example of what I consider a perfect movie. Not only is it a perfect movie, but it's one of my top 10 favorite movies of all-time! Perfect story, perfect cast, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations, and of course a perfect soundtrack. This movie takes me back to my college days, and it gives me flashbacks to my childhood (EVEN THOUGH I WAS BORN IN 1992). When I grew up, I may not have been a 100% nerd, or a 100% jock, I was more in the middle of the road. I had brains as well as brawn, and I still do! ""Revenge of the Nerds"" illustrates the ongoing dilemma between the two major peers (nerds and jocks) with sheer finesse. It shows the viewer to be proud of who they are, no matter who or what you are. This is the college movie with it all! The morals are still relevant to this day. While this movie is considered to be a comedy, it also has great drama, and definitely a lot of heart and soul. I'm not going to spoil any thing, but the ending of this movie always gets me choked up and gives me goosebumps every single time I watch it. So if you have not seen this film, you might want to make sure you have a box of tissues for the last scene and ending. If a movie can move you every single time you watch it, you know you have a perfect film. Like my other top 10 all-time favorite movies, and several other movies besides my top 10 that I consider perfect, I can watch this movie 100 times in a row and never get bored with it. Obviously, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen this movie yet, go watch it, and if you've seen it before watch it again. Stand tall and be proud of who you are, watch ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and it will change your perspective on life, for the better. No matter what time period you watch this movie in, it is truly a timeless movie for any generation.",Revenge of the Nerds
52,ReelCheese,Squanders Great Premise,2,4 September 2006,"Yet another unfunny film that squanders a great premise. Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards are nerds hoping college will be a place where people look past their geekiness. Instead their presumed torture from high school continues as they and their fellow dweebs are pushed around by jocks, maligned by girls and generally stripped of their dignity. But the ""odd get even,"" as the tagline states, by forming their own fraternity and proving their power as a four-eyed, accordion-loving, chess-playing group.Of course ""Revenge of the Nerds"" wasn't meant to win any awards. It's supposed to be a crude comedy for older teens. The trouble is, none of the crudeness works. The nerds place hidden cameras to watch the popular girls undress. They secretly distribute topless photos of a snotty cheerleader in the bottom of cream pie plates. They smoke pot and throw lame parties. None of it's particularly funny.This film doesn't even work on a level that other unfunny comedies sometimes can. A comedy can be entertaining without being hilarious. But ""Revenge of the Nerds"" tries to be little else other than a dumb comedy. At its conclusion, it attempts to deliver a feel-good message about being yourself, but by then it's impossible to take anything it has to say seriously.I really wanted to like this film. The trailer included on the DVD version made it look like a lot of fun. But when all is said and done, the jocks and the cheerleaders aren't the only ones facing the wrath of these nerds.",Revenge of the Nerds
53,dimplet,A second-rate Porky's knock-off,4,25 October 2011,"When you're in the mood to watch a bad movie filled with bad acting, Revenge of the Nerds is worth considering. Fortunately, you don't have to be a masochist to watch Revenge of the Nerds, as it is not painfully bad. But it does help to have an IQ below 80. While I am not the world's expert on bad movies, nor have I read a scholarly dissertation on the evolution of dumb, dumber and dumbest movies, my guess is this paean to stupidity served as a prototype for subsequent excuses for inflicting bad scripts on the eternal adolescents. It lowered the bar for the minimum standard of quality for a movie and still return a profit, but there were even worse movies to come that lowered the bar a notch at a time, until it was impossible to make a movie any dumber without encountering the Springtime for Hitler effect. To give credit where credit is due, I guess it takes a certain amount of talent to deliver a nerdy performance, unless you are the genuine article. The trouble is, any resemblance between these characters and actual living, breathing human beings is purely coincidental. James Cromwell comes close to avoiding looking like a walking cardboard cutout, wisely stepping back a notch from hyper-over-acting. Too bad the youngsters didn't take a cue from this pro. Actually, Curtis Armstrong, ""Booger"", probably delivers the only decent performance.And it must take a certain amount of talent to produce (I hesitate to say ""write"") a script that never for a moment comes within 45 degrees of realism. The movie is almost plot-free, but does manage the stumble from one gag to another in an only mildly inebriated and entertaining fashion. OK, I will admit that I did laugh at some of the gags, which were presented in a deft fashion. If not, I would have rated this a 2. You can watch this and enjoy it, if you are in the right mood. But to credit Revenge of the Nerds with establishing a genre is historically inaccurate. First there was Animal House in 1978, though before that, there was Saturday Night Live, the TV show. Then there was Porky's in 1982. Porky's cost $4 million to make, and at last count had raked in $105 million. It was the original adolescent, sex, revenge movie. It was clever, cute, original and had good acting. Revenge of the Nerds came out in 1984 in an obvious attempt to cash in on this trend. It's made money, too, probably mostly because of all the teenage boys wanting to see naked girls. Hey, these are some hot bods! But there was nothing in the least clever about the nerds' ""revenge."" It was all downhill from there. On the other hand, Porky's director Bob Clark turned around and made the classic ""Christmas Story"" in 1983 based on Jean Shepard's short stories. Not a nude girl in it. It is one of my favorite movies. My point is, in talented hands, you can make an adolescent movie spiced with sex and hijinxs that can work on multiple levels and have some quality and class. But I guess this is too much work for some directors.Porky's is far better than it's ""reputation."" Heck, I would say it is a classic of its genre. Definitely a worth see. There is enough realism that you can imagine real people and situations like this.Yes, Revenge of the Nerds is amusing and not particularly painful to watch. But with a more talent and effort it could have risen to the level of being a good movie.",Revenge of the Nerds

The main reason why Revenge Of The Nerds works and why it's sequels don't is that, we want to see these nerds prevail and see the jocks get their comeuppance.

Or use my hair full of gel. Or have that characteristic ""snort"" in my laugh. Still, I am a nerd, and I know I'll always be. It's just that it was SO UNCOOL to be one back in the 1980's. People used to bother us, kick us, insult us, hit us. They took our stuff away, hid it, or simply throwed it to the trash bin.And then, something like this comes along and shows us that, indeed, we are nerds, but that we must not accept a punishment for it. Ha! It was a big morale booster back then, and it is still now. I had to take a couple of punches, but it was really worth it.So, when rating a movie, a very important part is the impression it left in your life. Revenge of the Nerds is a sweet little classic for my generation; it is the movie that showed you that everybody could have his day, even if he was a nerd, in a big way.And so, 17 years after watching it, I look around all my friends, my girlfriend, and even some ex-jocks, and I finally figured it out. We were all nerds. Some, though, were more insecure than the others, so they had to resort to sports, physical violence, and humilliation.

This is a film that it is impossible to commend but whilst it should have sunk into oblivion long ago, it still has enough consumer appeal to remain readily available. In fact it is even well on its way to becoming a cult classic. The reason is partly of course that most of us enjoy any film about underdogs who are being abused by their more successful contemporaries but find a way to strike back and earn their place in the sun. None of us can hope for a continually successful life without setbacks, and such films provide necessary encouragement at these times. This was an early example, and it may even have saved a few unhappy young nerds in unsympathetic Colleges from suicidal thoughts.

Back in the early eighties nerds were people who were smart, knew about computers and were- well a little different.  While in the 90's you don't have to be a nerd to be computer literate or smart there are elements in this film which are highly amusing.  Who can really go past the belching scene for laughs.  While the laughs of the two main nerds cracks me up every time, because yes some people really do laugh like that!.  The plot is a little predictable but that's half the fun.

The characters themselves are funny but they are shown off to better effect in the film's sequel: Nerds in Paradise. Nerds in Paradise is much better than this movie and you would be better off seeing that one if you haven't seen this. Since plot and character development is not important in these films, although most of the characters are carried over into the second film, you won't have trouble following the action. Booger is the funniest nerd by far and he really should have been used more. Bottom Line: See the second one first and then if that hooks you see this. That's how I did it.

Robert Carradine & Anthony Edwards lead a cast of all stars in this very funny and intelligent movie about a group of misfits who use their intelligence to fight back against a group of football players in a fraternityI myself was a nerd too and got bullied and picked on a lot so in a way i understood how the characters felt about being treated differently because of my appearance and the fact that I'm smart.Besides Lewis one of my other favourite characters in the movie is Gilbert his best friend, he takes a stand against nerd prosecution by helping his friends fight for their rights.When best friends Lewis Skolnick (Carradine) & Gilbert Lowe (Edwards) begin their freshman year at Adams College they are unaware of the trouble that's ahead for them. Upon arrival they quickly discover that people like them are treated different, when a popular fraternity called the Alpha Betas run by Stan Gable (McGinley) carelessly burn down their house they seize control of the freshmen dorm for their own. With no place to go the displaced freshmen move into the gymnasium until they find a place or be accepted into other fraternities. Joining our two heroes are child genius Harold Wormser (Cassesse), violin player Pointdexter (Busfield), nose picking Dudley Dawson aka Booger (Armstrong), Chinese exchange student Takashi (Tochi) and Lamar Latrelle (Scott). Aiding the Alpha Betas is their neighbouring sorority The Pi Delta Pis. Further complicating the situation is Lewis's developing crush on Betty Childs (Montgomery)a popular cheerleader, sorority sister and Gable's girlfriend.Two of my favourite scenes in the film include Lewis disguising himself so he can have sex with Betty in the fun house and the most surprising part is when she falls in love with him and dumps Stan then she declares ""I'm in love with a nerd"".The other scene takes place after the Lambdas win the homecoming games and return to find their house totally trashed and almost destroyed and Gilbert finally decides he's not gonna take the abuse anymore and goes to confront the enemy.The ending was pretty awesome because this group of ordinary young men fought for their rights and won against the beautiful people, seeing everyone including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy (Meyrink) joining the crowd was entertaining. The song We Are The Champions fit that part perfectly.Other cast members included John Goodman from Roseanne, Donald Gibb, Matt Salinger, Bernie Casey, David Wohl and Jamie Cromwell as Mr. Skolnick. they delivered good performances.For fans of comedy and nerds out there I recommend Revenge Of The Nerds it's a sure crowd pleaser.",Revenge of the Nerds

69,marimbadaddy,And the Geeks Shall Inherit the Earth,7,16 March 2009,"Revenge of the Nerds may turn out to be one of those comedy classics similar to Caddy Shack, Animal House, and Porky's. R.O.N. was probably intended to be a B movie however, it ended up being far more than that, similar to the phenomenon that Napoleon Dynamite had 20 years later. The film features a somewhat unique perspective of the underdogs overcoming adversity. Although this film is probably geared more towards being a teen flick, it certainly can have a much broader audience appeal.Robert Carradine's performance of Lewis, the head geek, is so on target, I think he may have type cast himself into that character. Though, his choosing to remain with the franchise for three additional sequels is somewhat questionable as they were of inferior quality scripts. Timmothy Bustfiel is also great as Poindexter, as is Curtis Armstrong as Booger. Anthony Edwards certainly became the biggest star of this bunch, and was amicable as Gilbert, the more introverted of our favorite nerds. And this was just before John Goodman started on Rosanne.Aside from all the various geek clichés that are featured in the films, there is ample potty humor & shtick, some marijuana humor, and plenty of T&A. Definitely is worth the 90 minutes to watch, and better to rent than try to watch on TV, as the language and nudity which makes it funnier is cut.",Revenge of the Nerds

I write this from the perspective of a voyeuristic 8 year old who remembers the trailer, after seeing it at a drive in (I was actually 10 when I first watched this). It was one of many T&A movies that many a pubescent boy spoke of, with glee.When I was ten, and didn't know anything, I chalked that scene up to pure fantasy. As in, the guy who admires someone from afar, has an opportunity to make their attraction known, by way of disguise.And while this movie is so much more than that scene, the fact is, it didn't take long before that scene became 'creepy',So, this isn't an attempt at being 'woke', it's common sense. In hindsight, that scene didn't age well.But where I do think it succeeds, and is deserving of its lasting legacy, is it truly sparked the fire which brings Nerd Culture into the social vernacular.I've watched this evolution. This movie (but not the ridiculous sequels) really starts a seismic shift in celebrity and social culture.

73,dsalouk,Enjoyable and silly,6,11 February 2017,"Revenge of the Nerds is a silly but great film. It paints the typical stereotype of nerds and jocks, and fuels the fire for the never-ending battle between the two types. It brings new light and perspective to the high school drama, and makes it very enjoyable. Curtis Armstrong is the most memorable performance as he has a unique voice and unique delivery of lines. Whilst Revenge of the Nerds is self-explanatory in the title, it provides a unique style of delivering a dish best served cold, and caters to the underdog of the social and school world in a silly and enjoyable manner. It is a feel good story with a predictable ending, but an ending none the less that delivers on the goods.",Revenge of the Nerds
74,craigman,I will always love this movie!,10,11 May 2006,"I don't understand why this movie is rated only a 6. It is far superior to most of the comedies from around the same time and a lot of comedies from recent years. It holds up today amazingly well. Most comedies from the 80's kind of lose their charm over the years. I saw this again recently with my wife (she had never seen it), and she loved it and I laughed just as much as I did before. It's not just a mindless college sex romp like Porky's. It had some intelligence and a lot of heart. It was also refreshingly politically incorrect and raunchy. There are some truly unforgettable characters, like Booger and Lamar. The Asian guy was really funny too. Also, the child prodigy. There were lots of funny, quotable lines, and tons of hilarious scenes, like the party scene. The talent show performance was a moment in history. The end was truly touching. This movie is a classic. It's up there with ""Airplane"", ""Weird Science"", and ""There's Something About Mary"". You don't have to be a nerd to love it!

When you're young you laugh at the boobies and Booger but now that I am older, there is so much more subtle humor in it. The fact the nerds belong to an all black fraternity alone is hilarious. Plus, the film is so un-PC it would never be made nowadays.

81,bayhorse,"Timely Social Satire, but Certainly No Comedy!!!",10,23 October 2006,"I had nothing but hell, every year in school, from both ends: First, those in ""authority,"" who permitted my kind to be savagely assaulted, by, secondly, a majority of ""peers"" who literally needed bullwhips applied to their backs; but who were never disciplined, since those in ""authority"" were too busy threatening my kind (among other things, the most conveniently easy to handle!), if we ever dared think of defensively fighting back! . . . Hitler, too, had encouraged such bullying, to either ""weed out"" or ""toughen"" the ""weak,"" although I would have to give even if not especially him at least enough credit to where, much more probably, no such double standard would have been so ""piously,"" rancorously enforced, under his jurisdiction! . . . The physical education instructors, especially, were always emphasizing militarism, and encouraging their closest friends among the students to relentlessly pursue their favorite sadistic pastime, of systematically destroying the self-images of every ""nerd"" on campus, so as to feed off the condition of degradation which resulted! . . . Moreover, most females, who otherwise whine about ""brutes,"" are characteristically at the vanguard of this persecution; until it's hardly any wonder that so many males symbiotically cleave, sexually, to other males, where they can both play the female role, with relation to one-another! Many females also aspire to being men, while feeling smugly certain they can have it both ways! . . . Such ""cleverly amusing satire"" may, however, only succeed, overall, at ""unoffensively"" smoothing out too many of the ""roughest edges!"" Thus, for a much more grimly candid portrayal of the kinds of damage people succeed at doing to one-another, until it's sometimes vomited right back out, Charles Bronson's ""Ten to Midnight"" deserves much more scrutiny! Personally, I thank God, Unto This Very Day, that, Unlike Warren Stacey (Gene Davis), I Shall Always Continue, as I Always Have, to ""Aspire To Being An Angel!!!"". . . However, it's actually James Dean, in ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" which is my own much more realistically normative ""Cup of Tea!"" I struggled, in school, and at home, with exactly the same problems! The details of what Jim Stark had to endure, internally, too, as the kind of person he was, were all very accurately portrayed, with relation to me; save, that is, for his most tragically climactic experience, in the middle, as well as the hopefully promising ending. ""Parenthetically,"" Plato (All Remember Sal Mineo, Don't They?), too, was a Dismally Unheeded Warning, Even To This Very Day, and Despite So Many More Of Them Now! Moreover, I Had To Experience What Plato Felt, Too; But, Again, Thank God, Not The Kind Of Thing He Finally Ended Up Doing!!! . . . Even My later experience, as Cal, in ""East of Eden,"" shall continue, Thank God (minus any doubt about what He Wills!), keeping me as intact as it did him, since I haven't yet reached the very end of it. But, as for ""Giant?"" I'm just lucky enough, at least, never to have had the money--or the racism!!! For another glaring view of this kind of problem, compare the difference between the Jonas Cord, Sr., of Brian Keith, in Nevada Smith, and Leif Erickson, in The Carpetbaggers! Consider, also, a very old man, in Amadeus, who never could quite grasp the answer to a question which had been perpetually in front of his very nose! Burt Lancaster's Robert Stroud, the ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" was a more valuable gift of longevity, bestowed by Woodrow Wilson; although Cordell Walker, Texas Ranger, wasn't so lucky with a little boy he had just about talked out of suicide, before the boy slipped accidentally and tragically to his death! Many continue to ask why the Lord, if there really is one, after-all, permits such senselessly wasteful tragedies to occur; while, at the same time, He's undoubtedly asking why almost everybody permits such expensively vital lessons to go no less thoroughly to waste! Kirk Douglas said it well, several years ago, in a television ad: Prospective suicides don't really want to die, they just want to stop the pain!!! But as for Mark Twain's Sid Sawyer?

82,pcernea-1,"A Funny Comedy, But Flawed",6,12 April 2010,"I agree with most of the reviews on here saying that this is a very funny movie, etc. But, at the risk of being a party pooper, I feel compelled to point out what I consider a big flaw in this film. (Warning: this is a spoiler.)That flaw is the following. This movie is supposed to make us feel that nerds are oppressed by jocks, and we are meant to see the nerds beat the jocks while not stooping to their level. However, I think that the nerds exhibit worse behavior in this movie than the jocks. All the jocks do is vandalize the nerds' house or insult the nerds. They don't ever, say, beat up the nerds. Nor do they sexually harass the nerdy girls. But the nerds go on the panty raid (maybe this is just petty theft, not so bad) and install cameras to spy on the popular girls when they're naked. And they distribute the naked pictures to the whole school during the carnival. This is ungentlemanly to say the least. But the cherry on the icing is how Lewis puts on the Darth Vader mask to have sex with Betty Childs. Yes, she's happy about it in the end, but what if she hadn't been? Do the ends justify the means? Lewis' behavior was deceitful and sleazy at best.The point I want to make is that, because of these behaviors, the nerds have stained themselves, and they are not really sympathetic characters, although we overlook it because they're nerds, overgrown children essentially. Would we turn such a blind eye if they were jocks? I think that the makers of the movie should have tried a little harder and made a similar film where the nerds had more moral fiber. Ask this: are these really the role models we want young nerds growing up with?",Revenge of the Nerds
83,jafonte01,The Road to Nerdition: A Faulty and Tenuous Comedy,4,9 March 2015,"Revenge of the Nerds is a comedy about nerdy freshmen trying to obtain a most basic level of respect that would be needed for adequate human decency. Here, we will see that, regardless of the ending, the nerds never got their revenge.The stereotypical jocks, the Alpha Betas, have no reason to hate nerds. From the beginning, the character ""Ogre"" merely pigeonholes two innocent freshmen as ""nerds."" The motive behind the character is never laid out. I surmise it is a cultural standard for the 1980's to hate nerds, and we as the audience are expected to understand that. This is the crucial point that one must remind himself of constantly as he watches this movie. To watch this movie in the 21st century is to endure a staggering barrage of prejudices against race, sexual orientation, and of course against those with high IQs. In fact, watching this movie now will jar your perception about prejudices in general; it will make the viewer say, ""Hell, I didn't even know that was something worth being prejudiced about."" The viewer will simply shake his head and ask, ""Why?"" And I say now: why? Why was there just so much hatred against intellectualism in the 1980's that Hollywood devoted a full-blown movie to it? This question is virtually screamed when analyzing Dean Ulich. Dean Ulich is a self-identifying nerd with no backbone (note that nerd and no-backbone are not synonymous, although that's apparently a stereotype in this film). Dean Ulich runs a school where an entire building on campus burns down, and he brushes it off. He moderates a Greek council where there is no such concept as conflict-of-interest. Obviously, if this were real life, the Dean would have been impeached and sued in civil court for a motley of negligences, ranging from a house on campus being broken into and overrun with pigs to condoning an entire police force from looking the other way as soon as it has to do with fraternities (what else would campus police do then?).Overall, it's difficult to muster the suspension for disbelief when people are spying on girls in the the bathroom (illegal wiretapping), impersonating as someone else while having sex (rape), and cheating their way to win in the school's most important social competition (using illegal drugs in a competition, especially when ""trichloro-methylene"", if real, would be an extremely dangerous drug for consumption). The antics will prevent suspension of disbelief, and if the 1980's were really like that at college, then God help all those born with the savage moronicism of the almighty Alpha Betas running through their veins. The prevalence of this Idiocracy is supported by at least three sequels, none of which can be readily memorable.A couple of miscellaneous points about the movie (SPOILERS HERE): 1. They couldn't find a nerd who could actually play the violin??? 2. When they call for a nerd gathering, the first person to come was not a nerd... 3. The only way the nerds won were with the backup of the very masculine black Lambds. This, for all intents and purposes, ruined the point of the entire movie.",Revenge of the Nerds

When this movie sinks to nudity or burping contests, you can only shake your head and sigh. But when it touches on satire (especially on college life and society's ill-placed respect for sports and machismo), this movie never fails to bring a laugh.  All of the nerds are extremely likeable, especially Gilbert (played gamely by Anthony Edwards, who has somehow become a sex symbol on 'ER.'  From nerd to hunk... bully for you, Anthony!).  I very rarely 'root' for the good guys in movies, because their 'goodness' seems contrived.

86,Cryptfan2,"So, why is it funny?",3,2 August 2008,"Okay, after finding out the film has a decent sized fanbase so I decided to check out the film on HBO. After watching it, I was just unimpressed, very unimpressed.First off, the characters aren't very good. The nerds, the jocks, and even the girls and teachers are very annoying. They acted like the Mary Sues and Gary Stus you'd read in fanfiction. They're too annoying, they're way too impossible to like or care about.Plus, where are the other cliques like the punks since they were a clique in the 80's, so why aren't they there too? Another problem I have with the film is the writing which is the script itself, it's not so good. The dialogue is more annoying, the acting didn't help although actors such as John Goodman tried to make the best out of it.And the jokes aren't very good, they're just not funny. The thing is, call me bias or anything but I felt that the film was trying to imitate Animal House but it failed so badly at doing that. If John Landis was somehow offered to direct the film and rejected it, I can see why.The only good things about it were John Goodman and Bernie Casey, they played their roles and made the best out of the script they were given.And the choice of music is pretty good, the theme song is pretty catchy, a bit annoying but catchy.I'm sorry to the Nerds fanbase but this film just isn't very good, bash me and flame me all you like but it won't change my opinion.Overall, 3/10 from me.

And then watching it again the next few years it became even funnier because I started to get more of the jokes. And of course at that age being a dude, the gratuitous and frequent nudity was awesome.I was one of those kids that was bullied and harassed pretty much all the time at school and seeing the Nerds come together to defeat the Alpha-Betas and the Pies was such an amazing inspiring part of the movie.Of course this movie has many many tropes and it certainly qualifies as a true 1980s teen party / sex movie.I still watch it at least once every few days (jk...but at least a few times every year) and it always has me lmao ....and always makes me proud and inspired at the end when everyone that has been picked on, bullied, and harassed all come together at the end.There is no way a movie like this would ever be made in this era, as it is one of the most un PC movies ever made.

88,lpokeefe,Excellent stereotype comedy,9,10 August 2005,"I learned of the ""stereotype line"" one day in my public speaking class. We were doing a game in which you had a partner who would observe you at close range while you were walking around the classroom. This partner would then have to exaggerate your walk twice: first a little bit, then a lot. Everyone laughed at the first bit of exaggeration, but everyone knew that the second part was going too far. Thus, the stereotype line: you can't take your stereotypes too far.I also have a theory that works a little like the Uncanny Valley. If you're going to have stereotypes in your movie, you can't take them too far, but you can't take them too lightly. Thus, the perfect point to be is just before the stereotype line. If you can manage to get there, your movie will be funny. ""Revenge of the Nerds"" hits that point. And as such, it is very funny.""Nerds"" is home to a whole bunch of stereotypes: your giant-glasses nerds, your gay black guy, your super-smart kid, your lazy drug-maestro guy, your big dumb jock who doesn't say much, your football coach who hates everybody, your Bob Balaban school dean, your nerdy guy who tries in vain to play the violin, your Japanese immigrant who doesn't speak English all that well, your nerdy woman. However, this film manages to get the stereotypes to just the right level, making each and every character extremely funny.It also doesn't hurt that the plot works. Yes, the plot may be a little generic, but somehow it works here. It's probably because of the occasional deviations from traditional slapstick comedy structure that this movie really works. In truth, I may have never seen a funnier movie. I certainly have never seen one this funny with a score this good and a cast that works so well together.My recommendation? Just go buy the movie. You'll thank yourself for it.",Revenge of the Nerds
89,afelgueres-77036,Classic nerd movie. Ignore the SJW feminist reviews and read mine!,10,30 September 2021,"This was one of the first comedies I watched growing up in the 80's. I loved this movie because it was funny and the characters were memorable. You had your main nerds Lewis and Gilbert. Then you had your side nerds Booger, Lamar, Poindexter, Toshiro, and Wormser. Booger is my favorite nerd because I consider him to be more of a loser as opposed to being an actual nerd and he had some of the best lines (like his mom's douchebag being in Ohio). Also like the fact that he's a bud smoker as well.Even the villains were cool and had good actors. You had Ted McKineley as the leader of the Jocks Stan Gable and John Goodman as the alpha coach. Ogre is a Jock that is built like a tank, and usually takes orders from Stan to stomp on the nerds.What I liked about this movie was the feeling of relating to it. Growing up I really had very few friends and I was bullied for being different. I like Gilbert's speech at the end when he talks about being a nerd and tells everyone it's ok to be a nerd and embrace being different.That being said there were several reviewers that gave me the reason for my title. Don't listen to these idiots because they tend to overreact to everything and try to be the victim.There is a (spoilers) scene where one of the nerds (Lewis) is trying to get with the Quarterback's girlfriend at the college carnival. The girlfriend mistakes the nerd for her boyfriend (he was in a similar halloween costume) and the two go to a secluded area at the carnival and have sex. She doesn't realize she was fooled until the nerd took his mask off. She was shocked, but said that she enjoyed being with him.Case in point now you have the libtards and SJWs crying about how he ""raped"" her and how there is misogyny in the movie because the nerds also do a panty raid. The irony is that I thought more people that lean to the left would be more sympathetic towards the nerds being ""outcasts"" themselves.Apparently feminists and white knights always have the need to be the victim.I bought this movie on Blu Ray because knowing how the left is, this movie may not be around for much longer.",Revenge of the Nerds

91,yashvardhan,30 years old and still going strong !!,10,6 June 2014,"It has been 30 years ,since the movie has released and it shows. This movie feels like a 1980s movie in each and every way.And the fact that since that since the emergence of The Big Bang Theory and Joss Whedon, nerds have become a part of mainstream. Thus, the movie shows how much time has changed. Despite these facts, the movie has aged very well.For a guy who was not present in 1980s and watched for the first time in 2014, I must say that movie has aged pretty well.After ""Animal House"" became a hit in 1978, many R-rated sex comedy came in 1980s like Porky, Risky Business and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. They were quite funny, but sometimes they took themselves seriously at a time. Seriousness worked flawlessly in Risky Business, but it felt mismatched in Porky and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This is not the case here. Sure it has all the typical T&A Teen Sex Gross-out ingredient like sex jokes, men peeking at naked girls, drugs, booze, partying, F- word, toilet humor and of course gratuitous frontal nudity,but the fact that movie never takes itself seriously sets it apart. The director of movie knew he was not making another ""The Graduate"", but a very stupid comedy and he did not hide this fact with serious topics like racism(Porky) or abortion(Fast Times).The plot is very simple and you can guess from it's title. The title clearly specifies that nerds take revenge from jocks. Nerd represent nerd and jocks represent jocks. Nothing symbolic here. One of the best thing about movie is it 's character. Just like the film itself characters are slapstick and cartoonish. For e.g.; there is a character named Ogre, who behaves like Marvel superhero Hulk. Only difference is that Hulk is green skinned and has more hair. But the character that steals the show here is Booger. His role here is to be disgusting. Be it burping,eating dirty things or as you can guess from his name taking out his booger ! Booger is played by same guy who played Tom Cruise 's best friend in Risky Business and gave what the f--- speech.The movie is often accused of it's misogyny, but I am at movie 's defense here since a) movie is equal offender. It offends every one . Be it male or female,nerds or jocks, gays or rebels. b)girls were also nasty towards ""nerds"" and thus nerds had lame excuse to take revenge and c) it was 1980s. It was in trend for movie of similar genre to be sexist. At least it is not MASH.",Revenge of the Nerds

93,DeclanCochran,"As John Hughes-esque 80's comedies go, this is by no means the worst.",6,31 May 2011,"Say what you like about comedies from the 80's, by and large, they generally had a lot of heart. And Revenge of the Nerds is no exception. Characterisation is scant, jokes obvious, dialogue clichéd, and performances running the gamut from bad to worse. Yet it is the heart to this film that made me keep watching, long after I normally would have switched off.At times it is nasty natured, that I give you (I'm fairly sure the protagonists voyeuristic acts in the girls dorm is illegal), and it doesn't exactly paint the youth of any generation in a good light (this was 1984; things have only gotten worse), but the main thing that kept drawing me in was the romance between Anthony Edwards and Michelle Meyrink as Gilbert and Judy. They have chemistry, they're cute, they work together. They're kind of at the centre of this film, and it's a good centre to have.The plot doesn't really matter, because it's just an excuse for some set pieces and punchlines, but at times it seems like the writers have looked at certain scenarios, and stuck the same punchline on each of them (David Carradines nasal, annoying, yet amusing laugh).I did find it a little hard to believe that David Carradine would pull with campus hotty Betty Childs, played by Julia Montgomery in a performance that doesn't really require any acting skill other than the ability to deliver lines saucily, and to not be embarrassed when she gets her breasts out (she does both of these). However I did find it a little hard to believe that she would be won over by Carradine because he is good at sex, and when he said that all nerds think about is sex, which is why he was so good at it, this provided a contradiction with earlier dialogue from him, as well as a complete non-truth.This, and the fact that a character such as Ogre (Donald Gibb) would be in a university at all, are the only real bum notes the film pulls. I did also have a problem with some of the nudity, as it felt out of place, and gave this film an 'R' rating when it probably would have grossed a lot more with a PG-13. As I have mentioned, a lot of the acts in this film are illegal.Pluses include the wonderfully rebellious 'Booger', played to perfection by Curtis Armstrong, the final speech, delivered to Queen's 'We Are The Champions', and a party that begins as an awkward affair, and descends into a drug-fuelled orgy (remember kids, drugs are bad!).At times it is a little hard to know who the audience for this film is, because it is an incredibly sweet movie, with a message that is good for kids, yet it has, as I have mentioned, scenes of nudity, drug taking, and a bestiality joke that made me feel a little uncomfortable.Yet there is a nice message here, and the ensemble pulls it off nicely (if you can forgive the horrendous gay stereotyping). I'd put it in front of The Great Outdoors and behind Planes, Trains, and Automobiles on a sliding scale, and that is not bad company to be in.7 stars.",Revenge of the Nerds

As they attempt to go to school in a jock run college getting picked on is nothing special. Good job on this movie 23 years later and can still be enjoyed by people around the globe. If your not into 80's classic comedies. This movie will most likely NOT be for you.",Revenge of the Nerds
96,NerdofHorror,The best comedy mankind has ever seen!,10,20 July 2003,"I remember the first time i saw Revenge of the Nerds. It had been a very boring day and when i went to my room to watch TV i saw that Revenge of tje Nerds was on. I had seen commersial for it earlier that week and from the inpression i got it seemed like another crappy teen comedy. I was wrong....VERY WRONG! The result was the best comedy i've seen.
The story in it is just as important as the film itself. It shows us that nerds are people to. I've always had a problem with nerds, but after i saw this film i wanted to be be one myself. The movie is full og laughs and is very good directed. Great acting from the underrestemated Carradine and Tony Edwards including all the other fantastic nerds!Revenge of the Nerds is a film that always will stand close to my passion for movies since it's one of the few comedys i actually like. Very much recomendend!10/10",Revenge of the Nerds
97,kulick84-195-974219,No Huge Laugh Out Loud Moments But Still a Greta Movie,7,29 June 2012,When I heard about Revenge of the Nerds I didn't know what to expect. When I watched the movie it was completely different then I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it. From the opening of this movie you know it's going to be cheesy as all hell which is by no means a bad thing. There weren't a lot if any moments where I laughed out loud however I was grinning like an idiot for most of the movie. It's a stupid movie but yet so enjoyable. The characters in the movie where well done especially Booger who was my favourite in the film. Overall Revenge of the Nerds isn't a bad movie but it also isn't this fantastic comedy full of laughs. It's a fun movie but there are better comedies. Check it out if you enjoy cheesy 80s films.,Revenge of the Nerds
98,jeremy_beach,A dream,10,29 August 2004,"This movie is a dream for a person like myself. It's my anthem because I grew up as that pathetic little nerd. It's an amazingly funny and good-hearted film. It has a couple of the greatest pranks ever seen and in my opinion it is the best ever college raunchy comedy (although animal house is close). It's a good message that even the losers will have their day in life and the last scene with the musical performance is spine tingling. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again, and although it isn't appropriate for some ages, at a point I think that every single individual should go and see this movie. It is one of the original raunchy comedies and a pioneer that all individuals who enjoy raunchy comedy should respect. Without it there are a lot of comedies we wouldn't have now days. And remember, the nerds will have their days and the revolution is coming.Jeremy",Revenge of the Nerds

105,heathermendick,Nerdiness used as an excuse for misogyny,1,5 October 2013,"The 1980s were different times in terms of gender politics, but even by 80s standards, this film is horribly misogynistic. In it a group of college men put video cameras into a women's sorority house and sit around watching the footage all night, celebrating each time they see a female student's breasts or snatch. It gets worse. In order to win a college competition, they sell photographs of one of the women topless. It gets worse. One of the men tricks this same woman into having sex with him by dressing in the costume her boyfriend is wearing. This rape, is not simply treated comedically (like the other sexism), but the victim enjoys it so much she ditches her boyfriend and decides to go out with her attacker. The men involved in all these events are the heroes of the film. As nerds, the film positions them as the victims of discrimination and harassment from the jocks. As viewers, we are clearly invoked to desire and enjoy their revenge against their oppressors. Yet, their most extreme acts of revenge are enacted against the women. Women who are given little or no characterisation. These nerd heroes are mostly white and middle-class, yet they are constructed like an oppressed ethnicity. The fraternity they join is all black until they open their chapter. The climax of the film is a speech in which the central nerd declares 'I'm a nerd, and I'm here tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds. I mean uh, all our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior. ... Why? Because we're smart? Because we look different? Well, we're not. I'm a nerd, and uh, I'm pretty proud of it.' This is nerd identity politics, which puts their experiences on a level with groups who unlike nerds have the weight of social structures against them (women, African Americans, LGBTQI etc). This positioning serves in the film as a cover for misogyny.",Revenge of the Nerds
106,wiskate,Pure and utter genius.,10,7 August 2002,"I am entirely bewildered by anyone even attempting to say anything bad about this movie.  Sure, the things people say about it perhaps are true, such as the offensive humor, sexism, homophobia, and even slight racism, but this is what makes it so good.  I'm sure most of you by now probably know what this movie is about, so I'm not going to get into it.What you people are missing is that the movie jokingly pokes fun at stereotypes that can, and sometimes are TRUE...such as Takashi's broken English and love for cameras, and Lamar's interesting wardrobe choices (pink leg warmers?) and limp wristed throwing style, but if you're following my point here, this is what makes the film so beautiful.

I recall as a young kid watching this film for the 1st time. The scene where the ""Tri Lambs"" get even with Miss Betty Childs and the rest of her sorority members is classic! When I was young I thought that scene was the best Nudity shot in any film. Personally, that scene still rivals many of my favorite movie clips today. Lastly, I feel bad for those people who sat through the rest of the films about the `Nerds'.The 1st movie was the best among the four. I do recommend buying the DVD; I bought the 1st and 2nd film together for $15. My favorite character was Booger and then Toshiro. By the way, look for Lamar Latrell in the movie Fear of a Black Hat.The total OPPOSITE of his character in `Nerds.'On a side note, if you're looking for a Halloween costume and you have a few other friends who are interested, the cast from ""Revenge of the Nerds"" is worth your while.5 out of 5 Stars!",Revenge of the Nerds
117,salvadominican,"Elements, Factors, and Aspects of ""Revenge of the Nerds""",7,18 June 2011,"An iconic film of the 80s, ""Revenge of the Nerds"" has served as a prototype film for many of the college films that have come out since this time frame. While we see this film as more of an afterthought in our modern era, Revenge of the Nerds was viewed as a ""breath of fresh air"" when it came to hilarity within the everyday life on a college campus. The theme of the film has mainly to do with the everyday stereotype of Jocks vs. Geeks, and the everyday struggles of the nerds at the hands of their more superior opposites. Yet mostly, the theme within this movie relates to the everyday college life of students in general.The plot mainly centers on a group of geeks trying to outsmart and establish themselves on the campus of Adams College; all while trying to avoid utter embarrassment and humiliation at the hands of the ""Jocks"". The leaders of the nerds, Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert Lowe (Anthony Edwards), are in a battle to establish the nerds into a fraternity within the campus after their frat house was overtaken by the jocks from the football team; with Stan Gable (Ted Mcginley) serving as the main antagonist from that group. What commences throughout the film from this point is a series of back and forth jock vs. nerds games that conclude with the nerds being embarrassed and humiliated the majority of the times. As the film progresses through these series of subliminal antics and humor, the culmination of the horseplay concludes within the school's ""Greek Games"", in which the nerds finally overtake the jocks from the football team and claim a final victory.While the plot centers mainly on the shenanigans of the characters, it is hard not to ignore the nature of some of the action that goes on mainly within this film. Content such as the language, brief scenes of nudity, and overall complex of the setting depicts mainly what a typical college campus was like. The acting when it came to this content is comparable only to more modern films within ""The American Pie"" films. Speaking of which, this film is pretty much a pioneer for those types of films; like ""The American Pie"" and ""Van Wilder"" sequels. In these films, the themes are pretty much the same when it comes to the hilarity that is portrayed throughout the various scenes of these films. Additionally, what makes these movies so similar in comparison is the use of the camera angles and lighting within their scenes of humor.In terms of the camera angles, there is a serious approach to extracting numerous humorous content through the use of Telephoto Lenses, Fish-Eye Lenses, and the changes of camera angles through the use of zooming and panning. Likewise, the lighting within the various environments is more contemporary than anything, but when it comes to the humor scenes, there is more of a dusk kind of look whenever the nerds are humiliated in front of others.With all these factors mentioned, ""The Revenge of the Nerds"" is indeed an 80's classic; due in large part to the way that the nature of its humor reflected to the era of the film. While seeing it now clearly shows areas of old school, it is regardless a freshening experience due to how life is viewed without the modernism that we are accustomed to in today's world. In essence, this is simply just a movie about a group of new students who do not fit in any of the other social groups because they are fat, not attractive or nerdy group together and form their own fraternity. And although it does suffer from a predictable storyline, it is still an enjoyable movie. To fully enjoy this movie you need to appreciate, and be a fan of 80s comedies otherwise this may not appeal to you. This movie is definitely not for children or those who don't like bad language or nudity. However if you enjoyed other 80s style comedies this should appeal to you.",Revenge of the Nerds
118,KoalaPig,An 80s American Classic that makes me glad I grew up elsewhere.,2,1 February 2014,"Before anybody gets offended by the above summary, I just want to say that I like many things about America and its culture, conversely there are things I dislike. A lot of the latter were highlighted in the film ""Revenge of the Nerds"". Also, just to avoid the wrath of the blindly patriotic, I am by no means saying that other countries and cultures don't have their share of downfalls too.So, to back to the film Due to its age, (30 years), one can possibly, (yet begrudgingly), forgive some of the casual racism and homophobia used to gain cheap laughs. However the film really hits rock bottom with its multiple scenes/sub-plots that show sexual abuse in an entirely positive light.There is a highly unlikely, yet possible, chance that the above could be overlooked if the film's humour compensated for the offensiveness, or if the rapey/homophobic/racist plot elements were done tongue in cheek – BUT THEY WEREN'T – in spite of what people might claim.Now-a-days I watch certain things, which I enjoy to various degrees, but make me yearn for my stoner days as I know my amusement would be amplified. ROTN does not even offer me this. I watched it as it is regarded as a ""classic"" and is referenced to in many other shows. In summation: I wish I hadn't bothered – 2/10.",Revenge of the Nerds

Revenge of the nerds is one of those movies that came out of the mid eighties with the stereotypical eighties style. You have short shorts, high socks, those michael jackson jackets and even commodore computer systems. The ending is one of the best ever, but then again, I am a nerd, an I'm proud of it.

Worst of all, the woman who was essentially raped then falls head over heels over her rapist, because the sex was so good. WHAT. By comparison, the pranks against the men are much more benign and don't seem to happen nearly as often (even though the conflicts primarily occur between the men, it's the women who seem to pay for it.)

122,pjazar,Excellent movie in many ways...,9,7 August 2007,"I have seen this movie several times and since it has been out it does stand the test of time even with the dated music, pot issues etc... I love this movie for many reasons. It is well acted..and a great feel good movie-- if you are in a bad funk, watch it and you will be smiling in no time. I am a female so personally I could care less about the nudity involved but the theme is genius. The party scene was a classic. Sadly they would never have something in a teen movie like this today. The nerd topic has really never been touched upon like this until now and in a way that even the most clueless athlete could understand-- People have feelings and everyone has a little of everything in them. So many people have had miserable experiences in school and although we all knew about it no one cared in the schools if they were tortured verbally or ostricized and it was never really acknowledged in this depth in a movie. The movie is not THAT deep-- but it gets points across without being aware and without being preachy ( until the end-- which was too sappy IMO --that is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10) It is satirical as it gets the point across well. Nerds deserve to be treated with respect and have so much to offer to the world and do-- but are always unappreciated. Even the jocks do see and are truthfully jealous of the nerds when they see how their abilities ( fixing up the house and their awesome inventions etc) have an advantage. They might even like the nerds but would never admit it. As silly and juvenile as these plots seem they are genius in the fact that they are explored in this movie in a unique way. I could watch this movie over and over-- I have seen it at least 15x since 1988. I do not own it now bc one of my kids friends borrowed it and I never received it back... :) Stay away from the sequels-- nothing to compare to the original....",Revenge of the Nerds
