0,MartinHafer,Well made but most folks simply won't care....and I sure had a hard time caring about this one.,5,6 March 2012,"This film is about a portion of the lives of Carl Jung, Sabina Spielrein and Sigmund Freud. It focuses mostly on Jung--beginning when he began to work with a VERY seriously emotionally disturbed woman (Spielrein). Now, considering by most accounts Spielrein was insane, you would not suspect that Jung would begin sleeping with her (and having a sado-masochistic relationship in the process) nor would you suspect that Jung and Freud would later push her to become a psychotherapist herself!!! Clearly, these were NOT the 'good old days' in the field of psychiatry!! I am rather surprised that they ever made ""A Dangerous Method"". While films do not need to be blockbusters or Oscar-bait to be worth seeing, so much about this film lacks appeal for the average viewer. First, most folks really couldn't care less about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung (especially Jung). There work is, for the most part, ancient history as far as psychiatry goes. While they made some great early advances in the field, so much of what they proposed turned out to be wrong or misguided. Now I am NOT a Freud or Jung hater--just an ex-psychotherapist who realizes that many of theories and techniques are seriously outdated. Second, neither was particularly likable. Freud was sexually obsessed/repressed and was highly inflexible and insecure. Jung was incredibly unprofessional and had the morals of a rutting pig. Third, the film is a bit slow and would appeal mostly to people who really want to see grim people misbehaving. If this sound like what you'd like to see, then by all means watch it. Just be forewarned--it's very adult and difficult to enjoy.",A Dangerous Method
1,TheLittleSongbird,Dangerous desire,6,10 June 2019,"David Cronenberg was my main reason for seeing 'A Dangerous Method'. While not one of my all time favourite directors, he is a very unique and truly admirable one and find a good deal to like about all his films, even the ones that don't do a lot for me overall. The cast was also a selling point, with Viggo Mortensen in particular being so excellent in his previous two films with Cronenberg, and love Howard Shore's music.'A Dangerous Method' is certainly above average and intriguing enough, but for Cronenberg and considering that it was exploring yet another challenging subject with the intent to unsettle it was somewhat disappointing. Not one of his worst, it is better than 'Stereo', 'Crimes of the Future' and 'Cosmopolis'. It's no 'The Fly', 'Dead Ringers', 'Eastern Promises', 'A History of Violence' or 'Dead Zone' either. Would personally put it somewhere in the middle, along with 'Crash' and 'M Butterfly'. Didn't hate it, didn't love it, more like respected it while wanting much more out of it.There are a lot of good things here. For one thing it looks fantastic, beautifully shot with handsomely evocative production and costume design. The landscapes are just gorgeous to watch and the editing is suitably slick. Shore's score is haunting and has an emotional edge as well, which is what is so great about Shore's collaborations with Cronenberg. Parts of the script are very thought-provoking and intelligently written and the story did mostly start off promisingly, with signs of subtle unsettlement.Most of the performances are fine, with Michael Fassbender's quiet intensity dominating the film beautifully. An underused but very charismatic Viggo Mortensen more than matches him and steals all his scenes actually. Vincent Cassel is memorably serpentine.Keira Knightley however is over-taxed in her role and over-compensates painfully. Cronenberg's direction is great on a technical level but is too restrained and surprisingly emotionally cold, something that is expected from first starting out but this is late Cronenberg where many times previously he proved that he could shock and move.Found the story to be too often pedestrian in pace and jumpy structurally in the latter stages of the film, and what should have been the central relationship, which should have been the most interesting aspect, to be criminally underdeveloped. Much more depth to the characters would have been more welcome too, all of them are too sketchy. The worst aspect of 'A Dangerous Method' is the very superficial and too talky script that has too many ideas and undercooks all of them. This was a brave and challenging subject given too restrained and tame treatment.In summation, above average but should have been much more. 6/10",A Dangerous Method
2,Leofwine_draca,A routine effort,5,17 August 2020,"David Cronenberg is certainly a director who's struggled to make entertaining films in the past decade, and it says something that A DANGEROUS METHOD, although strictly average, is by far the best of them. It's a coldly clinical look at the relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and the way they came together over a female patient whom the latter grew particularly close to. This is essentially an actor's showcase, with Cronenberg regular Viggo Mortensen giving a solid performance as Freud and Michael Fassbender good enough as Jung, but the real focus is on Keira Knightley, tackling a very difficult role as a woman given over to outbursts of derangement, all contorted features and jutting jaw. It would be a difficult role for anyone to play and I do think Knightley makes a fine effort. But the script feels routine and never more than superficially interesting, and Cronenberg's attempts to shock with some explicit sexuality are laughable more than anything.",A Dangerous Method
3,SnoopyStyle,Clinical feel,6,19 July 2014,"It's 1904. Hysterical Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) is sent to Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) in Zurich for treatment. She has psychological sexual problems based on her violent father. He has a cold clinical relationship with his wife Emma (Sarah Gadon). The older Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is the elder statesman to Jung but he's starting to chaff at the paternal relationship. Freud sends a new patient Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel) to Jung. Spielrein's treatment goes so well that she eventually becomes a psychiatrist herself. The close working relationship translates into a sexual relationship.This has great director David Cronenberg, great actors, and a fascinating history. The acting is top notch. Keira Knightley is going over the top. There are lots to like but I find this too lifeless. I may be bias against psychoanalysis and discussing about emotions rather than just feeling the emotions. It's not cinematic. But this is Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud afterall. I don't think there is anyway to make it any more exciting. The clinical world just makes the passions feel very clinical.",A Dangerous Method
4,nogodnomasters,SEX WITH PATIENTS IS AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD,8,22 August 2018,"Based on a true story and highly influenced by the 2002 discovery of letters and diary of Sabina Spielrein.Keira Knightley shines magnificently as Sabina Spielrein, a spastic, neurotic, but highly intelligent patient of the young Swiss doctor Carl Jung (methodically played by Michael Fassbender). While she is neurotic her intellect still reasons. In an early scene Sabina is in a pond as the men in white coats try to persuade her out.The clinic director approaches her and says ""You clearly have too much time on your hands. We must find something for you to do. What are your interests?""Sabina, ""Suicide and interplanetary travel."" In this simple scene we can grasp her intellect and her issues.Jung allows Sabina, (who wants to be a doctor) to act as his assistant, a task she does a little too well as demonstrated with her diagnosis of patients using word association. Sabina has been abused by her father. Now it gets weird. He would slap her, then make her kiss his hand afterwards. He would also spank her bare bottom, something Keira confesses caused arousal, even at an early age. She would do things which would cause her to be spanked.Carl Jung decides to consult some guy named Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) about this case. Mortensen plays Freud somewhat stiff, for a guy who relates everything to sex. When cocaine snorting, womanizer patient (Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross) shows up at the clinic, his unethical ways cause Jung to question his life and his relationship with Knightly who now desires sex and a good spanking.Freud is always pictured with a cigar in his hand or mouth(sometimes a cigar is just a cigar), but his other idiosyncrasies are not captured. Note the German custom of wearing the wedding ring on the right hand. He is involved in a lot of dialogue scenes about sex, repression, ego, and dream interpretation. What should be a five star movie from the cast, lacks action in the script and good drama in the dialogue, but does have an historical interest.

5,kosmasp,Slightly dangerous,7,27 September 2012,"While I understand that the movie was not received as well as Cronenberg would have wanted, it is a very difficult movie to sell. Not because of the actors! Actually my first thought was: three of the best guys of their generation and Keira Knightley -> Awesome! But Mr. Cassel himself a smaller part, so it's only Fassbender and Mortensen left. But they both do a great job depicting ... let's call them ""persons of interest"". People most of us have some idea of.So this movie goes very philosophical on us and is very ""talky"". But still as other reviewers have pointed out. Nothing much is happening. I guess that was the point of it all to begin with though. It is about talking life, instead of living/experiencing. Or against to be more exact. Latter being sort of represented by Keiras character. A more subtle approach than most would wish for, but still a good movie",A Dangerous Method
6,gavin6942,A Strong Cronenberg,8,1 August 2013,"A look at how the intense relationship between Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) gives birth to psychoanalysis.You cannot beat Cronenberg in his element, when he is exploring his love of the clinical. The themes here go back to his earliest work of almost fifty years ago... and he nails it.I must say the male leads are incredible, with Mortensen really becoming Freud and Fassbender being a quite sympathetic character. Keira Knightley's accent and overacting were a turn-off, but perhaps we should blame the person who cast her.What this film did more than anything was make me want to learn more about the real life Jung and Freud, which is certainly not a bad thing.",A Dangerous Method
7,rmax304823,Just Say Whatever Comes Into Your Mind.,6,8 June 2013,"The world is full of mysteries.One of them is how in hell a tiny country like Switzerland could come up with so many famous psychiatrists in such a brief period -- not just Jung, but Bleuler, Rorschach, Piaget, Claparède, Kübler-Ross, Szondi, and the ever-popular Jules Angst. At least we know what drove Jules to an attempt to deconstruct the mind. Not everyone will recognize all of the names but psychiatrists and psychologists will find them famous, except for Szondi, who invented the ""Szondi test"" and is better described as ""infamous"".This is a slow, talky, elliptical movie and is sometimes dull, but it's a big improvement over most of David Cronenberg's other works, like ""Videodrome."" (Ugh.) Although Jung (Fassbender, who here looks like Kevin Kline) is the central figure, it's not really his biography. And it's not really the story of the gradual estrangement of Jung and Freud (Mortensen), a story better handled in a miniseries some years ago starring David Suchet. It's more the story of Jung's affair with one of his patients, Sabina Spielrein (Knightly), who was turned on while being spanked. (Let us not be judgmental.) It's an on-and-off affair, before she takes off on her own and becomes a shrink herself.If you like love stories with philosophical harmonies, this should suit you. Listening to the disputes, from today's perspective, they sound like Medieval arguments about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. During sex, must one overcome his own ego defense in order to achieve a transcendental union with a beloved partner? I don't know. How about masturbation, where the actor and the beloved partner are one and the same? Do knotholes in pine fences figure into this somehow? The acting is quite good on everyone's part. The most difficult role belongs to Keira Knightley, who isn't afraid to make herself look ugly on screen. We see her first as a raving lunatic, spastic, her chin jutting out like Burt Lancaster's, screaming and jumping into muddy ponds. By the end, married and pregnant, she almost achieves serenity but not completely. Her eyes are dark and penetrating and she preserves in her demeanor a sense that she could begin howling again and never stop.Fassbender is fine, too, as the bourgeois provoked beyond endurance by a sexy and willing babe. Freud dropped Jung out of his circle because Jung insisted on introducing mystical explanations for behavior instead of sticking to Freud's ""scientific"" methods. Freud was right about that. There is a kind of Jung cult today but he was nuts. He spent a year or so wandering around his stone castle carving symbols that meant nothing to anyone but himself. One of his earliest visions was God squatting over a church and dropping a turd on it. And then he very carefully laid out some bizarre visions in ""the red book."" Most of this is elided, leaving Carl a dull boy.There are other inconsistencies. Not that they matter much. One seems to have been introduced to support the dramatic structure. Aboard the ship to America, Freud tantalizes Jung by saying that he had a very rich dream last night, but then refuses to reveal what it was because it might undermine his authority. Actually, if I recall, Freud must have told Jung what was up because Jung described the dream in his later writings. On the other hand, when interviewed shortly before his death, Jung revealed that, yes, he had heard the dream but he wouldn't tell what it was because of doctor/patient confidentiality, even though Freud had been dead for twenty years.So it's slow and talky. But Keira Knightley's savage performance stands out and so, in a far more contained way, do Fassbender's and Mortensen's. That's important because the performances are probably the most magnetic elements of the movie.Best Quote From Carl G. Jung: ""Show me a sane man and I will cure him for you.""",A Dangerous Method
8,blanche-2,not very involving,6,25 November 2013,"If you're a psychiatrist, you'll probably enjoy the ideas tossed around in ""A Dangerous Method,"" a 2011 film starring Viggo Mortenson, Keira Knightley, and Michael Fassbender. The film was adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play, which starred Ralph Fiennes in London.It's the story of Jung (Fassbender), Freud (Mortenson) and a patient of Jung's, Sabina Spielrein (Knightley). Spielrein is brought into an institution as a patient while Jung was working there, and he treated her. Spielrein is very intelligent and wants to be a doctor. Eventually she becomes Jung's lover, and later on, his colleague. Interested in the work of Freud, she begins a correspondence with him.What we're taken through here are Jung's close relationship with Freud, which ends as their ideas grow farther and farther apart; and his relationship with Spielrein. Once they become lovers, he feels guilty as he's never cheated on his wife, he breaks off his affair, only to take up with her again when they're working together on her dissertation.Most of the facts given in the film are true; how much of this drama and angst is true, I don't know. And to be honest, all of the theories both men put forth about their work were dry and difficult to follow unless you happen to be in the field. Freud's view of man was much narrower: he believed in sex and work. Jung's theories took in dream interpretation, astrology, sociology, east and west religions - he was more of a mystic. Freud considered Jung the ""son"" or the ""crown prince"" who would carry on his work, but it was not to be, as Jung went off in his own direction. Jung really set the stage for the new age movement that was to come.The problem with this film is that you don't care, period. You don't care about Jung, Freud, Spielrein, or psychiatry. The acting is good but it's really hard to relate to any of these people.Spielrein apparently went on to train many psychiatrists; she and her two children were killed by the Nazis. Jung lived until 1961, outliving his wife and mistress Toni Wolff. Freud was older and died in 1939.This film was directed by David Cronenberg, an excellent director, but perhaps not for this material. It might work better on stage.

9,edwagreen,A Dangerous Method **1/2 It's All Because of the Opposite Sex,6,20 September 2012,"I finally found something almost as boring as my high school chemistry class with a certain female teacher. It's the discussion of psychoanalysis, in its foundation, in this 2011 film.Could you imagine having the Keira Knightley lady that she is portraying as a lunatic brought to an asylum by Dr. Jung, and suddenly she is helping him in his analysis of others and then becomes a child psychologist? The only reason this seemed to have all occurred was because the script said so.I will say that Knightley is absolutely amazing as the patient turned analyst. Her mood swings as she progresses in becoming so called normal are memorable.Given the period of time that the movie occurs, it's quite indecent that Jung and the Knightley character become lovers.To me, the best part of the film was when the credits were rolling and they told you what became of the characters as the years went on. Happy it was not. That's just the history in me.Jung had his dreams of the upcoming conflagration of World War 11. There are subtle hints about being Jewish in Europe during this period, some 20 years before the rise of Nazism.",A Dangerous Method

13,Boba_Fett1138,The movie does a good job....at telling you absolutely nothing!,6,27 March 2012,"A movie about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud directed by David Cronenberg? That sounds surprising and interesting, to say the very least but the movie as it turned out, was far from anything interesting to watch.There are really multiple causes. The first and foremost problem is obviously with its story. And not just only the story in itself but also the things its emphasizes and puts its focus on. It makes some bad choices with this, which makes this movie feel like a very dry and distant one.The movie is mostly focusing on the 'romance' between Jung and his mental patient, played greatly by Keira Knightley. Nothing wrong with that, if only the romance was anything really romantic or something to feel involved with. It instead just feels wrong and dirty and besides isn't made all that believable. Why, out of all of his patients and opportunities he must have had in his life, does Carl Jung suddenly decide to have an affair with this particular woman? What was so different or intriguing about her? This movie really doesn't give you the answers to any of this.And if you think that this movie is being one that is sort of showing the rivalry between Freud and Jung and their opposing psychology methods, you are completely wrong. There is never any interesting dynamic between the two of them, which is granted also due to the fact that Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, is hardly in the movie at all.And don't know what their methods were and why there are still being used in today's psychoanalysis and why the both of them are being regarded as the two founding fathers of psychoanalysis? Don't expect this movie to show or tell you anything! It really remains on the surface all, as if it was afraid for its own subject and that it might loose some of its viewers with it.In other words, the movie really isn't telling you anything interesting and it's mostly being an unusual romantic movie, you'll get very little out off.All a same really, since the movie itself remains well made and acted out. It's a pretty good looking movie, with all of its historical sets and costumes and the actor's play their roles convincingly. It at least still makes the movie watchable but it's barely enough to keep you interested in it.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Dangerous Method
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Among their best work,7,21 June 2012,"In 1904, Dr. Jung(Fassbender who looks the part perfectly, and who imbues it with a youthful curiosity that struggles against its polite upbringing) wants to try out his ""speech therapy""(what we would call psycho-analysis), and he feels he's found the perfect subject for it in new patient Sabina Spielrein(Knightley giving an unforgettable and immensely brave(outdoing Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia) performance, at first completely primal and yet frail, and she developers over the course of this, always very convincing). But what will the consequences of taking her on be? Through this, Freud(Mortensen, always with a cigar in hand or mouth, with a genuine authority to him, in spite of his stubbornness) and Otto Gross(Cassel, whose seductive presence in this is sadly very small, as a man who gives in to his every whim, and is treated to the strongest character introduction) are also brought in, and all four(!) get to explain their view on the human psyche(at times it's even outright debated between any two of them), and the film never takes a side or judges any behavior. We see the outcomes of their views, as well as how our lead, Carl(the most open of them all), is affected in no small way by the other three, over the course of it, and from that, we may make up our own minds. This captures the difficulty of maintaining the strict relationship between psychologist and patient, even to the point of them completely swapping roles several times. This is dialog-heavy, and many ideas are communicated, but it doesn't lose us because it is intertwined with the intrigue of their personal lives... it is not purely theoretical. The authenticity is aided by all the real-life locations used, and the credibility is high throughout. As my father and I was walking home from the theater, we both felt an urge to look even deeper into the works of these 4 thinkers - I suggest that this is one of the greatest accomplishments possibly to such a film. There is a lot of sexuality(half spoken about, half seen, if only fairly graphic, with a little female topless nudity - it is a Cronenberg picture, albeit with no violence), some disturbing content and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone open to the field of psychology. 7/10",A Dangerous Method
15,evanston_dad,Shouldn't a Movie About Sex Be Sexier Than This?,6,20 January 2012,"""A Dangerous Method"" pairs two good actors, Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen, with one not very good actress, Keira Knightley, in a rather inconsequential film about the rivalry between Karl Jung (Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen) and the young woman (Knightley) that brought the two psychoanalysts together.It's an overly talky film, and director David Cronenberg, who you can usually count on to at least make his films visually interesting, does little to overcome the material's origins as a stage play (by Christopher Hampton, who also did the adaptation). Fassbender and Mortensen are very good (just watching what Mortensen can do with a cigar is almost worth the price of admission), but the film is greatly undermined by Knightley, who simply is not up to the task of playing a woman with acute psychological problems. Her character is all over the map, and I'm not sure whether that's the fault of the screenplay or her performance -- maybe the whole thing would have made more sense with a different actress in the role.Cronenberg was clearly drawn to the material because of its obsession with sex, and more particularly with mankind's obsessions with sex, and his constant struggles to control urges that perhaps weren't ever meant to be controlled. But though the film certainly isn't as cold and clinical as Cronenberg's movies frequently are, neither does it generate much heat.Grade: B-",A Dangerous Method
16,ferguson-6,Dueling Brilliant Loony's,7,26 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. This film and story is yet more confirmation for my life-long belief that, in general, psychiatrists and psychologists tend to be the most unstable and consistently loony people in society. Whether in the medical profession, business world or scientific realm, over-blown ego affects judgment and clarity; and sometimes leads to the mis-guided notion that proving one's theory is more vital than finding real truth.Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) are considered the founding fathers of what we accept today as psychoanalysis. In this film, we see how the two men came to know each other and the subsequent prideful battle of egos that drove them apart. Just as importantly, we see how Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) evolved from hysteria sufferer in 1904 (as the film opens), to Jung's patient, to Jung's lover, and finally to the level of respected colleague of Freud and Jung within the field. Her growth and change as a patient provided clinical proof to ""the talking cure"" method, which took the place of electro-shock therapy (except in extreme cases).The film is directed by David Cronenberg, although you might not believe it if you didn't know it to be so. Mr. Cronenberg is known for such work as ""The Fly"", ""Eastern Promises"" and ""A History of Violence"". This is easiest his most dialogue-intensive work to date. Of course, that makes sense given that it's based on Christopher Hampton's play ""The Talking Cure"" and John Kerr's book ""A Most Dangerous Method"". The two main subjects love to hear their own words, though here Freud spends much of his screen time puffing a cigar and tossing in a few well-timed grunts. This goes to his belief that silence often leads others to conclude that his theories are so solid, debate becomes unnecessary.It is very interesting to see the personality differences between the subdued Freud and the more open-minded Jung. When mystical and supernatural subjects are brought up by Jung, Freud quickly dismisses them as hooey. Freud was almost a master marketer is his attempts to get psychoanalysis accepted into mainstream. He fought Jung's more exploratory ideas. At the heart of the film is the evolution of Sabina and it's impact on the three leads. There is also a bit of Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel) thrown in to show just how open Jung could be.Learning about these pioneers is crucial to understanding the topic of today's psychiatry and psychology. There is no question that the foundation of their work led to the salvation of many suffering people over the years. Of course, it's clear that many patients have also suffered at the hands of those in the field who are less scrupulous.The look of the film is beautiful, as are the costumes and sets. An added bonus is the terrific score from Howard Shore. It's difficult to see this one attracting a wide audience, but the performances and subject matter should please those who are drawn to it.",A Dangerous Method

The subject matter is fascinating, but the play and screenplay on which it was based are not good. It concentrated too much on the salacious nature of the sexual relationship and not enough on the cure and the ideas of the men. The dialog was not very well written. It's for more mature audiences because of the explicit nature of the story. Many parts felt slow. Kiera gives an intense performance both in the mental breakdown and then the love affair. Maybe she could have dialed it back a bit in the earlier scenes. She had a strange accent but is very watchable. Michael Fassbender is very versatile. He blends easily into any role he plays and looks the part of an older man. Viggo Mortensen while not looking physically like Freud (maybe too robust), acts and speaks quite differently from usual. The filming in Germany (for Switzerland) and Austria looks beautiful and inviting. Costumes and sets are good. Overall worth a watch for the stars and the subject matter but be prepared to be disappointed it's just not a very good movie.",A Dangerous Method
18,gradyharp,"'Experiences like this, however painful, unnecessary and inevitable, without them, how can we know life?' Sigmund Freud",9,28 March 2012,"A DANGEROUS METHOD offers the audience a look at the beginnings of psychoanalysis by presenting the lives of four important doctors at eh turn of the 20th century. The film is adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play 'The Talking Cure' which in turn was a dramatization of John Kerr's book 'A Most Dangerous Method'. An interesting aspect of the film is that it is primarily a film about discussions embroidered with enough action to make it cinematic. It is beautiful to watch, a pleasure to hear (Howard Shore's musical score consists of 'arrangements' of themes form the operas of Richard Wagner with an emphasis on the 'Siegfried Idyll' which as a work with its own similar history that plays exceptionally well into this story), a challenge to absorb in the hands of director David Cronenberg, and a showcase for some fine acting.The film opens in 1904 with Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) accepting as a patient young Russian émigré Sabina Spielberg (Kiera Knightley) who is a tortured soul from a past abusive upbringing. We are like a fly on the wall, observing Sabina's neurotic/psychotic behavior as Jung begins to tame her: their gradually successful treatment results in an affair both emotional and physical despite the fact that Jung is married to Emma (Sarah Gadon) and has children and also despite the fact that Jung believes the doctor/patient relationship should be respected. Meanwhile off in Vienna Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is gaining acclaim for this psychoanalytic work and refers a patient of his, a fellow analyst Dr. Otto Gross (Vinvent Cassell) whose extreme sexual acting out has gained notoriety. Jung accepts Gross as a patient and from the stance of the story, Jung learns more form Gross than Gross benefits from Jung: apparently Jung's libido is encouraged and that urges him to act out with Sabina, now able to respond to the world in a manner so appropriate that she becomes a medical student and eventually a psychiatrist also. The story also examines the coming together and the eventual parting of ways between Jung and Freud and it is this part of the film that becomes more significantly and satisfyingly cerebral. It is this intense relationship between Freud and Jung that gives us a quality understanding of the birth of psychoanalysis.Though the opening scenes of the film - those that focus on the outrageous behavioral changes in Sabina - becoming trying on the nerves, the remainder of the film is intellectually satisfying. Kiera Knightley stumbles with her Russian accent and tends to take her character's mental aberrations too far, but otherwise she is excellent in her role. Both Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen offer elegant and understated characterizations of these two important men in the history of medicine. Vincent Cassell and Sarah Gadon are also exceptional in their acting. Providing more in depth studies of both Freud and Jung would have been welcome, but in the confines of a film we at least are allowed insights into the minds of these two men.

19,zetes,Mediocre Oscar bait. Certainly not worthy of Cronenberg's talent.,6,10 April 2012,"David Cronenberg has spent most of the last decade - actually even longer - receding from the horror scene. The last film in the genre he made was arguable 1999's eXistenZ. His three films of the previous decade, Spider, A History of Violence and Eastern Promises, were too good to get worried about it. His new film, however, is worrisome. This is out-and-out middlebrow Oscar bait (which didn't work, incidentally). To boot, it's not that good. Okay, maybe, but certainly it's forgettable. The film is about the relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung (Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender, respectively). Jung has become involved with a patient (Kiera Knightley) whom he is now training in psychoanalysis. Their sexual relationship threatens to derail the study. Not a bad subject for a movie, but Cronenberg doesn't find any especially interesting angle to approach it. It should at least lead to some good acting, but Cronenberg handles it all very unevenly. Knightley (perhaps because her character is Russian) utilizes an accent, Fassbender speaks in his own accent and Mortensen kind of drifts between a British and Austrian accent. Knightley, since she's playing, at least at the beginning, a hysterical woman, is about the film's only really interesting aspect. I wouldn't call her performance excellent, but it's worth seeing (and it's well worth watching just to see her get spanked several times - hot!). Mortensen is okay when his accent's not wandering. Fassbender, who starred in like five films last year, kind of proves here that he hasn't got that much talent behind his handsomeness. He's incredibly bland in this film. Go back to horror, Cronenberg, or at least crime.",A Dangerous Method
20,deloudelouvain,Psycho-analysis is boring,4,2 March 2017,To resume this movie in three short words they should be Bla Bla Bla because that's basically what you will watch for the entire seance. I do like a serious discussion about serious things in life but a thing I don't like is psycho-analysis. And because A Dangerous Method is about Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud that's what you get for the entire movie. Analyzing people or at least trying while in fact there is not much to analyze. So it quickly becomes really boring to watch. The actors are not bad though if you like that kind of boring movies but for me you could put my favorite actors in this story and it would still be crap. When you see Sabina Spielrein played by Keira Knightley acting like a total spass that can barely speak a word correctly and then suddenly evolve to another psychologist with no speaking disabilities you wonder if this movie can become any dumber. The longer I watched it the lesser I liked it. If I had to have a conversation in real life with any of those psychologists I would probably die from boredom. Like I almost did watching this movie.,A Dangerous Method
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A Dangerous Method,8,31 March 2012,"A Dangerous Method marks the third film that director David Cronenberg had collaborated with actor Viggo Mortensen, casting him as the famed Sigmund Freud in a tale that examines the relationship between three prominent scientists in the early days of psycho-analysis, with the other two being Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), set in the early 1900s, adapting from the play The Talking Cure by Christopher Hampton, which in turn was based on the non fiction book A Most Dangerous Method by John Kerr. While one of Cronenberg's most accessible films as are his other Mortensen starrers in recent years, the story based on real people provides that compelling watch as it takes the viewer on a relatively scientific journey full of hypotheses and theories on psychosis, psychiatry and sexuality even, listening keenly on heavy discussions that even the layman can pick up, and stay engaged that I won't deny may be attributed to the charismatic cast who play their real life counterparts with aplomb. Events that unfold and with scenes set in are based on real incidents, so that provides a bit of historical accuracy, albeit there's always that dramatic license adopted to tell a tale especially involving more private moments amongst the characters.Michael Fassbender, Hollywood's recent It guy, sets the stage as Carl Jung, who in his active practice in a Swiss hospital sees him introduced to Sabina the patient, brought in from Russia and having treatment by Jung using Freud's methods. A correspondence with Freud results in the two spending time with each other exchanging ideas and concepts, forming a professional friendship although Jung admits to Sabina that he's a little bit wary and apprehensive. Who wouldn't be, when one takes another's theory and sees the results obtained when utilized.It's a tale about professional rivalry, and how sometimes one's perception of friendship becomes totally jaded when feelings aren't really reciprocated in expected terms, such as when Jung shares his most intimate dreams with Freud for interpretation and analysis, much to his slight disgust for Freud's penchant for dissecting and co-relating everything in fairly sexual terms, but for the reverse to never happen because of the big fear that in doing so renders one vulnerable to the other. And this professional relationship turned rivalry under the most natural and expected terms, with Mortenssen and Fassbender disappearing into their roles thanks to heavy makeup, is what makes this somewhat like a mirror to our own personal life when we reflect upon our own friendships kept.But with Keira Knightley's Sabina Spielrein in the picture, it provided an additional complexity between the two men, especially when Jung breaks the doctor-patient relationship and enters into a more intimate, sexual one with Sabina, in a certain way also goaded and encouraged by Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel in a minor role), to whom some proponents of free love will credit him for that concept. This adulterous relationship behind the back of Jung's wife Emma (Sarah Gadon) adds a tinge of danger and destruction to the professional life of Jung as it threatens to boil over, with Sabina's emotional instability, and threats of blackmail, especially when rumours and anonymous letters start to fly, points to a difficult resolution in having to confess one's deeds to a mentor or peer. It's not an easy thing to do, and instead of physical violence as seen in the other recent Cronenberg films in A History of Violence and Eastern Promises, this one sees more of a psychological tussle and one-upmanship between the three historical characters involved.Lush in production values to bring back the early 20th century with sets, costumes, and even an ocean liner thrown in for good measure, what will result in A Dangerous Method will be that spark of interest to read up more about the true life characters involved in this story, to dig a little bit deeper into the theories they created and the ideas they each support and differ from one another. Knightley, without a signature look to hide behind, is memorable as Sabina in the introduction, fighting against her inner demons, and then growing into a confident professional complete with Russian accented English to boot.",A Dangerous Method
22,siderite,An eye opener,8,16 March 2012,"There are mixed opinions about this film, some like it, some do not. I believe the people that did not like the film expected it to provide all the narrative, either from the scientific point of view, wishing for more of the psychological theory or the dispute between Jung and Freud, or from the personal standpoint, wishing for more sex, more discussions between the people involved and reactions from the public. The truth of the matter, though, is that the film is only meant as an eye opener. It shows some facets of the people involved, it discusses a bit of the theory, but it was never meant to reveal everything.From this perspective, the film was very well done. Keira Knightley played beautifully, as well as the other actors involved, and there was a feel to the movie that made one believe it all happened in the old countries in Europe, even if all of them spoke English.Bottom line: it's a Cronenberg film. It opens your eyes, then let's you do the seeing. I liked it. It may be a little dry on the edges, but well done and very instructive.",A Dangerous Method
23,JamesHitchcock,"If you have a special interest in the history of psychological theory, this is the film for you",6,1 March 2012,"""A Dangerous Method"" would seem to be something of a departure for David Cronenberg, a director whom I had previously associated with violent or sexually explicit science-fiction and horror movies such as ""Shivers"" or ""The Fly"". It is a biopic, set in the early 20th century and made in the best ""heritage cinema"" style, of the psychologist Carl Jung, centring upon his relationship with Sabina Spielrein. Cronenberg has, however, shown an interest in psychology and psychiatry in some of his earlier films, such as ""Dead Ringers"".The relationship between Jung and Spielrein is initially one of doctor and patient. Spielrein, a Russian Jew and a medical student, was one Jung's patients whom he was treating for neurosis at his clinic in Switzerland. Later, however, they became lovers and, after Spielrein qualified as a doctor, collaborators. The film also deals with Jung's relationship with Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Jung was initially a disciple of Freud, but later developed his own methods which led to a breach between the two men, something which is dramatised here. (To simplify matters, Jung felt that Freud laid too much emphasis on sexual development and neglected influences such as religion).Those who primarily associate Cronenberg with films like ""Shivers"" will be surprised by how physically beautiful this film is, shot against the Swiss and German countryside and the city of Vienna and featuring the most sumptuous and elegant interiors and costumes, (I always have a weakness for movies set in the Edwardian era, which I regard as the last great romantic period in our history). It is also very well acted, especially by the three main leads, Viggo Mortensen as Freud, Michael Fassbender as Jung and Keira Knightley as Spielrein. Keira, of course, has plenty of experience of costume dramas, but her role here, especially during the early scenes when her character is suffering from a mental illness, is one of the most challenging she has tackled so far. There are also good contributions from Sarah Gadon, an actress I had not come across before, as Jung's beautiful, loving and tolerant wife Emma, and from Vincent Cassel as the sex-obsessed Otto Gross, a psychiatrist who seems madder than any of his patients.The main problem with the film is that it will probably appeal to a very limited audience. Anyone with a special interest in the history of psychological theory is likely to be fascinated by it. Anyone lacking such an interest, however, is likely to find it rather dull; for all its beautiful photography and for all the fine acting on display, it is rather slow-moving and dominated by lengthy intellectual conversations. If you are already knowledgeable about the differences between the Freudian and Jungian approaches to psychiatry, this is the film for you. If you are not- and I must confess that I am not particularly knowledgeable on this subject- then it probably isn't. 6/10",A Dangerous Method

25,lasttimeisaw,"A maverick in Cronenberg's cinema, a conventional drama hinges on a sturdy cast",7,4 May 2014,"While being thrilled to Cronenberg's upcoming MAPS TO THE STARS, which will debut in Cannes this year in the main competition, it is an apposite time to visit his other work which escaped my watch list although COSMOPOLIS (2012, 4/10) is a fiasco which quite disheartens my faith, luckily, A DANGEROUS METHOD is surprisingly robust in depicting a historical love affair between one of the founding fathers of psychoanalysis, Doctor Carl Yung (Fassbender) and his Russian patient Sabina Spielrein (Knightley), at the dawn of 20th Century, at the same time, the film also probes into Yung's correspondence with Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), how their assumed mentor-and-next-in-line rapport disintegrates in the wake of their diversified convictions in the professional field. The film dedicatedly shuns away from being a hagiography, neither for Yung nor for Freud, their highly dialectical discourse is stingingly gripping, Freud avers all neurosis is of exclusively sexual origin while Yung champions parapsychology, plus Vincent Cassel, has a small role as the more unorthodox psychoanalyst Otto Gross, who is a game-changer in Jung's world-view when he attempts to analyze Gross. Words are not verbose anymore, in psychotherapy, it is the most or maybe only effective means to divulge what's hidden inside the labyrinthine mind, Fassbender and Mortensen are conspicuously excellent in their two-handers, the former often blinks rapidly as if he tries to convey his ideas through an impregnable wall erected by the latter, who never loses his composure and is indomitable to any rebuttal. This film is not at all Cronenberg-esque, it is a straightforward drama, the only remotely grotesque scenes are Keira Knightley's distorted effort to mimic a patient under hysteria, she is gutsy and to say the least, all-out for a difficult role involves with sadomasochism, anal fixation and insanity, I'm not a naysayer in her performance, on the contrary, she barely misses my top 10 list of leading actress in 2011, the sexual tension between Sabina and Dr. Yung is unforced, although as unlikely as an ace among his peers, Dr. Yung would make such a blunder at the first place to fall for his patient, he has his secrets too, a libido-driven temptation is too hard to reject, the pleasure which Sabina offers cannot be achieved from his melancholic wife Emma (an underplayed Sarah Gadon), eventually he becomes a monogamy dissenter as Otto has advised. A DANGEROUS METHOD inclines to be an actor's playground rather than Cronenberg's auteurist endeavor, stemming from my self-satisfying purpose, I hope MAPS TO THE STARS will be another vehicle for its A-list cast, in the main for my goddess Moore, who can return to the brutal Oscar battle in an age when most actress are regressing to sideline offers. Maybe Cronenberg is the right turn this time.",A Dangerous Method
26,KineticSeoul,This movie is far from being a let down,8,20 August 2012,"Now I enjoyed Cronenberg's previous film ""Eastern Promises"" so I really looked forward to his latest work. Past ""Cronenberg"" films has psychological aspect to it, but this deals with some well known psychologist and the relationship between them which intrigued me even more. I thought this movie would revolve around the notorious psychologist Sigmund Freud who is the founder of psychoanalysis. But it revolves more around Carl Jung who is the founder of analytical psychology and his relationship with Sabina Spielrein, Sigmund Freud and Otto Gross. It was just interesting and engaging to watch these three well known psychologist that are interested in the human mind build relationships through what their main interest is. But if your looking for a detailed explanation of how some of them got to the point of there views on the human mind, you might be disappointed. It just shows bits and pieces of how Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein got to their views on the human mind. Carl Jung in this movie is portrayed as a character that acts righteous but does some hypocritical things. And Sigmund Freud is portrayed as someone that is very pedantic and egotistical about his theories of the human mind. So their approach is different in some areas. Carl Jung cadillac exterior phenomenon and deals with some spiritual aspects. But Sigmund Freud doesn't deal very well with sanctimonious Keira Knightley plays Sabina Spielrein, now some may agree or disagree but she had this theory of destruction and self destruction and how true sexuality comes from the destruction of the ego. I agree that Keira does seem to over act when trying to play crazy but when she becomes more calmer in this movie her acting really starts to shine. Michael Fassbender is good as Carl Jung and did a good job portraying his character that is infatuated with the human mind but also acts a bit naive sometimes. While Carl Jung is on his road to his discoveries, Sigmund Freud played by Viggo Mortensen is the scene stealer in this movie cause his acting is spot on. Proving he is a underrated versatile actor. Overall this is a intriguing movie that is worth seeing at least once, wasn't groundbreaking but it's a good movie that is more than just a love hate relationships kinda deal.8/10",A Dangerous Method
27,Irishchatter,A very good movie with Knightly and Fassbender!!!!,8,17 September 2016,"After feeling disappointed with Fassbender's movie ""Shame"", I decided to give this a watch since himself and Keira Knightley were on this so why not? I swear, Knightly really put on such good emotions for her role that, she doesn't remind me of her as Elizabeth Swan in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". She really does act like a good mental asylum patient that all horror film directors should hire!The sex scenes with her and Fassbender were so genuinely amazing that you would think of them as a real life couple in which they aren't. The fake accents were brilliant as well.Its a really good movie, it is rough at scenes but seeing Knightley and Fassbender working together is just awesome! I give this rating a 8/10!",A Dangerous Method

I say B,7,4 February 2012,"""Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable just to be able to go on living."" A woman named Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) is not acting ""normal"" so she is dropped off at the home of Dr. Carl Jung (Fassbender).

As she starts to get better he begins a different type of therapy, but his friend Sigmund Freud (Mortinsen) does not agree with his methods. This is a movie I was really not looking forward to watching. I like the actors but the premise about the ""birth of psychoanalysis"" is not something I was interested in. Halfway through I was hooked and it did keep me interested the entire time. Once again this is not a movie for everyone, but the acting and story made it a very interesting movie and by the end you have a connection with each character and the ""updates"" during the credits really seem to add to the movie. Overall, a movie that was much better then anticipated and I do recommend it. I give it a B.",A Dangerous Method
29,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,29 March 2012,"A Dangerous MethodUpon graduating with a Ph. D in Psychiatry, proud parents most likely buy their graduate a brand new couch.Unfortunately, the pioneering shrinks in this drama only have wooden chairs to sit upon while they analyze each other.When promising psychoanalyst Sabina (Keira Knightley) is put in the care of Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), one of the architects of psychoanalysis, he employs her as an assistant, while also treating her as a patient.Over endless conversations with his mentor Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and interactions with a playboy patient (Vincent Cassel), Jung ultimately decides to probe something other than Sabina's mind.Based on the non-fiction novel that scrutinizes the two masters of the mind, this sexually explicit and astute anatomize of the theory is masterfully directed by David Cronenberg.

30,ironhorse_iv,Let's dig into the mind of this movie,6,6 June 2013,"By seeing the number of trailers, it seems like the producers were marketing the film as a 'love triangle' story of two doctors, young Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and his mentor renowned Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) fighting over the love of their own patient Sabina Spielrein (Kiera Knightly). It's not like that, at all. Seduced by the challenge of an impossible case, the driven Dr. Jung takes on the hysteria unbalanced Sabina Spielrein as his patient. Looking for answer, he was driven to the answer of sex by his fellow psychoanalyst Otto Gross (Vincent Cassell) and break the unwritten rule of sex with a patient that Dr. Sigmund Freud has set up. Due to this, Sabina became more obsession with him, and tries to ruin him. Only with the help of Sigmund Freud, can Dr. Carl Jung solve this interesting thrilling problem. Great minds think alike, Author John Kerr spend 8 years examination of the relationship between Jung, Spielrein and Freud. Director David Cronenberg took John Kerr's book, and with help by screenwriter Christopher Hampton present us, the audience, an film about the founding fathers of Psychoanalysis. The film narrative the birth of psychoanalysis. I think the title ""a dangerous method"" ultimately has numerous interpretations, but it could simply mean that at the birth of psychoanalysis. If this is the case, I would have love to see more of the dangers of it. They mention a few scenes of people being against the practice, but for the most part, it seems like it's been taking pretty well. The experiment aspect of it, its newness, and its missteps were all dangerous especially because they were dealing with the personalities, minds, and lives of people. The only danger was that of Sabina Spielrein, and as I would state, she wasn't that dangerous indeed as well. The movie does give props to Spielrein recognition for contributions to analytic theory, but gives fresh perspective on the Freud-Jung stalemate that resulted in the two parting ways. I think this movie would probably need prior knowledge of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud to get some of the messages, it's putting out. It does explain a few of them, but for some parts, it doesn't. It can be a bit confusing dialogues. Most of the jokes that Sigmund Freud use can go over the head of some of the audience watching. Such in the case of the joke about 'the plague', a joke about the different thinking between European minds and that of Americans. The movie loves to put out interesting information just put out there, with no development. This is the problem with this movie, no depth. It's quite flat, not very subtle. Is it historic accurate, at less? It's hard to tell, the sex scenes for an example, there is no evidence that the two Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein indulged in spanking or whipping. It was just use for a perverted sense of reality. By showing sexual perversion in the film, it does dig into the mind of what Sabina had the time. Sabina was indeed sexual fixations on being beaten by her father, thus she sees Carl Jung as a father like figure. The movie forget her perversion sense of defecation. I know it might sound gross, but if you going to show shocking imaging to the audience with scenes of spanking, then you might want to show scenes of defecation as that would be more historic accurate. The film tries to put a sense of 'thriller' in it by making Sabina into a psychopath, dead set on either getting the hapless Jung back or ruining him, but even with that, it doesn't seem as dangerous as the title present it to be. Sabina doesn't have the off the wagon mindset to do such things. It a disappointment, because the film been market that way. Liked this film, but bothered me in terms of history. Jung is painted as man who didn't love his family and sneaks around behind his wife's back when, in fact, he actually brought Toni to his house, claimed her his second wife straight to Emma, whose seen as this housewife baby-making-machine and nothing more when, in fact, she too was a psychoanalyist and Jung loved her very much. Not only did he call her the foundation of his home, as seen in the film, but said she was a queen when she died. Both Fassbender and Mortensen in my opinion make for convincing shrinks. Michael Fassbender is one of my favorite actors, so I know without a doubt, that guy is going places. He is chameleon talent. The scenes with both are crafty, and thoroughly enjoyable. Kiera Knightley's crazy antics acting might be a little bit overacting. The Russian accent was pretty bad. I don't know about the Jaw work. Overall: the movie is unsatisfying. I got deeply confused, and I think of myself as a very smart man. I was confused by the locations. At one minute, we were in Austria, the next in Switzerland and the next in Sweden. It got confusing as we jump back and forth further time. I felt like the movie just didn't really go all the way. Last Kiera Knightley's performance just ruined it for me. I do like the music score. I do like Viggo and Michael Fassbender's performance, but in the long run, this movie will probably sit on the shelf. I can only see fans of both David Cronenberg and people interested in psychoanalysis, watching it. As a film about psychoanalysis, it does little to explain it. As a movie meant to entertain, it did little of that too. In the end, this movie seem more like just a Freudian slip.",A Dangerous Method
31,Dr_Coulardeau,Too bad it does not go beyond 1914,8,23 January 2012,"This film is not in Cronenberg's most common style but it is well done. It is nicely quaint and that is definitely the British touch in it, quaint to the point of nostalgia, mind you before the Fist World War in Austria and in Switzerland.But The film is divided between the sentimental conflict and impulses, that are also sexual, and the more serious subjects of the relation between Jews and Aryans in the German speaking Europe of the time on one hand and the theoretical and practical debate between Freud and Jung on the other hand. That gives to the film a strange equilibrium that definitely makes the sexual and sentimental side purely animalistic and the theoretical part a purely boring discussion between essentially males locked up in their impulses, repressions and other axioms.The sentimental side is simple. Carl Jung had liaisons, a little bit more than affairs with his own patients and played on the term by refusing their fees when he started the liaison or affair. At the same time he keeps a rather serene relation with his own wife who is extremely well-off. That sounds sordid and that is anyway a case of abuse of power from a person in an authority position to a person in a medically dependent position. That is unacceptable from any point of view. That side of the film is off-limits.The second question, that of the relations between Jews and Aryans before 1914 in German speaking countries is only expressed by Freud and is a total rejection of some compromise with the Aryans and an advice to the young student Jung had a liaison with to remember that Jews are not supposed to mix with Aryans and are supposed to keep together. This cast a bright light on the reasons of the ending of the relation of Jung and Freud, though it is true in a way Freud was too intellectually powerful for Jung to remain under his influence too long. The question at stake here is the fact that Jung considers that Freud brings too much sexuality in psychoanalysis.The third question is the continuation of the previous one. The debate between Freud and Jung before 1914. Can the whole psychology of a human being be reduced to his libido, hence to his sexual instinct or impulse? Jung starts thinking then that many other elements interfere with the psychology of an individual that come from the social and cultural field, both being time-sensitive and hence inherited from the past, from history, and hence the reflection of this history, including ancient history. Jung will go very far in that direction after WW1. A side issue is brought into the picture by Sabina Spielrein, the student and patient Jung had a liaison with. She seems to tend to think that a love relation, a sexual relation leads to the destruction of both egos in order to be able to produce a new one. This is by far the reduction of the sexual and sentimental impulse, the libido, to only one objective: procreation. This is dangerous.The point is that Wilhelm Reich is missing in that picture who will defend the idea that the libido aims mainly at getting pleasure and that procreation is only kind of a side effect, which it has become nowadays due to contraceptives and other birth control means.That reduces the debate to the arguments that will triumph in Scientology: the only basic and central aim of all life is the survival instinct, at the level of the individual, intercourse, the immediate group and the species. If sexuality has only one aim, procreation, if pleasure can only be taken into account outside procreation, hence outside a marital relation, if the only aim of the individual is to survive in a way or another, humanity is reduced to a herd of animals that have to be manipulated and brainwashed by the few powerful ones who will dominate by self appointment due to their force, no matter what.I thus regret this film does not step over 14-18 and does not envisage the later period of the 1920s and the 1930s, when things became quite different and a lot more interesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",A Dangerous Method
32,leplatypus,"For one time, Freud was right (web)",10,11 February 2017,"Personnaly, i'm rather Jungian than Freudian because Jung dazzles me with his collective unconscious, mythical knowledge while Freud links all problems to sex. This enlarged scope versus this limited scope is indeed talked in the movie. So far i didn't know that the two worked together and their meting was really interesting to follow. So it was rather a disappointment to learn that their break-up was due essentially about a woman whom Jungs likes to whip ass! It's not the first time (and surely not the last) when a great mind fails stature and private life reveals a much darker person. Anyway this movie has an incredible fantastic four cast: Fassbender is always this deep inside treacherous man, Mortensen shows his natural authority and his ability with cigars, Cassel, despite his beard, looks very much like his late father and his french appetite is true and for sure, Keira has one of her best part ever: always sweet with past fashion, she shows one more time her determination as well her inner weakness as she punches herself into madness! Cronenberg is inspired with his camera and offers us one of his best movies since a lot of years!

33,Vartiainen,From and within dreams we live,7,30 January 2017,"A biographical drama movie about Dr. Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, Professor Sigmund Freud, founder of psychoanalysis, and Sabina Spielrein, a patient of Jung and eventually one of the first female psychoanalysts. It starts when Spielrein arrives to the become of Jung's patients and follows their lives from thereon out.Like a good biographical dram should, this movie taught me quite a lot about the subject matter. Naturally, as a movie under two hours, it takes certain liberties with the source material, but the essentials are still there and they're there to spark your interest. I've gone to Wikipedia after many of these movies to learn more. Likewise in this case. For example, I was quite aware who Freud and Jung were and I was familiar with the gist of their theories and studies. I was even aware that Jung was considered to be something of a successor to Freud's work. But I had never quite realized that they had been peers in the same field living at the same time. Jung is younger, certainly, but they had frequent correspondence and regarded each other as equals. Or at least very close to equals. I also had never realized that Freud's Jewish origins painted his discipline in a certain light in those early days of the 20th century.Though, to be fair, the movie has some flaws. The acting is for the most part great. Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud is especially inspired casting and his tired musings are some of the best content the film has to offer. Keira Knightley as Sabina Spielrein is the one that's going to divide opinions. Her later scenes are for the most part fine, but some of her early scenes, when she's still suffering from severe hysteria, are almost laughably over the top. She juts her jaw out like a cavewoman, speaks with odd pauses and behaves quite like the stereotypical cartoon mental patient. It's of course possible that the real Spielrein had such symptoms, but I doubt it.The movie also suffers from the bane of biographical movies, which is to say that the story doesn't have enough cohesion. The initial setup in certainly interesting, as are the characters, but the film falters towards the end because there's really no great place to stop. There are still things in the future worth mentioning, but the overall themes and ideas have already been exhausted, yet the characters continue to live their lives. Like real people do. Very few biographical movies can escape this trap, and I don't blame this movie for being unable to do so, but it's still something of a problem.Still, definitely a film worth watching for the fans of the genre.",A Dangerous Method
34,Turfseer,"True believers in Freud and Jung's iconic status, will dig this; others perhaps not as much",6,25 October 2012,"'A Dangerous Method' is advertised as a film mainly dramatizing the conflict between iconic therapists Carl Jung and his one-time mentor, Sigmund Freud. But the bulk of the film is really about an affair that Jung had with one of his patients, Sabina Spielrein, who later went on to become a prominent Russian physician and psychoanalyst.The film begins in 1904 with Spielrein, a young medical student, checking into a psychiatric clinic with severe symptoms of what was termed 'hysteria' in those days. She primarily displays a complex motor tic of continuously thrusting her jaw out and stuttering and often must be restrained by the staff at the clinic. Carl Jung, a student of Sigmund Freud, employs Freud's new 'talking therapy' with Spielrein, who makes remarkable progress and is soon offered a job by Jung, to assist him in his medical research (Spielrein's transformation from borderline psychotic to responsible student is too abrupt as we never see how Jung actually works his miracle--Jung returns from military leave and we must take it on faith that somehow, through the passage of time, his therapy simply worked!)Jung is married to a wealthy woman who he has a number of children with. During the course of his relationship with Spielrein, he treats a disaffected physician, Otto Gross, who urges him to abandon his monogamous ways and pursue his sexual desires with Sabina. It is the contention of the film's scenarists that Jung indeed began an affair with Spielrein; her illness was related to being physically punished by her father in childhood and she now sublimates these negative experiences by engaging in masochistic spanking and bondage sessions with Jung (coupled with normal sexual encounters).Meanwhile, Jung corresponds with Freud and meets with him a number of times, including a trip to America. Freud is depicted as a rigid theoretician and practitioner, inflexibly adhering to his core belief that mental illness is rooted only in childhood sexual experiences. Jung eventually seeks to incorporate other theories to explain psychological dysfunction which Freud derides, and ultimately rejects, as 'mysticism'.The dissolution of Jung and Freud's relationship is tied to Jung's dissolving relationship with Spielrein. He not only publishes studies about his treatment of her but her dissertation as well. They both agree that acts of creation can be rooted in destruction (holding up their own relationship as a perfect example: a clash of opposites and breaking of taboos), not necessarily related to Freud's one note obsession with childhood sexuality. Although Spielrein is essentially on Jung's side, she decides to undergo analysis with Freud who she hopes might play mediator between the warring couple, after Jung (due to guilt feelings) breaks things off between them. While Spielrein takes the high road by not exposing Jung, she insists he confess his indiscretions to Freud. After agreeing to Spielrein's request, Freud uses Jung's confession against him, bashing Jung in future correspondence, after his former pupil fails to pay homage to him. After they split, both Freud and Jung then fail to acknowledge Speilrein's contributions. She finally gets over Jung, becomes a notable analyst in her own right and has children with a kindly physician from her native Russia.The resolution of both of these plot strands (Jung and Freud and Jung and Spielrein), will prove of great interest to aficionados of the great psychotherapeutic icons, but to the general public, perhaps much more anti-climactic. If we are to believe the scenarists here, Jung went way beyond his mentor Freud, in terms of presenting much broader, holistic, psychological constructs. Much of this we learn in the closing titles at film's end but I'm not convinced that Jung is the better of the two.To their credit, Freud is depicted as a minority practitioner, beleaguered on many sides, due to his unpopular emphasis on sexuality. He argued that Jung's belief in 'superstition' undermined the 'scientific' basis of their profession. Ultimately, a one hour and forty five minute film, can only touch upon the basic conflicting points between the two men. For a deeper understanding between Freud and Jung, a real solution is to read through their writings. Creative luminaries such as Joyce Joyce, however, did not care to--he dubbed them both ""Tweedledum and Tweedledee"" (perhaps if both of them had written a novel as good as 'Ulysses', they may have earned Joyce's approbation).Michael Fassbender as Jung is perhaps the strongest of the three principals. He displays a subdued intensity throughout the film. Many internet posters found Keira Knightley as Spielrein to be way over the top, particularly in the early scenes where she is depicted as being completely unhinged. I didn't think she was that bad at all and is perhaps the strongest when she makes her case for Jung, while meeting up with Freud. Viggo Mortensen comes off as a bit boring as Freud but is perhaps saddled by the rather ponderous, dialogue heavy script.'A Dangerous Method' will keep your interest up to a point. Ultimately, however, Freud and Jung's work may not be worth immortalizing in any film at all. There is a deeper and darker tale here, far more ominous and important than the conflict between seemingly self-involved intellectuals. I'm referring to the fate of Sabina Spielrein, revealed in the closing credits. She was murdered along with her two children by Einsatzgruppe D, one of the Nazi death squads, near her home town in Russia, in August of 1942. The machinations of Freud and Jung seem like a distant memory in light of the evil which inexorably began its march over the European continent some 100 years ago, almost to this day.",A Dangerous Method
35,BeneCumb,"Too arid, even for a film about men of science",7,9 January 2014,"I was prepared to expect that a film about Jung and Freud would contain lots of sophisticated talks and terms (well, I have studied philosophy myself), but sometimes they outshine other important topics and make the course of events too static. However, thanks to great performances, particularly Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, Michael Fassbender as Carl Jung, Keira Knightley as Sabina Spielrein, Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross; I would point out Mortensen's role that was so different from the ones we have used to see. The film contains lots of wise dialogues, there are a few occasions only when discussions are held by 3 or more participants, and watching facial impressions provides additional value. So does the depiction of real places, persons and ideas - the decades before the World War I were among the finest in European history regarding developments in various fields of activities, not yet destroyed by wars and revolutions...All in all, A Dangerous Method is dynamic in comparison with e.g. Waiting for Godot, but be prepared - the pace is slow and language is complex.",A Dangerous Method
36,dee.reid,"A ""Method"" to the madness...",7,12 April 2016,"A number of reviewers and critics have already stated that the 2011 historical drama ""A Dangerous Method"" - about the birth of psychoanalysis in the beginning of the 20th century - was a film long in the making by its director, Canadian ""body horror"" master David Cronenberg.Reviewers and critics have noted that ""A Dangerous Method"" is admirably restrained - meaning there's no gratuitous sex or extreme violence (common characteristics of much of Cronenberg's past work up until this point). But sex does come up here a lot, though it's mostly through carefully written stretches of dialogue meant to explain the dynamics of human behavior and the human mind. In other words, it's the ideas that mean the most here, rather than their physical signifiers (though there is also some of that here, too).The film details the professional relationship and personal friendship of Swiss neurologist Sigmund Freud (Cronenberg's go-to veteran, Viggo Mortensen) and a young psychiatrist at the beginning of his career named Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). Opening in 1904 only a few years before the outbreak of World War I, ""A Dangerous Method"" begins with the arrival of a young Russian woman named Sabina Speilrein (Keira Knightley) to a mental hospital in Zurich, where she becomes Jung's patient. (Suffering from hysterics and repressed sexual desire, Knightley's performance may grate some viewers, but it's one of the more truer depictions of mental illness. Her showy theatrics pretty much dominate the film's first half-hour before she settles down into relative coherence.)Jung begins his care of her simply by talking to her, in applying a newly founded psychoanalytical technique derived from Freud. Jung begins a correspondence with Freud in Vienna, and when the two meet for the first time they have a conversation that will last a whopping 13 hours. At this same time, Jung begins an extramarital affair with Sabina, who eventually recovers from her condition, and studies to become a psychologist herself after assisting Jung for a time in his work. (Jung is also challenged by the arrival of a neurotic young doctor who becomes a patient - Otto Gross, played by Vincent Cassel - who believes that sexual repression is dangerous for the individual and society as a whole; Jung obviously believes in the reverse.) Eventually, though, Sabina and the competing psychological theories of Freud and Jung drive both men apart.""A Dangerous Method"" was written by Christopher Hampton, which is adapted from his own stage play ""The Talking Cure,"" as well as the 1993 non-fiction book ""A Most Dangerous Method"" by John Kerr. The film has been described as an ""intellectual menage-a-trois"" by some critics and indeed in the hands of Cronenberg, it is. The film is at its most engaging when the three characters challenge one another with their theories and observations of psychoanalysis. You may not be able to keep up with it all - especially if you're not familiar with the practice of psychology - but it does make for a compelling viewing experience in that regard.""A Dangerous Method"" is David Cronenberg's most transgressive movie yet - after the increasingly mainstream crime-thrillers ""A History of Violence"" (2005) and ""Eastern Promises"" (2007), both of which starred Viggo Mortensen. It's a movie about ideas, extremely subtle and restrained, yet deliberate. It is yet another solid entry in David Cronenberg's auteur style.7/10",A Dangerous Method
37,meeza,The best movie of 2011! Psyched!!! Not really!,7,26 December 2012,"I will insert a very pun-filled dangerous method in my review of ""A Dangerous Method"", which deals with the relationship of famed psychoanalysis gurus Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and the woman who came between them; sort of speak. I will try to limit the amount of Freudian slips in this review because it just might be a pun Jungle in here. Anyways, the film's mindset is on Jung's keen interest on a troubled female Russian patient named Sabina Spielrein, who ended up being Jung's mistress lover so there was plenty of action of Sabina under the ""sabana"" for Jung. Under the so-called ""not so tender"" care of Jung, Spielrein enjoyed being sexually punished by Jung with a little slap on the buttocks here and there; and there are no ""ands"" ""ifs"" or ""buts"" in that statement, well maybe a few butts- Red Ones. Ironically enough, Spielrein ended up being one of the first female psychoanalysts; so she was not a total pain in the ass. Then there is the relationship between Jung and good old Freud; which definitely had its id, ego, and superego qualities to it. Freud expected for Jung to carry on his sexual psychoanalytical interpretations in his field of study, but Jung was not up for the task by having his own opposing viewpoints and thought Freud over-analyzed the sexual paradigm. Director David Cronenberg formulated a decent cinematic hypothesis in his construction of ""A Dangerous Method"", but somehow I did not lust for this movie. There was something missing. A stronger emphasis on the sexual ideals of Freud might have given this movie a rise; yes, for the record that was a prototype ""Freudian Slip"". Christopher Hampton's psychobabble screenplay lacked a bit of character development, even though he verbally nailed the Jung & Spielrein relationship scenes. Michael Fassbender should have no shame in his starring work as Jung. Keira Knightley was decent as Spielrein even though she did suffer from a bit of ""over-the-top"" acting in a few parts of the flick; and I am not referring to her positioning during the Jung and Spielrein sexual scenes. What psyched me up the most about this movie was the riveting performance of Viggo Mortensen as Freud. Mortensen's transformation of Sigmund is what acting dreams are made of. ""A Dangerous Method"" is not the movie it could have been, but I do give it a marginal recommendation for it to reach your conscious or subconscious state of mind. **** Average",A Dangerous Method
38,MaxBorg89,Method and Madness,7,27 November 2011,"Given his entire filmography is concerned with themes linked to man's identity and the complexities of human sexuality, David Cronenberg is, on paper at least, the ideal director for A Dangerous Method, a movie dealing with the birth of psychoanalysis. Then again, the film is also a bit of an odd fit for him, since the script by Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons) doesn't really lend itself to the outbursts of graphic violence that permeate the Canadian auteur's body of work. The result, first witnessed at the Venice Film Festival (after the film had allegedly been rejected by Cronenberg's fest of choice, Cannes), is an interesting but somewhat hollow entry in the director's admirable career.Ostensibly about the professional relationship between Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender), A Dangerous Method is in reality more concerned with the bond between Jung and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a young woman sent to his clinic in Zurich since her mental condition is an ideal subject for his research. Sabina, it turns out, is incredibly well-read, and soon progresses from patient to assistant, much to the amusement of Freud, who corresponds regularly with Jung about their mutual scientific interests and also meets the young woman on a few occasions. The relationship between the three evolves in even stranger ways as time passes, with Sabina taking an unexpected place in Jung's heart...With its combination of psychoanalysis and sex, the story - perhaps familiar to European film buffs thanks to Roberto Faenza's Italian-language take on the same subject - has all the right characteristics to be vintage Cronenberg (hints of which are offered in the opening and closing credits via Howard Shore's music). And yet there's something missing: whereas the reconstruction of Vienna in the early 20th century is impeccable, the director appears to be less interested in the actual development of story and character, with a rather detached approach that suggests he's almost working on autopilot. That having said, part of the blame can be laid on Hampton, whose screenplay only glosses over key details of the story, leaving us with a quite simplified, ""safe"" version of events (the sex is unusually tame and unchallenging for a Cronenberg film).The performances are a mixed bag as well: Knightley, stuck with the showy role, is unbearably OTT in the first 30 minutes, shouting and shaking endlessly before she eventually tones down the mania and focuses on finding the character, complete with a solid Russian accent. At the other end of the spectrum is Mortensen, pitch-perfect from the start but criminally underused, especially considering his past associations with Cronenberg. And then there's Fassbender, quietly intense and generally up to the task, were it not for his decision to speak RP English when he and Mortensen, who adopts a German accent, are supposed to be from the same country (this is even more perplexing if one thinks of Fassbender's flawless mastery of German).A Dangerous Method is thus a textbook case of a film that, while not disappointing in the strict sense of the word, comes off as a minor effort in a generally spotless filmography. But even on an off-day, Cronenberg deserves to be seen at least once. Just don't expect another History of Violence...6,5/10",A Dangerous Method
39,estebangonzalez10,Not what I was expecting,5,29 February 2012,"¨Experiences like this, however painful, unnecessary and inevitable, without them, how can we know life? ¨ David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method was one of my most anticipated films of 2011 for several reasons: First of all I loved Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's first two collaborations together in A History of Violence and Eastern Promises. Those two films were among my favorite when they were released. Mortensen has always worked really well with Cronenberg and I had high expectations for his role as Sigmund Freud in this film. Add Micheal Fassbender, who has turned everything he touches into gold this year; to the mix and you have yourself one of the most anticipated films of the year. I was really looking forward to what these three men could do together alongside the beautiful Keira Knightley. I'm not familiar with psychoanalysis, but I do tend to enjoy the subject matter somewhat so I was really looking forward to this movie. Perhaps those high expectations were my downfall because this was a completely different movie from the previous two that Cronenberg had directed. This was more focused on the dialogue and relationship between the characters. This isn't an action film with shocking scenes; it is more of a reflective film that analyzes the relationship between Freud, Jung, and Spielrein. I just felt the pace of the movie was too slow and that there wasn't enough time between the transitions to further develop each character and their relationship together. I felt like I had seen an incomplete film, or that several scenes were missing. The film focuses more on the relationship between Jung and his Russian patient Spielrein, and not so much on Freud, so that was something else I wish would've been different.The film is based on John Kerr's book of the same name, and from Hampton's play ¨The Talking Cure.¨ Hampton himself adapted the screenplay for this movie. The story takes place during the early 1900's in Europe. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is a psychiatrist and firm believer in Freud's recent theories. When a young Russian patient named Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) is sent to him at his office in Switzerland, he finds the opportunity to apply Freud's methods on her. Jung has amazing results and ends up helping Spielrein and bringing her back to normal society life. Spielrein suffered from some sort of dementia, but thanks to Jung she is able to return to her medical studies. Despite her rehabilitation, Jung continues to treat her, and he writes to Freud (Viggo Mortensen) telling him about his amazing results. Jung is invited to Vienna by Freud and together they have an interesting thirteen hour conversation about their discoveries and theories. They begin an interesting friendship and write to each other over the years about their new findings. They do have their discrepancies in some areas since Freud only is willing to point out the problem, but Jung wants to go further and try to help the patients recover and not just single out their problems. The movie also focuses on Jung's relationship with Spielrein as she becomes his lover presenting him with an internal conflict since she is his patient, and there is also the fact that he is married to Emma (Sarah Gadon).The main problem I had with this movie was the pacing the film had. Despite being only 100 minutes long, the movie does feel much longer and it seems to be missing something. I felt like I was seeing an incomplete picture. After a while the dialogues and conversations got boring, despite the fact that the performances were all incredible. Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen are both terrific actors and they shone in the scenes in which they were together, but the problem was that they didn't share too much screen time together. They spent most of the time corresponding through letters. The main protagonists were Fassbender and Knightley and unfortunately her character wasn't very fascinating. She did give a good performance, but I just felt at first her dementia was really distracting and exaggerated. It was weird to see her rehabilitated so quickly. I wanted to see more of Viggo Mortensen and less of the others. Vincent Cassel had a small but great supporting role and it was he who mostly influenced Jung into wanting to have an affair with his patient. My expectations were set way to high for this movie and by the end I was disappointed. I hope Mortensen and Cronenberg return to their previous work and continue to collaborate together in a similar project. One that will be more climactic than this film which at moments felt like nothing really interesting was happening.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",A Dangerous Method
40,3xHCCH,Very Boring,3,17 January 2012,"I would like to think that I appreciate the art of movies, despite the preponderance of dialog and the lack of exciting action. However, I have to say that ""A Dangerous Method"" is really one of the most pretentious and boring films I have ever seen. Despite that the running time was just about 90 minutes, it seemed to just go on and on interminably. And worse, there seemed to be no reward for the viewers who stayed put and watched patiently to the end.""A Dangerous Method"" is about the history of how psychoanalysis began as a therapeutic technique for psychologically-disturbed patients. Psychologist Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) gets sexually involved with one of his hysterical patients Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) as he tries to get into the roots of her hysteria. Since sex is involved, Jung's contemporary Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) also gets into the scene. Unfortunately the execution of the script by Christopher Hampton is as tedious as a psychoanalysis session. Even the sex scenes were devoid of passion and boring.You will not feel any compassion for any of these unlikable characters! Fassbender lacked charisma in the central role of Jung whom he underplays. On the other end, Knightley overacts severely in the first half of the film and continues to be irritating throughout the film. Mortensen was cast in a most unexpected role, which was okay in the most part he was on screen, but was very underwritten. Mortensen's past two collaborations with director David Cronenberg -- ""History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises"" -- were infinitely more satisfying than this tedious wordy lecture. This was definitely not one of Cronenberg's best.",A Dangerous Method
41,dierregi,"Why the ""talking cure"" can be dangerous",6,15 January 2012,"I read some disappointed reviews about this movie, based on wrong expectations, so perhaps it is better to clarify immediately what this movie is not. It is not a short story of psychoanalysis, nor is the story of the Freud/Jung relationship. The screenplay is based on a stage play titled ""The Talking Cure"" and plot revolves around the first time this ""cure"" was experiment – allegedly by Jung, with Ms. Spielrein as his patient.So the movie could perhaps be described as ""the beginning of psychoanalysis with patient n. 1"".The relation between Jung (played by Fassbender) and Freud (played by Mortensen) is on the background, but the public may gather quite a lot about the complexities of the human mind (even the mind of geniuses), following the deterioration of their professional bond. Freud might have been jealous of Jung financial possibilities. Jung might have been annoyed by the father-son relationship and looking for more independence The main character on the movie is undoubtedly Ms. Sabina Spielrein, portrayed by Keira Knightley. Knightley received lots of negative reviews, but I think she did quite a good job with what was an extremely difficult part.The film opens with Sabina in full hysteric mood. Since hysteria is an illness of the past, it was understandably difficult for Knightley to decide how to play it. Many criticized her for going over the top with the grimaces and I also found it quite disturbing, but I wonder if there is a way to play ""a quiet hysterical"", when hysteria is by definition an ""unmanageable emotional excess"".However, thanks to the ""cure"" Sabina gets under control quite quickly, and reverts to her former love for medicine, deciding to remain in Switzerland to pursue her academic career. However, during the course of her therapy she revealed quite a lot about her sexual preferences to Doctor Jung, who after some hesitation appears ready to exploit his knowledge.This part about the unethical behavior of Jung was the most disturbing, but also revealing why the ""talking cure"" can turn into a ""dangerous method"". Therefore, the film delivers exactly what it promises, and I found it well made and rather interesting.",A Dangerous Method
42,jadepietro,Cronenberg's Freudian Slip-up,4,31 January 2012,"This film is not recommended.  As the saying goes, ""There is a method to his madness."" And in David  Cronenberg's latest film about the beginnings of psychoanalysis, A  Dangerous Method, the reverse can also be said. Yes, there is a madness  to his method. The ""enfant terrible"" of filmmaking delves into the  relationship of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung while adding a decisively  clinical remoteness to the kinky and violent dare-doings of the latter  whose form of treating a patient includes sexual intercourse and  personal pleasure.  The film begins in 1904. Jung ( Michael Fassbender ) encounters a newly  acquired mental patient named Sabina Spielrein ( Keira Knightley ) who  suffers from sudden bouts of hysteria. He begins treatment only to find  a strange attraction to her. Jung brings his medical findings to his  father figure, Sigmund Freud ( Viggo Mortensen ), a mentor and  colleague whom he reveres. This leads him to another doctor and  patient, Otto Gross ( Vincent Cassel ), a devil's advocate of sorts,  with an emphasis on the devil. Soon patient becomes sexual partner and  doctor needs treatment.  The director has always enjoyed creating damaged and deranged  characters into his repertoire. He also relishes the uneasiness he  unleashes with his films: the blood-spattered death match in Eastern  Promises, all of the sudden violent acts in A History of Violence, the  unending gore ratio in The Fly, the leather-clad carnal auto-erotic  acts in Crash. Making his audience squirm is part of his nature as a  filmmaker (along with the other David as in Lynch ) and he continues  his obsession to disturb his audience with scenes of over-the-top  madness of a sexual nature. However, most of the squirming in the  audience this time was from the sluggish pacing and excessive  philosophical discussions that drone on and on. His usual flair of edgy  ""dangerous"" diversions in filmmaking remain as stunted as his stiff  collared gentlemen. The sexual scenes of humiliation and beatings would  barely earn the S&M Seal of Approval. Cronenberg's trademark shock  value dynamics are nowhere to be seen. His new obsession is now with  the spoken word, making this gabfest just a stifling intellectual bore.  In fact, for a film that is all about obsession ( Freud's insistence of  our sex drive stemming from our deep-seeded emotional disorders, Jung's  ethical violation of his patient and his interest in spirituality,  Sabina's insatiable sexual desires and hedonist life choices, etc. ), A  Dangerous Method rarely registers a pulse. The patient is dead on  arrival!  Cronenberg still has the visual eye for details in his early 20th  century Vienna setting. The film conveys that sumptuous era in its fine  art direction and period costumes. He also casts two of his three  actors ideally for their roles: Fassbender brings a polished reserve to  his troubled and pampered therapist and Mortensen delivers a fully  nuanced portrayal of the wise and cautious father of psychoanalysis.  Both actors contribute greatly to the dull and fatigue- inducing  screenplay by Christopher Hampton, based on his play, The Talking Cure,  of which there seems to be none.  In the pivotal role of the tragic Sabina, a miscast and misdirected Ms.  Knightly is victimized both on and off screen. Her performance is so  glaringly exaggerated and fearlessly full blown that it seriously  undercuts any notion of realism or sympathy to her character. She  becomes a ill-defined caricature. Her face distorts, her cheeks hollow,  her jaw struts unnaturally forward, her once lovely profile becomes  horselike and angular, as if she is channeling Mr. Ed into her frail  body in search of a bag of oats to gnarl away on. It quite a showy  performance, but not in a good way. ( This is, by far, the worst  performance that this gifted actress has ever done, and let's not even  mention her noticeably wavering Russian accent, making her character in  more urgent need of an acting and dialect coach than an psychologist. )  Poor Ms. Knightly relied on her director as her muse and he betrayed  her trust. )  A Dangerous Method is a film that betrays our trust too. We expect to  see a frank and explicit exposé into sexual repression and carnal  needs, especially from its renown director's film legacy. Instead we  get wardrobe malfunctions of slightly exposed nipples, some spankings,  and passionless lovemaking. The film remains aloof, unemotional, and  far too clinical. It takes itself so seriously and becomes insufferably  smug.   Let us hope that Cronenberg's cinematic exercise into respectability is  highly treatable and, in the future, moviegoers will once again be  treated to the director's more edgy and distinctive style, a dangerous  method of filmmaking we have come to know from this unique and talented  artist, rather than slog through the silly and lifeless psychobabble of  films like A Dangerous Method.

43,Amyth47,Not the best work of Cronenberg.,4,26 May 2020,"My Rating : 4/10The master of body horror unfortunately fails to deliver with 'A Dangerous Method' - a sort of generic and shallow romance drama with a superficial gaze at psychoanalysis.The characters are not developed, they seem to just interact in this boring love affair in a very superficial kind of way. The few moments of the movie where you can see Freud and Jung discussing psychology (talking about the libido, about Junguian concepts, etc) are left unexplained and feel totally out of place because the movie is not about that, it's just about the love affair between this man and this woman.It's a mess. Now, about Keira Knightley, I think she's fantastic, but in this movie her performance was overacted and forced, you can tell at some points of the story she doesn't know whether to act crazy or normal. I think the actors were just as lost as I was, they didn't know what to do because the characters were not defined at all.

44,p-stepien,A triangle of psychosis,7,27 August 2012,"At the beginning of the 20th Century modern-day psychoanalysis was coming to the forefront mainly through the work of penis-obsessed Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and the more individualistic teachings of Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender). Caught up in the battle for primacy of science is neurotic sex-obsessed Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), who as a patient / understudy to Carl Jung develops a deep relation with her mentor, which transcends into erotic extremities. As interactions between the elder scientist Freud and his youthful protégée Jung are enhanced, they finally end with a dramatic split of chosen paths, where Jung decides to foregoe any previous admiration towards his peer. Through emotional undercurrents of relations between the three characters we are introduced to tidbits of history of psychoanalysis and the differences in vision of the men who revolutionised the world. Events are strongly based on real life incidents, mostly historically accurate with only a necessary dramatic licence put in place to forward the story.Thematically a very Cronenberg film and a mildly successful endeavor, which invites re-watching to fully understand the interactions between all three main characters and their undeniable, but only subtly presented, consequences. Cronenberg, always a master at getting the ugliness as well as the acting out of the most incompetent manages a rare feat: successfully proves that Keira Knightley does have some acting credentials, even if her crazed performance full of nervous ticks was at times unbearable to watch. Nothing as accomplished as the opposing forces of Mortensen and Fassbender who masterfully confronted each other both as actors as well as characters. In a tale of rivalry between concepts and ideals personal animosities do not go unnoticed with an absolutely key scene, where Jung reveals intimate dreams to Freud, who in turn reacts with contempt at Jung's readiness to be dissected, pointing out strongly that he would never lower himself to such a level.""A Dangerous Method"" is also as emotionally sterile and disturbing as Cronenberg can be (despite having almost no brutality and little sexual content).

I know, besides, the discussions that psychoanalysis and psychology have been facing throughout the years, but I'm not taking any side. I just happen to enjoy analysis and that's all. This movie involved me from the get go, mainly due to the consistent acting from Keira Knightley, whose performance has really stolen the show. I just didn't enjoy it more because Freud's life wasn't as explored as I thought it would be-- and as I HOPED it'd. However, it feels indeed interesting to understand the issues that such science has faced until it got to the point it's in now: as the questioner of the mind. Moreover, the brilliance of ""A Dangerous Method"" gets visible when it exposes that psychoanalysis isn't going to save the world like a Messias, but that it's going to try to understand life, just as it is: good, tough, difficult and filled with neverending questions.

While at first, the two heir doctors Freud and Jung, are intrigued and delighted by each others insights things become complicated when Jung and his patient Sabina begin a torrid love affair.It is clear from the get-go that the cordial relationship between the two doctors won't last long. Whether it is for academic, social or religious differences is open to interpretation. In fact a lot of this film is open to interpretation which becomes a bit of a handicap. Freud seems worried his work will be discredited due to growing anti-Semitism yet no conflict is brewed to make this evident. Freud urges his colleague not to dedicate time to tangential areas like alchemy, religion and mysticism yet Jung seems to never really pursuit such ideas, at least not on screen. So in place of conflict we are left with snippets of intellectual discussions and a bawdy love affair that is not entirely convincing.Don't get me wrong, Fassbinder and Knightley work wonders with a mediocre script but what should be a sensuous slow boil is actually near clinical story plotting with little to make either character likable or their affections understandable. This in turn makes Jung's decisions to break the rules of doctor patient relations not to mention his own definitions of morality all the more frustrating to watch.How can someone take psychoanalysis seriously when its two most famous proponents are portrayed, A: as a self-aggrandizing, dogmatic, political pragmatist or B: a naïve, hypocritical neophyte? Perhaps that's the point. 200,000 of introspection has got us nowhere to understanding who we really are and Freud's 'dangerous method' is yet another shot in the dark. In one scene Sabina's character exposes the irony that Jung ""cured"" her using Freud's methods. Yet a few scenes earlier, Freud himself says ""curing"" someone is impossible. Perhaps all three need another trip to the sanatorium.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",A Dangerous Method
48,moviexclusive,"As intellectually stimulating as a portrayal of psychoanalysis and its founders should be, this is cerebral entertainment not for the common viewer",7,28 January 2012,"The 'dangerous method' the title of this unusual David Cronenberg film  refers to is psychoanalysis, pioneered by two of the founding fathers  of modern-day psychology Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. It was also more  commonly known as the ""talking cure"", since as a form of treatment it  involved the psychiatrist inferring the cause of the patient's  psychosis from the latter's descriptions of his or her fantasies and  dreams. As adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play (which in turn  was based on John Kerr's esteemed 1994 book 'A Most Dangerous Method'),  the film is not only about the birth of psychoanalysis but also the  complex relationship between Freud, Jung and their female counterpart  Sabina Spielrein.  Those familiar with Freudian theory may come to expect a sexually  charged depiction of the trio's relationship, but instead of relying on  theatrics, Cronenberg has admirably chosen to take an intellectual  approach with the material. This means that like its subject, there is  a lot of talking going on in the form of conversations, treatment  sessions and letters, a deliberate technique which Cronenberg uses to  force his viewer to pay attention to his characters and their  interactions. It also means however that viewers more accustomed to his  brand of unrestrained violence in 'A History of Violence' and 'Eastern  Promises' will likely find themselves frustrated, since this is  probably one of his most restrained works ever.  Hampton's narrative unfolds through a series of episodes spanning from  1904 to the eve of World War I, beginning with the arrival of Sabina as  a young Russian Jewish woman at Jung's Burgholzli Clinic in Zurich.  Sabina begins as Jung's patient, brought writhing and howling before  the calm, collected and deeply analytical doctor. Using the  psychoanalytical method developed by Freud, Jung attributes her  hysteria to her humiliation bred from constant beatings by her father  as a child and her sexual urges to her repression of these traumatic  memories. Such is the nature of Freudian theory, which of course has  been criticised by later psychologists as well as Jung himself for  being too ""limited"" in its singular focus on sexual drives.  Nevertheless, the 'libido' is at the heart of the unfolding affair  between Jung and Sabina, sparked off after a visit to Vienna to meet  Freud leads to a referral of a fellow psychiatrist Otto Gross (Vincent  Cassel) who urges Jung to let go of his repression of any sexual  desires he has. Meanwhile, the intelligent Sabina has grown  significantly in intellect under Jung's tutelage, and one night, Jung  finally gives in to the sexual tensions lingering between them, in the  process crossing the acceptable boundaries of their doctor-patient  relationship. The irony is all too obvious- the analyst consumed by the  very drive he has begun to disparage- and is further emphasised by  Jung's inability despite his efforts to resist his desires for Sabina.  Despite the sensationalistic nature of their illicit affair, Cronenberg  largely turns down the heat in every scene- even those that depict  Jung's fulfilment of Sabina's sadomasochistic tendencies. Logical  though his decision may be, it also robs the film of any real emotional  edge, so much so that the film engages the mind but not the heart of  its viewer. In the absence of any palpable tension, the more compelling  dynamic becomes that between Freud and Jung, one that requires the  viewer to pay intense attention to the characters' conversations and  voiceovers.  Throughout the course of the film, Cronenberg charts the pair from  steadfast collaborators in the promulgation of psychoanalysis to  embittered foes with divergent and irreconcilable differences. Freud's  disapproval of Jung's mystical interests aside, Freud is also  subsequently appalled by Jung's torrid relationship with Sabina, and  the fact that Freud eventually agrees to Sabina's request to take her  on as his student only widens the chasm between the two intellectual  equals. The ménage-a-trois is intriguing to watch to say the least,  especially in how it illustrates the fragility of such alliances  between great minds.  The fact that Freud and Jung turn out more convincing is also testament  to the strength of Fassbender and Mortensen's acting next to  Knightley's. Continuing his career-defining streak from last year,  Fassbender once again impresses as a young analyst who becomes the  personification of irony as he embraces on a physical level yet rejects  on an intellectual level the sexual desires within him. In his third  Cronenberg film, Mortensen steals the show with his wily portrayal of  the venerable Freud, and the acerbic way he tears at Jung in his  accusations of the latter's 'second-rate mysticism and  self-aggrandizing shamanism' is riveting to behold. The weakest link  here is Knightley's, beginning with a showy chin-jutting,  face-contorting performance and then settling into a perpetually  tightly-wound look that is unfortunately still unable to convince her  audience that she has gotten under the skin of her complex character.  Knightley's limitations as an actress however do not distract from the  fact that this is a handsomely mounted production from a director that  has always had a fascination with the matters of the mind, whether in  his horror forays (""Scanners"" and ""The Fly"") or his examinations of  primordial violence (""History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises""). Be  fair warned though, it will be a challenge for contemporary audiences,  given its erudite subject matter and talky approach- but those looking  for something cerebral will find much intellectual stimulation in the  words and thoughts of three of the foremost brilliant minds of  psychology in the 20th century.",A Dangerous Method

The photo and the people in it are also distractingly beautiful. Maybe this would hit us more if we closed our eyes. The spoken word in psychoanalysis is a big thing.",A Dangerous Method
50,tomsview,Madness in the Method,9,3 August 2013,"This film has a haunting quality that keeps you thinking about it. Although there was plenty of fuss about it before it was released, and despite mixed reviews, the film lives up to expectations – mine at any rate.Keira Knightley is a revelation. As Sabina Spielrein, she is the perfect contrast to Michael Fassbender's Carl Jung and Viggo Mortensen's Sigmund Freud. She is fireworks to their calm introspection and cool detachment; a force of nature, she is one of the catalysts for the rift between the two famous pioneers of psychoanalysis.The movie begins as Freud refers Sabina to Jung for treatment. She has hang-ups resulting from beatings she received from her father, the humiliation of which excites her sexually. Jung helps her overcome her hysteria by taking her on as a pupil and focusing her energies on psychoanalysis at which she excels. However, they also start an affair despite the fact he is married with a child. The affair revisits the humiliations that were quite literally at the bottom of Sabina's problem; the leather belt is never far from Jung's hand.The movie is set at a time when psychoanalysis was just being accepted as a legitimate branch of medicine. Ironically, although Jung disagrees with Freud's concept that all human endeavour is based on sex, his affair with Sabina develops to the point where sex is about all he has on his mind.Jung knows he has compromised his ethics while at the same time his theories about what makes the human mind tick have diverged dramatically from those of his mentor, Freud. On the other hand, Freud is worried that Jung's theories, with what he feels is a supernatural element, will discredit the fledgling field of psychoanalysis. Their association and friendship ends. But the film isn't really about their theories; it's about the men themselves and the cultural, religious and social differences that also set them apart – even jealousies – despite their supposed understanding of such foibles in others.The movie has other strengths. Vincent Cassel brings his unique intensity to the role of Otto Gross, a fellow psychiatrist and patient of Jung whose obsession with sex has led to a breakdown – again confirming Freud's belief that it really is all about sex.Scores for films don't always enhance the drama as well as Howard Shore's does for this film. For ""A Dangerous Method"" he created a thoughtful and thematic orchestral score that ebbs and flows as the drama unfolds – his music helps convey what the actors are feeling and thinking.The film ends as Jung and Sabina part. Her fate is detailed matter-of-factly – in much the same way that Alec Guinness's narration at the end of ""Doctor Zhivago"" told of the fate of Julie Christie's Lara. In both cases the impact is more powerful than if their endings were actually shown – the impression lasts long after the movie has finished.What a fascinating film this is. After all, these people were delving into a realm as mysterious as the bottom of the ocean – the human mind. It's a classy movie with perfect performances all round. No Academy Award nominations? They had to be kidding.",A Dangerous Method
51,proud_luddite,Mostly Good,6,24 December 2020,"This film takes place in the early 1900s in Switzerland and Austria . It focuses on the real-life figures Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, and Sabina Spielrien, a patient of Jung who eventually became a psychoanalyst herself.Director David Cronenberg creates a beautiful atmosphere and a sometimes serious one among academics in a beautiful setting. (It is rare for him to do a film with no violence.) This tone works well in the first half especially with the inclusion of Otto Gross, also a patient of Freud. Gross is also a psychoanalyst ostracized by his professional community for his differing beliefs. One of those beliefs is to always act on one's sexual desires. His arguments with Freud are among the best scenes in this film. These arguments would also influence a major plot element yet to happen.It is difficult to make a feature-length film about psychoanalysis and keep it interesting the entire time for the average viewer. Sadly, the film tends to lag in the second half. It was still an interesting journey to see historical figures - some known and some unknown. - dbamateurcritic",A Dangerous Method

53,itamarscomix,A Non-Psychological Thriller,6,8 March 2012,"Even at his very worst, David Cronenberg always makes interesting films, and A Dangerous Method is no exception - there are some very memorable scenes, some superb acting (a given with Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Vincent Cassel, but Cronenberg really drew a surprisingly gutsy and total performances out of Keira Knightley) and especially some truly beautiful shots. That's enough to be worth the 100 minutes; but A Dangerous Method is unmistakably one of Cronenberg's weakest films, and a very disappointing follow-up to the subtle intensity of Eastern Promises and A History of Violence - films whose dark, dreamy realism it clearly tries to follow.The film's main weakness is lack of decision; it masquerades as a biography of Carl Jung, but doesn't really offer any interesting information for anyone half-familiar with his life story, and what facts it presents are dubious at best. It also fails to show any real insight about the relationship between Jung and Freud; I would forgive all that if instead it showed some insight into the differences between their different methods, but it barely even touched that point, mentioning briefly what anyone who knows anything about either man already knew. Instead, A Dangerous Method is mainly an offbeat romance/psychological thriller which uses Freud and Jung as a backdrop which barely contributes anything to the story. It might have been about the rivalry between two fictional modern-day university professors or surgeons and not change all that much.A Dangerous Mind has plenty of beauty to make it watchable, and a lot of work was clearly put into the costumes and sets - that much I could find in most Hollywoodian period piece, but in a Cronenberg film I want more, and I didn't get that.

56,JohnRayPeterson,To even attempt to capture something adequate about Freud and Jung in 1½ hours was ludicrous.,5,19 February 2012,"To even attempt to capture something adequate about Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in 1½ hours was ludicrous; one cannot get a sense of the importance of the work these two minds have uncovered, and the real toll it took on them, though some of it at least was made clear, up to a point, in the film. For a novitiate or anyone simply curious, this film won't be terribly interesting; I would dare to say one needs to have some notions of psychoanalysis and it's applications to want to see the movie. Of course, there are many who will want to see the movie because of the director's work or that of Mortensen and Knightley; as best as I could tell from the reviews I've read, this will not suffice and you may well be disappointed by the movie, as I was.Despite my best efforts, some time ago, to finish the 1,200 pages (three volumes) ""The Life and Works of Sigmund Freud"" by Ernest Jones, I never did; hence my specific interest in seeing this movie. The movie did spark an interest in giving another go at the Ernest Jones' biography (and beyond) of Freud.From a purely entertainment point of view, I don't think you'll find much to satisfy you here. Viggo Mortensen has much less play on screen than one would have hoped for. Keira Knightley's performance was, for the early part of the movie, before she got over her bouts of hysteria, a bit over the top; she has not had much respite in the last eighteen months, with seven projects under her belt, but I was happy to overlook that given her character's proclivity for sex. Michael Fassbender was the actor who had the lead, and the best part, which in my opinion he managed to perform quite well.I would not recommend the movie as I don't expect anyone I know will be pleased with it; on the other hand, had the movie run long enough to give the audience what many reviewers mention was missing, I would have recommended it. The actors are good and the director has enough talent; too bad the movie fell short on making use of the abundance of material on the subject and the characters did not have time to be developed as they ought to have been.",A Dangerous Method
57,DonFishies,"Fascinating and exquisite, but ultimately disappointing",7,15 January 2012,"Despite being made by Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg, A Dangerous Method was only just released in the Great White North. It was one of my most anticipated films of the fall, and yet another film I missed out on at TIFF (here's an early wish that Cosmopolis will have more than two screenings when it gets announced later this year). So as you can guess, I did not wait very long to see it this past weekend. Unfortunately, I may not have truly considered why it was put off for so long.Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is an upcoming and coming psychologist who has begun to use a newly developed method of analysis on hysterical patient Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley). As he starts to understand her troubles and their overt sexual nature, he begins conversations with another celebrated psychologist, Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen). As his relationship with Spielrein begins to take a sexual turn, his conversations with Freud start to breathe life into what we now know as psychoanalysis.Cronenberg has always evaded definition as a filmmaker, and his work here in A Dangerous Method is no different. You can see the intense close-ups as well as the lure and gaze of a master, but he seems to have been dialed back here. Instead of brutal violence or grotesque body horror, we get a very intimate story that seems very well out of his realm of typical filmmaking. He allows the performances and the dialogue to tell the story, and never lets the sexual elements become too overreaching. I was surprised by just how quiet the film was, and how it felt so un-Cronenbergian (I am certain that is a word by now). It shows his maturity as a filmmaker, and also shows how he continues to challenge himself – never making the same movie, and always flip-flopping on his genres. But as much as I appreciate the effort Cronenberg put forth, I feel the material is the biggest hurdle holding the film back from the awards glory it should have deserved. Much like War Horse and Carnage, the film is based on a play. And because of this, A Dangerous Method feels very constricted and forced to stay within the confines already set out during the writing. It zips along conversationally through a period of around ten years, never stopping to really examine what is going on with the characters. We get small tidbits along the way, and nothing more. It is bad enough that the film feels like it starts and ends in the middle of the story (not unlike other small films from last year like Martha Marcy May Marlene and Fassbender's breakout film Shame), but it is deeply unsatisfying for scenes to begin leading to one thing, ending, and then starting again in a whole different year or time period. It feels very jumpy in this respect, and incredibly difficult to gauge. It is easy to follow along, but frustrating to try and decipher the ""why this"" and ""why not this"". Neither Fassbender nor Mortensen deliver their best work here, but manage to be downright fascinating when they are facing off against each other on-screen. Their chemistry is intense, and watching them spar through psychoanalysis is the clear highlight of the film. Without raising their voices or their fists, you can tell these two are locked in a vicious battle, and it only lets up when they are away from each other. While Mortensen has the benefit of being low-key and an almost background figure within the film, Fassbender is front and centre for its majority. He carries the film well, but you can see he is struggling. We know from Shame and X-Men: First Class that he is a powerful talent, and is destined for the Hollywood elite. So why does he seem to flounder here? Is he having just as much trouble gauging and defining the material as Cronenberg seems to be? I found myself consistently baffled by someone whose performances just seemed to get better and better. But here, he sadly underwhelms. It surprisingly is Knightley who picks up the slack and delivers the film's best performance. From her initial introduction right until her final scene, she is a force to be reckoned with. Her vivid shifts between being hysterical and being in control are spectacular. I originally thought she was overdoing it with her bizarre facial gestures, but as the film went on, they felt tame in comparison to how deep she goes with her performance. She may be the object of the most sexual ambivalence (one of the few Cronenberg-isms within the film), but she is also the most well developed and constructed character. Where Fassbender fumbles, she recovers and carries the film between the portions without Freud/Jung sparring. This is quite likely her best work to date, and an early example of some of the brilliant material she may have in store for the future. Supporting turns from Sarah Gadon as Jung's wife Emma and an all too small appearance by Vincent Cassell are well done, but both feel entirely underused. Both are important in the grand scheme of things, but evidently not important enough to not feel like mere plot devices. In the end, I managed to be fascinated by A Dangerous Method, but disappointed at the same time. I can continue blaming the material, but it feels like of the three leads, only Knightley really brought her A-game. After the glorious double-header of A History of Violence and Eastern Promises, I think I had come to expect too much of Cronenberg. He is a man who became famous for his disgusting other- worldly work in the realm of horror and fantasy. But then, a disappointing Cronenberg film still manages to be a worthwhile endeavor anyway when compared to the rest of the dreck Hollywood pumped out last year.7/10.",A Dangerous Method
58,davidcarniglia,Beautiful Mania,7,3 September 2020,"The settings and cinematography almost makes one want to need some doctoring if it means hanging out in 1900ish Zurich and Vienna. The scenes on and by the Swiss lake, in particular, are magnificent, therapeutic even. The story itself is maybe more complex than it needs to be; either that, or it's not quite always sure where it wants to go. Covering Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Jung (Michael Fassbinder) is a wide-ranging story in itself. Adding in Jung's affair with a young patient, Sabina (Keira Knightley), adds a lot of romance and drama to what otherwise might play as a sort of documentary on psychoanalytic history.It's ironic that it's through sex and sexual attraction with Sabina that Jung begins to distance himself from Freud's theory that attributes all mental issues to sexual hang-ups. Egging him on is patient-turned-mentor Otto (Cassel). Given that Jung's marriage is comfortable but unrewarding (Sarah Gadon as Emma Jung perfectly inhabits the complacent conventionality role). Jung's practice session with Emma on the polygraph-like machine is telling; everything is sufficiently nice and predictable to her except sexuality, which sort of occurs on another planet from her, it would seem. Emma is thus the complete opposite of Sabina.Sabina is nothing if not sensual, mysterious, and beguiling. Not to mention an intellectual, and an eventual protege of Freud and Jung. Emma, on the other hand, is beautiful, wealthy, content, but aloof and staid. Since she doesn't talk much, one scene with her is pretty much like another; whereas Sabina is very expressive, verbally and of course with the body language that originates with her mental disabilities (but is modulated as time goes on). One can't help but wonder if Jung would be happier with her than with his wife. He finally admits that she in effect has helped him in ways that his wife couldn't have.As interesting as Jung's affair with Sabina is, the other major relationship--Jung's friendship with Freud, his mentor--is also fascinating. Fassbinder's Jung seems literally a lightweight compared to Mortinsen's more substantial Freud; but it's important to remember that Freud has a good twenty years on his protege. Some commentators feel that their interaction is too academic and talky; ok, but what else could it be? The collegial atmosphere of their discussions (whether in person or by letter) brings out what people like this do best: think together. These conversations contrast well with Jung's talks with Sabina; she's the dramatic link between the two psychiatrists.The problem with A Dangerous Method is that, despite the erotic scenes and intellectual jousting, it really doesn't stay in 'dangerous' territory for very long. Otto's character, a sort of male counterpart to Sabina, is a loose-cannon who might've livened things up a bit more, but he disappears in the latter part of the movie. On the other hand, the Jung/Freud debate is just fleshed out enough to keep our interest, but might've been developed even further. And despite having two major plots, there were some slow spots. What's the point of including the psychatrists' American visit, for example? There is time in there for one of the good dream interpretation bits, though. And that very artificial look of the ship approaching New York harbor is in distinct contrast to all of the period-correct European scenes.Overall, those with more than a passing interest in Fred and Jung, or the history of psychiatry generally, will probably want to see this. Knightley gives an extremely nuanced performance by doing a sort of Jekyll and Hyde transformation on herself to lend authenticity to her role. A difficult subject done surprisingly well. 7/10.",A Dangerous Method
59,Laakbaar,Jung and Freud as you've never seen them,8,19 April 2012,"I'm not particularly interested in Jung or Freud (although I have been to the Freud house in Vienna). I'm not a particular fan of any of the actors in this film. I am definitely not a Cronenburg fan. If I had known this was a Cronenburg film, I probably wouldn't have gone. I went to this movie because I have a friend who only goes to movies that are realistic and have a possible educational value. He values movies as information rather than entertainment. I prefer sheer entertainment, although I do like historical dramas.Well, this was a film we could both enjoy. It was an entertaining historical drama based on the relationship between Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (played by Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (played by Keira Knightley).When you go to a David Cronenburg film you expect a certain, um, physicality. You get it here from the extreme symptoms shown by Spielrein (and chillingly well played by Knightley). Hysteria was called for and duly delivered.You also get it here from his portrayal of the sexual aspects of these two famous pioneers of psychiatry. First, the men playing Freud and Jung are, well, masculine and quite physically attractive. Who thinks of Freud and Jung in this way? Once I accepted this premise, I realised it added an interesting dynamic. With men like this as shrinks, of course sex would be on the table.Second, we are shown the intimate details of Jung's sexual life. Jung had a sex life like anyone else. I'm not giving anything away by saying he has a relationship with Spielrein. I think most of us have read about this episode, but it was interesting to see it played out. It seemed unethical to me though: ""a dangerous method"", I suppose. I couldn't shake those images of her hysteria--surely this is not someone to get involved with. Psychiatry is apparently a discipline with problems from the very beginning.A viewer without any particular interest or knowledge of Freud and Jung comes out of the movie, not just entertained, but with a much better understanding of the two doctors and of the origins of the differences between Jung and Freud.Cronenburg's depiction of Europe and European manners during this period seemed spot on to me. The actors here are A list and they deliver fine performances. The movie is slow paced and there is not much plot development. With these historical events and Vienna as the subjects there is not much leeway. The scenes with Otto Gross didn't seem to belong in the movie. He didn't seem like someone who needed therapy and at some point I thought he was actually counselling Jung, rather than the other way around.Cronenburg has made an intelligent -- and yet sexy -- historical drama about two key figures from the 20th century.

60,TheSquiss,Be thankful it isn't in 3D.,7,16 June 2012,"The biggest surprise in A Dangerous Method is that Keira Knightly is convincing for ninety percent of the film. There are occasions when she turns on the usual Keira-trying-to-seduce pout but mostly she is very watchable although, when you see what she does with her chin in the early scenes, you'll be very grateful it wasn't shot in 3D! Her early scenes as Sabina Spielrein, a patient in a psychiatric ward, are not easy viewing at all. Her body contorts, she spits her words out and she looks utterly possessed. As Sabina evolves and her mental state improves, Knightly discovers the art of acting underlying madness with a step towards subtlety. For the first time, she convinced me that maybe she isn't overrated. Well, not completely.Less showy but equally as watchable are Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen, as Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud respectively, in a dialogue-driven biopic about their relationship. A Dangerous Method plays out their burgeoning friendship and mutual respect as it expends towards jealously, judgment and finally contempt, bringing about an irreparable destruction of their platonic union.Although his presence is brief it is good to see Vincent Cassell back on the big screen, this time as Austrian psychoanalyst and anarchist Otto Gross, in a performance that is both crazed and humorous while being entirely satisfying.I'm sure a background in psychology and a thorough understanding of the work of all four leading protagonists would be advantageous but not imperative. My knowledge of Yung and Freud is limited to the obvious, principal aspects and I'm ashamed I knew nothing at all of Spielrein and Gross but I was enthralled by all that unfolded on the screen. It's a joy to be drawn into a story through dialogue without needing sweeteners of explosions, murders and shock tactics.It isn't a film for everyone, and perhaps it isn't for many, but those who do go to the cinema to be challenged and educated rather than simply spoon-fed puerile entertainment should leave after the final credits roll with many questions and a need to read more and discuss. The conversation my companion and I enjoyed on our journey home encompassed mental breakdowns, infidelity, religion and breastfeeding. It's that kind of film.Another film review from The Squiss.

61,TheExpatriate700,"Great Intelligent Film, A Rarity These Days",8,16 February 2012,"A Dangerous Method represents a rarity these days: an intelligent film made by adults for adults. It provides a compelling portrait of its characters and their ideas. The plot follows the relationship between Carl Jung and one of his patients, a masochist who goes on to become a psychiatrist herself. In the background looms Jung's engagement and ultimate conflict with Sigmund Freud.The film is enjoyable on a number of levels. David Cronenberg elicits good performances from his actors, with Michael Fassbender leading the charge as Jung. He captures Jung's inner conflicts over his relationships with his wife and his mistress. Viggo Mortensen is revealing, if rather underused, as Freud, showing he can do more than just action roles. Keira Knightley also does well, although she overacts in the beginning while portraying Sabina's mental illness.The true stand out of the cast, however, is Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross, a psychiatrist who doubles as sex obsessed patient to Jung. In a role that could easily have degenerated into exaggeration, Cassel gives a subtle but spellbinding performance. One almost hopes Cronenberg will make a spin-off based on his character.What truly sets the film apart is its willingness to engage with the ideas of its main characters. The film treats its audience as reasonably intelligent and assumes a certain knowledge of Freud's and Jung's ideas, opting to delve directly into their engagement. Moreover, it makes their intellectual sparring interesting. At one point, it is revealed that the characters have discussed their theories for thirteen hours straight, and the audience will not find it at all surprising.",A Dangerous Method

Is David Cronenberg blind and deaf? How could he ever be happy with her performance in those scenes? I mean come on, she is absolutely horrible! Oh it is SO bad. She tosses and turns and presses her hands to her genitals, and coughs and makes faces and pushed out her chin (the worst part) and she stutters and cries and her mouth is crazy and please don't ever make me watch it again! It's worst in the beginning tho, thankfully she tones it down longer into the movie, but still. Her acting is just bad. It's just, downright bad. She does the accent pretty good, but the rest is rubbish. And you know, that is all I have to say. Made me want to smoke cigars, and made feel sorry for Keira Knightly.",A Dangerous Method

64,HelenMary,interesting 'behind the scenes' of psychoanalysis,7,17 January 2013,"Having just visited Freud's house in London only last week, it was lovely seeing his office and chair - I noticed the way Mortensen sat on it was correct - and as a graduate of psychology, this was a no-brainer to watch. I enjoyed it. It was less dark than I was expecting, more about the affair Jung had with his patient than actual psychoanalysis but it did highlight some interesting arguments in the field. It didn't really show Freudian and Jungian method in a great light, if all a novice had to go on was this film! Well acted by the principals Fassbender, Mortensen and Knightley although I do find Knightley's style of acting somewhat annoying generally. That said she had done her homework, and I found her depiction of the patient rather good - much has been made of her jutting jaw but I believe overt uncontrolled physical displays like that are common. Her accent didn't seem that bad to me - it wasn't overdone. I found this one of the best films I've seen her in and I felt that she was rather brave to take on such an emotionally laid bare role and she did with a great deal of commitment and success. Mortensen, I am more familiar in scenes running around with an elf, a dwarf and a hobbit, but he showed his prowess in this; I'm more familiar with Freud than Jung in terms of mannerisms, so felt he was pretty good he'd obviously studied the film archives and was made to look fairly similar. Fassbender was very measured and engaging as Jung and I really enjoyed his journey in the film and was divided on his choices. Cronenberg is a great director and this was a good example of his work; carefully researched and created scenes and vistas, script and score all worked well together. Other than one or two dubbing issues, and overly long time jumps, and a few gaps in narrative (for me) it was excellent. Excellent. Beautiful costumes. I liked the scenes in Freud's office with his couch (having seen it now in person) and I liked the reference to Egyptology that was thrown in, a pet subject of Freud.",A Dangerous Method
65,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Frustratingly pedestrian.,5,28 January 2012,"As a long admirer of David Cronenberg, I eagerly await each of his new films as if I am a young child on Christmas Eve. When announced that his new film, A Dangerous Method, had him working with Michael Fassbender and (for a third time) Viggo Mortensen, two of my favorite actors, as well as Keira Knightley and Vincent Cassel, I thought I must have been dreaming. Adding on that the film was going to be an exploration into the relationship between Carl Jung (portrayed by Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), the gods of psychoanalysis, and this had the makings for Cronenberg's masterpiece. So one can only begin to imagine my dismay when, after a promising first act, A Dangerous Method turned out to be the most inordinately tame and pedestrian Cronenberg film in over thirty years.David Cronenberg made a name for himself in the film community thanks to his studies into dark, controversial topics of sexual obsessions and fetishes, so a story depicting the works of Jung and Freud seemed like a perfect fit for him, and I was hardly able to process how lazily he approached the minds of these men. The first act felt like punch after punch (in a good way), with very stern, rapid dialogues detailing the sexual desires of Sabina Spielrein (Knightley), a new patient of Jung's. Despite Knightley's hilariously hammy performance, which had me close to fits of laughter every time she unhinged her jaw or thrashed about the room hysterically, each scene sizzled with sexual tension and was nailed with precision by Fassbender's stoic portrayal.Anyone who knows the history of the story (or has seen the trailer) knows that Jung and Spielrein eventually engage in a sexual relationship of their own and I believe the release of this tension between the two of them is where the film starts to fall of it's axis. After the incredibly intense and erotic first act, featuring a scene where Jung runs a test on his wife (Sarah Gadon) that is as gripping as anything in cinema this past year, the whole thing begins to fizzle out when that tension is released and it only becomes more and more flat as it goes on.Whenever Jung and Freud are in the same room together the film begins to light back up, as Fassbender and Mortensen engage in a tete-a-tete for the ages, both men succumbed by their intelligence and arrogance to the point where they refuse to see the other as their equal despite their claims to be doing just that. Watching these two marvelously talented actors bounce of each other, it's devastating that the rest of the film couldn't measure up to their skill, and that half of their scenes interacting together are done through them opening notes from one another. The story spreads it's time (quite distractingly) between the Jung/Freud dynamic and the Jung/Spielrein one, and it's in the latter that it completely misses the mark. Once that sexual tension is released, the chemistry between these two practically ceases to exist and each scene feels like a dull exercise in the standard infidelity plot line. When the film reaches it's final act and there are scenes of forced attempts at emotional payoffs, it's impossible to feel anything because I wasn't able to feel anything from the relationship the entire time leading up to it. There's no real progression in their relationship on anything but a surface level and as a result the payoff falls completely flat.It certainly doesn't help that, for all of the controversial eroticism in his career past, Cronenberg takes on the carnal moments of this story with the lazy banality of someone much inferior to himself. Several of the dialogue-driven scenes sizzle with a sexual intensity, but when matters are actually taken to the bedroom they are hit with a dullness that would be impossible to believe came from Cronenberg if he didn't have his name stamped on it. In a year that gave us Pedro Almodovar's The Skin I Live In, the most Cronenbergian film I've seen that didn't come from the man himself, it's unbelievably disappointing that this one is so removed from the standard this genius deserves. It's unlike anything he's done before, and I mean that in the worst way possible.",A Dangerous Method
66,jackasstrange,Very shallow average film,6,19 December 2013,"Despite having the focus on psycho analysis, this film is not as deep as the theme suggests. The Freud-Jung discussions are, unfortunately, a back story which merely served to any purpose in the film. The film is all about Jung's confusion about his sexual life. Otto Grass was responsible for instigating Jung's instincts, so he is by default much more important to the story than Freud was, with much less screen time. Freud was very well interpreted by Viggo Mortesen, but the character seemed pointless in the film. His only useful action was recommending Otto to analyzes Jung. The rest was just pointless dialogs about dreams until he breaks up his friendship with Jung nearly the end of the film.Keira Knightley was terrible in this film. She did all the over the top gestures of a hysteric patient, but she didn't impact the viewer at all, mostly because she was emotionless. Her character is responsible for bringing desire to Jung and therefore making him question the sense of marital fidelity, idea which, as i previously said, liberated by the convincing Otto's arguments.I liked the cinematography, though. Prety weird. The scenario is usually darken than the focal object, which is lightened by an extremely artificial bright lightning. I've seen that kind of lightning in Cosmopolis as well.Anyways, it's not a re-watchable film by any means, and i have doubts if it's worth a watch at all. 5.8/10",A Dangerous Method
67,yris2002,Rather flat and encyclopedic,7,31 October 2011,"I really expected more by this movie, I expected more pathos, but unfortunately it proved scarcely involving and too rational. Nothing to say against the perfect technical execution, and the good acting, but what is disappointing is the screenplay, which should have been, in my opinion, the most significant element of the picture. Dialogues are flat, too rationally aimed at conveying an encyclopedic definition of psychoanalysis, but incapable of conveying empathy towards any of the three main characters, Jung, Freud and Sabine Spielrein. In the end we do not get the depth of each character, and the subtlety of their relationship. Keira Knightely 's character is overacted, excessive,but in the end underdeveloped, just the prototype of a pathologically insane. Freud appears a weird old man, only caring for what the scientific community might think, but not as daring as we think he might have been, Jung is a pathetic unfaithful man, but with an inner fragility we cannot perceive fully. And the complexity of the relation analyst-patient as well as master-disciple never comes out. It's a movie that seems to promise plenty, seems to be always on the verge of revealing something, but never takes off, as if the director wanted to keep a distance from the handled subject, as if afraid of being swept away by the abyss of the human complex mind. Or maybe because the complexity is too great to be thoroughly revealed? maybe, but being this the reason, the result remains unconvincing.",A Dangerous Method
68,Chris_Pandolfi,When Talking Was Experimental,8,24 November 2011,"Sabina Spielrein was one of the first female psychoanalysts, a fascinating achievement given the fact that she was committed to a mental institution for an entire year. After studying medicine and child psychology in Zurich, graduating in 1911, and getting elected into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, she proposed an idea in 1912, namely that the human sexual drive contained both an instinct of destruction and an instinct of transformation. Her death in 1942 at the hands of an SS death squad would all but erase her from the history books until her hospital records, journal entries, and letters to and from Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud were discovered and published; it's now widely accepted within psychiatric circles that her 1912 proposal greatly influenced the works of both men.Spielrein is one piece of the puzzle in David Cronenberg's ""A Dangerous Method."" We follow her, Jung, and Freud in a story that examines their complex relationship, which is simultaneously strengthened and threatened by their field of interest. Academically, they recognize the frailties of the human mind and strive to steer others in socially acceptable directions. Personally, they continuously fall victim to the mental weaknesses they so carefully study, and they become increasingly aware that social acceptability doesn't necessarily translate to common practice. Strange, how even those who categorize people into absolutes can themselves fall within ambiguous parameters. Perhaps it's those very absolutes that drive people towards unhealthy behaviors.One focus is the relationship between Jung and Spielrein, which begins in 1904 and develops over the course of nearly a decade. Initially, Jung (Michael Fassbender) was a fledgling twenty-nine-year-old psychologist, who was married to a gentle but passive woman named Emma (Sarah Gadon) and was expecting his first child. Spielrein (Keira Knightley), Russian-born but able to speak fluent German, was a violent, severely traumatized eighteen-year-old mental patient placed under Jung's care, having been diagnosed with hysteria. Under an experimental form of therapy known as ""the talking cure,"" Jung sits behind Spielrein and listens as she struggles to verbalize her problems. She eventually reveals a childhood marred by beatings and humiliation at the hands of her father. Further sessions unwittingly reveal a sexual proclivity: She becomes uncontrollably aroused by physical force.This discovery brings Jung into the life of his mentor, Freud (Viggo Mortensen), as it validates his theory that sexuality and emotional disorders are intertwined. As the years pass, what began as a cordial, clinical acquaintanceship deteriorates into a stubborn clash of ideologies; Jung becomes increasingly bothered by Freud's unwillingness to reconsider his theories about sex, whereas Freud cannot tolerate Jung's growing interest in spirituality. During their initial correspondence, Freud refers Jung to a psychiatrist-turned-patient, Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel), a drug addicted hedonist; his arguments against monogamy inspire Jung to violate his code of ethics and begin an affair with Spielrein, which continues long after she ceases to be his patient and enrolls in medical school. This is not merely a physical attraction. He has truly fallen in love with her.I have no way of knowing how historically accurate this film is, given the fact that the relationship between Jung and Spielrein has never been substantiated. There is, however, some compelling evidence of their affair, most notably the fact that, unlike Freud, Jung never publicly acknowledged Spielrein's influence on his work. Rumors of other extramarital affairs also continue to circulate. Given this history, it's easy to see why Jung is portrayed as a weak man in the film – intellectually brilliant but emotionally stunted, consumed by guilt over a situation he could have prevented. He continues having children with his wife, and yet he cannot detach himself from Spielrein, who may be troubled but is also incredibly intelligent and sincere.The screenplay by Christopher Hampton, adapted from his stage play ""The Talking Cure"" (itself adapted from John Kerr's nonfiction book ""A Most Dangerous Method""), is well suited for the actors, the dialogue clever, elegant, and packed with emotion. In true psychological form, every line suggests a hidden meaning. This is especially apparent with Freud, portrayed as a piercing intellectual who isn't interested in solutions so much as the underlying problems – which, it seems, all stem from the sexual organs. His scenes with Jung flow like verbal ping pong matches. The scenes with Jung and Spielrein are fascinating in that they're founded on more than curiosity, desire, and passion; they depict the birth of a psychological movement. Herein lies the greatest strength of ""A Dangerous Method"": It's a film to be listened to and not just watched.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",A Dangerous Method
69,werefox08,A Flawed Piece of Work...........Could Have Been Great,6,18 August 2013,"Michael Fassbender plays Carl Gustav Jung, Viggo Mortensen is Sigmund Freud and Keira Knightley plays Sabina Spielrein in this snapshot of the birth of modern Psychiatry. Sadly, director David Cronenberg never gets the pace right and the movie suffers because of this. The 3 principle actors do a good job (although Knightley does a poor fake European accent). There are times when it appears the film is being done in slow motion, such is Cronenbergs lack of feeling for tempo. It is a bold attempt...however...to cover an important piece of history. It is quite amazing how Fassbender and Mortensen looked so much like the characters they were playing. Although there are flaws here, I enjoyed this. The interplay between Jung and Freud is interesting and well done. The complex relationship between Jung and Spielrein is also fascinating in a psycho--sexual way. Not a bad movie, but should have been better",A Dangerous Method
70,PipAndSqueak,"Talking is dangerous, apparently!",7,19 February 2012,"Freud and Jung were jointly responsible for the twentieth century's obsession with sharing introspection by 'talking it out'. The fact that this method has since proved ineffective in the long term shows how non-dangerous it is! The 'danger' of talking about something only exists if it challenges the status quo - e.g. children being believed by other adults when their priests assault them, say. Despite the given title to this offering - nothing of the political dimension of the 'talking cure' is conveyed. In this respect the film is defective. As an entertainment it is, perhaps, more successful. Knightley, Mortensen, Fassbender and Cassel all play their parts with great aplomb. Mortensen particularly is most unlike his real self - adopting a speaking tone rather like the dull monotone speaking Melvin Bragg - but without the adenoids! This makes Freud a far more believable character. Some may be surprised by the non-pouting acting of Knightley. Characterisation not quite true to life but at least marginally believable. Titilation is provided by completely incomprehensible scenes (peek-a-boo scenes of spanking, wet-muslin bath scenes and such like).

71,davidtraversa-1,Complex subject lightened up for the screen.,9,8 April 2012,"Have you ever witness a hysterical person having a crisis? I haven't, probably neither have you. Could that be the reason why to some reviewers (including myself) the histrionics of Keira Knightley as a hysterical patient were embarrassing to watch on the screen? I don' know. Probably real hysteria looks like that but in daily life a witness won't feel what a film viewer feels when being forced to watch incessantly all those facial and body contortions on close ups.After those first over-sized and over-dramatic scenes, the film takes a very natural tempo either on camera work or in tone down dialogs, serene outdoor and indoor scenes, making a very well mannered, ultra civilized and fascinating film indeed.The professionalism of everyone involved in it is impeccable and the script sound as it could be for a one and a half hour film explaining to a general public something as complicated as psychoanalysis involving two of the most important personalities of the last century responsible to have revolutionized and changed the course of history in that field for ever after.Some reviewers criticized this movie as elemental, as too basic while I think it wasn't meant for a professional audience of top psychologists, but merely a very good piece of entertainment for the masses and at the same time with modest doses of knowledge about a theme that in general is unknown to the great majority and vastly complicated.Same goes for the criticism of some reviewers about the sex life of these people when it came to show them in bed doing their own Kamasutra. How far did they expected the sex scenes to go? to the point of impregnation of the female and posterior birth as its consequence?I don't know, I think that that was beside the point in this very serious movie and moreover, that kind of titillation should be look for on a different kind of movie. To me this was an excellent movie very fulfilling from all points of view.",A Dangerous Method
72,Bob Pr.,Disappointing--but also very interesting,8,12 March 2012,"I've gone through analysis--5½ years (about 1,400 fifty-minute hours). I value the experience; it was a great help to me in my professional work (clinical psychologist).I was ambivalent about seeing this film, concerned the subject was too complex and am now almost ambivalent about recommending it. In Roger Ebert's 3½ of 4 star review, he said that people seeing it should be familiar with psychoanalysis (or at least want to be) before seeing it. I very much agree.On the plus side, it reveals fascinating aspects of the relationships between Otto Gross & Jung, Jung & Sabina Spielrein, that I and most people have been unaware of. BUT Freud and Jung were possibly THE most important in founding psychotherapy, the ""talking cure,"" as an effective curative approach to psychological and psychiatric problems. So the focusing on their conflict and alienation plus Jung's transgressions and mistreatment of Sabina (his patient and later psychoanalytic colleague) very much obscures that.For example, Thomas Jefferson & Ben Franklin were extremely important in founding our country and our constitution. If a film focused more on Jefferson's relation with Sally Hemings or Franklin's dalliances with French women while largely ignoring their contributions to their country, that would be somewhat equivalent.(Many User Reviews and comments on this film's Message Board criticize Knightley's ""over-acting."" I can attest, having worked in mental hospitals in the 1950s & '60s, that she did an excellent job of representing that psychotic behavior.)The movie is very interesting but it could've been far more (although it would also have to be far, far longer).It did propel me to Google biographical material on Jung, Otto Gross, and Sabina Spielrein and, not getting enough, to also order the book (John Kerr's, ""A Most Dangerous Method"") on which this movie is based, to read for my fuller understanding. This book is based largely on previously undiscovered troves of letters, documents, etc., of the principals which have come to light only since 1970-90. So for generating my interest, leading me to explore unknown areas, I'd rate it easily 10 of 10.",A Dangerous Method
73,ghost_dog86,Will have psychology majors' on the edge of their seats.,6,15 January 2012,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited Nicole I. Ashland Keira Knightley gives the most off-putting yet polarizing performance of her career, which in turn may be the only reason for anyone to go see ""A Dangerous Method"". Directed by David Cronenberg (A History of Violence, The Fly) and adapted from a play by Christopher Hampton, who himself adapted the story from a novel by John Kerr, this film stars Michael Fassbender (Shame) in his second sexually driven (but much more average) performance of the year as Carl Jung, Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice) as the love interest Sabina Spielrein and Viggo Mortensen (The Road) as the one and only Sigmond Freud. If the names of these characters are not familiar to you already, then I can tell you right now that ""A Dangerous Method"" is not for you.Synopsis: With WWI on the horizon, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a period piece pseudo love story centering around two intertwining story lines. The first, is the tale of a patient turned lover, which follows the young and very married psychiatrist Carl Jung (Fassbender) and his reportedly ongoing affair with the apparent lunatic turned doctor Sabina Spielrein (Knightly), and the parallel story dissects the mentor student relationship (which results in a feud) of the seasoned Sigmond Freud and the aforementioned Jung. I do give Cronenberg a ton of credit here, because while this is not the average Cronenberg Venereal horror film (yes, that is a real term), he does a fabulous job of putting his own dark stamp on the period piece genre. He also does quite notable visual work with stage play material, material which could have played itself out to be more tedious and overbearing than it actually was. In fact, the material/script written by playwright Hampton is the one true element which does fail Cronenberg as well as the audience. In a story which starts off so strong, with Jung waxing on about thought provoking dreams he's been having, Freud staring steadfast as he attempts to find sexual connotations to any and all of his patients psychological woes, and Spielrein acting nuts, Cronenberg struggles to keep this film afloat as ""A Dangerous Method"" reaches closer to its almost shrug inducing climax; and as the subject matter becomes more and more concentrated, gearing itself towards the psychology professors in the audience.The real reason to watch: As I stated before, Knightly not only serves as a scene stealer here, outperforming every actor on screen every time she makes an appearance, but this performance does result in what I will call the greatest performance of her still early career. But just a forewarning: to some Knightly's character will be so out there that it will be hard for them to latch on to her seemingly over-the-top acting. Even for this reviewer, Knightly's performance did come off as very forced right off the bat. But as more of her character is shown to the audience, her performance seems to transform from quite over-exaggerated to extremely engaging. Why she isn't in the discussion for a best actress nomination in at least one of these awards shows is beyond me. Oh, and before I end this paragraph, I must address the other stellar (although sparse) performance from one Vincent Cassel (Black Swan), who plays Otto Gross (another person of note, which nobody outside of the academia of psychoanalysis will be able to place) and is only in this movie for all of five minutes, but within those minutes his presence on screen seems so necessary then when he does take his leave, the film suddenly takes an abrupt entertainment nosedive, which it never recovers from.Final Thought: Unfortunately ""A Dangerous Method"" does falter after the first act, petering into a slew of psychobabble which this reviewer found interesting, but those who are not familiar with this subject matter will not. This is an instance where you have a story surrounding some very interesting and historically relevant characters in the history of psychology, but none of whom are done justice with this material. In the end, ""A Dangerous Method"", while containing some brave and beautiful (at times) direction and Knightly's all too interesting performance, is a movie that most audiences will find themselves needing to do some background character research if they intend on simply getting through the subject matter.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Which is a shame really, because the production values are really top notch. It's not a bad film per se, it just fails to deliver adequate suspense and a compelling narrative.

However based on some of the understanding and the performances I was able to sit for the entire time. Regarding acting I would say that viggo mortensen is a true artist in each sense. Then I should talk about keira knightly. She looked funnier most of the times. I could not help it and was laughing in the starting with her acting of a mentally retarded. She is a good actress no doubt, but here she lacked the authenticity of a mentally retarded and looked funnier. I still praise her acting skills in movies like atonement and pirates.

I had forgotten this guy had directed Atonement a couple of years ago (which I actually liked) but let us not forget it was a drawl as well.Kiera Knightley is definitely the enigma of the film and I agree Vincent Casson should have featured more, perhaps also the Doctors wife to balance the story.I do not think the occasional face to face dialogue and the regular exchange of correspondence between the two doctors discussing sexuality and psychoanalysis - really? lent us to gripping thrilling viewing.I recall a similar method 'einstein meets Beddington' or something like that which focused on two genius in their field exchanging ideas at a critical development time.Not a memorable film in any way and I shall be apprehensive of appreciating another movie from this particular director, though if 'Eastern promises' does have a sequel, I would wish to see that.",A Dangerous Method
78,RockPortReview,A Wonderfully Acted Piece of work!,8,3 December 2012,"""A Dangerous Method"" portrays the relationship between the two fathers of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.In a year (2011) when the Academy recognized and honored some real crap and decided to ignore and brush off films like ""A Dangerous Method"" is easy to see how the Oscars become more and more irrelevant as the years go on. ""A Dangerous Method"" delivers an all-star cast featuring brilliant performances by Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender and the aforementioned Mortensen. This film also has one of the best musical scores of the year. How it was shut out from any Academy nominations is hard to believe. Shame on you Academy voters! (stepping down off my soap box) The film opens in 1904 Zurich, Switzerland with a young woman named Sabina Speilrein (Knightley) being brought in kicking and screaming to a mental institution and into the care of Dr. Carl Jung (Fassbender). Jung has decided that this is the patient he will use a new course of treatment called ""the talking cure"" invented by his colleague Dr. Sigmund Freud in Vienna. The theory being that all people need to heal their mind is to talk out their problems. Knightley deserved a best actress nom for her performance as Sabina. The physical and emotional weight she brings to the character is something to admire. Dr. Jung finds out that Sabina was abused by her father and this led to all kinds of sexual repression. She's developed a fetish so that she becomes excited by being spanked or humiliated. This repression and embarrassment has driven her to the brink of madness.We finally get to meet Dr. Freud when Jung goes to meet him in Vienna. As usual Mortensen doesn't disappoint as the cigar chomping doctor who's opinion is that everything is someway or another is related to sex. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work. Freud and Jung have two different views on interpreting peoples minds. Freud thinks Jung is too much of a mystic, relying on dream interpretation and premonitions. Jung disputes Freud's claim that everything boils down to sex, that it's to simplistic and that Freud himself is quite repressed.If there is one thing that could be said about this film is that like it's doctors it's very cold and clinical. Sabina's Russian accent and mannerism are sometimes pretty robotic, but this is who she is. Sabina is very self conscious and doesn't seem to be that comfortable in her own skin. As treatment progresses Jung can only hold off a physical relationship with her for so long and eventually crosses the doctor and patient line. Their affair while at times intense is still pretty clinical and subdued. Jung is also married and has two girls, but his wife is quite insecure and fears he will leave her if she doesn't give him a son. Questions of whether monogamy is natural are also raised.Over the years Jung and Freud write letters back and forth and Sabina always seems to come between them. Sabina is a very smart and articulate woman and dreams of being a psychoanalyst herself. Her relationship with the two famous doctors give her the confidence and experience to finally realized her dream. This movie was adapted from the book ""A Most Dangerous Game"" and the play ""The Talking Cure"". It is now available in several video formats and should be NOT be missed!",A Dangerous Method
79,axlrhodes,Lacks the depth of it's inspirational subjects.,6,17 August 2012,"Adapted from John Kerr's 1993 non fiction A Most Dangerous Method: The story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein, David Crononeberg's film plays as a sometimes engaging but oddly disjointed delve into the worlds of two of the 20th century's most celebrated thinkers. Central to the story is the developing relationship between Carl Jung (Fassbender) and his patient Sabina (Knightly). Before you've settled into your seat, you're cast in at deep end as we observe a traumatised Seline being carted off to hospital to begin a course of treatment for mental health problems stemming from closeted sexual cravings. I found Knightly's physical depiction of a desperate woman suppressing basic urges, combined with her Russian accent to be a curious mix of admirable commitment and the unintentionally funny. Either side of Knightly stand Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen, and it's the screen-time between Jung and Freud that produce the films most memorable moments. Mortensen plays Freud with such consideration and intelligence that i found myself hanging on his every word. What hurts the film though is it's structural tendency to leap years forward, giving the feeling of skim reading over the fine details. One scene ends, another scene starts months or years later which stultifies character growth and renders any emotional involvement difficult to embrace which is especially problematic given that the story's central drive is building a love story between Jung and Seline. For any director, this isn't easy material to convey and because the story takes place over such a large period of time, perhaps a longer and more patient cut might have produced more satisfying results but as it stands Cronenberg's film sadly lacks the depth of it's inspirational subjects.",A Dangerous Method

Perhaps the people who use these words don't know their meanings.Of course I wasn't expecting anything too dramatic. But I was expecting the movie to be more stimulating than it was. Especially intellectually. But for a movie about psychology it was not even very intellectually stimulating. There were just a few parts where it was. But the rest of it was quite disappointing. One does not even learn hardly anything about psychology or get to hear very many in depth psychological discussions. So I give this movie a 3.",A Dangerous Method
81,Boristhemoggy,Boring,2,29 December 2016,"Keira Knightley is awful in this, totally overacting it and almost caricaturing the role in the process. She ought to stick to comedy or something, anything but this. Viggo Mortensen has no air or authority about his role at all. Michael Fassbender is actually asleep throughout the entire movie. Sarah Gadon is a blinding light in the darkness, but sadly unable to light the way through as the darkness is too strong. The dialogue is absolutely painful, with some bits embarrassingly inappropriate. Knightley's character claiming she ""got wet"" instead of saying she was aroused? The editor wants shot for that remark alone. The breast shots are totally gratuitous as they lend nothing to the story and in fact detract from it. Finally, there are some pretentious conversations between Yung and Freud, but nothing at all that explains either their friendship nor their breaking up. All in all a dire film, no wonder no-one watched it and it made a huge loss.",A Dangerous Method
82,tigerfish50,Strapped into a Straitjacket at Kronenberg Klinik,1,25 September 2011,"Call them what you like - docudramas, faction, biopics - the vitality of films based on real-life events is usually constrained by historical facts. ""A Dangerous Method"" is just another straitjacketed drama relating how the collegial friendship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung foundered on various differences. Like much of Cronenberg's recent work, the film takes itself very seriously, but it's merely a psychoanalyst soap opera which reveals little of the two physicians' 'dangerous method'. The story begins with the arrival of a beautiful, disturbed young woman, Sabina, at Jung's clinic. Within moments the brilliant Jung has unravelled the girl's problem - guilt over masochistic sexual fantasies engendered by her father's corporal punishments during childhood. After some trite therapy sessions, Sabina is soon on the road to recovery - whereupon Jung encourages her to become an analyst. She promptly invalidates this recommendation by initiating an affair with the married Jung - and before too long he is administering severe spankings to his former patient as a prelude to their lovemaking. ""A Dangerous Method"" tries to cover too much ground, and ends up skimming the surface. When Jung and Freud meet up, they engage in pedantic discussions about their ideas, whilst woodenly telegraphing the reasons for their later estrangement. The one provocative episode in the film is Jung's association with Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel), whom he analyzes at his clinic. Gross turns the tables on his therapist - persuading Jung to act on his repressed desires for Sabina - before seducing a nurse and escaping over the clinic's wall to a life of poverty and disrepute. Cassel invests Gross with such dangerous charm that one yearns to join him in his flight from Cronenberg's shallow imagination.",A Dangerous Method
83,jmillerdp,Pretty Routine,5,30 April 2013,"What should be an interesting look at the birth of psychoanalysis is instead a fairly routine biography movie. David Cronenberg is in the director's chair, so you're expecting some fireworks. But, this is all pretty subdued. Viggo Mortensen is overly restrained as Sigmund Freud, top-billed Keira Knightley is frantic as the troubled Sabina Spielbrein and Michael Fassbender is excellent (as always!) as Carl Jung. Things proceed as you would expect, but nothing more.The highlight is Cronenberg's often collaborator, cinematographer Peter Suschitzsky, who provides beautiful images. Otherwise, I am guessing that reading books about these people would be more educational, and more entertaining.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)",A Dangerous Method
84,dhaufrect-1,"""A Dangerous Method"" is a safe bet.",10,30 March 2012,"David Cronenberg has directed a truly educational experience in ""A Dangerous Method"", a book by John Kerr and screenplay by Christopher Hampton. The greatest attribute of this film is the education that it brings to the screen making it available to such a wide audience. The cast is an outstanding one filled with believability and intensity that persists throughout the film. Keira Knightley plays Sabina Spielrein, the hysterical patient of Carl Jung. Her performance is perfection itself and she deserves great credit for her portrayal of an intensely hysterical woman who overcomes her clinical problems only to become involved with her psychoanalyst teacher. Carl Jung is played by Michael Fassbender and he too is convincing as the student of Freud, and a creative thinker in the embryonic stages of psychoanalysis. Viggo Mortensen is an ideal choice for the character of Sigmund Freud, and one can learn a great deal about the political, sexual, and professional risks these people all took in the early 1920's and 1930's. Emma Jung is played by Sarah Gadon, and she too deserves credit for a sensitive portrayal of Jung's loyal and caring wife. And finally one must include Vincent Cassel as the patient of Jung, who changes his moral thinking and produces a schism between Jung and Dr. Freud. This is a real safe winner of a film and should not be missed by fans of the history of psychoanalysis.",A Dangerous Method
85,dharmendrasingh,Never Repress Anything,7,26 February 2012,"'A Dangerous Method' marks a departure for veteran gore-master David Cronenberg. He's made a respectable period drama – sort of. Cronenberg favourite Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender respectively star as psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Both display their acting prowess in cerebral roles, particularly Mortensen, who gives us a foppish Freud. Set in pre-First World War Switzerland, the film opens with Jung receiving his latest patient, Sabina Spielrein, a bright but disturbed young woman who would later become one of the first female psychoanalysts. Treating her was difficult for two reasons: she challenged Jung into believing that the abuse she suffered at the hands of her tyrannical father was pleasurable to her, and she shattered the patient-doctor barrier by seducing him. Jung's method to rehabilitate her proved inauspicious, so he turned to Sigmund Freud, his contemporary and mentor, for advice. Every film outlet going is brandishing the Evening Standard's description of this being 'an intellectual ménage-a-trois'. It's more an intellectual deux ans et demi (two and a half). Jung and Spielrein were intense lovers; Freud hardly got a look in. His relationship with Spielrein was strictly business. Frenchman Vincent Cassel cameos as Otto Gross, a veritable lecher who alternates between psychoanalyst and patient. He acts like Jung's bad angel, persuading him to lose his inhibitions and yield to his baser instincts ('Never repress anything', 'Maturity is surrender'). Some of his views had a bearing on Jung's own theories. Freud was very rigid in his belief system. All neuroses, he said, could only be examined in sexual terms. Jung was somewhat more open-minded. He wanted to explore telepathy and even mysticism because he wanted to give people the ability to change and improve. Freud considered this to be playing God and maintained that their job was simply to persuade people to accept the world as it was; not swap one delusion with another. I most enjoyed the academic quality in the many debating scenes. Theories are explicated and ideas traduced; interesting for anyone keen to learn more about psychoanalysis. However good the chaps are, they don't come close to Keira Knightley's fiery and passionate portrayal of Spielrein. She might be the one bending over on Jung's knee for a bit of S&M, but she's the one holding the whip. This may well be her finest performance to date.www.moseleyb13.com",A Dangerous Method
86,JimmyCollins,Kiera will wow you constantly.,8,9 February 2012,"I would not call myself a Kiera Knightley fan, there's something about her that is kind of annoying to me, but I will say that my opinion was totally changed after watching A Dangerous Method, obviously this film boats 3 very popular actors but this is hands down Kiera's film. Her performance is astounding and the thought that she has basically been ignored this awards season is truly questionable. Yes, this year there have been a huge amount of extremely great performances from females but I've seen a lot of them and I think Kiera was one of the best. The storyline was all very fresh for me, I hadn't any previous knowledge of the subject before, but I found that you get the direction that the story is taking rather quickly, and it's interesting to see how psychology was handled in the past.The male cast in this film are impressive as well, particularly Viggo, he is one of those actors that playing complex characters just comes so easily, and the it boy Michael Fassbender is also his usual calm impressive self.This movie is extremely entertaining in parts, seeing Kiera convulse in agony and just be plain crazy is highly entertaining and will surely leave an impression in your mind. Another positive thing I found with this film was the fact that it doesn't outstay it's welcome, the short running time is strange but it doesn't feel as though it jumps too fast through things, a lot of the time these serious dramas are overlong and drag a tad. Check it out, if only for Kiera and her freakishly amazing acting.",A Dangerous Method
87,basilisksamuk,Relax and listen to the silence,8,1 March 2012,"I found this film to be exciting, gripping, well directed and exceptionally well acted. It seems that I am in the minority. My only gripe is that it wasn't especially cinematic and I would guess this is behind some people's disappointment. I can imagine that this would work well as the stage play from which it was derived or as a radio drama. However, the recreation of early twentieth century Vienna is impeccable and the costumes are terrific (and I speak as someone who is not a fan of frock films). I was also mightily impressed by the sparing use of music and the fact that the major talking scenes did not have music cues but were performed against a background of silence or quiet ambient sounds. Perhaps this is behind some of the claims of boredom by other reviewers. Personally I was glad of the space to be able to listen to the arguments and reflect on them as the film progressed. It is true that sometimes there is a tendency to use clichés and occasionally it explains things that don't need explaining but compared to the average Hollywood movie the script was clear, intelligent and told you what you needed to know, when you needed to know it.As for the acting I couldn't fault it. Both Mortensen and Fassbender played their parts in a manner that made me believe their characters could carry the authority you would expect to see in Freud and Jung and the descent into enmity seemed believable and inevitable. I don't understand the anti- Knightley movement and her portrayal of hysteria seemed compelling to me. If it was truly OTT, as so many claim, then that's the director's fault not hers. Her acting always seems more naturalistic and more believable to me than that of Meryl Streep, for instance.The Oscars are a mystery to me. Why, for instance, did the Artist, a perfectly pleasant but flawed movie do so well and this film gets ignored? I wouldn't promote it for best picture but I'd certainly like to see the three lead actors in contention.BTW no review by me would be complete without a gripe about the rubbish CGI that creeps into A Dangerous Method as it does in almost every movie made today. It's the scene where Freud and Jung are sailing into New York and it's terrible.",A Dangerous Method

Aside from the first Pirates of the Caribbean film Knightley is an awful actress i.e. even a busted clock is 'right' twice a day.The only decent performance was by Mortensen as Freud but he was not the focus of the script, that's Jung.What is confusing is why is it directors choose thespians that have no talent?

Why she was not nominated for an Oscar for this performance baffles belief. Both Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen also give wonderful performances as Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud (who was the lead - Mortensen is first-billed but Fassbender's part was bigger?) The subject of 'A Dangerous Method' is, of course, one that is bound to be of more interest to intellectual minds than the majority of today's typical superfluous box-office product and, for that reason alone, its popularity will be inevitably be limited. Nevertheless, the topic is sensitively and very well presented by director David Cronenberg such that most viewers who take the time to watch it will appreciate not only Sabina Spielrein's moving story but the whole historical significance of what is, today, taken so much for granted - psychiatry.Personally, I consider the 99 minutes spent viewing 'A dangerous Method' plus goodness-knows how much more time spent on Google reading background material very well spent and recommend anyone to do the same.",A Dangerous Method

So how should this make us feel? Well it's a highly enjoyable costumed romp through the early days of psychoanalysis, made with flare and driven by strong performances. There is ample opportunity for DC to provide some signature body-shock moments, which he does, and these are central to a brave turn by Keira Knightley, whose performance is the stand-out (arguably topping the Fass himself, no mean feat).

The movie is a bit fragmented; the continuous thematic and narrative shift of focus has left me totally detached (I guess Hampton is to be blamed for this). Moreover, apart from the smart dialogues, the movie lacks dramatic intensity. Only Viggo Mortensen's performance stood out, the rest were just mundane.

Suddenly Vincent Cassell appears and we are reminded of what real human beings are like. Unfortunately he soon disappears and we are left with the stolid Fassbender, the deranged Knightley, and the pleased-with-himself Mortenson. I must admit that I gave up on this film at the halfway point. Thus far it was so uninvolving, empty and humourless (Cassell excepted). I couldn't care less about the dreary affair between Jung and his well-to-do nutter, and I feared that Knightley may be further encouraged to jaw-jut and teeth-gnash; Jung would probably continue to suffer and repress, and Freud to smirk.

The movie didn't really tell, teach or enlighten, nor does not really have any sort of narrative arc, just simply fading in as Spielrein meets Jung and fades out randomly a number of years later doing nothing but presenting how these two brilliant minds became friends.Are the performances good? Well...yes....I suppose. Fassbender, having an excellent year with this critically acclaimed role, and looking at an Oscar nomination for ""Shame,"" I feel does the best work here, yet his performance has seemingly been somewhat muted by the attention Golden-Globe nominated Mortenson has received...in a role that I am not all together convinced deserves any nomination, Glove, Oscar, or otherwise. He was good, but isn't he always? I just did not find his performance....riveting.Knightly, on the other hand, just left me wondering if she played the role of the terrible mentally unstable Spielrein with acute effectiveness or if she did a spectacle of over-acting. Watching her first scene with Fassbender rendered me terribly uncomfortable, but maybe that is precisely what her confessions to Dr. Jung were meant to do as her body contorts and her jaw stretches as she lets her words bubble out like boiling milk.Is ""Dangerous Method"" a well-made film?

95,joncha,Not a good lesson for neophytes,6,21 August 2020,"Excellent performances by Fassbender, Mortensen, and Knightly. But if you didn't understand the differences between Freud and Jung's theories of psychoanalysis before, this movie, while focusing on their relationship and eventual separation into two distinct schools, probably won't help to clarify things. This is especially frustrating because the film is long, heavy on conversation, and little ""action."" It also has the curious habit of focusing on things and never clarifying or explaining them. For example, Jung has a tendency to feel in his gut that things are going to happen, and when they eventually do occur, he tries to develop a theory rather than just writing them off as coincidences. There's also Jung's tendency to eat a lot and quickly, without that ever being noted. Was the audience just supposed to realize this was some form of transference of his inner needs? And when Freud collapses, we think he's going to die or has died. But then in next scene he's back on his feet corresponding with Jung again.",A Dangerous Method
96,SnorrSm1989,"Quite straight-forward, though somewhat interesting to compare with earlier portrayals of Freud",5,8 January 2012,"One may wonder whether the basic story of Sigmund Freud requires another cinematic interpretation. Has not the essence of his theories, contradictory and diffuse though they might appear at times, been sufficiently summarized by a number of directors already? While I'm sure that opinions will differ, my personal estimation is that there is, indeed, little need for another encyclopedic coverage of Freud's life and work. Not surprisingly but disappointing nonetheless, David Cronenberg's A DANGEROUS METHOD is fearsomely close to being a total waste, in my opinion; even so, a few things do save it from such a doom in the end, however hesitantly.Don't get me wrong: the professional disagreements between Freud and Jung, as well as the relationship between Jung and Sabina Spielrein should be interesting enough a subject for an entire mini-series on TV, given that the interpretation provided an unexpected twist of sorts. The disturbing thing with this film, then, is perhaps not so much its very subject, even though we have seen these events brought to light in other films; the problem is rather how narrow it turns out to be in its presentation of matters which most of us have, at the very least, some basic acquaintance with already. Even in the presence of competent performers such as Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender, what should serve as a complex story, the relationship between Jung and Spielrein which was seemingly crucial to his (and, in time, her's) development as a psychiatrist, is ultimately reduced to a romance. And even if accepted as such it fails, as the script barely explores Jung and Spielrein's relationship any further than through a superficial angle, turning the two of them, and also Freud, into little more than caricatures. We are made aware that Jung revolutionized the perception of modern psychology, being less reluctant than Freud to evaluate possibilities differing from his own personal theories, but in the process, Freud's initial influence more or less seems to be denied; whatever one may think of Freud, a glance at what others suggested we might do with the mentally ill prior to his entrance should make his impact inevitable. Which is not to say that I think Freud's theories, on a general level, have aged favorably, but without Freud being there in the first place, there would possibly have been no Jung either, and this film fails to even hint at this, in my opinion.So what are the more pleasing aspects of A DANGEROUS METHOD, then? For one thing, it is quite magnificent to look at; the sets look quite authentic, and provide a stimulating aesthetic experience, complimented by an occasionally beautiful soundtrack. I also found the film interesting to compare with earlier portrayals of Freud; especially one film, simply entitled FREUD (1962), proved an interesting comparison as to how the presentation of Freud seems to have largely changed in popular culture in the last fifty years. Directed by John Huston and starring genius actor Montgomery Clift in the title role, FREUD covered the early professional years of the psychoanalyst, portraying him as a sort of ""misunderstood rebel,"" far more sympathetic (if not compromising) than the bombastic gestalt of this present film. In A DANGEROUS METHOD, Carl Jung has to a large degree taken the role Freud had in Huston's film, which one may or may not like, but it does in any case reflect the popularity Jung has come to enjoy in our present time as opposed to the more arbitrary Sigmund Freud. Despite all my reservations, I do not think A DANGEROUS METHOD is a truly terrible film. It might work as a fair presentation of Freud and Jung to the completely unfamiliar. However, a friend of mine remarked that the film felt quite ""unnecessary,"" and I find myself agreeing with this. The often beautiful sets and locations could have been used to better avail.",A Dangerous Method
97,howardeisman,A Dangerous Assumption,5,14 November 2012,"I far as I can see, the target audience for this film was people interested enough in psychoanalysis to care about its history. Since psychoanalysis is divided up into numerous camps of waring practitioners, there is no canonical history to depict. This film takes a decided Jungian stance. While Jung has some enthusiastic followers, by and large he was a theorist who didn't really have much to say and he couldn't say it well. Thus, the implicit theme of this work: HOW JUNG BECAME JUNG is not a mystery which would intrigue many people. I number myself among the multitudes who could not care. What's left? A sexy story of a doomed sexual relationship: crazy sexy kid and horny doctor? Sorry, it just didn't have any sexual bite. How about the riff between Freud and Jung? Let's forget about the obvious ""who cares?"" Their theoretical differences, as discussed, contained no drama and nothing of any intellectual substance. They were just characters reading their metaphorical teleprompters and staying on message.With no compelling story to tell, historical characters as protagonists who have fallen out of popular favor, it was a dangerous assumption that this film could find an audience.The scenery and customs where great.

98,sribornagain-394-460163,Informative yet entertaining,7,13 June 2012,"""A Dangerous Method"" based on the play ""The Talking Cure"" which in turn is adapted from the book ""A Most Dangerous Method: The story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein"" by John Kerr deals with episodes that led to the intertwining of the lives of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung & Sabina Speilrein during the days when Psychoanalysis was still in its infancy. Directed by David Cronenberg , the adapted screenplay is by Christopher Hampton. Movie traces how Jung got into contact with Freud by means his patient Sabina Spielrein who ironically is also the reason for the frictions to develop between them later on. It also shows how Psychoanalysis got into prominence & how the most dreaded consequence of Psychotherapy , Transference and Counter-transference developed between Jung & Sabina , how it affected their professional lives. Finally it also give us glimpses of how Freud & Jung developed professional divergence after initial conformity which affected Freud deeply for he has thought of Jung has his successor in carrying forward his theories of Classical Psychoanalysis & his theories of Sexuality as the basis for all neurosis.Though the movie is educative , it doesn't come across with a documentary feel to it. It has all the elements of an engaging emotional drama with some sparkling chemistry between Keira Knightly & Michael Fassbender (Sabina & Jung respectively) and Viggo Mortensen & Michael Fassbender (Freud & Jung). Especially the manner in which the director is able to create the viewer feel the sexual tension that is developing between Sabina & Jung is amazing. Also the palpable friction that develops between Freud & Jung is enacted well.Part of the appreciation should go to the cast. Michael Fassbender is the star of the movie , not to be overshadowed by Keira , he is able to stand his ground & comes out with flying colors. As the introverted Jung , who tries initially to repress the sexual drive he has towards his patient but finally giving into it and also a devoted disciple of Freud who gets into conflict with himself unable to stand up to him when he starts to have difference of opinion , Michael has excelled in his portrayal. Keira Knightly is reliable as ever. Initially as a psychotic patient troubled by all those delusions & hallucinations, later as a seductress having developed transference towards her therapist, then turning sinister and cold when she feels cheated by her lover & finally as one of the earliest female Psychoanalyst , Kiera is able to bring about various shades of Sabina in her portrayal with conviction. The last but not the least Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud is excellent. Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross is also convincing.Peter Suschitzky's cinematography & Howard Shore's background score supports the narration to a great deal.On the whole , ""A Dangerous Method"" is an interesting watch not only for those who are into Psychology but also general audience as well. It is fascinating to have a peek at the personal lives of these doyens of Psychiatry, their strengths & vulnerabilities , loyalty & betrayal , devotion & differences .Bottomline : Informative yet entertaining",A Dangerous Method
99,andrewburgereviews,The power of words,8,5 April 2020,"The real showcase of David Cronenberg's ""A Dangerous Mind"" is the fact that the capability of a psychologist relies solely on his powers of convincing. Cronenberg uses words as weapons of choice for a battle which is much more exciting than it looks on-screen. This movie is not boring as much as it is lacking a certain climax. Happily, its academic conversations don't flop despite their elevated vocabularies due to the powerful performances of the two leads: Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud and Michael Fassbender as Carl Jung.The contradictions between the two is, at its surface, about the nature of their science. Freud was secular, he was hellbent on remaining fixated in the scientific realm while Jung was more experimental. He was fascinated with telepathy and parapsychology. It is the eternal fight between conservatism and futurism, science and faith, mind and soul. It might not be anything new, but it was at the time. I love their conversations despite not completely understanding everything--and if you think you do, trust me, you don't either--not unless you're a psychologist, of course. For me, who have always wondered how pioneers really think, what makes them special, it is fascinating to see two such people go toe-to-toe behind closed doors. I didn't even care that I felt like a student coming unprepared to an exam, I love their superiority complex--their inevitable smugness.One of the best examples of the power of convincing was when Jung admitted as a patient a fellow psychoanalyst--Otto Gross. He was a hedonist who encouraged his patients to give in to their desires--especially sexual. He is a dangerous man because he is both unstable and brilliant. Appearing the first time, I could never imagine agreeing to his ideas, but his charm, abilities with words and argumentative powers drew me in and I felt just like Jung as he was struggling to cope with his patient's philosophies. In just a few minutes, a set-in-stone idea and law like don't sleep with your patients was reduced to a debatable moral choice.When I started writing this review I had a different idea for the rating of this movie--it was lower. But the more you discuss this movie, the more it drags you in. Most of its power relies in Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), one of Jung's patients who was brought in a manic state of madness, only to become a student, fellow psychiatrist and Jung's mistress in a couple of years.In the ending, we see Jung in a state of confusion and nervous breakdown. A state from which he eventually recovered to become the world's leading psychiatrist. But in that last scene, it was Sabina who was helping him--he was the patient. Which led me to realize that in the matters of the mind, some of us can be doctors, but all of us can be patients--a realization to which Jung also arose: ""only the wounded physician can hope to heal"".",A Dangerous Method

I would say the movie had that affect on me because I saw too much dialogue and not enough action.

101,SteveMierzejewski,A film that's as good as you make it,8,20 April 2012,"After reading the summary of this film, there was one thing that worried me about watching it. That was Keira Knightley. I know I'm in the minority here but, in my opinion, she has a tendency to overact, and when I can tell someone is acting, I'm unable to enjoy the movie, simply because the whole point of watching any movie is to enter into an alternate reality. Bad acting or overacting is probably the best way to kill the idea that such an alternative reality is possible. Reading the summary, and reading that Knightley was playing a hysterical woman, made me consider whether I should waste my time on this film. Now, I can't say that she didn't have her overacting moments, she did; however, she was believable enough and good enough to keep me involved. It should be said that this would be a difficult role for anyone to play. The other members of the cast, Michael Fassenbender and Viggo Mortensen, were well-suited to their roles of Jung and Freud, respectively. If I had one problem with the cast, it was with Sarah Gadon, who played Jung's wife. It was not her acting. She was, quite frankly, too attractive. You really have to suspend reality to believe that Jung could leave her for anyone.If you know something about Jung and Freud's philosophical differences, you'd have an easier time getting into the film. This is not an action movie. Don't go out for a beer or try to watch this while fixing dinner. If you don't give it your full attention, you're going to think this is the most boring film ever made. Jung's moral dilemma and transformation is carefully presented, but it is subtle. I'm not giving anything away by saying that if you don't understand this process, much of the film won't make much sense. There is a romance here, and a good one, but it would be incomprehensible without understanding the transformation of the two participants and their psychological ties.So, if you're tired of the run of the mill action film or predictable romantic comedy and want something that is more intellectually challenging, this is a film that you might want to give a try.

102,don2507,Oedipal Conflict at the Multiplex (or rather the art house),7,26 April 2012,"I rented this film because I have a moderate interest in psychoanalysis (which has retained significant cultural influence while its scientific interest has seemed to decline with each decade -- it appears essentially uncovered today in university psychology departments), and wanted to see a film portrayal of its early development. The film nicely depicted the interaction of Freud and Jung, the two giants of psychoanalysis, showing their initial compatibility followed by a growing disagreement resulting in their estrangement. The issues relating to their estrangement seemed to be personal as well as intellectual and were reasonably well clarified by the film's script. Freud initially saw Jung as his heir apparent, both because of his psychoanalytic contributions and his non-Jewishness which he felt would broaden and legitimize his movement, and Jung looked on Freud as the father-founder of psychoanalysis requiring some deference on his part. Their eventual disagreements over Freud's exclusive reliance on the sexual origin of the neuroses and Jung's more wide-ranging incorporation of religious themes and the occult could have been better covered by lengthening a 99 minute film, but a 2-hour film devoid of much dramatic tension (see below) would probably have proved tiresome.Films that deal with psychoanalysis, or least with the psychoanalytic treatment of a patient, are usually amenable to dramatic tension and its subsequent resolution as the traumatic and repressed memory (the source of the neurosis) is uncovered in the final therapy session and insight and self-acceptance are achieved. (Imagine the difficulty of inserting great drama into a film using cognitive therapy rather than psychoanalysis with its bizarre dreams and buried traumas.) This film, in contrast, is more cerebral and devoid of much dramatic tension. The Sabina Spielrein character, suffering from a form of hysteria, is used in part to link Freud and Jung and her ""cure"" is achieved fairly early. It seemed to me that she overacted her part during her neurotic phase. I thought Viggio Mortenson's portrayal of Freud was intriguing with the depiction of controlled authority and a logical mind surrounded by cigar smoke. Freud ""ex-communicated"" Jung for delving into areas that Freud felt were unscientific; I would have preferred to see directly Jung's motives in exploring these areas rather than just Freud's reaction to them. The film shows Freud presiding over his movement with little toleration for deviation from the ""party line"". The film's essence shows Otto Gross (a patient of Jung's ) advocating ""freedom"", or accommodating your instinctual drives, Freud and Jung saying in part that repression of those drives contributes to civilization, and Jung groping for other dimensions of human meaning.",A Dangerous Method
103,rcastl2335,Methodical mediocrity,3,2 January 2012,"This movie is a sad disappointment and borders on unintentional comedy. Keira Knightley does a fine job as a Jung/Freud patient, although her performance bears a resemblance, in its twitchiness, to Natalie Portman's in Black Swan. However, when Knightley finally decides which accent to use (for awhile it veers between her native Brit and a Russian voicing) she's very good and makes the character her own. Michael Fassbender/Jung and Viggo Mortenson/Freud are just a step and a half from parody. Fassbender bears a striking resemblance to the young Christopher Plummer while Viggo looks remarkably like Sam Shepard and it's often hard to get past the look-alike factor. The men spend the entire time speaking in clipped British accents (portraying citizens from Switzerland and Austria!) as Mortenson smokes cigars incessantly, wearing gloves 90% of the time. This may be accurate but it's certainly not an interesting way to show character. It's rather like the annoying sunglasses play of certain television actors. The movie, however, is visually breathtaking and Sarah Gradon, playing Jung's wife, is the most beautiful actress I believe I've ever seen. She's absolutely stunning, even more exquisite than Keira. The usually dynamic Vincent Cassel is the other character in the film and, while he's a favorite actor of mine, is squandered playing a drugged out wastrel/protégé of Freud's. The epilogue of the film is brutal and mean-spirited. Cronenberg has moved far from his early indie film roots but he still has a weak eye for scripts. He's taken a wonderful idea for a film and frittered it away. C-",A Dangerous Method
104,petrelet,Intellectually provoking but distant,7,22 July 2016,"This is a movie about intelligent people who are trying to elevate their guesses about human nature to the level of a new science. But the fact that they are intelligent doesn't turn their guesses into objective truth, or cause them to become wise, or make them into role models.Let me stop here and say that frankly this is a difficult movie to review partly because it really doesn't conform to expectations. Not that it should. On the one hand these (Jung, Freud, Spielrein, Otto Gross) are people dealing with their own desires for sexuality, power, freedom from social restraint, and so on. On the other hand they are trying to turn their personal insights or ideas into scientific dogmas. On a third hand they are trying to argue about these dogmas with each other while engaging in sex and in power games with each other, so you see people on the screen whose bodies are interacting on a physical level while at the same time carrying on a running intellectualized commentary and discussion on themselves. This is somewhat disconcerting to watch and could easily be developed into a comedic sketch.Another issue for the moviegoer is that the insights of the early psychoanalysts haven't exactly stood up to the inquiries of modern science the way Einstein's theories have. From the modern standpoint - well, mine anyway - the arguments between Spielrein and Freud and Jung about (say) whether the sex instinct is creative or whether it must incorporate the death instinct and embody destruction of the individual ego (more or less) seem to be really a lot like religious arguments in the early Christian church about whether the Spirit proceeds from the Father or not. There are no testable hypotheses, no material referents, just talk. Now, I'm not claiming that the seekers in question are made out to be hypocrites. They are at least somewhat sincere - even Gross, who claims that psychological health is to have as much sex and as little moral restraint as possible. And they aren't charlatans. Spielrein comes to Jung as his patient in a horrible mental state; through his ""talking cure"" she becomes a respected professional. Of course he also gets into a sexual affair with her. But to be fair psychiatric ethics didn't exist yet, and this is Vienna circa 1906, when professional men like Jung have wives and children and also mistresses apparently as a matter of course, so it's not reasonable to castigate Jung as some kind of exploitative monster towards his patient and towards his wife without mentioning that it was a monstrous time and a monstrous world. It's not as if the camera isn't critical of him.Still, it's fair to say that no matter how sincere they think they are, they are all rationalizing and fooling themselves to some degree, though not so much each other. Freud, for example, who at one point calmly declares that of course he bears no ill will to Jung, he merely can't support Jung's stupid primitive religious idiotic nonsense, or words to that effect. Things like that are interesting and worth seeing the movie for, and the performances are pretty seamless - I really have to put in a shout out to Sarah Gadon who plays Emma Jung with great delicacy. But if you want dramatic progression or a third-act climax (SPOILER) you really won't get any. They go their ways and ultimately you get biographical notes before the end credits. But on the plus side a few days later you may start thinking about issues raised in the film, like, were these people just successful neurotics, or were they intuitive helpers but failures at creating a science, or was their science more successful than that, or were they really sort of like founders of a religion after all? So I'm glad I saw it.",A Dangerous Method

It felt chopped up, like the most interesting aspects of the film ended up on a floor somewhere.Jung and Freud are real-life fathers of modern day psychoanalysis whose works I have always remained interested in. Yet from what I know about their lives and their theories (especially Jung), there must have been some other script or movie that could have been written that would work a lot better than this one did.From the moment Keira Knightley came on the screen playing a mental patient my interest lessened. The more I saw her on screen in what felt like extreme overacting mode, I started thinking of other movies. The more and more her character showed up I began to wonder why they advertised this as a film about Freud and Jung, because in the end it wasn't.I couldn't get into this movie. I enjoyed the scenes between Jung and Freud and a lot of the psychoanalysis that went on in the film, but as I said before, there must have been some other way to make a movie about these two that was more . . . creative. Something that really went into the minds of these two characters. Something truly reflective of their work, because watching two psychologists sending letters back and forth wasn't really that enthralling, and watching Keira Knightley act strange and make funny faces was a huge turnoff.",A Dangerous Method

One might have guessed, I suppose, that a film about the ""talking cure"" would be a ""talking bore,"" but still: With Cronenberg at the helm and Keira Knightley and Viggo Mortensen in the cast, so much more was possible. Ah well, what did Freud teach us about wish-fulfillment fantasies? Mortensen is an insufferably pompous and idiotic Freud (whatever you think about the man, he was erudite) and Knightley's acting consists of a series of teeth-baring grimaces that are painful to watch. Cronenberg's vision is clearly this: Jung=good, Freud=bad. I'd say ""fair enough,"" except that it isn't a fair representation by a long shot, and neither man comes across as what each was: a genius. Freud is self-satisfied and inarticulate, and Jung is dithering and self-loathing. More to the point, the director and writers apparently decided that the average moviegoer would be too stupid to understand anything about psychoanalysis or the very real differences between Freud and Jung, so it sort of glosses over all that dull detail. So much so that you couldn't possibly understand what the fuss was all about.

107,ReadingFilm,The best VD I've ever contracted.,10,14 August 2019,"Freud is misread by Jung from the start as fatherly, as Freud brings the photo to his heart, revealing some kind of narcissitic homoeroticism was at play--if not in the literal sense then in the sense of the master v the protege. Look how it shows Freud's family once and never again. Mostly it shows him in his den making faces wishing someone would strike him dead. The play brings this as David v Goliath with his authority being chipped away. Jung as the candidate must debase and humiliate himself to explore Freud's sexual freedom and it scars him for life. The abyss stares back. (There is also an absurdest black comedy component where all this is just to get their rocks off.) What's resonant is the trap of being in the narcissist's grasp. Deliciously, the villain's plot is cerebral: a certain idea in despair. It is why Jung escalates in those mic dropping letter exchanges. The film presents Freud's rule as this foregone treatise of humanity's lowness, because it mirrors Cronenberg's own atheistic world view of the misanthrope, allowing this frame of mocking Jung's naivety and admiring Freud, a perfect heroes journey--Freud is the Cronenberg stand-in after all--then if I'm overstating him as malicious, there he functions here, at least he's weary, daring to be proven wrong, skeptical... he has human history on his side after all. Then with perspective here he embodies a voice of the historic Jewish trauma. Enter the woman bridging and dividing them, of course in noir she would drive them mad with jealousy, and with Freud having no interest in women, she must do so via intellectual cuckoldry: taking Freud's patients, confessing it's his ideas she prefers. ""We're both Jews, never forget that."" The other key is the film also insists history in the post-script, that all this religious idealism was regressive in the 20th century nuclear age, vs Jung's Plato's forms, instigates Jung's Eyes Wide Shut trip through hell. Problem is it revels in it a bit much, Cronenberg seems too certain in the Freudian as Jung does seem to find actualization in the carnal to conclude with, dirty love haunts him. In this way it reveals the 20th century not Freud v Jung. Because did the film even watch itself? Look how it functions the way any comic book operates: the battle and co-dependence of good v evil. Then through is its very structure of a storytelling order that would please us, dueling scientists, femme fatals, monsters, heroes journey, labyrinthic villainry, reflects Jungian forms of storytelling no matter how much he loved spanking the girl.

108,MovieGeekBlog,Riddled in clichés and boring,5,19 November 2011,"I can't remember the last time when I have been so much in disagreement with the general critical response for a movie Everywhere I look I seem to hear and read high praises for Cronenberg's latest work, and yet I am willing to bet that few of those who claimed to like it so much would be ready to watch it again. As far as I am concerned I am struggling to find something positive to say (well, yes, nice costumes) and the only reason why my vote isn't any lower is because I am willing to admit that I might have not been in the right mood for it. Even in his most flawed films, Cronenberg has always been an interesting director, or at least able to create not only an almost palpable atmosphere, but also a particularly defined style and vision which set him apart from the usual Hollywood crowd. And yet this one seems a film with no direction whatsoever. Not only each sequence felt random and inconsequential as if not necessarily edited in the right order, without any real feeling of natural progression from the previous one into the next, but also it was all so static and lifeless that sometimes I even wondered whether anyone was actually directing at all. At no point I felt any sympathy for any of the character: in fact, not only I did not like any of them, but I didn't even hate them either. I just didn't care. And this is is a rather strange thing to say, because on paper, a film about the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud (and consequently the birth of psychoanalysis) sounded to me very intriguing indeed. Sadly, pretty earlier on into ""A dangerous Method"" I realised that this wasn't really the type of film I was hoping to see. I found myself uneasy right from the word ""go"", that is from the moment I saw Keira Knightley overacting like never before and stretching her chin to new unbelievable levels, as if screaming to the audience ""I want that Oscar!!"". Well, darling, not this time. Then, after the early screams, it all calmed down a bit and the dialogue started and that's when it got worse! For a film which should rely on words more than action itself (especially given the static nature of it all), I found the script absolutely puerile. It all felt like it was written by a high school kid, who's just heard a few things about Freud and wants to impress his friend with his newly acquired knowledge. I mean, there are actually lines like ""You Freud, have always sex in your mind. Why does everything always has to do with sex?""! Really? Mr Hampton, who are you writing this script for? Surely your target audience doesn't need things spell out so boldly and blatantly. It was like reading a checklist of all the possible clichés one could think about psychoanalysis (and Freud in particular). Who is this film for anyway? At times it felt like it was so ridiculously basic, as if it was written for people who have never even heard of Freud and Jung. Other times it was all so riddled with heavy handed quotes and so ""up its own self"" that it felt like watching some boring lecture given by an even more bored teacher, sitting on your old desk back in school. From such a renowned scriptwriter (he wrote Dangerous Liaisons and Atonement among the other things) I was expecting a lot more: maybe Mr Hampton should watch a few episodes of HBO's classy ""In Treatment"" to learn a thing of two about the subtlety of bringing psychoanalysis to the screen. As far as the two leading male actors (Fassbender and Mortensen, who by the way was so good in both Cronenberg ""A History of Violence"" and ""Eastern Promises""), they were as good as they could possibly be, but in the end they both failed to impress, move, or even raise any sort of emotion beyond boredom. But then again, that's hardly surprising given both the script they were actually given and a clear lack of any direction, which forced them to talk at each other in the most contrived scenes and badly staged, where even the extras in the background seemed fake and moved slowly and gently like ermwell, extras (particularly noticeable in the scene by the river).

109,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,6,30 January 2012,"This film is quite a disappointment. The topic is very fertile but Cronenbergapproached it very poorly. The relationship between Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is one of the biggest dramas in psychoanalysis or perhaps between the sciences related. More than the differences in opinion which caused several discussions (Freud didn't accept Jung's constant reference to religious aspects and Jung couldn't stand Freud's inflexibility, taking every single diagnosis to sexual fields), there's the actual psychoanalysis that David Cronenberg left to third layer, the first being the relationship between Jung and his patient Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) , which he kept in secret and also led to degradation in his relationship with Freud, the second layer. There are some verbal arguments between Jung and Freud or Spielrein, but all of them very distant and unrelated to the main story. My idea of Freud also differs from the one showed. Freud is supposed to be cold, arrogant and smart, showing great ability to explain scientific what's related the the subconscious.

112,paloma54,Unpleasant Characters & Uninteresting Story,3,18 July 2013,"Primarily I watched this movie to see what all the Michael Fassbender fuss was about, not because I am inherently interested in either Sigmund Freud or Carl Jung. The movie fails for me for several reasons, the chief of which is that the three main characters are somewhat repellent. Most disgusting to me is the disdain Jung and deranged paramour Keira Knightly (sorry, can't remember the character's name)show for the unselfish love which maintains and nurtures a monogamous marriage. I was especially disgusted at the scene which showed the two of them lounging in the sailboat which was so sweetly given to her husband as a gift by Mrs. Jung, who should receive the Enabler of the Century Oscar for continuing to bankroll such a dirtbag. All this championing of supposed human ""freedom"" is just a whole lot of self-worship without any consideration of others. I found it all rather nauseating, especially the unattractive mangy-looking Dr. Gross bragging about his sexual exploits. Now, on to my reactions to Keira Knightly. First off, I have never been a fan of hers. In my opinion, not only is she not all that pretty, but she flirts her way through every role with a simpering expression that assumes that everyone in the world is going to want to bed her. It's the cheap and obvious road to take for a female star, and she chooses it every time. I loathed her in Pride and Prejudice especially. The UK has oodles of actresses much better than KK. Her accent moves all over the map, sometimes sounding vaguely European, then English, sometimes American. Whatever, it was always inconsistent and odd. The jutting out chin is something she always has anyway, and in most roles she uses it to express romantic petulance. Ugh.Viggo Mortensen was the best thing about this film, in my opinion. I enjoyed him in Eastern Promises, a film which I enjoyed much more than I expected. Still, I can't say that this oh so earnest story has enough that is interesting to make it worth your while to watch Viggo's Sigmund playing with his cigar.

Michael Fassbender (Jung) and Viggo Mortensen (Freud) both performed seriously and insightful and Knightley captured pretty well the behavior of a hysteric person and then, her transition through therapy.The German locations where the filming took place were picturesque and the atmosphere was warm, theatrical, peaceful enough but rather slow at some points. The intense relationship between the Austrian neurologist and the Swiss psychiatrist was very interesting to watch nevertheless.The reason i enjoyed this film is simple: It was exactly what i was expecting it to be.

120,dalelawson-1,"Interesting insight into Freud and Jung's relationship, if a little un-plausible",7,24 February 2012,"It isn't often that someone describes a film as psychologically complex. Yet that is exactly the phrase I would use to describe A Dangerous Method (Dir. David Cronenberg, 2012). Throughout the film I was being fed theories developed by Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley). Many of said theories would go straight over my head, but I still left the film with a greater insight into the relationship between Freud and Jung, and of psychoanalysis' creation.People could be under the illusion that this film bares similarities to both The King's Speech and The Iron Lady. Thankfully, it doesn't. As I said in The Iron Lady review, there is nothing I hate more than a film swimming in the wake of another films popularity and success. In The Iron Lady's case that is the success of The King's Speech. A Dangerous Method's film makers have attempted to choose actors with a resemblance to their characters, but the film does not aim to force one to sympathise with the protagonist or supporting cast. This film simply, or not so simply in terms of the psychology theories, follows Jung as he strengthens and develops his own presumptions that contradict Freud's.Michael Fassbender is, in my opinion, a superb actor and a joy to watch on screen. In A Dangerous Method he was no different. He provided a strong protagonist for Keira Knightley to work alongside, as she portrayed the character of Sabina Spielrein, who begins the film as a patient to Jung and eventually becomes a psychologist herself. She, like Fassbender, has really been improving her acting range over the past few years after an unimpressive start to stardom with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. As Knightley's character is Russian, it is essential she put on an accent, which too me sounded plausible enough. She was also required to act psychologically scarred and does some very unnatural body movements throughout the film in reaction to pain and humiliation, these actions only strengthen the character of Spielrein.The final actor, that really deserved some sort of critical commendation for his role as Sigmund Freud, is Viggo Mortensen, who is recognisable to most as Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings trilogy. When Mortensen is on screen no-one can help but fall silent and slip into the illusion that Freud himself is explaining his psychoanalytical theories to us; which is fortified by his resemblance to Freud, courtesy of the make-up and costume departments. His performance was breathtaking, and for this reason alone people should really watch this film.I was unsure how truthful the narrative was to reality, as is always the case with movies ""inspired by true events"", which is one problem I had with this film. As at one point Freud remarks that he and Jung have been talking for 13 hours, but Jung had not been aware. I am unsure as to the validity of that conversation, and therefore other relationships and theories within A Dangerous Method are also questionable.The film also features two or three comical moments that provide a relaxing and refreshing break from the otherwise intense and complex drama.This film has breathtaking performances by Fassbender, Knightley and Mortensen; as well as pleasant visuals and an intricate narrative. The film did, however, have questionable areas and a story which became difficult to follow in the scenes of deep psychological debates. However I recommend this film simply on the basis of the incredible actors and superb soundtrack.

This movie will keep you hooked right up to the credits. I thought it ended slightly abruptly and was saddened to learn of Sabina's fate. As others have noted, this is one of those movies that could have stretched for over 2 hours and you'd still be wanting more. Well I would anyways...",A Dangerous Method
122,grayner-2,More than you may want to know about Freud and Jung,6,19 December 2011,"It is said that people don't want to know about the inner workings of sausage-making and politics. Perhaps the same could be said about the private lives of Freud and Jung, at least in this version. An ambitious and bold film but with an unsatisfying result.A Dangerous Method has many good points going for it. The cinematography is gorgeous. It explores the complex relationship between Jung and Freud and how their discussions shaped their work. It shows how profoundly their personal lives shaped their professional work. The film deserves kudos for presenting such a frank, unidealized portrayal of the two figures who were the very start of psycho-analysis. The acting, especially by Knightly, is excellent.But ultimately, you begin to ask yourself what the purpose of the whole thing is. Kind of like taking a bite of a sour lemon. You can do it but you may wonder why. The film shows Freud, Jung, Sabina Spielrein, Jung's wife and doctor/patient Otto Gross almost exclusively in terms of their interrelationships, with a special focus on Jung/Freud/Spielrein. Needless to say, the portrayals come off as highly unflattering on all sides: Freud - has reached a later stage in his career. Seems much more interested in honing his own legacy and being the king at the top of the movement he created than actually interested in helping real patients; Jung - Highly neurotic, twice engages in affairs with his patients, relishes being the authority/father figure for them, while showing little interest in his own family. Readily gives into his own sexual needs. Abandons personal ethics on relationships with patients early in the film on the advice of another patient; Spielrein - A woman with profound mental illness at the start of the film who later just has serious mental issues. Enjoys manipulating her doctor. Has no problem damaging the Freud/Jung relationship when it suits her on a personal level. Highly volatile and unstable, but becomes a doctor in her own right; Otto Gross - another doctor who is also a patient. Willingly manipulates his diagnosis with female patients to suit his sexual appetites; Mrs. Jung - A wimpy woman who makes mild protests about her husbands affairs but ultimately prefers to play dumb.As a result, you end up with a cast of characters you have little sympathy for. All seem more interested in patient maladies as an intellectual curiosity in their parlors than in helping real people with real diseases. It is a coterie of affluent folks analyzing each other. In keeping the focus so narrow on this group of people, Cronenberg neglects to mention the many successes Freud/Jung had in their careers. It all comes off some clinical, some intellectual masturbation instead of real-life solutions. I found myself hoping Freud could be embalmed, Jung would stop whining, Spielrein could be shipped off anywhere. It's a very interesting relationship but you really root for none of these characters as they are portrayed.Of course, Freud and Jung were the start of a movement. As with any new movement, there are false starts and what was considered revolutionary at one time can be considered incorrect or rudimentary at another, for example, the start of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980's compared to knowledge now. But ultimately, the film falls flat on several levels First, yes, it shows Freud and Jung in a different light but one that is quite negative in its frankness. You could make a film about some of the very negative qualities of Dostoevsky, Mother Theresa, George Washington and other pioneers in their field but ultimately it does not seem so rewarding. Second, one can argue that the film shows that everyone is infallible and the personal is inseparable from the professional, particularly those only at the start of a movement. But the fact is, the chemist, the poet, the political thinker ALL are greatly affected by their personal environments. That doesn't make the general theme of the movie, the lunatics running the asylum even better. No does it make Jung's personal lapses, in sleeping with patients with sexual issues, any more palpable. Third, it is not even that Jung, Spielrein, Gross all have some psychological problems themselves just to be therapists in their own right. Many pioneers in their field were deemed unfit to perform in a certain area: the pilgrims to the new world were considered unsavory figures in England, Einstein was a poor student. Perhaps we see so many petty and personal agendas here under the guise of helping the profoundly ill. Yes, we know it would lead to many new discoveries but it is still not appealing to watch it unfold.So when you get down to it, an interesting character study of interactions between pioneers at the start of a movement. But when you watch it, do you feel better about Freud and Jung and the nascent profession of psycho-analysis? No. Does it reinforce the often-repeated claims that Freud focused too much on sex, much of psychology could have been considered non-scientific, the work (particularly of Freud) was too much about finding patterns for theory sake and not about resolutions of problems? Yes.Two brilliant minds that you maybe don't want to see under such a big microscope.",A Dangerous Method
123,jegpad,Watching Knightley getting spanked ...,4,18 June 2012,"Perhaps it is just me, a female with a yawning boredom of sex depicted on screen and even less interested in the machinations of privileged men who in the early 20th Century saw women as secondary beings.But watching Keira Knightley getting spanked was not my idea of psychoanalysis other than to give her what she deserves for being such a hammy actress.Jung and Freud thought autism was caused by bad parenting, their only avenue to solution when sex could not be held accountable. Temple Grandin who suffered years of psychoanalysis (""put the 'o' in, it sounds better"" to quote Freud) can testify eloquently to that having found her own cure!",A Dangerous Method

125,mshackletonchavez,A Most Interesting Feature.,6,1 December 2018,"I was made curious by this motion picture, having not seen a David Cronenberg feature before, I watched with an open mind. And was, for the most part, pleased with what was delivered.This features strengths lay primarily in its topic and performances, most stellar by Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud. The phycological theme was made clear and centre in the feature, though at times it felt to be under explained just a tad.The cinematography was fairly standard, though the coloration was very vivid and bright, and truly sold the features location in the Alps and Vienna, and on the whole the cinematography did not detract from the film.I felt at times as though Keira Knightley's performance was exaggerated, I understand the difficultly of such a character, and the accent was unconvincing at times. On the whole I think this to be among her weaker performances, but it is not a bad performance, but a weaker one amongst the films others.Viggo Mortensen, was as always, a pleasure to watch. His presence in every moment of the film, I think to be the highlights of the feature; in particular his chemistry with Michael Fassbender, the father figure-son theme and the clashing of ideas. This gave some very stimulating and intriguing moments of characterisation, display their inner motives and world view.David Cronenberg's direction, though I can not compare or collate this to his other works, was a unique and memorable delivery. His style is highly distinctive, and gives the feature more character in a time when many films feel monostyalistic, to see a more unique take on direction was refreshing.Overall, I feel as if the screenplay did not deliver in its strengths enough: too much time spent on the sub-plot with Keira Knightly and the affair and less of the Freud/Jung conflict. And even the refreshment of Vincent Cassels interesting inclusion as Otto Gross didn't have about screen time or exploration.In the end, I feel as if this film could have been more great, it had grander potential, such as even exploring their works criticism, religious aspects and of course the Freud/Jung conflict of beliefs and ideas. But it is still an enjoyable and interesting feature, thus a 3/5, only slightly above the average film.",A Dangerous Method
126,jamesmartin1995,"Something missing, but still good.",7,16 August 2012,"When I heard that David Cronenberg was to make a film about Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and psychoanalysis, I was very excited, but didn't have a clue what to expect. Whatever it was, it certainly wasn't this.To say this is a turn-around for Cronenberg (the infamous 'Baron of Blood') would be an understatement. It certainly is dialogue orientated, and if it weren't for the stunning cinematography and period detail, you could certainly be forgiven for thinking that this was just a word for word screen adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play 'The Talking Cure' (incidentally, though, the playwright also wrote the screen play).What I found so strange is that the story Cronenberg has found is such an interesting and important one, and yet curiously, it is told with a bizarre lack of passion or dramatic intensity. Even the sex scenes are clinical and emotionally removed. I concede that this was undoubtedly an artistic decision made by Cronenberg, but I can't help feeling that it was something of an imprudent one. The result is alienating as opposed to compelling, which is what this movie should be.However, even a curious approach to the material cannot sink the interest it provokes just by being told. It is a truly great story, and the film, although slightly bloodless, is certainly handsome (of a picture postcard aesthetic) and well acted by Michael Fassbender (as Jung) and Viggo Mortensen (as Freud). I would normally stick up for Keira Knightley, as in my opinion, she's an incredibly gifted actress who gets an unfair press. Yet parts of her performance here, particularly towards the beginning of the film, left me ambivalent as to their merit.Can I recommend 'A Dangerous Method'? Certainly. It is a competent period drama with a fascinating subject (the best moments undoubtedly come from the scenes that Fassbender and Mortensen share), and it marks perhaps the biggest change in a director's film canon that we've seen for quite a while. Descriptions of dreams and the exploration of the relationship between Jung and Freud – two massive egos and incredible scientific minds – are the things to treasure here. On balance, this film is a little disappointing; but that only means that it is a good film instead of a great one!",A Dangerous Method
127,RokurotaMakabe,Perhaps a little too tame for a Cronenberg movie,5,19 November 2011,"""A Dangerous Method"" marks the third collaboration between director David Cronenberg and actor Viggo Mortensen and even though the final result is not as good as their previous two efforts, I found the film to be satisfying enough in the end. In terms of production values the film does not disappoint, but perhaps its main flaw is the storytelling. I really failed to get fully engaged in the story and even though the characters are developed well enough I was expecting more in terms of plot. This is an art-house film and it should be treated as such, but that does not mean that it should lack the entertainment factor. The fact that some of the viewers might fail to get emotionally involved might also have something to do with the film's pacing. Despite the fact that it has a running length of a little over an hour and a half the film moves perhaps a little too slow at times and some may find it to be overlong. The film probably lacks some of the shock elements that were present in Cronenberg's previous movies and made them unique. It does not have an element that stands out and this is where Cronenberg could have probably done a better job.There are also a lot of good things about the movie. For an instance, I really liked the great attention to detail when it comes to costumes and settings. On top of that it is beautifully shot and it has a good atmosphere.As far as acting goes Keira Knightley is definitely the weak link here, but the two male leads give noteworthy performances. Michael Fassbender is an actor with an incredible range and here he has the opportunity to show his acting abilities once more. As for Viggo Mortensen, I found his performance as Sigmund Freud to be more than satisfying.In spite of the problems it has, ""A Dangerous Method"" manages to be a decent addition to David Cronenberg's filmography. It only left me with the impression that it could have been so much better.My rating: 6,5/10",A Dangerous Method
128,a-ozornin,Great characters amazingly performed by stunning actors in remarkably short movie which jumps around the timeline,7,1 March 2012,"Sabina Spielrein, Russian with extreme psychological disorder, arrives at the clinic where young Carl Yung is working. This is the start of a difficult and intense relationship between Sabina, Yung and Sigmund Freud, which will enrich all of them and will give birth to psychoanalysis.I am a great fan of Keira Knightly, and I have been waiting for this movie since its release in September 2011 on the Venice Film Festival. Eventually, it arrived in Britain almost half a year later, and it was almost impossible to find it in the cinemas.The movie is an adaptation of the book ""A Most Dangerous Method"" by John Kerr, and it is a very poor adaptation. There are some movies adapted from the books that run smoothly, without considerable losses of cohesion or plot details. Just recall the last Harry Potter movie: despite pretty poor source, the movie itself is easy to watch and still interesting even for those who read the book several times.This is not the case with A Dangerous Method though. The storyline is patchy, it is sometimes possible to guess where the chapters of the book start and end. The film is overloaded with time skips; even in small amounts they could make the movie boring and hard to follow, never mind the amounts used in Dangerous Method.Also, one might wonder why to use those time skips so extensively anyway. The storyline is fantastic, it captures attention, it makes you interested throughout the film, and I was only begging for more: more details of characters, more events in between what was shown, simply more of the movie! But I was denied – the movie is pretty short at 99 minutes, and it is clear that authors scrambled to squeeze in everything possible at the price of development of the characters.The characters themselves are amazing. I don't know whether this is what they were at the time, but it is easy to believe so – they are coherent, interesting, smart individuals, and you see how the relationship between them affects their perceptions, beliefs and moral standards. I can only praise the work of Keira as Sabina, Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud and Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross. The latter had a pretty small role but he shined with perfection all the time he was on the screen. Mortensen played as over-confidently as I imagined the real Freud behaved; the gestures and posture were flawless.WATCH: If you plan to read the book; or simply want to know more about the pioneers of psychoanalysis.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",A Dangerous Method

These two were good friends at the beginning, but became adversaries in the end. Freud stood for a scientific approach to psychoanalysis and Jung for a metaphysical one. There is just one scene where the issue about this is being discussed without any conclusive result. Potentially an interesting ""fight"" the film doesn't dare to take in full and drowns in details. With characters of this caliber one should have expected to get a more interesting film, after all, these were the pioneers of modern psychology.

130,carter-47153,A Relationship of Maturity,8,24 August 2015,"Connection is a concept that is often overlooked as something that is necessary to a productive way of life. Not only can meaningful things be accomplished without help but a person needs human connection in order to thrive and be happy. Whether this is personal connection or done through online methods or letters; people yearn for connection. For some it is an absolute priority, they seek out as many friends and acquaintances that they can and for others they prefer a very small circle of friends. The common factor being people are happy when they have someone that they can talk with, and express ideas and most importantly feelings.In the film ""Deep Impact"", humanity as a whole is faced with the impending doom of a comet colliding with the Earth destroying all life. While the world's governments attempt various plans to stop the comet they all fail until a small group of people are able to sacrifice themselves for the rest of Earth. While at the same time the remaining main characters on Earth are able to find reconciliation among various emotional differences with other people in order to find happiness.This is no coincidence. The title may not refer to the impact of the comet into the Earth but rather that we have deep impact amongst others in our lives. This ranges from all forms of relationship types to at times people that we haven't met. The film encourages the ideas of the importance of art and culture within our society, as well as the meaningfulness of the individual.

If the viewer doesn't have a particular arcane interest in these century old dead on arrival ideas, there is nothing here to see. Most of this film might have some historical basis-but there is no way of knowing. The only evidence about these multitudinous conversations are later self serving statements from people none too trustworthy. Both Freud and Jung were notorious self promoters and each told some whoppers.The story hook is supposed to be: here is insight into the origins of pychoanalysis. This isn't really done. The protagonists talk at one another, but the ideas don't progress much. The ideas themselves have long since been shown to be pseudoscience and tossed away. Jung, who was described in an ""afterward"" note as ""The world's greatest psychologist', was neither great nor even a psychologist. His writing is sufficiently muddled and meandering that it gives some cultists a chance to project whatever they want into his inchoate ideas.Sabina Spielrein was described in the afterward as having trained the USSR's most prominet psychoanalysts. Huh? Since psychoanalysis was banned in the USSR for most of the years she lived there and about 30 years after her death, this statement is ridiculous. Knightley's performance was good but she didn't have much to work with. Her hysteria quickly grew tedious (as do real histrionic behaviors) and it wasn't long before she, too, got into the Yadda-yadda contests.Scenery nice.

Long Live Kronenberg!,6,8 September 2014,"As I sup my final can of the amber nectar I am better able to consider the positives and negatives of this movie by an old favourite Kronenberg. The first half hour was tortuous with Knightley's over the top acting, jutting out her chin and going on about how she enjoyed being sexually abused by her father. Then came the justification of casual sex by the Dr Gross character at which point Jung, played by Fassbender, becomes convinced that he should follow his instincts and have kinky sex with Knightley.What we see then is the relationship between Jung and Freud played by Mortensen, really badly in my opinion. Too many gruff hmmmms for my liking. I thought his portrayal of Freud was badly clichéd.The film is shot well enough but has a distinctly digital look about it, something I'll never get used to. The set design is clinical but not offensive.The film reminds me of what a female film critic said years ago about Cubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. She said that EWS was just a dirty old man's fantasy. Well, now that Cubrick has gone to the great studio in the sky I think Kronenberg is taking over the mantle of dirty old man because all his films from Crash onwards have just been full of pervy nonsense. Crash was at least a good movie to watch.No this offering from old Krony just lumbers on and while it's nowhere near as bad as Cosmopolis, I'm beginning to think that the sun is setting on the old guy. I had just watched The Fly the day before and I'm left scratching my head and thinking how it has come to this.I know that creatives don't want to stand still, they want to move on and grow creatively, but at the same time, it needs to be understood by said creatives that they are there to create entertaining material and by checking the box office receipts for this very average flick, it would appear most agree with me, this movie ain't very creative.I think another problem is that old Krony is working with the same people all the time. Same actors, same DP, same musicican. That's why his movies are jaded. How can you grow creatively when you standardize the creative process?

He is a hero to me and a proud part of Canada's film history, which is why it hurts so much to say this was a bad movie. I almost left during the first few minutes because of Kiera Knightley's ""acting"" if acting entails jutting out your jaw like a chimpanzee. One of the biggest problems I had with it though was the film's similarity to the vastly superior Dead Ringers (also based on a true story): two doctors who are very close are torn apart by a female masochist with severe mental issues who teaches them more about themselves then you would expect then proceeds to completely destroy them when they threaten to and/or leave her whilst she sides with one or the other and permanently drives them apart. I do believe that there is one shot that is exactly the same in the two films where (Knightley/Bujold) is beaten with a belt hands tied to the headboard by (Fassbender/Irons) and the shot is taken from a reflection in the mirror. The most interesting character was Cassel's so it is a shame that he plays no larger role. The story also covers a vast amount of time but feels too long in some places and not long enough in others.

Jung and later defender of Freuds psychology. Not only had their symptoms believable, her trembling and stuttering, but also the desire to achieve their self - and where would it better to find his development as a researcher of the unconscious, which is to become itself over time.C.G. Jung on the other hand is playing a role in running the contrary: first as an almost arrogant doctor and authority that seem to understand his patients but by the times develops doubts in his own skills. This culminates until such time as he falls victim to the desires of his patient and her ""dark desires"" surrenders. Young throws all of his ideas and dogmas of psychoanalysis itself, and therefore falls deeper and deeper into his own unconscious world that needs bringing to the fore, which was to do this renowned analyst is not aware of.Finally on this triad are missing the main character, around which all the doctrine of conscious and unconscious: Sigmund Freud - here played by Vigor Mortinson. Like the other two play along with Freud also goes through a transformation in the film - from research-based teacher back to the orthodox advocate a science that should make no more new discoveries, but only the captured defending. Comes as a friend orthodoxy advanced far is it to break with Jung: This looks to psychoanalysis Freud came to a point, realize that it no longer allows further developments. To whom does this break has now dealt a fatal blow, Jung or Freud is not apparent. Suffering at least do both at this break.My rating is a result of this incredibly exciting and rarely probed, and not very convincingly last played Anna S, a very good 9/10.

136,Tucch,Worst story focus in history.,4,25 November 2018,"I won't say much. This film deserves no more of my time.They gave German Psychiatrist Carl Jung a complete British accent, even though in reality he spoke with a thick German accent, and even worse, they had Michael Fassbender play Jung, an actor fluent in German, and they never used this to their advantage or to add to realism once.Kiera Knightly plays a mash up of about 20 different accents, in the beginning you will be forgiven for thinking she's from America (New York specifically) although this changes to Knightlys impression of a Russian/Jewish/German/USA blend throughout. Very odd casting choice.As far as, costumes, makeup, locations, sets & cinematography go, this is a 9/10 - 10/10 movie. To be honest, It's due to the above points raised that it manages to retain any score above a 2/10.Where this movie truly crashes and burns is the story focus, the Kiera Knightly episode never ends, literally 5 minutes will not go by where they cut from a scene that's starting to become interesting in its debate, to cut to more Knightly madness.There's so much more I can say, I could speak about what's wrong with this movie all day. But I seriously cannot waste any more time on it.In summary it's a movie that looks great, is about characters you may have always had an interest in, includes actors you're probably huge fans of and a director with many accolades; it's just a shame that this is so far from being one of them.",A Dangerous Method
137,njs-55801,Great acting and beautiful production in this intelligent tale from early psychoanalysis,8,6 May 2015,"A DANGEROUS METHOD David Cronenberg moves from body horror to mental dangers in this intelligent and handsomely mounted production of a tale from the early history of psychiatry: the relationships between Sigmund Freud, played by Viggo Mortenson, Carl Jung, played by Michael Fassbender, and two of the forgotten people of early psychoanalysis, Sabine Speilrein, Keira Knightley, and Otto Gross, Vincent Cassel.The film imagines a love affair between Carl Jung and one of his patients, Sabine Spielrein, a woman who went on to become an important psychiatrist in her own right. Spielrein's case prompted Jung to contact Sigmund Freud in 1906 for insights into treating her, beginning the relationship between Jung and Freud which lasted until their split in 1914.Relationships are at the centre of the movie. As well as Spielrein and Jung, there are those between Jung and Freud, between Jung and his wife, between Spielrein and Freud, and, most subtly, between Jung and Otto Gross, sent to Jung by Freud for treatment but who ends up influencing Jung into a very different world-view, one which sends him straight into the arms of Sabine Spielrein and some very unorthodox treatment.The film begins with a burst of action as Sabine Spielrein is dumped at the Burgholzi clinic in Switzerland in 1904 and taken as a patient by the newly-qualified Dr Carl Jung. She was diagnosed by Jung as a psychotic hysteric and Keira Knightley's depiction of this state is pretty close to Jung's initial notes, using her own physicality to describe Spielrein's derangement. Her condition improves but that unstable, twitchy dimension is always there as Keira Knightley keeps her on the edge right to the end.Michael Fassbender plays Jung as the polar opposite of Spielrein. Jung is calm, good-natured, kindly, and thoroughly decent even when he's having his affair with her or falling out with Freud. There's an attractive, genuine quality in Fassbender that makes him the stable centre of the film.The other great relationship in the film is between Freud and Jung. Viggo Mortensen's Freud is obsessed with protecting psychoanalysis from its enemies, sizing up Jung as a potential successor yet careful to maintain his own status as head of the clan. There's a dry wit in his performance along with an honesty about Freud's less appealing side, such as his chagrin at Jung's wealthy wife that lets us see Freud as human, all too human - a great but difficult man caught up in the dilemma of looking for a crown prince then, when he finds one, driving him into exile.The arrival of Otto Gross propels the film forward and provides Jung with the impetus, or the excuse, to start an affair with Sabine Spielrein. Gross is the chaos factor, breaking the stalemate between Spielrein's desire for Jung and Jung's staid conservatism and professionalism. Vincent Cassel plays Otto Gross as neurotic, shallow, insightful and obsessive, going through one sexual experience after another in search of Experience, permanently unhappy. He rejected Freud's idea of repression as a necessity for civilised behaviour, insisting on the immediacy of experience as negating the need for analysis, and challenging Jung at every step to do the obvious thing and have an affair with Sabine. It's an intelligent portrayal by Cassel, emphasising the mental and emotional distance between himself and Freud and Jung and condemning their inability to help him or, in his opinion, themselves. When he climbs over a wall and heads off to his tragic fate, of poverty and death, he is walking away from the possibility of psychiatry itself.The urgency and sense of panic in his early horror classics are long gone for Cronenberg. A Dangerous Method has a slow, regular pace and some scenes have an almost painterly quality, aided by some great digital matte backgrounds. Scenes are carefully composed with soft focus around the edges of facial shots keeping our attention on the middle of the frame. Outdoor scenes have people slowly promenading in the background along riversides or in parks, adding life and motion and giving a depth to the world.Deep inside the end credits it says ""This film is based on true events, but certain scenes, especially those in the private sphere, are of a speculative nature"". The mix of fact and speculation has produced a consistent story thanks to Cronenberg's tight focus on characters who are brought to life by great actors in a film of pristine production values and beautiful music. In a way this mirrors the dangerous and optimistic offer of psychoanalysis: to mix the known and unknown in consciousness and produce a better, more consistent human being.",A Dangerous Method

139,Unbilled_Role,"Sincere Effort, But the Cake Was Left Out in the Rain",6,16 October 2011,"What was the source of conflict which caused a gulf to form between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung? When we examine their personal and professional lives, what turning points shaped their theories? What were the storms which blew through the lives of Jung and Sabina Spielrein? These are some of the questions this film attempts to highlight, and in fact begins to touch upon. Some of the most scintillating moments of ""A Dangerous Method"" are sexually bracing. But the audience is left feeling a bit orphaned. Do these carnal scenes truly address the significant thematic questions? Here's my main beef with this film: I wanted to see more time spent on the rigorous conflict between Freud and Jung. I have a sincere interest in the life of Carl Jung, but in the end, I was not sufficiently satisfied. Having said that, the production design, scenery, and costuming were absolutely wonderful.The somber, instinctual undercurrents of ""A Dangerous Method"" can be a bit hypnotic. But because the script suffers, I cannot fully come under its spell. As the rolling credits came up, I personally felt a bit deflated, as if a sweet was torn from my curious grasp. Although I think most films would do well with a tighter edit, this movie could have used an additional 30 minutes of character and plot development.I appreciated the qualities which Fassbender brought to Carl Jung. Vincent Cassel was right on the mark as the impulsive Otto Gross. Jung's insecure wife Emma was tenderly portrayed by Sarah Gadon. Although Keira Knightley tried her best to portray Sabina Spielrein, there were certain scenes where her delivery seemed pushed. I have long respected Viggo Mortensen, but I was not fully convinced by his affected portrayal of Freud. So, who would I cast as Sabina? Emily Mortimer, Helena Bonham Carter, or Rachel Weisz come to mind. And how about the part of Freud? Ben Kingsley, Dustin Hoffman, or Geoffrey Rush could have added a riveting twist to this role. Is there a doctor in the house? I will leave that for you to decide.",A Dangerous Method
140,PipsHeritage,Fascinating food for thought,9,19 March 2012,"If you are interested in the mysterious ways of the human mind, and like to look beyond of what the average person takes for ""right"", ""wrong"" and/or ""true"", then you don't want to miss this film. Next to the beautiful, crisp, period costumes and sets, the dialog between Freud and Jung, and Jung and Spielrein make you rethink and -consider general accepted ""truths"". How easy are we made to think a certain way, just because it is generally the most accepted point of view. How many of us dare to take the trouble, the effort to think things over a bit deeper? For instance: What does that certain restlessness in the corner of your mind tell you? Should you ignore it? Or should you have the courage to explore and evolve that neglected part of yourself that you decided to tuck away? Some of us choose to take the easy route; nice and smooth, comfortable, but in the end get stuck in a certain shallowness. Shallow is safe, shallow is uncomplicated. But then there it comes again, that little voice, that inner turmoil. If you decide not to listen to it, the price you pay is that you get stuck in a state of averageness, parts of your personality being left undeveloped, unexplored. And you might sail through life smoothly, but you never reach your full potential, because you didn't have the guts to face your true, inner, authentic self. Now that I have seen a new part of Michael Fassbender's talent, I have become a huge fan of his art. I love actors with courage in their profession, who dare to turn themselves inside out, to transform, not take the easy way in and out. True art can hurt, can be painful and confronting psychologically. But that is also the fascinating part about acting. And it is immensely gratifying in the end if you have the ambition to grow in your profession. I do have to watch this film on DVD again so I can put the film on 'pause' and 'rewind' to think over what just has been said and really take things in. It is not an easy film, not everybody will get it right away. And too bad that psychoanalysis is out of style, because I believe that hours long talk-therapy works best when you don't have to look into the piercing eyes of your therapist, which is very distracting from what you have to say. There is a certain hypnotic effect in staring at the ceiling, or closing your eyes, which brings you to the core of your inner turmoil. But, it is too expensive these days. And that is really too bad. I gave it 9 instead of 10 stars because I thought Keira Knightley acted her insanity too over-the-top, too melodramatic. It made me think more of someone spastic or epileptic, than the woman with a nervous breakdown she meant to be. Like she said, she wasn't crazy. Why else did she turn out to be such a genius in the psychoanalytic field.",A Dangerous Method
141,zaciogeribello,"Take your time, this is a Masterpiece.",9,16 February 2012,"Maybe Freud's character in this movie could be extended and more complex. Instead, it was brief, but precise. Jung's character could go all the 360 degrees round. Again, it didn't. It was a round one, though, and very objective, according to the project of the film. The title and the promotion would also suggest a more intensely and focused plot in this two main characters, but it didn't, because Sabina Spielrein kind of ends up dominating the story. She turns out to be a key for practically all threads in this plot. At last, A Dangerous Method would presumably put Psychoanalysis at the center of its development, but Cronemberg's perspective went a little further and brought us this unrest feeling of existence, the ""spleen"" (Baudelaire), ""la nausea"" (Nietzche and Sartre), an atmosphere that pretty much reflects Cronemberg's main approaches. Eventually, then, it's a genuine Cronemberg's movie, and it's a very special one.No wonder that we feel sometimes sharply uncomfortable, tedious and teased by a bit of anxiety or anguish, that's exactly what the movie is about. It comes from the doubts and discomfort with life and sickness, surrounding everyone, while telling the story of Psychoanalysis. Not even Freud is safe, in several aspects of his life, work, friends, patients and theory. They have so many limitations, they make mistakes, they are in the center of a storm, which is the human mind, the human soul, living in a world that is about to explode (WW1, totalitarianism, WW2...) and is still highly dominate by the figure of the father, an authority above all, in a very repressive, paternalistic and male society.In that world, Sabina Spielrein could not be adjusted and healthy, but, before her 20's, she got extremely hysterical, if that is possible. She was brought to a psychiatric institution by her family, where Jung worked and was waiting for an opportunity to apply Freud's new method. Jung also wanted a chance to get to know him personally. That was when Psychoanalysis really began, by going beyond Freud's patients only, and through the discussions among the three of them, that are very brief but give a good idea of what did happen. The world, nevertheless, wasn't ready to accept or to collaborate very well with this new method.The problematic relation between therapist and patient, the several forms of resistance, the transference that occurs and makes the patient take the therapist as an object of his hopes, interests, emotions, and all of this through the ""innocence"" of a talking cure. This gap between, first place, the real world and the special world that is recreated within the therapy, and secondly, between the individuality of therapist and the patient, between their real lives and the special relation that is produced during Psychoanalysis, that was the biggest challenge in the effort to heal neurosis. Still is. Where is the masterpiece, then? It's in Sabina Spielrein. Vigorously played by the young Keira Knightley, way further than wherever she had gone before that. Sabina Spielrein is a profound tragic character, in a play that works entirely to show this, her unfitness to the world, but in a sense that it becomes our unfitness. Her tragic experience becomes universal, in this story. It's our tragedy, the tragedy of existence. Sabina couldn't be balanced, ""normal"", controllable, adjusted, tepid, but she had to be unquiet, sometimes disturbed.It's not a movie that you should see unprepared, that you watch and quickly make up you mind as you leave the theater or turn off the DVD: liked it, didn't like it, and that's all. It needs time to understand a little bit more of what was shown in this very meticulous work. Watch it again, read some reviews, and soon you'll probably figure that out. You've just seen a true masterpiece of Cronenberg, Mortensen, Fassbender, Keira and everyone else that took part in it. You will smile at last.",A Dangerous Method

It was quite boring. It's always distracting when a movie takes place in another country and the actors are speaking English, especially in the wrong accents. It's not possible to make this type of film too exciting, I get that, but I think they could have done a little better. I was watching with someone else and felt guilty the whole time for making them sit through the film. However, it's educational if you study psychology or have an interest in it. It seems even the psychologists have problems but despite all that, Jung still had some very interesting ideas.

I also think Eastern Promises showed what happens when a great Director pairs with an awesome muse. I anticipated this film eagerly but after watching it I was left with mixed feelings. Perhaps this is because the script was not as tight as that of the first two films I mentioned. It was never going to be easy capturing something as abstract as psychoanalysis on film, yet I can say that this film does ramble on at times and it is slow. A History of Violence was slow but the pay off was fantastic. Here there was no pay off. We were shown the lives of three great, complicated minds and that was it. After reading about the lives of the three central characters I can safely say that perhaps this was not the film Cronenberg should have made about Freud. He opted respectfully for the less dramatic and more factual and I think this sacrifice could have hurt what could have been another Cronenberg/Mortensen smash-hit. That said, I also think Keira Knightley was a mis-cast and Mortensen and Fassbender were as perfect as ever. Looking forward to the next Cronenberg flick. This wasn't awful but I expected more.",A Dangerous Method
144,Mahan18,Meh,5,12 May 2012,"Yeah, not all that impressed with this movie. I don't get it, Cronenberg is an awesome director with a very impressive filmography, but this is definitely one of his weakest, if not THE weakest.The acting is... okay, for the most part. After all, we have some good actors here... that is, until they talk to one another. When they are left to themselves, they do a decent enough job, but the chemistry between the characters is extremely lacking, and considering how the movie is hinged on the chemistry between Freud and Jung, that is a big problem. It is given to us as something major, as history has shown, but the final separation between these two minds is not given the full gravitas it would need to pull it off.The ideas presented to us are, for the most part, interesting, but aren't put forward in an interesting way. We essentially have three psychiatrists/psychoanalysts bouncing off of each other, and yet the dialogue is quite bland and motionless. The dream analyses, I will admit, were actually quite interesting, but the theories that Jung had (while being described as being 'shamanistic') are barely shown to be such. We are given a few BRIEF showings of his theories, but only enough to make it look like a passing thought, not something that seemingly governed his way of analytical thinking.But my biggest problem with this movie: Keira Knightley. That painfully annoying and overtly Jewish accent of hers is really offputting, and constantly reminded me of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, and the idea of Westheimer having a conversation with Freud kept drawing me out of whatever drama was going on (what little of it there was). That, and her acting changed from psychotic to normal to middle of the road WAY too much to get a emotional grip on the character. That, and her sex scenes are so far removed from anything 'interesting', no matter which way you approach it, to the point that they appear to be nothing more than just checkpoints to make sure the audience hasn't fallen asleep.Oh, and Jung's wife: Completely pointless and could have been cut from the film completely without missing a beat.But, it isn't ALL bad. As I said, for the most part, the acting holds a firm footing, the ideas of Freud and Jung, overall, are given in a way that COULD make someone interested enough to look them up on their own... even though it shouldn't have to make them feel that way. It has enough potential to be a decent watch with the right mindset... just need to FIND the right mindset first.If you are interested in Freud and Jung's history, this is at least a decent starting point. I would recommend it to anyone in the psychiatric field or with a firmly grounded interest in the field, as they would probably get the most of this movie.

146,kkhannah,There's Something Missing Here...,6,13 December 2011,"I must admit, going into this film, I was rather excited; I've enjoyed both of David Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen's previous collaborations and my interest in both Freudian psychology/psychoanalysis and Michael Fassbender practically guaranteed that I would be seeing this film. I fear now, however, that my expectations may have been a bit too high. I must admit, however, that I thought that Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen played their roles very well, although Mortensen definitely didn't receive as much screen time as he deserved. Vincent Cassel definitely shone in his extended cameo as Otto Gross. I did have some issues with Keira Knightly's acting, however. I feel like she may have over exaggerated her actions, particularly in the beginning scenes where she is in the midst of hysteria.However, my real problem with this film is that, for lack of a better term, it all seems a little too shallow. Events that should be important are skimmed over and not explained; to be honest, it doesn't particularly seem like anything of real importance happens in the film. The characters have little depth; despite the fact that they are all playing rather well known persons, there simply isn't anything to them other than a name. On top of this, despite what the taglines of the film and trailer seem to suggest, the relationship between Freud and Jung is hardly explored. For the most part, their scenes involve reading letters from the other. This is hardly compelling viewing. Overall, I feel like this film would have been better if it had been longer. If the film had a running time of even two hours, compared to one and a half, more character development could have been inserted, particularly for Freud. In addition, more focus on Jung's relationship with Freud, rather than his relationship with Spielrein, would have been nice to see. Here's hoping that any future collaborations between Cronenberg and Mortensen pack a bit more of a punch.",A Dangerous Method
147,alex703,"Wish it had been more ""Dangerous""",5,25 November 2011,"I must first say that I am unfamiliar with the works of Freud and Jung and am simply judging this based on its merit as a movie. I hope that doesn't affect my review too much.To me, this movie was split into to halves. The first was ambitious, attempting to tackle the question of how far psychotherapy could and should go, about repressing one's desires, about professionalism and love. It failed in many ways to do this.First of all, Keira Knightly's sub-par performance as Carl Jung's first patient with whom he uses the new ""method"" is distracting to the point of being a detriment to the story. Not only did Knightly sound like she was struggling with the accent, but she seemed to reduce acting to a series of strained facial expressions. In addition, the temporal spacing of the movie was choppy, and the fact that there was no process to ""curing"" her shown left the viewer not caring when she and Fassbender got into their dalliance later.However, there were some good things, with the notable Vincent Cassel doing in 10 minutes what the movie was struggling to do for the first 40. He effectively brings a fresh perspective to psychoanalysis while still being more than a bit crazy himself, causing Jung to question himself and his beliefs. However, Cassel's exit was abrupt and unwelcome.The second half of the movie took a much simpler route, choosing to show the frustration that Jung feels at Freud, played smarmily by Viggo Mortensen. In many ways this succeeds.The narrative comes together at this point, and with Knightly no longer acting crazy, there was less of a distraction. The divide between the two great psychoanalysts widens, stories are revealed, drama ensues. This portion of the movie is handled fine, but it is much more conventional and has lower aims.Overall, I feel that Cronenberg and co. felt that they needed more of a narrative to keep the drama go, but I wish they had continued to pursue the more existential questions that it appeared they were going to. There is a distinct lack of self-reflection from Fassbender in the second half of the movie, the part where he is supposed to be questioning himself and his beliefs. His conflict with Freud also seemed a bit trite, with the dialogue coming off a bit contrived.The movie also tries to portray Freud as this grand master of psychoanalysis who is now unwilling to pass the torch, but never really presents any of his discoveries. from the beginning, he makes race an issue and talks about his ""enemies"" more than his theories, so there is really no good quality to latch onto. It would have been harrowing to have seen the bird falling from its perch; instead, we just want the dick, who is a dick throughout to movie, not to get his way.Anyway, it is a fun movie which asks some real questions, at least for a bit. Greatly flawed, but still greatly intriguing. Go see it.",A Dangerous Method
148,imzadi001,"A snapshot of the life of Jung, watched over by the shadow of Freud",8,28 April 2012,"Here we see a fine example of the intuitive process of Carl Gustav Jung's working psychological theories and what events may have influenced him in certain directions, namely the relationship of passion, as opposed to necessity, governed more than likely by his own unconscious compensatory outlet.The acting in this film is absolutely sensational from beginning to end. All the actors do an amazing job of portraying these historical characters with a vitality that translates their essence to the figures they portray.Bear in mind though, this is merely a snapshot of the life and character of the great Carl Gustav Jung, it is not a profound biographical piece, but instead captures an event which spans several years in the early 1900s (namely his relationship with patient and colleague Sabina Spielrein. There is much much more to Carl Jung than portrayed here, so anyone seeking that level of expository needs to pick up his autobiography 'memories, dreams, reflections'.This is a snapshot really, and a psychological aid for those who wish to witness in a pictorial format what exactly led Jung to the formation of the more intuitive side of his approach to psychological theory and psycho-analysis.The presence of Sigmund Freud here (played by Viggo Mortensen) is quite formidable in its over-shadowing significance, and reveals the other impetus behind Jung's move into a more intuitive direction.My only gripe is that I felt the film could have been a little longer, and the point at which it ended sort of felt like mid-stride. It could have been an excellent 2+ hour work. Instead it is a very good one hour and thirty minute movie.",A Dangerous Method
149,globewarmer,A most peculiar title,5,7 April 2015,"Having watched this film, which is beautifully dressed, acted with some competence, and with sets and scenes bright with seeming authenticity, and with my life spent in psychology and with some of that time spent around psychotherapy and analysis, I am loath to spend this time without writing something here.I knew, of course, that Freud and Jung broke their relationship, but the existence of Frau Spielrein was news to me; I understand the root inspiration of this film is a book by John Kerr, A Most Dangerous Method, published in 1994, where recently discovered papers by that lady were used to unpack the conflict between the 2 psychotherapists. I now understand, from some background reading, that her ideas of the Eros/Thanatos link were seminal to Freud's theories. Somewhere, presumably, in Kerr's book is the explanation for the title's use of 'dangerous'. I didn't hear the word mentioned in the film, and don't understand the reason for its use.After all, as Spielrein herself admits, Jung (using Freud's technique) cured her of her hysteria, and helped put her on the road to qualifying as a doctor. As Jung admits, she was the love of his life. The method then wasn't dangerous to either of them, though it may have been tumultuous.Freud doesn't say anything about psychoanalysis being dangerous, merely that it is about truth. So why 'dangerous'? New, unexpected, reviled, idealized - all those, yes. Dangerous, no. Perhaps it just helped sell the book and the film too.The film, on this site, is hugely praised and hugely panned by different reviewers, but I belong with those who feel rather apathetic, uninspired and mostly uninformed by the script. Rather bemused, really, though I think it may grow on me with a second viewing. Viggo Mortensen was the surprise, who looked rather a lot like the young Freud did look, and who played his part in a very downbeat fashion. He was marvellous as usual. As for the rest, I can only say, at this point, meh!",A Dangerous Method
150,laminur,Didn't like very much,5,5 December 2011,"I saw the film yesterday. While watching the film, I continuously kept thinking if those were really happened. That is, Dr. Jung did really like that kind of sex? I have read many books on Jung, Freud, etc, when I was younger but I don't know such characteristic about Jung. Anyway.. First of all, the film is not about the birth of psychoanalysis, just it seems to be. The film is about the disturbing relationship of Jung with Sabin. For me that's it. This relationship is disturbing I don't enter the details of course here. The film contains some interaction between Jung with Freud also, yes some; I would really prefer if the films would have focused on the birth of psychoanalysis. That means the treatments of Freud, his patients,... But, the film -for me- is on Dr. Jung.Therefore, I don't find the name of the movie correct. Besides his affair with Sabin there are other unlikable points in Jung also. Are those real I don't know; for example Otto's impression on him. In addition, I didn't like Keira Knightley. It is the fist time I watched her. OK, the character she plays is disturbing but I agree some ideas in forum pages, a different actress could have been played more successfully. Also, we cannot witness the transformation of that sick woman to a physician too; how did she have been cured??? What applied to her??? the film did not show those... We cannot see the ""method"", the psychoanalytic treatment. Just a few talk between her and Jung... I should repeat: I don't find the name of the movie correct. Besides that name and the film content inconsistency would be dangerous in the sense that people not knowing psychoanalytic therapy can believe that this ""method"" is related with that kind of sex!!

151,iljones,Brilliant and disturbing psychological docu-drama,9,10 February 2012,"I went in to this film with few expectations, although I have enjoyed some of Cronenberg's previous work (e.g., Eastern Promises) for its intensity and often over-the-top dramatic content. By the end of this picture I had decided that this is certainly one of Cronenberg's best works – a deep, well-constructed, thought-provoking and often disturbing film examining both the origins of psychoanalysis as well as the intellectual and personal issues of the characters. The film is not a romantic drama or even a biopic designed to please and entertain the viewer – it is more of a thinking person's documentary focused on these pioneering psychologists. I suspect that many of the reviewers here who are not impressed by the film may have approached it with expectations that it would be either a colourful romantic period piece, another of Cronenberg's dark and violent dramas, or a fawning biopic of celebrity mystic Carl Jung – it is none of these. The film presents its story in an extremely level fashion with fast-moving and detailed scenes and dialogue and that never condescend to the viewer – you really have to know something beforehand about 19th century psychology history and the main characters to 'get it'. It is thus a rare film these days in its decision to not dumb-down its rather complex subject. Cronenberg's film also does not shy away from subtly exposing the irrational and illogical aspects of both the characters and their profession - another positive point in my opinion. Michael Fassbender is outstanding as Jung and seems especially good at conveying the character's internal conflict and intellectual confusion with facial expression and body language as much as dialogue. Viggo Mortensen is very good as Freud but clearly the focus of the film is Jung so his Freud doesn't get as many good lines. I am not a fan of Kiera Knightley and for about a minute I was thinking she was miss-cast for the role and over-acting. However, once the extreme personality of her character became apparent I had to concede that Ms. Knightley was exhibiting nothing short of brilliance in her portrayal of Sabina Spielrein. Her's is a very disturbed and disturbing character that never allows you to be at ease when she is present in a scene – the discomfort of watching her was to me the evidence of the success of her acting and the cleverness of the decision to cast her in the part. Vincent Cassel is as usual brilliant as Otto Gross, a darkly comic character, psychoanalyst and mental patient who moves Jung. Like the Spielrein character, the film itself is both difficult and disturbing to watch at times, but it goes to the basics of human behaviour and the complex nature of its characters – it leaves one thinking about these issues for days after viewing. This is not a film I would want to watch again and again, but it should be seen once, especially by those interested in psychology. Thank you Mr. Cronenberg.",A Dangerous Method

It wasn't to be so I left disappointed. It lacked a plot and it was flat. Movies are not a book club. They need a story with twists and turns through which you discuss the underlying narratives of the subject. They need a story to engage you both emotionally and intellectually.Dangerous method at times felt like a documentary on psychoanalysis particularly during the soulless moments of letters reading, at times it felt it was all about the costumes, the setting and the reconstruction of the turn of the century Zurich and Vienna and at times it felt like a mainstream movie with brief sex scenes to spice up the story. It failed to successfully engage on any of the themes it tackled, be it the issue of psychoanalysis, of sadomasochism, the transition to modernity and of women liberation.There were good moments though which made the movie worth watching; the fabulous reconstruction of the turn of the century central European bourgeoisie, Michael Fassbender was wonderful as Young, the symbolism for women liberation with Keira Knightley arriving with a horse-driven stage coach at the beginning of the movie and departing with an early motorcar at the end.But overall less of a dangerous method and more of a missed opportunity.",A Dangerous Method

This role was a 360 from his amazing role in ""Shame"".The only thing I can say about Viggo Mortensen as Freud is that he didn't have to do much to fulfil this role.

Where i find the movie failed a bit is the story where the connections in the scenes are bit off. I got the feeling that it was jumping trough periods without any connection which i could put together. It seemed like there were years in gaps between couple of scenes where there wasn't any. Even if this followed only true life events of Jung and Freud it still leaves us with wanting more then just few dialogs and scratch on the surface of psychology treatments. Kinsey (2004) is a movie which is a good parallel example how a movie about similar subject can be and can be done brilliantly. Maybe movies about lives of both Jung and Freud are in order.

No.,7,7 May 2015,"This review is pretty hard to write, because there is so much in this film that I enjoyed, and so much that I nearly cringed at. Cronenberg has been a master of taking complex psychological themes and giving them terrifying conclusions, while making powerful statements on modern society. And he has set the bar very high. The marriage of the director and a film on the origins of psychoanalysis could've been a match made in Heaven, but the film tries to deal with too much, without focussing on one single storyline, and not being able to do justice to any one of them.The film starts off with Sabina Spielrein and Carl Jung's first conversations while she was suffering from hysteria, and their relationship develops into a sexual one. While Carl Jung helps her develop her career in psychology, he finds fulfilment in her company. This storyline starts with much potential, but meanders to a halt. The most enjoyable parts of the film were obviously the interactions between Jung and Freud. Michael Fassbender's performance was genuine and passionate. And what can I say about Viggo Mortensen - it felt as if Sigmund Freud himself had time travelled to act in this film. This film captures beautifully how these two men feel an emotional affinity to each other, but have different ideas about psychoanalysis, which makes them constantly size each other up, consequently creating a rift between them. I felt that they deserved more screen time together and their interactions should have occupied the foreground.The Jung-Spielrein storyline suffers from Jung mostly feeling guilty about cheating on his wife, and scenes with his wife in them seem quite unnecessary. I like Keira Knightley in a lot of her films, but she was miscast in this one. Her performance was shockingly bad and restricted me from getting immersed in the film and the characters. Instead, I was fully aware of watching someone act, and act badly. Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross makes a big impact in a small role. He has some controversial views on sexuality and eventually plays the serpent to Jung's Adam. While this film could've been a roller coaster ride of emotional, professional, sexual and psychological conflicts, it stays snuggled comfortably in between.",A Dangerous Method
158,sarahlotfyb,why is this movie made?,5,24 March 2020,"I watched the full movie, but I still didn't get the purpose of it!
Why was this movie made? was it just to attract watchers as it's about Carl Jung and Segment Freud? Or it's to give the watchers hints to let them research more about the dangerous theory? Is it normal for me as a watcher to finish the movie asking myself why did I watch this?!
When I finished I thought that there must be something wrong and I had to read many reviews and articles about the movie to make sure that I know what's going on with this movie. But I found out that many people have the same opinion as me.
I'm so upset that the movie didn't focus more on Carl and Segment's lives because they are why people want to watch the movie! and instead of showing Carl as a cheater or as an insane person sometimes, they could've shown us what happened later during the second world war or maybe they could've explained to the watchers more about the dangerous theory or Carl's or Segmet's opinions and lives... Again I keep saying that maybe the movie is just to give us hints so we start to question more and research to get the information or something.
OR maybe the movie is to show us how great people like Carl Jung did wrong things from the perspective of the society or religion but that didn't stop them from being great at the end.What was so good about the movie is the colors of every scene, every scene looks like a painting. not only colors but the videography and the shots of it.
And the actors are very very good!
The movie is so artistic.. I could say it's a piece of art.
Of course, after watching it I'll read more bout the characters in it and I'm getting to know more about the Spycholoanalysis that Segment Freud came out with, which Carl was using with his lady patient in the movie.The movie could have been so much better from my point of view.",A Dangerous Method

Keira Knightley gives a good performance. Photography is OK, too.But then the film never takes off for the following reasons. The camera is static most of the time. The film shows intensive moments of nevrosis or anxiety in a single shot that the director may have though is good enough. The music is lacking, it never enters the show, never becomes part of it. The editing department is not so talented. Scenes are cut without even trying to recover the director's poor choice of shooting long scenes with a single camera. These two departments, director and editing, are the key to understand why this movie comes apart to create some nice shooting without a filmic story. So thumbs down for the director and thumbs up for the actors, costumes and photography depts.I don't know Cornenberg, but the potential of this movie was huge. It is unforgivable that nobody in the producing line didn't understand that the movie is never taking off, it needs more shots, more details, better editing, dolly camera, etc. Not to speak about it's end which doesn't make any sense artistically. Fade off and good bye. No logic expectation why it should end there, no history concluded, nothing. Just fade off and write out when did the characters die. This is far from making this a movie, and near to making it a theater show with static cameras and good acting.",A Dangerous Method

I suppose one might have guessed, thought, believed she was over-acting. I watched this film with a psychiatrist friend who said he has a patient EXACTLY LIKE THIS. Meaning: Keira's performance was spot-on. Knightly is moving and the depiction of a madly hysterical, disturbed person as very visceral, and quite disturbing. But then again- HYSTERIA IS DISTURBING. My favorite scenes in this movie are Jung and the newly cured Speilrein are seated afar from the river and Speilrein (Knightley) gives young a rather forward advance indicating that if Jung (Michael Fassbender) should ever decide to act upon their close relationship he can find her ""up there"" (pointing to her apartment. And then another favorite scene is when Jung (Fassbender) hires Speilrein (Knightley) to work assisting in his research. Unbeknownst to Speilrein, she is recording data in an interview of Jung's wife.",A Dangerous Method

Firstly, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is a slow burner and very dialogue heavy but there is a sense of these real figures. Many non fiction adaptations don't leave you with a true reflection. It is good an elegant cinematography and the acting is superb.The settings were beautiful and I enjoyed wallowing in that. Besides, I have never been a fan of Knightley but she is believable and to see her development whilst Fassbender descends into breakdown is very intriguing. Secondly, as for Viggo, I was not sure he would be a good fit but the shrewd, assured and knowledgeable aspect is apparent and frankly accurate of Freud. Certainly not for everyone but well shot, excellent script, and clever interplay and reactions between the actors gave this a sense of real life, psychology and society at this time for me.

Everyone screwing around with everyone..then finding a way to justify it inside their own crazy heads? Are all shrinks as nutty as this movie indicates?

164,necromancer-cm,Stunning and Controversial,9,25 February 2012,"I have just started a course in Psychology and was thrilled to hear that a movie was made on the life of Freud and Jung. Keeping up-to-date with the dates and actors etcetera, I greeted the choice of Viggo Mortensen as actor for Freud with great enthusiasm as I have found much content in his work in the acting business. The choice of Michael Fassbender & Keira Knightely greatly enthused me as well. When I heard that the movie was coming out I was overjoyed a rushed to see it and when I saw that it only had a 6.8 score, I was horrified. Whoever gave such an excellent movie a score such as this obviously had no love or enthusiasm for the field of Psychoanalysis, which I find this movie gives an epic and accurate portrayal of. If commenting on the film as a whole then I could not complain in the slightest but there are a few tweaks that could have been done; for instance, Miss Knightely seems to jut out her jaw when having psychological attacks, this is extremely un-becoming and she seems to have gone to much out of her way to impress the critics that so openly abused her and her contribution to the acting community. I believe however that Miss Knightely proved within her role that she is an actor of an extremely high calibre and should be treated as such; I take my hat off to the wonderful accent! Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Freud could not be better and I believe that the director made a wonderful choice when he allowed him to play such a revered character, he has just gone from strength to strength having out done himself in his portrayal of The Man in The Road. The relationship and intimate connection between these three actors, within this movie (Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen especially) made this movie unbelievably watchable, I give my thanks to the actors, but especially David Cronenburg for his ""oh-so"" accurate portrayal of these legends lives and their legacy.",A Dangerous Method

171,ciccowski-672-640848,"Slow romantic drama, not about Jung or psychology at all.",1,6 March 2012,"This was the most disappointing movie of the year for me. I'm a big fan of Jung and his work in psychology, I have read all his books, and I also like a couple of Cronenberg movies too, so you can imagine my expectations. I was expecting this movie to be about Jungian psychology, about the difference with Freudian psychology, and about their relationship with Sabina which was very intense. This movie turned out to be a generic romantic drama (very slow one) about a man and a woman. The fact that the characters were Jung and Sabina had no implications whatsoever. Actually the characters could have been...I don't know...Sean and Julie, whoever, and there wouldn't be any difference. This is because Jung wasn't portrayed or developed at all as the psychiatrist he was, nor was Sabina nor Freud. They were just regular people using those names. The characters were not developed, they were just interacting in this love affair in a very superficial way. The few moments of the movie where you can see Freud and Jung discussing psychology (talking about the libido, about Junguian concepts, etc) they are unexplained and they feel totally out of place, because the movie is not about that, it's just about the love affair between this man and this woman. Completely generic and shallow. Sabina's character disappears at one point, then she returns but they don't tell you what happened with her. You're watching a romantic movie and suddenly the girl disappears, the 2 men have a conversation that had nothing to do with anything and then Sabina returns (cured? who knows!). It's a mess. Now, about Keira Knightley, I think she's fantastic, but in this movie her performance was overacted and forced, you can tell at some points of the story she doesn't know if act crazy or normal. I think the actors were just as lost as I was, they didn't know what to do because the characters were not defined at all. They didn't know who they were portraying, I mean they sure knew who Jung and Freud are, but this characters were not them, they were just people who acted weird.

You don't have to be a genius to suppose this mass-oriented picture would most possibly evolve around sex and never show a viewer other sides of Freud's innovative work. But who knew it would end up being about aping Keira Knightley and soapy relationships. The narrow way of analyzing Jung and Freud's polemic is another disappointment.

However, with Carl Jung's vision into the future at one point, and with some other points in the film which start pushing it into the Hollywood category I think the film tries too hard at times to be more than it is.

My fear was that they made some cheesy Hollywood-like version of the real story and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not the case. The meaning that the film conveys, in my view, is what the story was in reality-a paradox of how ethical violation and the trauma it caused Sabina co-existed with her healing, how two extraordinary men were so controlled by their egos that it didn't allow them to continue to collaborate, which slowed down the development of the whole field of psychoanalysis and how this woman (Sabina)was wiser and more enlightened than two of them combined. The only disappointing element of the film was Emma Jung's character. Their presentation of Emma was nothing like she was in reality and was disrespectful to her as a person, in my opinion. They portrayed her as a little homemaker, who needed nothing else except being a wife and a mother, and this is not even close to who Emma was. She was very ambitious, she was a practicing psychoanalyst herself and she suffered a great deal because of social constraints that didn't allow her to establish herself as a professional. Knightly's performance was superb, Fassbender was good too. Mortensen, in my view, was not the best choice for playing Freud but it didn't spoil the whole experience for me.

Loved this film even though some of the script was a bit staid. Mortensen's performance was restrained (or repressed ??) and Fassbender was convincing as Jung (pre psychotic episode). Vincent Cassel as the delinquent and sexually transgressive Otto was the perfect counter for Fassbenders lightly disguised morality (and even perhaps his alter ego). Heavy going at times but made me think about the other themes of Cronenbergs output and maybe they need a re-evaluation, from a Freudian perspective of course.

176,Hypedupturtle,"Interesting, but inherently flawed",5,1 April 2012,"This film confused me somewhat. Having studied both Jung and Freud's works to a relatively high degree, I felt that the film was contradictory in its intent. On the one hand,it does contain very simplistic incarnations of Jung and Freud's theories, yet on the other, the majority were neither explained well enough to be recognisable to the novice, nor in-depth/complex enough to appeal to the savvy. Fassbender doesn't quite do Jung justice, portraying him as more of a middle-class every-man rather than the deeply introspective, contemplative man that history records him as. However, his acting is generally strong, if a little misdirected in my eyes. Mortensen hits the nail on the head with Freud, which was enjoyable to see - deep, faceted and ultimately rather dark and brooding. His accent was effective. Knightley, whom I've always considered a very limited actress (despite being skilled at what little she can do) was well outside of her comfort zone in this film. Her Russian accent varied in efficacy, ranging from rather impressive at sporadic moments to disappointing at others. Her facial expressions were likewise capricious. She had the key elements of facial expression, posture and gesture at various points which should've worked, but she seemed unable to effectively string them together, leading to rather awkward transitions and a feeling of general mediocrity, even hilarity at one or two points. Ultimately, my major qualm with this film was its pacing. It jumped from point to point with little coherence or cohesion other than general chronology, missing out on both key theoretical points for the intellectual viewer and essential biographical moments for the historical viewer. The characters reflect this confusion in pacing, with Knightley making speedy transitions in character (which were appreciated at various points despite being a little flaccid), Fassbender staying very much stationary rather than depicting the enlightening journey that the real Jung undertook, and Mortensen once again providing the high points of the film with his appreciable talent shining through(apart from a rather ridiculous wobble and tumble during a scene which could've done with better direction.) The ending was highly disappointing, providing the viewer no closure or estimable conclusion; merely ending with Jung's prophetic vision of World War 1 (which is neither explained nor expanded upon, cutting almost instantaneously to flitting text that makes a half-hearted attempt at explaining each character's later progression.)What the film did focus on was Jung's internal struggle with his sexual instincts. However, if you were hoping for lewd or intimate sex scenes, you'll be somewhat disappointed: despite the director's penchant for having Knightley expose her nipples every 15 minutes, little else is revealed other than slightly awkward scenes in which Jung beats a writhing Spielrein. The film is by no means worthless, but it does miss various and highly important points in every respect no matter what you're expecting from it, which become even more apparent to the esoteric viewer or just breeze by amidst the hazey storyline for the casual movie-goer. I wouldn't even recommend this film to students looking to bolster their understanding because there is generally that little information besides basic context, which you will find more of in a cheaper and less time consuming book. However if you're watching this merely to experience the acting, then enjoy another great performance by Viggo Mortensen.Definitely a bargain-bin buy.",A Dangerous Method

I felt the dialogues were insanely uninteresting, flat and simply unbelievable.The acting now is a whole different thing. I don't judge any actor for anything they did because they most of time (at least I hope so) did it for a reason and for a believe. On the other hand it doesn't smaller the fact that Jung's character was totally inconsistent to me by being so naive towards Freud and Gross but so forward and strict and analyzing towards Spielrein then again this movie is about sexual behavior and he is driven by his own.Gross's character was way to important to Jung and the whole relationship was just hard for me to follow since Gross was shown only three times in the movie. I think Mortensen has done a terrific job from my point of view and Freud was actually the only character I could feel a little sympathy for him.For Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) I can only say I was horrified by the whole character. Now I'm taking in account that people who are in a mental asylum are often acting in a horrifying way but nonetheless is her whole development way to fast and I could not believe that a person who is that insane would be able to achieve such a high degree in such a fast way and get over the own problems almost at the same time.Plus I'm now using some words I heard today ""It felt like she was desperately going for an academy award"" where in my opinion she won't even get a nomination.",A Dangerous Method

182,Beadmatrix,Spielrein Suffers Another Disappointment,4,31 March 2012,"It was a shock to see such an austere and unsatisfying film from the usually rich and complex David Cronenberg. The book on which it is based is quite dense, and vivid, with layer upon layer of meaning and consequence. The revelation of Spielrein's case is not that a patient and doctor became sexually involved, which the film treats as shocking despite the fact that it was well known as rampant in those days, but that the patient outstripped her doctors in her theory of an instinct to destruction and was actively repressed by the same doctors that were now her peers. We see Freud praise her in private regarding her remarks to the nascent association of psychoanalysts, but in public he minimized her accomplishments and denigrated her theory as a distorted shadow of his own. And the film doesn't really state her theory clearly in layman's terms, even though it is really quite simple: that we as human beings can get lost in our sexual relationships, and that we resist losing ourselves, our sense of self, as much as we desire that closeness; and that all of this is rooted in our primeval instinct to reproduce. Resistance is futile - we can't help what we feel, but we can choose who to be involved with and how. Freud resisted the notion that it was the analyst's responsibility to help a patient constructively redirect that energy, or that the creative impulse could ever truly be separate from sex itself.Her relationship with Jung, meanwhile, appears stilted and primly staged, with none of the chemistry, or ""poetry"" as Sabina called it, that arose between the brilliant and resilient woman who captivated a brilliant and vulnerable man. They are reduced to enacting sterile and simplistic BDSM scenes in which Spielrein still appears hysterical and Jung appears bewildered.Viggo Mortensen came close to disappearing into his role as Freud, but the filmmakers repress an essential key to his character as well: the fact that although he was married, Jung knew he was involved with his sister-in-law, who lived with him as well, an incestuous relationship in everyone's eyes. In today's terms, we would say that Sabina longed for a love-child from her soul-mate Jung, which is the story behind the reference to Wagner's operas, and that she couldn't bear to be near him when he refused her. Jung was Freud's ""son and heir"", so if Sabina agreed to let go of Jung where else could she turn for both personal help and professional supervision without betraying him? Freud used his knowledge of the relationship to bully Jung, and both Jung and Spielrein hesitated to use what they had learned from the relationship professionally for fear that their peers, and the public, would recognize what had happened between them. Although the small community of analysts and patients was quite incestuous, both intellectually and sexually, they were quite reasonably afraid that the radical new practice of psychoanalysis would be condemned by a less enlightened public if their methods, and their foibles, were truly known. So they fought amongst themselves, and threw Spielrein to the wolves. She practically married the first man she met after her ideas were spurned by Freud, and tried to build a life. But it didn't last.I haven't even finished reading the book, but Spielrein's virtual disappearance from history is not assuaged by the story in this film. Do yourself a favor, and read John Kerr's book. Perhaps one day Spielrein will get her due.",A Dangerous Method

Its only weakly relevant; its interesting enough to watch on its own- but if you would like to learn something or be moved, this is not the film for you.",A Dangerous Method
187,brenogorman,Keira Knightley actor or over-actor?,3,23 November 2011,"This is not David Cronenberg finest hour, in fact its close to awful. This is largely thanks to Keira Knightley and her awful over-acting.Supposedly suffering from a psycho-sexual disorder she spends the first half the movie convulsing and contorting like a tortured mongoloid as if trying to dry retch her way out of chronic constipation. She improves a lot in the 2nd half of the movie but too late to undo the damage.Tho it had so much potential, the whole movie is also a little stiff and dull and we only get a glimpse into the workings of Freuds' mind as he poisons a generation with his fraudulent psychoanalytical quackery.",A Dangerous Method
188,zarmattathustra,A historical review,9,12 January 2012,"I should start with saying something of my Prejudices: #1 Jung and Freud were huge heros of mine growing up #2 I'm a Cronenberg fan.This movie reminds me a bit of Naked Lunch in the sense that it seems like there's depths beyond the surface.. in terms of how we can read the movie as we watch it.A Historical Perspective:Cronenberg has some background in psychoanalysis (Freud), and seeing how there's a kind of political fight between Freud and Jung going on to this day, I was very curious to see how Cronenberg would play it. What surprised me was the degree to which he seemed to be on Jung's side..Knowing the historical background, I was utterly fascinated with the choices Cronenberg makes in the path he chooses to walk in telling the story. There's the morality of the historical moment, and then there's the morality of our modern moment.. and how we look at historical figures.. the question of to what degree we should judge historical figures by the standards of our time versus understanding them in the context of there own time.. In a certain way the whole story is really about morality.. or values... and a kind of questioning of sexual values.. and existential question of how human beings should live in society.. or how we should relate to society.. Its about the relationship between instinct and nature and morality as socially proscribed or individually found. All the characters of the story are involved in this kind of searching.This becomes the lens we see through and it's interesting that Jung is painted as the more modern man.. the person who seems so ahead of his time.. We come to see his polygamy as both a kind of moral foible and as strangely not so wrong.. There's a strange quality to the dark undercurrents of Jung's affair.. One thinks of eye's wide shut.. in how morality of character shapes reality.. as if reality were a kind of phantom.. and is this what we are saying about human sexuality, or feminine sexuality? I'm not 100% sure of where the film comes out on this.. but that it dares to go as deep as it does, into this sorta thing, sets it above 90% of the films being made these days..Here's where I disagree with the movie:Jung is somewhat famous for being a bit of a bully.. and he himself complained about some of the translations done of his works.. that he wanted them to be ""more earthy"" and less.. I guess sorta intellectual - ism - ish? And so I was sorta disappointed that there character of Jung had none of these more earthly qualities. Why, for instance.. are the cloath's he's waring so utterly new / unworn? It's as if the wardrobe is sorta shallow in its roll as a story telling device, for instance. There's a famous confrontation between Freud and Jung.. where Jung seems to have a kind of precognition thing going on, which freaks Freud out. Freud thinks Jung is playing some kind of parlor trick on him. But in the movie's depiction we don't have this suspicion.. our only suspicion is that maybe Jung is going too far out on a limb with his thinking on ESP... and it seems to me that the scene would play infinitely more powerfully had it played true to the actual event, and perhaps given us some sort insight into Jung's thinking relative to the psychology of the numinous / etc... and where we perhaps wonder if he's playing a trick.I feel that I loved the film just cause I love Freud, Jung, and Cronenberg.. and so feel utterly biased on it... I'll have to see it a few more times before I'll know what I really think of it.. but if it is not a great movie it is at least an interesting one.. and so I find myself recommending it to most everyone I know",A Dangerous Method
189,rath_kyle,A screenplay by Wikipaedia,4,31 January 2012,"I find this title extremely literal and flat. The dialogue, apart from it being arduous to the point where it attempts to define an interpretation of psychoanalysis, is so incredibly literal, every sentence predicts the next and leaves absolutely no room for viewer interpretation - the audience is simply fed reams of wikipaedia information, bluntly.Because of this, the acting parts feel wooden and predictable. It seems Knightly understood the shortcomings of the film, thus detaching herself from the picture and instead decided early on to use the film as an audition video showcasing her adept emotional range. Thus, her part felt the most contrived. As for Fassbender, as if the writing wasn't dull enough, he delivers a performance so wrought with cliché and lackluster that any glimmer of suspenseful storytelling is crushed.We tend to always fall on the cliché of technical versus artistic and since this film isn't very imaginative, it is automatically a technical triumph. This isn't the case. Unfortunately the shots are as obvious as the script and any sense of auteurship is lost to the rigid editing and conservative cropping.I give it a 4/10",A Dangerous Method
190,lulusunderland,Appalling portrayal,1,8 February 2012,"I really like Jung's take on psychology and was very disappointed by this film. It barely delves into the origins or import of his work, focusing primarily on sex scenes which add very little to the small story the film carries in the first place. The dialogue is incredibly weak, while innumerable one-liners and pointless camera panning are employed to flesh out the sections between Jung spanking his patient/lover. The addition of Freud's character is rather disappointing too, as his interactions with Jung are fairly brief, uninteresting and largely disjointed from the rest of the film. The book ""memories, dreams and reflections"" offers a rather deeper and more accurate idea of Jung's life and work, but as for this film, it holds little value whether one has any interest in Jung or not and simply panders to Hollywood clichés.",A Dangerous Method
191,deftflicker,Oh Dear,1,20 February 2012,"Many have said that this film is about spanking. That seems as stupid as saying that Anna Karenia is about train spotting! It is sadly a very boring film that tells us nothing about Freud, Jung, Psychology,love or anything else. The acting is wooden, God even the spanking scenes are boring! Read Anna Karenia instead although it may disappoint train spotters but it has so much to tell us. How can anyone find a thousand words for such a banal rendition of the lives and ideas of the founders of psychology. An example of the inanity of the script; Freud and Jung are standing on the deck of an ocean liner approaching New York. We are shown a cityscape of skyscrapers. Jung turns to Freud and says ""Take my word for it, we are looking at the future"" Why did the chicken cross the road? to avoid passing the cinema that was showing this drivel!",A Dangerous Method
192,crct2004,Disappointed,3,6 January 2015,"After all the positive reviews, I had high hopes for this movie, but found myself very distracted. I love to be engaged in a story and kept hoping I would be, but I finally gave up, which is rare for me. I expected something far more intelligent and interesting. The acting was fine, but the content was pedestrian, more like a bad TV movie than an actual cinema piece. Seems Keira felt this and worked harder than anyone to make this a decent film, but her effort, while appreciated, was in vane. Worst of all is the horrific green screen, looks like something from the 70's. Very disappointed, this movie could have been so much more.",A Dangerous Method

194,foronlinedatingonly,A Man's Fantasy World,1,15 May 2012,"I just hated this story and the movie. Its a view of women from a narcissistic and cowardly voyeur-like male perspective. Its sex obsessed garbage. Its a world that could only exist in a man's self-centered dreamy mind. Men readers, please don't think for a second that a woman, even the most twisted one you can find, could ever be even remotely like the character that Keira Knightly so brainlessly signed up to play. This movie is about as fictional and full of crap as Sci Fi. The male disrespect for the way women truly think and are is just shamelessly delivered out in the open with this film. This story is all about a men's fantasy about what he wishes could unfold in his world, but never would. And Keira Knightley's excess use of emotion is sickening. You could get an equally entertaining and meaningful story out of a typical porn flick.",A Dangerous Method

And Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) was awesome as usual.A bit disappointed that the film: only touched on synchronicity twice;didn't mention the collective unconscious;didn't mention Anima/Animus;didn't mention his other famous relationships (i.e. with Sir Laurens van der Post, Richard Wilhelm, Einstein); anddidn't go into much detail about his analytical methods (e.g. playing with toys like we did as children) - although they did have snippets of word association and dream analysis.Having said that, there's not much you can do with 1.5 hours for a film!

198,ccamp3175-687-629628,Using true stories...,9,16 May 2013,"...is always very risky. It's unfortunate that life doesn't really imitate art, and to have a screenplay constrained by real events makes the process difficult. I double my kudos, ergo, for this movie. I thought it was extremely informative as a slice of history, and was certainly dramatic in the development of several plots, e.g. the Freud-Jung relationship, the Spielrein-Jung nexus, etc., etc.Fooey to all you who judge this film so harshly. I was entranced. My SINGLE misgiving occurred during one of those those too-rare :) kinky bits, when I thought ""Heavens, Herr Doktor Professor, she is SUCH a naughty girl that I'm surprised you didn't refer her to a really GOOD sadist. I know just the right fellow, too.""",A Dangerous Method

200,baconmfr,dead wisdom,8,31 January 2012,"A Dangerous Method (2011) is a film about temptation and seduction; the breaking of professional etiquette; the falling out between two aging academics and the use of a 'Talking Cure' for people suffering from mental problems. Another poignant insight into the life of the soul from director David Cronenberg, who is no stranger to controversy and not afraid of exploring the perverse side of human nature. Abnormal animalistic behaviour, tormented psyches and sadomasochistic tendencies are all treated with his usual flair, tact, skill and sympathy.The film has a dark, obscure side and is unsettling, but definitely not dirty or tacky – it has found a form of sensuality all of its own. Keira Knightley takes a huge risk by taking on the tricky role of Sabina Spielrein, a disturbed young Russian.Knightley must be considered as being one of the most beautiful women in the world, and has fashioned a unique way of expressing female sexuality – she has matured into nothing short of a screen goddess, who merits at the very least an Oscar nomination- with her spirited, harrowing depiction of an insane, frustrated nymphomaniac and her road to recovery shows her depth, diversity and allure.Psychoanalysis is Austria's biggest export after the apple strudel. But was it 'the method' that cured our gorgeous Sabina, or sex? If a healthy sex life leads to a healthy mind, then sex is perhaps the cure, not the talking? Jung provides both for safe measure – played by the studious and sanguine Michael Fassbender, he puts his career and reputation on the line by failing to control his own libido as he slips into a torrid affair with his irresistible patient. Viggo Mortenson plays the serious historical figure of Freud with well-calibrated austerity and authority. His friendship with Jung hangs by a thread, as the young disciple becomes frustrated with his master's inflexibility.The use of the word 'method' reminded me of one of the greatest movie scenes of all time between Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now (1979), which goes along the lines of 'Do you think my methods are unsound? I see no method here sir.' OK, this may be stretching my point a bit, but you catch my drift. As Mike Dundee pointed out in Crocodile Dundee (1986): 'What's the use of an analyst if you've got mates?' Isn't 'talking' what we've been doing since we invented language? Is there more to psychoanalysis than dream interpretation and word games? Not according to this film. For a deeper and a more interesting view on the subconscious or unconscious and a telling counter-point to the psychoanalysis phenomena, I recommend The Fantasia of the Unconscious (1921) by D. H. Lawrence.Philosophy was a much broader subject at the start of 20th century than at the end. Psychology grew into a science and psychoanalysis, well, is still practised by gypsy fortune tellers and those annoying websites that claim to be able to tell you whether or not your ex-partner is still in love with you. Jung's weapon, the method of his master, lacks punch – it's lucky he had a backup plan and a belt for the problematic Sabina.The pace of the film is steady and its communication of ideas and material just about right, giving touching observations and thought-provoking dialogue that is not at all dull or overly complicated. As the story unfolds, the line between hunter and prey becomes blurred, similar to the relationship between Paul and Jeanne in Last Tango in Paris (1972).Who is seducing who? Who has the upper hand? Who is manipulating who? Who is using and who is abusing? Dr. Jung becomes the victim in the end and the connection between sexuality and emotional disorder becomes hazy. With interest in their subject drying up, the two academics run out of steam and start to bicker – left with a withering vision, dead wisdom and a too-hot-to-handle patient.Like in Bend it like Beckham (2002), the wily Miss Knightley steals the show and beats both Jung and Freud at their own game. Sex is sacrifice, she argues. Losing your ID, or ego, is part of the course – the sexual act obliges a nullification of the self... For spiritual enlightenment I would put my faith in 1980s pop singer Stacey Q of Two of Hearts fame, ahead of Jung or Freud.I was almost expecting a football style shirt removing celebration, after her verbal victory, but our English rose has already done a topless scene, (god bless you maam) and perhaps not appropriate given the austere Austrian setting. Yes i think a dame hood is order here, in addition to the Oscar. Is there a place for psychoanalysis? absolutely! but let's not get carried away believing it to be a science. The correct place for this sort of thing is, of course, the pub, where spurious ideas about sex can be discussed endlessly over copious amounts of beer as is the English tradition.I was sceptical of the importance of Jung and Freud concerning their contributions to the understanding of the human condition and subconsciousness before I saw the film, and am even more so now. But this aside, the film tackles an interesting topic and it succeeds because of great directing and superb acting.It's encouraging that mainstream film-making has evolved to an extent where ideas about existence, sex and emotional stability can be dealt with in such an intelligent and thorough manor, but it leaves me with just one question – when is someone going to make a film about the life of D. H. Lawrence, the true architect of the modern human mind-scape?",A Dangerous Method
