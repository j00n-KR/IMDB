0,TheLittleSongbird,"Should have soared, but a case of taking off well initially but landing with a thud too early",6,12 April 2019,"The original 'Dumbo' is still one of my favourites. Beautifully animated, with memorable songs and sequences (especially ""Baby Mine"" and ""Pink Elephants on Parade""), a touching story that still moves me and inspires me and one of for me the most relatable characters ever in Dumbo, being someone who was bullied for being different and having to overcome adversity.Part of me was excited in seeing this new 'Dumbo'. The trailer did look great. Have loved a few of Disney's other live-action remakes namely 'Cinderella' and particularly 'The Jungle Book'. Also love a good deal of Tim Burton's films, with my favourites being 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood' and 'Beetlejuice', also love 'Big Fish', 'Sleepy Hollow', 'Sweeney Todd' and 'Batman'. Part of me was nervous too, because not all remakes fare well (with abominations like 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man' and 'Rollerball') and will admit to questioning the point of it, did think how is one going to make a feature length film out of something that was merely an hour long. Burton is a hit and miss director as well, starting off great but has been particularly variable since his worst film 'Planet of the Apes'.As far as Burton's films go, 'Dumbo' is in the lesser half. Certainly better than 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', 'Dark Shadows', 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Planet of the Apes', but 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' it is not. It is not Disney at its best either and among the weaker Disney live-action remakes. Do not think it is as bad as some have said but am also somewhat mixed in my opinion of the 2019 'Dumbo'. A case of pretty good first half and disappointing second half.'Dumbo' does look great. It is lavishly photographed and produced, showing the glamour but also hardships of circus life. Then again, what does one expect from Burton? Regardless of how his films are overall, they always are very well made visually. Dumbo himself hardly looks fake (a long way from it), moves smoothly and an example of a CGI animal on film with soul and heart, he also has such expressive eyes that tell so much and makes one relate to and feel for him without feeling they have to. Danny Elfman's sumptuously orchestrated, sometimes sensitive and at other times soaring score is one of his best in a long time.There are some great scenes here with two scenes having genuine pathos, one being ""Baby Mine"" (not quite as devastating as in the original, but still touching and well used) and the somewhat bittersweet ending. Standing out too is the visually quite jaw-dropping bubble take on ""Pink Elephants"". The circus sequences look great in design and photography, are cleverly choreographed making for some heart-stopping spectacle and the fun and danger of the circus is well depicted. The first half does have poignancy, while Dumbo is absolutely adorable with expressive eyes and expressions and a sense of innocence. Some of the acting is not bad, the liveliest contribution coming from a full of live Danny De Vito. Colin Farrell and Eva Green make the most of their fairly under-explored roles.However, the second half was not near as good for me. The main problems being that it felt padded and with its darker tone it felt like a different film. The pacing is affected, well it could have done with a tightening up in the first half too admittedly as the first portion of 'Dumbo' is slight, very like the original but that was part of the charm, but it is more problematic later on. Momentum was mainly lost due to some of it feeling like padding and unfortuanately it was relatively overlong padding. The darker 'Dumbo' got, the more the charm, innocence and pathos vanished until all three were completely lost not long after the villain's intentions are revealed.Not all the acting registers that much. Finley Robbins and Nico Parker are rather bland, with Parker being particularly one-note, while Michael Keaton is a one-dimensional cartoon. The other circus performers are not fleshed out or shown enough to register that much. The characters are thin, too many promising plot points and such are not followed enough after being introduced and the script is cluttered and sometimes repetitive. There isn't really enough story to fill a feature-length film, with the original's plot done away with not too far through, and the film, especially evident in the second half, felt over-stretched. The climax brought a little energy back but again too far apart tonally from the first half of the film.In conclusion, plenty of good things but also a good deal of short-comings. Just a touch above mixed-bag quality. 5.5/10",Dumbo
1,Leofwine_draca,Soulless,4,25 December 2019,"Another soulless work from director Tim Burton, who lost his distinctive style and talent a good decade or so ago. This one's an ill-advised remake of the Disney cartoon classic, although why they bother with this live action versions I don't know because the main character and most of the backdrops turn out to be animated anyway. Dumbo himself is a cutesy CGI grey blob, supposedly endearing but not even close to realistic, and the other CGI effects are typically bland. The story is predictability in itself and you can guess the sickening sentiment of the climax from the very first scene. All that's left is the cast, and there are a lot of familiar faces here, but they're all cast in usual-for-them roles so don't have to put much work in. Eva Green is alluring and exotic, Danny DeVito brash and noisy, Michael Keaton snarky and superior, Colin Farrell the heroic father figure. The kids come off better, but this isn't interesting at all, just an exercise in box-ticking.",Dumbo
2,SnoopyStyle,Disney dark,6,19 June 2019,"It's 1919. Siblings Milly and Joe Farrier welcome their father Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) home to the circus after he lost his arm in the war. They had lost their mother to the influenza outbreak. Max Medici (Danny DeVito) runs the traveling circus. He had sold Holt's horses and puts him in charge of a newly purchased pregnant elephant. A baby elephant with giant ears is born. The kids teaches Dumbo to fly but nobody believes them. Dumbo shocks the world and New York showman V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) recruits the Medici circus to his Dreamland amusement park. Vandevere orders trapeze artist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) to fly with Dumbo.Director Tim Burton brings his dark surreal style to the Disney classic. The dark tone is troublesome but not a deal breaker. The more problematic issue is some of the human reactions. I don't understand Medici's automatic dislike of Dumbo. His giant ears should be a selling point and a good operator could do wonders with Dumbo. The violent trainer is too one dimensional. I was hoping for more dimensions and then he gets killed. As for Vandevere, destroying Dumbo's mom makes no sense other than dramatic sense. No capitalist would willingly destroy an asset when that asset could be exploited. It's a lot of little bumps in the road but the overwhelming sense is the dark sadness that permeates the movie. An elephant flying should be an idea of magic. The only truly magical scene is the bubbles scene which alludes to the earlier Disney movies. This is functional Burton but it's not a magical kiddie movie.",Dumbo
3,jboothmillard,Dumbo,4,31 March 2019,"The classic cartoon is one of my most favourite animated films of all time, Disney have had a run of successful animation to live-action remakes, including The Jungle Book, and Beauty and the Beast, so Dumbo seemed another obvious choice, directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland). Basically set in 1919, Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to his children, curious science-minded daughter Milly (Nico Parker) and enthusiastic son Joe (Finley Hobbins), following the First World War, during which he lost his arm. Holt is an equestrian performer at the Medici Brothers' Circus, run by Max Medici (Danny DeVito), but the circus is having financial troubles. Holt is reassigned as caretaker for the circus's pregnant elephant, Mrs Jumbo. The female elephant gives birth to a calf with abnormally large ears, Medici has already asked the baby elephant's birth to be publicised, he insists the large ears are hidden from the public before they present him. However, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance. The crowd mockingly name the calf Dumbo and throw peanuts and other objects at him, Mrs Jumbo is distressed and rampages the circus ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally killing the abusive handler Rufus Sorghum (Phil Zimmerman). Medici sells Mrs Jumbo in order to prevent a public relations disaster, leaving Dumbo sad and alone, but the children comfort him. Milly and Joe discover that Dumbo can fly by flapping his ears, they find that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly. Medici decides to make Dumbo a clown, becoming a firefighter to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk. But the performance goes wrong, and Dumbo gets trapped at the top of the structure surrounded by flames, Milly risks delivering a feather to him, giving Dumbo confidence to fly. The crowd is astounded to see an elephant fly, and word of Dumbo begins to spread. Businessman and owner Dreamland amusement park, V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration, Medici would become his partner, and the circus troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland. Later, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with trapeze artist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) on his back. But their debut perform goes wrong, Dumbo panics almost falling, he trumpets, and across the park Mrs Jumbo hears him, she calls in response. Dumbo hears his mother's call and flies out of the circus ring to the Nightmare Island exhibit elsewhere in Dreamland to reunite with his mother. Fearing that Dumbo's mother may distract Dumbo from performing, Vandevere orders Mrs Jumbo is taken away and killed, he also fires all of the Medici performers. Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn Vandevere intends to kill Mrs Jumbo, so they plan to set both Jumbo and Dumbo free. The circus performers use their various talents to break Mrs Jumbo out while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but accidentally starts a fire mishandling Dreamland's electricity system, the fire spreads and destroys the park. Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, he and his mother are taken by Holt, Colette, the children and the troupe to the harbour to board a ship back to their native home. In the end, the Medici circus is renamed the Medici Family Circus, Vandevere may have been arrested for arson through misconduct, Colette has become part of the troupe, while Dumbo and Mrs Jumbo reunite with a herd of elephants in the jungle. Also starring Alan Arkin as J. Griffin Remington, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Roshan Seth as Pramesh Singh, Moulin Rouge's Deobia Oparei as Rongo, Joseph Gatt as Neils Skellig, Miguel Muñoz Segura as Ivan the Wonderful, Zenaida Alcalde as Catherine the Greater, Downton Abbey's Douglas Reith as Sotheby, My Mad Fat Diary's Sharon Rooney as Miss Atlantis, Frank Bourke as Puck the Organ Grinder, Michael Buffer (""Let's get ready for Dumbo!"") as Baritone Bates, Sandy Martin as Verna The Secretary and Lucy DeVito (Danny's daughter) as Coat Check Girl. This mix of computer animation and live-action is more from the point of view of the humans, Farrell and Green are alright, DeVito is likeable as the ringmaster, but Keaton is like a weird pantomime villain. It is good that they incorporated ""Baby Mine"" (which won the Oscar for Best Song for the original) at the right moment, the reinvention of the beloved ""Pink Elephants"" sequence with large animated bubbles is fun, the special effects are very good, and the score by Danny Elfman is great, but this remake doesn't have enough heart and charm like the outstanding original, which is disappointing, it's only just a reasonable fantasy adventure. Okay!",Dumbo
4,Quinoa1984,You'll believe an elephant can be half-hearted and soulless,4,1 December 2019,"I was ready to come on here and do a spiel about how I can never forget the time in an interview (I believe it was on ""The Directors"" documentary series, remember that from back in the day, nevermind) where Tim Burton declared (and I QUOTE), ""I wouldn't know a good script if it bit me in the face."" At the time, this almost was meant to be sort of self-deprecating, or something like that, as if it say that he can only rely on his gut when reading something to know if it will work on the screen, or that he's more interested in the visual potential. Honestly, I will be forever baffled that he would say such a thing without irony. but the fact is that when he said this (around 20 years or so ago), he had scripts that were smart and sharp and more often than not genuinely felt. Scripts for films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands and the Batmans, even Mars Attacks!, had more than enough potential to bring to life.Now we're in 2019, and Ehren Kruger couldn't bother to give Tim Burton a script that would poke him in the nose. This isn't even a bad script in an interesting or attention-grabbing way. It's just... half-baked, and that's the kind of bat Burton movie we get in return.Now, in full disclosure, the 1941 Dumbo is a film I still consider a classic (despite the racism); it had a remarkable and almost without peer Economy of Story, where it managed to tell so much and put in so much heart, with its highs and lows, that it managed to do so much in an hour. But I'd like to think I'm not a total crab movie guy, and I was open to seeing what off-beat touches Burton and company could bring to a modern Dumbo (and at least it's not a retooling/reimagining/re-everything of a film that's younger than I am, but I digress). What manages to be apparent really quickly is that Kruger's new ideas are like statements that get written early in a paper and then are never truly followed up on or explored (what I might call 'statments'), and that Burton, for all of his competency, is... not putting his heart into this.When I say half-baked, I'm talking about how the film tries to broach subjects, like how the public isn't accepting of a freakish ""other"" until it can do an extraordinary thing (and even then it's not like there's any indictment of the public past introducing it in the first big circus set piece), or the whole Conglomerate Takes Over the Little Guy But Squeezes Out Humanity thing - which might have been a subversive act against Disney itself, maybe, maybe not, but the filmmakers either don't care or they just use the backdrop ultimately for a shallow ""statment"" about the triumph of the spirit of the Little Guys over adversity of the Big Corporate Machine for a big climactic showdown. But what's even more striking is that Dumbo isn't even really the main character of his own story - it's mostly (supposedly at the start) about Colin Farrell's disillusionment coming home from the war without what he used to do in the circus (and with a dead wife no longer there to care for his children)... but his arc is also left to almost a shrug in the last act.Oh, and good lord the children. I have to be mean here for a beat: Nico Parker has no business being in this movie. This isn't to say most of the performances here are very *good* (DeVito is having some fun mugging, and Eva Green does what she can with a somewhat thinly written character and brings the most heart in the whole thing, while Keaton is... making a CHOICE for damn sure with this Capital-C Character, and at least seems to be amusing himself), but they are performances by professionals. Parker is only here because she's the daughter of Thandie Newton, and while her being here may be another decision on Burton's part to make this Dumbo his own, it's an abysmal decision: she says every line with the sort of deadpan I would expect from someone in The Dead Don't Die. The other child as her brother is a non-entity too, but at least not noticeably so. With Parker, it's a gaping void where personality goes to die.And I know it can't be a Modern Disney Remake without it including lots of stuff that connects back to the original, but it's bizarre what does and doesn't get in here. The Pink Elephants is turned around into being just a ""dazzling"" minute or so of a larger set piece (Dumbo looking at circus performers making elephants out of bubbly water), while the Crows are of course gone (the way the feather is worked in actually is... okay, not very good but not bad, it makes sense). But if this movie needed to get ANYTHING right, it would be the relationship between Mrs. Jumbo and her little Jumbo, Jr., and Kruger and Burton spend barely any time with them (the ""Baby Mine"" number is here, of course, and even that feels something like an after-thought, like ""Oh yeah, we gotta put that in here, let's have someone sing it without any connection to the elephants."" That encapsulates what I mean about the economy of storytelling that this can't match up even if it tried: Disney and his writers in 1940 packed in so much potent visual storytelling and emotion in a few scenes, while this tries to shove in some lip-service to Believing In Yourself and the Power of Mother's Love, but it moves much too quickly in a run-time that's almost double the original.This isn't even a disaster I can get very mad about, but it does rank with the other disappointments of 2019. I'm not even one of those who says that Burton is beyond the pale or hasn't made a good movie since X date years ago (I though his previous two films, Big Eyes and Mrs. Peregrine, ranged from very good to decent). But this represents a nadir in a slightly different way than a Planet of the Apes; that was not good, but it felt like at least he was trying to put his stamp on it and just fumbled the ball in some key ways. This is a misfire in a way that reminds me of directors of old who, in their later years, were going through the motions, and it was really just so sad. There are signs that he was present for some of this, at least in the casting, and good god is Danny Elfman working over-time to add life/levity/excitement to the proceedings. But it's like looking at a bloodless animatronic of an Edward Scissorhands figure: the look is there, but the soul is gone.",Dumbo
5,Coventry,"Oh Brother Burton, Where Art Thou?",4,15 May 2019,"Yours truly is largely unopinionated regarding the currently popular cinematic trend to transfer animated classics into live-action feature films. My first and spontaneous reaction would be that it's further proof to demonstrate that Hollywood is running out of inspiration while they do attempt to drain more profit out of old successes, but I don't want to judge the actual films without having seen them. It probably won't happen, since I'm not interested in ""Jungle Book"" or ""Beauty and the Beast"" and I don't intend to see ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"", neither. I did have two very solid reasons to go and stand in line for ""Dumbo"" with my entire family. #1: I have been a giant Tim Burton fan my entire life. #2: my 4-year-old daughter recently discovered the original animated Disney classic (can you believe that one got released in 1941 already?) and this genuinely magical masterpiece sparked my interest to watch the new version and to share this experience with her. At the same time, however, I tried keeping my expectations low. Tim Burton's last great film, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", is already 12 years old, and even that one wasn't nearly as unique and authentic as ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", etc... Also, Burton used to be a beautiful freak and his films embodied darkness, morbidity and fantasy landscapes. The fact I'm allowed to see his newest film in the company of a 4-year-old isn't very promising.Alas, it quickly becomes abundantly clear that ""the old Tim Burton"" will never return. Admittedly ""Dumbo"" doesn't provide the subject matter to turn into dark fantasy tales and the film certainly does contain a few noteworthy and positive moments, but the problem lies deeper. It's a soulless film, utterly devoid of passion and the power of imagination. The entire thing is one giant and digitalized merry-go-round attraction and Burton's traditional personal touches are nowhere to be found. The potentially fascinating supportive characters (including ALL the circus artists) are wasted, the references towards the brilliant '41 original (the pink elephants sequence, the music and the little circus mouse) are seemingly thrown in because it was mandatory, and the primary moralizing messages (the ugly duckling variant and trust in oneself) have been replaced by imposed compulsory messages, like ""Free all animals!"" or criticism against large corporations that take over small but creative companies. Speaking of which, how hypocrite is the plot of Vandervere's mastodon theme park swallowing the traditional Medici circus and abruptly killing its creative employees? This is basically what Disney is doing with Star Wars, Marvel and even Tim Burton's persona. Are they predicting their entire imperium will eventually burn to the ground, maybe? ""Dumbo"" doesn't just solely exist of CGI-effects, it also appears to be directed by a computer or a CGI-machine instead of by a creative human being. And, judging by his numb and impassive performance here, Colin Farrell clearly thought so as well.But hey, I can't finish my review without acknowledging that my darling daughter joyously cheered and shouted each time when the cute little elephant flew around the circus tent, and admittedly that sight also sent modest shivers down my spine.",Dumbo
6,studioAT,A modern Dumbo,5,14 August 2019,"I hadn't seen the original 'Dumbo' before seeing this remake, but I can now say, having watching the 1941 'classic' that I much prefer this version.It's a well made piece of entertainment, with enough good performances from the human cast (not to mention a very sweet CGI Dumbo) to justify the running time.It does, as others have said, go on a bit, and the ending, even for Disney standards feels a bit OTT, but I enjoyed the film overall.",Dumbo
7,oscaralbert,Shining a bright klieg light upon one of History's most vile villains . . .,9,27 April 2019,". . . DUMBO hits many of the low notes marking ""Tommy Edison's"" baleful ballet. Standing in for billionaire ""Alva"" is ""V.A. Van De Vere,"" a glory-hogging megalomaniac just like his Real Life counterpart. This latter self-styled ""inventor"" of light bulbs, recorded music, movies, and cement houses is epitomized by the ruthlessly corrupt corporate capitalist Van De Vere, as both characters heartlessly demean their employees as if they were NOT human beings, but interchangeable widgets of little worth. Van De Vere even builds his ""Dreamland"" Amusement Park as a Coney Island clone. THAT New York City landmark was the Real Life site of Tommy's most outrageous felony committed during a long criminal career. When DUMBO's nemesis Van De Vere orders the pachyderm's mom ""Mrs. Jumbo"" to be assassinated on Trumped-up murder charges, it's a perfect echo of Alva's notorious 1904 snuff film--ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT--in which the Demon of Menlo Park chained the Big Apple's beloved ""Topsy"" to a stake on Coney Island and used his defective ""Direct Current"" to literally burn her alive as she shrieked for the ""entertainment"" of a large male crowd for many minutes. (The U.S. Library of Congress' Website is still running this sadistic flick.) Fittingly, DUMBO climaxes with Van De Vere silhouetted against a Dreamland inferno caused by his crazed lust for ""Direct Current"" (the exact thing resulting in Tommy's Real Life downfall!).",Dumbo
8,AlsExGal,Does Disney hire boring directors or does their process make directors boring?,5,17 August 2019,"...because this film is rather dull, and the direction is certainly dull, and 10 years ago I would not have called Tim Burton a boring director. He's certainly working with two of his ""regulars"" - DeVito, who has not lost a step in all these years and next to CGI Dumbo is the best thing about the film.
And then there is Burton's other ""regular"" - Michael Keaton, as the rich villain. How weird for Disney to make a film with a guy who could be Walt Disney as the villain! ""Dreamland"" is certainly an allegory for ""Disneyland"".The worst thing about the film? The child actors. They are that bad and deliver their lines in a kind of drugged monotone. Not since Larry Mathews played Ritchie Petrie on the Dick Van Dyke Show has a child actor dragged everybody else down with them every time they appear like these kids did.I actually liked the CGI Dumbo - the little guy was very expressive in a way that 1941's animated Dumbo could not be. Ultimately there is probably a 50/50 chance you are going to like this.",Dumbo
9,ferguson-6,it's a Burton!,6,29 March 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of Disney's commitment to live action remakes of so many of their animated classics; however, I'll readily admit that teaming the always creative Tim Burton with every child's favorite pachyderm piqued my interest. In case you don't recall, Disney's fourth animated feature film was released in 1941, and told the story of a baby elephant who could fly thanks to the flapping of his enormous ears. DUMBO was, at its core, a story of how being different can cause you to be an outcast, while also delivering the strength to overcome those who might treat you poorly or look to profit at your expense. It was a sweet and simple message delivered in a brief 64 minutes.Taking up almost another hour, filmmaker Burton and screenwriter Ehren Kruger seize the original book by husband and wife writing team Harold Pearl and Helen Aberson and deliver a story that is anything but simple. Rather it's complicated, convoluted and at times nonsensical. What does work is the visual splendor of watching a cute little elephant fly around a circus ... first a tattered old-timey tent camp and later a futuristic amusement park.It takes only about 30 seconds for us to recognize the silver screen stylings of Tim Burton. The ragged train cars in need of paint followed by the black smoke from Casey's 'smiley' face engine, all point to the familiar visuals that harken back to Mr. Burton's memorable films like FRANKENWEENIE, BEETLEJUICE, BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BATMAN RETURNS, CORPSE BRIDE, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND (to name a few).It's 1919 as the train clackety-clacks from Sarasota, Florida through small southern towns and up to Joplin, Missouri, where youngsters Milly (Nico Parker, lookalike daughter of Thandie Newton) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) give a hug to their father Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell). Holt has been away serving in WWI, and returns minus one arm and one wife ... while he was at war, she lost her battle to illness, leaving the children in the care of the circus performers. Holt and his wife used to be featured performers in the Medici Brothers Circus run by Max Medici (Danny Devito), but times are tough and Holt is assigned to elephant-tending duty, where Max has recently purchased a pregnant Mrs. Jumbo elephant.We don't have to wait long for the baby to arrive, be called a ""freak"" by Max, learn to fly, be separated from his mother, and be targeted by a greedy amusement park owner named V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton). Vandevere's Dreamland has some familiar Disneyland elements, and serves it purpose for reminding us that traditional circuses are being replaced by high tech amusement parks - an environment more in line with today's youth.Where the film suffers is with its unnecessarily complicated story and underdeveloped characters. The usually reliable Mr. Keaton never really kicks in as the greedy and evil amusement park owner. Mr. Devito mostly yells his lines, and Mr. Farrell just seems categorically miscast. In what is the first film for both, young Ms. Parker shows flashes of talent, while Mr. Hobbins is given next to nothing to do. Eva Green does bring a welcome element as aerial artist Colette, but Alan Arkin's role as a banker seems tacked on as a favor. Unfortunately we barely get to know the circus troupe, though Miss Atlantis (Sharon Rooney) strums her ukulele as she sings ""Baby Mine"", the Oscar nominated song from the 1941 original, penned by Ned Washington and Frank Churchill. Adding to the Burton oddities, Michael Buffer makes an appearance as ring announcer ... albeit a different ring than what he is most often associated with.It likely won't surprise you that Mr. Burton delivers a film much darker than the original, and at least he avoided the temptation of talking animals (the legendary Mel Blanc voiced Dumbo in the original). He does offer up a nod to the Pink Elephant sequence from the original, as well as the presence of mice ... though wisely no crows this time around. Danny Elfman's score is a perfect fit (as usual) and Oscar winning Set Designer Rick Heinrick (SLEEPY HOLLOW) works his magic, as does 4-time Oscar winning Costume Designer Colleen Atwood (ALICE IN WONDERLAND). The technical mastery of the film is finalized with the work of Cinematographer Ben Davis, whose work on such grand scale films as CAPTAIN MARVEL, DOCTOR STRANGE, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY allows him to make the best of the visuals, even while the story disappoints. There is a contemporary message delivered near the end regarding the captivity of animals, and despite the dark, overly complicated story, it's still quite fun to watch Dumbo fly.",Dumbo
10,FlashCallahan,1 down 2 to dumb-go....,2,2 April 2019,"So is this where the bubble bursts for the live action remakes of Disney classics?If it is, then Aladdin and The Lion King should fear for their CGI, as Burton's creation is stillborn.All CGI and actors from the directors better films does not make a good piece of work, and here is a prime example.I was never looking forward to this film, It felt like a pointless exercise, but, with Burton at the Helm, it could have been something different, and given that Dumbo '41 is a pretty dark affair, Burton seemed like the right candidate.But like Planet Of the Apes, and more or less everything he's done since Dark shadows, it feels like he has his hands tied behind his back, and Disney has said 'look, you can have Elfman, a couple of visual ideas, and those two blokes from Batman Returns, but anything else, has to come through us'.And does it show.The film is devoid of soul, emotion, energy, or empathy. And considering the film deals with subjects such as PTSD, loss, and coming to terms with body image, it just handles everything much like a monkey in a draw.Farrell seems out of place, DeVito does his usual schtick he's being doing since 1974, and Keaton is emulating Depp in such a fashion, you really wish that Depp appeared in this film.At least it would have added some much needed curiosity value to the piece.All in all, it's a worthless dud, offering nothing but terrible CGI, and a bitter taste.",Dumbo
11,Wuchakk,"It looks great and has a fine cast, but the story's curiously lackluster",5,1 March 2021,"After WW1, a struggling American circus discovers they have a star attraction on hand, a big-eared baby elephant that can fly! Colin Farrell plays the one-armed elephant trainer, Danny DeVito the circus owner, Michael Keaton a Walt Disney-like entrepreneur and Eva Green his French performer.""Dumbo"" (2019) is a live-action remake of the 1941 classic and almost twice as long. Being made by Tim Burton, it LOOKS great and you can't beat the cast (except for the monotone kids). Unfortunately the story is generally dull. One can't help but think of the excellent ""Water for Elephants"" (2011), but this is nowhere near the same league. The flat script by Ehren Kruger needed reworked for more human interest and pizazz. It plays it too safe.It's strange that a Disney film would feature a Walt Disney-like character (with 'Dreamland' standing in for Disneyland), but put a malevolent spin on him. Meanwhile the sharp Green is serviceable as the aerial performer who works with Dumbo, but she seemed to be a tad long-in-the-tooth for the role at 38 during shooting.As a fan of the underrated ""Dark Shadows"" (2012) I thought I'd like this despite the bad reviews and mediocre box office performance. Wrong. It's okay, but that's not good enough for a live-action remake of such an iconic flick.The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes, and was shot in Cardington, Bedfordshire, England, and Pinewood Studios, which is about an hour south in the west London area.GRADE: C",Dumbo
12,gradyharp,"'You're a miracle elephant, Dumbo'",8,16 March 2020,"The 1941 Disney classic DUMBO, based on the book by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl, has been energized by Ehren Kruger's screenplay and Tim Burton's direction and the result is a live action plus photo-realistically computer-generated version that focuses a bit heavily on the evils of corporate greed...Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) was once a circus star, but he went off to WW I and returned missing his left arm. His wife fell victim to the Spanish flu outbreak, but his two children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins) greet him. Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) hires Holt to take care of Dumbo, a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him the laughing stock of the struggling circus troupe. But when Holt's children discover that Dumbo can fly, silver-tongued entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), and aerial artist Colette Marchant (Eva Green) swoop in to make the little elephant a star. From that point on the celebrity status turns sour when corporate greed in the form of both Vandevere and J. Griffin Remington (Alan Alda) destroy the magic. But Dumbo escapes to find his mother, Colette embraces the Farrier family, and of course it all turns out well.The performances by the actors are fine and the production itself is colorful if a tad overdone in the final stages of the Dreamland circus of Vandevere, but the tenderness between the children and Dumbo and Dumbo's mother Jumbo, and the pro-animals messages save the sentiment of the original.",Dumbo
13,blanbrn,High flying entertainment with a cute big ears baby elephant that's a fun connection of love and joy!,8,31 March 2019,"Always as a kid loved the classic ""Dumbo"" film as I loved the little baby elephant who was cute plus it made me sad and cry when he was taken away from his mom. Now with this live action update from mastermind director Tim Burton(""Batman"") the love and connection and fun is brought back to life. As Burton teams back up with some old friends Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito who were his ""Batman"" and ""Penguin"" players and the chemistry worked!The story is still pretty much simple and the same it follows a struggling traveling circus ran by Max Medici(DeVito) who upon getting a newborn little baby elephant named ""Dumbo"" his fortunes start to change. As it is with the young elephant having cute big oversized ears a super talent is uncovered this young one can fly high! Soon this little animal becomes a flying entertainer as each shows sells out.Somewhat of a wild card is present when clever and cunning feel out dirty business guy V.A. Vandevere(Michael Keaton) enters the picture as he tries to strike deals with Max and go in the business of money making at the use of the big ears flyer only his intentions are more harm than good. Overall the picture is entertaining and fun with cute scenes watching this baby elephant fly with such big ears and the cast is in all pro form as the chemistry works and the film still sends a message like the classic that is love and connection is found things happen when one believes and it's okay to be different, well done live action take that soars high with fun loving entertainment.",Dumbo
14,Robert_duder,Surprisingly dry and misses the magic,6,10 May 2019,"I waited anxiously to see Dumbo. I'm actually a fan of these recent Disney live action rollouts because they're magnificently done and they're bringing classics to a new generation in a whole new way. The biggest problem with Dumbo is that it doesn't help up well as it is. If you watch the 1941 original, there is so much content in there that needs to change due to political correctness and such and there is a lot in there that doesn't translate well to live action either. Overall the story just felt really dry to me. There was nothing particularly exciting or different or anything that stood out to make it unique. The performances were fine. Collin Farrell did a good job and the children were both very good and Eva Green was decent. Michael Keaton who I think is amazing, he's one of my favorite actors, overplayed his role quite a bit. He was supposed to be the villain but he was campy and over the top which was sort of the point and yet it didn't really work in the context of this film I didn't think. Danny Devito was very good as the ringmaster Medici who had one of the most interesting characters in the film. The special effects were good and yet you knew what to expect from the movie. You know he's going to fly and so even that isn't exactly a stunning revelation. I did have a lot of expectations for this going in and I just felt like it didn't really meet them very well. The direction was good and the sets were brilliant to see but the story and script lacked true heart and it didn't move me the way I expected from the trailers. It ended up being okay at best and I was disappointed when all was said and done. 6/10",Dumbo
15,ElMaruecan82,Timeless classics and timely trends....,5,31 March 2019,"Remaking, retelling, rebooting, rewriting... I used to believe that our era sealed the death of imagination, I forgot the basics of economics: supply influences demand and vice versa. So maybe we deserve an abomination like Tim Burton's ""Dumbo"". Producers lack imagination because we're not craving for originality, we love to see pre-established characters, familiar universes, only with a few twists in the story. There used to be a Golden Age of Hollywood, then TV, now it's the Golden Age of series, TV series, movie series and series of movies series.So why such an immortal and simple classic of Walt Disney's Golden Age called for a modernization 'à la sauce 2010's'? Maybe because they felt there was a significance in that story to which today's kids could relate to, ""how to accept yourself despite your flaws"" or ""how to learn to fly with your own wings"" or ""how to succeed by being a sweet and gentle person""... or maybe because there is big money in trends (and that's why they're trends). I hate to be cynical but after watching the film, I know now that whoever validated the final script cared for Dumbo exactly the same way the circus managers did: a phenomenon whose plus-size ears will attract the crowds. And from what I gathered from the box office grosses, they were right to think so.Could they fail anyway, with a logo like Disney's, a name like Tim Burton, special effects and the legacy of the original? The whole tragic irony is that they're not even quality-markers, they only guarantee a good cinematic cash-cow. Dumbo is one of the cutest and most sympathetic Disney protagonists but that had no bearing in box office results since people went to see ""Maleficent"" as well. And I guess this is why they didn't care about Dumbo's legacy anyway, they knew they had a movie manufactured to please the crowds, and it's very telling that the spectators in the film are all shown like Pavlovian sheep only capable to laugh, clap, boo, gasp or even laugh in unison.In the classic, Dumbo was mocked by The Elephant Matriarch and a few followers then he was bullied by the bratty kid, here the audience is like a uniform mass only used to enhance that self-congratulatory sense of grandeur, that's how we're perceived and are we proving them wrong? It's even more insulting because the film's capable of acknowledging individualism, of course for the sake of another trend. Now, whenever there's a Disney movie, I expect some young female misunderstood outcast with a ""dream of her own"" but with Miss Thandie Newton Jr. takes the cake. The film lost me the minute I saw her welcoming her dad (Colin Farrell).Seriously, this is a girl who has lost her mother, who didn't see her enlisted father for two years, she sees him without an arm lost in some WWI battle and yet she had to pose like Wednesday Addams and whenever she can, has to say ""Mom knew how to..."" as if she was blaming her father for having killed the Archduke. Naturally, to keep the right balance, the young brother is dumber and too likable to be interesting but that's part of the trend. The film isn't about Dumbo, the film doesn't even care about Dumbo, it cares about the message, so the Dumbo's arc is wrapped up in less than fifteen minutes, we have the incident with Mrs. Jumbo, the ""Baby Mine"" sequence (supposed to be an emotional highlight but significantly shortened) and then we have the discovery of his capability to fly and the equivalent of the original's climax,.The original film is only Act One. Why not? But it's quite a challenge to introduce new important characters after the story has taken off, Michael Keaton plays a sort of Disney-like visionary tycoon who invented in 1919 new attraction park and wants Dumbo, Eva Green is Colette Marchand the trapeze artist whose sole purpose is obviously to be the love interest of Colin Farrell. And as if it tried to make amends for that bit of old-fashionness, the film had to feature one of the most awkward and cringe-worthy visions of recent times: it's one thing to preach equality but God help me, I can't get off my head these two creepy blonde mannequins: the man making coffee dressed in women's suit and the woman dressed in male business suit smoking and drying her hair.It's called the Progress Carrousel or something like that and it would have been a terrific ""joke"" like the Simpsons' ""Electric Car of the Future"" but a joke, it's not. Disney's doesn't even make it subliminal anymore. Where is subtlety? Where is personality? Probably floating in a limbo between selfishness disguised as empowerment and mass-reactions negating the individual, Dumbo pleases the masses and empower a girl, it's not about him achieving his potential with the disinterested coaching of Timothy, it's just about achieving ""your"" dreams. ""Dreamland"" is the materialization of such ideas and it could have passed as a gutsy attack against Disney' capitalism if it wasn't wrapped up in a rushed up climax so full of lazy points and contrivances. Even the beautiful moment where Colette is riding on a flying Dumbo is only part of the climactic montage, even the demise of the villain is just senseless because his motives didn't make sense, if he wanted Dumbo to perform well, why deciding to kill the mother?So I didn't expect the animals to talk, I didn't expect the storks and certainly not the crows, I didn't even expect the iconic ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence (because of the alcoholic implication)... but the film flies over whatever made the story a timeless classic because it made a film relevant for its time, that's our problem, that's cinema's problem, making money out of superficial relevance.",Dumbo
16,ThomasDrufke,Lacks the Disney Magic But More Good Than Bad,6,17 April 2019,"What's funny about this iteration of Dumbo is that it's essentially Disney commenting on their business approach and the fact that sometimes their big corporate structure can overtake something small and nice, hence Michael Keaton's plan for Danny Devito's circus in this movie. Does this follow along with the good live action remakes of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Jungle Book? Or does it fall in the Maleficent/Pete's Dragon party? I think it's somewhere in the middle. It's very much a Tim Burton film, and if that's something you generally like, then you'll likely enjoy this interpretation. But if your someone who gets tired of all of his quirks and over the top written characters, then I doubt Dumbo will be for you. But hey, Eva Green and Dumbo himself were more than good enough for the price of admission. Everyone else? Not so much.6.3/10",Dumbo
17,tabuno,An Engaging Family Drama for Children,9,31 March 2019,"George Clooney's Tomorrowland (2015) has arrived in more than one way. Firstly, the special effects technology of tomorrow has arrived today and developed sufficiently to offer the audience a seamless experience of animated animals and razzmatazz to engage with the audience without ever appearing to be obviously special effects. The audience can immerse themselves in both the live action performances, the natural setting, and the script without ever having to become distracted by technology. CGI has finally found its proper place, as an amazing background to the greatly enhance production of the story itself. Secondly, the darker themes presented to the audience makes this a wonderful family fantasy drama for young children that Tomorrowland offered its young adult audience in a science fiction format. The story is pungent with themes of loss, including references to the flu epidemic of 1919, about relationships between parents and children, about corporate greed and animal abuse, and personally begins in Sarasota, Florida where I spent several months at New College in my late teens many years ago. Perhaps the only dissonance that possibly occurs during this movie is Michael Keaton's casting as Vandavere whose personality is sublimely, elegantly rough and coarse. These universal themes resonate even today, perhaps, even more so as our current civilization has forgotten the epidemic tragedies of the past that could so easily sweep up against us again or how we can cope when something really important is torn away from us, and the importance of acknowledging the old and new connections between people and family. This emotionally infused movie is delightful, exciting, and a worthy contribution to the stable of films.",Dumbo
18,ironhorse_iv,No! I'm not drunk & seeing pink elephants. I'm serious. I like this remake. It's a Guilty Pleasure.,7,29 May 2019,"From all the recent Walt Disney live action remakes of their classic animation films as of this writing; this one directed by Tim Burton is perhaps my favorite. I really did enjoyed this motion picture loosely based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson. This flick was not a shot for shot remake of the 1941 animation film of the same name at all. It gave us something new with the story. Instead of slow burn focusing only on Dumbo's conflict of being an outcast within the circus because of his big ears. This motion picture written by Ehren Kruger solve that quickly by tighten the pace revealing Dumbo ability to fly early in the first act. It's in the second part that the film's true conflicts center on cruel people trying to exploit Dumbo's talent. Because of that, it made watching this movie a unique and interesting watch. The plot wasn't simpleton. It had some complex subplots that I kinda dig such as World War I amputee & ex-equestrian performer Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) having to deal with the loss of his circus job, his wife & his working arm, while managing a social family connection with his children, Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins). Colin was fine actor in this. You really do see the depth and struggles his character has to go through. The kids not so much. They were a bit wooden and dull in their performances. Despite that I like how at least in this version, there is more genuinely kind circus workers like them. Nearly all the human characters in the original were awful avaricious antagonistic creatures. As for the villains in this remake. Rufus Sorghum played by Phil Zimmerman was somewhat stereotypical weak. However, I did like was the cryptic jab from Burton and Kruger on their employer. Like the clowns in the original movie representing the picketers during the 1941 animator strike. In this film, fictional theme park businessman V.A Vandevere (Michael Keaton) could be seen as the dark side of Walt Disney, a greedy cold entrepreneur who indifferent to the wellbeing of his workers. Keaton did a hell of a job showing that. By far, the sequences in Dreamland and him are the best thing about this movie. Eva Green as V.A's love interest, French trapeze Colette Marchant was not. The over the top snobby French accent was too much. Sadly, also Colin and Eva don't share much chemistry whenever they are put together nor with the kids. Because of that, the whole heel to face turn toward the end didn't seem believable. The love story between them felt kinda rushed. I also didn't like how her character treat Dumbo for most of the film by kicking and jumping on him kinda rough. There was barely any sign of care for the elephant. . I really wanted Colette to fall to her death. Such an unlikeable character. Despite that, I do like the social commentary about the issues of using wild animals in entertainment. Maybe they do belong in the wild. The new ending involving Dumbo going back to Asia is such a better climax than the original movie which had the elephant continue to work for people exploiting his talent. Nevertheless, one thing that this remake doesn't do a good job on is comedy. Jokes involving a circus monkey bothering supporting character, Max Medici (Danny DeVito) came across as frightening rather than funny. Regardless DeVito does do a good scrappy performance as the ringmaster. Much better than Michael Buffer appearing as the ringmaster at Dreamland. That cameo was jarring. Still, I would had rather have Timothy the mouse in this rather than that awful monkey. As for the CGI, it works even if some of the background atmospherically visuals are highly dark & creepy for younger audiences like the Pink Elephants on Parade. This movie still had enough cute and bright stuff to look at. I love how Dumbo's expressions are expressed through body language & facial. Without any talking animal dialogue, it still easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions especially during putting out the fire scene. Another thing due to the elimination of original talking animal characters like the highly offensive controversial racially insensitive Sambo like black crows that taught Dumbo how to fly from the first movie; catchy songs like 'When I see an Elephant Fly' were omitted until the end of the closing credits. Regardless of that, I still like Arcade Fire & Sharon Rooney cover of 'Baby of Mine' throughout the film. Even Aurora's version from the trailer was fine as well. As for the other songs from the 1941 version like 'Casey Junior is back' and 'Look Out for Mr. Stork', they weren't really needed due to the realistic tone. In its place of, Danny Elfman's score was well done. It was magically. Overall: While live action Dumbo fails to reach the lofty heights of its animated predecessor. I still believe the film is watchable for those willing to shell the expensive high movie theater ticket price. For me, it pass with flying colors. So do yourself a favor and check it out. Hopefully, you will enjoy it as much as my family and I did.",Dumbo

22,cruise01,Cute and charming story that brings the lovable Dumbo onto the big screen.,8,30 March 2019,"Dumbo (4 out of 5 stars).Dumbo is a cute fantasy adventure film that brings Disney's flying elephant onto the big screen. Tim Burton brings this Disney classic onto the big screen with some creative colorful visual direction, a sweet and charming story, and a talented cast. And yes, the flying baby elephant does have some cuteness that adults and children will enjoy. Even though, Dumbo is mostly cgi. The film may be loosely based on the classic animated movie. But still pure enjoyment.The plot follows the Medici Brothers circus runned by Max (Danny DeVito). His circus is slowly running to the ground and they are cutting back for budget reasons. With World War I veteran Holt (Colin Farrell) returning back to the circus and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins). Max has Holt being in charged with the elephants. When one Elephant gives birth to Dumbo who has large ears that everyone makes fun of. But what they do not know is Dumbo has the capabilities of flying using his ears.It does have a cute plot. It has a story about a Veteran Holt who is trying to get along with his children. With feeling grief about the passing of his wife from some sickness. And that she always knew what to do with helping their own children. And the kids feeling like their father is having trouble finding his way back to them. While the circus they are travelling with is struggling on money and the owner is selling as much as he can to make money and hoping they can create some better acts. When Dumbo steals the show and gets noticed by a shady amusement park owner V.A. (Michael Keaton). Who tries to get Max to contract with him. And V.A. taking full control of Dumbo shows by having his girlfriend Colette (Eva Green) who is a trapeze artists perform with the elephant and ride him as he flies.The set designs, the visual effects, music score by Danny Elfman, and Tim Burton's direction was all worth looking at. Definitely one of his better films over the last several years. Set designs with the amusement park Dreamland looked fantastic. The visual effects were good. And the music score is beautiful and Elfman's noticeable work.Colin Farrell was good playing Holt. Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker were good too. Danny DeVito was a lot of fun. Eva Green is beautiful and gives a likable performance. Michael Keaton plays a shady character very well.The film's third act does pick up with some action of Holt and his circus band trying to help and free Dumbo from Dreamland.Overall, Dumbo is a good film. Kids and adults will enjoy the film. It may not be close to the animated film but close enough. Tim Burton's direction, cast, the set design, and music score was worth it. May not be the best exciting film but it has a cute story.",Dumbo
23,eddie_baggins,A dull dose of Burton magic,5,2 April 2019,"If 15 years ago it was announced that famed director and imaginative soul Tim Burton was going to be helming a modern day remake of beloved Disney animation classic Dumbo, you'd think that the film world would've been counting down the days until the film was released.Fast forward to 2019 and the story is a whole lot different, as let's not beat around the circus marquee, Tim Burton has lost his creative spark and mojo sometime ago and sadly, Dumbo isn't the film to magically bring it back.It's a story that certainly fits the Burton M.O to a tee.Magic, circuses, over the top villains, Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton (in a rather forgettable Batman reunion) and a sense of wonder and imagination, but in his current state of affairs, Dumbo is all the things that have been wrong about most of Burton's more recent offerings, meaning the film isn't intolerable, but it's all types of forgettable.Disney would want to hope that this is a one off, with other live action remakes in the form of Aladdin and The Lion King coming our way before we know it, as poor old big eared Dumbo is such a by the numbers affair, devoid of any real magic, that it makes you wonder if it would've been a better choice to just re-watch the much more streamlined and emotionally resonate animation for the umpteenth time.Burton's film isn't devoid of moments of solid family orientated entertainment, scenes involving Dumbo taking to the skies will bring a smile to your face, Dumbo himself is a cute CGI creation, while some of the films sets and visuals are as good as you'd hope to get from a film with a $160 million production budget but there's just a lack of real heart or spark here to make the film take to the skies like its protagonist.This is just a sad continuation on from the Burton of old who since the success of Big Fish in 2003 has delivered such forgettable affairs as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Alice in Wonderland, Dark Shadows, Big Eyes and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and while some of these films have been financial successes, Burton's career phase where he seems determined to tackle beloved properties, have found the filmmaker struggling to give a soul to his well-financed escapades, a problem that many of his earlier film's never had and a reason why so many feel in love with the filmmaker in the first place.Not even the presence of likeable performers like Colin Farrell (in a rather thankless one-armed role as cowboy star Holt Farrier), Burton's new muse Eva Green or the aforementioned Keaton or DeVito can do much to save Dumbo from a sense of mediocrity, although what else can you expect when they're working off a script by the same screenwriter responsible for three separate Transformers films and the ghastly Ghost In the Shell.Final Say -There's little moments of joy to be found in Dumbo but this padded out and mostly lethargic re-imagining of the adored animation is so forgettable and uninspired, you wonder why anyone even bothered, making this yet another stale entry into the increasingly dwindling returns of its director Tim Burton's C.V.2 ½ peanuts out of 5",Dumbo
24,leonblackwood,Looks great but the storyline was dull! 4/10,4,16 January 2020,"Review:
Although this movie looked great, I found it to be quite dull and depressing in parts. Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito added a touch of wit to the film, but I struggled to find it entertaining. I wasn't a big fan of the original, so my expectations weren't that high, and the fact that Tim Burton stuck to the original concept, I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. With all of the live adaptations of the Disney movies nowadays, a lot of the directors are relying on CGI to bring the magic back to screen, and in terms of the look of this film, it certainly did work. With that aside, I did fall asleep a couple of times because it all seemed a bit too safe. I did find some of the scenes emotional, and the extravagant sets were impressive, but it wasn't enough to keep me entertained. Colin Farrell put in a decent performance, and I was surprised to see Eva Green play a goodie for once, but the kids became a bit annoying after a while. If you're not familiar with the storyline, it's set in 1919, were an equestrian performer and World War I amputee, Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns after the war to the Medici Brothers Circus, run by Maxi Medici (Danny DeVito). The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici had to sell the circus horses after Holt's wife and co-performer, Annie, dies from the Spanish flu, so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus pregnant Asian elephant, Mrs. Jumbo. Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf. However, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance in Joplin Missouri, and the crowd laugh and mockingly names the calf Dumbo while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo, horrified and enraged by her son's mistreatment, rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally collapsing the big top, which results in the death of an abusive handler. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici resorts to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt's son and daughter, Joe and Milly, comfort Dumbo and discover that he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly. In another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes awry, and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly delivers a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flies, and word of his talent begins to spread. V.A. Vandevere, the entrepreneur and owner of a bohemian amusement park called Dreamland in New York City, approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration, were Medici would become Vandevere's partner and the Medici Brothers Circus troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland. Colette and Dumbo's debut performance at Dreamland goes awry with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since there is no safety net. Dumbo hears his mother's call in response and realises that his mother is in an exhibit (Nightmare Island) elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother, which leads to the disappoint of the audience. Fearing that Mrs. Jumbo may become a distraction to him and ruin his reputation, Vandevere orders her to be terminated. Vandevere also fires all the Medici performers from Dreamland. When Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn that Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo's mother and it's no longer safe for the two elephants to live with them, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. Will the performers save Jumbo and Dumbo from the evil Vandevere? You have to watch the film to find out! Although it's a touching story for all ages, there's nothing really upbeat about the film, and there isn't much depth to the characters. I liked the facial expressions from Dumbo, and the fact that it could show how it was feeling through his eyes but I can't see myself watching it again in a hurry. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Tim Burton, who also brought you Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985, Beetlejuice in 1988, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Ed Wood, Conversations With Vincent, Mars Attacks!, Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Corpse Bride, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland, Dark Shadows, Frankenweenie, Big Eyes and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, which also starred Eva Green. It's been rumoured that he would be directing another Beetlejuice movie, but I doubt that it will have the same magic as the original film did. He's known for his collaborations with Johnny Depp, who can't seem to star in a decent film without him, so it's obvious that their chemistry works on film. He is definitely a unique director, whose dark and warped sense of humour usually works on screen, but he played it safe with this project, which didn't go down to well with the critics. It still made a profit at the box office, which is a plus, and I doubt that it will tarnish his reputation, but it won't go down as an all-time classic.Budget: $170million

25,TheMovieDiorama,Dumbo joyfully takes flight in this bloated re-imagining.,6,30 March 2019,"Disney's original animation, whilst groundbreaking during its initial release, contained too many outdated elements that hindered its overall timelessness. And if you strongly disagree with me, I highly recommend you revisit it and you'll hopefully know what I mean. Now during the height of live action adaptations, the ""House of Mouse"" recruit their favourite gothic director (and all his eccentricities) to bring the magic of belief back onto the big screen. Suffice to say, it's as safe as you expected it to be, given the results of 'Alice in Wonderland', but an enjoyable flick for the entire family. A baby elephant in a travelling circus discovers the ability to fly by using his abnormally giant ears. Word of mouth spreads and he is soon contracted, along with other performances, to perform at Dreamland (the equivalent of Disneyland).The original had issues. It was not perfect in the slightest. Dumbo's central plot characteristic is only explored in the last seven minutes, the drunken scene, unmemorable music and the crows. Surprisingly, Burton resolves these issues. He condenses the animation's seventy minute runtime into the first thirty minutes of this film, allowing Dumbo's flying ability to be explored almost immediately. The drunken scene is substituted for a vivid performance involving bubbles, and don't worry the ""Pink Elephants"" sequence is still included. The crows are non-existent and this adaptation rarely focuses on its musical influence.However in doing so, Burton has created new problems for himself. The original's core message of self-belief and accepting one's abnormalities are somewhat lost within Burton's lavish production. Instead, he has re-imagined the message to ironically tackle corporate greed and the negative connotations of monopolising the entertainment industry. It's a different route to say the least, not particularly fresh and inventive but it's accessible for a range of audiences. The main problem is the screenplay. The characters, despite acquiring some colourful attire, were abhorrently dull and one-dimensional. This would be fine if Dumbo was the predominant character consuming most of the screen time, however arguably he is not.The addition of these human characters, whilst needed to force the story to be grounded in realism, were badly executed. The children especially simply describe the plot just because Dumbo can't, including how the adorable elephant is feeling. This spoon-feeding narrative made the story feel sluggish, and at a bloated runtime totalling at over two hours, it introduced inconsistent pacing. Due to that extensive runtime, several scenes felt repetitive and acted as filler. The performances were all fine (although nothing to write home about) but Dumbo himself stole the show. Absolutely. Utterly. Absurdly. Adorable. Just look at him! Urgh, just want to stroke his trunk and ride him...ummm right, anyway!Burton's exciting set pieces and eye for gorgeous production value enable that famous Disney magic to come bursting off the screen. And, for better or worse, his re-imagined version of this classic story does have several entertaining moments of pure wonder and joy that prevents it from being bad. In fact, I rather enjoyed the film as a whole. It's just an incredibly safe, predictable and one-dimensional approach for Burton, which occasionally forces Dumbo to fall from grace.",Dumbo
26,digitalbeachbum,The Cartoon Had More Life,1,8 January 2021,"The 1941 version was better, not for the technical aspect, but for the script and heart. This movie has nothing to do about Dumbo and more about the people who controlled him. There was no heart and no life in the script. There was no reason for the people to dominate the screen. Where is the story about Dumbo?The snorting of the feather up his snout was wrong. The lack of the mouse was acceptable. The idea that the evil owner of Dreamland was wrong. The entire movie had a misdirect of the actual story, a baby elephant who loses his mother, learns to fly because he likes the feather which gives him confidence, but in reality he doesn't need the feather because it is only a crutch.The lack of a mouse isn't really needed, but I'm guessing they were trying to depart from the old story and not have to deal with another voice and computer generated creature. This is because they wanted to cut costs, but you could still have Dumbo and get rid of all these voice actors. You really don't need any of them for Dumbo.A waste of time, energy and resources. I'm glad I didn't pay for this pile of garbage.",Dumbo
27,matthewssilverhammer,I Be Done Seen 'Bout Everything When I See a Worthwhile Dumbo Remake,8,6 April 2019,"Burton has spent 30+ years making films about wonderful weirdos. As one himself, he's learned that the people who truly love you don't decry your ""flaws"" but recognize them as your own unique superpower, and even his worst films worked to support this. With Dumbo, his best film in a decade, he takes it a step further, using his trademark pop-gothic visuals and themes to argue that people who exploit your uniqueness (including Disney itself) are just as bad as (or worse than) those who simply shame you.
In this iteration, the titular character and his animal cohorts take a slight backseat to the human circus workers, who are dealing with newfound success because of their elevating elephant friend, when a theme park mogul (Keaton) buys them out. The new story is supported by a surprisingly strong script (excusing the flat jokes) that doesn't so much remake or even flesh out the original film so much as make something completely different.
As with all Burton films, the sets are wonderfully extravagant (how has he never made a circus movie before??), the characters are reliably simple, and the shadowy darkness and gloom is punctured with brilliant bursts of color and pure joy.
With Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, ABC, ESPN, etc, we all live at the entertainment mercy of the Disney company, and while that near-monopoly can be disheartening, it could be a lot worse. Still, it's nice that Burton spends time here lightly criticizing this fact. Hypocritical? Maybe. And while Dumbo isn't quite as charmingly great as the original (or as racist), it's a sweet and exciting twist on the classic that shows plenty of soul and admiration without being panderingly reverent.",Dumbo

When his kids witness an elephant giving birth to a baby elephant,they are both shocked that the baby was born with big ears,resulting in the elephant to be made fun of at the circus when he gets older. However when an evil businessman named V. A Vandervere(Keaton) wants to take over the circus,can Holt,Mike(DeVito) and Holt's kids save both Dumbo and his mother?What I loved about this remake was it wasn't a beat by beat like say Beauty and the beast or Cinderella,and the visuals was very good. The acting was great,Colin Farrell was great with his Southern accent(his from Dublin in real life) and Devito was great too as always. Micheal Keaton was grand as the villian,he had this Joker vibe about him and this toupee.

Disney has been turning a lot of their animated films into live action and I was scared, like everyone else, that they would ruin Dumbo in the process. I was wrong.
Techically the first 6 to 12 mins of the film was actually a live action adaption of Dumbo, then what they did was add a new element to the story, this time getting humans more involved with Dumbo.

The original was a short, cute Disney animated feature with a minimalist story but engaging imagery and some good songs. The remake forgoes much of what made the 1941 film charming, and instead offers up a moralistic 'capitalism is bad' story, a bunch of uninteresting human stereotypes, and a predictable attempt to superimpose modern sensibilities on a depression-era film. The film also perpetuates the pernicious myth that animals raised in captivity would thrive if simply returned to the wild (i.e. without training and a controlled transition). I usually like Tim Burton's style but his dark imagery seemed out of place with the lightweight story: the film would have been better if the live-action look had matched the cheerful surrealism of the original...and I missed the singing crows.",Dumbo

The storyline follows a baby circus elephant with abnormally big ears in a circus that is starting to die out due to a lack of audiences and popularity. With a little magic and confidence that elephant can not only emerge confidently but steal, and save, the show. This movie is directed by Tim Burton (Nightmare before Christmas) and stars Colin Farrell (SWAT), Michael Keaton (Birdman), Danny DeVito (Batman Returns) and Eva Green (Casino Royale). The storyline for this was fun and the animation was outstanding. The ending was a bit off and too much compared to the original animated film, but it was entertaining and the elements were enjoyable, especially for children.

This live action movie is based loosely on the 1941 animated Disney classic and it is directed by Tim Burton. It's set in 1919, right after the end of WW 1. Colin is returning from the war to try and reconnect with his old job at the circus that is run by Danny. Colin lost one of his arms in the war and his wife back home-she died of an illness-so he needs a job. His 2 kids have been taken care of by Danny and the rest of the circus people but his old job is gone and the only job opening is working with the elephants. One of the elephants is pregnant and when it is born-with enormous ears-it is made fun of. The circus is struggling but when they discover that Dumbo-the baby elephant with big ears-can fly, things start to look better. FYI: You do learn how Dumbo gets his name. Michael is the owner of a futuristic amusement park-kind of like Disneyland-and he sees dollar signs concerning Dumbo and merges with Danny's circus. Eva plays a trapeze artist working for Michael and Michael wants her to ride Dumbo when he is flying, as his new act. There is a couple of cameos that seem like they were done as a favor to Mr Burton-they weren't really needed but the one with Michael Buffer-'Let's Get Ready to Rumble!'-was funny.
It's rated ""PG"" for peril/action and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes.
I'm not a big Disney fan-unlike my wife-and I thought it was a little slow in parts, but it was entertaining seeing Dumbo fly. I wouldn't buy this movie on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Dumbo

There are more than a few changes made to the beloved 1940 classic. This time out, the focus is more on how the title character's physics-defying abilities affect the humans around him. ""Dumbo"" also has a darker overtone . I rather enjoyed the twist. As you would expect from a Burton production, this is a visual knockout. Dumbo is about the cutest pixelated creature you're likely to see, and he's a wonder to behold. Yet it's the reaction of the marginalized characters to his amazing feats that are the key to the film. When Dumbo soars, they soar with him his success is their success as he defies everyone's preconceptions of him by simply believing in himself.",Dumbo
37,alindsay-al,A Below Average Mixed Film,4,23 April 2019,"This is another of the new live action Disney animated films and I have to be honest this is easily my least favourite to date. The premise of the film sees an ugly elephant find his place in a circus when it is revealed that it can fly. Colin Farrell plays the lead in this film and he is okay, he has a great screen presence in this film and does feel like a leading man. However, his character was pretty bland in the film and didn't provide that much depth to the film. Alos I didn't feel like Dumbo had much of a character so that was definitley a disappointing aspect of the film. The supporting cast is a mixed bag, the one highlight is Danny Devito who plays a fun part in the film, he is the one person who feels very natural in their role. Michael Keaton plays the antagonist in the film and wow he is so over the top that it is just plain bad. He is a complete cartoon in this film, which is so disappointing as he is a fantastic actor but was given nothing to work with. Eva Green plays his girlfriend in the film and she has this really distracting French accent that took me out of the film, she once again tries but is given very little to work with. I also didn't really care about the children in the film, I felt especially the girl acts like she is better then every other character in the film but came across as a bit whiny. The story is very underwhelming, it just has very little to it and is pretty bland and generic. I didn't really care about any of the characters or their plight so it definitley affected the overall film. The script had some chuckle worthy moments that will put a smile on your face, but the drama just really didn't hit for me, so when the characters are trying to build emotion I just didn't care. The style has some impressive visual effects and seeing Dumbo fly is pretty cool. But the problem is that once you have seen Dumbo fly it is never as cool to see it again, this really hurts the film as it can never reach the heights visually that it needs to. Also Tim Burton uses his usual style but I felt it didn't mesh very well with the film and caused a mix of tones. Overall this was a disappointing film but I hope Aladdin & The Lion King are much better then this film.",Dumbo
38,CubsandCulture,"""This is a disaster"" Couldn't agree more character I have no idea why you are in the film...",3,31 March 2019,"This is one of the few films I would describe as self-loathing. I honestly don't know what to make of some of the choices the creative team makes. What do you make of a Disney film in which the villain is a Walt Disney stand-in? Keaton's character is puzzling and needlessly complicates the plot. What to make of a film centered on a circus that seems to hate circuses? Burton has always had a lot of obsessions and (too) personal touches in his films. But the way the camera here lingers on certain sets is garish and obsessive to the point of being kitsch. Garish is a good word for this film. It's chock full of unneeded details, forced whimsy, and bizarre sidebars such that the film simply doesn't form a singular entity.It is part the original Dumbo tale, weirdly sanitized (the crows don't show up, pink elephants is greatly reworked in an incomprehensible way). Worse the story idea of the feather(s) helping Dumbo learn to fly is treated almost like a drug addiction (!!!). It is part family melodrama but without a real clear sense of what the family members means to each other. It is part backstage politics but without a clear sense of why the material is added into the story. It is part self-critique in that the film seems vaguely aware it is started as a soulless money grab yet the film exists as a soulless money grab.I can't say I was entertained by this film. I have no idea what kids will make of it. But it was engrossing in a trainwreck kind of way. Might be a cult film in 20 years.

So that's worth bearing in mind.2019's 'Dumbo' surpasses the '41 film with ease, it's admittedly a low bar. There's actually a storyline to this one which is pleasing, while the live-action nature really helps suck me into believing in the - obviously ludicrous - plot. With that noted, it isn't perfect. The pacing is off, while the antagonists are a bit irritating - if suitably cast.As for the protagonist, Colin Farrell plays his role nicely. Danny DeVito is an obvious but excellent cast for Max Medici, while Michael Keaton and Eva Green suit their roles. Amusing cameo from Michael Buffer too, by the way. As for the kid actors, not great... There is no real human appearance in the first film, so this one had to create one from scratch and I think they did a good job.Dumbo is super cute, just as before, and his story is undoubtedly hearty; which are arguably the only things that the 40s film did right.Overall, I liked this remake.",Dumbo

44,aidanratesmovies,"Entertaining, but lacking adaptation",7,29 March 2019,"Dumbo obviously misses the mark on more than a few occasions, but that isn't to say it doesn't have its moments. Besides being pretty entertaining, Dumbo the character itself it beautifully utilized to pull at your heartstrings and the cgi is done quite well, along with the cgi of many other animal characters. The acting, goes without saying, is where much of the films flaws lie, as well as the script. Michael Keaton, shockingly, gives the worst performance in the star studded cast, as a obvious substitute for a non present Johnny Depp. Colin Farrell's performance is fine, and he does the best with the material he is given, but most of his material seems quite out of place. The main kids in the film give pretty good performances, and Danny Devito is somehow the overall standout. Tim Burton gives his signature flair and look to the film, providing it with some beautiful and fun visuals. Unfortunately though, the script is messy, average, and seemingly half baked, all things opposing the obvious we-like feeling the film is going for. In the end, Dumbo is certainly not a bad film, but it's obviously a thought to ponder how more magical the film would have been if it wouldn't have changed its plot so drastically from the original. Dumbo doesn't quite soar as high as it wants to, and isn't as fresh as it thinks it is, but it is an entertaining ride, and provides just the right amount of emotion and setup for you to care about just what you came here for; a magical flying elephant.

48,davidmvining,"A movie about how Disney is terrible, funded and distributed by Disney",7,25 November 2019,"I think it's really funny that Tim Burton made a movie about how much he hates Disney, and he got Disney to produce and distribute it. I don't know how else to read the subtext of this film.Following in the drunken footsteps of Beauty and the Beast, The Jungle Book, Cinderella, and others, Disney decided that it was going to make a live-action remake of another of their classics: Dumbo, the movie from the 40s that's a grand 60 minutes long. Tim Burton previously made a live action sequel to Alice in Wonderland, and he got the job.Well, the new version is largely a remake for the first half. Timothy Q. Mouse is largely gone, replaced by a pair of children. In addition, the children have a father. I knew that there was something a bit more about this movie the first time we saw Colin Farrell in this film. I had seen very little promotional material of the film, so I don't know if the ads gave this away, but the father has just come back from The Great War with only one arm. Burton has always been drawn towards broken characters (the unfinished Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Sweeney Todd, for example), so it doesn't surprise me that Dumbo contains one. However, there's something very tangible and relatable about a broken man coming home broken because of World War I. I loved that detail.Well, the circus he returns to has just purchased a pregnant elephant, and the baby ends up having those large floppy ears. Mother and son are separated, Dumbo learns to fly, and he exhibits his talent for the public in a stunt involving a fake burning building. So, yeah, it's the original Dumbo, with some modifications, for the first 50 minutes. And then, the movie keeps going.The scrappy little circus is suddenly the focus of the owner of a large stationary circus called Dreamland. Everything about the place is fake, but he wows the small circus owner and gang into thinking they are entering a new world of incredible possibilities. It's this thirty minutes or so of the film, as the small circus gets integrated into the big one, that I kind of completely love. It's brimming with the subtext where the circus is Burton and Dreamland is Disney. With that in mind, it seems obvious that Burton hates working with Disney, and he chose to make a Disney movie to show it. The irony is fantastic. And it's also where the movie works best as a movie.The troupe of freaks, artists, and the rest are taken in completely by the spectacle of Dreamland. They are introduced to a trapeze artist whom Vandevere (Dreamland's owner) found as a street performer in Paris. The relationship between Vandevere and Colette, the trapeze artist, seems real when first introduced, but we quickly see that it's a façade and that the two see each other in little more than business terms. It also becomes obvious that Vandevere bought the whole circus only to get Dumbo, he's going to dump the rest the first second he can, stripping the failing little circus of the one thing that was going to save it.As the final act begins the form, the movie gets a bit more confused and its issues become a bit more apparent. I began to feel a bit overwhelmed because there wasn't a strong enough character to anchor everything onto. It became a flurry of action without any real strong narrative hook for everything. Who's the main character? I began to ask. It's certainly not Dumbo, he's too passive and too much in the sidelines for long stretches of the movie. Is it Medici, the owner of the small circus? Farrell? The kids? Colette? None are quite prominent enough to be the main character and as a whole they're too defined by their individual goals to work as an ensemble. Still, I think the first act works pretty well and the second act is wonderful. It's just let down by a third act that doesn't really know what to do with all of the threads it created for itself.Visually, the movie moves from fairly convincing to less so, a byproduct of simply using so much computer generated imagery that it's impossible to smooth out everything. It also has a very set bound feel (since it was actually entirely filmed on green screen sets) that gives a certain claustrophobic feeling to it, especially in the beginning when most of it is set outside (ironically). Performances are largely good (especially Farrell), but the children are rather stilted.It's a weak recommendation, in fact as the movie was ending I was considering knocking the rating from three stars to two-and-a-half, but that middle act worked so well for me that I'm going to keep this on the positive side of the recommendation line. It helps to have subtext sometimes.",Dumbo
49,jadepietro,More Sawdust Than Glitter,7,5 April 2019,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well crafted but heavy-handed reboot that never takes flight due to its overstuffed screenplay.JIM'S REVIEW: Before Tim Burton was an established filmmaker, he began his artistic journey as an animator for Walt Disney studios. That job did not last too long as he soon parted ways with the Mouse Factory due to his macabre tendencies which were not appropriate for the company's wholesome image. Where brings us to his latest film, Dumbo...The original 1941 animated film was a short (64 minutes) but sweet tale of a misfit overcoming adversity, a recurring theme in most of Mr. Burton's movies. What would appear to be a perfect match with artist and subject misfires a bit. The basic story remains, but too much tinkering with the plot and substituting additional supporting characters that have little or no interest seem to rob the film of its magic. With no Timothy Q. Mouse as Dumbo's conscience and voice in this version, the removal of most of the film's original songs, and numerous PETA influences that take this lovely period piece and align it with our politically correct sensibilities of today.The film is dark and moody. Tragedy engulfs its 1920's characters. Colin Farrell plays the lead human character, Holt Farrier, a WWI amputee, widow, and father of two tykes, Millie (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins). They befriend and take care of our little pachyderm with those big sky blue eyes and huge floppy ears. Also under the Big Top is its owner Max Medici, played with gusto by Danny DeVito. His circus is in dire financial straits and it's Dumbo and his flying skills to the rescue. However, it does bring a corrupt tycoon named V. A. Vandevere (a miscast Michael Keaton) who is ready to exploit our elephant hero and a beautiful aerialist named Colette (a bland Eva Green) into the story, doubling this movie's length and laboring its charm.The actors remain earthbound in their underwritten roles. Ehren Kruger overstuffs his script with unnecessary perils and never registers any emotional bond with any of the film's real-life characters. Some are played as pure caricatures or farcical villains while others appear to be by-products of the real world and all of its ominous trappings. As the film's director and cinematic ringmaster, Mr. Burton just does not rein in his three-ring circus as he should. (The film would have been more convincing and fun had it celebrated the original musical source, complete with its familiar songs, instead of becoming just another brash run-of-the-mill fantasy adventure overloaded with pop spectacle.)Yet, with most of Mr. Burton's films, the visual look of the movie supplies the awe. And again it is the production design that provides the needed razzle-dazzle. The CGI is top drawer and the details of our adorable title character are enchanting. (Except for some fleeting moments of aerial flight and the Pink Elephants on Parade bubble sequence, the film rarely captures that feeling of true enchantment for Dumbo and his moviegoing audience.) Ben Davis' photography is atmospheric, the masterful editing by Chris Lebenzon is very effective, and Danny Elfman's music delivers its own hidden virtues, even though it eliminates or reduces many of the memorable tunes from the original score to mere snippets of melody. But it is Rick Heinrichs' depiction of Dreamland, a wildly imaginative Art Deco amusement park that glorifies some of the magical memories of a circus world/ world's fair from times gone by.Dumbo (2019) loses some of its whimsy and glee in this adaptation. While the movie still entertains, this updated version is made of more artificial sawdust than genuine glitter.",Dumbo

This film looks at the story from a different angle.The center of this film is still the same but we are not as focused on Dumbo. We take a look at the world around him. We see him being made fun of and watch him breakthrough his self doubt but this shows a different way in how he learned he could fly.

51,martimusross,Too Dark And No Magic At All,5,30 March 2019,"At the start a film review must be about the art product before the reviewer to compare this movie to the original cartoon version is both irrelevant and indulgent.This film was a ravishing display of images and CGI and very much in the style of other Tim Burton films. The script was tight and we had great performances from Colin Farrell and Danny Devito who dominated their scenes and attempted to make a silk purse out of an elephant's ear.Overall is was a ok but there were a couple of problems with this movie and I think these do rest entirely with the director Tim Burton;1, there was an overall feeling of menace throughout, it was dark and overly dramatic which was at odds with a lovable flying baby elephant.2, everyone was mean to everyone without any apparent cause. The father was mean to the child, the children were mean to Dumbo, the ringmaster was cruel to everyone and the Michael Keaton and Alan Arkin characters were monsters incarnate. If we have bad we need to counterbalance this with some good.3, we had no humour whether in the dialogue or situational, indeed there were no funny sections in the whole movie and this contributed to it becoming as times both heavy, dreary and even tedious.4, Dumbo as a character was devoid of personality and on occasions his expressions were downright creepy, this movie is not really one for the children.5. The actress Nico Parker who played Millie Farrier was miscast, she was just too old and knowing for the role. Her range of acting skills just wasn't there, as Dorothy Parker said ""she ran the gamut of emotions from A to B"", mostly we were treated to a series of blank expressions that conveyed nothing. Also if they were meant to be brother and sister they needed to slightly resemble each other so this added a layer of confusion that was unnecessary.",Dumbo
52,Troy_Campbell,Devoid of splendour.,4,31 March 2019,"Spinning such a classic animated film into a live-action yarn is no easy feat. Stick too close to the source material and it becomes redundant, veer too far away and you risk losing the essence of what made the original a classic in the first place. Tim Burton takes on the unenviable job and, unfortunately, fails to deliver. This is not a bad movie by any means, in fact there are many positives to be found, but this remake commits one unforgivable sin that trumps all else: it's boring. There are the usual Burton eccentricities splashed across the screen - an old-school circus is ripe for his weirdness - yet even this seems to be well and truly on his safe side, the oddness of it all quickly becoming a pastiche of his previous work. One can't help and feel like of all the changes made from the 1941 masterpiece, and there are plenty, some dampen the fun more than others. Humans now fill out all of the supporting roles which has a double downside: first, there's no Timothy Q. Mouse as Dumbo's lovably rapscallion sidekick; second, the animals no longer talk, making it less about Dumbo and more about the rather bland kids who take him under their wing. The spectacle isn't what you would expect either. The CGI Dumbo is neither photorealistic enough to be convincing, nor exhilarating enough in full flight to get the pulse soaring. The big-bang finale only barely conjures up a slither of excitement. The familiar trappings put this squarely in the comfort zone of Burton fans, but this Dumbo retelling is plodding, bland and devoid of any memorable splendour.",Dumbo

54,jeremycrimsonfox,This Movie Should Be A Lesson On What Not To Do When Remaking A Film,1,6 October 2019,"Dumbo was a great animated classic film that is among those to get the live-action remake treatment that Disney is currently obsessed with, and while the thing is for the films to be close to the original as possible, this one strays too far from the original to the point where it is a circus disaster waiting to happen.One of the major flaws with this is getting rid of the talking animal characters in favor of focusing on humans. Thus, instead of Timothy Q. Mouse (who is reduced to a minor character at the start), we get two human kids who are basically generic and boring. Also, they changed the plot entirely where instead of Dumbo finding his purpose, to a cliché plot where the they have save Dumbo's mother from an evil circus. Why was this rewrite even necessary? The original script was good enough, and the other remakes basically followed the scripts of their original animated forms (hence with some modifications and additions), so why couldn't Dumbo be like that? This film should serve as a lesson on how not to remake a classic animated film as a live-action movie.",Dumbo

56,rockman182,Dumbo (2018),6,30 March 2019,"Disney live action remakes are somehow all the rage now. There are four that are coming out this year alone! Dumbo is the first to come to the big screen. I haven't seen the original because lets face it, a flying elephant with big ears isn't exactly something I'm jumping for. I kind of knew I wouldn't like this but I try to always go in with an open mind, and I like to think Tim Burton can pull a good one every now and then. Nope, nothing to see here.The film is about a circus elephant with big ears. Initially ridiculed and deemed worthless, it is soon discovered that Dumbo the elephant can actually fly when a feather is presented. He soon becomes a sensation but crooked carnival owners are intending to hurt his birth mother. It is up to a family performing in the circus to assist Dumbo and make sure no harm comes to his family. Tim Burton reunites with Eva Green again here. I'll watch anything with Eva.The film often has a nice Burton-esque look and feel to it but that's not nearly enough to save this film. Facing facts, this film is just boring. Parts of the film, mostly witht Dumbo flying around, is fun to watch. Overall though, the film feels so padded and stretched out. It did not need to be a near two hours long. It falls flat at many points and is perhaps the weakest live action Disney remake to date.The performances and visuals are ever present but the film lacks heart and just feels like its going through the motions. To me, this also felt like a dated affair. In 2019 I don't care for flying circus elephants (I haven't ever though to be honest). This may make for good family fun, for me though this was unnecessary and goes to show that Disney needs to pick and choose what to make a live remake of.5.5/10",Dumbo

58,RforFilm,"This technicolor pachyderm tries to soar, but Dumbo is filled with a jumbled and empty script that can't juggle",5,29 March 2019,"""I can stand the sight of worms, and look at microscopic germs, but Technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me!"" These lyrics come from the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" song from the animated Dumbo from Disney. It's a sequence clearly meant to stretch the time, but it's still an impressively drawn sequence that adds to the original film's charm. Dumbo may be an elephant version of Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer, it's still sweet and provides a nice morale about embracing what makes you different. There's a reason why despite being over seventy, Dumbo still soars with a lot of families.I guess it should have not come as a surprise that along with a lot of it's other animated classics, Dumbo was also slated to receive a live action adaptation. I'll admit that unlike Maleficent or Beauty and the Beast, I was genuinely interested for two reasons. First, the remake was going to be helmed by Tim Burton, who despite having a career slump, still remains one of the most imaginative visual directors in Hollywood. Second, I felt that due to the originals movie's length, more could be expanded upon. So does the new live action Dumbo soar?Set in 1918, the Medici Bros. Circus has hit fallen times due to WWI and an flu outbreak that has put ringmaster Max Medici (played by Danny DeVito) in a tough spot, along with his other circus performers who hope that the people will come back for entertainment. One performer returns from the war, a horse performer Holt Farrier (played by Colin Farrell) who has to fill in the role of father and mother to his two children Joe (played by Finley Hobbins) and Milly (played by Nico Parker). Though his horses were sold, he's given a chance to be the new elephant handler to which he accepts.One of the elephants, Mrs. Jumbo, gives birth to a baby who has unusually large ears. He's dismissed by the circus and audience as a freak, but Milly and Joe still look out for him. It doesn't take long to discover Dumbo's large ears give him the ability to fly, so they manage to put him in an act that makes him a star. A theme park owner, V.A. Vandevere (played by Michael Keaton) offers Max and his troupe to join his circus show, which he accepts. Though Dumbo now has a bigger audience, Milly and Joe can't help but question Vandevere while trying to find Mrs. Jumbo to reunite her son with her.I have to give Dumbo some credit for trying to recreate the animated movie while making the story different. I can say their clearly trying to do a whole lot, but unlike an ordinary circus that's planned, this is a storytelling mess that can't seem to juggle its act. If you're looking for the lovable flying elephant and his story as a star, it's definitely in there. The problem is that it's script tries to add so much to expand it's material, and yet very little neither adds to the classic or adds up at all.The script needed a rewrite. The movie starts out with the Dumbo story, which works fine, but has a lot of trouble afterword. The story with Colin Farrell being a performer is brought up...but never follows through. Danny DeVito's story as an aging circus owner is brought up...but never follows through. Michael Keaton's story as a ruthless entrepreneur is brought up...but never explored. Even the kids (who give very wooden performances) who are the closest to Dumbo never really feel like the evolve or grow up.This is another movie that feels like it's on autopilot. It's telling the bare essentials to a story, but never flies high enough to make an impact.Where does this rank on the Disney live action remake scale? It's a step above a lot of them, thanks to the movie's visual style, which is the best thing. The circuses and it's world does feel large and you can tell a lot of the sets were built as apposed to heavy CGI as done in Beauty and the Beast and The Jungle Book. It's one of the better looking of Disney movies, but I wish the story was better suited for it.I'll give this five pink elephants out of ten. While I can't call this the worst or even a bad movie, it is something that I doubt I'll return to. Though I'd rather show the original animated movie, I think families looking for fluff and a flying elephant will like this fine. It is harmless as best. But what Dumbo needed was a real magic feather to come up with a way to soar.",Dumbo

61,bankofmarquis,In a word...bland,6,5 April 2019,"There are many words that you can use to describe films by Tim Burton: Gothic, Bizarre, Dark, Interesting, SteamPunk, Unique, Visual.With the live action DUMBO, you can add another word to describe a Tim Burton film: Bland.Based on the 1941 animated classic character of Walt Disney, DUMBO tells the tale of an animal, shamed for having a deformity...over-large ears...but when the young elephant discovers that these ears can save the circus he is in - and will help reunite him with his mother - a journey to redemption begins.Sounds like a pretty good premise for a film, right? Unfortunately, this isn't really the theme of this film. Unlike other Disney ""live action"" versions of classic animated films (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, the upcoming ALADDIN and THE LION KING), DUMBO is a live action remake only in the fact that Director Burton uses the baby elephant, separated from his mother, with over large ears who can fly. This film shows no signs of the earlier, beloved, children's film. It eliminates the songs (except as background music) and it tacks on a family drama of a returning army veteran (who's wife died while he was away) and his 2 children and a rival circus trying to steal the famed flying elephant.Is it a children's movie? Is it a Tim Burton eerie, scary, visual delight? Well...yes...and no...on both parts and that's the problem of this film. Burton straddles a line between the two, never committing to a fun, stylistic children's film (like PADDINGTON 2) or an eerie, bizarre Tim Burton film (many, many to name but the closest I can come is BIG FISH). He restrains himself to the bland middle and it shows.He has assembled a strong ensemble of actors to populate this world - Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Michael Keaton and Alan Arkin are all in this film - and are all bland. While, at times, this film felt every minute of it's 1 hour and 52 minute run time, I was longing for more from each of these characters, fleshing out what was the BEGINNING of interesting characters, but never getting past that. Each one of these characters are bland, bland, bland and you can see each actor trying harder and harder to push some sort of character to the screen, but never succeeding.The only interesting characters, ironically enough, is that of Dumbo and his mother, Mrs. Jumbo. These are 2 CGI, non-speaking characters but they say more in facial expressions and movements than all of the human characters combined.And that's the other problem with this film. Much like another Disney Live Action film, TOMORROWLAND, a large part of this film is given to showing the world that is lavishly made by the Director, Production Designer, Art Director and Cinematographer - and it is impressive indeed - but the action and characters inhabiting this world are...well...bland and that makes for a lackluster film.One thing to note - this film is not scary, nor is it overly sad (things that I heard that this film was), so I'd be interested to hear if you have younger children (ages 7-10, say) and they saw the film - did they enjoy it? I think they just might.I didn't, I thought this film was bland.Letter Grade: B- (for the interesting visuals put up on the screen)6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Dumbo
62,Anurag-Shetty,Doesn't match up to the animated classic.,7,1 April 2019,"Dumbo is a live-action take on the 1941 animated movie of the same name. Dumbo is a baby elephant with huge ears. His massive ears gives Dumbo the ability to fly. This improves the business of the circus Dumbo is a part of. When the circus starts a new project, Dumbo & his friends realize that not everything is as it seems.Dumbo is a good film. However, I liked director Tim Burton's previous movies more. This film is definitely not in the same league as Dumbo(1941). The shift in focus to human characters, makes this movie lose its endearing quality. There are one or two scenes that are extremely stupid. The visual effects are fantastic. Dumbo looks absolutely adorable & as realistic as he can look. The 3D is great. Colin Farrell is superb as Holt Farrier. Michael Keaton is under-utilized & given bad direction as V. A. Vandevere. An actor of Keaton's caliber, could have been given a much more memorable role. Danny DeVito is awesome as Max Medici. Eva Green is brilliant as Colette Marchant. Alan Arkin is hysterical as J. Griffin Remington. Nico Parker & Finley Hobbins are impressive as Milly Farrier & Joe Farrier, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Dumbo is not a must watch.

64,MihaiSorinToma,A way too childish approach,6,6 April 2019,"It's a fantastic movie which follows the adventures of Dumbo, the elephant with exaggerated ears which gives him extraordinary abilities. The plot featured is pretty straightforward and linear, with no surprises or twists up its sleeve. It's able to generate a good time in terms of entertainment but it lacks drama or suspense due to its predictable nature. Its characters are also OK, well played by their actors but again, nothing worth mentioning here either. It looks great though, with impressive angles, scenery and of course, CGI.Unfortunately, it is a movie targeted almost completely towards children. As a result, there's little suspense involved, everything is very predictable and you also get a finale like every other Disney movie. It's intended to be serious and tries to do so, but there's little to appreciate when you know what's going to happen. The dialog is also very simple, along with the action which seems composed out of ordinary activities which can be understood regardless of age. After seeing the approaches that were taken for Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast, which kept the original storyline but made it more mature and more human-like, obviously excluding the fantastic part, it's hard to appreciate Dumbo which seems childish and mediocre in many aspects. You get little besides a good idea, the elephant's cuteness and its great ability. It's a shame they haven't done more with this movie as it clearly had potential.",Dumbo

For us adults nothing can come close to the original, for teens no chance they would dream of putting down their games controller to see a kids film about a flying elephant, which is a shame but unfortunately that is the world we are living in.Dumbo (don't get me wrong) is enjoyable in its own right, great story (seemed rushed in places), great acting, amazing special effects but for me the film just didn't have that magic spark.After watching this latest CGI remake all I can think of is the recent Jungle Book and compare that to this, out of these 2 films Jungle Book (whilst different from the original animated film) still had that magic, the Disney magic but.......

I found that the characters are generally better, human characters are much more personality, which makes the film much better (since they have reduced the amount of animals in the film and have withdrawn their speech); As for the story, I found it slightly worse, mainly due to some unnecessary scary scenes (but it should be Lenbras that we are talking about a film made by Tim Burton, and doing scary scenes in children's films is what he does best), but also has scenes truly worthy of the Oscars, especially the scene in which the Dumbo takes off to fly, the opening scene of Dreamland, the scene where the circus tent falls, the initial scene with Casey Jr. Express (which nostálogy !!!!! !), the scene where Dreamland catches fire and, most of all, the soap bubble scene, which is just the best scene in the movie and that has caused me the most nostalgic ever. It also contained hilarious scenes, like the scene in which we discovered that the muscled man is the man responsible for the circus's accounting.
The production in general was good: the soundtrack was quite good and had a brutal nostalogy, the casting was quite good, and the special effects were generally good (although the elephants left a lot to be desired). I just did not like the ending, because this film defends a very sensitive theme that the other film was against, this theme is the bad treatment of the animals in circuses, which is a complete lie created by corrupt people of left parties (besides this , an animal that lived all its life in captivity, can not survivor in natural habitat).

69,bryank-04844,An elephant will never forget how bad Tim Burton's 'Dumbo' is.,1,26 March 2019,"""THIS IS THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR OR AT LEAST MOST DISAPPOINTING.""In 1941, Disney wasn't doing too well financially. It was the success of a short 64 minute animated movie about an elephant who could fly that would launch Disney back into the successful realm of cinema. Since then, this film called 'Dumbo' has brightened our days throughout the years, made us sing along to its original and amazing songs, and fall in love over and over with each viewing with the titular character 'Dumbo'. It was a simple story about a newborn elephant with large ears. All of the other animals and humans at the circus made fun of Dumbo, which caused his mother to protect him, thus forcing her to leave Dumbo and be locked up because she became ""dangerous"". Turns out, Dumbo could fly with the help of his mouse friend and became the star of the circus, eventually living a life of luxury and reuniting with his mother. It's a beautiful story for sure with a couple of thought-out, well designed characters.All of the magic that is Dumbo, the richness, story, and heart is completely lost on Tim Burton's live-action animated remake 'Dumbo'. I feel this way about each and every single Disney live-action animated film recently too. 'Dumbo' takes it a step further though and adds a ton of unnecessary characters and story plots that are so obnoxious that I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It truly as an awful movie through and through, and I hate to say that, because I love the character 'Dumbo' so much and quite enjoy Danny DeVito, Michael Keaton, Colin Farrell, and Eva Green in everything they do. Just not here, which is unfortunate.On the subject of Tim Burton, you can't help buy bask in his unique, dark style for filmmaking. If you watch a Tim Burton movie, you know immediately that it is a Tim Burton movie by the way he lights his backgrounds, his camera angles, and his gothic-like props and Danny Elfman score that is a mix between a sweet candy and haunted house for the most part. 'Dumbo' is no different from his previous style, where most of the film is in fact animated in the background (green screen style), but with human actors.Burton has done some wonderful films for sure since his debut with 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure', but a lot of his remakes of classic Disney tales or novels have been for the lack of a better word - awful. And that's what this remake of 'Dumbo' is - awful. In fact, there is a character in the film played by Alan Arkin who basically looks at the camera and says, ""This is a complete disaster."" It was as if he was in on the joke and was telling me what I already knew in the first 10 minutes of the film. It was the only time I felt an emotion during the entire movie, which was a disappointed laughter.Burton also took quite a few liberties with the story as well, and I give kudos to him for being original and not making a straight shot-for-shot remake of the animated film, but I have to take those kudos right back for failing miserably at every turn here, leaving a sour taste in my mouth for a character that I have loved since the early 1980s.In the 1941 version, the movie is through the eyes of the lovable 'Dumbo'. In Tim Burton's remake, it's told through the many eyes of new human characters, including the widowed and one-armed army vet, but now circus performer (Colin Farrell) and his two young kids (Millie and Joe), who take a liking to 'Dumbo'. The boss of the circus is Max (Danny DeVito), who runs his rough around the edges circus with his band of misfits who all take on multiple roles in his show. Meanwhile, a rich tycoon named Vandevere (Michael Keaton) and his high flying trapeze artist wife (Eva Green), hear about the flying elephant and decide to buy Max's circus and bring them to his ""Disneyland"" type theme park as the main attraction. Little does anyone know that Vandevere has other sinister plans for the elephant.Where the first movie ended in 1941, where Dumbo flew at the circus, is about the 25 minute point in this bloated 2 hour affair and it feels like 4 hours getting through it all. Dumbo now can put out fires, save humans and even have people ride him like a horse in the air. Not only that, Dumbo is a side note to his own story, where the less than thrilling and at times over-the-top characters are the sole focus. This would be okay if any of the characters were liable, but none of them really are. DeVito is holding back here, although it's always great to see him on screen.Keaton is so over-the-top and one note that you forget his character is a real person. Colin Farrell having a southern accent and not having any emotion through the entirety of the movie made me laugh and feel bad for him. Nobody is gonna believe Farrell is from the South. Then there are the two kids who are the prime focus in the film. Nico Parker who plays the young girl Millie is so bland and wooden through her role, that I thought she was just reading lines in a monotone voice instead of actually acting. The same goes for her brother in the film, but he was even more forgettable.As for the animation of Dumbo. It's okay enough, but again, Dumbo shows almost no emotion with the exception of his eyes getting bigger in certain moments. There was more emotion in that 1941 animated film of Dumbo, than there is here, which causes you to care less for this once amazing character. It was a true let-down.Danny Elfman's score pays tribute to some of the original songs, sans the most important one, which was unbelievable to miss out on a big opportunity like that, which is ""When I See an Elephant Fly"". It's not in there at all. I mean, that's the point of the movie, right? Then there was the iconic ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" sequence from the original, but in this remake is basically a slap in the face to anyone who made the original and to its audience.Again, what ever magic, mystique, or fun the original 1941 film had going for it is completely lost in this remake. I'm willing to bet this is the worst film of the year or at least most disappointing. Instead of paying money to see this movie, just watch the original instead. You'll be much happier.WRITTEN BY: BRYAN KLUGER",Dumbo
70,kjproulx,A Disappointing Remake/Reimagining,5,3 April 2019,"After the numerous adaptations of their classic animated films, it should come as no surprise that Disney will be continuing their run in doing so, seeing as they've been incredibly successful, for the most part. Dumbo is the latest big screen, live-action adaptation of one of their classics, and although it does do plenty to differentiate itself from the original film, it makes many stumbles along the way. Dumbo is great for all ages, but I do feel that many adults, and even some children, will probably find themselves bored throughout the majority of this movie.After an elephant gives birth to a unique youngling with giant ears that give him the ability to fly, certain events drive he and his mother apart, making for a heavily emotional experience. As the circus owners make new deals and bring their new elephant (who eventually becomes known as Dumbo) to a new location, not many things go their way. The original film was a solid classic, due to its simplicity, but this is a movie that takes that simplicity and gets it over with throughout the first act, which is easily the weakest aspect to the movie as a whole.The core story of the original is learning that this young elephant may have the ability to fly, but he can pretty much fly after birth here and the movie takes itself in a completely new direction, which also created a slow pace and an uneventful story. Upon completion of the first act, this movie quickly comes to a halt. There are a few endearing moments and even a few images or lines of dialogue that nearly brought me to tears, but they were very few and far between, to really create a real emotional impact. Where this film soared, however, was in its cast.From Michael Keaton to Colin Farrell (who both give very cheeky performances), Alan Arkin to Eva Green, and even the children in Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins, this is a devoted cast that is clearly having fun. Although those performers are the ones who would normally get all the praise these days, Danny DeVito is the best he has been in years. Through all of this films numerous missteps, he stole every scene he was in and kept a smile on my face throughout. If for nothing else, this movie benefits from a fantastic turn by DeVito.In the end, this is definitely one of the weakest Disney adaptations from animated to live-action, but Dumbo wasn't a film that everyone was yearning for to begin with, so that's why I think it will slowly fade into the shadows of the great ones. With a solid score by Danny Elfman and some unique flare brought by director Tim Burton, this is a film that has a lot of potential, but the script took this movie in many unnecessary directions, creating a very boring experience. I can't get myself to recommend this movie to many people. Even though it has a wide appeal for kids, I truly believe the majority of this movie would even bore them. A decent attempt, but ultimately disappointing.",Dumbo
71,AhmedSpielberg99,This is how remakes should be!,7,8 July 2019,"Although I put it on the list of my top 10 most anticipated movies of the year, I can't deny that I was very skeptical about this. From the moment I knew that the original 1941 animated classic would made into a live-action film, I was really worried how it would turn out. I mean, the beloved animated classic has a very simple story that could only work (at least as I thought) in an animation form. The original Dumbo alongside My Neighbor Totoro are the most ""innocent"" films I've seen in my life. Add to this the fact that it's directed by Tim Burton (one of my favourite filmmakers) whose adaptation of Alice in Wonderland wasn't the best thing it could be (although I liked it).To my surprise (and a lot of people's, I reckon), Burton's rendering of Dumbo marks Burton's return to his creative, unique vision he's always been known for. I can see Burton here at his brilliant. The eccentric visual panache that distinguish Burton's works are evidently present here and not only for its own sake. Burton's imaginative visuals that leap off the screen, as Dumbo's cuteness do, also add to the storytelling a great deal.What surprised me even more is when I found that this live-action remake isn't a ""remake"" per se. This is more like a movie that's inspired by the story of the original. Needless to say, the human characters here are way more richer and well-rounded than they were in the the animated film. Simply because: 1) most of them are new. 2) some of them are technically the protagonists of the story. And I can say that these characters are given a considerable amount of depth.The villain, played by Michael Keaton, is a bit over-the-top, but I think Keaton put his touch on it, and made me forget about that for the most part. Eva Green is just fine as always. Colin Farrell is just great as always. Danny DeVito is just likable as always. All the actors did a fine job, except for Nico Parker whose acting rubbed me the wrong way as well as her infuriatingly stereotypical character.Halfway through I thought the movie is pretty good, if certainly not as poignant and warm as the animated classic. At the third act, which is a bit overlong, the story became quite basic. It ends up treading very familiar territory. Even some characters have changed to fit the approach the movie took at the end, such as the villain who became even more over-the-top. For all that I couldn't help being less invested in the story, and the stretched denouement didn't help either. I also found how the things tuned out at the end a tad unsatisfying. And I believe that the moral at the end was slightly on-the-nose. That said, the messages that the movie conveys are well-woven into the fabric of the story. Mostly due to Burton's masterful visual storytelling techniques, including ingenious foreshadowing.The CGI isn't as good as I expected. I wasn't looking for something like what I saw in Favreau's The Jungle Book, but I hoped the rest of the animals would look as good as the elephants do, Dumbo in particular. Because if there is only one thing Burton did better than Favreau, it would be making the lovely baby elephant Dumbo as realistic as it's agonizingly cute. But unfortunately the CGI in general looks a bit outdated in comparison to what Hollywood has achieved in the recent years.All in all, I loved this version of Dumbo so much. And I think it's one of the best live-action remakes Disney has made so far. Also, now I can be pretty optimistic about Tim Burton's upcoming projects after I was quite disappointed from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.(7.5/10)",Dumbo
72,tm-sheehan,"Too Dark, and Lost in Translation",7,1 April 2019,"My Review- Dumbo 🐘 I rate 6:5 🐘
This is a puzzling movie to review I enjoyed it with reservations but I don't think it works as a reality adaptation of the 1941 Disney Cartoon version for a few reasons.The original is billed as an animation Drama , family musical this 2019 adaptation is billed as a Family fantasy, which it is . Of course it has to be a fantasy with Tim Burton as director but it's a very dark and I wonder if it's too dark and serious for children and too much fantasy for adultsAs for the great songs composed by Ned Washington and Frank Churchill in the original, only one Baby of Mine is sung by a Norwegian singer called Aurora's in the end titles and no credit at all is given to the original composers and yet I heard orchestrated versions in the background of the movie.I find that really annoying even if the songs are out of copyright the lyricist and composer are entitled to recognition and of the 45 people mentioned as the music department on IMBD Washington and Churchill get no mention.There's a very clever homage to the song Pink Elephants on Parade and other very clever Tim Burton touches . I'd love to spend a day in his imaginative head (or perhaps not) on a bad day it wouldn't be pleasant.The cast is very good especially Danny Devito as Max Medici the Circus owner and ringmaster and I'll keep an eye out in the future for Nico Parker who is delightful as Colin Farrel's daughter Milly Farrier.
I didn't like Micheal Keaton at all as the villain V.A. Vanderfield he seemed to be hamming it up as if on a music hall stage I wish Tom Hanks , who turned the role down to star in the upcoming Greyhound, had played that role.I suspect this new $170 million version of Dumbo may not be the Box Office bonanza Disney Studios hope for and like Nutcracker and the Four Realms , which I also enjoyed also missed its audience target and bombed at the box office.The good news is the preview of Aladdin another real life adaptation looks fabulous and they use the original songs and will no doubt give credit to Alan Menkin the composer.The secret I think is in the director as shown by Mary Poppins Returns success the director Rob Marshall who did such a fantastic job recreating the atmosphere of the original and paying homage to it while putting his own stamp on it.Guy Ritchie the director of Aladdin appears to have done the same but in my opinion Tim Burton got lost somewhere in this movie , its still worth a look though.",Dumbo
73,Carycomic,Not bad!

A former trick rider who lost his left arm to World War I...and who lost his wife to the Spanish flu while he was away.

But, the remaining twenty-five percent indisputably belongs to the title character. Especially, when he saves the day during the fire indirectly resulting from the profiteering ways of V.A.

77,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,2 April 2019,"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)1941's Dumbo was never a favorite of mine. It's a great movie with a sweet message (as most Disney flicks), but I was curious to see how a remake of a 60-min film would develop. Obviously, changes to the story not only will occur, but they need to. People have to stop desiring these live-action remakes to be a literal copy-paste of their originals and start being fair to these movies. Pure animation is different from live-action, and the latter provides a much more realistic environment than the former, so it's evident that every remake they produce will have some ""updates"" in the more ""silly"" aspects.Furthermore, I've witnessed a couple of ""critics"" hating this Dumbo. Hating! Calling it one of the worst films of the year! Now that's a strong feeling to have against a movie that improves so much regarding its original. Yes, it has a bunch of narrative issues, and the dialogues can be cringe-worthy, but hating this 2019 remake while defending the original as it was some kind of masterpiece is ridiculous. Complaining about the 2019's ending when the 1941's is absolutely inadmissible is being a hypocrite. Whining about Dumbo not being 100% the star of the show when the original has the elephant discover his flight abilities four minutes before the end is dumb. In addition to that, this film runs for twice the original's runtime! What did you expect?! That human characters wouldn't be a necessary modification?Some ""critics"" are even complaining about animal abuse or their unnecessary exploration ... Are they joking?! Have they seen the original? Do they remember how racist it was? How discrimination was treated as comedy? Even alcohol was handled as a plot point for God's sake! 2019's Dumbo barely has any animal violence, and its final message is against animal captivity or exploration, so any person who criticizes this ending is either a despicable human being or not a fan of the original Dumbo, at all.Enough about those ""critics"". I feel sick just remembering what they wrote/said. Unfortunately, 2019's Dumbo does have a lot of screenplay issues. There's no way of denying it. The human characters are filled with cliche storylines and child-written dialogues. I know that analyzing children's acting is not exactly a fair critic, but I've seen so many remarkable young actors nowadays, who make Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins performances look not that good (their scripts also don't help). The visual style characteristic of Tim Burton is definitely present, even if its magic becomes overwhelming at times. 1941's Dumbo was very concentrated in one small location contrary to its 2019 remake where V. A. Vandevere's park feels like Disneyland.The stiff dialogues don't help the movie's pacing, and its tone could be better balanced. Nevertheless, just the opportunity to watch such a gorgeous, magnificent, and visually jaw-dropping live-action elephant come to life is absolutely delightful and entertaining as hell. When a character like Dumbo makes you cry when he's crying, makes you feel sad when he's feeling sad, makes you happy when he's feeling happy, that's when you know the visual effects team has reached a point where live-action is pretty much reality. The little elephant looks like an adorable little elephant. I mean, what better compliment can I give a live-action character than ""it looks and feels real""?Even with the issues mentioned above, it's still a heartfelt story, filled with emotional moments, and a wonderful message. Technically, it might lack consistency and some overall quality, but I end up enjoying myself. Experiencing Dumbo's pain, happiness, and his bond with the kids flourish is special. Colin Farrell and Eva Green deliver good performances, and their character arcs, cliche as they may be, still carry some efficiency. There's a wrong vibe surrounding the word ""cliche"", like it's a bad thing. Not at all! Something being cliche just means we've seen that before a lot of times, it doesn't mean we've seen it performed better or worse. Dumbo is a remake of a very influential 1941 film, so obviously, cliches are a certainty. It's a Disney tale, after all.In the end, cliche as it might be, 2019's Dumbo improves on a lot of aspects of its predecessor. I do believe these movies are almost incomparable since the dimension, runtime, and even the main plot are surprisingly (or not) different. Still, not remembering or even acknowledging the original not only is an absolute flaw, but it can ultimately make you a hypocrite, so be careful with what you write/say. I understand a person not enjoying this film or not liking it as much as I did, but if you hate (!) it, you better give me good enough reasons.Dumbo is probably the most visually stunning and incredibly realistic live-action character Disney was able to produce so far. This little elephant alone is worth the price of admission. His arc is way bigger and complex than the one in the original, which can either delight or disappoint you. To me, it not only worked, but it finished strong and way better than the original. It's upsetting that the screenplay couldn't accompany Burton's impressive visual style, even if overwhelming at times, as well as the human characters who feel a bit detached from the actual story to tell. It's still a good time at the movie theater, so go see it!",Dumbo
78,mfellipecampos,Good,7,21 November 2019,"Movie of my childhood I barely took my eyes off the screen! Unfortunately Dumbo did not spend that moment of affection with his script in that failed in this part, he is a superstar in his new version, was preparing to be exciting to see a cute elephant being badly treated by ruin humans, Dumbo's CGI can get us emotional and has its Exciting moments. The human element doesn't help either, because the character's arcs are irreleful and the performances are erased, except for Danny DeVito and Eva Green. Director Tim Burton hoped he could print a load of his style, added to the rich productions that Disney movies usually have. At the end of the movie the feeling of seeing Dumbo is pleasurable, more could be expected from the Disney script and the direction of Tim Burton.

The film is charming and touching and equally has a very good story to tell. The story lives from the touching animal character Dumbo (obviously) who is perfectly animated. Sometimes they pushed it too hard with his sad eyes but still it worked.
The real life actors were tolerable. I liked Colin Farrell in the lead, the character was well crafted and nicely performed by Farrell. Danny DeVito was great and possibly the best of the cast. Nice to see him in a bigger role again and one that really fits him. Michael Keaton was the most disappointing link. Didn't like his acting here which was really below the line and kind of annyoing at times. He obviously didn't take his role or the film itself seriously or tried too hard to be a stereotype villain. Nah, not my taste of performance. Good performance by Eva Green who was very charming. Nice score by Danny Elfman. Tim Burton's approach was refreshingly un-dark.

81,MrDHWong,"An entertaining live action update of the 1941 animated classic, despite some missteps",7,28 March 2019,"Dumbo is a Disney fantasy film directed by Tim Burton based on the animated feature of the same name. Starring Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Michael Keaton, and Eva Green, it is an entertaining live action update of the 1941 animated classic, despite some missteps.In 1919, Max Medici (Danny DeVito) runs the Medici Bros. Circus, a travelling circus act that is struggling to keep an audience. In an effort to attract more people, Max decides to bring in a newborn elephant with large ears as an act for his show, with Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) acting as his carer. Much to the astonishment of everyone, the young elephant is able to use his large ears to fly around the circus tent right before their eyes. Eventually, the young elephant, now named Dumbo, attracts the attention of greedy entrepreneur V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who decides to buy out the circus act from Max and exploit Dumbo's talents for his own financial gain.Featuring solid CGI effects and some rather touching moments, Dumbo is a nice reimagining of the original film and thanks in part to Tim Burton's unique vision, it's better in some ways. Just about all of Burton's trademarks are present; the creative set pieces, the quirky characters, and a whimsical Danny Elfman score to top it off. Unfortunately, the film does noticeably drag during the second act, with many supporting characters being shoved aside and forgotten until the climax of the story. The main cast was mostly good, with Colin Farrell (likely here because Johnny Depp wasn't available) being a likeable everyman protagonist and Danny DeVito getting some good laughs in most of his scenes. However, Michael Keaton's talents feel wasted in the villainous role, playing such a typical one-dimensional cartoonish bad guy. Despite all of these shortcomings, Dumbo is still fun show for just about all ages.I rate it 7/10",Dumbo

Tim Burton was an odd choice to direct this film as well. The whole film is covered with his trademark murky aesthetic and it just doesn't fit. Danny DeVito is the only saving grace as far as actors. He is fantastic while Keaton hams it up and plays the over the top bad guy. Danny Elfman's score is decent. The film is just kind of boring though.

I loved the original and I was actually looking forward to seeing this. Out of the three new live action (except The Lion King isn't live action) Disney remakes this was the one that looked the most interesting to me. From the trailer it looked like they were going to change some of the plot so we didn't have to see the same story again. This movie was ok. I had my issues with it and it really was all with the plot. The first act of it I really liked. I thought it was like the original with a few tweaks to it. It was enjoyable. Then the second and third act came when Michael Keaton arrived. That's when it all started to fall apart for me. It just got weird, there's was so much extra stuff to take out, and it was kind of boring. I get that they wanted to do something new with the movie since the original was 1 hour long, but adding this unnecessary stuff made it almost 2 hours long. The plot mostly ruined it for me. Tim Burton directed this and I typically like him but I don't think this was the movie to direct for him. He tried to put a few ""creepy"" spots in there like the recreation of the Pink Elephant scene. There was something about that scene in this one that felt so awkward and just confusing on what was even happening. I think a different director who isn't really associated with darker movies would've benefited a little. The cast was fine though I felt most of the famous actors were just there so they could be. Collin Farrell was by far the best part of the film. I felt the most connection with him. The rest I really didn't. The two kids in the movie were fine. The daughter, Nico Parker, has more screen time but she just annoyed me. I don't know why but I didn't like her. The visual effects in the movie were mostly put on for the elephants and a few other spots but the rest wasn't anything great. Dumbo did look very cute though. Danny Elfman composed the score and it sounds like every single one of his scores ever made. It was honestly annoying me. He did put some old melodies from the original (Casey Jr.) but overall disappointed with his score. It may seem like I'm just bashing this movie but I didn't hate it.

93,Offworld_Colony,Damning with faint praise...,6,4 February 2020,"...I would have to say that when compared to Disney's other live-action adaptation, this one may be the most interesting. Despite reviews to the contrary, this film remains more Tim Burton than Aladdin did Guy Ritchie (albeit latter-day Burton), and especially when compared to Aladdin, Dumbo shows how to adapt a story with some original characters and references in most of the right places.
Dumbo isn't a particularly good movie, or a necessary one, and it certainly would have benefitted with shooting in some real locations instead of green-screens and sets. And Burton has managed to make a circus film without leaning too heavily on the cliches of movie circuses and exploitation.
It's a satisfyingly dark movie, similar to the original, with some twists and turns and a nicely evolving plot with some solid supporting cast and a bold arc in lead role Nico Parker who goes from stoic, dull-eyed and ingratiatingly smug, to warm and likeable.

96,Magow-Intermean,Dumbo Review,8,7 April 2019,"Florida, 1919. Former big top star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to Max Medici's (Danny DeVito) struggling circus having lost an arm in the First World War. Placed in charge of a newborn elephant with gigantic ears, Farrier and his children soon discover that Baby Jumbo can fly, courtesy of those oversized lugs.
At first glance, Dumbo feels like an odd choice for Tim Burton, a filmmaker more typically taken with headless horsemen, scissor-handed loners, and demon barbers. What could Hollywood's kookiest, spookiest auteur possibly have in mind for Disney's adorable flying elephant? On closer inspection, it's an inspired pairing - this is the story of a pure-hearted oddity who, like Edward Scissorhands, is simultaneously welcomed, ridiculed and exploited by so-called civilised society. Chuck in a sideshow circus setting, and Dumbo is a tale primed for Burton-vision.
The director's off-kilter sensibilities mesh surprisingly smoothly with Disney's soft, warm heart. There's sentiment and sweetness here, but also cruelty - themes from the 1941 original that Burton extrapolates and reshapes through his unique lens. Given the animation's slight 64-minute runtime, Dumbo 2.0 makes significant changes - extending the story, jettisoning Timothy Q. Mouse (and those crows, thank goodness), and surrounding Dumbo with a human cast.
When Keaton and DeVito share the screen in an unlikely Batman Returns reunion, it's a hoot.
Colin Farrell's wounded war vet Holt Farrier proves a disappointingly forgettable lead - the idea that he relates to Dumbo's otherness while coming to terms with his own recent disfigurement is an interesting but undeveloped thread. Thankfully the supporting characters are a riot. Danny DeVito is on rip-roaring Matilda form as ringleader Max Medici - part sadsack salesman, part conniving con-artist - and even better is Michael Keaton, who arrives at the point where the original Dumbo ends. When the flying elephant becomes a media sensation, Keaton's entertainment mogul V.A. Vandevere swoops in to buy out the Medici circus and incorporate them into his ironically named Dreamland theme park. Hamming it up in an exquisitely awful iced-gem toupée, Keaton is Dumbo's greatest showman - he injects a thrillingly weird energy into his scenes, even digging out his old Batman growl, clearly relishing the audacity of playing Evil Walt Disney slap-bang in the middle of a Disney movie. Whenever Keaton and DeVito share the screen, in an unlikely Batman Returns reunion, it's a hoot.And then there's Dumbo himself, near-impossibly cute with those huge, heartbreaking eyes and gigantic floppy ears. Every time he takes flight - in spine-tingling sequences delivered with thunderous momentum - and the circus audience erupts, you'll want to applaud with them. If anything, with so many additional humans around (Eva Green's trapeze artist Colette is likeable but superfluous), Dumbo could occasionally use more, well, Dumbo.
Still, with gorgeous production design - from its initial hazy purple sunsets to the second half's retro-futuristic aesthetic - Dumbo is another visual treat from Burton, with wit and emotion to boot. Enough of the original story remains, with a trippy new bubble-centric riff on the Pink Elephants sequence and a swooning Arcade Fire cover of lullaby 'Baby Mine' over the end credits, but it's when Dumbo ventures into Burton's Dreamland that it really soars.An enchanting blend of Disney twinkle and Tim Burton's dark whimsy that's at its best when venturing off the beaten path.

I thought ""Dumbo"" had terrific visual effects, it was full of heart and featured breathtaking scenes. This is a family film but don't take your younger children as they might be frightened. What other critics aren't enjoying about this reboot is that Burton overdrew the storyline and made it darker; I think he did a fine job and retold a classic Disney story in his own fashion with added flair. Movies like ""Dumbo"" make me believe in the magic of movies again. A heads up for those who will be seeing it: you will fall in love with that elephant, mark my words.",Dumbo
98,eagandersongil,No salt and no magic,6,21 May 2019,"The dumbo animation of 1941 I find a work far ahead of its time, a habitual story, that mixes a melodrama with a problem to be solved but with touches of surrealism and psychedelic, a test to the young cinema of the time that until today impresses , even almost 80 years later, this is the power of the cinema, but Tim Burton's adaptation will be forgotten between Disney's half productions and simple and formulated cinema, even with such an authorial director as Tim Burton.With a script that brings several changes in relation to the original work, but all are for the worse, neither the charisma of Colin Farrell, the quality Michael Keaton or the touch of Eva Green are enough to leverage the work.Even with a beautiful cast, the performances are weak and the actors so out of the roles they normally play, but the aesthetics of the film is very cool, gray photography and existential sadness of the circus are present and work well, besides that , the capture of Dumbo's image is beautiful, the visual aspect is the great strength of the film.A frustrated attempt and a tangle of ideas that do not work and contribute to another weak tim burton movie, without salt and without magic.

99,dianamarinelli,Underrated film,7,1 May 2021,Overall this film is really good can't beat the original but I love the message it shares. Dumbo is an ordinary elephant often teased for having big ears but his talent has no bounds and having a selfish businessman buy the circus and turn it into capitalism and love the ending when animals should be free and not captivity.,Dumbo
100,jamiedarlow-37510,A fantastic and heart-wrenching adaptation,9,5 April 2020,"The 1941 animation is absolutely iconic and it does seem to be Disney's mission to remake all of this era at the moment. With Tim's keen eye for the outsider and luscious visuals, I'd say this one does stand out from the rest of the pack for now, as great as Guy Ritchie's Aladdin was also! The cast all have a great time particularly Danny DeVito as Max Medici, the circus ringleader, who definately seems to be reprising the role of Amos Calloway in Big Fish in all its splendor! The heart and soul is naturally Dumbo himself who is gorgeously brought to life through incredible CGI that captures his emotions perfectly. As they said of the original, you really will believe an elephant can fly! Writer Ehren Kruger (The Brothers Grimm) adapts the original screenplay and adds a lot more focus on the human characters while still keeping emphasise on our hero and it works really well. The story holds a lot of darkness and pathos, brilliantly accompanied by Burton's gothic sensibilities, and the beautiful ending I believe actually improved upon the original. Also, the pink elephants scene... wow!",Dumbo
101,shawneofthedead,"Undemanding family-friendly fare, with the cutest baby elephant ever put on screen. But the movie can be a bit of a slog to get through.",6,27 March 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: Dumbo is Disney's latest (but far from its last) attempt to adapt its vast stable of animated classics into live-action films. On paper, the project seems promising - there's a hallucinogenic quality to the 1941 film that sits right in the wheelhouse of visionary director Tim Burton, who has concocted a career for himself out of wild, creepy, romantic movies about misfits and the people who love them anyway. The film also tries to do its own thing and doesn't slavishly imitate the original film (which featured next to no human characters and was just 64 minutes long.) What a shame, then, that the final product feels a lot like the other remakes Disney has produced - passable, on the whole, with a few inspired moments and ideas, while never really coming close to surpassing the charm or magic of the original films.THE STORY: Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns from the war, short of an arm and a wife, to the travelling circus that is still home to his children, Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins). He's given the job of elephant whisperer just as a new pachyderm is born: Dumbo, a baby with ridiculously out-sized ears. Holt's children bond with Dumbo, and quickly discover that his ears lend him the magical ability to fly. Soon, Dumbo's growing fame as a circus act attracts the ravenous attention of theme-park entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton).THE GOOD: Dumbo is precious - with his enormous ears and soulful puppy-dog eyes, he's easily one of the most adorable, appealing CGI creations ever put on screen. His story is also the most affecting narrative thread woven into the film, as he is forcibly separated from his mother and yearns to find his way back to her. Dumbo's heartbreak is simple, true and heartfelt, recalling the bittersweet way in which his animated counterpart sorely missed his mother. The baby elephant's tireless bravery in the face of cruel laughter and mockery will make you wish that this film named after him didn't spend so much time with other characters instead.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Dumbo, as a film, makes for a rather puzzling viewing experience. Beyond some gorgeous, gothic visual sequences (specifically Nightmare Island in Vandevere's Dreamland theme park), there's barely a hint of Burton's trademark whimsy to be found. Except when Dumbo is in the mix, Ehren Kruger's screenplay is lifeless and, on occasion, logic-free - possibly a holdover from his similarly bland work on three of the Transformers franchise's worst and most bloated films. It's especially frustrating because the bare bones of a good story are all there - especially the fact that Millie and Joe are motherless children, just like Dumbo. But it's largely squandered on paper-thin characters and a literally fiery climax that doesn't make either narrative or emotional sense.BALANCING ACT: The cast Burton has assembled is actually very good - but none of them is given quite enough to do. As a result, Farrell's charm is wasted on a character who never stops to listen while he constantly yells about his late wife being the one who could ""talk to the children"". Keaton's Vandevere winds up as little more than a one-note capitalist cautionary tale. At least there's a little snap and crackle to DeVito's harried circus owner, and Eva Green manages to suggest both darkness and light as Colette, an otherwise underwritten French trapeze artist we first meet on Vandevere's arm.FREAK SHOW: You'd imagine that Burton would take the purest delight in populating this travelling circus with freaks and oddities akin to the ones that have peopled his filmography over the years. But most of the characters in this travelling circus barely even register. If you're a fan of cult British shows though, watch out for Sharon Rooney as Miss Atlantis: she was dazzling in My Mad Fat Diary, and will steal a laugh and wring a tear or two out of you here, especially when she sings Baby Mine - one of the loveliest songs in the entire Disney canon.RECOMMENDED? Hard to say. It's undemanding family-friendly fare, for the most part, and you'll be rewarded with the cutest baby elephant ever put on screen. But the movie can be a bit of a slog to get through the rest of the time.",Dumbo

director: Tim Burton
Starring: Colin Farrel,Michael Keaton,Danny Devito,Eva Greene,Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker etcoverall rating 44/100Dumbo was unfortunately very bad and a big misfire for Disney. It was a perfect example of trying to do to much with to little content lets jump into why this is.Firstly lets start off with a positive. I enjoyed some acting performances in Dumbo. I am highlighting Colin Farrel and Eva Greene here. Colin did a good job with what he had here. Playing the father coming home from war after losing his wife was a great role for him and it was emotional to see him struggling to connect with his children who loved there mother so this was done very well. Also Eva green also did a good job here. I am now calling her Helena Bonham Carter 2.0 that is not a bad thing just an observation on how many Tim Burton films she has been in. Anyway she did a great job here of playing a magical queen who puts on great shows and it was great that she got to play a motherly figure for the children. However i would say that Finley and Nico who played the kids unfortunately there acting was quite wooden at times so therefore i did not connect to there characters as much. But i will make an exception due to them being so young. And also it annoyed me that the mouse was not included in the film as he was such a key role in the original animation.Also my favourite two acting performances in the film has to be Michael Keaton and Danny Devito. They both went all out for there flamboyant characters and i loved it. I was expecting this from two experienced actors but it was truly joyful to watch there connection on screen and it brought some much needed cheer to some parts of the film especially from Danny.However i would like to add there was very inconsistent character depth and personality in the film. Michael Keaton despite being great was a terrible villain especially with how he burnt down his own circus just because he was having a hissy fit and hit loads of buttons, and one minute some characters were nice and the next they weren't so it was very off putting and a switch off for me.Also I would like to add that there was to much forces and unneeded drama put onto Dumbo that was not needed in the film. For example when Dumbo could not fly with Eva Greene because he dropped the feather was just silly and awkward to watch and could of been cut as well. As well as a few other examples the film just dragged but we will talk about that more in future paragraphs.Next i loved the character design of Dumbo. I have to admit Dumbo was adorable to watch and melted my heart for most of my experience with the film. They really captured his big blue eyes and his design was so detailed he almost looked real. And it was great character acting from the CGI team as well it really made you root for the character even if some of the situations he was in were unneeded.However i would like to say that the whole world that Tim Burton has recreated was very unrealistic. It felt like i was staring at a green screen for a large portion of the film and you would think considering its high budget that they could change this. But i think this film needed to have a bit more realism to it considering more humans were involved so i felt like the visuals for the most part did not match with what should of been the aesthetic style of the film.Next i would like to add that i liked some of the added plot that they made for this film. In particular the focus on the children and some of the dreamworld. I knew going in that they would have to add more into the film in order to make it longer then 1 hour and i likes the concept of a father returning to war and helping his kids in the circus. And the dream world was amazing to look at and had some great parts to it my issues with it i will talk about soon.However in my opinion the plot was very over stretched and actually got boring after a while. It just felt to different to the original and they repeated themselves so many times and the new plot that they added just got less and less interesting until i was actually hoping for the film to end faster. So in my opinion the film lacked an interesting enough plot to last nearly 2 hours. And I just felt that the screenwriting for this was just lazy they just thought that they would make Dumbo fly way more then he should and hoped the audience would stay interested despite there not being a lot going on and it did not work for me. Dumbo just felt normal by the end of the film because of his over usage of flying instead of being a surreal flying elephant.However another thing they did right was they managed to capture the warmth and sadness of the original scenes from the classic. The whole pink Elephant scene and fire clown scene was done much better and had more impact and it was emotional when Dumbo got taken away from his mum so thank God that they got this right.However i would like to add that the film had to many political messages for a family film. The whole animal safety and women being scientists were not needed in the film and felt forced upon me. Despite me thinking that these are good messages to portray they were not needed for this type of film and felt to out of place.The next negative would be that i did not get a satisfying enough narrative character development between Holt and his kids. I liked the whole idea of him having trouble connecting with his children after his wife's and there mums death but they never showed any heartwarming scenes between him and his kids. They were still not close at the end of the film so i thought that they should of had more scenes with Holt forming a closer bond with his kids.Now my final two positives are that i enjoyed they added the songs from the original, this made me feel very nostalgic and this added a nice sweet touch to the film. And finally the film admittedly made me laugh on quite a few occasions. The main source of laughter came from Danny Devito. He was hilarious in this film. The fact that he was so over the top and got into so many ridiculous situations it really made you love his character.Finally ending on two big negatives. Firstly the film was just to odd. I was expecting it to be strange as its Tim Burton but this was just to much for Dumbo, With weird circus acts that want to be mermaids to a scary animals maze it was just to bizarre for this source material and i hate to say it but i think Tim Burton was a bad choice for this film. And finally the final act of this film was terrible. It was so over the top there was nothing exciting happening except Michael Keatons character having a tantrum and accidentally burning his circus down. This unfortunately hit the nail in the coffin for Dumbo.Overall despite having a few good elements Dumbo is mostly a disappointing and rare misfire for Disney who got the wrong person for the job.",Dumbo
105,Alanjackd,Pointless.,3,6 April 2019,A pointless rehash here with no discernible points at allmost of the money went on the stars and CGI. About £500 went on the script. This was a cold and miserable attempt to cash in. Burtons direction is shockingly awful...he must have been thinking about the amount of money he was getting and took his eye off the ball.Devito just about made it but Farrell and Keaton were hopeless. Shame that because so many good movies have these two in it.The 2 kids were just horrible.Only good point was Alan Arkin...who must be laughing himself silly .In the 40's and 50's kids were naive and enjoyed the story. In 2017 kids are far more sophisticated and have the internet to look at...so this will mean nothing to them.The money spent on this rubbish could have made many smaller but independent good stuff!The movie business is in a bad place at the moment and needs new ideas.,Dumbo

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight Dumbo. The live action (and CGI) version of one of Disney's much loved animations has hit our screens with all the pomp and circumstance of one of the grand old circuses. You all know the original story as told by Disney in 1942 but this new version highlights the greed and indifference that can be shown to animals by some humans, and how they can treat their fellow humans. However Karma is out to get you and without giving anything away, those people that deserve it certainly get their comeuppance. The CGI is amazing and the emotion shown in the elephants eyes is quite superb. I really did find myself believing an elephant can fly. Danny DeVito is in his element in a part like this and it is a joy to see him on the screen again. An exciting film for adults and children alike.",Dumbo

Venues, Costumes, Visual Effects, and Images show that a really good investment has been made in a successful film.Adaptation from an old cartoon as a subject, frankly I watched it for the first time, I don't know much about the subject. So I will not comment on the transfusion but sometimes I must admit that I was bored with the film, the film had a problem with excitement. They did not do the final scenes well, there were some ridiculous events, some of the events were simplified and that childish atmosphere never disappeared maybe they didn't want it to disappear.

109,movieman6-413-929510,The Dumbo live-action film works best when it is really about elephant Dumbo.,6,30 March 2019,"Dumbo is a live-action film version of the animation film of the same name from 1941. The film is directed by Tim Burton, director of Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands.In the film, the former circus star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) returns to the circus after his time in the army during the First World War. Because of his time in service, he has completely changed and he can no longer do his old circus act. Circus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) arranges a job for Holt as the elephant caretaker what he can do with his two children. When an elephant gives birth to a baby elephant with very large ears, the circus cannot make this baby elephant perform because it is not taken seriously by the public.
When Holt finds out to his children that baby elephant Dumbo can fly with his big ears, Max has hope that he knows how to make money with his circus. Thanks to Dumbo, the circus is able to attract many visitors again and can make ends meet financially. Through this positive news, entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) does business with the circus to make Dumbo a true star. He knows how to make a deal with Max, Holt and his family, but the question remains whether Vandevere is an honest businessman.With this film, Tim Burton has created an entertaining family fantasy version of the classic Dumbo animation film. If you don't take the film too seriously, you can enjoy it the most. Compared to the animation film, they have also adapted the film a bit, which means that the film does not always come across as familiar. Due to some of these changes, the film will continue for too long thanks to some unnecessary extra storylines that fill the film.
The most entertaining scenes are the scenes where the viewer gets to see the circus performance. These scenes look like you're really watching a circus performance. The film also works best when the scenes are really about Dumbo, because most of the human characters don't look that strong or special.
Fortunately, the effects of Dumbo are also well done in the film and are much better than it looks in the trailers. In this way, despite the big ears, Dumbo looks realistic as a real cute elephant, where you can also see his emotions. Apart from Dumbo and some other elephants, you can see that some of the other animals with CGI have been placed in the film.The acting work is done well by the adult cast of the film. Danny DeVito and Colin Farrell look good as circus people, who try to stay positive despite the bad times. Together with the rest of the circus staff and the animals, they form a group of outsiders, who still appear together as a real family. The film responds to the message that everyone actually has their own talents. Michael Keaton also looks good as a dark businessman, who seems to care more about money than about the rest of the circus. In some scenes the actors may seem a bit unrealistically over the top, but they do this in a way that sometimes happens to actors in a Tim Burton movie. This film is for Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins their first major film in which they act and unfortunately this can be seen in their acting in the film, because they provide some stiff acting and sometimes seem a bit too uncertain.",Dumbo

I think this one has moved up an age group from the original which was more Disney wholesome where this has a little, but not too much, of a Tim Burton twist.It's a different film from the original and I don't think should be compared. In its own right it's a good story, well acted, well paced and incredible CGI.it does come across as though it had taken a bit of influence from the greatest showman and I wasn't that keen on the ending but it was probably unavoidable, however neither detracts from a classic family movie.",Dumbo

It is directed by Tim Burton so it adds that extra flair to the original making it have a darker, Tim Burton esque aura.This version of Dumbo chose to focus more on the human characters as the movie must meet the longer length of the modern feature length movie, and I don't necessarily dislike the choice. I thought it was a very solid and heartwarming rendition of the classic tale that fleshes out a lot of the side characters, allowing them to have meaningful side plots and character development.Despite this, the main storyline of Dumbo still manages to amaze, with brilliant acting from the child actors, Danny Devito, Colin Farrell and Eva Green the movie elevates the sense of awe and childlike innocence. It also doesn't hurt that the CGI for Dumbo was amazing, making it one of the most adorable live action rendition of an animal I have seen thus far in this age of live action talking animals. I fell in love with the little elephant and was emotionally invested in his story the whole time.Dumbo is a great choice for a solid family friendly fun, not too much to delve into but great emotional storytelling that is brilliantly acted and executed.",Dumbo

Dumbo remake of a 1941 Disney classic has no heart or soul in it whatsoever.
When you spend more time on the side characters than Dumbo himself, you're making a big mistake and it doesn't help these other characters are so one-note and stereotypical that we don't end up caring about them at all. The characters from the 1941 original? Some are in there (The Crows didn't make it in I wonder why?), but only as like ""Hey remember me from the original?"" and there are little
variations of scenes like the famous ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" just so you can
be reminded why the original was better in every single way. Good job Disney!So many things crossed my mind while watching this mess of a movie. Why does the circus look so goddamn dark and lifeless? Why is Timothy the Mouse replaced with two bland kids who have some of the worst acting ever? What is the point of Colin Farrell's character having only one arm and never using it for any purpose in the story? Why is the Dumbo stuff all rushed and him and his mother gets less screentime than anyone else? Why did they mess up the tearjerking Baby Mine sequence? Why does the CGI look so unconvincing on the animals? Why does Tim Burton completely derail the second half of the movie with such bullcrap and have Michael Keaton play a terrible villain?Does this new Dumbo movie do anything good? I suppose you could argue it's at least not a shot-for-shot remake of a Disney remake like Beauty and the Beast was and there are drastic changes to the story, but at what cost? There's a few little cutesy moments with Dumbo here and there, but it's all just dragged down with such mediocrity and lack of heart and emotion. Most of this Dumbo movie
feels insincere, and the original 1941 Disney classic still gets me close to tears every time I watch it. Another problem with this remake is it's too bloody long! The 1941 original Dumbo was barely over an hour long, but this felt like an eternity! The pacing of the movie was all over the place. Disney have failed thinking this would replace the original, and there's still more of this to come!4.5/10",Dumbo

It's honestly sad to see these ""child actor's"", if you can even call them that, try and horribly fail to deliver the lines so eloquently said by the original Mouse to cheer Dumbo up and to help him, but when these actors say the original lines it just comes off as flat, boring, and almost offhandedly said as if it really meant nothing to them, if fact it's not just the child actors who speak like they've never acted before, Danny DeVito makes it seem like he's new to acting with this film giving a lackluster, boring and dead performance that almost makes you want to laugh at some points because it's so pathetic.The children are some of the worst actors I've seen in a Disney movie since the original Pete's Dragon, but at least they cared in Pete's Dragon and tried, these kids try but don't really act, and when they do they deliver monotone and boring lines that could lull you to sleep if your not careful, it's just sad to hear and see. My personal favorite part of their reel of terrible acting is when Dumbo is standing right next to them they look anywhere but where he is sitting/laying in the scene, now that's quality direction on Tim Burton's part. Colin Firth is the only actor bent on actually trying to make this movie good, but everybody else is just there for the paycheck, and apparently so is Tim Burton.When ""Baby Mine"" is sung it's not even to help Dumbo or comfort him, it's sung by random Circus folk as he walks over to his mother to recreate a beautiful scene, that again comes off as unimportant and boring, like many memorable scenes from the original film that Burton, and all the actors butcher.While they did do a good job making Dumbo expressive and cute, that's about all he was. He didn't have much of a personality at all. The film was okay, but not something I'd ever watch again. It shouldn't even been called Dumbo. It's NOTHING like the original film so it SHOULDN'T be called it.Watch this only to remind yourself of how good the original was, and realise what a disservice Tim Burton, the screenwriter, and the entire cast did to one of Disney's most iconic, and frankly one of their best films.",Dumbo
120,MickeyTheConstant,Lacks any real charm,3,18 April 2019,I found this movie a bit of a bore. The CGI was not that great and once you had seen Dumbo fly the novelty began to wear off every time he flew around the circus tent. The acting was pretty poor. Colin Farrell's performance was one of his worse and he seemed really miscast. Michael Keaton was ok. Danny DeVito was great and the standout performer. It really did lack any warmth and charm. I hate to say it but Dumbo was not actually that cute either. There was a nice positive message towards the end promoting that animals should not be used in Circus's which I do thoroughly agree with and it was sad to see Dumbo treated so badly. The anti animal/circus message and DeVito were the only real wins for this movie. I just really don't get the whole remaking animated Disney movies into live action. It just does not add anything more for the viewer and can only be for financial reasons and possibly to appease the youth of today who might see the original cartoon as somewhat dated.,Dumbo

I haven't seen it for many years now but this film made me want to watch the original Dumbo again to relieve myself the disappointment that is this film.The human stories are full of cliches. The film starts off with two young kids, 11-year-old Milly and her 10-year-old brother (I forgot his name and I don't even care) reuniting with their dad, who apologizes for not responding to their letter or something. Then, later on, we realize that the kids had lost their mom. Seriously, what is with Disney and these recent remakes about kids having deceased moms and their dads being too busy? It's like Christopher Robin (busy dad) and Mary Poppins (deceased wife) got together and had a baby. Why couldn't Disney just leave Timothy Mouse in the film as Dumbo's mentor instead of replacing him with human characters who are having cliched family conflicts in an attempt to be realistc? It shows that Disney had really ran out of ideas, remaking their already great movies into cliched borefests. It's been a long time since I seen Dumbo so I remember very little about it and can't compare it to this film that much. I also think maybe they put the dead mom trope in there just so that they can make Milly better relate to Dumbo. If I'm correct, Timothy didn't have some problem dealing with his mom and he still was supportive and compassionate of Dumbo.The acting was robotic. The only emotions the kids showed were grinning but they just looked bored throughout. Which I don't blame them for because this film is so boring. Watch the original with your kids instead. This is just a borefest for both kids and adults.I'm sorry for saying his name 5 times already but why they couldn't bring back Timothy Mouse is beyond me. Maybe they didn't want to put creepy CGI on a mouse but bringing him back would've made the film at least 2 times better.The only good things I can say about this film are that Dumbo is cute and there were some memorable scenes that were faithful to the source material like Dumbo's touching relationship with his mom like for example the Baby Mine scene and then there's the pink elephant scene.",Dumbo
122,scb_coldsteel,"Worst live action Disney film, but man that elephant was cute.",5,7 April 2019,"So I watched Dumbo at the theater. I can't say I was too excited for this adaptation. Dumbo was never one of my favorites and besides Big Eyes Tim Burton has let me down over the years. Overall the movie was just as mediocre as expected. It was easily the worst of the live action Disney films.We all know the plot of Dumbo fairly well. A baby elephant with big ears is separated from his mother and learns to fly in the circus. Of course this version updated the content a bit with a substantially darker tone and a satirical look on multibillion-dollar corporations. Odd choice concerning Disney is a multibillion-dollar corporation, but I degress. I will say the movie thankfully omitted the racist caricatures the original film had.The biggest positive for this movie was Dumbo. The character was amazingly cute. Like every time you looked at Dumbo you just had to smile level cute. The film really made a baby elephant flying come to life in an awe-inspiring manner. Plus there were some genuinely cute and funny moments between Dumbo and his surrogate family. When the movie tried to entertain the whole family it really did a good job. Surprisingly the movie doesn't utilize enough Dumbo though as he feels more like a secondary character compared to his human family.Of course the animation was also outstanding. Dumbo had a hyper realistic look that just brought the character to life. The CGI elephant seamlessly interacted with his real-world counterparts in a way that really helped the immersion of the movie. The movie was certainly worth seeing just for Dumbo's special effects alone. Seeing Dumbo fly in the air was truly the highlight of the film.So I liked the special effects and just how cute they made Dumbo. Unfortunately everything else was a mess. The film had a very strange and inconsistent tone that really felt out of place. The movie was surprisingly very dark at moments. There were a few scenes that could easily have made a small child cry. But the film still incorporated cotton candy kid content and a very poor script so I'm not sure who this movie was made for. It was also such an odd choice focusing on the human family and their struggles over Dumbo. I get the original movie was pretty short, but the added content only weighted the film down.Speaking of the script, Dumbo really dropped the ball. The pacing of the film was not very good at all with an overly long introduction, a muddled second act, and a rushed conclusion. The script managed to take everything special out of a Disney film and turn the movie into a bore at times. The overly simplistic, yet dark script just never really managed to catch my attention. It was also a bit ironic that the film's main antagonist was a greedy and heartless individual who wanted to monetize childhood wonder at the expense of Dumbo. The film was almost self parody on Disney at this point.It certainly didn't help the entertainment that all the characters were so dull. When a movie stars Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, and Colin Farrell that simply should not be a sentence in a review. The characters were walking one dimensional caricatures that added nothing to the movie. The over acting in the movie didn't come across as fun, but was simply a distraction. All of the actors seemed to be trying to sleepwalk through their lines in the most unrealistic way. Considering the poor script that makes sense though.Tim Burton of course added his classic directing aesthetic to Dumbo which as a whole didn't work. The movie was dark and for the most part ugly besides the well done CGI. I appreciate a director having a distinct look, but at this point Tim Burton seems to be regurgitating the same tired ideas that made a film like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory so bad. Also Danny Elfman does not need to score everything. His score just didn't work for this movie and honestly was quite distracting.Dumbo was my least favorite live-action Disney film. I was never a fan of the original, but this movie just didn't work. The CGI was great and Dumbo was cute, but taken as a whole I was bored through most of the movie. With an inconsistent tone, poor writing, and non-existent characters I really didn't enjoy the film. Tim Burton needs to stop making big Hollywood movies. A 4.75 out of 10.",Dumbo
123,blrnani,It was always going to be a challenge...,6,16 November 2019,"...to make the beloved animation into a live action movie.
Amazingly, they have managed it, and turned it into a much fuller and more interesting story in the process.
The biggest challenge, of course, was going to be convincing the audience that a 'realistic-looking elephant' could actually fly, but for me they crossed that hurdle most charmingly.
I accept the criticism that the adult actors were hamming it a bit, but that tends to be the case when live action strays so close to pantomime and given this was aimed presumably at children around the age of the two child protagonists - both of whom seem to have a future in the business, I might ad - it's a risky business to make the 'evil' too realistic.
Another factor to be born in mind is that Dumbo starts out as a newborn baby and is still a 'child' at the end of the film, so I think one must take that into consideration when it comes to expectations - indeed Dumbo's character grows to a surprising degree over the course of the film.
Definitely a recommendation for children and one that parents will enjoy too, I think.",Dumbo

125,RhapsodyReviews,Sloppy Remake,5,3 November 2019,"Review:
'Dumbo' is a fantasy-adventure film directed by Tim Burton. It is a live-action reimagining of Walt Disney's 1941 animated film of the same name.
A young elephant, whose oversized ears enable him to fly, helps save a struggling circus, but when the circus plans a new venture, Dumbo and his friends discover dark secrets beneath its shiny veneer.
I just got finished watching this movie with my family. It is one you would want to go see with your family; the kids will love it. There are some things to enjoy with this adaptation of the Disney classic, but for me a lot of it just fell flat and I think that falls mostly on the director Tim Burton. I can not fathom why Burton directed the actors, mainly, Michael Keaton in the worst performances of his life.
I really don't think Michael Keaton knew what movie he was signing up for, or he didn't care about the film at all. He is one of my favorite actors working, and I don't know where he was in this movie. Colin Farrell was okay at best, his character had a bit of backstory, but not much else came out. The child actors were god damn horrible! I feel bad saying that because god knows that they did a better job then what I could, but I'm also not getting paid, and somebody had to give them the job! There were only two performances that stood out to me in this movie and that was Eva Green who plays a trapeze artist who is flying with Dumbo, and Danny DeVito who plays the small circus owner. These two were the stars of the show and they seemed to really care about the story.
The elephant is cute and there are some scenes which are quite emotional, but after the initial flight, there's little amazement to see. Visually it looks very good but overall, I found it a cold and dark experience, especially when it shifted from the family run circus to the corporation style theme park with its stereotypical villains.
I know I said there is stuff the family can enjoy, and there were parts I thought to be very entertaining. The way they did the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" scene was a smart take on what the classic offered us, and once Calin Farrell's character get introduced as the new elephant caretaker, the whole scene with the small circus was pretty good. Unfortunately, it was when Michael Keaton entered, and they moved to the bigger circus is when this movie went downhill for me.
Danny DeVito should have directed this movie, because I think if he could have done to this what he brought to Matilda, the movie would have been completely different and more entertaining.
Overall, this movie didn't really have any heart, it was darker than what I think it should have been, and most of the actors just didn't seem to be in it. I know I may be in the minority with this one, but all I can do is spread the truth, even though it's my own.

Even though I didn't understand what they were saying, I still enjoyed the film. Dumbo was cute and I thought they showed him enough, loved Danny Devito and of course Michael Keaton. I didn't get Eva Green's character. Was she a bad guy or not? I also loved how Danny Elfmans score returned to form in a Tim Burton movie.I would like to say that in America, in every theater I go to we got commercials, then more commercials, and then we get a coming soon card and that green screen about it being a preview, then we got all the closing stuff before getting to the movie. So about twenty minutes of our time is dedicated before the movie even starts. The Spanish theater I went to said screw all that and ignored coming attractions, that green screen and showed us two previews: Aladdin and Toy Story 4 (with the song in English and the voice acting in Spanish) After that it just went to the movie.

129,snowfre,Less charming than the original but Burton's unique design and the acting saves the film,7,15 December 2019,"Due to my experience with Disney's many new reimaginings of old animated classics, ""Dumbo"" could well have become another uninspiring, money elephant - I guess - for the conglomerate. And while the film has several flaws, it still comes across as much more of an original work than any other of the House of Mouse's live-action/CGI reboots. With a slightly revamped storyline, involving a tycoon (feels like an evil version of Disney himself) played by Keaton and a little human love story between Farrell and Green, and minus the nowadays controversial crows, ""Dumbo"" is much different from the original. While some viewers might reject that, I feel it at least gives this movie some reason to exist. The ""Lion King"" reboot I found by all means unnecessary, mainly because it followed the original to 99%. There is simply no point in making an updated version of an old undying classic if you don't change it up a bit. And Tim Burton does that in ""Dumbo"", also throwing in some of his brilliantly, vibrant design, especially at Vandevere's theme park towards the end. Is it enough to make an unforgettable piece of movie magic? No. But the visual experience is satisfying, and especially DeVito and Keaton acts flawlessly. How about the title character himself? He's among the cutest thing I've ever seen.",Dumbo

There is a couple of the remakes I look forward to seeing like Mulan and Aladdin, but this one I don't think I really needed it. The effects were outstanding. The only thing was they overused them and if you overuse them they don't always look good. For example towards the beginning of the movie a boy ran through some steam and it looked terrible. Also some times when dumbo would fly. The acting was fine. The little girl felt like she forced the lines to come. There were some sad scenes that actually felt bad for the people in.

140,samyoung-82648,No heart,5,14 June 2019,"How can you be so close and yet so far? This film is stunningly beautiful with some big name actors. It also has some reasonable story and a variety of characters.
Where is fails is clear. It plays too cute with Dumbo, it has two unlikeable performances from the leading child actors in a kid's movie, and there is far too much politicking for a kids movie.
The cutesy of dumbo wears thin after the 20th focus on Dumbo's shimmering eyes. You eventually become fatigued by the same schtick.
The two children can be summarised as follows. The girl is highly obnoxious, a first class know it all who bleats on about science about 1/2 dozen times. The boy has no personality, has nothing of value to say, and he is almost always several steps behind his sister in most scenes. This ""girl is science and boy must stand well behind the girl"" is a common theme in modern Disney ... hello Disney!! Pushing your sex politics on children, and so heavy handed about it! Was this how old Disney was, playing sex based games (answer: no, it's a modern trend).
Even if you can look past the heavy handed sex politics of Disney (which any decent parent should not), is there any heart in any of the characters? Colin Farrell is a solid actor who doesn't deliver in his role as the father, Danny Devito lacks oomph like he used to, Michael Keaton goes from credible to one dimensional villain at the click of your fingers... the only consistent performance is Eva Green as the lead circus performer: half grace, half exotic, mostly charming. She's nowhere near enough to carry the dead weight (especially the dull/arrogant children who fail miserably).
Despite so many major failings (and I mean catastrophic), I gave the movie half marks because everything else was stellar. However, I strongly discourage my children from seeing this film (and I did) because of the disgraceful sex politics that Disney embraces in recent years. Despite seeing this prejudice frequently in the last few years, it shocks me when I see it because it's targeting (bullying) the children who want to believe in Disney's magic..: alas, that magic died. We are unlikely to see the old style of magic in lion king or Aladdin ever again. Disney's ethics and warmth of character standard has dropped significantly in their activism against (and in favour of) different groups of children.

Where are the storks delivering babies? Where's the funny black crows? What the heck happened to the memorable song ""When I see an Elephant Fly""? Where are the elephant ladies? Even the Disney movie ""Operation Dumbo Drop"" had that memorable song.The only character I liked in the film was the Circus Ringleader Danny Devito who was the only likable character. Why don't the human kids or their dad with a disability get enough screen time? Where's the emotion? Why isn't Dumbo shown enough? This story is very long boring and confusing and it's almost 2 hours long. Seriously Disney company! You could've told a great story in that allotted time. I only see the circus show for the most part even when the greedy owner causes a fire to spread in the circus park. There are creepy elements that Tim Burton brought into this film. I didn't like how dark this film is. I don't really like animal cruelty in this film but the 2D cartoon was much lighthearted and better to watch.Why didn't Disney company make it fun like the 1983 Live action Disney Channel TV show Dumbo Circus? They could've made it a fun enjoyable film with more emotion. Given that they have all this CGI technology. Why didn't they just make it a CGI 3D animated film it would've worked better?I'm very disappointed in this film Disney company you could've had a great remake if you make it more like Dumbo Circus 1983 TV show? It's too bad this movie flopped, they could've make it better so more people would've seen it. I would suggest skipping this film and watch the classic 1940 Disney cartoon Dumbo or watch Dumbo Circus 1983 TV show.

So im pleasantly surprised the dumbo rise my expectation even though there were some flaws with the film story.The character of dumbo and the children of this film is where this film really shines, giving a more emotional and somewhat darker tone that pulls on the heartstrings. Dumbo at its core, tell how a story of being different can cause you to be an outcast, while also delivering the strength to overcome those who might treat you poorly or look to profit at your expense. the film delivers this sweet and simple message in a brief 64 minutes of the movie.Not only this, god knows how not sure if anyone else picks up on the message, how Tim Burton got away with this message embedded in the film context I do not know but it was the biggest F you to disney when I noticed it I kind of laughed and through wow you actually went there.But the film as a whole is great, not perfect, but still capture the heart of the story of dumbo pretty well, despite having a few flaws, but it worth checking out.Dislikes: I felt dumbo character wasn't on screen enough, it felt like what happened with Godzilla there wasn't enough screen with dumbo which the film should have been more focused on since the film is about him, apart from that this was a great film.",Dumbo

A couple of years ago THE JUNGLE BOOK got the same treatment and was considered a runaway success. Tim Burton has very competently done the same thing here, remaking and expanding upon the original and it has been met with mixed reactions and I feel that's a little unfair in many ways.The character of Timothy mouse has been excised from the story and Burton has replaced him with a human element in the shape of two young children and their wounded war veteran father (Colin Farrell) . In some ways this might remove some of the magic the original had but it replaces it with a more relatable storyline. The first half of the film sticks relatively closely to the original film but the second half things tend to get a little bit messy where the films starts to resemble Burtons Batman films in places, but fortunately it all comes together towards the end.Dumbo himself is beautifully brought to life, as are the rest of the circus animals. Farrell and the children are also perfectly fine in the film but the real human star of the film is Danny DeVito, effortlessly stealing every scene he is in and having a whale of a time like he did in Burton's BATMAN BEGINS 28 years earlier. Michael Keaton is always good value too and hams it up as a bad guy (in a terrible wig) but poor Eva Green is not given that much to do, although what she does do she does well.Over the last 30 years Tim Burton has turned out some memorable, and not so memorable films but they always seem to have his own distinct visual touches to them and Dumbo is no exception. To me, and a lot of Tim Burton fans, his masterpiece will always be the wonderful ED WOOD from 1994. Whilst this film was never likely to hit those heights it still sits comfortably within his body of works. So in essence, a good film, Yes! a great film? probably not but still fun to watch.",Dumbo
149,cockezville,A Yawn Fest,5,2 April 2019,"Tim Burton movies can be magical, or they can be tedious. Dumbo is the later. The acting is stilted and the characters all feel flat. Danny DeVito tries hard, the kids have no personalities, Michael Keaton overkills and even the fake Dumbo feels misguided. And what kind of accent did Colin Farrell attempt to deliver. It just didn't work.
But the kids will love it.",Dumbo

Dumbo is the most beautiful Disney remake ever.

152,Benslie,A good kids movie but a slow burn for everybody else,7,9 April 2019,"First of all, baby Dumbo is the cutest thing ever and whenever he was on screen I only paid attention to him. The special effects team had to make a cute baby elephant with big ears and they did just that. Now the acting in this film could've been better by certain people and others did their parts really well. One of those people was Colin Farrell, who played Holt Farrier. He stood out to me mainly because I really enjoyed his character and what he was going through and out of all of them I think he's definitely the most relatable one. For the rest of the cast though I could tell they were trying but probably should've been recasted for example, Michael Keaton as V. A. Vandevere. I've seen Michael Keaton be a great actor in other works but this just didn't suit him. The character seemed like it was created for Johnny Depp but Tim Burton couldn't get him so he had to go with the second option. Also, I hate hating on kid actors because they're kids but the daughter in this film was just bland. But then again this is her first movie ever so I'll give her a break. I do love the set designs in this film though. I also love the message in this film and I think there's actually two now that I think about it. Two things I would change if I could would be the pacing in the film and the ending. The pacing in this film felt slow until the end where it picked up way too quickly that it felt rushed. Which leads into how the ending was awkward and I didn't feel like it was a good conclusion. In the end, Dumbo is a good kids film or for people who like Disney movies. For everybody else though it's a slow burn at best.",Dumbo
153,ajzeg,"Look, I'm going to be honest with you guys, I didn't even really pay attention to this one.",2,1 December 2019,"It was just kind of on in the background and I glanced at it from time to time. From what I could gather, this movie is better than Aladdin and The Lion King. That's not saying much though. It is still way too long, it's filled with bad writing and acting, all the colour is washed-out and it doesn't seem to understand what made people like the original so much. Some of the designs were kinda interesting, the CGI was decent, some parts were so bad they were actually pretty funny and Danny DeVito is unironically a national treasure, but that's about all the good I have to say about this movie. It is more original than some of the other Disney remakes, it's kind of like Evil Dead 2 because it's part remake but mostly a sequel, but the original plot they came up with was just stupid and it's been done better in a million other movies. After that Alice in Wonderland remake/sequel thing, can we all agree to keep Tim Burton away from classic Disney movies? His macabre but whimsical style just doesn't work for them. Can we just get another stop-motion movie from him already? Thanks. Anyway, this movie is not as bad as some others I've seen, but it is not good. I'd say just skip it and watch the original Dumbo or Big Fish instead.",Dumbo
154,KathleenK22,Loved it!,8,21 June 2019,I love elephants and I loved the first Dumbo movie many years ago so I was not too hard to please on this one. Also loved how modern values informed the ending. The children were lovely and Dad was too; it was easy to relate to the characters. It is not supposed to be an adult movie but for children and the young at heart with a heart. Concepts needed to be kid friendly and nothing too scary or emotional to prevent children from being the main audience. A hint of romance thrown in as well and nice values for the kiddies.,Dumbo
155,amarshoaib,Disappointed,5,11 August 2020,"It was slow, boring and very predictable but visually beautiful. They ruined a classic, and made it more about the people than the animals. Didn't give me the same magic as when I saw the original as a child",Dumbo
156,yellowmarlin,Sadly charmless,4,8 November 2020,"The decision to make Dumbo mute (unlike the animal characters in the live action version of The Jungle Book and The Lion King) takes all of the magic out of this story.

However, in this movie his touch doesn't really exist: if you don't know that he is the director, anyone else could have signed the movie.
For this reason I was a bit disappointed. However, the movie is well done and the fable of Dumbo is always able to make me cry. Some scenes are touching and others funny.

One of my favorite things is how they didn't just remake Dumbo with live people. This is a very original story. A comparison I've been using is how Scrooged IS A Christmas Carol. And yet it's it's own film as well. Same thing here. You know the story but you don't know every step.
And Elfman created one of his most original scores in years. Maybe decades.
My child loved it, every kid in the theatre was reacting to the moments and seemed to love it.
I highly recommend this very fine film.",Dumbo

It's sort of messy, I think I can understand what Tim was trying to aim for but he didn't really succeed, this is one of the Disney remakes I can nearly say I enjoyed but can't entirely because of how messy and all over the place the story is. As far as visuals go this thing is beautiful, we all want to feel bad for dumbo, Michael Keaton's role is kind of annoying and he plays a dick of a character, but not a good one. Scene in which Colin Farrell's character comes back from the war with a lost arm is what I feel more of a sad moment in the film. Overall average film lacking a good story. Grade: C",Dumbo
162,willians_franco,Interesting production by Tim Burton,7,6 August 2019,"Good entertainment from Wall Disney, although not as good as the original cartoon version of 1941. The costumes are beautiful, the scenery is beautiful, the computer graphics are reasonable and the actors do not leave much to be desired. Eva Green is as beautiful as ever.
This version of Tim Burton tried to create a captivating atmosphere for the viewer, looking for an emotional side, as the relationship between the baby elephant (Dumbo) and his mother. I believe he was not as successful in this purpose as the 1941 version. Maybe it's a trend in the movie market: to create more and more films based on cartoons or superheroes from the past. It is a valid bet, but risky, because comparisons will always be made between the various versions, running the risk of possible disappointments.
One detail that caught my attention was the subliminal message of the film. It follows the ""politically correct"" agenda imposed by Wall Disney, according to which animals must live out of captivity and free. And circus with tamed animals is no longer compatible today. This seemed to me to be Disney's ecological message.
Anyway, I repeat: it is good entertainment. I think it's worth watching.",Dumbo
163,v-ley,Overrated baloney,3,8 July 2019,"Any other person would have done a much better job at this beautiful story. Tim Burton ruined this movie! I hated every moment. Every scene had his classic wrought-iron fencing detail in the frames. He demolished a story that was great into so many sub-plots that were not.

164,helenbassett,Disney Dumbo Film Review - Tim Burton Directs A Dreamland Where you Can Believe An Elephant Can Fly,8,28 April 2019,"I saw Disney's latest live-action movie Dumbo last week, directed by Tim Burton, and reimagining the story of the original, and only, flying elephant. One of Disney's most endearing characters, and Baby Mine one of their most heartbreaking moments. The animated version had captivated viewers since 1941and now Tim Burton brings a whole new adventure. Even including the Disney train that starts all their movies.And Dumbo gets a whole new family with Colin Farrell's Holt Farrier returning home after WWI. Minus an arm and a wife who died while he was away serving. But his two children are waiting for him in the Medici Bros circus, with Danny deVito's ringmaster Max struggling to keep his troupe solvent. And his office monkey proof! But Max has bad news for Holt, he had to sell his horse act as they needed the money, but hey they no longer had his wife to perform with them anyway! But good news Holt as we need an elephant handler. Well Holt I can tell you is thrilled!Mrs Jumbo is not an old fat elephant, but just about to give birth to the Medici Bros newest act. Or he would have been if he was cute, but he's a freak, just look at those ears cry the circus performers. Of course to us viewers baby Jumbo is the sweetest CGI thing, with ears that trip him up, and those imploring baby eyes. When he makes his circus debut in the original clown make-up, his ears are wrapped in a baby hat. But when they accidentally pop out he is ridiculed by the audience, Jumbo becomes Dumbo with a slip of the title on his pram, and the name sticks. And Mrs Jumbo is shackled away as a Mad Elephant after trying to save him. This is the big Baby Mine moment from the original when the circus baby animals cuddled close to their mothers, and Dumbo and his Mum wrap trunks. And it is cute, but with no tears or baby animals this time, and poor Dumbo unknowingly sharing this tender moment just before Mrs Jumbo is sold.Holt's children Milly and Joe, played by Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins, try to comfort him, they of course miss their own mother, and amazingly when they play, Dumbo sucks a feather up his nose, and flies when he sneezes it out. Of course Milly and Joe are surprised, because who ever saw an elephant fly? And we see our first Disney magic dust in the sepia filled gloom.But really who would believe it, until the audience sees Dumbo fly around the bigtop, and he's a sensation, and it really does feel like we are watching magic.nI know it isn't real but I want to believe an elephant can fly. News travels fast and Michael Keaton's villainous V. A. Vandevere and his mol Eva Green arrive, and buy up Medici Bros. Eva transforms into the trapeze artiste Colette Marchant. With fabulous costumes by Colleen Atwood and make-up by Lisa Eldridge, even Dumbo is attracted to her. Or maybe it's the feathers.But it's not all Wonderland in their Dreamland, although Vandevere is quick to merchandise Dumbo. Also available at Disney stores now. Timothy the mouse never makes it out of his cage and there's no alcohol for him or Dumbo in 2019, although we do have pink elephant balloons from the gorgeous dancing girls, with Dumbo transfixed. But there are dangers ahead with the whole Medici Bros circus troupe facing the chop now that Vandevere has Dumbo. Dreamland itself needs investment by Alan Arkin's banker and Vandervere's heavy, played by exotic and villainous Joseph Gatt, fancies a new pair of elephant skin boots. Hiss, boo.This is much more going on than the magic of an elephant who can fly, but baby Dumbo will make any movie fly. Although I wasn't so sure about the new Medici Family Circus and how thrilling it would be without a star act. And the ending was perfect for 2019, although I preferred the original one.",Dumbo

167,Clank_Zoka,Well That Could of Been alot Worse..,6,30 March 2019,"I'm not surprised to see that Dumbo is getting the remake treatment, but what makes me curious is that Tim Burton... ""The"" Tim Burton is behind it, I love the original Dumbo, it's beautifully animated, emotional and so memorable, a childhood favourite, but now that the remake of this iconic animated film is out and I saw it today and...... it was surprisingly decent, not great but decent, so let's talk about it.The story is about a circus from Max Medici (Danny DeVito), who are trying to put on a show for audiences are around the world, until Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) comes back from the war, he has two kids and now has to look after the elephants instead of horses, one called Dumbo who has the ability to fly when sneezes from a feather, until V. A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton) takes Dumbo's mother away to his other Circus, so Holt, his kids and a group of freaks have to try and save Dumbo's Mum and..... yeah you can guess the rest, it's pretty much what you expect from here, it's super predicable and surprisingly quick, so in a way it's because I was enjoying myself and the movie never bored me, but I did notice it's far too similar to the Greatest Showman, but in a bette then that overrated piece of mediocrity.... think about it, however the movie was like I did enjoyable, but not much else to that, there is surprisingly not a lot of comedy here, not that's it not funny, it does have it funny moments, even if it's not much, but it takes it mostly seriously which helped the film become watchable and slightly interesting, so at least it's something, even with a story that has a tad bit of good humour, enjoyment and decent drama, it's still a generic and easily predicable plot that doesn't do anything close to the original movie, it has some elements from the original movie but not by much.The visuals are easily the best thing about this movie, it's colourful, visually stunning, the effects and CGI are decent, Dumbo looks incredibly cute and I just want to pet him, and with the circus scenes it makes it so wonderful to watch, so this is easily the best looking Disney Live-Action film to date... HOWEVER, it's also one that doesn't quite blend CGI and live-action well, okay sometimes it can work, but sometimes it doesn't feel like they are in a real world, which is pretty weird and as much as Dumbo is adorable, he can get somewhat creepy when close up and some of the other CGI animals look quite standard, but with Tim Burton, most of his films are stunning and this is one of them, so with all the flaws in the visuals, it's still a stunning and somewhat impressive looking film, complete with a cute looking elephant.The characters are just forgettable, I didn't care about them at all, the only human character that I enjoyed is Max Medici, he's quite likeable, funny and enjoyable, everyone else is just bland and not very interesting, Holt is just the hero and the father of two children, he doesn't deliver a lot to the movie and is just there all the time, the two children are just bad, they are exactly like every other kid character in every other kids film, Colette is quite charming and is also great, but she's not in the film for long so not much to say, Dumbo is still a strong character as he was in the original movie, he's enjoyable, fun, loveable, charming and you root for him to get his Mum back, his Mum is not in the film for long but she is the driving force for Dumb and it's why he's going to this circus, she's also got charm and personality and the emotional side with her and Dumbo is really effective, the acting is good for the most part, Colin Farrell does a pretty good job with Holt and his American accent maybe stereotypical, but it's still great coming from a Irish actor, Danny DeVito is a lot of fun in the movie, I will never get tired of him, like his character, he's likeable, fun and hilarious, Michael Keaton is over the top and is having fun with his role, but nothing special or better coming from him, he's just... fine, Eva Green is beautiful, delightful and charming, everyone else is fine and does their job exactly like that, but the kids..... the kids!.... now I'm sure they'll be in better future projects, but in here, they are so bland, not a lot of energy or like-ability, they are the worst actors in the film and I know they are trying but it's not enough, with bland and forgettable characters, dull acting, a few stand out characters and some pretty good acting, the characters really don't offer a lot in quality.Ermm.... yeeeeaaah, this movie was.. decent, not bad but... not good either, Dumbo is spilt in the middle of all the Disney Live-Action movies, it's quite predicable, the effects don't quite blend in with the live-action scenes, the characters are boring and some acting is even more boring, but thanks to the enjoyable moments, it's heart, wonderful visuals, some stand out characters and pretty good acting, the film was watchable and pleasant to sit though, without them, this movie would be even worse, I mean it's not as amazing as the original movie but it's decent at least, so it's time to jump back into animation next time, with a certain stop-motion movie and a animated Nickelodeon Movie...... hmmmmm.I'll give Dumbo (2019) a 6.9/10.",Dumbo

No, Dumbo is not the central character necessarily - there are several complex characters developed throughout the movie. It has Tim Burton's humor and style all over it. So give it a chance!

175,Abranth-d,Don't mess with the original,6,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Dumbo. So Dumbo is the live action adaptation of the 2d classic of the same name. It's directed by none other than Tim Burton and stars Collin farrel and an adorable cgi elephant. The plot is like something of a pop up kids book and is very close to the original movie. But Tim Burton's touch of weirdness gives it the tone it needs. Now the cgi elephant in this movie is the only reason you need to watch this movie cause that guy is adorable ! The best part is how you know he's made of cgi and yet you root for the little fella. The bad guy in this movie is Michael Keaton and his characters lines looked forced and not too intimidating like cruella de ville or jafar even though that's how it should've been. The movie also has Danny devito and it's funny how the lead of Batman returns are in a movie directed by the same guy . The humour in this movie is mostly one liners and falls flat often . Michael Keatons character tries to break the pg13 rating at times and censors it himself like a nod to Disney execs. It's not that revealing unless you notice his lines carefully. In the end , Dumbo was a magical ride which misses the spot by God knows what . It's like the thor movie or avengers age of Ultron , it's not bad but just not that great. But with all being said , the cgi elephant was like brother bear meets Bambi level adorable an I think that's the only reason you need to check this movie out .",Dumbo
176,alexqueens,Lackluster for lifetime cinephiles,5,30 October 2019,"Dumbo is well cast with fine actors doing a fine job at memorizing their lines and feigning the necessary emotions, whilst boasting solid production design and effects to make anyone proud.
But - and this is only due to me watching movies for almost 40 years - it's a story I've seen too many times before, in similar variations. So it's good for little peeps that haven't seen many of these types of stories playing out before them throughout the years.
I mean sure, you could say the same thing about revenge flicks. If you've watched at least 5 in your lifetime, then you've seen them all. New revenge films rarely bring anything new to the party. Maybe they surprise you with a twist or two, but the fact is, they all come down to the same old formula. Our protagonist will end up eliminating all bad guys for what they did or were involved in. Usually in strangely entertaining fashion. Which is why we all love a good revenge flick.
But a fairytale such as Dumbo, a little less so.Honestly, I'm surprised Tim Burton even bothered to get on board with this without yawning the whole way through the script. How is a guy with his talent and impressive filmography not inspired to awe audiences with something new and unique? Surely something to ask him at the next dinner party. But he'll probably just say that he has a soft spot for anything resembling a twisty gloomy fairytale. And Michael Keaton.",Dumbo

Sadly, this film did not live up to my expectations. I would say that the reason why I think this film really fails to leave a mark on me is its story: the movie does not take the same route the original did, instead focusing more on human characters rather than Dumbo, and that is really disappointing taking into account he was the best part of the film. The human characters are uninteresting, and the acting overall is ok and does not stand out that much. Also, despite having great CGI in the animals, the overuse of green screen and saturation over most of the film make the locations seem unreal and at times dull.

The only nice thing I can say is the movie looks good visually, and the younger actors do their best. That's honestly it. This just might be Burton's worst film which isn't saying a lot, but his Alice in Wonderland film was much more focused even if it was cliched. Dumbo however feels VERY unfocused. Did they want this to be about pro animal rights?Parentage? Disabilities? Shady corporations? What is it?? Nothing lands, nobody has chemistry, even Burton's alums like Keaton and Devito don't match well here. This whole film just falls flat. The story beats feel manipulated like it's just going through the motions, and that hurts me to say that. It's beyond appalling that Burton and his screenwriter figured out how to take this nice movie about this cute baby elephant, and just suck all the life right out of it.

Given the original movie's runtime at 77 mins long it really made sense for the movie to become 104 mins.Within the 104 mins for this remake, they used every second to make a wonderful and heartfelt story and really gave it purpose. The acting was pretty average for a Disney Remake. The extended plot was entertaining and very genius.But, what really gave Dumbo my undivided attention was the Visuals and sounds that helped make dumbo create a ""Steampunk"" feel with it. This theme adjoining with the other elements really make this movie a wonderful movie for the eyes and for the mind..Why is this film so underwhelmed?...

Before people start attacking me and start a debate going, I want to say that it's a lovely story on its own, and even if it didn't exactly follow the past structure of the original Disney, cartoon Dumbo, it was still amazing on its own. The elephant was wonderfully portrayed, and the costumes were beautiful, in my perspective. Yes, I'm more of a soft-hearted one, but when it comes to movies, I'm usually very critical. But this one has to be great. My mother enjoyed this Disney movie, and usually, she falls asleep watching them with me. The visual effects were amazing too, and it might not be worth the taste of people anymore, because people's standards are higher, and they might not like this kind of fantasy, happy-ending story anymore.

I went to see what I thought would be a lively remake of an ancient Disney film, but instead saw a dark, cold movie with unpleasantly fantastic sets, a hint of cruelty, and some disability. I would not have gone to see this movie had I known before hand that it was by Tim Burton. His fans may love it, but I'd seen Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands and sworn off his movies.",Dumbo

195,JoeYabuki,"Not good, not bad",6,31 March 2019,"It's not a bad movie buuuttt it could have been much much better, I am disappointed. At first it is slow and boring, and I almost fell asleep; at 35 minutes it takes off and it gets a little bit interesting. Although it's the Disney movie that has the Tim Burton fingerprint of the 80's everywhere. OST reminds us a LOT of Edward Scissorhands. I can not say either that it's a good movie, is not up to the old one. It has the essence of the original but a lot of things are changed (I already said it, the Burton label). The villain (Michael Keaton) is horrendous, great actor wasted. Batman and the Penguin together again after almost 30 years, Burton made it possible. The elephants are VERY WELL MADE IN CGI. And ""Jumbo"" is REALLY cute.",Dumbo
196,craigthomas90,Doesn't feel nostalgic...,6,3 April 2019,"It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but, it's not awesome either. The movie attempts to tug @ the heart strings quite a bit and is somewhat successful however, the film is over saturated with these attempts. The joyful awe that I felt watching the animated version as child is non-existent here. Connecting with the cast is damn near impossible. Dare I say they are all unlikable. One thing I missed most was the talking animals. This is a huge subtraction from one of the best aspects of what the original offered. The cgi is spotty in spots but overall solid. It's a solid film that would've been better as a straight to Netflix movie. Let's hope ""The Lion King,"" and my personal favorite ""Aladdin"" are more exciting.",Dumbo

199,DJKwa,An affable remake whose sense of awe and wonder is in short supply of genuine emotion.,6,26 March 2019,"Much like the hyper-realistic CGI rendering of an elephant at its centre, Tim Burton's modern update of Dumbo is a visually impressive feast diminished by an unmistakeably manufactured feeling.While the decision to remove talking animals could have been taken as a sign for a more human take on the classic story, the script by Transformer's scribe Ehren Kruger quickly reveals itself to be uninterested in developing any of its human characters. Told largely from the perspective of the two young kids (played by Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins), there is little depth provided to any of the adult characters, especially Michael Keaton's Vandemere who is little more than a sleazy business man than a genuine loathsome villain. Moreover, the film's rushed conclusion offers little by way of payoff to any of the human characters and only Dumbo's narrative is concluded in a satisfying manner.Still, Burton is nothing if not a distinct visual stylist and his penchant for lavish set designs and a striking colour palette meld well with the whimsical story. Overall, the film's striking visuals ensure that it goes down easy, but Burton's Dumbo is an affable remake whose sense of awe and wonder is in short supply of genuine emotion.",Dumbo

201,searchersd,Dumbo Politicized,5,22 September 2019,"Yes, animals should not be subjected to maltreatment, in circuses or anywhere else for that matter. But in this current version, the original story of Dumbo gets lost beneath the anti-circus politicizing. Back when the original movie was made, we loved going to the circus, loved the elephants there, and so loved the original Dumbo story. This was the circus. We had no idea what went on after the bigtop closed. With this new Dumbo, we are presented, very clearly, with what actually went on after the performances. And it killed our enjoyment of the movie. Circuses bad, all elephants should be taken back to their homes in the jungle. No mention, however, that they're no longer safe there either. Definitely not your original Dumbo movie. And not to be recommended to my grandchildren either.",Dumbo

When will they ever learn that kids nowadays will never, ever, not in a billion years, see a visual effect and go ""wooow!"" It just won't happen, they've seen everything.A CGI elephant that can fly is not interesting. It's not amazing, it's not even cute. It's very well made, I admit that, but it's also as ordinary as they come. To make a film watchable, you need characters, stories that surround the main attraction. I mean interesting, fleshed-out characters. Not the smartass girl and the ""but dad, you must believe me!"" boy, which we've all seen in thousands of movies since Lassie.This isn't even a children's movie, they are smarter than this. The best thing about it was Danny DeVito, whom I consider a rather important name for cinema. He's smart, he has a grasp of his art, at least.

205,LBarlane24,"Beauty and the Beast gets a pass, but this doesn't?",8,30 May 2019,"Dumbo stars Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Eva Green, Alan Arkin, and Danny DeVito. It was directed by ""you know who"" and was written by Ehren Kruger who is apparently infamous for his work on the Transformers films.I'm gonna continue by saying that I went into the film with expectations as low as you can possibly imagine. And after having seen it, I will be honest and say that I enjoyed it. While far from great, I still found myself enjoying it for the most part.PROS:
1. The direction - Tim burton has gotten a ton of backlash, which is nothing new. I've seen few critics go out of their way by trashing films of his such as Batman Returns and, of course, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now, Alice in Wonderland, on the other hand, I understand, to be honest, as it was the least faithful to its source material. But come on, this, and the other two I mention, are perfectly fine, by direction stand-point. I mean, the way it was shot, the costume designs, and even the set designs looked spot on.2. The cgi- Unlike some people, I thought that the cgi was on point. Dumbo, the titular character, looked pretty genuine from my view-point, that is except when he flew. Not only that, watching him (spoiler) react to his mom being taken away was, honestly, pretty hard to watch.3. And last, but not least, Danny DeVito. What can I say other than he basically stole the show; no pun intended. I don't know how, I really can't put my finger on it, he just stood out for me.CONS:
1. The acting - Yes, I will admit that the acting, while not bad per say, it was not very good, especially from the two child actors. In addition, Eva Green carries an accent throughout the majority of the film. Specifically, it's a French one. And I don't know, is it even her natural accent? Because it sounded pretty unconvincing to me; which is pretty ironic, considering that the actress is, in fact, French.2. The writing - This is, quite obviously, the main issue that critics and the mass majority had with the film. Yes, the pacing isn't (very) well-handled and the first two acts are quite subpar. But on top of that, the third act is where things finally start to pick up. And last, but certainly not least, I will agree that most (if not, all) of the ""characters"", with the exception of the titular one, were not all that interesting. I mean, the only one that I found to be the most interesting was the one-armed dad. But other than that, the other few did not have as many layers as they could have.So yeah, those are pretty much my only gripes with the film. With all that said, Dumbo is not a shot-for-shot remake, like Beauty and the Beast, it is, instead a (like it or not) re-imagining of the 1941 animated film. So don't go in expecting a mouse named Timothy (except maybe a brief cameo) and do not, do not expect any of the crows to appear. Not that I didn't like them in the original. But come on, do to the reputation they've gotten over the years, and the era we're living in now, I doubt that it would've been possible to have them in this.All in all, this film isn't technically Oscar worthy, but it is still a good film, despite its flaws, and I give it an A-.",Dumbo

So I have some advice for the film makers STOP REMAKING CLASSICS!! Also why is Colin Ferrell still getting work?
I think if Hollywood really felt the need to remake these films they'd be better served by just cleaning up everything in the original films and at the most re-record the character voices with current actors to help sell it to the new generation or just leave them alone and stop ruining a good thing..!!",Dumbo
218,elizabeth-12994,Good,7,17 April 2019,"The film was good but I wouldn't go as far to say it was brilliant. Parts of it were brilliant but not all. Definitely for all the family and if you have seen the original, Dumbo is a sweet story, as you may already know.The storyline is simple enough to follow but complex enough to enjoy. In terms of storylines, it was perfect as it was balanced out. Dumbo wants to get his mum back. To do that, he has to do well in the circus so they can buy the mother back.Special effects were superb. Dumbo looked very real, along with when people were to touch Dumbo, and it did look like they were touching him, which can be a common mistake in films like these but this one avoided it.The acting from most was good. There were some parts where you could easily pick up on where they should have been more or less dramatic. The casting could have been better from some but not all, like Michael Keaton who was great.The music was good, not something you'd point out but it was still really good. In my opinion, the first things you would point out are the special effects and storyline, and rightly so as they really deserved lots of attention when in the making of the film, and that's what they gave it.Costume designs were good, again, not something you would point out in my opinion, but still good.What I did think was good was the amount of thought they put into Michael Keaton's character's place later on in the movie. It was very Disney and magical. I thought that was great.This movie is, pretty much, for most audiences. There isn't a particular age group that wouldn't go and see this movie.

I was pleasantly surprised, however, by this film's incredible acting from the lead adults and the heart the story possessed. It's a film I would show to any child, but I believe it can be enjoyed just as much by adults. I saw Dumbo with my step mother and she cried continuously throughout the movie, so clearly, Dumbo also has the ability to touch people's hearts as well as entertain. The visuals are incredible, the film looks gorgeous and the CGI on Dumbo was amazing, I could bye that he was really there. In conclusion, Dumbo is a film that is heartwarming and touching, with phenomenal acting and decent writing. If I had one problem with the film, it would be that the child actors are rather wooden and sometimes emotionless, but hey, they're kids. This film deserves an 8/10 and I highly recommend it.",Dumbo
220,gjw,Why Tim Burton?,4,28 March 2019,"I have to wonder why anyone would choose Tim Burton to direct an adaptation of what was a very sweet, innocent children's film? Tim Burton has a talent for one thing: creating movies that are weird, macabre, and creepy. That talent works well in dark movies that are inherently weird, macabre and creepy, such as ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". But whenever he strays into mainline films (such as ""Batman Forever""), he can't resist inserting the macabre and creepy into what should be normal films. It's his nature. That works fine if he working on something like ""The Corpse Bride"", but who on earth would dream of having him helm a movie like ""Dumbo""? It's like hiring Alfred Hitchcock or George Romero to direct ""The Wizard Of Oz"". Their talents lie elsewhere. I can't blame Burton for taking the money when he's offered it by the biggest studio in Hollywood. But it was a bad call by Disney, which should have known better.",Dumbo

Unfortunately I was wrong and still can't believe it either. Tim Burton has his own unique style of making a film, but only one feature in this movie screamed his name, which was the overall use of color. Many of the characters felt undeveloped (the children), the CGI wasn't as good as advertised, and the overall film had a flat story compared to the original animated film. That might sound confusing, knowing that it's a remake, but a good portion of the movie was changed and it honestly didn't really work. I understand that this film is for small children to enjoy, but so was the original, which applied emotion in the right places. I usually try not to compare films to each other, unless it was a remake or reboot, in which this case it is.

231,rubya,Disappointing,5,29 July 2019,"Being a fan of the original Disney Dumbo as well as Tim Burton films I was looking forward to seeing this Dumbo. Add in Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton and it should have been a treat.Unfortunately it was difficult to get into the film.
If you haven't seen the original then maybe it's not as bad but I have and the first issue is that they changed the story quite a bit. The animals don't speak anymore, humans take more of a central role, maybe even more so than Dumbo who becomes an accessory. And Timothy the Mouse is not part of the story anymore other than a 3 second meaningless cameo.
This could almost be forgiven if the characters were endearing and interesting but they are not (apart maybe for Danny DeVito who plays the part very well as you'd expect). They're a strange mix of wooden caricatures. The daughter (Nico Parker) in particular comes across as annoying, pretentious and not likable.Being a Tim Burton movie, the sets, colours and costumes are stunning. The CGI however wasn't so. I understand it's needed to make Dumbo but it was distracting. While trying to make the CGI Dumbo look more like the original film character (over-sized ears and big blue eyes), they made him look weird rather than cute. In a live action film you'd expect him to look more realistic (as much as a big eared flying elephant can be).All in all it's not a terrible movie but it's forgettable, a bit boring and if compared to the original cartoon, it is disappointing.",Dumbo
232,mldardar,You'll wish the little girl could fly--far away from the movie set!,3,30 June 2019,"When I saw Dumbo had been made into a live action with CGI version, I was so looking forward to it. I was expecting it to be a top quality lovingly made movie like Christopher Robin (2018). Not a remake, but true to the characters. Unfortunately for fans of classic Disney, it doesn't seem like any love went into making Dumbo.Lots of people have said only Danny DeVito did a decent to great acting. But I think most of the stars did their parts well, even Michael Keaton, because Disney's villains are usually over-the-top phonies. Irishman Colin Farrell did pretty good as a Southerner. Eva Green, as gorgeous as actresses of early cinema pulls out her French accent. Many are being nice, kind of, by not singling out the little girl, saying ""the kids"" did poor acting, but the boy acted natural. The little girl ruined the movie for me. Bad enough the strong smarter-than-anyone else in the movie young girl has now become a stereotypical character, white & non-white versions, but her mostly gloomy expression, if you can call it that, sets the mood of the movie. I know she smiled in some scenes, but all I see when I picture the movie is that emotionless face. Oh how different & refreshing this movie would've been if it had been made when Saoirse Ronin, Anya Taylor-Joy, Taissa Farmiga or Hailee Steinfield were young! Or Dakota Fanning!
We're also treated to a brief scene of the world of the future at a science museum, where we see a man in a dress doing housework, & a woman in a man's suit on a phone presumably conducting business. Yeah, can't leave anyone out these days.
As for accuracy, this takes place in 1919 after WWI (not WWII as someone commented). As I said, Colin Farrell speaks in a Southern accent, & when the story begins the circus is leaving Florida & we meet the characters after it stops in Missouri. It isn't clear where he & his wife were married, but it would not have been in the aggressively segregated South. The original had none of these characters nor other story lines, but someone at Disney or Tim Burton felt the need to add them in an attempt to politically correct history. And beloved characters like Timothy Q. Mouse, & others were sacrificed. These days it's fine to change a white character to non-white (too many to name), & to get approved to play in China, change a villain from Chinese to a white woman (Dr. Strange), but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES can you have a black animal, like a crow, voiced as a black person.",Dumbo

234,ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM,A DUMB DUMBO,5,22 April 2019,"One of the joys of grandparenting is that you get to see all the kid flicks which, today, are some of the best movies being made - or remade.Disney released the animated Dumbo in 1941. It was a short 64 minutes long and Disney made it far less lavish than its 1940 release, Fantasia. In spite of the turbulent times (released just 6 weeks before Pearl Harbor) Dumbo went on to be Disney's most profitable film of the 1940s.The plot is pretty simple with the kick being that Dumbo, a baby elephant with huge ears, is separated from his mother, Jumbo, and comes to befriend a very smart mouse. Eventually, Dumbo is able to fly and, of course, becomes a sensation and is reunited with his mother. The original Dumbo is a delightful movie that has just enough magic in it to re-awaken the child in all of us. Essentially, it is about friendship, self-confidence and the joy of being who you are.And that brings us to the new Dumbo, directed by Tim Burton, written by Ehren Kruger with an all-star cast including Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin. Somehow, the new Dumbo tries to bring in all the elements of the original Dumbo but in a live action movie instead of an animated one. At first you might think that is impossible, but the magic of CGI should never be underestimated. Dumbo stumbles and falls and screams and flys!
It is a beautiful movie, as many Tim Burton films are - but there the comparisons with the original end.This Dumbo is much darker - did we mention that Tim Burton directed it? Having Colin Farrell as the lead puts a shadow over the whole enterprise (even when he laughs he seems sinister) and then add the fact that hIS character lost his right arm in the war and this Dumbo is markedly different looking than the watercolored Disney original.And there are new plot twists, like an evil Keaton who cons a gullible DeVito (I think that is a first for a DeVito character) into a partnership so Keaton can get his hands on the flying elephant for his big, brash amusement park on Coney Island. Did you ever think you would see a Disney movie that decries big, brash amusement parks?Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito are excellent as usual while Alan Arkin is totally wasted in a throw-away roll as a soulless banker. Eva Green (Casino Royale, Penny Dreadful) plays 'the woman' in the movie so while she starts out on the side of darkness, she must change in order to provide some romance for Farrell who has two kids who lost their mother .... really, this is supposed to be a kids flick starring a one-armed malcontent somewhat violent widower.And for all of that, it's not as bad as the critics have made it out to be. Hey, it's tough to totally screw up a movie about a flying
elephant.",Dumbo
235,NotoriousMayhem,Promising start but a mess overall,4,5 May 2019,The start was promising but that it ends there. The movie tell over the place and was such an utter bore. They took the classic dumbo and stepped all over it. A huge disappointment,Dumbo
236,implaxis,Just... bad.,4,2 August 2020,"15 minutes into this thing and I'm wondering, who directed this? It's really bad. The kid actors were horrible. And so were Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton. I'm sure the boy was chosen solely because he looked like the mouse in the original film. After the initial flight I'm ffing through it, something I rarely do for movies. Watched bits here and there, cue the credits. Tim Burton. Oh, that makes sense... it was quirky. But not in the least bit magical, or entertaining.",Dumbo
237,justicewillprevail,Wish they spent on dialogue versus effects,6,8 April 2019,"Awkward chemistry between the leads, made worse by overambitious plotting and underwhelming dialogue. Let's be clear, production quality is high except for Farrell's left arm. The sets and CGI are good, which is where the movie gets its passable rating.What makes classics better than these remakes is their pacing and focus on target audience. Keep it simple: is it old vs new, science vs nature, parent and child bonding, animal cruelty, romance or circus film? Trying to be everything to everyone makes this 2hr film feel like 3 hrs and yet leave with hollow ending.E.g. the one dimensional antagonists that do bad stuff, just because...

239,pruz-55801,Umm....I don't know.....,6,4 April 2019,Walking out of the theater I am so confused. Because at the end of the day I didn't feel like I wasted my time and to be honest it was a good movie but then again there was hardly any heart but it had a satisfying ending. One thing for sure is tim Burton definitely left his mark on this film as it was the darkest modern Disney I saw! (Strong caution to parents bringing young children) The first half of the movie was the almost pure retelling of the classic dumbo story we all know and honestly you feel for dumbo. You feel for him when he gets made fun of. You feel for him when he finally flies if there's one thing for sure in this movie you definitely felt a connection to dumbo. But after that it goes all downhill I don't want to spoil it but let's just say it's not what you expected the only thing that was keeping me from going out of the theater mid film was that same connection to dumbo. You wanted him to succeed. Not the side characters not that the villainin should fall but for dumbo. But the reason I give this film a 6 is because its not THAT bad there were cute moments and Collin Farrell and Danny davito were great (unfortunately I can't say the same of the child actors and Michael keaton) And the cinmatography was amazing! So at the end of day should you spend your precious time on this film. I can't really say sorry. I still have mixed reviews myself. But one thing I can say is that the pros outwihh the cons.Pruz Reviews,Dumbo

260,jessbir-23618,honestly not that bad,7,21 July 2019,After reading all the terrible reviews for Dumbo my expectations where very low going into the theatre and I came out genuinely surprised. the movie has very many flaws one of them being Nico Parker who plays Millie even though she is very charming her acting is pretty bad especially compared to the rest of the cast who all did a very good job. another flaw for me is the lack of colour almost every single scene has this dark murky texture to it that isn't very appealing. but I did very much enjoy this remake and I honestly don't think its that bad. for the most part the acting is very good especially from Eva Green who for me was the true stand out of the entire movie I found her acting the most believable and impressive. Dumbo is absolutely adorable and steals every single scene he is in and the flying parts of the movie are absolutely gorgeous and magical. the baby mine scene though not as emotional as it was in the animated movie is done beautifully here and it still made me tear up a little bit. the pink elephants on parade scene was absolutely brilliant and in my opinion was one of the better scenes in the entire movie. overall despite all the flaws I really enjoyed Dumbo and would watch it again.,Dumbo
261,OperaTarte,The Elephant Left the Room,5,17 April 2019,"Dumbo is used simply to bring a paying audience anticipating 'magic' into a theatre.

Danny Devito is - Danny Devito. Alan Arkin's short appearance was inconsequential - he seemed to being fed his lines a la earbuds. The kids were annoying and unnecessary the least of all the actors.

268,lf_macias,I felt like a child full of wonder,9,3 April 2019,"One of the most iconic scenes in Tim Burton's filmography is the moment in which Wynona Ryder dances under a shower of snowflakes that were caused by the ice that Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp) causes with the sculptures he makes with his "" hands"". Much of the emotional impact of this scene is the great and emotional score of Danny Elfman, which among choruses and score accompanies a circular movement of the camera. Every time I see this scene it is impossible for me not to let go at least one tear.
In the version he has made of Dumbo, Burton emulates a sequence that presented the same emotional impact for me: the first time the small, big-eared elephant takes flight in front of the amazed eyes of two small children.
And that's how that made me feel this new live action adaptation of a Disney animated classic: as a child. From the initial sequence where an animated map is transposed to the trips made by Danny DeVito's errant circus, to witness the sad separation of the little Dumbo from his mother and finally close his story in a satisfactory way. This movie kept me captivated from beginning to end.
If something has Tim Burton, is that he knows how to build sequences that culminate with an exciting event. Dumbo is not the exception, every moment has an emotional climax that allows one to be involved in the story. It is a story that does not present major surprise in its development, but that is very well assembled on a technical, artistic and emotional level. It is noted that this time Burton made a story close to his heart, because it is heart that the film has most.
The big star of the show is, of course, the little elephant, a wonder created by what the CGI effects can achieve now. His look, his movements, everything feels very natural. The same happens with his mother, Mrs. Jumbo and the rest of the particular animals that make up this circus.
The actors fulfill their role, although Colin Farrell and the children are a bit static to my liking. However, when the rest of the movie is so good, that's the least of it.
In the end, Dumbo 2019 is a fable that promotes above all the right of animals to live in their natural habitat outside of captivity and the dangers that large conglomerates bring to those small businesses that are beginning to succeed (ironic in Disney after the purchase of Fox).
Dumbo is a film that from beginning to end put a smile on my face and made me feel excited, moved and totally involved. And that's what you look for when you go to the movies. Thank you Mr. Burton for giving me that moment.",Dumbo

It's interesting how polarizing people are... I thought Dumbo the elephant was adorable and the concept had some potential. Can't say I was blown away, I thought the story was simple, obvious and lacked complexity and emotional range. I thought the characters each displayed one-faceted personalities (excluding DeVito). I mean the young girl establishes herself vocally rather than through action as a scientist. Then in the most elitist fashion possible, declares herself unwilling to participate in show business because she likes science. Science and circus acts are not mutually exclusive... Let's be clear circuses have a long and sorrowful history of animal abuse, mistreatment and neglect. This movie could have been like a good war movie: showing complex characters fighting against the establishment for the sake of a unique baby elephant separated from it's mother. I know Disney is capable of producing mature films that are still magical and appropriate for younger audiences just look at the Jungle Book live-action or Coco to see how good this movie could have been!

For me to say that I like a remake or live action better than the original, is very rare and a very big deal. It was an incredible story! I really hated the Pink Elephants On Parade song as a child. It scared me and I had nightmares. I loved the way they did it in this movie, and Dumbo's expression while it happened was just too precious! Amazing movie, great for the whole family(or in my case date night).

275,ZombieGirlORV,"You know this story, and it isn't Dumbo",2,4 April 2019,"They really managed to overcomplicate a sweet and simple storyline, causing the original message to get lost in an entirely different story, the same story which Hollywood has been shoving down our throats repeatedly the last ten or so years. It's getting old. This 'new' message of 'large corporations bad/underdogs good', followed the cliché that all successful businessmen are greedy, heartless, power-hungry monsters who'll do anything to get what they want. An overplayed roll at the best of times. Surprisingly the main character was no longer Dumbo, but a little girl, who fit the cookie cutter Hollywood standard: Little girl who overcomes the patriarchy, (represented in this instance by her father), to live her dream of being a scientist. Again, the same story we've had shoved down our throats in countless other movies has now taken over one of Disney's most classic stories of self-discovery. It was entirely disappointing. You see, at the theaters we have a unique opportunity to escape politics and everyday life to live in a world of fantasy for whatever brief period we've been allotted to go there. Disney believed that if you're only catering to children then you've already failed at entertaining. I'd like to add upon that by saying that if you only aim to tell the same story repeatedly, injecting it in to previous stories that were perfect good without it, then you've failed at story telling. Somewhere along the line Hollywood only managed to remember a single story in the vast empire of stories it's accumulated throughout the years, and that story is what was represented here. Not Dumbo, the story which Disney brought to life and inspired millions with over generations. But the same story you've seen in a hundred movies over the past few years. Why bother going to watch it at all? You already know the story, and it isn't Dumbo...
Okay that was harsh. Positive sides of this monstrosity now...The acting was good, despite the butchered storyline. The actors did an amazing job...AND special effects were pretty cool as well, so good on the special effect's artists, that could not have been easy...As that's 2 positive traits I was able to find, I think it's fair I give the movie at least 2 stars.",Dumbo

We see evil deals with emotionless Dreamland owner (Keaton) that wants to make a profit from children's dreams maybe Burton hates Disney's corporate crap shoot of studio executives today or maybe Disney himself. No stalk intro or drunk Dumbo just focus on the circus which is a tad boring. Dumbo looks great he's doing his job he's cute but all those terribly written characters and bad performances left me cold. I don't know how they messed up Dumbo but they did. However the ending made me think that Tim Burton made the film to mock Disney as Dreamland burns down I swear he was trolling the Corporation and probably the audience as this is another remake soulless cash grab and they mostly all make money I don't think this one did though but the parallels between Dreamland and Disneyland are there and him showing it being burned down by its owner says it all. I definitely got The Last Jedi vibe about this movie were Rian Johnson trolled Star Wars fans I believe Burton did with Disney and it's fans. I do hope this isn't the future for movies as we also have woke filmmakers using emotional blackmail to sell movies and calling audiences names if they dont see the film or criticize it (Charlie's Angels 2019, Ocean's 8, Ghostbusters, Men in black international even critics were called racist for not liking Black Panther) wokeness is not monetizable Comic industries try it and fail, people are put off being talked down to or mocked. Cinemas are losing money more either way people would rather stay at home to. I watched the original Dumbo before this and it's much better.

288,ayrton_seno,Visual power of Tim Burton's mental circus,7,30 March 2019,"Dumbo begins where Batman ends in terms of Burton's signature neogoth visual setting, giving this children' classic a more serious setting and making it realistically tangible for the 21st century standards.In the end it really is all about embracing the uniqueness of a ""large-eared-sad-clown-face-painted-elephant"" within us and learning that we don't need those metaphorical feathers to fly.Make no mistske, this is a ""Disney-for-adults"" movie and who better to portray the magic of a Freak's warm heart than Tim Burton?",Dumbo
289,TheCinemaMan,Burton NOT,1,9 August 2019,"Looked forward to this version of Dumbo but sorely disappointed. I guess the more sophisticated can pick out Burton style but I think virtually any other director could have done as well...maybe better. As others have noted, DeVito steals the show pretty much making the rest of the cast look ""cardboardy"". The kids, especially the girl character, were not in the Disney tradition. Add to this obvious predictability and dullsville begins to loom large. But Disney doesn't care. It didn't make it's money back domestically but did very well thanks to non US viewers and that bottom line will keep Disney going screwing over the classics.",Dumbo
290,johncomo-3,ITS REALLY NOT DISAPPOINTING,9,16 June 2019,This is a children's movie. Any adults just trashing the film for no apparent reason is missing the point and oughta be a shame. Kids want to see the elephant fly and that all that matters. All of you haters were kids once before put it in perspective. Stop comparing the animation version with this one please. Stop trying not to let today's kids see this movie. Had there not been an animated version you would think it was the best thing since the circle.,Dumbo

292,Fenrir_Sleeps,A warning from Burton and a possible premonition,6,4 May 2019,"It's curious how an ever-growing company like Disney keeps calling someone like Tim Burton to take the helm of their movies.Beyond the political correct, anachronistic moral of the ""circuses should have no animals"", Burton's ""Dumbo"" is quite pro small, family-sized business, against the evil that lurks beneath the shiny veneer of big capitalist corporations.The spectacular fall of Vandevere's Dreamland serves as a harrowing sign that Burton seems to be giving to Disney...if the Mouse ever falls under the weight of its own recent larger-than-life greed, how much value Burton's ""Dumbo"" will gain, as a warning, a premonition from within?",Dumbo

296,Sir Gerry,Not that bad but...,7,24 November 2019,"I must be in the minority since I actually enjoyed the movie, not as boring or cold as most people say, but what really tires me is Disney's agenda, the little girl behaves like Anita Sarkeesan, ""I wanna be known for science and my mind"" and then in the future land exhibit, the guy in a dress and the wife in a suit. Gee Disney, cut it out already, focus on your stories and leave the agenda behind, I wouldn't think Tim Burton would lend himself to the ideology.",Dumbo
297,LinaInverse23,Falls short of being a decent film!,5,5 April 2019,"I, like many others, grew up with the old cartoon, so needless to say, I am a fan! The first thirty minutes of this film were truly good, although it mainly followed the story of the original. Once Michael Keaton shows up, the film starts to fall apart (no fault of Keaton's acting abilities). The villain is extremely one-dimensional, and all emotional connections to the children, and even Farrell's characters, fall to the wayside. Farrell was completely wasted here, and his character poorly written; there was little to no development with any of the characters. The two children were good actors, however, there lacked emotional depth to the exposition. Once the third act comes around, there is little investment to continue on as everything becomes lazy and predictable. One of the positives is Burton's terrific visuals as he certainly knows how to bedazzle. Aside from this, the film falls victim to the same plagues as Alice in Wonderland.",Dumbo

I also cared about the characters and Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton were great hamming it up. Hence can't understand what more people would want from a live action Dumbo movie. Personally, I love the Disney live action movies and have bought them all on both 3D and 4K. Haven't watched the cartoons in a long time, since the live actions came out.",Dumbo

Very entertaining, gives you the ""feels"" in a good way!

The writing is brilliant, Tim Burton creating a darkest sweet version of the classic movie, the costume design is awesome, the production design crazy good like every Burton movie and the cast - AMAZING. Colin Farrell with a sweet performance, Eva Green stunning like always, Michael Keaton showing us his dark side and Danny DeVito stilling every single scene.

There was a lot of expectation from this and from the trailer, it looked like the hype was warranted and i am pleased to say, it was right. This is a highly entertaining but also sad in parts, movie, that has plenty of magic, jeopardy and some of the most beautiful animation i've seen for some time.
As for the live cast, they may not win any Oscars, but are believable enough and the kids cuteness fits in well against the rugged rest of the cast.
There is some scarier elements to this, which could put of younger viewers, but there's also some scenes that make kids laugh their socks off, so it's still very much a family film.",Dumbo

318,stuffkikker,"total rewrite of the original, and such a shame it is... and really: why?",3,8 July 2019,"The original movie was about an elephant and a mouse, and rather cute in many ways. The story was well-written, paced in excellent fashion, having great drama without the need for real villains. Even by today's standards it works well!This movie was a total rewrite at the hands of one of the writers for the Bay Transformers series and Directed by someone with a flair for dark fairy-tales (but rather bad at cute and endearing) leaving very little of the original intact. The mouse is no more and the elephant became an extension to a story about a family of single father and young children and the circus owner. Broken families and villains, the latter being rather telling: if a story works without villains, why put them in? Because clearly the story no longer works...The result is basically much like one of those transformer movies: flat characters developed through cliche's with a lot of bombastic CGI and dramatic music to give us the superficial sensation of something engaging, even though this movie fails to actually engage.
This is ego at work. Writers and directors and such thinking they can improve upon a successful piece, do better, or, like a friend of mine calls such creative territorial behavior: 'have a pee on it'. Now, unfortunately, this movie definitely got a stink to it.",Dumbo

The kid actors were the absolute worst, they were SO ANNOYING. All the actors were miscast, you felt disconnected and there was no magic at all.

The little girl's performance was so wooden and unemotional, a cardboard cutout would've brought more life to proceedings.The focus of the entire film felt wrong, seeming to be more about the cliched evil of big corporate takeovers (how many times have we seen this?) than a loveable elephant who eventually realises he can fly.One or two very fleeting moments of magic in an otherwise tedious.",Dumbo

With this they have completely destroyed the story and have presented us with emptiness and an attempt to be magical just seems desperate. There is an element of enjoyment at a basic level but as a Disney film, it's sad to see the outcome. The characters completely lack any kind of connection to the audience and it all feels very mechanical. Dumbo himself is cute and appealing, and his story does appeal to the emptions however what could potentially be an incredibly moving story focused around this elephant, ends up being more about everyone else.

All i can say is i thought it was AMAZING!! Literally could not have asked for better. Mr Burton managed to capture the old world, goth side of the circus without making it to weird. The story packs some new grit and untold before chapters but still remains true to the original and is lots of little gems and easter eggs for the original fans to spot. Flawless acting, fantastic CGI and actually quite emotional (personally i think Dumbo is anyway). My one thing i would say is im not sure its for the younger audience.. if i was a kid id probably find this a little long winded in places. Love love looooooove it!

I have just returned from seeing this movie with my family and had to write an honest review to counter the many unfairly negative reviews, some of which I read with trepidation just before we went.All I can say is if you have a heart, a healthy imagination and love a good old fashioned tearjeking story with a feel good factor you will love this movie.I never thought I would say it, but Tim Burton has absolutely outdone himself and his remake leaves the animated original in its sparklingly dark circus dust.Everyone in my family loved it and my two daughters said it was their favourite movie ever, which is a really big deal coming from them as they are both pretty discerning teenage movie buffs.We loved the story, the characters, the CGI effects and the soundtrack and of course Dumbo is just the most huggable CGI creation ever.We all cried and laughed throughout and it has a real modern day moral to the story that I think is lost on those who would prefer to pick fault with minor issues, highlight CGI technicalities and criticise child actors as if they're reviewing a factual documentary.Come on - it's about a flying elephant!! If you are not willing to suspend your disbelief whilst watching it then just don't go to see it. But don't try to slate it for others who still BELIEVE in movie magic!If I remember correctly The Greatest Showman also received similarly negative, petty and pedantic reviews at the outset before real people who actually watched it started talking and turned it into a huge worldwide hit.Time will tell with Dumbo - but it will be a firm family favourite for us that we will rewatch again and again.Thank you Tim Burton for keeping a little bit of magic alive in our hearts!",Dumbo

The Postman Pat Movie more or less did this plot.

But upon coming out, I'm really not sure what exactly is so bad about it?Yeah there are moments when the acting is a bit suspect from those you wouldn't expect it to be, the imagery and artistry used is either love it or hate it and there are definite plot holes and things that don't make sense... but if we're honest, you don't come to a film about an elephant with ears so big it enables it to fly... to find realism.Personally I thought it was quite enjoyable. It was really well paced and had some fun moments in it too. Colin Farrell put in a good showing and the graphics and visual effects were definitely not scimped out on. But most of all the film ends on a good note, and makes you feel good when you come out from watching it. It's a happy film, and a film I think children will like, which after all is what they were really going for. I don't regret using a few hours of my day on it at all... and don't think many people going really will.Don't listen to the hate, though it must be said, I haven't seen the original, and I guess in some ways that disqualifies me from having a completely valid opinion.",Dumbo

344,jacktheraperx,A politically correct mess with nothing to say,1,5 April 2019,"This film should be catalogued as animal cruelty for what Tim Burton did to poor Dumbo.This must be the worst Disney film I've ever seen and it's an insult to the surreal vision of love and triumph over overwhelming odds that was the original.
How can it be that the animated version is far more mature and intelligent than the live action one?How can my intelligence feel so insulted by a movie with absolutely no heart and no brain to a point that when I feel compelled to tell people to avoid this like the plague? The movie doesn't make up its mind about what it wants to say or what it wants to be. Is it a critic to Disney buying small (and huge) properties? Does it want to send a ""family"" message? Does it want to say that doesn't matter how you are born (big ears), what you like (science) or what happened to you (losing an arm) it's ok because it's you who matters? No, it doesn't dwell on any of it because god forgive we give the children something to actually think about and have 2 or 3 upset moms feel offended that a movie told their children to be strong in the face of adversity.No, the biggest intelligible lesson from this film is ""when in doubt snort something"" which is a really questionable choice for a film that tries to be as politically correct as possible. I prefer the crows teaching me and Dumbo to believe in yourself even when you lost your mom and and the world seems to be against you.There was a reason why the original was a hit and has become a classic even despite its period derived racism which as a non white I have to say never saw the racism in.Oh yeah, that's another thing, you really wanted to correct the so called ""racism"" from the original? Why not make the family that gets Dumbo through the rough stuff positive black role models?Only positive thing about it?

The movie vilifies rational thinking and prices vandalism; the supposed heroes of this movie made more damage than the supposed villain ( like that little girl at the end of Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom ). Disney thinks that because they are the lead their actions are automatically justified and the audience must think so.Just like Alice In Wonderland 2010, Dumbo is a total tonal mess:Tim Burton + Disney = No no.Yes, The Nightmare before Christmas despite not being directed by Burton worked, because it was more Burton's than Disney's, therefore Disney disowned it back then and sold it to theaters under the Touchstone Pictures banner. It wasn't until Burton and the Nightmare Before Christmas reached cult status that that Disney beg him to come back.
But that movie fitted Burton's always present dark and gothic/german expressionistic sensibilities which don't fit with anything else that Disney has ever made.A Burton and Disney attempted balance is the equivalent of a cinematic Frankenstein that you can tell which parts belong to who's and which don't belong with each other.Two stars, one for the always great Michael Keaton that sold me all of his bad lines, and other star for Eva Green's Oscar nominated costume design.",Dumbo

Noisy, hammy and devoid of all charm and wit. In fact the ridiculously unrealistic noises that Dumbo was making I found irksome.

I had different elements made to engage a younger audience. It has more levels than an elephant missing his mother. It shows animal cruelty and how it is wrong.

I was willing to suspend disbelief that the two children were supposed to come from the same parents, just more Disney PC garbage - who cares but at least get actors that can act! Even over the top acting would have been better than this. Thandie Newton is an excellent actress but unfortunately it obviously hasn't rubbed off on her daughter. I know it was her debut but the cgi Dumbo acted better so I can only assume this was a favour. As for the movie itself, where was the music and the songs?

It will pull on your heartstrings. The opening acts of the mother's love for her baby elephant, baby Jumbo, who becomes (Dumbo) from being laughed at for his big ears. The final separation his mother will bring a tear to your eye.
The acting is solid, Danny Devito is wonderful. Eva Green shines as Dumbos high-flying acrobat partner. And It was fun to watch Michael Keaton as the over-the-top, power-hungry amusement park owner, who goes into a mad doctor rage by the end of the film.
As with all Burton's films, it has his dark side and it fits appropriately.
It's a beautiful picture, and meant to be seen on the big screen.
If you've had reservations about seeing the movie because of all the so-called critics... don't. See it on the big screen while you still can. But there a some very sad moments in the film, which as I wrote earlier, will pull on your heartstrings. Both young and old alike.

It seems people these days love nothing more than tearing everything to shreds.This Disney movie did it's job. Magic and goodness and being your unique self, beating the bad guys in rich visual style. And great to see the message of how horrible it is to use animals as if they have no right to a life without suffering.Sure it's simplified, but that's what Disney is - morality that children can understand, symbolism that reminds adults to keep the inner child alive.Why so many comments about bad acting? Tim Burton uses caricatures, they're supposed to be exaggerated symbols. And Tim Burton's visual artistry is always a treat with that gorgeous touch of gothic.I'm so sick of haters who always have to project their jaded, narrow viewpoints onto everything.",Dumbo

First exactly for that. Burton made a new story (How dare he???). Second, because he uses his ""characteristic environment"", dull and sad scenes and a lot of sound. Then the guy finds the movie ""heartless"". I found the exact opposite.What bothered me, and then maybe is this way because there is the Disney-Movie-Kids-Youth issue in the middle, is that some characters in some scenes make, say, childish and counterproductive decisions. Keaton's character, for example. Want to dominate the circus world without circus. And Eva Green's character has a very fast twist, but ok.Finaly, even if it's taking some bad decisions, when it comes to ""rewrite"", that the others filmmakers be as brave as Burton has always been - as in the case of his first Alice and Planet of the Apes.

371,brianbarnett-492-73980,You May Like It,2,30 March 2019,"You may like it, I did not. I literally just walked out of this movie with about ten minutes left to go. Honestly, I had stopped caring an hour earlier. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was for my 4-year-old daughter. But SHE lost interest an hour in, and when she finally fell asleep, I called it quits.Let me tell you what the trailers were that preceded this movie: What else? New 'live-action' Lion King, and new live-action Aladdin. I caught myself wondering what Disney is actually going to do once they're all out of remakes to successful past movies (when the art and storytelling was emphasized) and they actually have to come up with something new? Well, we all know the answer to that, don't we? They'll just buy out a whole other studio.Dumbo was atrocious. It was a dumbed-down (I intended that wording) train wreck for modern audiences who have few expectations beyond decent CGI.Apparently, the idea of including Dumbo's friend the mouse in any full capacity which would be loyal to the original was too unbelievable in a movie where an elephant can flap around and fly with his ears...Have you noticed that Disney, in addition to remaking all of their hits, is also dumbing down all of their hits? This is because people will go see it. When I say 'dumbing down', I'm talking about having to explain everything so that there is an illusion of more complexity, but really they know people just aren't capable of filling in blanks or connecting dots anymore. So their going into greater detail and explaining everything is actually for the benefit of all the idiots in the audience who can't simply buy into fairy tales on their own merit.The acting was atrocious. The young actress who played the new character part invented for this movie was probably the worst actress in the history of cinema. She delivers her lines exactly like you would imagine her reading them off a piece of paper. Yes, really. In three-sentence fragments, like a headstrong robot with zero emotion. Honestly, when I say she's bad, I mean she's horrid. If you see it with me having told you this in mind, you won't be able to unsee it.Oh, and Dumbo is a superhero. He flies around through flames saving children and adults and doing other dramatic superhero things. But God forbid Disney allows the mouse to talk or play a bigger role, or for crows to sing. No, no, no... that's just TOO much.I'll say one positive thing: Colin Farrell was great, and I actually felt terrible for him. Yes, I'm sure he made more in this one film than any normal person makes in a lifetime. Still, you could tell he was not phoning in his effort, even though he had to have known the movie itself was a completely artless piece of $#@*. So kudos to him for his pride in his work despite everything.Please. Do not reward this type of money-grabbing behavior on the part of Disney.

372,thirtynard-728-574812,Not For Kids,3,17 April 2019,"After watching this version of ""Dumbo"" with our 4-year-old granddaughter, I can see why so many young adults are neurotic, anxiety-ridden, maladjusted and depressed if this is the kind of thing that forms their childhood memories. This film was, for the most part, dark and somber from beginning to end, the plot development dull and predictable, and the acting awkward, wooden versions of characters we've seen in hundreds of other films. This was honestly an embarrassment for Disney, and I'm very surprised (shocked, actually) to see it averages a 6.6 in user reviews. If Danny DeVito figured this movie would recreate the magic of ""Matilda"", he was sadly mistaken; even his performance was subpar and bland.

Yes, there were many characters and storylines that did not get fully developed, however, the main focus was on Dumbo himself. The cute, little animated elephant Burton created really drew me and captured my heart. All the scenery, colors, costumes and camera angles kept me in the circus vibe all throughout the film. The only real downside to this film was the lack of emotional connection I created with the characters. Dumbo and his Mama showed more love to each other than the father and his kids. If the actors would have put in the same amount of effort as the animators, then this film would easily achieve 10 stars.",Dumbo

Yes, a scientist! Oh brother. And yet her little brother tags along everywhere she goes mindlessly living moment-to-moment with no aspirations whatsoever. Ah how cute, typical toxic male characteristics. Then there is the super-evil corporate giant who wants to own it all, yet at the cost of destroying everything. Enough already with the nonsense. Yes we get it, we all should hate business enterprise and greed because ultimately they will destroy the earth and put us all in chains - at least what's left of us.Except for one Danny DeVito the cast just stumbles through the whole mess. They all look like the overly starched shirts of the times. They deliver their lines as if they're suffering from bad hangovers.Disney really needs to get back on track.

The script is fine I guess, not done for someone like me but I think it works.Cinematography & Camera: It looks like a big production but I didnt really like the looks of the movie. While I'm not a big fan of Tim Burton, I usually like his creative way of showing the world around the place the movie takes place which there was very little of in this movie. That big festivalground later in the movie had some of it and I enjoyed seeing that.What I never liked with Tim Burton is his overly and artificial cleanliness of so many of the scenes and there was a lot of this in this movie.But what takes the rotten cake is dumbo itself unfortunately. Those eyes. They haunt me.Sound: No scene can live without music. Its mindnumbing. Thats not a problem of this movie alone but take Disney classics (either remade or original) as a whole, not a scene can stand on its own without music. I'm exaggerating of course but you get the point.The sound and music is pre-chewing the emotions you supposed to feel and is spoonfeeding it to you.Acting: Unfortunately the acting is bad with some exceptions, namely Danny DeVito who atleast tries.The child actors didnt click with me whatsoever and Collin Farrel, which I honestly love to see in a movie, disappointed me.Final Thoughts: Skip it.

378,kjreiter,Another world I'm glad not to live in,2,27 December 2019,"I was excited to hear that Disney was doing a live action version of the beloved classic, Dumbo. But my expectations dropped when I heard Tim Burton was directing. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed many of his movies and I find his quirky settings to be artful and unique. He makes visually interesting sets unlike any other. But he goes too far. Especially for Disney films. It seems lately that he is more interested in creating an eerie, whimsical, haunting setting, than making a great story. The setting and color of this film is dreary, spooky, and sad. Typical Tim Burton. He did the same to Wonderland, Wonka's Chocolate Factory, Gotham City, Sleepy Hollow, and more. The places he creates are just strange and disturbing. For some stories it's entirely appropriate, but not for a Disney movie. That's why this movie and the Alice in Wonderland movies fail before they even begin. The mood is wrong. I'm glad i don't live in a Tim Burton world. Now that I beat the daylight out of the weird setting and drab color of the film, the story and characters were not good either. The whole movie feels mean and sad. It's one mean act or horrible scene after another. This movie lacks any joy whatsoever. When it was done, it made me hate all circuses and maybe that was actually Burton's goal. He's a sly genius if that was the plan, but I doubt it. Disney, please stop hiring Tim Burton or at least rein him in. His vision and and artistic direction is not as good as he thinks it is. Not everything needs to be weird. It's about the story.

I actually had faith in this one but it's completely eradicated. Save your money and watch the classic. This isn't the film you want to see.Also, it feels so long. They changed it so dumbo doesn't have the mouse as a best friend anymore. Please don't waste time. For Disney: Please do better because we are losing so much faith in you.Edit: Post film, I will say the special effects were great. My least favorite aspect were the children. Extremely emotionless!

There was no single person in the full room who enjoyed it. Many people were napping, some were on their phones. The rest were bored to death.
Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. The color palette was typical for Burton, washed down and bleak. The actors played like they had firing line pointed at them. Most of the characters were flat like an ironing board. No character development at all. Dany DeVito was really trying to have this circus going on, but the clowns were suicidal.

The original dumbo ends at the circus, now he is beloved by all and reuinited with his mother, but he is still a circus animal. This story ends with dumbo and his mother in the jungle, and dumbo spreads his ears and he flies as far and free as he want. And oh, no words could describe the absolute magic of seeing him truly soar around the circus tents for the first time. don't let the jaded, cynical, ""adult"" reviewers fool you. This movie is imperfect, but it's magic.",Dumbo

I would say that Tim Burton is back with his originality and unique approach directing movies. I dare to say this is 2019 version of best Tim Burton's movie from 90s era.This story and this movie is different heartwarming unique and brings back some innocent emotions in child and adult.I think this will be movie that will bring critique and public to the same conclusion it is beautiful to discover innocence and purity of heart in yourself.I'm so so glad I decided to watch this movie!",Dumbo
401,Duraznitot,Don't expect it to be like the original movie,6,31 March 2019,"This was a fine movie. The CGI is really well done (Like in all Disney movies), specially the sequence that ""remakes"" the pink elephants on parade scene, my favorite of the original movie. The acting is okay, nothing special to be honest, it's what would you expect from a family movie. Regarding the soundtrack we don't have as many songs as in the animated movie, sadly.However, I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie. The storyline is way different, the original movie basically was Dumbo trying to meet with his mother again (and the mouse helping him) and learning some values on the way, apart from finding his flying talent. This version in a nutshell is Dumbo doing things with many human characters, we don't see his interest of meeting with his mother again so much like in the previously mentioned version. Also, the movie has many sub-plots that don't really develop and that don't add much.In conclusion, it's an okay movie but don't expect it to be a masterpiece and of course don't expect it to be like the original Dumbo movie. The only similar things are the main characters (Except the mouse, why would they remove him from the film?) and that there's a circus.",Dumbo

405,choitaejin,A surprisingly bland retelling,2,29 December 2019,"For some inexplicable reason, the production team of Dumbo decided to rip out every great aspect of the original and fill the resulting void with a jarring narrative that neither suits the story nor the intended audience.
I'm completely fine with reboots to classics, but changes such as the gimmick of Dumbo's cocaine-like snorting of the feather to attain flight - completely defeats the entire story-line of what made the original such a classic.Danny DeVito was a standout performance and Eva Green was amazing too (as always) - unfortunately neither were unable to save the jagged direction and narrative choices of this movie.",Dumbo

It does nerf a lot of what made the original movie good, but makes up for it with a good story, and many of the adult actors are pretty funny. The children, on the other hand, seem very robotic, and they're pretty bland. On a final note, this movie has a style that's lacking from the other live action remakes, and it definitely deserves some attention. It may not be an Oscar worthy movie and it's definitely not an above average movie, but it is very solid and pretty good.",Dumbo

What did I expect from this movie? Not a clone of the original that's for sure, and it isn't, so why all the haters?
Tim Burton as a director, I expected something different and a twist and a darker movie, yes it was, admittedly I was no impressed by the girl flying him, it didn't look right but I can live with that.
Storyline, pretty simple really and as for too many people, it's a live action film, not a cartoon where animals are easier to draw maybe.
In general, I really enjoyed this film, Dumbo was awesome, DeVito excellent and I would recommend",Dumbo

Mostly by being mad and very seldom for being touched or moved.90% of the movie I was really annoyed by the human characters. I didn't feel connected nor had empathy for any of them.Literally, the best performance is done by - the best character - a CGI elephant. The whole movie relays completelly on the fact it looks extremely cute.So, if you want to watch a sad story with mediocre acting and a cute elephant, go on and see this movie.

And Dumbo himself was cute and you do feel a sense of magic when he soars, I really believe this film betters the Disney original more so than the new Aladdin remake that badly miscast Jafar. Just really well made classic Hollywood cinema with a great score and solid direction. And Visually its a trip! Yes it can be a little dark in spots but aren't the best fairytales?

Well Disney has once again discovered how to do just that. The have ruined a wonderful story that had an important message and turned it dark with needles a d unwanted political correctness. Tim Burton who is good at what he does was a horrible choice for a family friendly Disney movie. Even with the talent of the adult actors you could tell they new they were making flop because for the most part they just phoned in their roll or went so far over the top that they seemed like they were spoofing their own movie. Disney also used to bring in great new talent however the young actors in this movie were absolutely horrible.

417,maxvox-96919,"Lifeless, phony, plastic junk",1,17 July 2019,"Wow, how far we have fallen. The original was touching and poignant. It had offbeat, slightly edgy characters like a mouse who has too much to drink and a quartet of crows (singing ""When I See an Elephant Fly""). Masterpieces of song and illusion. Remember the hallucinagenic ""Pink Elephants on Parade""? It had scenes like the one where Dumbo visits his mother in prison and has to unwrap trunks from her and go back to his cage, that make even the hardest-nosed movie goer weep.With this new version, ugh.
Okay, the practical. The actors, every single one of them except DeVito, are clumsy, plastic, and about as good as a high school musical.
The plot? Suddenly we have to have an ""evil"" guy, ranting, flailing diabolically at a futuristic electronic control panel? What the heck is this doing in the story of Dumbo?Oh, and Arcade Fire's recording of ""Baby Mine"" is simply awful.

First, the hue or color tone of the movie was so unnatural, almost campy, like I had stumbled into a showing of Batman and Robin. It distracted me constantly reminding me that I was at the movies watching actors instead of being part of a story. Secondly, the young female actress did not help that situation at all. She presence was very distracting. Her acting was wooden and unbelievable. She was a carny's kid, living in a circus in 1919 but in every scene, she looked like she had just gotten out of the shower. It was hard to watch.
Finally, who is green lighting these Disney's screenplays? Fire all of them!

Obviously, the main character and his mum were brilliantly created, but It wasn't a constant go-to.As a nostalgic who grew up with this story, I totally engaged with it and It made me revisit an amazing Disney classic.I read as a ""bad point"" that animals were not part of this circus and that wasn't faithful to the context. However, I think this is an amazing choice and a great message against animal abuse. I couldn't think of a better ending.However, I got EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED by the director. Where is Tim Burton in this film?? We can see clearly the constraints of working for Disney, but I think it could have been easily directed by someone else.

They end up sending Dumbo back to Africa with his mother, and the Midici Bothers (or however you spell that) Show keeps on going like Dumbo never existed.
The thing I hated most about this movie was the dark atmosphere throughout the whole movie. Granted, there were some bright colors, but even still it felt very dark and moody. Not only was the look moody, but the people were too. I mean, the kids were sad because their mother died, and the dad comes back from the war with one arm. Why? This is supposed to be a fun and happy story! Why do we have to make it dark and depressing? Did I mention the kids are terrible actors? The girl speaks in monotone and never smiles! Is she supposed to be that way, I don't know? There are numerous other negative things I could say about this movie. Pretty much the only thing I liked was how stinking cute Dumbo looked. His eyes are huge(not to mention his ears, haha), and he just has this sweet innocent look about him. Another ""con"" though, he isn't really the main focus in the movie. How disturbing is that? I mean, what's the point if the main character isn't really even the main focus? Come on people! The best thing that happened in this movie? - the bad guy gets his just reward in the end.

I watch it 1.1x fast, cuz there are many scene like freeze and nothing happens you just stare at one think.. After all we don't watch drama this should be a funny movie not a drama movie with some fantacy.. They loose a lot of star here..

468,les1466,Wow what's with all the bad reviews??,10,14 June 2019,"I am absolutely gobsmacked that this has been slated so badly??? I personally thought it was absolutely fantastic. The fx, story and acting were amazing... I'm really scratching my head as to why people are, seemingly, going out of their way to slag it off?? So much so I've wrote a review.
Maybe they were expecting an actual remake of the original cartoon. Ok, the story line was different but not in a bad way.
It was done in Tim Burtons excellent stylised way. If you don't like Tim burtons films then yes, this will probably not rock your boat. However, if you like his Alice In Wonderland, you'll absolutely love it.Are people spoilt with film technology these days that they become over critical at things that may have the slightest of flaws, or or has the world just become a load of winge bags because nothing is sacred because technology allows it.I normally take reviews in off IMDB as a reference when watching a film. This certainly was not one of them; and would gladly watch this with my future grand children, great nephews, nieces and wife... Again!!World, get a grip! See the beauty in what something is instead of being so negative!!",Dumbo

The casting is near perfect, especially DeVito, Keaton and Eva Green. The visuals and production design are truly amazing and the movie is not without charm.

475,lgilpin-75291,Tale of two halves,4,30 March 2019,"The first half of the movie was fantastic, the emotional parts hit home, the scenery looked amazing and the acting was good enough. However the second half felt like a completely different movie and felt boring and slow. However the last act of the movie was enjoyable. (Spoiler) having the main villain being a theme park owner who park is based on dreams and buys other acts (sound familiar) was kinda weird from a Disney movie. Why would the villain be someone in a similar position to Walt Disney and for me that was hard to overlook. The first half was very good and flys by plus the good ending makes up of for most of the second half of the film",Dumbo

477,joaoaoaoj,"Messy plot, ruined by political correctness",1,5 May 2020,"This movie seems like it was made from a movie making machine. Very soulless.The art style was fine, but a bit underwhelming. I would expect something more creative coming from Tim Burton. In fact, there was a lot of room to be more creative in a movie like Dumbo.Then the choice of the main charecter not being Dumbo was something that I disliked. To be honest, it could have worked well. But not in this case.Instead the main characters were very unlikable. No personality at all. A kid that wouldn't do anything interesting. And his sister, which was the main one. She was just annoying.The directors were too politically correct, and that ruined the film. She was half black, talked in a very empowering way, wanted to be a scientist and would literally say that she wanted to be recognized by her brain.Nothing wrong with being black, or being an empowered women. My problem is how unnecessary, obvious and cliché it was. Very forced. It had no soul and killed the characters. Seems like they went for the most politically correct thing they could go to.Another complain that I have is how messy the movie was. They had an interesting plot in the begining. But in the end a lot of things happened too quickly. Many things haooened at once. And suddenly Dumbo became a super hero saved everything.It sounded like they were too lazy and did not know how to end it",Dumbo

Disney should be ashamed.
Tim Burton should be ashamed.
The screenwriters should be ashamed.
The actors should be ashamed.
Most of all the visual effects supervisor should be ashamed.The visual effects were third rate. I cannot begin to express how awful and unrealistic they are. And this is the 21st century. The story was pointless-muddled as to who the narrative is about. In a cliche summary: this is two hours of my life I will not get back. I hope I will have saved you that.",Dumbo

If I have to criticize it in any way it would have to be Collin Ferrill's horrible Southern accent. But beyond that it's a good family movie.",Dumbo
482,floatingdriftwood,A Touching Adaptation,10,1 April 2019,"I loved Dumbo as a young child, but it didn't stay with me the way many other Disney movies did. However, I am a Tim Burton fan (though he's made missteps in the past) so I was curious about this adaptation without high expectations. I was blown away the emotional punch it packs. The human characters created for the movie are a nice addition and well-cast. The human story is simple and moves the original Dumbo story forward in a way that feels familiar, but fresh. Unlike the other Disney remakes, Dumbo may not have princes and princesses, but it's a dazzling spectacle with a lot of heart.",Dumbo
483,yappymuch,True Disney,10,6 April 2019,Loved this movie! Brought to life by the main actor Dumbo who brought home how hard it is to sometimes be different and different types of love such as in a family or friends. Bringing together a circus who banded together. As a kid I loved the cartoon and as adult loved this modern version.,Dumbo
484,carlahandy-39723,Actually pretty good?!,8,28 April 2019,"I was put off going to watch dumbo because of the bad critic reviews but then I've seen films before that critics have raved about that have been awful.

485,pbc23,Story isn't the worst ... acting is.,5,21 July 2019,"Collin Ferrell's accent is terrible. He also just doesn't do anything for the story. The little girl is just plane awful. I guess she's supposed to be tragic, but it comes across as just lame. Terrible script writing with cheesy one-liners. Pretty uninteresting and disappointing all around. Capped off with a ridiculous political plug at the end about animals being held against their will. Good grief.",Dumbo
486,surjitbiswasin,Lack of character depth!!,4,18 June 2019,"I thought it would be an other wonder by Disney but ended up in a disappointment. The characters simply kept flowing in a manner that didn't have any depth go it. In other words, the movie seemed to lack heart and soul of the genre. The story is strong but the depiction and enactment wasn't impressive.Got bored towards the end and that happens rarely with Disney films.",Dumbo

490,wonderfullyberry,I'm not too GROWN UP to love this movie!,9,10 April 2019,"Was this movie PERFECT? No. But...it was very enjoyable.
I'm confused as to what other people are needing...
Great actors? This has that. An interesting story? Got it. Stunning visuals? Check. Drama? Sad moments? Happy moments? Nostalgia? Fantastic score? Elements from the original? A warm fuzzy ending? PINK ELEPHANTS?!! (It has all those things).
In this day of opinions and people depending on screens to LIVE...I think we've forgotten the magic of the ORIGINAL screen. What happened to just going to a movie, and enjoying it for what it is? What is so EXCITING about your life that you find this boring? Umm there are a couple circuses and a freaking flying elephant in this movie!! To me, that's interesting enough.
And the sweet sweet storyline between Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo. Perhaps only the moms out there can relate...but there is NOTHING like the bond between a mama and her baby, and I loved that the story had a great deal of that to offer.I love Tim Burton, and I think he did a really wonderful job with this movie.
I dare you to go see it and leave your judgment in the car.",Dumbo
491,manuelasomorre,It was cute but drawn out throughout the movie,8,14 June 2019,"Instead of making it a whimsical movie for kids or adults to stay focused, it just ended up feeling like they had to throw everything in that really didn't need to be there. IMHO",Dumbo

So what about this film, I wanted to love it, it's a Disney film and Dumbo so must be great right?! Sadly not, unfortunately it was a Tim Burton film not a Disney film, so what's wrong with that? Tim Burton films can be very good, but they are very distinctively Tim Burtons films, this needed to be Disney, needed to be cute, needed to be sad.... it was none of these unfortunately. It was however okay but nothing more.",Dumbo
494,ckwf,Thank you Tim Burton.,5,30 March 2019,"First of all, thanks Tim for putting aspects of the original in this film. It made it so much more fun to watch. From the train (giant smiley face), the stork (landed on front of the train before Jumbo gave birth to Jumbo Jr, who would be later named Dumbo), the bubble elephants ( I thought was choreographed perfectly) and even the line ""you've seen a horse fly, you've seen a dragon fly and you've even seen a house fly! But you've never seen an elephant fly, (reference to ""when I see an elephant fly,"" a song from the original). He even has Timothy mouse!!Second I extremely enjoyed this movie. The only think I can say was the start was a little.... too fast if you know what I'm saying?? And the lighting was a little off at times. Proving this movie was fantastic, considering those are the only things I can complain about. I turned 15 when this movie came out and Dumbo is one of my favourite Disney films of all time. Thanks Tim for not ruining this delightful movie and for making hard to choose which I prefer, the original or this one. Dumbo was so adorable, the effects were stunning and the cast was spot on. Every scene had a purpose, you take out a scene and the story won't make sense (which is rare for movies nowadays). I don't want to make this review too long. So I'm going to wrap it up hereI was deeply engaged. The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you haven't seen the original or you hold a grudge against Tim for ""Charlie"" remake. I recommend all ages, even the elderly who probably saw Dumbo as a kid. This is appropriate for all ages I believe. Thanks Tim for not ruining this I loved it. 9/10 for me.",Dumbo

It was pure delight and exactly how he envisioned it. If you didnt like it then that is your loss. But reviews are not supposed to be for the haters it's for the lovers so others can enjoy and reccomend movies. So to all the 1 reviewer critics get Tim Burton's spectacular vision and artistic way of taking Disney movies and resurrecting them into new beautiful life.

Basically I didn't know what to expect because I had only seen one preview. However, I realized that it was outstanding from 10 minutes in. There is only one movie that I cried more at and that was The Passion of the Christ. But this movie, at least 72% of the time, I was crying. It will probably never get an Oscar, but I think it deserves one. This is the best ""live action"" film from a previous animation that Disney has ever done. Thank you to all who made this movie so special, especially Tim Burton.",Dumbo
507,craphead_is_a_compliment,The elephant in the room,2,4 April 2019,"First of all I rarely review movies on here, in fact it's my first review in literally 10 plus years but I was so annoyed and upset that a film I have loved and held dear for years, an absolute classic and one of my favourite animated films has been ruined, it really is an insult to the original. I went with my four nieces to see this and spent a lot of money and wish to god I hadn't. To describe how bad this was just look at all the reviews that said this was forced, an obvious cash cow, lacking the soul and heart of the original, well they hit the nail on the head and I had a feeling this movie weren't going to be great but I was curious anyway and the kids wanted to see it so I thought why not? The original is a classic and actually made me cry, that's how good and touching it was, this remake also made me cry as it was so bad and they might as well have just killed dumbo, this movie was awful. I will admit the cgi was ok and dumbo and his mother were good but the human characters and the plot was total crap and a complete waste of time. Burton, Disney and whoever else came up with this crap and allowed it to go ahead should be ashamed, it's just a money printing movie with no plot and this doesn't bode well for Aladdin and the lion king and based on the strength of this I won't bother with the latter two. Disney, you had your chance and ruined it. This is a reminder to me why I rarely go to the cinema as it's expensive and most films are crap nowadays. I have just lost the will to live and wish I could get my money back. Anyone reading this and thinking of paying good money to see this at the cinema think again. The kids might like it...maybe but you probably won't and I'm not going to reward the film industry anymore that just seems to keep pushing out rubbish like this. Whatever happened to plot and story and characters?? It's just overblown cgi and nonsense that is not memorable at all. I almost want to cry as this movie is just an insult to the original. When they first announced they was remaking dumbo my first thought was no, leave well alone. It's a classic and you'll only ruin it. Looks like my prediction was correct. Please stay away from this mess and if you absolutely have to see it make sure you don't pay for it, Disney doesn't deserve your money, they deserve shooting.",Dumbo

The visuals of the background were not as good as I've come to expect, but I carried on as it was only a few minutes in and I didn't want to give up hope. My mood changed once I saw Danny DeVito. He presence gives more substance to the movie and overall was good to watch him. The rest of the characters, including the leads, do not really leave a lasting impression on you and are easily forgettable.The elephants are well presented (visually) on the screen, and Dumbo himself is sweet and he makes you fall for him, however he is somewhat lost in the story of good vs evil.

It was nicely done except for the part of the evil circus. That was a little too cliche and did nothing to boost the story. The acting was good, and the animation was really phenomenal. Sometimes, I wondered if there were real elephants in the film, the animation is so good. I liked it mostly because of the acting. There is nothing worse than an actor or actress who just does not suit the character they are supposed to portray, and that did not happen in this movie. The major limitation was Alan Arkin's character. It either needs to be eliminated or built up more. Danny DeVito was good and could have watched more of him, and Alex Keaton was good.

Clearly your negativity and disappointment make up ALL the difference in this industry, so thank you.The film was phenomenal.

At the end however Dumbo stole the show for me. I am amazed how well the live cast did with nothing to look at. Thought it was much better than several of the recent Disney re-releases.

529,belaroo,Missing a soundtrack,3,25 February 2020,"I loved the original. The message of this new interpretation is well meaning. As a story it lacked plausibility, nothing to do with fantasy, Zootopia was more plausible. Some of the plot devics borrowed and reinterpreted from the original were clever, others wasted. It lacked a soundtrack, the music was utterly forgettable an where they touched on the original, it seemed half-hearted. The dialogue was dull and unoriginal, the action lent lazily on an over used formula, goodies were good, baddies bad. Only Danny got much character development. It feels like any attempt to create something new it was throttled by ridgid expectations from a board of dullards on high within Disney. Unusual for Tim Burton to skimp both on imaginative dialogue and stand out music. The cinematography and acting were on track, just missed opportunities to bring the message across with music and humour. A great pity, this film had so much promise.",Dumbo

I really really did; when I saw the trailer, I was so excited and ready to be wowed once again by Disney's magic, but instead was greeted to a monotonous, joyless hour and a half that I'll never get back. Baby Dumbo himself was very cute, and a few chuckles from Danny DeVito, were there but that's literally all the film had to offer.The script was very dull and it seemed to rely on CGI way too much. The actress who played the daughter was ridiculously robotic and had the emotional range of a comatose patient. Like, just because she's supposed to be smart means she can't be interesting too?I didn't think it was possible for Disney to be this lackluster, but anything is possible I guess",Dumbo

I found myself very bored most of the film.

537,isaacreynolds-92344,Snore inducing.,5,5 April 2019,"There isn't any easier way to say it than, 2019's Dumbo is utterly dull and boring. Almost everything about it is so uninteresting and bland that it feels like it's trying it's best to make you take a nap. The performances weren't all bad, Danny Devito was competent and enjoyable at times, Colin Firth did an okay job, however Michael Keaton was underwhelming which is always a disappointment. But the children, specifically the little girl who gets a large chunk of screen time; she is the absolute worst. He face doesn't change, her tone of voice doesn't change and her overall character is frustratingly insufferable and it's established from her very first scene and she doesn't change or develop at all. I couldn't stand her.Dumbo seemed to be the only saving grace of the entire film. Scenes with Dumbo was mildly exciting and cute, when he was on screen I was basically awake, but Dumbo and even having a director like Tim Burton couldn't even save this movies visuals, because it looks as grey as an elephant itself. I wasn't expecting much from Dumbo going in, what I did get was a competent movie but at the same time it almost bored me to tears.",Dumbo

539,mbeggens,Looks great but filled with unnecessary characters and story,2,1 April 2019,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie and came out disappointed.
I've watched the original Dumbo cartoon a lot when I was a child, and remember it to be dark and very sad but with a happy ending.Watching this movie I did not feel that emotion at all. Kind of like to how the children in this movie act. There was no emotional connection between the children and little baby elephant with huge ears. The only look the little girl could do was smile, look pretty and have a fake tear on her cheek.As a circus with (fake) freaks they would have been blessed to have a real baby elephant with those big ears, and the audience would have loved everything about it. I understand the original cartoon they also laugh at Dumbo, but that's because he is very clumsy with those big ears.They way the script has been written to make Dumbo unwanted just does not work. I really miss the mouse Timothy. The children are not a good replacement because of the bad acting.The first 45 minutes of the movie consists of the original story of the cartoon and I expected to see the end credits roll, and that would have been fine.
But then the movie drags on with the story making it over the top and laughable.Like when the woman starts to ride Dumbo looks really silly. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and just started laughing. Michael Keaton is trying to perform a role as bad guy, but he turns out being just stupid when he starts smashing the power station of his circus destroying everything he owns.Also to see Dumbo gets risen up to perform his flying trick for like 4 times in a row got really boring at the end. We've seen him fly multiple times allready!
And why does Dumbo have to snort up this feather like it's his drug or something. In the cartoon he just holds the feather, not snort it.A lot of bad decisions made this movie a big mess. Dumbo looks cute though.",Dumbo
540,liviharris,My three kids loved it,8,2 April 2019,"I'm not too sure about the reviews on here, and most times I don't get the harsh reviews. We took our three kids to see this movie today and each one of them loved it. Afterwards, When I asked if anyone liked it... My oldest's exact words: ""I liked it! I really LOVED it"" lol and the two younger ones (8 and 5) told me their favorite parts.Dumbo is super cute and the storyline is relatable as of course young kiddos don't want to be away from their mommies and how the mamas are so protective of their kids. We were all happy and entertained with the storyline and ending.I removed two stars because one, I did think that the oldest kid (Millie) seemed like she didn't have any emotions, she was kind of a blank slate but maybe she's just DONE with emotions and easier to feel nothing because of her parents situation you know.And two, I wish that the tone for the movie was a bit brighter for longer. It kinda looked dark mostly throughout the movie but after watching it, I get the point but STILL lol give me some bright colors.",Dumbo

This takes up almost half the movie! This isn't too bad by itself but adding in the bad and unstylistic camera angles: specifically bad when we are introduced to the movie, wonder land and the end.

The point of a remake is to make it some what different...but anyways. The plot was amazing, Tim Burton did amazing as usual, and it's exactly what I was hoping for.

Then the real-persons acting. Danny was great, but for the rest... These actors just don't work together.
I was expecting so much from this movie. Dumbo is a classic piece from my childhood, like many people out there. The trippy scene from the animation movie with the soaps, it also exists in this one, but my god... my heart still hurts.1 star for Danny

But, some things in life is best to leave untouched, this is one of those things. The film seems to focus more about the people rather than the elephant. Dumbo is cute, but that's is. Everything else is basically crap. The only emotion this film will bring is, frustration. I didn't even watch the whole film, I couldn't manage it. It was just impossible.

The rest of the characters where great.Now the story line is very emotional & yes, dark.... But what Time Burton fill isn't?Dumbo.... Oh man, those eyes! The character himself makes your heart melt & explode with cuteness.When he is trying to save the monkey & he flies is so magical. I was in awe. Each time he continues to fly, I felt the same!Ultimately in the end, the sadness & darkness of the film is put aside.

Disney seemed to figure that a childhood classic with a flying elephant needed something, more, if it was going to be a ""live action"" reboot. So they insert a random circus family, give us the most thin reason why we should care at all about them, then make them a hearty focus of the movie with Dumbo playing sidekick.All of the human actors are very annoying and add nothing to the movie. Definitely not a ""reboot"" as much a plain and clear cash grab with the least care of good story telling.",Dumbo

Story becomes a mess, loses focus, tries too hard and ends up being about everything except Dumbo.
This is clearly in the ""B"" line of remakes and that's really sad.
Disney is forgetting the single most important thing: good storytelling is king.
It doesn't matter if you bring in big names if you're not telling an awesome story.
Checking all the boxes for political correctness is also something that's becoming such an annoyance that very few movies are actually managing it effectively, the rest just stumbles through the motions and gets crappy mandatory references and adjustments that really hurt the final product.

To start, the in your face Progressive PC messages were so obvious and thick, it took away the heart and magic that made Dumbo such a treasure. In doing so, it distracted the true star of the movie, Dumbo himself; where it should've been about him just like they did in the animated version.With the exception of the older seasoned actors, the two main children's acting didn't impress me one bit. Particularly the young girl with her wooden acting skills as well as the lack of her facial expressions which barely changed throughout the movie.The saving grace was watching young Dumbo and his mom Jumbo, rightfully returning home where they both belong, and not trapped in a circus act for the masses.",Dumbo

571,kjfkuipers,Rating will only get higher,8,11 November 2019,"This is my first review , but I felt like Dumbo deserved one. As I'm living in The Netherlands, I've had the privilege for 2 months to test Disney+. Last week Dumbo was added to the library and I watched it right away.I was curious to see if the movie was as bad as many reviews tell suggest. Those reviews and rating even made me skip this movie in the theaters and even as a rental. But as it came with the free Disney+ trial there was no reason not to watch it.To start with I'm not the biggest one, but I am a fan of Burton. And Dumbo fits seamlessly in his repertoir. I'm also not the biggest one, but I am a fan of Disney. And I was delighted to see the story following a different path than the original cartoon. Sure it's still Dumbo, but I couldn't predict the scenes and the ending, unlike in the live action remakes of Aladdin, Jungle Book or the hightly rated Lion King, which was a big plus for me. People complaining about the story not being faithfull to the original cartoon should watch the cartoon instead.I liked the story and characters, however Devito might just be getting a bit too old and tired for the role he played. SFX were heavy, but not too much or distracting and they looked great. Overall the movie had a great atmosphere.In the end I never got bored watching the movie, which is a good sign, if not the best sign. As there should be many more people like me who skipped Dumbo because of the critism, I expect the rating to rise as soon as Disney+ is released worldwide after tomorrow and people will start watching Dumbo and leave their reviews.",Dumbo

580,stevevel,Incredibly Boring and Unnecessary,1,5 August 2019,"I don't consider the 1941 ""Dumbo"" movie to be one of the greatest Disney animated movies, but to me, it still was a pretty interesting movie, home to very iconic scenes, from the ""Baby Mine"" scene to the Pink Elephants dream sequence. With the remake however, not only does it not add anything new or interesting to the original movie, but instead, it ends up creating unnecessary changes that just make the movie very shallow and soulless.Here, emphasis is put on the human characters, and outside of Danny DeVito's good performance, none of them were compelling. They were all incredibly clichéd and dull, once you've seen them, you already know their motives and how all of them are going to end up. Speaking of which, the child actors (Nico Parker & Finley Hobbins) here, were some of the worst I've ever seen. They looked as if they were always bored out of their mind, did they even go through an audition process to be cast in this movie? They conveyed no emotion whatsoever, and anytime they were on screen, I really wished that it would just move on to the next scene, hopefully without them.The direction also felt really safe and lifeless. When once Tim Burton was hailed as being one of the most creative and eccentric directors, now he just always ends up directing really stale and forgettable movies. He managed to take the aforementioned scenes and butcher them, seemingly forgetting what made such scenes interesting, surreal and heartbreaking in the first place.The CGI and effects also were stale, and I do not see this film ageing well at all, like with all the rest of the remakes that Disney is just churning out left and right. Even the original movie by comparison, will outlive this one, cause at least it had really memorable moments, as well as great music. Speaking of which, unlike with the original, where the music was great and stuck with you, the remake offers none of that, replacing it with music that sounds like stock music and again, completely ruining the beauty of ""Baby Mine"" and why it worked in the original movie.Overall, it was a really useless movie for me. It did not add anything new to the original, and the changes that were made, made the movie worse and turned a simple story that had a brief runtime, to an overlong mess. One of the most monotonous and mundane movies I've ever seen, and one that I will probably forget in a few hours.",Dumbo

I cried ten times at least. It's so tragic and dark and guilt ridden, just like the real Dumbo.
The allusions to social nuances of my generation are mind-blowing. I feel like Tim Burton somehow pulled old memories of my vacations to Disney World and from them validated every essence of my white suburban upbringing. The reference to dreamland and the Epcot sphere, the feathers, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Wonders of Science . I couldn't handle at lot of it. Only tears.

593,thorsprincess,Terrific Makeover of My Least Favorite Disney Story,9,17 April 2019,"The story of the cruel treatment of a misfit baby elephant and its protective mother was always problematic for me. The circus was a cruel place and even a Disney ending left the circus essentially unchanged, except for Dumbo and his mom. Acceptance for the inherent circus treatment of animals always made me uncomfortable. The circus audience's weird fascination for freaks and dangerous sensations was troubling. While the new Dumbo isn't groundbreaking cinematic work, the story has been improved. The demise of the big top and collateral damage in the first 10 minutes felt like revenge for the early Disney animated tale. The children were engaging. The father was an interesting figure, played by an excellent actor. The supporting actors added depth and interest to the story. The villains were detestable and the the spectacle was amazing. This film was fun to watch, with a satisfying and respectful ending for modern audiences. I watched it with my granddaughter, aged 10, and we both enjoyed it.",Dumbo

But here's why: this one isn't a frame-by-frame of the cartoons that we saw as kids! It had more depth and more characters, and the side characters were well-written.

603,jake2525,A movie made for dumbos,2,31 March 2019,"Another crass remake made by Tim Burton, Dumbo fails to deliver hardly anything good to write home about (aside from Danny Devito's performance). It follows the trope-heavy screenplay of ""the kids are always right, adults are wrong"" that just makes you want to sigh constantly. The ""bad"" guys are obvious from the very moment they are introduced and don't actually get revealed as bad until further in the movie, which normally wouldn't be bad in a Disney movie since they are meant to be carried by the musicals and animation, however this doesn't work for Dumbo at all since there are no musical numbers and the villains are revealed in a painstakingly obvious way.
Since this is an adaptation of the 1941 film by Walt, it's fair to draw comparisons despite being very different films. First off is time. Dumbo 1941 was able to tell a very simple story about an elephant that finds out it can fly in an hour and four minutes, and much of this time was taken up by the musical numbers. Those musical numbers are what made the film a classic, not the story. The actual story of Dumbo is simple, it doesn't meander on the fact that the elephant can fly and keep writing story after the elephant flies because it risks losing the wonder and amazement of the spectacle. Dumbo 2019 however takes the approach of introducing the flying elephant very early in the film and follows a poorly written trope-heavy screenplay about the utilization and conflict over the flying elephant. The biggest offenders for myself were Burton's rendition of Pink Elephants, which is only a minor callback in this film and lacks nearly all the iconic elements which made ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" a cinematic spectacle with the original Dumbo. ""Baby Mine"" had a fairly good rendition, not great, but it was one of the better parts. Also included was a reference to the Crows' song, however it was only a joking reference which is like pouring salt on the wounds of a person like myself who wanted to see well done renditions of the classic film. The film is also very dark, with generally hazy skies and dark lighting, the average Tim Burton style. It fits the screenplay but as a whole I despised that stylistic choice with a Disney movie about a flying elephant.
Aside from watching Danny Devito sing Casey Jr. this movie is a skip. I nearly walked out of the theater after Pink Elephants crushed my spirits but hoped for a good musical rendition after the credits rolled (adding onto my disappointment as there was none). Just go watch the original Dumbo, save an extra 50 minutes wasted on a meandering screenplay, and forget that Tim Burton ruined another remake.",Dumbo

605,dumbmovieman,"An attempt, but not a memorable one",4,1 April 2019,"Showing no signs of stopping, Disney has released their first of three live action remakes with Dumbo. To be fair, the story of the elephant Dumbo is quite good. The CGI used on him could have been a nightmare, but thankfully Burton's visual eye does not disappoint giving us a very cute elephant that even little kids will love. Even whenever Dumbo would fly it is spectacular. Leave it to say that Burton brings his A game when it comes to his visuals and he does not disappoint on the actual story of Dumbo. Too bad that all occurs in the first 30 - 45 minutes. The other hour of it is a snooze to say the least. While there is an attempt from Burton to tell a story that has weight and value, you end up not caring about any of them because the characters are either wooden, clichés, or cartoons. You end up not caring about any of them and it all goes back to the fact that Burton is not a good storyteller. Then something happens in the movie, and it takes such a left turn that it is jarring to say the least. While they do give nods to the original movie, the problem is that the nods he gives are actually integral story moments, that Burton shrugs off in favor of other things that just don't matter.Dumbo himself is great in this movie, other than that, you have a movie that you will most likely forget about after a couple days.

This retake of the classic creates an original story which, in my opinion, surpasses the original. The retelling if Aladdin and The Lion King were a travesty to the art which Disney had created, and offered little of the creative spark- People were payed to create an inferior rip offs of the originals. Dumbo, however, is a breathe of fresh air, and I hope Disney will stop trying to use their copyrighted characters to make money.

611,robertdern-13121,Not as Terrible as I Feared,6,1 April 2019,"First, I am a big big fan of the original. I read six reviews on this new 2019 version, and have yet to find a single critic who seems to fully grasp the artistic genius of the original. Sure, there are some cultural aspects that have not aged well but that is a separate topic. I find the original Dumbo to be a monumental work of visual story telling. I appreciate Burton's efforts to tip his hat to some of those elements. I also appreciate the good natured efforts to expand upon the (what should be obvious) themes about NOT treating animals cruely. Eric and Trump Jr. should, for example, watch this movie, regardless of how mediocre it may be. Right. Themes. I also found it to be a cool idea to expand the story to examine the evils related to our current state of captilalism where the Amazons and Googles swallow up all the mom and pops,etc. But the script is laughably shallow on character and exhaustingly bloated on 'plot'. Having made so many great films, one would hope Burton would know better, but his past half dozen efforts have of course proven otherwise. Burton, fire your development team and hire better writers. Then and only then will you have the potential to kindle the type of cinematic magic you once conjured in days of yore.",Dumbo

I never quite worked out which audience this was aimed at and found it really quite laughable - particularly seeing Eva Green RIDING the flying Dumbo.
Don't even get me started on the acting - this has some big names attached to it yet I saw no sign of any experience. Michael Keaton was utterly ridiculous and just plain awful.
No character development of any of the other 'circus folk' yet we were supposed to feel something when they banded together to save Mrs Jumbo.

614,nfweidner,Shockingly bad ((SPOILERS)),2,30 March 2019,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSOk. I went to see this with a group of friends the other day and all I have to say is wow. The amount of CGI in this movie is egregious - sometimes I think I saw people that were CG or maybe I was just used to the overwhelming amount of bad CG in this movie. The monkey was CG, yet many films in the past utilize a real monkey actor. It was especially bad when Dumbo is ridden and at the end when the dad character gets a robotic hand. By the way, lets talk about that. What?! A world war 2 veteran, just a few years after the war, receives an incredibly advanced prosthetic limb? Invented by his preteen daughter? What?! I was just so confused by moments like these.
Unfortunately, this movie had a lot of consistency errors and plot holes. Here is a list of what I can come up with on the top of my head:
One moment the dad is riding a white horse, but then it becomes black? Maybe I was zoning out from how bad this movie was, but I am pretty sure they just switched horses.
A grown many continuously chases little children, asking them where the elephants are. I do not think a real person would go after KIDS because he thinks these LITTLE CHILDREN are the masterminds behind the scheme. I know its a Disney movie and it doesnt have to be super accurate but it still was weird.
This is a minor detail, but it made me very angry. In the beginning, I believe it was established that Dumbo was an Indian Elephant. However, when they get to India, they overlook a valley full of elephants bearing tusks. Indian elephants do not grow tusks! Did the family send the elephants to Africa by mistake? I just dont know.
Plot hole: how did they get the elephants onto the ship? They didnt even pretend to act like they were meant to be boarding. Not even a cage! There were many rock workers in the area, and they just allowed a group of strangers to put two elephants on their boat!
When trying to free dumbo, the father climbs the top of the Colosseum by hoisting himself (pretty easily) up the metal supports. With one arm. On a curved, metal surface. Also, when he falls down the dome but catches the metal beam at the last second, he would certainly dislocated or broken his arm from the amount of force put on it.I dont want to delve into this part very much, because acting is very hard - especially for younger actors. However, the child acting left something to be desired. The dialogue was clunky and reminded me of the awkwardness presented by Wednesday Addams from the Addams family (the awkwardness was intentional, and the child actor in thst did a good job in that movie imo)While I am giving this movie a lot of hate, I do have one positive thing to say about it. That one thing is a man named Danny DeVito. Most of his jokes landed very well and I even laughed out loud a little bit when he said that the monkey was in his desk in case of an emergency. I feel like he played his part very well and everyone there said they enjoyed his performance. Also, hats off to the costume designers for incorporating the white grease-stained undershirt/tank top in the beginning. It was a simple yet elegant touch that really portrayed to the audience that this guy was a bit of a sleazy bum.Overall, should you take your kids to see this? If they want to I guess. Do not expect to enjoy it very much, especially if you want the same energy and vibe that the original Dumbo gave us. So sad to see a classic remade into this CGI intensive train wreck.",Dumbo

Unnecessary dialogue from the children actors pointing the obvious (""Dumbo is upset."" ""Dumbo is sad."") and poor character development leads the modern take on Dumbo to be a boring and plain children's film. The 2019 PC culture has obviously had an effect on this film with the two most iconic scenes from the original twisted and broken and an ending only to sigh at (reminds me of the ending of Grease) Unless you have a child age 3-5 and you, a parent, are tired and in need of a nap, Dumbo is the film to watch for you.",Dumbo

Brought to theaters by the iconic Tim Burton he leaves the audience in awe and amazement. Dumbo is Directed by Tim Burton and a production by Walt Disney Pictures and Tim Burton Productions. A genre of family, fantasy and adventure the world of the circus is brought to the audience. Where the audience can feel like they are sitting not just in a movie theater but at a live circus show and seeing behind the scenes. Coming from Disney's Dumbo from 1941, to the 2019 remake, you'll find a full range of persons of young children, to young adults, to middle aged adults. This movie is for everyone and anyone. One thing is for sure, it'll leave you feeling like a little kid all over again. Tim Burton brings to life Dumbo in a small struggling circus. A circus that is barely keeping a float. A circus owned by Max Medici (played by actor Danny Devito) who has a big eared baby elephant born into his circus. Although this baby is first seen to be as just an elephant that is of no use to him, it's shown he is much more than just his big ears. With a circus full of freak shows, Max keeps the baby elephant but rids of the mother elephant as she is too much of a danger when it comes to protecting her baby. With a bond so strong between mother and son Dumbo becomes especially useless as he becomes sad and depressed. Max instructs his former head circus star Holt (played by actor Colin Farrell) and his two children to take care of Dumbo. As they take care of Dumbo as a family, they discover something Max would really like to see. Something magical, something impossible, but as learned throughout the movie, nothing is impossible. Not just Max but all around the country and especially V.A. Vandevere. V.A. Vandevere (played by actor Michael Keaton) has his own circus. His own successful circus that people from all over come to see a sight to see. As the two circus directors merge their circus's together, it's seen that not everyone has the best intentions. As Dumbo and his friends slowly discover the truth and discover secrets behind the show, it is more than ever that their family must stick together. This is a movie of not just the wonders of magic but the bond of family. No matter how weird, no matter how crazy, there is something special in everyone and who they are on the inside is what matters. Family will take you a long way. Family is everything.",Dumbo

DeVito and perhaps a few extras in the crowd scenes delivered passable performances but the other performances and the story were horrible. Further, I am shocked that this made it past any Disney execs that care about Disney's past (a Walt Disney type was the villain and images of Disney logos were hinted at in set designs) and Disney's future (if this is what we can expect from Disney who would hope for more?). I've never had less confidence in my role as a Disney shareholder that when it dawned on me that this movie was beyond hope of redeeming itself. Now to make the math work I would add to that hypothetical essay, ""Bleh.""",Dumbo

You might run out of them for your drama in tights and capes. I do enjoy them tooBut you guys are not critics. Or maybe you truly are. I doubt the so called popular critics with fan bases do things purely on merit ( cue in eddie bravo ""look into it"")You're the mass sheep. Children like superhero movies. I like them too cause I grew up watching them. But don't let the mindless violence and unfunny gimmicks ruin your sense of good cinema.This wasn't the most path breaking movie. But this had heart and more so considering how much reined in it was to accommodate ( in effect at least if not intentional ) the simple nature of the story. It is endearing to me. I have seen many better movies , but, at present it is a breath of fresh air. Have to thank the bland overproduced movies in vogue for that.I would watch this movie ten times over than watch the ""powerful villain tries to take over world, hero opposes ""and such bland stuff. Cant they come up with some other story?I realise I spent more time hating than talking about this rather enjoyable movie. That's partly because I liked watching it and it has partly enhanced my life with a memorable piece of story. At the least it is a bit different and it has left no hangover of the nauseous variety.I haven't seen the original. But what's the point of comparing and deriding this one? Are you all that jaded ?!

Other than the familiar opening scene of Casey rolling down the track and the brief appearance of Mrs. Jumbo and of course the beloved Dumbo, this was a completely new movie to me. Tim Burton is an amazing creative but took this remake of Dumbo in a dark, depressing direction reminding me of the first Batman movie which also might I add starred Danny DeVito.

This movie became all about the surrounding characters rather then the hard struggles that Dumbo had to overcome in the original film. And where are all the amazing beats? When the stork delivers the baby? When the crows sing When I See An Elephant Fly? Not even remotely the same movie!!!

662,ladytawny,Bit of a Mixed Bag Really...,6,11 April 2019,"This should have been a story about elephants and animals and courage and friendship in the magical setting of traditional circus life aimed at children of an age who would WANT to see an elephant fly! Burton could have made use of the huge opportunity for a variety of circus acts and sideshow characters to pad out the movie with more human presence than the original - we didn't need greedy businessmen with sneaky contracts in a sinister steampunk Pleasure Island setting instead; nor was it necessary to focus more on the human characters than Dumbo himself! Personally, for a magical family film for little children, give me Chris Columbus over Burton any day. Children under 10 don't need steampunk or the grotesque, they want brilliant fantasy and magic memories that they'll remember into adulthood. I give this film 6/10 (7 for the first half and 5 for the rest). Save for the deadpan wooden execution by the young girl, the casting and acting was great, the special effects were great and the elephants looked perfect. The star of the show really was Dumbo, a truly cute little creature that you immediately wanted to watch a story about; the mummy and baby relationship was heartwarming and emotional but sadly there was not enough of it! I wasn't a huge fan of the original as I had no time for the mouse character, the drunken hallucinations and the awful singing crows, so I was pleased that they didn't make it to the remake, (although we had a magical alternative with balloon elephants instead and the innocent joy on Dumbo's face was beautiful). This film COULD have hit the spot but it just didn't; the first 45 mins were promising but like many of Burton's remakes it lost its way in poor choice story changes. I have no problem with making things more PC, or popping in a solid moral or two, but where's the magic in this movie? It's neither fish nor fowl! Which age group is it aimed at? My clever 5yr old couldn't stay with it after Michael Keaton arrived (and I have to say that that IS when the movie went downhill) No fault of Keaton or Arkin, but the script was mediocre, all characters two-dimensional and the story changes were uninspiring - the whole thing was run of the mill. No Disney magic was evident in the last hour and opportunities for emotional involvement were wasted in favour of cliche action. Eva Green was beautiful, Farrell was unnecessarily dashing and even DeVito's heroic, ever-splendid presence was not enough to lift this bland and uninspiring offering I'm afraid. What a wasted opportunity!",Dumbo

670,travisfick1988,"The original had it flaws, but the remake had more",1,1 July 2019,"One of the things that made the original Dumbo magical was that the story was based around the magic of animals. We got to know a little elephant, who, with the help of a mouse, became something magical. That is Disney magic.The remake did not capture the same magic, partly because it was based around people instead of the animals. While Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito and the children were the best part of the movie, the story line made little sense.The beautiful songs that were in the first movie were not given the justice that they deserved and were often used as background and not as a way to convey feelings. The ""Baby Mine"" song originally was meant to convey the strong bond between a mother and her child. The remake used it as simply a transition between part of the movie.Disney did this with the remake of The Little Mermaid as well. I hope they don't continue this trend or the magic of Disney may be gone forever. I wanted to like this more, but it was missing the magic that the first Dumbo had.",Dumbo

This movie made me cry like 3 times and dumbo was just simply adorable without looking stupid. I'm glad they didn't do a mouse as dumbo trainer and storms to deliver yet this did a nice homage to them. Was weird to see Michael Keaton as the bad guy and Danny as the good guy for once. This movie has story, soul, realism with just enough magic. I've very picky for remakes of old movies I hold dear.

For being a Tim Burton (my favorite!) movie, it is probably his worst one. And it didn't stick to the story line at all, except that Dumbo flies. The story centered around Danny DeVito and Michael Keaton and oh by the way there's Dumbo and some French lady trying to fly on him 🙄 I think kids who have never seen the original will like it.

702,blonde_kittie,Good reimagining of the original but not perfect,7,5 September 2020,"I really like this remake. I do see why people may not like it as it isn't like the original.The film focuses more on the human characters and less on the animals. Dumbo's design is realistic yet cute. The movie pays homage to the original and follows some of original plot but it is not a shot for shot remake like Lion King with songs added.I think of it more a semi-sequel rather than an original reshoot.The acting is solid (admittedly the children are underdeveloped) with Danny De Vito, Eva Green and Colin Farrell as good. True Michael Keaton can seem cartoon-ish at times but he seems to be having alot of fun and that translates into his performance.I like the new changes that elevates the story to more full and rich rather than the original (an absolute classic but only an hour long with some questionable issues with race). I like the parts where they kept to the original but gave them a new twist.I would recommend to see it (especially with the kids on a rainy Sunday) but to keep an open mind. It looks beautiful, dark in places, with an overall charm that Tim Burton can only deliver. This feels Tim Burton-esque but not overly so.7 as it's not perfect, but better than I expected with other recent Disney remakes.",Dumbo
703,jiartigasc,They killed Dumbo,1,3 April 2019,"This is one of the worst ever Disney's cinema movies. Completely souless this is a forced progressive, naive, PC remake.
It does almost everything wrong, looks like Disney had a really innocent childish pc script and needed something to make it look a little darker, so why not just offer a ton of money to Burton? He does add a little darkness, but is so little that former Dumbo looks like a psychological thriller compared with this one.
I think it is fair to say this is the worst Burton's movie ever, the only good things are Eva Green and Dany De Vito's acting.
Do not waste your time nor your good child memories.",Dumbo
704,chadcolpitts,Haters Stop Flapping,7,5 July 2019,"This movie is not the disaster everyone would have you believe. It's a entertaining family film which is exactly what it set out to be.It's fun and charming if not a little scattered and obvious. The cast hams it up, but again it's a family film and that's to be expected.The best part is by far the visuals! Dumbo looks great, and very darn cute. When he flies it's stunning and catapults me back to my childhood. I also appreciated all the Easter eggs and nods (subtle and not so subtle) to the original film.Another thing I like is that it expands on the story of the original. One of the things I personally hope for in these live action remakes is more depth or new angles that couldn't be explored in a 90 minute animated musical. Movies are longer now and the storytellers should take advantage of that.If you're a fan of either the original movie or of Tim Burton, you should enjoy it. If not then just watch Operation Dumbo Drop instead.",Dumbo

706,benmanscoop,A rare find,2,30 November 2019,"As a lifelong Disney fan, I can honestly say this is the first time I've switched off before finishing a film. Depressing, boring and laughable all at once. 1 star for Devito and 1 for the admittedly great CGI.",Dumbo

708,miseasa,Incredible!!,10,30 March 2019,"I tend to be a little critical of the live action Disney remakes, but this was over the top amazing!! It held true to the story and was not dark like much of Tim Burton's work tends to be. It still had his use of color and shade to portray the dark aspects but it was SO much more than that!! The CGI was impressive and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dumbo!! He was so adorable! The R rating was mainly due to a death (no spoilers!!)but it was done in such a way that it was nor gruesome or disturbing. There were a few moments that could be scary for very young. Take you're family and enjoy this wonder!!",Dumbo

What it is, is a beautifully crafted film that looks stunning, and the version of Baby mine is glorious.",Dumbo
711,lisadrian3650,Jigsaw that didn't fit together,3,2 July 2019,"I watched the original Dumbo cartoon as a child, unfortunately this movie didn't make sense as a story, it didn't have the storyline fluency that you are used to from a Disney movie. Looks like an A.I. or something rendered the storyline with the scenes. I didn't connect with the characters and I really wanted to. I hope they learn from this movie and that the remake someday will do it justice.",Dumbo

713,pearsondavid007,Far too inoffensive,2,22 July 2019,"Takes away everything that made Disney charming in the name of political correctness. No ""drunk"" Dumbo moment in case it promotes alcoholism. No crows because they represent outdated views. It's overprotective and cgi subtracts from any relationship being built with the min character. A completely empty film.",Dumbo
714,ycapdevila,Why all the bad reviews?,8,21 April 2019,"I don't understand all the negativity towards the movie? I grew up watching the original Dumbo and I loved this version. Yes, it is different, but I do not think the alterations are at all offensive to the original. It's a different approach, but the core message of the story, which is denouncing animal abuse in circuses and the evolution of little Dumbo's courage and belief in himself remains intact. In my opinion Tim Burton has done a wonderful job, such attention to detail, the artistic and design part of the movie is fantastic and Dumbo is unbelievable cute and beautifully made. The only reason I give it a 8/10 and not higher is that I believe Colin Farell's character could have had a better accomplished - less basic script. I was crying from the first moment Dumbo appeared on screen till the very end. My partner who had never seen the original film, loved this version and was also very moved. Go watch it with an open heart and enjoy it, let yourself be moved!",Dumbo
715,sarahsvm,Boring,2,7 April 2019,"I agree, the story of dumbo is lost amidst the dull storyline of travelling circus vs corporation theme park. Wasn't magical or entertaining or feel good, was self indulgent on burton's behalf and should not of been classed as a remake. Dull boring and would not recommend",Dumbo
716,matt-ritchie-42034,I wish it was an Always Sunny episode,3,4 April 2019,The overcolouring of each frame could not balance out how dull this film was.

717,Rivergirl985,Beautiful retelling.. and such a gorgeous baby elephant!,10,29 March 2019,"Having just watched this wonderful movie and reading some of the critics' reviews... what exactly do the critics want?? This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie for all the family, and it was so refreshing to watch something a bit unique and different from the usual films that are released these days.
I don't understand how it can be criticised for the CGI animals not looking ""real enough"". Seriously? The critics really are nit-picking on any little thing they can, simply because it's Tim Burton and the critics don't seem to appreciate his way of making movies. Everything he did with Dumbo worked really well and the audience was loving it.Baby Dumbo is ADORABLE. So much emotion in his eyes, and very clever CGI work which really pulled you in to the story and the sadness of his character. He was so cute and his gorgeous little noises made me melt.Don't listen to the critics - go see it and enjoy it!!",Dumbo
718,gemmakent,No,1,20 August 2019,The original has been ruined. No one wanted a frame for frame remake but it has nothing to do with the original at all other than there is an elephant called Dumbo. And a death?? That's why Mrs Jumbo is deemed as mad?! I am fuming.,Dumbo
719,griffithte,The Cartoon for real,8,28 April 2019,"Sorry, folks. They had humans speak instead of a mouse.Otherwise it was pretty spot on to the cartoon, minus the drinking scene, and of course they added political commentary. Obnoxious as that may be, it's 2019 and we all saw it coming.Our 6 year old thought it was amazing. A lot of people are just being sticks in the mud.",Dumbo
720,barrow-36180,I guess Tim Burton can ruin anything,6,18 August 2019,"Would have been brilliant if it wasn't for all the Tim Burton. His dark cartoonish freakiness just goes too far this time and overshadows a wonderful story, excellent writing, and phenomenal cast.",Dumbo
721,link-29160,Another vapid cash grab,2,3 April 2019,"If this movie could be described geometrically, it would be a straight line. There are no highs, there are no lows, only scenes attempting to manipulate your feelings without much coherent sense. There are so many things I could say about this movie, but I think it's apparent what Disney uses that overblown budget for and doesn't even worry about the strength or coherency of the script.This is a flying elephant movie that is 95% talking and 5% flying elephant. What kid wants to see that?",Dumbo
722,xpectaculr,Not bad,7,20 December 2020,"I don't know why people are rating this a 1. I never trust any ratings below a 4. Those are the people who probably never saw the movie. I've seen horrible B movies and this is nowhere near that. Some people wants a scene by scene remake of the original. It doesn't work. Just look at The Lion King. They tried to do a carbon copy of the original and it just wasn't as good. At least with this movie, they added something new.",Dumbo
723,alexornelas,What are the bad reviews about ?,9,5 April 2019,"I was in tears within the first 10 seconds of the movie. I have a soft spot for Dumbo and Casey Jr is my jam. Danny Devito is a national treasure and can do no wrong. Michael Keaton's character was a delight. Colin Farrell's character could have been better developed , but the kids were his saving grace. I loved the story and the whole world Tim burton creates on the screen. You can see the painstaking detail he puts in every part of the film. The costumes were SUPERB!!! I would have appreciated a bit more back story for the circus folks but all in all Dumbo was the cutest !!! I really think it's a great message against terrible animal cruelty which the original showed as well. The pink elephant scene was imaginative. It is a beautiful film to watch, can't wait to add this to my collection. Please go in with and open mind and heart and let go of unfair expectations. Tim is an artist and artists evolve. This is a collaboration of strange, unusual, and creative minds that wish to share their visions with the world.",Dumbo

I was expecting to experience much more nostalgia than the one I did; Disney promissed that. The essence of the story is still there: Your biggest defect can be your greatest talent; Dumbo is still adorable but he unrevels in a loose atmosphere.What it does accomplish, is the great Disney production under Tim Burton´s direction; perhaps they create an incredible wrap and left aside the soul of the story.
Must watch it? Yes, try to avoid comparison. If you have not seen anything about Dumbo, you will enjoy this cute adventure.",Dumbo

Same goes to how some humans who actually have the heart to realize animals are precious. And if we don't cherish them, there will be no more. I also admire the film makers for dumbo, as they try to create awareness on no animal captivity acts should be carried for our future as it will harm the animals due to the greed and selfish attitude of humans.",Dumbo

736,beebee_cta,Not that bad,7,14 August 2019,"It may be the fact that I have a soft spot for elephants, but this is definitely an interesting take on the Disney classic. I liked that it's different from the original and I don't really get people when it comes to remakes. Especially Disney ones. If Hollywood does a shot by shot remake, then it's an unnecessary stupid copy. If they decide to do something different, then it's not good enough because it's not the same as the original.
Overall, I believe it's a touching film, beautifully shot, with decent performances. Sure, it's not Tim Burton's best movie or Disney's best remake and it will probably be forgotten in a few years, but I don't think it deserves all the hate.
Anyway, what do I know? Like I said, I see elephants and I just melt. So maybe this movie is more of a good fit for elephant and animal lovers than for the classic Dumbo film fans.",Dumbo

This was fantastic, from adorable Dumbo that makes you want to save him, to gorgeous Eva Green who's a screen gem herself, there wasn't a moment I didn't enjoy. Loved seeing her as almost ethereal in her grace and kindness compared to her other roles. And when you care about the stories of the troupe something's done right.

But Dumbo completely rewrites the original story and takes the focus away from Dumbo. You could even remove Dumbo from the movie and present it as such and it would be better than what they did.It's a shame that this movie is not that good because I actually enjoyed looking at Dumbo and Devito and Keaton do their roles pretty well but besides that this is a boring movie from Tim Burton.",Dumbo
