0,movieman_kev,laughing at fools,8,28 June 2005,"Less of a real movie, then merely a slice-of(Drugie) life about Ross (Jason Schwartzman) going about his life, weaving in and out of situations with his dealer (John Leguizamo), his girlfriend (Mena Suvari), the maker of his speed (Mickey Rourke, a phenomenal actor), and his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy). They all revolve around Ross because he has the car. Ross treats his girlfriend (the incredibly HOT Chloe Hunter) because he's a druggie fool. These people are all pond scum, freaks, and are all pathetic wastes of space. Fortunatly they all are hilarious to laugh at. No matter how screwed up your life is, there's always fools worse off. So grab a seat, open up a six pack or smoke up whatever, and laugh your F'n ass off. Plus you get to see Rob Halford, Deborah Harry, Ron Jeremy, and Billy Corgan in bit parts. And that, my friends, rocks.My Grade: B Unrated Columbia Tri-star DVD Extras: Commentary with director Jonas Akerlund and producer Creighton Vero; Second Commentary with producer Timothy Wayne Petternel and writer Will De Los Santos; 5 Deleted Scenes (with more nudity from Chloe Hunter); Music video; Poster and Photo Galleries; TV Spot; Faux Cookin Show and Theatrical Trailers; and Trailers for ""Auto Focus"" and ""Levity"" Eye Candy:Chloe Hunter shows EVERYthing; a few extras get topless",Spun
1,jadavix,A stylistic exercise,6,29 August 2017,"I never felt particularly engaged with ""Spun"", for some reason. I guess it's a typical cult movie: either you love it or you hate it. The rapid-fire, kinetic editing, aggressively bad, retro-style and generically crazy behaviour of the characters just grew tiresome after a while. The movie feels like ""Gummo"" made by a music video director. It's superficially ""shocking"" and ""in your face"", but there's nothing in the movie to really make you think. So that's what the experience of watching the movie becomes: like a long music video, ie. something which isn't supposed to be really engaged with or deconstructed... but at feature film length, it becomes exhausting. It never really held my attention for long.It's also impossible to take it seriously as a portrayal of something as real as meth addiction.",Spun
2,Polaris_DiB,"Trippy, silly, a hoot",6,16 April 2007,"There's a world of drug-trip movies out there, and the best thing about them is that most of them get away with an antidrug message after taking its audience through its psychedelic ride. This movie could also make some claims, but it's not so interested in that part. It's pretty much just the trip, involving colorful (some would say, ahem, ""Tarantino-esque"") characters and three days of meth binging.Which, by all means, makes it entertaining, even if the only characters worth half a hoot are the ones played by Jason Schwartzman and Mickey Rourke. The movie starts off with everyone just about ready to freak out and doesn't let down much afterwards, pretty much keeping pace and interest for its full runtime. Considering how easy it would be to slow down, and keeping in mind that the potential fanbase is probably just going to watch the movie when on drugs themselves, it's admirable that they maintained that kind of work ethic.Though, really, most of its all ""just a bunch of hooey."" (Pardon the silly expression). Rourke's monologue in the porn shop seems custom made to fit into some trivia book about the most instances of the word ""pussy"" in a three minute running segment. Brittney Murphy's screen time seems only to work because she's pretty and the filmmakers want her to be the ditzy pretty druggy for their audience. And the gay men at the root of the operation don't really seem to have much reason to be there except to include gay men somewhere in there (why not, right?).So yeah, it's fun, and I guess you'll feel a bit ""spun"" while watching it. It's kind of like the drug-trip style equivalent to the dumb-teenager comedy genre, which means it's almost custom made for any aspiring meth-addicts DVD player.--PolarisDiB",Spun
3,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Phenomenal piece of gut wrenching drug cinema,10,2 August 2015,"Jonas Ackerlund's SPUN leaves you feeling dirty, breathless, scuzzy, and like you've just watched a parade of every single facet of Chrystal meth addiction unfold in front of you like a horrible carnival of lost souls and ruined lives. It's a hard flick to sit through, but there's a brutal poetry and gutter stained beauty to the characters lives, and the events that unfold are a nonsensical, dizzying merry go around of calamity, confusion and speed addled insanity. It's my personal favourite film of about drug addiction ever made. Jason Schwartzman plays Ross, whose mission in life is to score the next hit. After a delirious opening sequence set to a calming rendition of Number Of The Beast, he arrives at the home of Spider Mike. John Leguizamo has never had a shortage of energy, and here he lets the ripcord fly off the handle, handling his role like a squirrel stuck in a vat of distiller caffeine, bouncing off every wall in sight and chewing the scenery like a plastic straw. Mena Suvari plays his equally addicted girlfriend Cookie. Brittney Murphy bring surprising depth to her role as a girl who Ross strikes a friendship with. The two of them eventually find their way to the house of The Cook, played by Mickey Rourke. From there the film heads down a scum encrusted rabbit hole of nonsensical run ins, hapless failures and an eventual rock bottom inevitability where every character finds themselves at a place where if they go any further with their lifestyle, there's no return. Rourke finds the emotional anchor in an otherwise manic roster, and even though he's off the wall for much of the film, he has a monologue in the eleventh hour that grounds his role in tragic regret. Very underrated performance from him. Murphy balances the ditsy slut aspects with a maternal yearning for something better than the road she went down. There's a whole rats nest of other assorted characters and cameos running around, from Peter Stormare's aggressive, hilarious narc, to Patrick Fugit's grotesque Frisbee, to Debbie Harry is from Blondie fame as a nosy feminazi. Even Eric Roberts shows up for a brief reunion with Rourke. The film has a heavily stylized, go for broke attitude that pushes the boundaries of what movies have been able to do, in the best way possible. It shows you not from an outsiders perspective what it might be like to observe people on this drug, but gives you a very intimate, non judgmental day in the lives of these manic, lost soul pixies, ghosts of their former selves, enslaved in the mania and constant need for a fix that is their own design. If you can handle this sort of stuff and like the sub genre (Trainspotting, Requiem For A Dream, The Salton Sea etc) then this is a heavy hitting visual and auditory blast of pure experimental cinema, and a total joy to watch. Just bring a barf bag.",Spun
4,rbverhoef,"Familiar images, but pretty entertaining",6,28 March 2004,"'Spun' is a movie that steals from other movies, 'Requiem for a Dream' mostly, but manages to stay entertaining and interesting the entire time. It is about drug addict Ross (Jason Schwartzman). He gets his drugs from Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), the place where he meets Nikki (Brittany Murphy). She is the girlfriend of The Cook (Mickey Rourke) who makes the goods for Spider Mike. Because of Nikki Ross becomes The Cook's driver for a couple of days days. Of course there is also police that can give some trouble. Basically this is the story. There are some subplots where we see how Ross tries to contact his girlfriend, probably former girlfriend, and how he has sex with a stripper, ties her up to his bed and totally forgets about her.The story is there, I guess, to entertain us with strange characters and a nice visual style, especially for those who have not seen 'Requiem for a Dream'. The way the addiction is and especially reaction to the drugs is shown comes straight from that movie. There are animation sequences, not from 'Requiem', that look pretty good. The strange characters I was referring to are played by Leguizamo and Rourke. Their characters are weird, one full of energy and another is Mr. Cool himself. Strange cool, but cool.Where 'Requiem for a Dream' is an anti-drugs movie in the best way, without a single happy moment, 'Spun' in the first place is a comedy. We have some good laughs because of the characters and their actions. The problem is that nothing has really happened in the end although Murphy's character has made an important decision. It seems that certain sequences are there because they could be funny. One sequence, and I admit it is funny, shows two Latina girls protected by The Cook. The way it plays is great but the reason we see it is the reason I described above. A similar sequence returns, again useless in this movie but again funny. It is probably one of the reason you will be entertained, I know I was, but also the reason it is just an average movie.",Spun
5,Karl Self,Function shouldn't follow form,5,22 February 2013,"Visuals and cast: 10/10 though.This movie is an unmitigated Hollywood rip-off of Guy Ritchie's first two movies ""Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". Only not anywhere near as good and engaging. A speed freak finds himself working as a chauffeur for a methamphetamine ""cook"", and mayhem ensues. The cast is outstanding, but gets in the way of the movie, because I kept thinking ""Wow, Mickey Rourke's back"" or ""Wow, Billy Corgan did the music"" which took me out of the movie. The director comes from music videos and it shows. The movie is like one long music video, glitzy but the story is lacking. A shame, really.",Spun
6,rainking_es,Requiemforadream wannabe,5,17 April 2005,"""Spun"" aims for being as anphetaminic as ""Requiem For A Dream"", but it does not disturb us in the same way that Aranofsky's picture did; if anything it gets on your nerves with its wild camera movements, , its ultra-fast zoom, and all those flashes. The movie aims too for being as stark and tough as those stories about the American misery that Harmony Korine uses to write; but once again it fails: the characters are way too ridiculous, and they are not credible at all. After watching ""Spun"" I knew that Jonas Ackerlund (the director) was a popular music video director, and let me tell you: it was no surprise!!.The fact is that even with that weak story and that poor script, Ackerlund gathered together such an strange cast with some pseudo-Hollywood-stars (Brittany Murphy, Mena Suvari, John Leguizamo), some perfect strangers at least here in Spain (the starring guy, for example), some outsiders of the industry (Debbie Harry Mickey Rourke), and a huge bunch of celebrity guests from porno and rock and roll territories (it is pretty funny, for those who like hard rock, to see Rob Halford playing an homosexual sex-shop assistant!). ""Spun"" completes itself with some hackneyed animations (as a psychedelic metaphora of the drugs action), and with a (cheers!!!) pretty nice soundtrack played by Marc Bolan, Mötley Crüe, Billy Corgan, or Ozzy Osbourne. Anyway, as we say here in Spain: we've played a lot of worst matches!.My rate: 5/10",Spun
7,itamarscomix,Spun,6,16 January 2012,"I'm pretty happy to admit that I probably didn't get the most out of Spun. Reading through reviews and IMDb message boards I've found people praising it over and over again for being the most realistic presentation of meth-addicts' life-style ever put on film. That's quite possibly the case; never having taken meth I have no idea. Indeed, it seems that every glaring review comes from someone who has a history with the drug, so I assume the portrayal is accurate. As it is, I can only review Spun based on what I got out of it - which is an interesting film, but definitely not a masterpiece.By itself, Spun has its merits. It's an atmospheric piece, with excellent cinematography and editing; Although it relies too heavily on editing tricks, and almost everything it does was done before in similar ways in more memorable drug-films like Requiem for a Dream, Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas and Dazed & Confused. It managed to bring in an impressive collection of actors, both for the leads and for cameos - Jason Schwartzman, Patrick Fugit, Mena Suvari, John Leguizamo and Peter Stormare in one film are a indie-loving hipster's wet dream - and they all do an excellent job, but their characters aren't very interesting. The film manages to convey the idea that methheads are real people with real emotions, but it hammers that idea into the viewer's head over and over again without saying much else.To explain - what Spun lacks, for me, isn't plot per se. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas or Trainspotting didn't have much of a plot either. But Spun has no depth or heart either. It puts the viewer into the meth experience, it shocks and unnerves - as it should - but it's not enough to make us care. The regular explanation that it's a film for methheads that only methheads will enjoy may have truth to it, but if so its value as a film is questionable. If it's meant to convey an anti-drug message, it's preaching to the choir - because only former meth addicts will know how realistic and thus how tragic it is, while to the rest of us it looks like a zany, trashy, sexy comedy that enjoys the drugs almost as often as it derides them.A six-star rating usually relates to a mediocre or forgettable movie - Spun is anything but. It's also not a bad movie. It's interesting and unusual, but it misses its mark for most of the audience, and it's not original or interesting enough to be worth watching simply as a visual piece. It's funny enough and has enough good acting - Mickey Rourke is of particular note, in the role that may have been the harbinger of his current comeback - but in the end it'll mostly leave you confused.",Spun
8,dave13-1,Get tweaked!,7,6 January 2012,"Jason Schwartzman plays an ordinary guy floating on the margins of the Crank Head culture, crossing paths with dealers, strippers, TV reality show cops (led by a mullet-sporting Peter Stormare), and other assorted fringe dwellers, all of them desperate, crazed and wrong in their own unique fashion. Jason drives for a wrestling addicted drug chemist (Mickey Rourke in a shambling, grunting, full bodied performance that pre-saged his work in the Wrestler) who is admired for his rough cowboy demeanor but who reveals himself over time to be a selfish exploiter. In between trips to convenient stores to buy drug making supplies, Jason slides in and out of an occasionally cartoonish (literally so, animation and all) twisted reality as he engages in the sort of drug seeking behavior that is the daily and even hourly existence of the drug user. This is not a serious look at drug use and its consequences, however, but rather a trippy slice-of-lowlife wander through the motels, strip bars, trailer parks and porn shops where the bottom feeders of the drug world live. One detail of their lives which is not overlooked by the camera is that 'tweakers' are so caught up the chase for their next high that they have perpetual ADHD, living lives of neglect surrounded by the debris of half-finished jobs and empty pizza boxes. Yuck. Look fast for rock heavyweights Debbie Harry (Blondie) as Jason's neighbor and Rob Halford (Judas Priest) as a porn shop manager. Amusing and memorable as a movie, but pay attention to the language advisory. The script is as foul-mouthed as anything since the Sopranos went off the air.",Spun

10,PeterMitchell-506-564364,This infectious flick will definitely spin you out,4,30 January 2013,"This not so potent movie will leave you spun. It involves speed, paranoia, drug making, crazed cops, even a green dog. We too have some cameos from some fine actors. All the actors impressed me in this, none more than the late Brittany Murphy. Jason Schwartzman too, who I really hadn't seen act before, pulled me in with his performance, of such intensity, he had me concerned for him. These two are so believable as drug addicts, they walk the fine line between acting and non acting. Spun has so many racey images, where in the end, nothing really amounts to anything, and whatever messages the movie was trying to telegraph got lost somewhere amidst this mess. Rourke is great as Murphy's old man who hires a motel room out, using it for a drug lab, hence the green dog. Oh, yeah, and guess what, husky voiced Rourke, (not the gentle voiced one we remember from earlier days) manages to blow up his motel room, before taking refuge in the back room of a sex shop. Got to lay off the speed Mick. When it comes selecting porn, Mick's a hard to please customer. Mick, an advocate of women's rights, shows us at first hand, his reaction to a guy hitting his two girlfriends, one guy never more deadlier with a six pack. Larry Drake, spending too little screen time as a vet, reminded me of just what a fine actor he is, while Eric Roberts is priceless as Mick's gay friend. ""Blondie's"" Deborah Harry, now overweight, makes a guest appearance as a tough dyke, another splendid acting performance in this insane film. Definitely an entertainer, you drug takers or non drug takers, will get a lot of laughs out of, if also relating with these drug's experiences and it's effects. But really, did we have to see Menu Suvari's poo hitting the water in the toilet bowl.",Spun
11,Antagonisten,Over-worked,3,15 January 2005,"I know that you should never expect too much from a music-video director since they almost never deliver. So it must have been the little Swede inside of me that wanted Swedish director Jonas Åkerlunds feature-film debut to be something good. Disappointment guaranteed.The junkie Ross (Jason Schwartzman) is used as driver by a drug-making cowboy played by Mickey Rourke. It's a three day journey without sleep, constantly twitchy with speed.This is nothing for people with epilepsy. There are literally thousands of cuts in this movie. And the words ""like watching a two hour music video"" have never been more true. And while it occasionally does look stylish and slick (the way i imagined Åkerlund wanted the whole movie to look) it still becomes more annoying than entertaining in the end. The whole speed-freak journey with everyone always high and the camera always twitching is simply not working. All the sex and explicit scenes also feel mostly like exploitation in the end since there is so little else going on.In the end this movie just feels over-worked. Åkerlund tries so hard to make it cool that it falls flat. In the end it doesn't matter how many nods to popular culture he adds, or how many slick shots he pulls off, when the result is a movie that lacks cohesion and entertainment value. I rate this 3/10.",Spun
12,futures-1,Feel better about your own life!,7,6 June 2005,"""Spun"" (2002): Starring Jason Schwartzman, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, John Leguizamo, Patrick Fugit, Mena Suvari, Chloe Hunter, Deborah Harry, Eric Roberts, etc.. My reactions are mixed. I'll try to keep it simple: First, I'm very glad to see artists trying different approaches to film making. Many of the techniques used in ""Spun"" are effective for illustrating the pathetic mental/emotional/drug states of crystal meth addicts. Schwartzman is good as the one-foot-in, one-foot-out addict, who, although the main character, is a satellite to the addicts who are in much deeper. Rourke is solid as the drug ""cook"" - cold, lost, unpredictable, with a self-styled version of ""war-torn honor""; Murphy is very good as the fragile, broken meth addict whose life is a total wreck yet she clings to a sad fantasy about improvement; Leguizamo is the paranoid dealer with an anger that flashes from nowhere for no real reason and keeps everyone tense; Fugit is the totally lost kid who hasn't a clue, never did, and never will; Suvari plays the burned out addict who's reached the nasty-scuzzy level where even another addict would rather jerk off than ""face"" her; and Roberts plays a Retro-flamo Elvis-Liberace character we should see more often for comic relief. It's quite a team. In a less ""stylish"", cruder way, ""Spun"" reminds me of ""Pulp Fiction"". Some of the techniques failed, or are unnecessary (the animation scenes), some are interesting but overused (fast editing, film speed changes, harsh color, sound effects), but the camera angles are consistently unique, as are the close ups of everyday things that keep the mood at a very basic, pointless, daily grind level. The scoring is appropriately kitschy, ironic, and moody. The dialog is better than many would give it credit for (but then, I think ""Gummo"" is underrated, too, so there's where I stand on THAT!). ""Spun"" is NOT a story. It is a mood. Does it have a moral tone? Sort of, yes: drugs don't work in your favor. Are we supposed to like or dislike these characters? Nah. They are who they are, and we ain't gonna change 'em. Are they the people you want as neighbors? Hell, no. Do we feel better about OUR lives after seeing theirs? Hell yes.",Spun
13,squeezebox,"Doesn't work at all, major waste of talent",4,29 March 2004,"If you have always fantasized about watching people get high on crystal meth repeatedly and loved Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" video, then SPUN is the movie for you, as it is little more than an endless series of scenes showing people shooting up, all filmed in the style of a frenetic music video.SPUN is as directionless and pointless as the characters it portrays. Maybe that is the point, but if it is, then there's still no point. If it's supposed to be a serious comment on drug addiction, it isn't. If it's supposed to be funny, it isn't. If it's supposed to be a head trip, it isn't.This is one of those movies that stands on the shoulders of far greater movies and fails miserably at trying to emulate them. It steals blatantly from REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, LOST HIGHWAY, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS and countless other movies dealing with drug addiction and/or altered perception. Other than good performances from an unusual cast who deserve much, much better, there's nothing here you have not already seen. And the ending is as underwhelming and predictable as your standard Julia Roberts movie. Still, I suppose it's worth a look on a rainy day, if only to see the movie's only genuinely surreal image, that of a scuzzed-up Mena Suvari struggling to take a dump.",Spun

15,chron,An Incomprehensible Mess of Nothing,2,27 May 2007,"I was expecting a gritty drama of life as a drug seeker. Unfortunately, the writers chose to interject campy comedy into the rather stoned script, so all notion of interest went away quickly. The direction and editing were second rate. One of Brittany Murphy's rants was so poorly edited, the point of the dialog was lost.There was some good acting by the primary cast of characters. John Leguizamo did an exceptional job as did Brittany Murphy. Mena Suvari also turned in a good performance. Much of the rest of the cast were B actors, turning in some awful performances. The two gals that portrayed the liquor store clerks must have really been clerks because they certainly weren't actors. Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts demonstrated their expected second rate skills.The story line also went into animated trip scenes that I felt were just pornographic. I am not prudish about such things, but it was not relevant to advancing the story or helping us understand the characters. Certainly, I don't need to see a turd drop. What was the point of that? In all this is a mess of a movie. It suffers from bad writing, horrible direction and a severe shortage of good acting.

The amount of art that went into this film is just awe inspiring. The editing and production that is done to portray the states of these meth addicts is very impressive to me as a videographer who does low level editing and production for my job. People should appreciate this movie more.First of all this is a cautionary tale that should steer people away from doing crystal meth, which I appreciate because it is the drug that is the worst for you. And they really depict what it does to your brain and how it makes you ""glitch out"" so to speak, and become ""spun"", which is where the title gets its name. The combination of editing together different quick takes, and even inserting some trippy cartoons is really cool. They really make you feel what its like to be in the mind of a meth head.There is also some very powerful storytelling and acting going on here. By the climax of the film you have really gotten to understand the mental illness of the characters. And there's a very profoundly moving scene where two of them are all strung out and talking to each other about their lives, their delusions, and how they want everything to become all better, but you know they are in a downward spiral and things are probably just going to get worse. It is quite emotional and brings a tear to my eye every time.Every aspect of film is done so well here, it really is a work of art. And if you appreciate the art of film you should really give it a watch. It is one of my favorite films. And it also has three of my favorite actors in it, doing one of their best performances: Micky Rourke, John Leguizamo, and the late great Brittany Murphy in my favorite performance of hers.

Spun takes us on a sick and sometimes amusing journey into the world of speed-freaks. We see the users, the cooks, the third party victims, etc. And even though we are entertained and amused in many parts, the movie never paints a pretty picture of the life, never. Adding to the greatness of this film is an incredible cast. Mickey Rourke makes his return as one of the icons of Hollywood. Even though all of the actors are great, you wait in anticipation for the scenes with Mickey. Now be advised, some of the stuff in this movie is disturbing and it can be upsetting.

20,sitenoise,"A credible job for a ""Requiem for a Dream"" clone",7,23 June 2008,"If it doesn't bother you when a director blatantly rips off another movie, take this one for a spin. It's Requiem for a Dream for the methamphetamine crowd. Not as good, of course, but it's a fun ride. Lots of quick edits, lots of Oliver Stone weird, sweaty, extreme close-ups, and absolutely no substance. It's just a week, or so, in the life of a bunch of speed freaks. Nothing more.BIlly Corgan contributes some good stuff, via Djali Zwan to the soundtrack and gets in a quick cameo. There are lots of cameos alongside the ensemble cast. Leguizamo's a little over the top, and Mira Sorvino, er ... Mena Suvari seemed a little stretched, but all in all not too bad. It's a fine line between over-acting and acting like you're freakin' on speed, so I'm not going to complain.Spun is also surprisingly explicit in a number of ways: Leguizamo's masturbation scene wearing nothing but a sock; the shot of a little turd splashing in the toilet while Sorvino takes a dump; a girl tied to a bed for pretty much the length of the movie, naked and spread eagle with gaffer's tape over her mouth and eyes forced to listen to a skipping CD the whole time.There is no moral to the story. Heck, there really isn't any story. It's just one big buzz with events. I don't mind that it's a Requiem for a Dream clone in style, not substance. I would imagine this kind of physical film making via power-edits would be difficult to do, and I think this first time director did a credible job.",Spun
21,FeverDog,"Round like a record, baby.",7,7 March 2003,"If you've ever wanted to see William Miller in a Larry Clark movie crossed with the hyper-reality of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, then look no further.  SPUN is an unrated trip through crystal addiction with a lot of strong performances by an eclectic cast, but it faintly reeks of ""been-there, done-that"" syndrome. Not that it's not entertaining as it goes along.  A few days in the lives of various speed freaks produces all sorts of sleaze: Masturbation, phone sex, zits, rotting teeth, bowel movements, naked obesity, bondage, squalor, trashy reality TV, animation, pornography, animated pornography, and so on.Max Fischer (Jason Schwarzbaum) is Ross, a casual addict who falls into the role of a chauffer of the local manufacturer, dubbed the Cook (Mickey Rourke, in the film's most realized performance), who's with Nikki (Brittany Murphy), who's overly concerned with the well-being of Taco, her green dog. Her best friend is Cookie (Mena Suvari), who's the girlfriend of the local drug distributor (John Leguizamo).  ALMOST FAMOUS' Patrick Fugit, looking like he'd be right at home in Gummo, is the naive punk wannabe who is forced by the cops to rat on his supplier.  On the fringes are Rob Halford, Debbie Harry, a fey Eric Roberts, and Dr. Giggles himself, Larry Drake.  Meanwhile, Ross has got a stripper chained bare-ass naked to his bed while he drives both the Cook and Nikki around town, taking care of the local kingpin's professional needs and her neuroses and penchant for snorting crystal.But this plot doesn't really matter.  SPUN seems more concerned to ape the visual ideas of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, like the dilated pupils and jumps in sound effects. It doesn't exactly imitate REQUIEM, but the similarity seems more than a coincidence. And I'll mention again the animation:  Think Ralph Bakshi's orgiastic imagination, and you'll begin to know just how gloriously perverted some of the whacked-out imagery is. SPUN is certainly not boring, but it goes on too long. There's only so many visual effects one can withstand before all the visual volume becomes noise.

I comes as no shock that the man who made this movie used to make music videos. Very short takes, lots of colors and odd angles. If it was up to me he would still be doing music videos. During the movie i just sat and glanced at the timer on my dvd player hoping it would skip some minutes so it would all be over. This movie didn't give me anything and really took time from my life. If it wasn't for Peter i would really really trash this movie, but because of him i rate this movie 4",Spun
24,scarletminded,Forced myself to watch it...,1,25 September 2004,"May be spoilers.I knew after 10 minutes, I wasn't going to like this film. It has all the ingredients I dislike in film. It doesn't have a plot. It is badly acted. It lifts from other films like The Doom Generation, John Waters films, Natural Born Killers, Requiem for a Dream and more. It relies on special cheesy effects to move it along. Its parodies, such of Cops and cop shows are old. Family Guy did a Cops parody that was the exact same thing as the one in the movie. South Park and the Beastie Boys did cops show parodies years ago when the idea was fresh, not sour and overdone. Spun doesn't have many good or original qualities and it tries very hard to be the little drug film that could, but falls flat.On top of this, the film has Brittany Murphy in it. Anytime I see a movie with Murphy as a main character, it is a major disappointment. I had to suffer through Cherry Falls, for example. I should learn my lesson with that movie. I didn't know what the point of the movie was other than the characters swearing at each other and taking drugs. That was it. There were some amusing scenes, like when Jason Schwartzman's character ties up a girl in bed and keeps taping her eyes and mouth closed and leaves a few times without untying her. I am unsure if this is supposed to be comedy or tragedy, but it kept my attention. Same with Debbie Harry's Biker Lesbian character. The rest of the time, I sorted through my LPs and wrote up a list of things to do, glancing here and there to see if I was missing anything. I wasn't. Of course, I have no idea what happens at the end. Something blew up and Schwartzman's character was sitting in the car, in a daze, the same daze he had been in during the whole film.It doesn't work. It doesn't work as a reality film, a fantasy film, a drug film, a comedy or a tragedy...it just takes up space and time. I am amazed at the amount of talented actors that signed on to this film, especially Schwartzman and Mena Suvari, who I have enjoyed in several other films. My question is why? Didn't they have something better to do? The soundtrack, despite the handiwork of Billy Corgan, left something to be desired too. Why didn't this film work? Did Suvari really desire to do a toilet scene? The film leaves me with tons of questions, but none about the plot line of the film, since there was none.Another irritating thing was the adding of blurs to anything overly sexual. I don't know if this was done for an artistic purpose or to avoid an X rating, but it would have benefited from not having the blurs in there. It was even on frontal nudity. It was very annoying. Imagine watching a movie that is really dull and then something overtly sexual happens and you can't even see it? ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Flatline.I should have turned it off after the first ten minutes. I knew where it was going. It was trying to be a funny arty indie film about drugs and it was gonna fail, but still I sat through it, forced myself to watch it because a few friends told me it was good. I will stick with my instincts from now on.",Spun
25,unakaczynski,"Direct ""Spun-off"" of ""Reqiuem for a Dream.""",6,23 January 2006,"Spun 2002 R/Unrated (Quickie Review pertains to Unrated version)For no apparent reason, the last few years, I've ended up seeing a lot of films revolving around drugs. I'm not sure why, I've never been interested in the sh*t. I play video games and watch horror movies. I don't have time for that sh*t. Plus, I don't have many friends to ""peer pressure"" me into any of that sh*t. Or, maybe, I just had somewhat higher quality friends. Or maybe I valued my brain and health more than most... Whatever the reason, I've ended up seeing a lot of this crap the past few years...Spun follows a few people around while they do tons and tons of, I think, meth. I'm pretty sure it's meth. Meth is the drug with the noxious ""make Chernobyl look like a picnic"" explosive chemical labs. And this movie has a lot of people doing meth. It also has a lot of familiar faces in it, including, Deborah Harry, Brittney Murphy, Mickey Rooney, Rob Halford (woo Judas Priest!), and John Leguizamo. The movie is made in a very stylized manner, sometimes obnoxiously, other times with a lot of humor stuffed into it. It follows the typical drug movie formula, albeit darker throughout-seeded with nasty people who waste their lives doing drugs, treating each other sh*ttily... and little else. Sure, we get to see Leguizamo jerk off into a sock, Halford (briefly) reading a gay porn magazine called, as I recall, ""Bathhouse Blowjob,"" and Mickey Rooney sit hovering over bubbling chemicals in a filthy motel room.The acting is generally pretty good and the music is as well. One would hope it would bethe film is directed by a man who once played drums for legendary Black/Viking/Thrash Metal band, Bathory. The ""drugs do you"" message comes through clearly enough, and their power over people is addressed fairly well. However, the film itself and the cinematography suffer in one major area: It's all inspired by, or ripped off directly from, the far superior, ""Requiem For a Dream."" Watch that before, or instead, of this film. Unfortunately, it'll likely inspire more kids to do drugs than to avoid them-as the film feels like it was made for an audience that's already inebriated most of the time. 6/10www.ResidentHazard.com",Spun

27,bergma15@msu.edu,That's gotta hurt.,8,18 April 2006,"Spun is all about methamphetamine addicts and their supplier (the Cook). The film is an incredible mix of humor and desperation showing addicts losing everything to get their fix. All of the characters are at the lowest rung of society whether they realize it or not, but somehow the movie finds humor in a place that most would describe as hell.Ross (Jason Schwartzman) is a meth addict whose girlfriend has left him. His connection, Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), keeps losing the supplies that he gets from the Cook (Mickey Rourke). Among Spider's usual gang of idiots includes his significant other, the annoying Cookie (Mena Suvari) and Frisbee (Patrick Fugit) who seem to just want to hang around and get high. On one visit, the Cook's girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy) recruits Ross to take care of the Cook's transportation needs (Ross seems to be the only one of them who owns a car). Frisbee gets busted by the cops and is set up as an informant to get Spider and hopefully someone further up the chain.The film is what I assume being on meth is like (I've never done it and have no urge to do it), it's fast paced at times, but seems to be intentionally slow at others. The director used quite a few clips of things that already happened, hallucinations and animation to show what is going on. Sometimes directors go overboard with these techniques, but here it really works. You feel like these things are happening in the characters' heads and that they're on a roller-coaster. What really makes this film work is the cast. This is definitely an ensemble. In addition to the actors I already mentioned; Deborah Harry plays Ross' lesbian neighbor, Rob Halford of Judas Priest plays the porn shop clerk, and Billy Corgan plays a doctor. Eric Roberts makes an appearance as the Man (the Cook's boss), and Pete Stormare and Alexis Arquette as a pair of cops who want to bust the meth ring.I really enjoyed this film, but it is a trip. After watching it, you feel strung out.",Spun
28,kneiss1,Where is the story?,3,20 September 2010,"I am a big fan of stories. It's probably the main reason for me to watch movies. This movie is a sequence of follies, it goes from one scene of a drug trip, to another. But there is no real plot. It's for people who find it funny to see humans freaking out on drugs. Usually those are kids that don't have much experience with drugs. Back in the days, me and my friends kept watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. We found it funny as hell. So I do understand the fun of drug movies. But unlike Spun, Fear and Loathing is a good movie, and has a good story. I seriously fail to understand the point of Spun. It doesn't even seem to be negative about drugs. All it seems to be, is one big drug trip. - Fun to watch for drug ""fans"", pointless for others.Actors have been good in this movie. It was pretty much the only thing worth watching. Sadly I didn't find the characters convincing. The few people on drugs that I learned to know, haven't been anything like them. Most characters are totally exaggerated. Which makes this movie not only pointless, but also totally unrealistic.(I just checked the IMDb rate-history. People below 18 rated this movie way higher than others. Suits my theory totally.)",Spun
29,Pingo-2,Destroyed by a Swede...,4,2 April 2004,"SPUN is written by Will De Los Santos and Creighton Vero who, according to IMDb, hadn't written anything before this film. It's a good first script, but it's no way near perfect. The dialogue is nice, the characters well developed, but the story is thin and never takes off.Jonas Åkerlund, the director and hack-editor, tried his best (I assume) with bombarding us with images, fast cuts and other boring things that a music-video-director seems compelled to do. However, it has no place here, and it does not work. It just becomes really annoying, lame and pretty corny. The film has a Swedish feel of it, and it's not good. The mood is more of a digitally illustrated fast-made cartoon, than a live-action feature film.The actors, especially Mickey Rourke (as The Cook) and Jason Schwartzman (as Ross) are really good, actually, but some performances are uneven and boring (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette as the two cops). It's pretty clear that Jonas Åkerlund is not cut out to making nothing but music videos. And quite frankly, the only thing he seems to be able to do is fast-paced and fast-cut film. Which is, after a few minutes, boring, predictible and totally unnecissary.If Jonas Åkerlund hadn't destroyed this script and some of the good performances, this movie could have got 7/10. Now, I gave it 4/10. If you're not REALLY into drugs and drug-movies, then you will be bored out of your mind after half an hour.Drugstore Cowboy (1989) and Pulp Fiction (1994) are two superior drug-films that you should pick up instead of this trash.",Spun
30,jmerlino,"Excellent, flawed, and unforgettable",7,23 July 2010,"Spun takes the viewer on a harrowing, hilarious ride-along with a bunch of speed freaks as they blast through a four-day binge. We meet normal guy Ross as he goes to score from his dealer, Spider Mike. At Spider's place, we meet his girlfriend Cookie, her friend Nikki, and teenage hanger-on, Frisbee. Spider has lost his stash and is freaking out. Nikki tells Ross that she can get him some speed, because her boyfriend is the cook.The cook agrees to provide Ross with speed if Ross will act as driver for him and Nikki (Ross being the only one with a functioning car). Ross goes off to meet his occasional hookup, stripper April. They go back to Ross's apartment (complete with eviction notice tacked to the door), and have loads of kinky sex. The cook calls. Nikki needs a ride. Ross leaves April tied to his bed (he'll be ""right back"") and proceeds to forget about her for a couple of days (Oops! Looks like Ross isn't so normal after all).Things go on in this vein. Frisbee is arrested and forced to rat on Spider. The cook blows up a hotel room. Ross hits rock bottom (but seems not to realize it) when his ""girlfriend"" (Amy, not his hookup, April) makes it very clear that she has no interest in him beyond the $400 he owes her.Along the way, people do drugs, talk incessantly, have sex and argue. what they do not do is eat or sleep.The movie's best point is its unflinching portrayal of the grubby lives of the characters. Mena Suvari, as Cookie, is a pale, pockmarked mess (contrast that with her radiance in American Beauty). Brittany Murphy, as Nikki, is sexy, but in a very low-rent kind of way. Jason Schwartzman's Ross is a convincing everyman, who becomes a twitchy, red-eyed burnout with scabby cuticles by the end. Formication is a bitch! The acting is great. These characters are not admirable people, and Schwartzman, Murphy, and especially Suvari have taken big risks in playing them.Unfortunately, the film does have some big flaws. Ross utters some embarrassingly amateurish lines like, ""...and the great thing is, I'm not hooked!"" We know it's meant to be ironic, but there's irony, and then there's irony that comes walking into the room with a sign around its neck saying, ""Hello, my name is Irony."" It's painfully obvious that this is a first script.In the end, though, this is a film that will stay with you. It's world is grubby, saturated and pornographic, but all to the purpose of getting to the core of the speed-ruined characters who inhabit it.",Spun

32,Rooster99,Excellent!,8,17 October 2003,"This film was great! Many people have compared it to Requiem for a Dream, however I preferred this movie. Requiem accurately depicted drug addiction and how low some people would sink for their next hit. It was a very depressing and powerful movie, not one I would ever want to watch again. You leave the theater feeling extremely drained. Spun is altogether different. The only thing they have in common is their central theme. Spun centers around Ross, the fairly normal speed freak as his addiction takes him farther and farther away from reality.Initially, I thought the characters were grossly overacted, however as the movie progressed, the opening sequences did not seem as far removed from Ross' world as I had originally thought. It was very interesting to see Ross' character move farther and farther away from reality. It was only a 3-day all-you-can-consume speed trip, however he started off as a normal guy with a drug problem and ended up on Mars, completely detached from reality. I also thought the cartoon sequences were very effective, they accurately demonstrated his impoverished state of mind while he was tripping. The audience got the impression he really was flying in his own world. It was interesting to see the lifestyles of the other people involved in the drug trade, most had been completely dehumanized by their dependence, living in squalor yet completely unaware of their surroundings.A great film! One that I can watch again for entertainment purposes only, but which also drives home the anti-drug message without being preachy. 8/10",Spun

A much lighter film than Requiem for a dream, though it did have a large amount of gratuitous nudity when compared to Requiem, but the drug use was a lot more mild. The cartoons gave it a weird Heavy Metal type feel. It really could have been a worse movie. None of the characters were too sympathetic. It was something that was entertaining, though not really that great. Very few people would actually like it, even with cameos by Debbie Harry or John Lequizamo or even Mickey Rourke as the lovable drug cooker.

37,KGitt44498,Spun into the gutter of filmmaking,2,12 August 2003,"The non-existent plot has been described elsewhere, so I won't recount it here.I watched the DVD because I like most of Brittany Murphy's characters and I liked Mena from American Beauty (only role of hers I've seen.)Brittany was about as expected, and I guess did the best acting in the movie. She had little material to work with, however. No one did.Unfortunately, seeing Mena dressed in sweats and fuzzy slippers, with grungy teeth and circles under her eyes was kinda non-romantic :-) I could have done without the image of her grunting on the toilet.Someone has to cook up the drugs, which explains Mickey Roarke as ""the Cook"". However, I really disliked his ""acting"" and rough growly voice, although in real life I suppose that would be caused by the chemical fumes. Neat to see he has false front teeth, probably a souvenir of his wrestling days. Thought his ""pussy speech"" at the porno shop was gratuitous, as was most of the movie in general.John Leguizamo - I knew the name, but not the face before this - must be applauded for his role, the low-light of which is when he frantically masturbates into a sock. Later, when arrested, that is still all he is wearing.The other characters? Forgettable.Some people will want to see the naked woman spread-eagled on the bed, or the X-rated animation of fisting, anal sex and golden showers - (not my cup of tea). Yeah, it's all there to see, but I suggest renting a porn movie instead as it will likely be more rewarding.The DVD has an uninspired commentary, but has a few items of note: 1) The movie supposedly has over 5,000 cuts, beating the record by about twice (so says the director) 2) The director was proud that although the original edit was over 3 hours, it lost nothing when getting trimmed to an hour and 41 minutes.

39,forecastmazy,You surely must go get 'Spun'....,9,7 August 2003,"Spun really is one of those amazing movies you tell your friends to go see. I read some of the comments and I see how people might think it's a Requiem rip off, but doesn't that say whenever somebody uses a camera technique that nobody else can EVER use that effect? No, it's really not a Reqiuem rip off, it's just another drug story. However there is something else here that's amazing...Actors and actresses that usually don't make good movies. Or at least have cinema sins in their past. Britney Murphy and Mena Suvari in particular have done movies that have really irritated me and several people I know, (Just Married for one and American Pie for another....) Being in this movie however has made me forgive them for their cinema sins and take them seriously as actresses. This movie truly is good and true to life. The movie just starts you out on this trip that really makes you feel like you've been thrown into the mind of a speed freak. The tweeking of the movie is similar to that in Reqiuem but not quite the same. Rather than using the effect to focus on the drug use this film uses it to enhance the film and give it the feel of a speed trip, then in particular scenes where the drug is used the effect is zoned in on. It does a good job of revealing the scary and grimy reality of a drug addict.I couldn't believe I hadn't scene this film when I saw it the other day. It's brutal, honest, shocking at times and yet very witty. Combining these elements is not easy for anyone and doing this role has once again added the mounting respect for John Leguizamo. Eight *s out of ten. Amazing movie! Definitely worth the watch. It just sucks you in and spits you right back out. But it's hard to really describe Spun, you have to experience it for yourself.

It is also filled with many slow and smooth songs in its soundtrack. There is something about this coupled yin and yang which translates beautifully into the best drug-centric movie I have ever seen. Several scenes, like the drive with Brittney Murphy and Jason Schwartzman, and the opening sequences where the music is so compelling I have replayed it just because it's so damn beautiful.

John Leguizamo and Mena Suvari are dead on in their portrayals of two dysfunctional people in a relationship mixed with sex, love and drugs (or more appropriately, love FOR drugs). Mickey Rourke's character conveys a menacing presence delivered through the actor's characteristic cool and laid back style. Of course Brittany Murphy's character is a continuous delight and pleasure to behold in every way. Even the police presence is entertaining. The whole package gives the feel of being right there.

(3)The movie derailed completely for me when Jason Schwarczman's (Sp?) character sadistically leaves the stripper tied to the bed and goes out on an endless string of misadventures.

45,Private Ryan-2,Spun is an overhyped mess,4,6 August 2003,"(Spoilers ahead)""Spun"" is a huge mess. While I was willing to give the movie some credit and suspend my disbelief from the get-go, the sloppy directorial work of Jonas Akerlund makes it just impossible. No wonder the movie feels as a bunch of MTV music videos put together. The narrative is lacking, and the empathy with any of the characters makes the experience even more tolerable. Also, I should point out that at times Akerlund plainly rips off effects and styles of  ""Requiem for a Dream"", but fails tremendously at putting them in context. They seem gratuitous and pointless. Half way through the flick, the tempo of the movie starts quickly decaying, and everything in it just feels tired, boring and repetitious. In the end, the movie just takes you nowhere.
The acting is fairly sub-par, with some honorable exceptions (Leguizamo and Rourke being the most believable of the bunch), and the long list of cameos is just surprising for a movie this bad. Mena Suvary should just simply sue her agent for getting her this terrible role. Also, I know these days every two-bit director feels the imperious need to gross out the audience and ""push the limits"" of taste, but did we really need to see Mena Suvary taking a dump in all luxury of details? I didn't think so.The best example of how bad this movie can get is in the two drug enforcement cops. There are circus clowns and street mimes out there that bring more substance to their characters than these two.There are interesting parts of the movie, and it certainly had the potential to be an interesting story, at the very least. Unfortunately it just feels like one expensive collection of music videos strung together by some intertwining stories that seem more incoherent and unbelievable as the movie progresses. As I said, there's a ""good"" movie hidden somewhere in there, under layers of pointless effects, bad acting, worst directing, and poorly strung together storylines. In total, I give ""Spun"" a 4/10.There are other movies out there that do a much better job at portraying this difficult topic: the aforementioned ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Drugstore Cowboy,"" ""My Own Private Idaho,"" or ""Trainspotting.""",Spun

47,ericjams,Meth is a tough drug to glorify,7,24 November 2007,"I simply want to discuss why I think this movie stands out among the genre of ""drug"" movies. Unlike heroin, LSD, marijuana, ecstasy, or coke, meth is a drug that simply can not be glorified. I love drugs and I love drug experiences. I mean I've grown past much of those scenes, but I appreciate drugs and often appreciate the ability directors have to depict drugs on the silver screen. Watching Spun makes me thankful that I never resorted to Meth, and I think its a brilliant rendition of what this drug does to you. As for the acting, I found the movie difficult to watch because the acting was so ""spun"" in a sense. The ADD that meth brings on is so clear in this movie. No thought is finished, no plan is thought out, cause and effect are muddled in a world of sped minds. Its not my favorite movie of this genre largely because I feel like drug abuse should at the very least bring a satisfying high to the user before sinking the user into the myriad of troubles that drug addiction brings. This is the one saving grace for the user, the momentary high. In Spun, the momentary highs don't bring much grace, but instead, bring added confusion, added torment, and added lows. Its not easy to watch, but its respectable nonetheless.",Spun
48,anchovyd,Awesome Realism + Damn Funny = Damn Good Movie,8,10 May 2012,"I started to watch this movie having no idea what it was about only that it had Mickey Rourke, who I am a fan of, and Brittney Murphy who my wife likes.All I can say is that this movie is awesome. Yeah there isn't much of a story, it's just a four-day window on the lives of these freaks. Not much going on here storywise just people driving around, hanging out and spinning their wheels doing nothing. The only real story element is the drug raid towards the end of the film.What makes this movie great is the acting, scenery and cinematography. After watching this film for a while you start to feel as if you're tweaking with the cast. Murphy and Rourke are great, I think that I just fell in love with Murphy after watching this. Also Leguizamo, who I normally can't stand (hated his one man show and the Mario Bros. movie) was incredible in here as Spider Mike. There is a lot of comedy here too that works.It starts off a little slow but once the police raid story line comes in the movies gets 10 times more interesting and I couldn't stop watching. My wife on the other hand bailed after about thirty minutes since the movie seemed to be going nowhere and she was disgusted with the grotesque condition of the flop house, near vomit inducing. I stuck with it because of the great cinematography and I was falling for Murphy.Bottom line: The movie takes a while to get going, but the cinematography, humor and accurate depiction of tweakers and flophouses keeps you on the hook until it gets interesting.",Spun

Be careful and not watch it with your family as i don't think your parents would like to see the guy with a sock in his penis, full naked, with a gun in his hand, coming from masturbating with the help of tele-sex service girl after getting dope. . If you like quick scenes with normally-not-necessary-details (you will see that some of the main characters are 'the doors' banging regularly and 'engines' in close range in every car scene) and full of edit films, you'll like this one for sure, you may even want to watch it more than once.. this film is said to have more than 5.000 edits, real fun if you like it (this film is nothing but a genius especially after watching 'elephant' of Gus Van Sant) i think the longest scene is when Ross makes the last phone call to Amy near bus station, up to 20 seconds non-stop...Also its great to watch Leguizamo (i first watched him in Carlito's way) with such a crazy role, don't even talk about The cook (M.Rourke).. . For me the only scene i got bored is when Ross is in the Car with Nikki,after she decides to leave The Cook, getting dope together with imaginative edits ,last some minutes.

I guess one could think of it like a chance to see what their world is like, these people who choose to let drugs totally take over their mind. Of course, there is ""addiction"" to ponder. But hey, having been over that bridge and back, I think it depends on the strength of will, of that person. The ending was pretty cool, funny. The movie is worthy because of the camera work trying to show what being in the midst of a craving for drugs is like, and really it just succeeds more then most ""drug movies"" at basically displaying the actual emotion and conversation that people such as these may have, and do. When I first saw this, I was about 10 years younger. Now, having been around the psychotropical block, so to speak, is it far more relevant to me. This being said, it does not stray into the realm of an 8 for me---- Yet. Another viewing somewhere down the road will let me figure that out.

Deliberately controversialist in that it shows the flipside of the American dream: motel-dwelling dropouts, trailer trash, pole dancing bimbos, corrupt cops, convenience store christians, hispanic teen-mums and cowboy junkies.While the trailers were fantastic, the cut-cut-cut MTV-style editing -- split-screens, stop-action door-slams, visual conceit switchovers -- gets genuinely annoying about five minutes into the film. Add to this trendy excursions into low-tech animation and fast-forward porno, not to mention the casting of various disinterred celebrities (mickey rourke, debbie harry) and you have an example of all that is puerile about indie movies today.A decent alt. soundtrack -- Billy Corgan's Zwan covering iron maiden -- helps give the film some cohesion, but there is not much going on that has not been done recently to far better effect in, say, Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, Being John Malkovich or even The Simpsons.",Spun

53,Newairbus,Naturalist with a Vengeance,3,10 July 2004,"Spun is not a merry movie. It describes people who have fallen through the nets of normal society into worthless, anguished existence fuelling their estrangement with drugs of the synthetic sort. Just as ""Dawn of the Dead"" can be regarded as a satire of consumer culture, this movie can be as well. If it leaves you with a putrid aftertaste and loathing of Western values, the makers have achieved one of their goals. Characters and the plot are immaterial; by and large the motion picture gives one the idea that Southern California is a self-cleaning oven for some of its inhabitants. It is shown how the drug-crazed people e.g. lose their concept of time and leave other people to suffer on their own devices without realizing that something is amiss. In other words, they take up the kind of behaviour which led to the famous death of the newborn in Trainspotting (1995).Mickey Rourke throws a mentionably substantial role as a violent, cocksure older man dealing/making/using drugs, which anticipates how he was cast later on in the 2nd episode of Sin City as Marv(in). It goes without saying that his lab explodes at one point or another.Even though this movie may spoil your life, spoilers are banned here, so go and see it for yourself and then come back here to complain.",Spun

It is a little unrealistic in some scenes, but overall the idea of being spun and doing absolutely nothing constructive is very realistic. The soundtrack to this is A+, I wish they'd release it. The actors are all amazing, and I'd say at their best in this.The story isn't really the most fantastic thing you'll find, but what is really fantastic about getting high of chemicals?The directing was phenomenal! It's amazing what you'll pick up every time you'll watch it. Any indie film lover will begin pointing out film-geek things like the symbolism of the car.

55,sjohntucson,Disturbingly Accurate (in a weird way) (small spoiler),7,21 September 2003,"This flick isn't for everyone, and judging by some of the posts, isn't for many people at all. I can't really decide if I liked it or not, to tell the truth. But, for me, it was symbolically accurate in a big way. I am a recovering speed freak (five years clean today, as a matter of fact), and this film brought back a flood of bad memories.The near-universal (on this board) comparisons with ""Requiem for a Dream"" are fair, I guess, but I don't see it as a rip-off so much as a recognition that ""RfaD"" came up with a really good & emotionally realistic way of describing what happens when the drug hits your brain, which, when you snort, smoke, or shoot speed, happens with frightening, uh, well, speed. The little filmatic cliche that both films used to indicate this was pretty powerful and, to me, pretty on the mark.The whole cartoony, seedy, porn-like atmosphere isn't really that far from the true experience, either. And that grinding-you-down feeling that really wears on you by the end of the film is, unfortunately, probably intentional. That was what life used to feel like for me, right up to the point of (here's that spoiler) crashing so hard that even an explosion won't wake you up.The person who posted that he couldn't accept that a drop-dead gorgeous stripper would sleep with these drugged-up losers is, I think, not really familiar with any addicted strippers. Folks in the grip of a serious drug problem will do most anything to get their dope, including sleeping with creepy unattractive losers like The Cook or Spider Mike. Addicts do that (1) to get more dope, and (2) because speed makes you really really uncontrollably horny. Emphasis on ""uncontrollably"", and (listen up you sweet young things of either gender) is a really good reason to stay off that path. People do stuff that they'd never think themselves even capable of, when they're addicted, and, sad as that is, that's the way it is.There's so much more of the movie that rang true for me, cartoonish as it is, and I really don't wanna go any further with that. I don't really think that this is a recommendation for the film, frankly. It probably doesn't do much for you if you never had a speed problem, and if you did, what it does do for you isn't necessarily a good thing.",Spun
56,t-paulsm,Taken for a serious trip!,7,2 December 2005,"Nothing like a flick that can make an ex-user feel all queer in the gut and edgy while watching it! I've been clean for going' on 10 years now, and this movie took me right back to the filth-ridden homes and crash pads of every junkie, crack head, me th head, etc... I've ever known. Nice job, folks! With outstanding & daringly creative direction on the part of Jonas Åkerlund, who, up until this movie is best known for directing music videos and documentaries, SPUN spins out of control in the way that the pointless, moving-on-to-the-next-score, sad lives of any speed freak's (or any other heavy drug user's) existence truly does.Thank god for the wicked sense of humor on the part of both Åkerlund & the film's writer's, Will De Los Santos & Creighton Vero, because without it, this would've been a bleak piece of celluloid to endure. Heck - When I look back on my trials and tribulations as a completely screwed addict, I can recall many a funny-as-hell story that accompanied the ridiculous self-inflicted tragedy that was my life. Ya have to laugh at it! It ain't all darkness and depression - just mostly - LOL! The animated snippets employed each time that our film's anti-hero ""Ross"" (played by the very talented Jason Schwartzman) slammed another bump 'o crank up his more-than-ample schnoz were fantastic! The style and the motion of the animation in ""Spun"" brought back memories of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" for me, and were equally as disturbing as Scarfe's work with Floyd, yet were even more graphically sexual and raw than his work if you can believe that! Some may argue that there was no solid plot line to the movie, and that they felt lost while watching it. I say ""Good!"" I do believe that the director intended this, as the only real plot line in the life of any addict I've ever known was to score and keep high and that's what this film does - over and over again! It was great seeing Peter Stormare's role as the whacked-out cop, swaggering around in full, proud multitude was hilarious! Accompanied by his big-mustachioed partner played by Alexis Arquette, all of their busts are played out a camera crew for the ""COPS"" like live broadcast show called ""BUST"" these two buffoons are the coke-induced Starsky & Hutch stars of.There is a veritable cornucopia of fun cameos throughout this flick - enough to amuse almost anyone I'd say! From Ron Jeremy as the strip club bar tender, Eric Roberts as the ultra-femme drug queen-pin known as ""The man"", Debbie Harry as the strong lesbian neighbor, to Judas Priest's Rob Halford as the gay porn clerk, it's a fun little trip down 80's rock 'n roll, porn lane! The movie was set in the mid-to-late 80's, as was reflected by the hair, wardrobe, cars, and general vibe of the film, but wasn't done so in such an in-your-face way as to become too tongue-in-cheek or too much of a spoof of the era, thank goodness.Brittany Murphy is so laced with the truth of what being spun is all about that my eyeballs kept drying up while watching her on screen perpetual bug-eyedness! She gave the character of Nikki a sweet and tragic subtle sadness as she talked of how everything would be fine once she had her son back in her arms.I did enjoy this film, and all of its fine performances. It ain't for those who don't want to see just how bleak and insane the lives of speed freaks can get, but for those wanting the ride, prepare to be SPUN! ~T.Paul www.t-Paul.com",Spun

Brittany Murphy really surprised me by doing some of her best work since Girl Interrupted.  And Patrick Fugit was pretty convincing as the bumbling idiot kid.

Spider(John Liguizamo) is his dealer, who's also friends with Nikki (Brittany Murphy), who's The Cook's (Mickey Rourke) girlfriend.

69,Andyboy_17,"A weird and twisted, but hilarious drug-movie!",8,30 June 2004,"The Swedish music-video director Jonas Åkerlund gives us a movie about drugs. It is heavily inspired by greater drug-movies like ""Trainspotting"" (1996) and ""Requiem For A Dream"" (2000). But unlike most of the drug-movies I've seen earlier, ""Spun"" has no moral or deep meaning and message, it's just a film made to entertain and make you laugh. And it SURE made ME laugh...Just as I wrote in the first line...this film is about drugs. It's hard to find a real plot in this film. It's just about people doing drugs, especially Speed (the word ""Spun"" means to be affected by Speed), and the their messed-up lives and everyday situations, seen through drug-affection. But while ""Spun"" doesn't have a real story, it has a some other qualities to offer: funny and well-created characters, good actors, a good soundtrack and A LOT of funny scenes and situations (it is bizarre humor though, that may not be recommended for everyone).The main character Ross (played by Jason Schwartzman) is mostly a ""ordinary"" drug-abuser trapped in the sick world of drugs. But the other characters are funny, interesting and original. And the actors gives us these unrealistic, and sometimes almost cartoon-like characters, through some good acting. Characters like Spider Mike, played by John Leguizamo, a man I usually hate to see on the screen, and Frisbee, played by Patrick Fugit are highlights. But the one I will be remembering is Mickey Rourke in his role as The Cook (the one who's cooking up all the drugs). I could try to describe him, but it would have taken up too much space. You just have to see him for yourself...funniest character and performance of the film. Brittany Murphy is not only good-looking in this film, she's doing a good performance as the stripper Nikki. And let's not forget about Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette, who shows up as some weird characters in some of the craziest scenes in the whole film.One thing that can be said about this film, is that it's weird. You can tell that Jonas Åkerlund is used to directing music-videos, because it may feel like a long music-video at times. And sometimes the film is so twisted that you just have to ask yourself ""what the hell is going on on the screen??!!"". To make this a ""different"" comedy, the director uses the style of fast-editing, experimental camera-work and the sometimes very shocking pictures, that was seen in Darren Aronofsky's drug-masterpiece ""Requiem For A Dream"" (2000). But the problem is that it's being over-used.I want to use a little comparison to the British film ""Human Traffic"" (1999). When I saw ""Human..."" I felt like the film was trying as hard as it could, to be like Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" (1996). It failed miserably, and in the end I thought it was a bad movie. Now, when I watched ""Spun"" I felt like it was trying to do the same thing with ""Requiem..."". It didn't fail the same way as ""Human..."" though, but it is not even close to being comparable with ""Requiem For A Dream"". However, ""Spun"" makes it up with all the humor, and the fact that it is more of the ""mindless fun"" kind of comedy, that ""Human Traffic"" wasn't. But as I mentioned earlier, I think the style of the film (which was perfectly used in ""Requiem For A Dream"") is over-used, and became trying as the film approached it's climax. Therefor, I doubt I will be watching it from beginning to end, one more time.Overall, ""Spun"" was a VERY funny comedy, driven by it's well-created characters, to me. This is not humor that fits everyone though, and there will probably be someone (as always) that'll say that it's glorifying the use of drugs. I will recommend it though, if you want to take a trip to the miserable world of drugs, trough a different comedy.8.5 out of 10",Spun
70,stoned_bunnies,"A little typical for a drug movie, but worth watching",7,10 June 2006,"Spun is basically a movie about six methaphetamine addicts. Their life stories are sort of strung together to create a chaotic plot that is the movie. The protagonist, Ross (played by Jason Schwartzman), becomes his Crystal Meth cook's personal driver in exchange for free drugs. During this time, Ross gets lost in the crazy mess of methaphetamine as he tries to struggle with his love life and with these unstable new people he is meeting.The cast is pretty all-star, with Mena Suvari, Patrick Fugit, Mickey Rourke and Brittany Murphy all playing main characters. Also, the soundtrack is by Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, and Blondie's Deborah Harry plays the protagonist's lesbian neighbor.I thought that this movie was a good portrayal of the bizarre and incomprehensible world of drugs. There are no inhibitions, principles or limits. For instance, there are some pretty in-your-face bondage scenes and great hallucinations presented through cartoons (sometimes erotic cartoons). The cinematography was my favorite thing about the entire movie. I loved how the camera took you inside the peoples' minds. The whole mood of the movie changes with each character's view of life.I fell madly in love with many actors after having seen this movie. Jason Schwartzman, for instance, has gained my approval as an actor now. He did an exceptional job in this movie as a junkie who lets himself fall deeper and deeper into Crystal Meth addiction as his life ""spins"" out of control (hence the title, I suppose). As for Suvari's character, Cookie, she grossed me out. Honestly, by the end of the movie, I could not stand her anymore. The character was the junkie girlfriend of the drug dealer (John Leguizamo) and you get to watch her chewing gum compulsively and then interrupting sex with her boyfriend to take a constipated dump, which you actually see as it plops into the toilet water. That's exactly what I meant by the movie has ""no inhibitions."" Plus, I hear that the characters are based on reality. Creepy? Indeed.I really did love this movie and have seen it twice already, but I couldn't give it more than a 7/10. Acting, plot and visual added together creates a pretty good movie but not something I imagine most people, or myself, sitting through multiple times.",Spun

But the story really is about the meeting of East and West: Keaton's Hunt Stevenson personifies America, brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath. Watanabe's Kazuhiro personifies Japan, on top of the heap with a successful system, but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals. The movie's plot, flawed as it is, simply provides a framework for the conflict, and eventually synthesis, of their two personalities.)Again, in nutshell, SPUN is a total piece of sh*t.I have no comment on Gung HoOnce more. Piece of sh*t.* means i",Spun

That's the only explanation for my reaction to this film.When I was young and embroiled in the kind of culture that this film depicts, I'd probably have found it funny. As it is, I didn't make it through the first hour.This film is the mutant offspring of 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'American Pie'. Visuals ripped off from the first (and superior) film, sense of humour from the second. I thought it was a film about drugs, that's why i rented it, but it's actually just a schoolboy masturbatory fantasy. Strippers, porn, bondage, submissive buxom blondes, you get the picture.I guess the producers felt it was 'edgy'. Well in my opinion it goes right to the edge of the precipice of poor taste, then falls off it.Avoid if you're aged over 16, or female - 2/10.",Spun
74,nexus23,Instant Repeater,10,23 April 2005,"One of the best movie about drugs and new generation. Åkerlund assembled a cast that became great by interpreting the funny faces of a sub life in the wild . Also Åkerlund assembled over his crew a beautiful soundtrack , who perfectly follows the scenes , giving to the whole movie a total harmony . It's not giving back a movie of this genre made with ingredients like drug theme or underground life or still funny irony , there's love , ethic , knowledge of road life , knowledge accomplished in the Mickey Rourke's character , but there's not a hymn to any drug effect as solution or tasty idea to support the mind of who keeps to be a survivor . The final looks as a new beginning , not a ""life continues.."" but a painful waking up after the sweetest illusion .",Spun

76,robert2615,"misunderstood, not to be compared to Requiem, which is way over the top at the end BTW",7,25 October 2003,"I have seen ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Trainspotting"" and yet this is a different take on drugs. The music is just perfect for the scenes (Billy Corgan and others. Billy has always seemed like a lost messed up suburban kid to me). I've never tried Meth but this film seems to get it right according to former users who have written in. This film funny to some but to me it is most definitely depressing. There is no great plot and this is the point, no upward movement...but maybe this is the reason why people are negative about it.Excellent performances by Mickey Rourke and Jason Schwartzman.(Now, a rambling discussion on the sickness in our culture, skip it or my apologies but don't say I didn't warn you.) Oh well, I am from the big city, I grew up in Manhattan, NYC. It wasn't until I commissioned as an officer in the Navy to pay for my college that I got out and saw the ""real"" America. (NYC is like an island off the coast of the U.S.A.) I saw up close the incredibly depressing wasteland, strip mall car culture of endless fast food chains, auto shops, Walmarts, gas station marts and trailer parks. America today is people with no idea what to do with themselves. That is the feeling I got from this film and Ackerlund, being a foreigner just hit it so right (but I should consider the possibility that I, being from NYC and for all practical purposes a foreigner, might just see things the same way as he.) Anyway, we keep reading more and more about the destructiveness of Meth. Just in the news recently (July 2005). Meth is a real problem but I think also a symptom of the emptiness of our modern life. The strip mall culture that we have allowed to flourish...why? and in the name of what? Is this really what freedom's about? Walmart's and disposable everything? Europe's got it's historical problems for sure, Asia is a pit in terms of human rights, Africa is all f&ked up corruption, chaos and tribal bloodshed. We note Americanos have problems related to rapid expansion - that and slavery, that bane that may forever haunt us and I believe is our bad ""karma"" as a nation. Everything in this country seems cheap, disposable, take out, fast food...and the rest of the world is taking our lead or maybe just being forced to go along. But this American way of life can't last forever, we can't keep control just with military might. Here come the invasion of the Indian IT programmers, customer service reps, hard science and engineering PhDs, overseas Radiologists, and outsourced who knows what. Our standard of living will go to the toilet, because captains of industry are looking out only for themselves, the cheapest labor, the people who will accept the shittiest working conditions and lowest wages, and you all can just suck it.

77,Lembrowski,It's not bad,7,14 February 2004,"Jonas Åkerlund has done a lot of greats videos, and like other musicvideo directors (Spike Jonze etc) he had to do a motion picture. Åkerlund has been know as an controversial director, who uses a lot of sex, drugs and violence in his creations. No wonder ""Spun"" circles around these topics. The cast is great but the lack of experience in motion pictures from Åkerlunds part shines trough. He can not get the full potential out of the cast. Some are great, Mickey Rourke and the two policemen played by Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette. But what I really liked about this movie is the soundtrack. And even if the cinematography sometimes is very irritating, i like this movie. It's not the best piece of work ever done, but it's not that bad. And if Åkerlund just get some more experience in film industry I think he really can do some great films in the future.

It is a good little film which follows Ross a college drop out who is addicted to meth, he ends up as a sort of taxi driver for The Cook, this is where he meets Nikki and one of the many misfits who inhabit this film. Ross gets into a series of weird episodes and meets some even weirder characters like Spider Mike a off the wall drug dealer and Cookie his even more crazy girlfriend.

With the feeling of a fly on the wall documentary this film shows with little effort the dirty side of meth-amphetamine and the phychosis that comes with it. The state of Brittany Murphy and Mena Survari is priceless and will probably never been seen again other than in this movie. If you've ever got high you will appreciate this film, if you have not then it will just be a curious insight into a world few people know.

83,film_fiend,A generation that is terrified of reality.,10,11 September 2002,"Crystal Meth. I've never understood the fascination for a drug that turns you into a raving, sleep deprived, fiend. Those of you who have tried meth, or know someone who is a regular user, know that Meth heads are the sketchiest of the sketch. Jonas Akerlund successfully captures the anxiety of the drug, and the resulting distortion of reality and priorities. Jason Schwartzman finally busts out of his nerdy teen typecast and proves himself as an accomplished actor. He reminds me of a young Judd Nelson. I can't believe that Mena Suvari is in a film where she is hideous, and that Brittany Murphy finally gets to act.The plot tells a story that goes nowhere but sums up a generation that is afraid of reality. With people dying all over the world of Alzheimer's and other memory affecting diseases, why is it that some people spend their entire lives trying to obliterate their memories?Akerlund uses quirky camera movements and a unique visual style to depict the wasteland that is addiction. My only complaint is that the film may be presented as too much of a rock video. This is not surprising taking into account that Akerlund is responsible for such videos as Prodigy's Smack My Bitch Up and Madonna's Ray of Light. The dosing scenes are very reminiscent of Requiem For a Dream. Some originality would have been nice. Debby Harry makes a great butch.",Spun

85,luby_matt,"""Requiem for a Dream"" ripoff falls far short",1,3 September 2003,"""Spun"" is quite simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Not only was it poorly made, but it is quite clearly a cruddy ripoff of ""Requiem for a Dream.""First of all, if you are looking for a plot in this movie, forget it.  It is remarkably pointless, unless one supposes it is supposed to be that way since it is a movie about meth addicts.Secondly, the acting is not that spectacular.  Jason Schwartzman, who was wonderful in ""Rushmore,"" fails to really put a lot of life into his character in this movie.  He seems a bit unbelievable as a good guy meth addict.  The drug cops are good actors dealing with a horrible script. They are so painfully bad it is ridiculous.  The director tried WAY too hard to make these guys funny and failed miserably.  And the sort of hero of the movie, ""the Chef,"" is no great shakes, either.  The thing I remember most about the Chef is one painfully delivered monologue about pornography....pitiful.The worst part of this movie, though, is probably its blatant ripoff of all the visual effects of ""Requiem.""  It has the same high speed closeups when a person takes a hit.  It does some of the same incoherent mind sequence kind of things.  It is a shameless ripoff, except with a plot that is much worse.Overall, the plot is quite unrealistic, for a movie realistic in intent. I hated this movie.  Definite thumbs down.",Spun

I came in expecting a juvenile comedy full of sex and drugs but what I got was much more. This may be one of the best films I've seen in a long time; the script and the actors were all amazing. The script and the directing portrayed all the characters as disgusting, detestable individuals but the actors made you care about them. When the characters cried I cried, when they laughed I laughed. Nothing about this movie will (or should) be nominated for an award, or receive critical acclaim but some of the actors performances were on level with those of Hollywood legends.The true stars of this movie are Mickey Rourke and John Leguizamo; in every scene they were in I couldn't take my eyes off of them. Their personality and charisma enhanced each and every scene. Jason Schwartzman played an emotionally detached speed head that you never really got close too, but that was the point. He played an emotionless character but it allowed everyone else too shine. Schwartzman's wooden performance made everyone else pop; from Mickey Rourkes P**sy Speech, to John Leguizamo's paranoid rants, to Brittany Murphy's tantrums every actor made me laugh, shout, and cry.I've recommended this movie to all my friends and they loved it.

Spun is such a contrived Requiem-imitator that it is nearly unpleasant to watch. Close-ups of pupils dilating when taking a hit? Colorful characters trying not to admit they have a problem? A final montage of the characters in static positions while a somber song plays? This movie has been made! No amount of epileptic editing and over-exposure can change that. It's story has nothing. It tries to take a new slant on the drug tradedy by adding humor, but it only produces sad imitation after sad imitation of Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.

This movie so strongly reflects many of the aspects of the behavior of old friends and acquaintances that I thought these characters came right from my old neighborhood. Personalities that are paranoid beyond the belief of the straight mind, leading to acts of ultimate stupidity by people who are trying to act cool and blend in! The pace of the film is geared to assist the viewer in experiencing the mind set of the speed user. Several visual tricks also enhance the feeling of a Topsy-turvey world put into fast forward.

101,Cleopatra2U,Nothing new here.,6,1 December 2003,"This is the first review I've written for IMDb.  Strangely, it's not about a movie that either enthralls me or appalls me,  but one that is somewhere in-between.Having been an avid fan of drug movies for many years, I believe that I can conclusively say that ""Spun"" contains nothing new.  Its atmosphere-heavy, plot-thin structure is reminiscient of ""Dazed and Confused"" in that it covers several days in the life of the characters as opposed to following them through some sort of crisis to a conclusion.  Its using sequences -- audiovisuals of sniffing, smoking, or shooting up followed by visuals of swiftly-constricting pupils -- seem not-too-loosely (and rather poorly) copied from ""Requiem for a Dream"".  And the animations at first drift like the ones from ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and later pound like the ones from ""Natural Born Killers"".What saves ""Spun""'s watchers from being caught in a myriad of drug movie deja-vus are strong performances from the entire cast, particularly the heretofore unbeknownst to me Jason Schwartzman as the seemingly hopeless, curiously twisted, yet likably reluctant chemist's assistant.  Despite -- or perhaps due to -- the convincingness of all the major characters (except Brittany Murphy's Nikki, who was just too fresh-faced to be the hardcore meth-head she purported to be), I was left wanting to know more about what made each of them the way they are...

You can clearly see what this flick wants to be and portray, but it only delivers a one-dimensional, ""drawn"" schematics of the destination point.

Over-acting does not make a great film.  Outlandish plotting does not make a great film. But we have them all in this wannabee movie. I've known some crystal meth addicts in my time and not one of them had hot sex with well endowed strippers who found it OK to tie them up and leave them for 3 days. Look around you.  Are the crystal meth kids that hot? Most crystal meth people I know are walking into walls.  They are truly sad. Not a lot of good looking faces in that mix. Thanks to Mena Suvari for showing us what poop looks like.  Thanks to Jon Leguizomo for showing us that it is possible to jerk off while jumping around on a bed.

However, it's not too difficult to recognize the veil of bulls*** that Ross has placed before his own eyes.and this is quickly solidified by a message left towards the beginning of the film, where Amy bids Ross `happy belated birthday,' followed by a demand for the money he owes.Ross does not let himself believe her rejection, even though it's obvious that, deep within his soul, he is not only aware of his Loss, but he's pining away because of it.  Not to say that's the solitary reason he's pounding Crystal Meth, rather the subsequent murky perception, which allows Ross to fool himself into thinking that Amy is still his Girl, is an added bonus to the drug.  Not once does this film imply that Ross has a `reason' to be twisted on Crank.Right, the Brilliance.  From the start of the adventure, Ross chatters of Amy, his wonderful girlfriend, speaking as if they're still `together,' even though it's pretty clear that she's moved on with her life.  During the course of the movie he mentions her repeatedly, and calls her every chance he gets, only to talk to her answering machine.The culmination of his clouded fantasy comes to be when she finally meets up with him, and Reality comes slamming down.  Sure, he's all jumpy in the park where he's hoping to convene with her (he has been on Meth for the past three sleepless days, after all), but then he sees Amy- a beautiful angel, dressed in a thin white dress that has a breeze of its own- and that gush of warm euphoria floods his veins.  For one tiny moment, it's as if everything he's said about her is true- what they have is Real- and the mere fact that she's floating toward him is a reaffirmation of their union.But this movie is far more honest than that.She's cordial at first, but quickly notices he's tweaked-out.  After a short discourse, she rejects an embrace, and walks away.And that's it.  Amy is out of the picture, having actually only spent about a minute really there.  With this abrupt encounter, the myth that Ross had created and accepted as Real is exposed for what it was: a lie, one that he produced, and insisted on believing.The aforementioned Brilliance is not just this scene, but also everything building up to it, and all that happens thereafter.  Before this occasion, one of the many calls Ross makes to Amy from a payphone subtly betrays the true Message of this movie.  A close inspection will reveal that the telephone's latch is pointed down, signifying that there is no connection. Sure, it's suggested that he's leaving yet another message on Amy's machine, but does it truly matter?  He's not really communicating, he's just rambling on, feeding his imagination that lets him feel everything's OK between them. Truth, on the other hand, gives an altogether different observation, and the fact is that Ross is living in an illusion.  What's even worse is that he is the creator of his chimera.From a detached standpoint, it seems that every piece of Hope is shot down as quickly as it surfaces.  However, this formula is not that simple.  The real Hope is shown in Amy, as she accepts responsibility for her own life. Other than that, all Hope presented is entirely conjured up, each character creating such to support that their current Paths are fine, and therefore there's no reason to drastically change directions, just get things together.And that is what this film is really about.  The Meth nuance is just an example of one way that people lie to themselves to justify their own mirages, creating sometimes elaborate rationales that excuse their own faults.  There are certainly plenty more small hints of this, but this scene in particular aggressively drives the nail into the coffin that so many of us live in.At one point, The Cook (Mickey Rourke) tells of a childhood memory, in which his mother was drowning newborn puppies.  `I asked her why,' he narrates, `and she said, 'I'm just killing what I can't take care of.'  And then she looked at me and said, 'I wish I could do the same for you.'  It is with this statement that a Lesson is offered- Life can be unbearably rough, but the only way to make it better is to be accountable for our personal actions.This is a folly of Humanity: it's much easier to make up excuses than admit mistakes.  Instead of accepting that a change of Course is the answer, people all too often lie to themselves, insisting that their actions are reasonable, and it's just other variables that are to blame.  Blame Society, blame the Government, blame Liberals, blame Conservatives, blame G.W., blame T.V., blame Drugs, blame the Devil, blame Prince, blame Greed, blame everyone and everything other than yourself.  Blame.  Blame is a much simpler action than Confession.or so it seems.  The fact is that such an attitude only makes things harder, and practically vetoes progress.To relegate Spun as a `drug movie' is a grave injustice, for this film is nothing short of a Masterpiece in every way.  Its humor is remarkably clever; its dramatic tone is powerfully heady; and its social commentaries are vigorously exceptional.  Sure, I imagine this movie would be great to watch stoned; its dazzling cinematography and consistent hilarity (albeit fairly sarcastic and morbid at times) make this a must for anyone who enjoys the likes of Kevin Smith, Cheech & Chong, Reefer Madness, and so on.  But (even more so than Smith's ventures) underneath the surface, there is a level of remarkable intellect void of shame.The sad thing is that I suspect that most theaters won't be showing this one, as Spun does not cater to the Mainstream.  After all, in lieu of an MPAA score there's `This film is not yet rated due to the use of drugs, strippers, and open flames.'  Personally, I feel that taking anything out of this film, minute as it may be, would dilute its necessary energy.  Being that this includes some intense sexuality (even though it's often animated, and usually funny in a twisted sort of way), it's understandable that cinema managements have been hesitant to feature this piece.  Thus, bucking adherence to the respective Norm, it seems that most will have to wait until it's released on DVD.  That is, unless more theaters have a courage similar to Cleveland's  Cedar Lee, and take the gamble.©Jake McGee - Get Underground",Spun
106,daemori_chonsa,A terrific rip off,3,12 December 2003,"I don't know how these guys got away with it. I can see the prep for this movie - a bunch of guys with camera equipment at hand with a bunch of notebooks at hand while they watch a bunch of superior movies. Theft is grand in this movie in so many ways. The quick cuts of Requiem of a Dream sans the symbolism. An old school cast in a ""hip"" new film showing they are still cool (Deborah Harry, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts instead of Pam Grier, Robert Forster, or John Travolta), and those extended time shots that were so effective in Drugstore Cowboy and so much of a ripoff in Spun.
This movie succeeds in nothing more than proving that: 1) special effects and camera tricks don't make a movie good. 2) just because there are guys on drugs with hearts of gold it means we should care about them 3) some actors who were once hot commodities in Hollywood are not hot for a reason.And don't get me wrong. I loved Mickey in Barfly, Angel Heart, and Body Heat. I didn't mind him in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (the old American who has outgrown his welcome and finally gives up - sound familiar?). But this movie gets five stars only on a scale of shrivelled lemons.",Spun

Jonas Åkerlund has balls, I haven't seen a drug-related movie as good as this after Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. The movie starts with ""Based on the truth and lies"" and after that It's just great. I gave this movie a 9 and not a 10 only because it was too obvious that J. Åkerlund has directed only music-videos before. But in another way it was great usage of many different angles and I'm starting to regret that I didn't give it a 10.

It is great, because it humanizes drug addicts. it shows that a speed freak is never just a speed freak, but a person with a life in distress. too often people with drug addictions are dismissed as eyesores or vagabonds who deserve harsh treatment, but the movie takes us into their lives. Most Importantly, the characters are not supposed to be heroes, they are just a cross-section of junkie culture. plus, the scenes with the cops are hilarious, and seeing Debbie Harry throw a six-pack at a guy's head and then kick him in the gut was priceless. To review, deals with oft over-looked subject matter in an objective way, some great cameos, imaginative film-making, I give it an A-Plus.",Spun

Even though the drug of topic is methamphetamine, this movie just as easily could have been about cocaine or heroin. By that I mean in relation to how the addiction works and how the addict behaves. This movie delivers a powerful message and a great lesson if you are able to derive it. What happens in ""Spun"" is frightening, but it does happen and is very real. The cast does such a great job that I almost want to believe that they have some first hand experience. That could mean either living it or witnessing it, I will leave that for you to decide.

I love it also because for every character I know someone who you can compare to them. The realism of it is what makes me like it so much. The movie is basically the life of this group of druggies, busy wasting time doing basically nothing. Their only real activities are finding ""it"", making ""it"", and getting spun. In a weird way it's a touching story. It's all so amazing and addictive, every friend I have shown this movie to falls in love with it. Whether you are sober or not the movie is a must see.

I have never seen a movie with such disgusting scenes, and three of those scenes were just too disgusting to watch. The first was when Frisbee (Patrick Fugit) was having, at least what I think it is, a steak. The look of his meal, the way he eats and not mention his mother siting in her filth was sickening! The second scene was when Cookie (Mena Suvari) was in the toilet, there are no words to describe it, and can't imagine how any actress would agree do this scene. The final scene was when Spider Mike (John Leguizamo) was practicing his ""habit"", I just don't understand what the director was trying achieve from all this!

112,lord-of-the-garbage,Not bad but definitely not the best drug movie,8,19 March 2006,"This movie left me confused. It was thrilling, you felt that you are somehow on speed too and you just can't get out. The movie is visually awesome, most of the time crazy like when someone takes a sniff, the screen goes wild, but thats about it. The story was really predictable and linear... It goes on so slowly in the beginning that you almost fall asleep but then it speeds up a bit. The characters' characteristics are supported by some really good actors. It was fun to watch but don't expect something psychological or any kind of a drama. Seemed more like a comedy to me. If you are a fan of crazy-cut music videos stretched into a half an hour this is the movie you are looking for.

But most people aren't very sympathetic towards drug users. If you like this film you must see 'Requiem for a Dream'. I viewed it in my Avant Garde film class in college recently.

I really connected with Spun because I lived through similar experiences as the character Ross, except my drug was white, not speed. I was the guy with the car, drove a '93 Buick Regal that became known as the ""crack taxi."" Never met any real cooks, just a lot of dealers, and I drove them all over the place to pick up more, get high, meet other dealers, and waste time at strip bars. I was even having a really tough time with my g/f at the time as well, right down to the part where she had broken up with me and I didn't know it.I was really impressed with the choppy, frequent cuts, and find they really communicate the state of mind you're in when your on any speedy drug, focus cutting out to something unimportant a lot, jumping back and forth to anything that looks like it needs attention. The scene where Ross and Nikki kissed was, for some reason, the most important part of the movie to me. I wish I could articulate it, but I don't know where to start.

Great performances, Mickey is really an underrated actor. I have to add more, so I love music, and I think Mr. Ackerland should really listen to the band TOOL. If he doesn't already, he'll find a lot of drama and vagueness in the song's.

118,causticchris2000,Big time fail,1,2 January 2007,"Spun is indeed a wild ride, but for more discerning viewers there is little to be gotten from this film.The plot and more importantly the motivation of the characters is incomplete at best. Albeit these characters are operating on methamphetamines or 'speed', but some actions such as the main character tying up a stripper and leaving her in his apartment unbelievable, mainly because of the lack of knowledge of the character's background.The pupil dilating rapid shots of when the characters take the drug is reminiscent of Requiem for a Dream, and as I was watching made me think more and more about that film, and at the end I was convinced that it was nothing more than a knock off of it.The more troubling thing to me was the 'farce' nature of the film. The characters are given cute names such as ""spider-mike"" and ""frisbee"" and the police officers that investigate the meth problem surrounding the town put on a deranged ""Cops"" performance, and are even doing smack themselves when they conduct their police activities. To me, all this didn't make sense and seemed to glorify the use of the drug. The only consequences the main characters meet is a cliché mug shot sequence, and Jason schwartzmans character is denied by his former girlfriend yet again.I could not identify with this film or the characters. Perhaps to understand this movie people must actually use meth, in which a documentary of the actual effects of the drug on people and society would be much more disturbing and realistic. Giant failure, and I really thing this is just a wanna be Requiem for a Dream, which is by far a better portrayal of drug use and the tragedy that ensues.",Spun

121,film-unit,Not enough kinds of lame to describe it,3,13 November 2003,"There are two ways a drug flick can be anything other than cringingly awful. One, in the style of Dazed and Confused, is to have excellent dialogue. The other, in the style of Trainspotting is to focus on the irreparable breakdown of the characters' relationships and mental states. In short, it can be funny (Pulp Fiction) or hopelessly, wrist-slittingly depressively dark (Junk).The problem with Spun is that it does neither of these things particularly convincingly. The opening scene of Ross trying to score leads you to believe it's going to be a comedy until you get bored of waiting for someone to say something witty and wonder if the bar is still selling chips and if anyone will notice if you just leave. You have to wait until the Cook's patriotic pussy speech in the porn shop for anything remotely original, and this is spoiled by the hallucinated over-emphasis. The effect is not dissimilar to how the Clerks scene about the second death-star blowing up would be if it was against clips from Jedi: the humour is derived from the conversation juxtaposed with the ordinariness of the situation; the flag, music and costume spoil this.And the attempts at darkness are done poorly as well. The scene where Ross ties up his stripper girlfriend is disturbing and sickening, but nothing comes of this treatment. The Amy obsession continues this annoying bathos. In the film, there are no consequences of drug addiction and so no character development and little interest is evoked.Which isn't to say that *everything* is wrong. The sequence with Ross and Nicki in the car towards the end was intensely pathetic. The animation was intriguing. The wrestling motif was well used, but perhaps a little deep for an audience that would endure long enough to think about it. And the instant when the drug was taken was good.But all these things could have been so much better. The surround-scratching sequence from 25th Hour could have been put to excellent use in the car and drug-taking, and the animation was nothing compared with the more relevant and apt section of Kill Bill Volume 1.We were one of the first cinemas in the UK to show this film, and hopefully will be one of the last.",Spun
122,jesseflati,I haven't seen a film this bad in a theater since the third installment of the Cannonball Run series.,1,25 April 2003,"Spun is undoubtedly a film that will get a lot of attention. Fast cuts, plenty of sex and drugs, outrageous characters, and good music. Unfortunately most of the attention it will receive is from people with very short attention spans. The fact that it took two people to write a film where no one says anything relevent is enough to make me long for the days of a drug movie with some substance and wit (ie: Trainspotting). Mickey Rourke is the lone savior of this film from getting a rating of zero. Why couldn't he get more roles like this in the eighties? What a vile, loathesome character. The thing that most people won't understand is that Spun is a comedy, most of the characters are designed to make you laugh out loud, unfortunately, there is nothing funny about most of the subject matter. It is ugly and pathetic, which wouldn't be a problem if it only knew what it was trying to tell you. Spun suffers from the toocoolsyndrome (ie: The Doom Generation), in which the filmmaker is obviously trying to make you think his film is really hip and cutting edge in an attempt to mask its shortcomings in the script and the subject matter, how many rock star cameos do you really need, (""Dude it's Billy Corgan!""). This film makes no intelligent attempt at an anti-drug message,(ie:Requiem for a Dream, which Spun blatantly steals from with no shame), therefore much like Alex Cox's Sid & Nancy, it glorifies its subject matter which is kind of irresponsible, sure the characters may have really bad acne or relationship problems or bad teeth, but so do most non drug using teens. Jason Shwartzman and Patrick Fugit once had some Hollywood promise, after Rushmore, Shwartzman made the awful Slackers and now this, Fugit whose innocence was so charming in the otherwise awful Almost Famous, takes the cake as the most annoying character in the history of film, truly an embarrassment and a pox on his career, I just kept wishing someone would shoot him, along with co star Brittany (TheLatterDayMelanieGriffith) Murphy. There is one scene in which Deborah Harry,(Cool Dude! Blondie!) assaults an abusive male character after he abuses his girlfriend, after which, in what I assume is supposed to be a compliment, Mickey Rourke's character calls her a tough ""Dyke"". Cloudy message indeed, after standing up for the plight of abused women, the script turns on them by insulting a gay woman's sexuality. Hip post 90s directors need to ease up on all the fast editing and hip factor to attempt to create a film in which style and substance work together to create the desired effect (ie: McCabe & Mrs. Miller). The problem with music video director Jonas Akerlund is that he doesn't seem to know what effect he wants to spin, resulting in a film that is all dressed up but has no place to go but down. One of the worst films I have ever seen. 1 out of 10",Spun
123,yael4ever,"""Artistically Capacitated""",10,26 February 2003,"While standing in the Neverending lineup for the Toronto Film Festival, I couldn't help but think about if it was really worth it to be wasting hours of my life just to be seeing a simple little film called ""Spun"". Now that I have seen it, I shock myself when thinking about how after waiting in a 2 hour line up - I was ready to leave. Jonas Akerlund's work on Spun is nothing but ""truly genius"" when it comes to cinematography and creating structure for the New Independent Films. My attention was held through every scene and after hearing his ""Media conference"" it is obvious why. He is such a creative man with a knowledable grasp of what is different. I can't help but shudder when thinking about watching most movies/films that are related to drugs, but this one was different. This film was artistic and expressive in showing the many pros and cons as well as the lifestyle that is ingested when you first consume your first feeling of ""ecstasy"" (being speed in this movie). I truly hope that there are more directors and filmmakers that can take tips from Mr. Akerlund and apply them to their own movies because there is nothing that is more worthy of time. If you are looking for a Hollywood ""Studio Type"" Business Blockbuster - Look elsewhere. This film is artistically clever and is more than enough to feed the spirit of anyone who is in need of a different taste in film.I'd give Spun a rating of 4**** because of its creative genius as well as Casting transitions. The actors and actresses were truly remarkable when taking on roles and characters that they had never worked with before. From Jason Schwartzman going from the clever and childishly geeky Rushmore student to a Mature (aside from drugwise)manly and entertaining characater that you can't help but adore, to Mena Suvari the annoyingly perfect, sweet and beautiful ""American Pie"" actress to the angry, unattractive, raging lounger.It seems like an all star young adult cast that is just not properly exposed to the media. You want acting skills? These are actors!Wonderful Film that makes me crave more of Jonas Akerlund. I could hardly be more impressed.",Spun

The story is interesting and the performances are great, especially Mickey Rourke, who truly makes this story worth watching. He's cool and calm, yet intense and serious all in one.If I have any problem with this film, it's that it's trying very hard to copy the style of Requiem For A Dream through its choice of sound and ""hip hop"" montages, but it couldn't come close to Requiem.

But the plot was not as well thought out as Requium. One thing that bothered me about this movie though (being a recovering addict to many different substances) is the lack of realism of the characters eyes when they got high. Their pupils got constricted (pinpoint) when they got high on the crank when they should have gotten dilated. Opiates make your pupils constricted and uppers such as Coke and Meth make your pupils dilate. Other than that inaccurate portrayal of a side effect of drug use it was a decent way to kill an hour and a half. Just don't expect to learn anything and take it as it is.,Spun

She looks like she's on crank without the crank make-up effects, so she fits right in.Everything else about it stunk!  Even Jason Scwartzman, who is great in all of the other movies he's been in, was bad in this one. The story was predictable and didn't really have a point, the sub stories didn't go anywhere.

130,jimwilliams84,An interesting tale of redemption in the drug world,7,18 January 2006,"My first reaction to the film was the above, one-sentence ""summary"", and that alone. But, as I considered it further, I came up with the following...This film somewhat reminded me of Requiem for a Dream in that the characters' consequences continued to mount, building toward an uncertain ending at which point the sinners had all gotten what they deserved, as had the innocent, and the main character who was somewhere in-between lost everything but simultaneously was freed of his addiction.How, you may ask? That last part didn't occur to me until shortly after the movie was over and I began writing this rather short review in my mind. First, after losing everything (mainly his girlfriend in a brutal, abrupt, but expected scene) he had two choices: 1. to continue on his self-destructive path, growing ever closer to oblivion, which seems unlikely considering his morals and values or 2. to pick up the pieces that were left and begin to grow, to regain and re-establish himself. Second, all of his using ""friends"" were either incarcerated or dead (the two most common ends for the drug user), so his access to the drugs was limited. For me, this gave the movie far more credibility, depth, and meaning than I had originally thought possible.Perhaps I'm completely mistaken, but considering that I am a recovering cocaine and heroin addict, I think I may have slightly more insight into the subject than many people. IMHO that is, as always...",Spun

132,Vvornth,"A high speed chase on life, no chemicals added",10,14 July 2003,"The whole movie is a 4 day meth trip for all characters involved which just follows them in their daily lives trying to score some of their drug of choice, dealing with pushers, and having the cops (who amusingly enough, also snort before every bust) on their back. It makes no effort to take a stance on the actual drug usage but just concentrates on the characters. To me the entire notion that every movie concerning drugs must have a pro-drug or anti-drug message is ridiculous. Following the same logic every movie with shooting would take a similar stance on whether guns are bad or not. So it is refreshing to see that the movie isn't slowed down by any moral stance.SPUN is more TRAINSPOTTING than it is REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. (which I felt was overly pretentious) The tempo is really high which suits the drug the movie centers around. The characters aren't exactly realistic but rather more like living cartoons with great performances to match their energy. 90 very enjoyable minutes that will have you coming back watching it again in order to spot all the cameos and fine cinematic details. I'm buying this one when it's out on DVD the 22nd.

Spun should be ranked as a masterpiece along with Requiem NOT because of their association with drugs, but because they are both exposés on the tragedy of humanity.  Their only other similarity is that they use (in different ways) drugs as a way to make abstract ideas more concrete and more believable.Moreover, Åkerlund does not intend Spun to have a conventional plot as Aronofsky does with Requiem.  The characters as a whole represent humanity, with all of our fetishes and (arguably) tragic masochisms (sometimes fed by sadism) beautifully showcased in all of its glory, which means it's really ugly and disturbing.  No, we're not all meth users/dealers/abusers.  The meth is metaphorical; it is any impetus behind the insanely speedy lives of modern humanity.  People are going to and fro faster now than they have combined up until our creation.In the words of George Jung in Blow (which IS a drug movie, but not exclusively), ""life passes most people by while they're still making grand plans for it.""  Tony Wilson in 24 Hour Party People makes a good analogy: ""it's like being on a fantastic fairground ride, centrifugal forces throwing us wider and wider.  And it's all right because there's this brilliant machine at the centre that's gonna bring us back down to earth.  Now imagine the machine breaks.  For a while it's even better because you're really flying, but then you're [you know what]ed, because nobody beats gravity.""The machine in this instance is meth.  In your case, it may be your job, your desires, or your addictions.  That's right, YOUR instance, because in the end, this movie is about YOU.  The characters in Spun, like modern man, speed up, speed up, speed up, and then crash.  Do we ever take time out of our busy lives to appreciate life and to appreciate what's really important to us, not what we think is important?  Or do we push push push until finally we stop, trying to relive what we never actually got to live in the first place, but alas, too late?The acting, the directing, the music, the cinematography, is all great and always serves a purpose, although rarely ever within the actual ""plot."" But humanity does many things that serve no purpose, so Åkerlund covers every base.  If you like Following, Memento, or Requiem because they are brilliant showcases of humanity, then I highly recommend Spun.  If you're looking for a drug movie, or a conventional plot with a climax (assuming you know what the actual definition of a climax is), then I would recommend renting this movie, but not expecting too much out of it.  If you cringe at the idea of looking and examining yourself naked in front of a mirror (take ""naked"" to mean what you want it to), then I don't recommend watching this movie because you will be horrified.",Spun

It is hard to take at times, but this is what is going on in parts of the country whether we choose to see them or not.Brittney Murphy is excellent in this performance as is John Leguizamo.I like quirky movies that don't seem like they could happen in true life, but I know like this one they do, with the exception of the cops.",Spun

I don't care, and that movie critic narcissism is tiring.""Spun"" is just a downright entertaining film to watch.  The sequences were done excellent, the subject matter was interesting (who else is sick of drug movies being about heroin and coke?), and the actors were superb.  Not to mention a great soundtrack to boot which helps the watcher really grasp the situations going on in the movie.  ""Spun"" disturbed me, and that's always a great thing; whether it's a tortured stripper or a ""that's gotta hurt!"" gunshot wound, this movie kept me lurching and staring the entire time. It was gritty, realistic, and sick, and that's what made me love it so much.See it for yourself and prepare to be disgusted and amused.  Also, try your best to get the unedited version - though the R version is good enough, it's best to see all the dirt in and of itself.",Spun
140,JewBroadfan05,Welcome to Skiddleyboop!,9,10 March 2005,"I wouldn't call myself a Tweeker ('cause I don't fiend for the drug) but as a dope smoker I really can relate to this movie. I think the casting was wonderful and the story line was great. I personally know what it's like to stay up for days at a time and I can personally relate to Jason's character. I think Britany Murphy did a wonderful job. The cinematography was awesome. But every time they took it up the nose it made me cringe. I think you really have to know about dope to understand the movie or relate to it. All in all it is a great flick so get really spraked and go watch it, if you haven't already (watched the movie that is). Watching this movie is like smoking a shard bowl without even hitting the pipe! Anywho... Skiddleyboop to all!!",Spun
141,myke-15,People looking for a plot are missing the point,10,12 October 2004,"This movie is a realistic portrayal of the meth lifestyle, not because it's a realistic movie, but because it's a bunch of tweakers very busy doing nothing. My friend and I laughed during the whole movie because we both knew people who fit the characters in the film perfectly. If you don't know anyone into drugs this movie probably won't appeal to you. The moviemakers get a lot of facets of the lifestyle spot-on, like the importance of the car. The main character is the most important person in the movie, even more important than the cook, because he's got a car. A lot of the movie is spent driving around on various crank-related missions, most of them pointless. And that's really what being a crankster is about, getting high for the sake of getting high and finding ways to fill all that extra time they now have. If the characters come off as blunted and one-dimensional it's because that's how the people they're portraying are.",Spun

I know it served a purpose, but ya'll coulda checked the volume a bit, geez, i was sitting there laughing my ass off and BOOM!!! The whole neighborhood is awake. Back to the characters, though...... if i could get a couple of people to sit down long enough to watch this, i swear they would see themselves and go into rehab. You got all the craziness down to a tee, the confusion and the way the stuff just sucks up your whole life and leaves ya caring about nothing else....... but you did it in a way that it didn't come off like a drug abuse film at the Health Department....... loved the humor.",Spun

There isn't a redeemable feature about it.All the characters are ultra-punchable, just hideous horrible people. The risible MTV Music video aesthetic got tired about 6 years ago, and this is a film without anything approaching substance to back up this visual assault. I won't even get into the film's pretty disturbing treatment of women. Nothing's more pathetic than a film that tries to shock just for the sake of it- that seems to be this film's motto.There isn't a shred of intelligence or integrity to be found.I've never written a review on here before but I had to do my bit to try and lower the rating.Avoid.",Spun
144,jenbobo2004,"Depressing, but good",7,19 February 2005,"I just finished watching this movie and found it very depressing, but that is because I could see how the characters were destroying their lives. I know it was supposed to be humorous as well, and there were funny parts, but mostly it was just sad. I work with this segment of the population frequently and see what they do to themselves and others. This movie will stay with me for awhile. I have seen the plot described as thin and the movie labeled as a rip off of ""Requiem for a Dream."" Having not seen the other movie, I cannot comment on that. As far as the plot being thin, the movie isn't plot driven, it's more of a character study of the effect of drug addiction on these people. I'm not a film student, I'm not going to comment on the shots. If people enjoy this movie because they think it glamorizes drugs, then they're not getting the point of the movie. I don't think I would want to see it again, but I would recommend it to others. But only if you were in the mood for a dark movie.",Spun

The acting of Rourke lifts the movie to a little bit ""higher"" level! This movie is absolute a must have for your ""dope-movie"" collection. There are several realistic parts in this movie. i guess the risk that things will go wrong when producing this synthetic drug is very high, as shown in the movie. For the future i hope there will be a lot more films like this one. Rourke, i love to see you play! Therefore i would like to advise you to see the movie more then one time, because it deserves the chance!",Spun

147,gamoreno-1,rip-off of requiem,6,4 August 2005,"While Spun was a good movie with decent acting ultimately it was a lesser version of Requiem for a Dream. Requiem came out 2 years earlier and multiple cinematic images and ideas were stolen. The montage of the eye dilating was directly take from Requiem. Also, in the end when all of the characters are finally sleeping the only difference from Requiem was that the characters in Requiem curled up in the fetal position. Despite these blatant rip- offs of a superior movie, I was happy with Schwartzmanns performance and thoroughly entertained and the integration of animation was pretty clever and well done. I suppose I would recommend renting this movie if you really like the actors or you can't find Requiem for a dream. You probably shouldn't buy this movie, Requiem was the original and had a considerably better musical score.",Spun
148,briankeller,SPUN should have been written by someone who knows what that word means.,2,9 September 2005,"I am not proud to say that I have a unique perspective on this subject. When I first rented SPUN I knew that it would either be terrible (written by someone who read about speed in a book), or a really great movie about the most evil substance ever cooked up by man. I'm sorry to say that SPUN was a joke. First of all, this movie is less realistic than Half Baked, and far more annoying than entertaining. John Leguizamo never fails to miss the point completely; honestly this movie should have been made by people who KNOW what SPUN is about. If this movie had been realistic at all, it would have been disturbing instead of goofy, and would have made for a better anti-Meth movie than this circus misinformed actors. Mickey Rourke who plays ""the cook"" was the only staple of strong acting in the movie, he is the one exception to my circus comment. Truly a bad movie; if you are entertained by it, good. But just understand that this is not a realistic movie about Meth. Its too bad that the name SPUN went to waste on such a cheezy, unintelligent movie as this. SPUN was one hell of a come-down, don't expect an intellectually stimulating exploration into world of people who trade food, sleep, and sanity, to be SPUN for as long as they can hold it together. (1 last thing, the song, Number of the Beast, which is played throughout the film, might be one of the best songs about Meth I've ever heard. You can feel the hopeless despair through the lyrics, too bad the movie missed it.)",Spun
149,pjblake81,An amazingly entertaining film with great characters and a soundtrack for the ages,10,5 January 2006,"Spun is one of the most provocative and emotionally charged movies i can recall seeing. The characterization by dialog and artifact is amazing. You gain insight into each one of the characters with very delicate care. Never is to much or too little information provided. Very often in movies of this nature, i.e. movies containing sex, violence, profanity, and drug use, characters and plot lines are left under-developed and shallow. I can with no hesitation tell you that this is not the case in spun. It is as much a character study on a young man trying to cope with everyday stresses while simultaneously battling a drug addiction. This film is often hilarious and extremely entertaining. To put the icing on the cake, the soundtrack is almost unbeatable.",Spun
150,BurnYourEgo,Complete Waste of Time,1,4 September 2006,"Over edited, over acted, terrible camp value. If you want a stylized drug film Transpotting is an excellent choice, if you want gritty go for Panic in Needle Park. This is the Go of the drug film genre; all style no substance. I can't believe a film about meth had a 101 minute runtime. I'm just glad Rourke and Murphy were able to redeem themselves with Sin City where ham lines and overacting were part of the style and added to the comic book aspect of the film. Spun was full of stereotypes and generic characters that lacked any depth. Even as a parody of the meth lifestyle or drug films in general this movie just did not work by any means. I wish I could pour bleach in my DVD player to cleanse it of this tripe.",Spun
