0,TheLittleSongbird,"Excellent movie, if very disturbing at times.",8,16 July 2009,"Mississippi Burning is a very good movie, with its focus of racism, a very sensitive subject, in the Civil Rights Movement cleverly handled. I will say, some scenes because the violence was very intense to the maximum, were rather upsetting to watch, like any scene when someone was attacked, the nature of the violence was very upsetting. The gunshot at the beginning was unbelievably loud, and made me jump quite violently. However, it is a very powerful and tense film, helped by a well-written script and an atmospheric music score. The dark brooding cinematography helped considerably to the film's proceedings, and the performances were excellent, with Gene Hackman mesmerising in the lead, and Willem Dafoe perfectly matching him. The story is a powerful one, and rarely slips in tension. Overall, a very tense and powerful film, long and quite violent, but a very good film, all the same. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Mississippi Burning
1,bkoganbing,It helps to be wise in the ways and mores of Dixie,9,26 March 2013,"It's now a well documented fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was convinced that the Civil Rights movement was somehow being directed from Moscow as part of the Communist conspiracy. As if anyone's struggle for equality needed outside direction. Hoover's bugging of Martin Luther King is legendary both for its lack of useful information to prove that thesis and for the titillation that King's indiscretions provided for certain people in power courtesy of J. Edgar.But when the murders of those two outside civil rights workers from New York City Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman happened the nation was shocked. First it was a missing persons case, then a homicide when the bodies were discovered. Public opinion forced the FBI and its director to take this seriously. And I have to say that when they did, the job was done.The names of the civil rights workers were not mentioned nor was the name of the young black kid who here was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life James Morton was a voter registrar working with Goodman and Schwerner. That gave some dramatic license to the producers of Mississippi Burning to spin their own version of events. Given the redneck wall of silence that federal investigators had to deal with I'm not sure the spinning was too far from the truth.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of a button down FBI agent of the Hoover era rings real true. Hoover's own standards regarding appearance and behavior of his agents somewhat hampered law enforcement in certain fields. He had other foibles that have come down to us since his death in 1972, some real, some speculative. Dafoe just isn't getting the job done.Which brings us to Gene Hackman who is a former Mississippi sheriff and wise in the ways and mores of Dixie. When Dafoe gives him a free hand Hackman gets results even though like in real life these Ku Klux Klansmen could only be tried in federal court as no Mississippi state jury would have convicted these creatures. Hackman got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance. And it's a good thing that the ACLU wasn't looking to hard at Hackman's methods. It was like what Sean Connery taught Kevin Costner about bringing down Al Capone in The Untouchables. It probably did take the FBI bending Hoover's precious rules to get justice in real life. Frances McDormand plays a truly sad role as the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies who was in on the killing. She's a caring and compassionate woman and indiscreet about her husband's activities. She pays for that. It is restrained, understated, but very powerful performance that netted her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.Mississippi Burning won for Best Cinematography and got a number of other nominations including Best Picture. Sad to say it was up against Rain Man that year and I'd hate to split the difference between what Hackman and what Dustin Hoffman did in his classic.It's ironic that I saw this film and between seeing it and writing about it I attended one of many marriage equality rallies throughout the nation as the Supreme Court hears arguments about same sex marriage. The same people who could not comprehend the mixing of races are in the forefront of a fight against marriage equality because their minds can't comprehend that either. A seismic cultural shift against racial segregation took place just as a seismic cultural shift is occurring now toward the acceptance of the LGBT lives and lifestyles. It's been a privilege to live in these interesting times.Mississippi Burning with a bit of literary license remains a fine dramatic film and should be required viewing for those who want to study those times and get an idea what the civil rights struggle was about. Books will not give you as good an idea as Mississippi Burning will.",Mississippi Burning
2,Leofwine_draca,Harrowing account of America's racial history,10,14 November 2011,"An excellent exploration of the civil rights problems affecting America during the 1960s. The reason MISSISSIPPI BURNING is so profound is that it takes a matter of fact, middle of the road approach, refusing to judge its cast of diverse characters and instead portraying the events as is, without bias. The film presents two actors at the top of their game – Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe – playing a couple of FBI agents who visit a small town to investigate some racist murders.Alan Parker fills this film with a slow burning intensity and anger in much the same way he did in ANGEL HEART. The script is literate and affecting, seeking to get into the minds of men we dismiss as racist and learning what makes them tick. The conspiracy angle is by far the most interesting part of the film and I can't imagine anybody not moved come the events of the climax. Of the supporting cast, there's a stand-out turn from a ruthless Michael Rooker, a very good Brad Dourif as the sly deputy, and an excellent Frances McDormand as a would-be love interest. R. Lee Ermey, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Stephen Tobolowsky all put in compelling turns as various sinister characters and the film's story never flags for a second, making this film the final word regarding its subject matter.",Mississippi Burning
3,SnoopyStyle,Great performances in great movie,9,20 October 2014,"It's 1964 Mississippi. Three young civil rights workers are murdered. The FBI has sent two men to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is straight laced, idealist, 3 years in the bureau, and put in charge of this investigation. Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) is the easy going, jovial veteran with a better sense of the world they're getting into. He used to be a small town sheriff near Memphis. None of the locals are willing to help. Anderson befriends deputy Pell (Brad Dourif)'s wife (Frances McDormand).This is a great historical drama. It's definitely fictionalized which probably irked many people for different reasons. I don't mind the differences in the minutia of history as long as the feeling of realism is maintained. That is well achieved in this movie. The best have to be the two great performances of two great actors. They are perfection.",Mississippi Burning
4,kosmasp,Still on going process,9,14 February 2021,"And that is not just the theme of the movie but me trying to get a review for this movie out. Now I did not really change much in my previous efforts to get my review actually published/approved, I did change my summary line but left most of the review itself like it was. As you can tell this has changed with this incarnation, inlcuding another ""Summary line"" that sums things up (I know ""duh"").Having said all that, the movie touches on a very sensitive subject matter and I reckon February being Black History month is as good as any other month to watch this and realize certain issues America had and is still facing for a multiple of reasons. It also shows that even when you know a culprit, someone who is likely to do something again if he gets the chance, no matter how wrong it is what he did and is still likely to do .. there has to be checks and balances. And while you may think (rightfully?) that I'm talking abot current events, I do (also) mean the happenings in this movie.The pairing of Gene Hackman (more in tune of what is going because he lived certain things, flawed in his approaches as much as his partner here though) and Willem Dafoe is an amazing one. They both fight for what is right ... but as you may know, being right does not always result in you ... being right ... I don't think I have to explain that and sorry for the pun.I thin a few things are predictable here to say the least, but with great actors, like the ones already mentioned and Frances McDormand who might have her very first appearance on Film here (I didn't check, but someone suggested exactly that) to name one more ... a tough but essential viewing not just for those who are into Dramas ... might make a great double bill with In the Heat of the Night, which I also have to rewatch asap",Mississippi Burning
5,lee_eisenberg,it didn't really happen like this,7,29 July 2005,"The recent belated conviction of Edgar Ray Killen (wouldn't you say that it's appropriate that he has ""kill"" in his last name?) brings to mind the story that inspired ""Mississippi Burning"". It's the story of how a group of Ku Klux Klan members murdered civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the summer of 1964. The movie portrays the murders, but FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are made up. It turns out that the FBI bribed one of the murderers to rat on the other two, and all the while the FBI was tapping Schwerner's father's phone to see if he was a Communist.So, they played with the facts. Hollywood often does that. Either way, ""Mississippi Burning"" still is a good movie, reminding us of a time in our country's history when we were about to explode.",Mississippi Burning
6,jboothmillard,Mississippi Burning,8,13 July 2009,"From the first opening scene I could tell this film, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Angel Heart), was going to be controversial with issues of racism, so I was definitely going to stick with it. Based loosely on truth, set in the 1960's, FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are called to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance, obviously murder, of three civil rights workers, one being black, carried out by members of the Ku Klux Klan. The whole town is divided by the white and coloured, so racism is all around, and of course there are many whites who are secretly members of the KKK, helping bring brutality and to burn down black peoples' homes, crosses and churches. Of course this is set during the time of the civil rights movement, so all the people involved in these heinous crimes are caught and punished. Also starring Oscar nominated Frances McDormand as Mrs. Pell, Brad Dourif as Deputy Clinton Pell, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman, Gailard Sartain as Sheriff Ray Stuckey, Heroes' Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley, Michael Rooker as Frank Bailey, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Lester Cowans, Badja Djola as Agent Monk, Kevin Dunn as Agent Bird and Saw's Tobin Bell as Agent Stokes. The performances are fantastic, the story is very gripping, and with all the controversy and violence you really understand how terrible this time was. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Original Film Score for Trevor Jones, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Gene Hackman was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Mississippi Burning
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Great Acting, But Overdone Stereotypes & Bias",5,29 October 2006,"This was a very intense story about three missing civil rights workers in 1964 and the U.S. government looking into that disappearance (and murder) in Mississippi, where it happened.On first viewing, I really enjoyed this because of the top-rated performance by the lead actors Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe and the fact that the story was interesting. However, on subsequent viewings, the ultra-Liberal bias of the people making this movie became more and more evident. Typical of Liberal elitists, they make every Southerner in this film (but one) look like very stupid, extremely racist hicks - the kind of people who want to strangle yourself.Hey, no one argues that racism is bad, bad thing but this goes to ridiculous extremes while giving cheap shots to Christians, as well. That's another typical feature of liberal bias. They have no problem showing us those slimeballs who are anti-Semitic, as also portrayed here, but at the same time the people who make the films can't hide their own anti-Christian bias.Too bad because Hackman and Dafoe are superb and the story moves very well. It's a fast two hours of film ""entertainment."" Note: beware the language is very rough with way too many usages of the Lord's name in vain.",Mississippi Burning
8,rmax304823,"Nice drama, conjectural history.",7,13 April 2007,"Willem DaFoe is a by-the-book FBI investigator and is assisted by ex-Southern-sheriff Gene Hackman in the real-life inquiry into the deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964. The three kids disappeared. No one, black or white, is willing to cooperate with the ""Hoover boys"" that poke around in the small town's business. The blacks won't cooperate because they're afraid, the whites for more obvious reasons. And some less obvious ones. As the clued-in Hackman puts it, ""They have to live here long after we're packed up and gone."" Just about every character is a stereotype that's played out like a card in a hand of bridge. The head of the local Ku Klux Klan, who calls himself ""a local businessman"" is a balding nincompoop who hates not just blacks but Papists and Jews and probably Brobdignagians. He doesn't have a family. Not even a dog or a cat as far as we can tell. The other heavies, including the prototypical redneck Michael Rooker with his frozen sneer, don't have families either, except for Deputy Brad Dourif, who has a wife. But he only has a wife so that the movie can show us that not all Southern whites are murdering racists. Some are sweet and lovable and attractive, in the way that Carol Burnett is attractive, and, as just about sublimely played by Frances McDormand, are so haunted by distaste for these illegal caste-ridden shenanigans that she's able and willing to squeal to Gene Hackman's FBI agent about the murders. That indiscretion gets her clobbered.The performances are all good and some are splendid. Hackman could not be better. Every move he makes, every line of dialog, carries weight. DaFoe's character is less colorfully delineated. McDormand is outstanding, and so are Rooker, Dourif, and the guy who plays the KKK head. (What a trio of villains.) The tobacco-chewing Sheriff is great in a small supporting role.When the FBI is stretched to its official limits without results, Hackman is given license to use his own methods. Enter two unofficial FBI heavies. One is a balding red-head with bulging eyes who has since made a career out of playing serial murderers. The other is a huge black guy with an ominous and resonant baritone who threatens to castrate the Mayor unless he spills the beans, which the Mayor does, leading to almost all the desired convictions.The direction is tasteful. When the decomposing corpses are uncovered, it's in long shot. When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand, we only get a few introductory blows before the cut, just so we know what's going to happen next.Location shooting is evocative. It's a convincing small Southern town shimmering in the summer heat. Most ""Southern"" scene -- the silent guy on the Choctaw reservations who is carving up catfish. The characters, although they may as well carry sandwich boards advertising their function in the script, are pretty well drawn.If there's a problem with the film it's that it is laid out like a dramatic movie in the usual form of rising climaxes. The payoffs towards the end simply don't fit in with the otherwise realistic depiction of events. I did not for a moment believe that undercover FBI agents were brought in to kidnap the Mayor and threaten to cut off his family jewels. That belongs to a movie script, or to some black hole of a CIA prison in Bulgaria, not to a narrative that purports to be based on an historic event.The final impression the film leaves you with is how surprisingly easy it is for a deeply felt and thoroughly entrenched set of values to change so quickly. A generation has passed, only a generation, since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed, ""Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever."" The situation displayed here, in 1964, isn't perfect now. Nothing is perfect. But it's a hell of a lot better than it was then. This is actually a curiously mixed blessing. It leaves Southern white people with still another defeat that they must get over. And it leaves blacks with a great deal of anti-white resentment that has no place to go.",Mississippi Burning
9,Tweekums,Hatred in the Deep South,9,5 November 2018,"Inspired by real events this film opens with the murder of three civil rights activists, two white one black, in Mississippi in 1964. When they are reported missing two very different FBI agents are sent to investigate. Rupert Anderson, is a former Mississippi sheriff who doesn't always play by the rules and Alan Ward is a by-the-book high-flier but both are determined to bring those responsible to justice. They won't get much help locally; the police are indifferent at best, complicit at worst and nobody is going to talk because they know what will happen if they are even suspected of talking to the FBI. Soon Ward calls in more personnel and tensions rise even further as local racists try to intimidate the black population. It soon becomes obvious that if the FBI are to get anywhere they will have to break a few rules.Some may have problems by the fact that this is inspired by real murders but then gives a fictionalised investigation... that wasn't a problem for me though. The story presented shines a light on sinister events and attitudes that are far from being ancient history. The overt racism portrayed is disturbing; it isn't just the killers and Klansman who have such attitudes. While the identity of the killers isn't in doubt just how they will be brought to justice is. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as Agent Rupert Anderson; Willem Dafoe is solid as Agent Alan Ward and Frances McDormand impresses as Mrs Pell, wife of a deputy involved in the case. The rest of the cast impress too; they make some very unpleasant characters believable. Overall I'd definitely say this is worth watching; it has an important message but also proves to be a gripping thriller.",Mississippi Burning

Then our starring Gene Hackman has to use other methods by attempting to find out what really happened to the young men .1964.

11,moonspinner55,"""What has four eyes but still can't see?""",6,14 September 2009,"Sledgehammer-styled redemption over racial injustice and bigotry. Alan Parker directs this fictionalization of a true-life chapter in which determined F.B.I. men took on the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 after three Civil Rights workers disappeared while driving through a small redneck town in Mississippi. Parker puts the squeeze on us right from the start, omitting few horrors, eventually equating a quest for truth and justice to a violent surge of tables-turning vigilantism (as if there was no other way to succeed here). Since the lawmen in Jessup County have blood on their hands, and the black folks are too scared to speak for fear of retaliation by the whites, the F.B.I. choose to play hardball (impersonating hooded Klansman and taking on the sect's weakest members--even threatening to castrate the mayor!). This third-act revolution certainly gets the audience's blood pumping, while Trevor Jones' score sees to it that we're pounded over the head with suspenseful anticipation. But what happened to the Civil Rights Movement within the movie's time-frame? Surely it didn't disintegrate while this investigation went on? Parker scuttles it for the sake of good old melodrama. In the end, his film is just a well-made racial potboiler, though Gene Hackman's work as underling to Special Agent Willem Dafoe is top-notch (it is perhaps one of Hackman's best performances). Supporting cast also strong, and technically the picture is a superior piece of goods, but it won't be anyone's favorite movie. The spectrum here is narrow, and the statistics at the finale, rushed along, have no dramatic impact whatsoever. **1/2 from ****",Mississippi Burning
12,edwagreen,Mississippi Burning-We're On Forever Fire With this One ****,10,27 April 2009,"Outstanding film dealing with the murder of 3 civil rights workers during the fiery civil rights struggle of the 1960s.Gene Hackman is absolutely marvelous as a southern FBI agent attempting to track down the cowardly killers in this absolute thriller of a motion picture. He receives fine support from Willem Dafoe. The latter plays a northern FBI agent in conflict with Hackman as no matter what the FBI attempts to do, they are thwarted every step of the way by a bigoted, disgusting town and local law enforcement officers up to their necks in corruption and murder.As the wife of a deputy sheriff, Frances McDormand is fabulous as an abused woman with a conscience.The film is terrific as it shows how the bigots attempt to justify their ways as appropriate to their religion. They can cite phrases justifying the segregation system.It was only after the FBI began to play hardball with this hoodlum element that something was able to be done.",Mississippi Burning
13,Coventry,Something's burning in Mississippi  and I think it's hatred!,8,19 September 2016,"Recently, with my wife, I watched the 2011 film ""The Help"" which is a truly brilliant movie that I can only recommend wholeheartedly. That same movie also sparked my desire to dig up some other terrific films about civil rights, and then it doesn't take too long before you end up at Alan Parker's ""Mississippi Burning"". Although nearly 30 years old now, this is still an immensely powerful and often shocking tale inspired by the real-life murders of 3 young activists by members of the Ku Klux Klan in a small Mississippian county in the spring of 1964. I'm European and there isn't too much known around here regarding the facts of this case, but I can easily imagine that turning this true crime case into a fairly large-scaled film production much have caused quite a bit of amok and controversy even 24 years later. Still, even though the references towards the so-called 'Mississippi civil right workers' murders' case are unmistakable, director Alan Parker primarily approaches the events from a more objective viewpoint by focusing on the FBI investigation. As the sudden disappearance of the 3 youngsters in rural Mississippi is considered alarming (perhaps because 2 of them are Caucasian), the FBI sends two agents over to the Magnolia State. Alan Ward is a young graduate and ambitious city agent who strictly follows the protocol, whereas Rupert Anderson is a former Mississippi small county sheriff himself and uses more unorthodox methods to find out the things he want. Needless to say their styles and personalities often clash, but it's Anderson who makes the most progress in the case, especially when he develops a tender – almost poetic, in fact – relationship with the wife of the sadist deputy (and KKK-member) Clinton Pell. Admittedly, you could blame director Alan Parker and scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo their excessive overuse of stereotypes All the FBI folks (except for Anderson) are uptight desk clerks with fancy suits, all the black people are mute victims, the women are docile and petrified wives and all the racist rednecks are ignorant and violent scumbags. Of course, just because the stereotypes are such opposites, the confrontations between them are extremely intense and atmospheric. The suspense literally mounts when the rednecks are relentlessly chasing an innocent black guy, or when Agent Anderson nonchalantly walks into the unofficial KKK clubhouse. Another reason why I personally don't mind the use of stereotypes is because it gives the fantastic cast the opportunity to showcase their talents. Awesomely talented guys like Michael Rooker, Brad Dourif and Pruit Taylor Vince are truly brilliant in depicting their vile and loathsome Southern redneck characters. But the greatest performance undeniably comes from Gene Hackman, as he almost naturally shapeshifts between hard-boiled law enforcer and tenderly comprehensive gentleman during his sequences with Frances McDormand. Another umpteenth brilliant performance from one of the greatest actors of the 70s, 80s and 90s.",Mississippi Burning

15,hitchcockthelegend,What is wrong with these people?,8,28 February 2009,"James Chaney, Andy Goodman and Mickey Schwener were murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan in Neshoba County, Mississippi 1964. Their disappearance and subsequent murder sparked off one of the biggest FBI manhunts in history, and led to the conviction of several high profile Klan members.This is an interpretation of those events...Make no bones about it, Mississippi Burning is an emotionally sapping piece of film, the vile and despicable theme at its core should sicken anyone with an ounce of decency in their respective make up. What stops the film being the masterpiece of importance it should have been, is that director Alan Parker gives way to over fictionalising the already harsh facts of the case. In the process, choosing to stereotype both parties and sidestepping equality issues in favour of an FBI uneasy alliance, and a god forsaken romantic sub-plot! It's such a shame that Parker and his backers obviously lost sight of the reason they picked the project to film in the first place.So what are we left with? Well it's still one hell of a film for sure. The harshness and emotional impact is evident as the story unfolds, the troubled South vividly brought to life in a sea of burning crosses and segregated restaurants, with Peter Biziou's Academy Award winning cinematography an essential extra character in the piece. The cast is almost to die for, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe take the lead roles as our feuding, at odds, FBI investigators, Popeye Doyle meets Sgt Elias anyone? But its with the supporting cast that Mississippi Burning becomes an essential watch for fans of actors. Rolling off the tongue like a who's who of weasel character actors is Michael Rooker, Brad Douriff, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, with FBI support coming from Tobin Bell and Kevin Dunn. Frances McDormand does fine with a caricature written part, whilst fans of Biloxi Blues {me} will delight in seeing the wonderfully named Park Overall laying on her hussy act in the beauty salon.At times shattering, at others frustrating, Mississippi Burning sadly only scratches the surface of the topic to hand, but for sure the movie world is all the more better for films like this, so in that it becomes an essential watch, so see it if you haven't already. 8/10",Mississippi Burning
16,Theo Robertson,The Irony Is That Everything Is Black And White,6,20 July 2009,"This is based upon the true story of the FBI investigating the murders of three civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi in 1964 . I haven't bothered to look up the intricacies of the true life but I feel I should have used the phrase "" based very loosely upon the true story "" in my opening line . There's a problem throughout the film in that if a character is : White male = Inbred , violent redneck scumbag who's convinced there's a Zionist plot going on involving blacks White female = Somewhat slutty . Might help the FBI if it involves breaking her wedding vows Black = Regardless whether they're male , female or child they're incapable of helping themselves . Eternal victims Even the FBI "" heroes "" played by Hackman and Defoe are impossible to warm to . There's also too much emphasise on "" Listen you do it my way or not at all "" type arguments . I'm sort of guessing that the production wants to see an element of dubious morality brought in to the charaterisation but everything is so ridiculously overdone it's impossible to connect with any of the characters even though it's intensely acted by the cast",Mississippi Burning
17,preppy-3,Powerful but not as moving as it should be,8,30 August 2009,"Based on a true story. In 1964 Mississippi three civil right workers (2 whites, 1 black) disappear without a trace. FBI agents come to investigate--southern Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and straight-laced by the book Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson knows the south and the racism and believes in fighting dirty. Ward wants to go by the book and is a calm influence. They soon realize that the workers may be dead--and the town is covering it up.This received tons of negative publicity when it came out. It was based on a real life case and people said this movie distorted the facts or told outright lies. People don't seem to realize this is a FICTIONAL movie! It's not a documentary and doesn't pretend to be. It just uses the case as a starting point to show the ugly racism and hatred back then in Mississippi. It's VERY well made but somewhat disturbing to watch. There's plenty of swearing and a certain ""n"" word is used constantly.It's an important movie...but it never connected with me emotionally. I WAS horrified to see what went on then and LOVED seeing the white guys getting it at the end...but I found it simplistic. All the white guys (save FBI agents) are ignorant vicious southerners who HATE blacks. All the black people just sit back and take all the violence directed at them without even attempting to fight back. How about all those freedom marches that happened back then? The clashes between black and white? They never happened? Turning the whites into monsters and all the blacks into victims was not the way to go. It distorts what the civil rights movement was like. I was always kept at a distance. The violence was strong and horrific (as it should be) but it never moved me. Still this is worth catching. Hackman is outstanding in his role (and was nominated for an Academy Award) and Frances McDormand is great in her too few scenes. Dafoe is a disappointment. He plays his character TOO straight-laced and unemotional. I got annoyed with him rather than cheering him on. Everybody else does great. This is far from a perfect film but it shows us a somewhat accurate portrayal of 1964. I'm glad this is being shown in high schools and colleges. I give it an 8.",Mississippi Burning

Yes, Hackman and Dafoe are excellent, brilliant even, and yes, the heavies are really heavy probably because they are so insistent that he is NOT my brother but floating blissfully above all of this is MacDormand's butterfly hovering above the bloody battlefield unseen, neglected, until she opens her mouth and triggers a beating from a slightly-built husband who metamorphoses into Stanley Kowalski in a heartbeat.

20,Boba_Fett1138,Not the powerful movie I expected it to be but it remains a well made movie.,7,11 July 2009,"Even though ""Mississippi Burning"" is far from a failure, the movie still give me the feeling as if it could had been much better and far more effective with its subject, had it picked a bit of a different approach at times.""Mississippi Burning"" is a pure film-makers movie, that relies heavily on the skills of its cast & crew. Due to this however the movie looses its focus at times, when its story starts to more rely on some biased stereotypes and clichés, which makes the story at times rather unlikely, instead of powerful and effective. Perhaps the story should had put more its emphasis on its two main characters, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman and their relationship as FBI-partners, who both have different ideas and styles of approaches.The whole racial theme serves as the basis for the movie its story. It's however not really a story that grabs me and draws me into it, even though the subject itself is to me always interesting and potentially gripping and extremely powerful. ""A Time to Kill"" is for instance a movie who tackled this subject much better, in my opinion.It's not like the cast & crew didn't gave their very best though. Alan Paker provided the movie with his experienced directing abilities, though its a bit uneven at times with its themes and approaches, like often is the case with most of his movies. He doesn't always seem to be able to put its emphasis on one main thing.The movie knows to capture the right atmosphere for a movie with such a theme like this one has. It means that the movie has some effective cinematography and picked some good settings.The movie has a bit of a surprising cast, with for instance Willem Dafoe in a quite big role opposite Gene Hackman. Perhaps Dafoe gives away one of his best performances in this movie and he allowed himself to go through a metamorphose, physically and acting-wise. Giving Gene Hackman a cop-role is always a good idea. It always sort of reminds you of his ""The French Connection"" performance. The movie also stars a well cast R. Lee Ermey, who had just won an Oscar for his ""Full Metal Jacket"" role and Michael Rooker. It also stars some good actors, who were still quite unknown at the time of this movie, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Tobin Bell.It's a good and well made movie that could had been a more powerful one if it had put its emphasis at different things at times. The movie now sometimes looses its focus, not making this the movie that it potentially could had become.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Mississippi Burning
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Chilling,8,6 December 2009,"Why had I not heard of this before? I purchased a copy of this on sale on a hunch, and boy am I glad I did. This deals with the issue of racism in a respectful and honest way, not shying away from the disgusting and awful things done in the name of ""keeping white men pure"", and yet without ever preaching. When three Civil Rights activists disappear in Mississippi, two FBI agents are sent in to solve the case. But how can they do so, when the bigotry is so rampant? This was based upon real events, though the facts were changed... some say ""too much"", and that has led to controversy surrounding the release. The portrayal of the deep South is deeply unpleasant, and one can only hope that they are nothing like the way they were in the 60's anymore. This is gripping from start to finish, exciting and also funny. The humor doesn't try hard, and all feels very natural. This is well-paced. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. All roles are well-cast, and Hackman, Dafoe and Tobolowsky, among others, shine. The dialog is impeccably written and delivered, with countless memorable and quote-worthy lines. This is well-produced, with great editing and cinematography. Parker is known to be a dependable director, and he does not disappoint. The DVD has an interesting commentary by him, as well as a trailer. There is brutal violence, relatively frequent moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this.

22,view_and_review,Good but hard to watch,7,13 August 2018,"On June 21, 1964 three young men drove a CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) station wagon from Meridian to Longview, Mississippi. On the return trip to Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price arrested them for speeding. He jailed them in Philadelphia, MS. then finally released them a little after 10 p.m. and told them to leave town. A few miles outside of Philadelphia the deputy stopped their car again--this time after a wild chase--and turned them over to a group of Neshoba County Klansmen. Their bodies wouldn't be found until over a month later by FBI agents.That's the real story. Mississippi Burning is a close dramatization of it.I watched in both disgust and surprise. I was disgusted by the actions of the proud citizens of Mississippi and I was surprised to see actors that I new nothing about when the movie came out in 1989--the likes of Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand (Three Billboards...), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket), Michael Rooker (Merle from The Walking Dead), Frankie Faison (commissioner on The Wire), and Darius McCrary (Eddie Winslow on Family Matters). I was surprised, not in a bad way, but in a ""Whoa! He's in this?!"" way. Sure these names aren't A-listers but they are all familiar faces to me that I never knew culminated on a 1989 project.As for the movie itself, there was some creative license taken but it was very close to the real events. In fact, the FBI knew so much about the murders because one of their informants was with the guilty party. The movie does evoke strong feelings and it is unavoidable. How do you depict 1960's deep south without raising the hairs on the back of someone's neck? Because this movie wasn't a through-and-through tragedy there was a modicum of justice served.

This sweaty tale of the FBI taking on the Ku Klux Klan in Civil Rights-era Mississippi has taken on renewed relevance in today's world, given the ugly, hateful faction of Americans who our current President has encouraged to crawl out from beneath their slimy rocks. This is no liberal feel-good version of the fight against racism and bigotry, in which a call for mutual understanding wins the day. No, in this film, the only way to beat ugliness is to be yet uglier. There was a time when this movie would have left a bad taste in my mouth, but in the light of recent current events, I received a tremendous amount of cathartic satisfaction in watching Gene Hackman beat up a bunch of worthless white trash.

One of them (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book while the other (Gene Hackman) mingles with the people to sniff out the culprits. Their vastly different approaches create tension, but they both have their strengths and weaknesses.This is just a great film about the injustice of one group of smallminded people wanting to suppress another and those who seek a more perfect world.Hackman stands out as the main protagonist, but Dafoe is good as well. Brad Dourif and Frances McDormand play the couple that the Hackman character zeroes in on. He knows the husband is guilty and his wife is the weak link because (1.) she's also oppressed and unhappy, (2.) she sees the injustice going on and doesn't like it, but knows there's realistically little she can do to stop it without incurring the wrath of her husband & his colleagues, and (3.) she enjoys the agent's flirtations and he senses it.The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in the heart of Mississippi.GRADE: A+",Mississippi Burning
25,The_Void,Excellent thriller with a profound message,8,28 March 2005,"Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a surprisingly good police thriller that mixes the intrigue and mystery of a police investigation with a commentary on American culture in the 1960's, and said people's attitudes towards racism. It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across.The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating. Still, this is a very good movie and one I don't hesitate to recommend!",Mississippi Burning
26,Mr-Fusion,"Powerful stuff, but bring an iron stomach",8,14 September 2014,"I have no idea how accurate MISSISSIPPI BURNING is, and I imagine a lot was changed for the purposes of making a movie. But geez, what a story. And make no mistake; it is rough going. There's all sorts of backwards sentiment to make you sick. The movie's got hate oozing through the seams. Most of it's revolting, sometimes horrifying. But as a gripping thriller, it is top-notch. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the shining stars of this whole thing as two cops clashing over different styles of handling the same case. Two amazing performances, and these guys work well off of each other. But there's great work from Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker and R. Lee Ermey (Dourif and Rooker, especially, who embody such hateful scum beyond belief). It's a great piece of drama, but also one that bluntly shows a different world in the south. And that world's not easy to stick around in. There is justice in the end, but just knowing that the good guys had to get their hands dirty to effect it leaves you all the more conflicted, just as it does our hero FBI agents. But when all is said and done, even if the movie's subject matter is hard to swallow, MISSISSIPI BURNING is wholeheartedly, without a shadow of a doubt worth watching for Gene Hackman. The man is at his peak in this movie, and his fluid transition from charming to outright menacing can be witnessed in the bar scene. Mesmerizing stuff. Hackman's abilities are beyond question. 8/10",Mississippi Burning

28,JamesHitchcock,A Southern Dirty Harry,8,24 July 2009,"There have been a number of films, such as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" and ""A Time to Kill"" which have used the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society, particularly in the Deep South. ""Mississippi Burning"" uses the conventions of another type of crime drama, the ""buddy cop"" movie, in order to examine the same problem. The ""buddy cop"" film was one that was growing in popularity in the eighties; ""Lethal Weapon"", sometimes regarded as the most influential film in the genre, had come out the previous year.The film is set in Mississippi in 1964 and is loosely based on the real-life FBI investigation into the murders of three civil rights workers in that year. It focuses on two fictional FBI agents sent to investigate the murders. As is common with ""buddy"" movies (think of the roles played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"") the two men are very different in character and do not start out as ""buddies"" at all- indeed, they start out by disliking one another. Agent Alan Ward, played by Willem Dafoe, is the younger of the two, although he is ostensibly senior in rank. He is a politically liberal, idealistic northerner who sympathises with the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. He takes a straightforward, ""by the book"" attitude to law enforcement.Agent Rupert Anderson, portrayed by Gene Hackman, is considerably older than Ward and a native Mississippian whose career in law enforcement began as Sheriff of a small town similar to the one in which the murders took place. Although he disagrees with the racist attitudes which prevail in the area, he has a deeper understanding than Ward of race relations in the south and of the motivations of white southerners. He is haunted by memories of the part played by his father, a poor white farmer and bigoted racist, in the persecution of a black neighbour. Whereas Ward is a ""by the book"" liberal, Anderson can be seen as a Southern version of Dirty Harry, or perhaps of Hackman's own ""tough cop"" character, Popeye Doyle. He realises that standard investigation methods are unlikely to produce results, largely because potential witnesses are too terrified to give evidence or even to collaborate with the Bureau. (The killers were all members of the Ku Klux Klan, and the Klan are determined to thwart the investigation through intimidation). Anderson decides to fight fire with fire, resorting to methods that even Harry Callahan might have blanched at, such as threatening to have one suspect castrated. Ward, realising that his own methods have not succeeded, is persuaded to give his blessing to Anderson's approach.Hackman received a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" nomination, as this is one of his best performances. His Anderson is one of the cinema's most memorable ""tough cops"" alongside Clint Eastwood's Callahan and Steve McQueen's Bullitt; deceptively easy-going with a cynical streak of humour, but capable of an icy ruthlessness when needed. Dafoe, rather surprisingly, missed out on an Oscar nomination, but there was one for Frances McDormand as the wife of one of the suspects who agrees to inform on her husband when she begins to suspect that he was involved in the crime. The film itself was nominated for ""Best Picture"", but lost out to that other fine movie ""Rain Man"".As a crime thriller ""Mississippi Burning"" is a very good one; director Alan Parker handles the action well and there is a constant sense of tension, of events moving rapidly and inexorably towards a shattering climax. The film was controversial when it came out in 1988, largely because it was seen as advocating uncompromising and illegal methods of law enforcement. It was also criticised for allegedly portraying black characters as passive victims of violence and for glorifying the FBI's role in the Civil Rights struggle; in reality J. Edgar Hoover had little sympathy with the cause and only got involved reluctantly under pressure from President Johnson.There may be justice in some of these criticisms, but I nevertheless found it a film well worth watching. It was advertised under the slogan ""1964- when America was at war with itself"". This may seem over-dramatic, but there is a sense in which it is true. Civil Rights leaders such as Martin Luther King may have intended their movement to be non-violent, but their opponents had no intention of playing by the same rules. ""Mississippi Burning"" is a film that asks similar questions about the philosophy of law enforcement to those raised by ""Dirty Harry"" . We may be uncomfortable with the methods of a Rupert Anderson- but part of our discomfort is the realisation that the such methods may have been necessary to break the power which the Klan held over much of the South. 8/10",Mississippi Burning

30,Smells_Like_Cheese,It broke my heart,9,31 December 2005,"Not saying this isn't an excellent film, it is just bluntly honest. I remember in English class in high school, we were learning about racism in the 60's, and how horrible it was. The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film. Being one voice sometimes can either be helpful or get you into a lot of trouble.I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of. Now, I am out on my own, and I had the chance to see the movie once again, and felt that I could see it. It's a terrific and very powerful movie that can get anyone to cry unbearably. It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.I honestly feel that everyone should see this movie, it can change your life or make you look around and want to change things. I know this comment feels more like a lecture than a comment, but that's how much this movie got to me. I think we all can do something right in this world, it's just a matter or standing up.

31,sddavis63,Sometimes It Makes You Mad; Sometimes You Just Want To Cry,8,25 February 2015,"It's rare that you find a movie with so many sobering moments that stay with you when the movie's finished, but Mississippi Burning is full of those moments. Some are just sobering - like the shot of the two water fountains, one brand spanking new, marked ""Whites"" and one old and run down, marked ""Coloreds."" Some scenes are unsettling, with overly racist and obnoxious things being said - ""niggers don't even take baths and they stink!"" Some scenes are frightening - little children laughing and applauding along with their parents at Ku Klux Klan rallies. Then there's the violence - lynchings and beatings and murders of local blacks. This isn't a movie for the feint of heart. It isn't a ""pleasant"" movie at all, but it's certainly a powerful one.It's loosely based on the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and it revolves around the two FBI agents leading the investigation - Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Andersen (Gene Hackman). This was a powerful performance from both men. Hackman I expected that from, because I consistently like Gene Hackman's work, and he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Dafoe I have had mixed reactions to over the years, but he was very good in this. Ward and Andersen are both FBI agents, but very different in their approach. Ward is a Northerner, and wants to do things by the book. Andersen is a southerner who knows that ""by the book"" won't cut it when dealing with racists and the Klan. Watching them work out their relationship is interesting.There's a large number of secondary characters, all of whom have significant roles to play in the unfolding of the story. The most important of them is probably ""Mrs. Pell"" (played by Frances McDormand, who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) - the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies implicated in the murders. Her Oscar nomination aside, I admit that I wasn't really taken with the character of Mrs. Pell and the implication of some type of friendship or relationship brewing with Andersen, although the scene in which her husband deals with his ""problem at home"" (as one of his good ole boy buddies called her) is brutal, and another of those scenes that stays with you.The name of the movie refers to the name of the FBI investigation, although it's put to good use as there are repeated scenes throughout the movie of the burning of black churches and homes, with a few burning crosses thrown in as well. It is unsettling and at times unpleasant to watch, but it's also very good. (8/10)",Mississippi Burning
32,ElMaruecan82,Hatred isn't something you're born with ...,10,22 July 2011,"Based on the true story of three civil rights workers' murders, Alan Parker's ""Mississippi Burning"" is a fictionalized dramatization of the investigation, conducted by two opposite FBI agents, both remarkably played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman.Defoe is the young Ward, a bureau-procedure oriented 'Kennedy boy' while Hackman is the older Anderson, less direct, but wiser and subtler in his approach. A Southerner himself, he understands the necessity of charming and sweet-talking the close-mouthed people of Jessup County, whose mentalities echo the dustiness of their town. Their antagonism is North vs. South in microcosm in the sad historical and geographical context of two cultures coexisting in an atmosphere of segregation, fear, and violence, all of them, one-sided. This tension creates a constantly anxious feeling as to plunge us into the dark and swampy context of Mississippi, 1964  appearing on a black screen while gunshots are fired.Through ""Mississippi Burning"", one of the best films of the 80's, Alan Parker delivers a profoundly humanistic message inviting people not to understand, but to be able to understand. And I can understand how white people would find some matter to criticize from the unsympathetic portrayal of the South as I can understand how black people would feel offended by their depiction as passive victims only saved by the providential intervention of the North. But this overlooks that the most touching character played by Frances McDormand is a Southerner, born in Jessup and not only she's sweet and loving but under the caring influence of Anderson, will give him crucial information. As it would be overseeing the part that black people played in the film, the anger expressed during the heart-breaking eyes-opening eulogy, the courage of Aaron, the little boy, and the people who defended their rights with what were at hands.I wasn't even twelve when I watched ""Mississipi Burning"" for the first time with my Dad, a Sunday night, and something really affected me, I guess it was my first mature introduction to racism in movies. It touched something so deep inside me that I couldn't help but think ""This is so wrong!"" Besides innocence, there was also a sort of genuine rationality speaking, ""how could even people do that?"" But I guess I was also guilty of a patronizing attitude as if I was happy for the poor victims to be helped, denying the significant role they played in this historical fight for Civil Rights in 1964. And maybe this is why I always watched and re-watched that film whenever I had this opportunity, almost as if I needed to always 'get' more from it, and to appreciate in the 'right way', to be 'able to understand'.And now, it's not the kid speaking but the young man, who 17 years after, learned –and I think it's an improvement- to put things into perspective. I watched the film again, and as you know how it happens, you have some particular scenes that get stuck in your memories, not the most impacting necessarily. I am not going to enumerate all of them, but there is one little moment particularly insightful. When Stephen Toboloswky as the leader of the Klan, was giving his speech about the Anglo-Saxon Christian Pride and the necessity of racial segregation to protect Mississippi's identity, this message full of hatred ignited the cheers of an illuminated audience. And the moment I remembered the most was this cute little blonde girl, applauding, with a sweet but creepy hypnotized look. She's like proud to belong to this people who're –in her mind- the best in the world.Later, it's like a translation into words of that simple moment. Frances McDormand talks about the trivialization of hatred, the way it's taught from cradle to grave, based on a fallacious reading of the Bible. This is not an alibi for racism, not at all, but a powerful attempt to prevent the film from Manichaeism, it's not plain racism, it's about ignorance, bigotry and hatred, and how Ward and Anderson discover the roots of this hatred, incarnated by the heinous face of the most detestable racist, admirably portrayed by Michael Rooker, and the hypocritical sneaky eyes of Brad Dourif, as the Klan-connected Sheriff's Deputy. The casting is full of familiar faces including Gailard Startain as the Sheriff and R. Lee Ermey as the Mayor, another reason for me to re-watch the film, although Hackman's performance tops them all.How the pride to belong to a group can be perverted by another corollary sentiment: to be superior. It's all a matter of perspective, and it's interesting that this comes from the director of a movie I truly admire and that I always defended, ""Midnight Express"" where the only way to overcome the racist simplification was to see things from each one's perspective. And ""Mississippi Burning"" is a remarkable hymn for peace and understanding driven by an extremely well-written script, and the dynamic between Ward and Anderson and the way the investigation will progress through the use of each one method. Ward believes in the law, Anderson, to get in the same level than your enemies, both are right and wrong in the same time, but their antagonism is mainly because of misunderstanding.Misunderstanding  whether it's ignorance, or ""being poor"", some people need to believe in 'being better'. And while some others believe it's 'morally wrong', they don't change the situation either, maybe we're all part of a hypocrisy surrounding the theme of racism, maybe we all are, not against a racial community, but it could be against a social, sexual or any category etc. We need to have one to feel better than.At the end, black and white sing in unison in a cemetery, a beautiful and positive note undermined by my vision of today's reality, and the way racism is still present, in so many other places in the world, that unlike 1964, are already being forgotten",Mississippi Burning
33,g-bodyl,"A Gripping, Tense Story!",9,20 June 2014,"Mississippi Burning takes place during a harrowing time for the United States and more specifically, the black people. In 1964, America was in the midst of the civil rights movement and in the South, racism was prevalent and tensions between both the whites and blacks were through the roof. This film does an excellent job on telling a story that depicts this and as a result, we get a film that's moving, touching, and even courageous.Alan Parker's film is about how two radically different FBI agents team together to solve the case of the three missing civil rights workers whom the authorities believe the Ku Klux Klan have a part in the disappearance.The acting is excellent thanks to the lead performances by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman, good as always, delivers an excellent ""deceptively calm"" performance. On the other hand, Dafoe plays by the book and does a great job. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse as well as she is the clue to exactly what happened to these three men.Overall, Mississippi Burning is an excellent, but very moving film as it tells a harrowing story. The white Southerners are depicted as evil in the film, but in reality they may have well been evil. They refused the blacks their natural rights and as a result, these sort of things happened. This is a great thriller and it's one that should keep you on your toes. I rate this film 9/10.",Mississippi Burning
34,secondtake,Powerful and necessary telling of a tale most of us already know,8,19 January 2019,"Mississippi Burning (1988)A powerful movie with a handful of first rate actors and a story of injustice that gets worse and worse. Gene Hackman leads the stellar performances-he's phenomenal-with Willem Dafoe and a young Frances McDormand supporting him beautifully.
I don't think the plot is exactly what moves this story along, but rather the overall theme. In fact, the brutal, ignorant racism that underlies the motives of the Mississippi men in the movie is a kind of given for the 1960s (and unfortunately, in some quarters, to this day). The FBI swooping down on this town is not quite the admirable sight it should be, and that's to the credit of the moviemakers. Large institutional law enforcement was necessary to break the local politics (and morality) there, but it comes off as heavy handed and insensitive.
And that's where Hackman thrives, being the loner amidst the crowd, doing the dirty work necessary and that ends up being heroic in the end.
The filming (and all the fires suggested by the title) make for a vigorous movie to watch. It's a good, classic telling of a well known tale. And I hint at what makes the movie a little limited-it is telling a story we all kind of know, that there were a lot of truly hateful white people inflicting harm and violence onf black people in the deep South. I wish it had found a way to make it more distinctive. Maybe for those who don't really know all this happened, it's a big bang way to find out, but if you already have the gist of it in your head, this will travel some familiar ground.
It tells its story so well, however, it's still a great watch. So watch.",Mississippi Burning
35,Irishchatter,Good movie but I think it was rather long!,6,28 February 2016,"I'm not saying it's the worst out there but, I just think the movie needed to be shorten a little bit. I kept seeing rather boring bits so that caused me to skip much of the film.Anyways let's move onto something positive, I thought Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman were excellent at playing the FBI agents. I loved how Dafoe's character Agent Alan Ward was a sarcastic yet let's-get-onto-the point type of guy. He really is a charmer and I began to have a little crush on him right from the beginning. I know, totally weird, right?I even loved how Hackman made his character Agent Rupert Anderson, a really humorous guy. Well he is a legend so, we can't complain,right?It is a really dark film with seeing the abuse of the African Americans during the 1960s. It does make you glad that nowadays, we all accept one another!",Mississippi Burning
36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Interesting story of pointless bigotry and hatred,7,25 June 2005,"I remember seeing this movie back in high school in RE (that's Religious Education for you folks who didn't have the 'privilage' of going to a strict Catholic Fundamentalist school) and thinking it was a pretty good movie. Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK, which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now. The other thing I remember was Trevor Jones' really cool-sounding Ry Cooder inspired score.Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists, one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago, 40 years after the crime, I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again.It's got a good story and is well acted, especially by Hackman, who is one of my fave actors (Dafoe is too but he's not in much these days). They play two FBI Agents, who don't get on (a popular cliché at the time), down in a backwoods southern town looking for three kids who have probably been killed by evil KKK members.The villains are despicable and Brad Dourif once again uses his wild eyes to great effect. But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.I was let-down by the ending and really wanted more red-neck, dirt-faced, hicka-billies getting their heads kicked in.

Hackman is terrific as an agent who doesn't condone the racism, but understands the culture of hatred, having grown up in the South himself.

38,Rodrigo_Amaro,Outstanding film and a great effort in dealing with difficult themes.,10,5 April 2012,"First of all, let me say that ""Mississippi Burning"" is one of my favorite films of all time, I've seen it several times, on several different occasions and periods of time, and it's a movie that always manages to change my view on things. It's funny, it's the same movie but looks like there's something new to be discovered there every time I see it. But what attracted me to write something about it now is the fact of watching it for the first time after seeing the award winning film ""The Help"", whose themes are a little similar but the approach given is completely different. Comes as a sad fact that people are running away to see ""The Help"" (which is good considering how long Hollywood hasn't dealt with a heavy subject that racism is), taking it too seriously believing it's all truth but they probably never watched Alan Parker's classic.Based on a real case that happened in 1964 ""Mississippi Burning"" starts with the brutal murder of three young Human Rights activists who were helping the black communities of Mississippi. Later on, the FBI comes to town led by the young and idealist Agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) followed by the veteran Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) to search for the boys in what most people thought to be a simple case of missing person. So, it was the 1960's, lines were divided and racism, lynchings were a common thing back there in the South and here's two agents and part of the Hoover boys trying to change things down there, having a lot of trouble in getting answers about what happened with those activists. While Ward wants to do the investigation by the book, following right procedures and all, the more experienced Anderson is quite the opposite, preferring to beat up suspects or use more unethical methods but always getting what he needs. He's a man that lived in a similar place and knows how things work so he understands he can't smile and be nice to people in order to get what he wants. Different men, clashing at each other from time to time but working on the same goal. In ""Mississppi Burning"" we feel outraged, angry, sad with all the hatred whites had for blacks in those days. Prejudice and its roots are difficult to understand, it's something we can't accept and we can't tolerate but the movie manages to give an inexcusable but quite real argument on why it happens. A key moment from the film is when Hackman's character tells to Dafoe a story that happened when he was a child, when his father killed the mule of a black man he knew, after getting sick of hearing his friends teasing him saying that the black guy was more important than he because he had a mule. Hackman concludes with this: ""My old man was just so full of hate that he didn't know that being poor was what was killing him."" Therefore, what we get here is that racism, in most cases, comes from a paranoia that one race must be better than the other, otherwise it'll take advantage of everything that exists. Absurd. Returning to ""The Help"" issue, (and I do like that film), I don't agree with that distorted, colorful and very humored presentation of how African Americans were treated in the South, the excess of comic reliefs were too much. The ones featured in ""MB"" are quite good and always followed by some tension in the middle e.g. when Rupert quotes to the Mayor Tillman about why he loves baseball as being the only thing where a black man can wave a stick without causing a riot. Sure, we're not getting a truthful full account of what really happened in 1964, there's plenty of fictionalized moments in Parker's film but it's easier to believe in this film than seeing all the humored moments of Tate Taylor's film. On its own, this is a really must-see film even though it's not much of a comfortable watching, it's a true challenge to many of us. Even today I get disturbed with some of the painful moments of it. It's haunting (in a good way). At the same time, there's more cheerful moments that are a great pleasure to see over and over (Deputy Pell getting his beard made by Anderson, best scene ever!). It's an impressive work in its technical aspects, the Oscar winning cinematography of Peter Biziou (an arguable work for many viewers since it's too dark but it reflects the serious subject); editing and sound, the music by Trevor Jones, the words by Chris Gerolmo who made a terrific script. The casting couldn't be better with Hackman in one of his greatest roles, Dafoe, Frances McDormand and the big team of villains played by Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Michael Rooker, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gailard Sartain and R. Lee Ermey, all spectacular performances.Alan Parker's most impactant film of the 1980's and certainly one of the greatest films of all time, ""Mississippi Burning"" might not be 100% real and not being all so truth to the facts but still works to present a dark period of American history. It's a gripping film that should be used in schools and in colleges. A nice suggestion to watch along with ""MB"" is the TV film ""Murder on Mississippi"" (starring Tom Hulce and Blair Underwood) that recreates the trajectory of the murdered activists. 10/10",Mississippi Burning

With a powerhouse supporting cast including, Francis McDormand, Brad Dourif, and a somewhat miscast R.Lee Ermy, the film is extremely well acted. The violence following Hackman and Dafoe's investigation is both convincing and repulsive. Hackman's occasional sense of humor is a welcome diversion from the oppressive atmosphere of hate. Although Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe play well off each other, neither could be considered a warm character. Special mention must be made of the soundtrack, which is both appropriate and excellent. - MERK",Mississippi Burning
40,tomgillespie2002,Powerful and beautifully-made piece,7,16 June 2016,"The main question looming over the head of Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is whether or not the film has a moral responsibility to tell its true-life tale of racial hatred and murder in Civil Rights Act- era Mississippi exactly how it happened, or if artistic license grants the creators of the film the right to tell an entertaining story that maintains a powerful message of social injustice and equal rights. I am of the opinion that any film can change events for the sake of a digestible narrative, as long as the facts aren't muddied for the sake of fitting a films own agenda. Like countless old World War II movies that softened the horrors of war or fabricated tales of heroism, a film isn't required to be a moving Wikipedia page as long as its heart is in the right place.Mississippi Burning opens with the brutal slaying of three Civil Rights activists - two white men and one black - by members of the Ku Klux Klan, in an event that would capture the attention of the entire nation back in 1964. Two federal agents are sent in to investigate, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi sheriff well accustomed to the attitudes of the small- town police forces in the state, and determined liberal Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Upon arrival, it doesn't take long for the agents to suspect widespread corruption within the police ranks and a possible cover-up. Anderson takes a hands-on approach of mingling with the locals and delivering thinly-veiled threats, while Ward respects rules and rank, bringing in over a hundred new agents to tackle the ever-increasing conspiracy.The idea to tell this story, which is one of the key events that led to the signing of the Civil Rights Act, through the eyes of two white men would be instantly scoffed at nowadays throughout social media, and perhaps rightly so. It is most importantly a story of the suffering of African-Americans, and of their bravery and spirit in taking a stand against it. Yet while Mississippi Burning takes a procedural, buddy- cop movie approach, it highlights how ultimately powerless the agents investigating the case are. Anyone familiar with the story will know that the men responsible for the murders were eventually brought to justice, but this is only one case in a country brimming with racial tension as social integration is introduced. It would take people such as the activists murdered in the film and the many Civil Rights demonstrations carried out in defiance that would ultimately lead to changes.At its best, the film is successful in making you feel extremely angry. As various African-Americans are lynched or attacked leaving a church by gangs carrying weapons, you, along with the bemused Agent Ward, question how such hate for another race can manifest itself within such a large portion of a community. With the FBI becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of co-operation from the residents of the town, the film somewhat indulgently gives us a scene of Anderson having an off-the-record word with suspected Klan members, particularly Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and hot-head redneck Frank (Michael Rooker). It's a punch-the-air moment of badassery, and one of many such scenes that allow the film to be entertaining as well as thought-provoking. It's far from perfect of course, with a shoe-horned romance between Anderson and Pell's suffering wife (Frances McDormand) in particular feeling wholly unnecessary, but this is a powerful and beautifully-made piece featuring one of Hackman's best performances.",Mississippi Burning
41,zkonedog,"A Bit Over The Top By Today's Standards, But General Themes & Hackman Keep It Watchable",7,6 April 2021,"When mentally compiling a list of greatest actors of all time (Stewart, Hanks, Cruise, Hopkins, etc.), Gene Hackman isn't one who often immediately springs to mind. Yet, I cannot recall ever see him give a truly bad performance. That streak continues with ""Mississippi Burning"", a film in which his character interactions go a long way towards keeping the overall experience relevant.For a very basic overview, ""Mississippi Burning"" tells the story of a 1960s Mississippi town that is being torn apart by racial tensions after three young civil rights activists go missing. FBI agents Anderson (Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) are sent to investigate the case, each bringing a different personality and style to the proceedings.By more modern (30+ years after its release) standards, this is a movie that can come off a bit ""over the top"". Nearly all the town residents are backwoods country hicks and no person of color is really given any agency within the story (only looked at as objects of pity). While the overall themes are as relevant today (if not more so) than they were at release date, the execution seems dated.Fortunately, the acting very much carries the load in ""Mississippi Burning"". This is especially true with Hackman, who brings an electricity with him to every piece of film he occupies. The chemistry he builds with Dafoe is also solid, as the two butt heads (but ultimately learn from each other) in trying to work together to prevent a major conflict. Also turning in solid character performances are Frances McDormand and Brad Dourif.Overall, I enjoyed ""Mississippi Burning"", if not to any ""best of"" capacities. While lacking the nuance that such issues are normally given now, it largely makes up for it in earnestness and just overall acting talent. Another example of an acting gem in Hackman's underrated career.",Mississippi Burning

Sure, KKK was the most visible racist but discrimination was endorsed by every one else : police, justice, white citizens In a way, this movie kicks where it hurts as i'm sure that this past threatens our amnesia ! To wake us, we have a great cop duo : for one time, the buddy team isn't called for fun but to be serious. It's cool to see Dafoe playing a good character for once and as an FBI agent, his uncompromising will for truth should lead him to the « X-files ».

Anyone who would normally shy away from racial dramas because of all the misery in it, might wanna give this movie a try, because the racists get battered heavily and have to pay for their crimes. However painful it is to watch racism, this movie has deliberately subdued the amount of violence that can be seen, so even sensitive/younger people could watch this racial investigative drama, without getting shocked too intensely.The excellent acting by the 2 leading F.B.I. agents, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, is what makes this movie really stand out. One young FBI agent wants to do everything by the book, the other more experienced agent (Gene Hackan) is a lot more cunning and uses dirty tricks to get results.

In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime.It is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII.

46,dee.reid,"Yeah, Where Does Hated Come From?",10,26 October 2001,"""1964.  When America was at war with itself.""What a tagline.  It signifies perfectly what was going on in the south during the 1960's.  The story to Mississippi Burning is simple.  Three civil rights workers are killed.  An investigation is launched to find the culprits.  Two FBI agents(Gene Hackman in an Oscar-nominated role and Willem Dafoe) are put on the case.  They encounter the hatred and violence that was associated with the investigation which included the usual burning crosses, lynchings, and Klan rallies.  I enjoyed this movie very much and just so you know, an African-American is writing this review.  I'm not going to go get all preachy now, but I will say this, racism SUCKS!  In my opinion, some people just can't grasp the concept that people will always be different and that's why some people feel more superior over another race.  It's just sickening to know that this stuff still goes on in America today, in 2001.  The acting here is great.  Gene Hackman is great as usual, and so is Willem Dafoe.  Frances McDormand is good too in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. I think two of the most over-looked performances ,however, come from Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell(who by the way is secretly a Klansman) and Michael Rooker who plays Frank Bailey, another Klansman.  Rooker's Bailey is definitely the nastiest, racist person ever brought to screen.  The scene where a group of Klansmen burn down a Black church is just terrifying.  When I saw him kick that young boy in the face, I saw just how hateful Bailey really is.  I felt like screaming to that boy to fight back even if it did mean certain death for him. Like the author of the review ""Where Does Hatred Come From?"", I think that the rally scene in the park was a very haunting scene especially with the little 3-year old kids smiling and cheering along with there parents. 
Lastly, I would just like to say that this movie reminds me a lot of Norman Jewison's film ""In The Heat Of The Night"" because both films have similar issues regarding racism in America.Mississippi Burning is a great film that shouldn't be missed.10/10",Mississippi Burning

The idea (one hopes) was to make a powerful, topical docudrama, but the result is an ugly, artificial, irresponsible exploitation of an actual civil rights crisis, condescending to blacks (condemning their treatment at their expense) and elevated out of all proportion by a false sense of prestige. This is true tabloid cinema, not far removed from one of Chuck Bronson's 'Death Wish' scenarios, with enough burnings, beatings and lynchings to satisfy even the most unrepentant redneck, and with the gall to suggest that the most effective answer to bigotry is to adopt attitudes and methods even more violent than those of the Klan. A first-rate cast is totally wasted by Chris Gerolmo's one-dimensional screenplay (and not for the first time: see 'Miles From Home').

49,estebangonzalez10,Hackman and Dafoe shine alongside McDormand,8,14 September 2015,"""Hatred isn't something you're born with. It gets taught... At 7 years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.""Alan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. The film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. The script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Mississippi Burning
50,Lechuguilla,Through The Mississippi Darkness,8,17 August 2014,"In 1964 three Civil Rights workers were murdered in rural Mississippi by Southern White racists. This film tells the story of the follow-up investigation by two FBI guys named Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe). Although the triple murder is based on a real-life case, script plot points are mostly fictional.The Anderson and Ward characters are fictional. And it's unfortunate that the writers here portray the FBI as the good guys, which is a distortion of the historical reality. The Mrs. Pell character (Frances McDormand), also is fictional and distracts from the case. While the inclusion of some fiction can be acceptable in real-life stories, since such films are not intended as documentaries, ""Mississippi Burning"" deviates too much from the historical truth, and that's my main criticism of the film.Some have argued that the film is biased because it presents a stereotyped view that all Mississippi Blacks were victims and all Mississippi Whites were villainous. But that's pretty much the way it was back then. Even now, I'm not sure a lot has changed since 1964, though villainy may be more subtle now. Because of the heavy political overtones, some viewers will necessarily be put off by the film's overall message.The visuals are the real strength of the film. Detailed prod design, period costumes, and the casting of local, non-professional actors make the film come alive with a sense of realism. Much of the plot takes place at night, thematically appropriate given that evil redneck thugs terrorized an entire race of people and caused untold suffering.Casting is appropriate, with the possible exception of Willem Dafoe, an actor with an annoying voice. Cinematography is quite good. Colors are highly muted; lighting is fairly low, with night scenes quite dark.""Where does it come from, all this hatred (toward Blacks)"", asks one character. It comes from the reality that the South never recovered from the Civil War. And all that resentment expressed in 1964 to some extent still exists, some 25 years after ""Mississippi Burning"" was made, and a half-century after the event upon which the film is based. Many Southern Whites just cannot let go of the past. Perhaps they never will ...",Mississippi Burning
51,jimbo-53-186511,Routine police thriller but its civil rights era setting does make it interesting,7,19 March 2017,"When three civil rights workers disappear FBI Agents Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) are tasked with investigating their disappearances. What starts out as a routine missing persons investigation quickly escalates into something much more serious especially when Ward (who isn't from Mississippi) starts to learn more about its townsfolk and about how those in charge choose to 'run' their town.I suppose it was kind of inevitable that a film like Mississippi Burning is going to be met with a rather mixed reception particularly as it apparently plays very 'loose' with the facts. In all fairness though anyone who watches a film and expects it to be 100% faithful or true to the story is somewhat naïve. What you get with Mississippi Burning is an interesting and fairly entertaining film which provides an insight into racial segregation in 1960's America - at least that's how I saw it!!!Although a lot of what we see may be fictional director Alan Parker works well with scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo in creating a powerful and somewhat terrifying look at the devastation that can be caused through bigotry and narrow-mindedness. Parker doesn't hold back and manages to stage some excellent scenes (the scene with Gene Hackman in the barber shop is particularly chilling as well as being memorable). The brutality continues throughout the film, which, admittedly, can make it hard to watch, but for me, this adds to the realism and Parker really engages with the viewer by drawing them into this appalling period of history.The strong performances compliment Parker's brutal direction well and the likes of Hackman and Dafoe are both good here (even though they are a rather clichéd pair of mismatched cops) Despite this though there's still an interesting and rather uneasy dynamic between the two men and the script occasionally affords them some amusing exchanges. The villains of the piece (Ermey, Dourif, Rooker, and Sartain) are excellent and all give rather sneering and cold-hearted performances.Aside from the cops and procedural elements being a tad clichéd one other aspect of this film that I found slightly problematic was the character of Mrs Pell (Frances McDormand). Her character is one of the few 'white' people who disagrees with segregation and is against how the Klu Klux Klan and the majority of white people treat the black people. This made her an interesting character who really should have had a more active role in the film. Instead of that, she is little more than window dressing and a bit on the side for Anderson (which is a tad frustrating and a waste of McDormand's acting talent). I personally felt that the film would have been slightly better if it had have at least given us some insight into what things were like on the other side of the fence.So yes there are some flaws with this film and rather ironically the narrative does suffer from being a bit 'black and white' However, it is a powerful drama that takes us back to an appalling time period, and although some of its brutality makes it hard to watch, I did find it to be a relatively engaging story.",Mississippi Burning

53,slokes,"""The Worst I've Seen""",6,15 February 2004,"In 1966, Martin Luther King visited Philadelphia, Mississippi, seat of Neshoba County and the town where three young civil rights workers disappeared two years before. Leading a procession of 300 people, he was confronted by a mob of angry white men brandishing hoes, broomsticks, and ax handles. One even turned a hose on King's group, which fought their way to the courthouse.There King confronted the deputy sheriff, Ray Price, who he knew had arrested the civil rights workers on the night they disappeared. He turned and told the crowd that there were people among them who had participated in the murder. ""You're damn right,"" Price muttered. ""They're right behind you.""King was moved to write later: ""This is a terrible town. The worst I've seen. There is a complete reign of terror here.""""Mississippi Burning"" aims to give a taste for how bad it was, and just how superhuman the efforts to stop it had to be in order to succeed. It's flawed because it's not terribly functional as a crime drama or nuanced enough as a civil rights story, but its heart is in the right place, its grasp of the situation solid, and its detractors mostly attack it for all the wrong reasons.Like why does ""Mississippi Burning"" give all the credit to breaking the murder case to the FBI? Didn't director Alan Parker and writer Chris Gerolmo know FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a racist? Yes, and he hated vigilante groups with a passion, particularly the Ku Klux Klan. Plus he was acting under orders of President Johnson, who was very disturbed about the disappearances, enough to place a phone call to a Mississippi senator asking for help finding the kids (and being told by the senator it was all probably just a hoax). WhiteHouseTapes.org has the phone calls on record, while Doug Linder's Famous Trials website has the full story. The FBI did send hundreds of agents to Neshoba County, they rankled the local authorities big time, they found the murdered workers, and they arrested several people for the crime, including the sheriff and the deputy sheriff, getting relatively light convictions for most, but convictions all the same, a first involving the murder of a black by whites.Did the black population of Neshoba County contribute much to solving the case? I don't know, but King's experience there is telling. There simply was no regard for the rights of non-whites. Blacks were completely powerless there, dealing with a white power structure that was nakedly aggressive about keeping them down. In many Southern jurisdictions, white authorities looked the other way when the Klan did their work. As the FBI investigation in Neshoba County revealed, the sheriff's office and the Klan worked hand in glove.""Mississippi Burning"" has great acting, sumptuous period detail, an unflinching desire to show the terrible toll of racism on a society, not only with lynchings but most powerfully, in the story Gene Hackman tells about how his father dealt with a black neighbor's mule. Just the way he uses his eyes as he tells the story, without the slightest attempt at drama, draws you into the terrible dehumanization that racism brings not to its targets but those who buy into it.The truth of the story was more shaded than Parker presents here. He's not a racist, or an FBI apologist. He's a filmmaker who wants to entertain his audience. He unrealistically overamps the Klan violence, to the point where they seem to be burning some black person's building once a week even though the FBI is making little progress through most of the movie. There's an early scene where Willem Dafoe's character (based not on an FBI agent but a Justice Department official named John Michael Doar) sits down next to a black man and starts asking him questions about the murder, in full view of a hundred or so people. No criminal investigator works like that, especially in the FBI.The story of the Mississippi Burning case is so compelling, why fictionalize it at all? The liberties they take, with the exception of the deputy sheriff and his wife, don't really help the plot out much. There's an attempt to make Hackman and Dafoe into fractious partners, but the scenes are ridiculous, especially when Dafoe pulls a gun on his partner after teasing him about his relationship with the deputy's wife.Frankly, the most interesting place this case was fought was in the courtroom, but we see little of that, or of Judge Cox, the bigoted federal justice who passed down the final sentences after heavy prodding from Washington.The movie does go for fireworks more often than it should. Hackman's two big confrontation scenes with the bad guys, at the speakeasy and in the barber shop, serve no apparent criminal investigation purpose and are meant to just make the audience feel good. He doesn't even get a word out of the deputy (played excellently by Brad Dourif) in between punches. But damn it works like hell.After the case was successfully prosecuted, Martin Luther King was moved to say the following: ""I must commend the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the work they have done in uncovering the perpetrators of this dastardly act. It renews my faith in democracy.""Manipulated or not, I feel the same way after watching ""Mississippi Burning.""",Mississippi Burning
54,gcd70,"Shocking, Powerful, Disturbing and Upsetting",9,26 February 2008,"Shocking, powerful, disturbing, upsetting and downright aggravating. All these words describe Alan Parker's film of the terrible injustice that was inflicted upon the Negro population in Mississippi, 1964. Though this was hardly an isolated incident. The fact is, white people have been oppressing minorities for as long as man can remember, and not just the African Americans who were captured and enslaved back in the 18th and 19th centuries. White man has marched through innumerable countries, taking over completely, and then either driving out or killing off the indigenous people. India, Australia, South Africa and North America are just a few examples.I do not believe the decent people of today ought to apologise for the actions of their forefathers, as much as they should be determined that equality rules this small planet we all share. Everyone hails from the same supreme Creator, who chose for his own reasons to colour our skins differently, and separate us into cultures. That does not mean we have the right to harm or kill those whom we fear, envy or otherwise do not understand. Jesus asks us to love one another as He love us. What we do to one another must make Him weep. And remember, Jesus was born an olive-skinned Jew, not a white Anglo-Saxon.Parker has fashioned a film which ruthlessly drives home the point that even if racism and bigotry is taught, or a learned behaviour, that it in no way can or should be tolerated nor condoned. It is as ugly as sin, and perhaps one of the most malignant and self-destructive illnesses of humankind, which threatens to eat away the very fabric of humanity even now, on the eve of the 21st century.Gene Hackman gives one of his best performances (possibly ever), as FBI agent Rupert Anderson, a tough old Mississippi boy who recognises racism for what it is, a disease. He'll stop at nothing, including making the rules up as he goes, to halt the injustice and bring the culprits in. Alan Ward is his by the book partner (played with true conviction by the ever underrated Willem Dafoe), a young ex-Justice Department hot shot whose aggressive passion is overshadowed only by his strong regard for Bureau procedure. These two leads are nothing less than outstanding. Entire support carries great weight too, with Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey and Gailard Sartain all leaving marked impressions. Trevor Jones provides a most effective music score, Gerald Hambling some expert editing, while the costume design team and art crew (lead by Philip Harrison and Geoffrey Kirkland) reproduce this turbulent time very convincingly.Chris Gerolmo's script (the historical accuracy of which is hotly disputed) does not paint a picture of purely good versus evil. There are no clear black and white boundaries depicted here, no innocents, just much grey area. But it's perfectly clear who the defenceless victims are. Maybe Gerolmo wrote this in the hope of educating us. Perhaps he hopes, as I do, that racism will one day be merely an ugly stain in history. Yet as of today, 1995, this is not so.Sunday, October 8, 1995 - VideoPowerful, powerful drama of the atrocity of racial abuse in America's deep south. Scripter Chris Gerolmo pulls no punches in his controversial tale and director Alan Parker (""Midnight Express"") has a hard hitting style that will rivet you.Trevor Jones' music is poundingly effective and editor Gerald Hambling is precise and efficient. Best thing about this great film is the ""tour de force"" performances from Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, each bringing to life two very different federal agents, both of whom are determined to put away the men responsible for murdering an African-American boy and two Jewish social workers in Mississippi.This team of experts have created a must see, compelling picture which will leave an indelible impression.Tuesday, January 14, 1997 - Video",Mississippi Burning
55,ShootingShark,"God Shall Enlarge Japheth, And He Shall Dwell In The Tents Of Shem; And Canaan Shall Be His Servant",7,20 September 2011,"When three young civil rights activists disappear in rural Mississippi in 1964, the FBI are called in to investigate. As racial tensions rise in a state which still has segregation, the local police department are implicated and the case becomes a media frenzy. Can the feds find the missing men and prove what happened ?Mississippi Burning is an incendiary movie. It doesn't worry about whom it offends and it doesn't shy away from the most horrible aspects of its drama. It presents the good old Jim Crow redneck South in a manner guaranteed to upset pretty much everybody, and leaves itself wide open to criticism on a lot of fronts; why do the heroes have to white, why do the cops all have to be Ku Klux Klan members, why do the feds resort to exactly the kind of hateful violence and intimidation they're there to put an end to, do we really need to see people beaten, lynched and humiliated every ten minutes, and what qualifies British director Parker to depict American society in so negative a way ? All these are legitimate complaints, but the answer to them all is pretty simple - that's just the way things were. Segregation was a way of life. Black voter registration in places like (fictitious) Jessup County was almost negligible. The movie's key exchange is when Hackman says, ""If I were a Negro I'd probably think the same way they do."", and Dafoe retorts, ""If you were a Negro, nobody would give a damn what you thought."". It takes two points of view - Dafoe's idealism and Hackman's easy-going pragmatism - and turns them into each other, with McDormand as the lynch-pin in the middle, and all three performances are terrific. The supporting cast is very strong, with Dourif and Rooker in particular as two of the scariest cops in any movie. Peter Biziou's bright day / dark night photography (which won an Oscar) in authentic rural Mississippi locations adds to the tension, as does the grim score by Trevor Jones. It's an unpleasant film, but a brilliant one and no matter how you may react to it, it forces you to evaluate your own feelings about the issues and to recognise that America has always been a country with a huge gulf between the haves and the have-nots. Loosely based on the real-life Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner murder case of 1964 in Neshoba County, albeit with much dramatic licence. This was the third in a great trio of strange and powerful dramas Parker made in the eighties (the other two being Birdy and Angel Heart), and is amongst his best work.",Mississippi Burning

57,Spleen,"Vile, but not for the reasons its detractors advance",5,4 April 2002,"Well, ""Mississippi Burning"" can be acquitted on one charge, at least - it doesn't glorify the FBI, which, as an organisation, did all it could to hamper the civil rights movement.  The heroes are two agents assigned to cover a particular case.  They may or may not be in sympathy with the organisation to which they belong; my guess is that they aren't.  There's certainly something curious about making the heroes of this particular story white FBI agents, but this isn't in itself objectionable - at least, not under the circumstances.But the film is still morally repulsive, for reasons that it worries me that no-one has pointed out.  When Anderson and Ward travel to Mississippi to investigate the murder of civil rights activists, they run into a stone wall.  Whites are too bigoted to talk to them and blacks are too terrified of reprisals.  If they charge a white man with a crime of violence they know that no local jury will convict and no local judge will sentence.  What can they do?They try for prosecution in a federal court, obviously - so far, so good. And to make absolutely certain that their charges stick they play dirty: they recruit thugs and extract information under torture and the threat of extreme violence.  If there's a single character whose actions we're meant to approve of, it's Anderson (invested with all the charm Gene Hackman has to offer) - and we see him wielding a razor blade, threatening to slash someone's throat.  He's not, in this scene, seriously attempting to find anything out, or even trying to coerce his victim into cooperating.  It's a mere display of strength and will.  When I first saw ""Mississippi Burning"" I was so infuriated by the racism that I managed to persuade myself (reluctantly, I hope) to cheer him on.  I was nearly sixteen.  I'm glad I don't have to admit to having been any older.

Then the main characters are introduced straightly with clear hints on their characteristics and values right on their first scene. The rest of the movie runs quite slow until about two thirds of the duration, then it goes faster in pace with shorter duration on scenes and sequences. The finale is a predictable inevitability yet it serves greatly in how things turn out to be. The compromise between the two main characters sure makes the unpredictability looks better. The acting is very nice in overall. Gene Hackman sure knows how to handle a hard character like this one. He even can build enough level of ambiguity at the starting points. Willem Dafoe sure can also handle his calm character well. His calm speaking manner is kind of his signature thing of his acting, although that will work even far more better if only he plays the antagonist.",Mississippi Burning

63,baumer,Where does hatred come from?,10,18 July 1999,"Where?  Where does racism come from?  How can one race feel superior to another?  Are we born with it?  No.  Do we become it on our own?  Maybe?  Or is it perhaps that we are taught it?  There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.  There is a rally at a park with the head of the KKK ( without his hood ) telling thousands of people that have gathered that he loves being white.  He loves the fact that Mississippi is segregated.  And in the crowd the camera pans across and shows three year old kids smiling and cheering as gleefully and loudly as their parent's are.  It is haunting.This film is bit like JFK in a way.  It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964, but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience. For example, the case was not cracked by Mr. Anderson fooling around with Pell's wife.  But that is besides the point, the point being that this film is mesmerizing.  Everything from its direction, cinematography, acting, writing and music, it is the best film of 1988.  And having Rain Man take most of the major awards is really quite sad.  Because Mississippi Burning is much more ambitious, important and well done.  Rain Man is a very good film and I will even go as far as to say that Hoffman is the only one that deserved to win best actor just as much as Hackman did.  But 1988 was a bad year for the rest of the Oscars.  Anyway...I have been edgy before.  Boyz and the Hood did that to me, but this film makes me angry.  It makes me want to jump back into 1964 and try to do something to stop this.  The film is that strong at showing us how terrible and pointless racism is.  And in order to make this film work, there has to be strong elements in all areas.  But for me, what really made me feel the things that I did is the actors that played their roles.Hackman is brilliant.  He gives the performance of a lifetime and it is his anger that gives him his edge.  He sees things differently than Mr. Ward does and that sometimes makes them bump heads with each other.  But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.  Just different ways of achieving that goal.  Dafoe is great as well, but it is the supporting cast that really makes this film.  From Dourif to R. Lee Ermey to Stephen Tobolwolski, these characters are richly portrayed by the actors that play them.  There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.  He plays Frank, the nastiest, meanest, no conscience, negro hating person that I think I have ever seen on film.  I don't know where his anger comes from, but he is the kind of character that you can imagine had a violent father that drank too much and always told stories about how bad the black man was.  When Rooker is on screen you listen.  You pay attention to what he is saying and doing.  And my hatred of him was one of my favourite parts of the film.Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do.  And they are powerless to stop themselves.  What happened to the three civil rights workers was a disgrace and a tragedy. But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.  Why did they have to die? Because they were a different colour of skin?  Because they were Jewish?  It really doesn't make any sense.Mississippi Burning is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is important and it is entertaining.  If you haven't seen it, do so just for the scene with Mr. Anderson and Deputy Pell at the barber shop.  That is worth the price of the rental alone.  But for a really important film that has something to say, this is one of the best.",Mississippi Burning
64,classicalsteve,Chilling Expose of the Damage Caused by Racial Hatred and Violence,10,10 April 2010,"In a barber shop, one of the locals in Meridian, Mississippi, declares, ""Our nigras were happy till those beatnik college kids came down here stirrin' things up."" This seemingly simple statement sums up much of the conflict of ""Mississippi Burning"": the clash between the ruling powers of white racial segregationists to maintain their status quo and leaders of the Civil Rights Movement bent on weakening and ultimately destroying Jim Crow laws in the south. Although the film at the outset comes off as rather ""black and white"", the white southern males portrayed as pure devils and the African-Americans as meek victims, the brutality and violence of what occurred during the Civil Rights Movements during the 1950's and 1960's is not exaggerated. The church-burnings and lynchings had been going on since the early 20th century and climaxed under Eisenhauer, Kennedy and Johnson. The happy ending was the signing of civil rights legislation by President Johnson, although many people paid a high price for this goal, some with their lives.""Mississippi Burning"" is loosely based on the investigation of three civil rights workers who disappeared while attempting to cross the Nebraska-Mississippi border in June of 1964. (Their bodies were eventually found in a hay stack, and their car was retrieved from a swamp.) Their crime: attempting to register Black and ethnic voters in the state of Mississippi. Most of the events, save for aspects of the investigation, have been largely fictionalized. However, the events as portrayed do well to paint a landscape of distrust and violence stemming from racial hatred and intolerance that was still prevalent in the deep south at that time. Federal agents, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman in tour-de-four Oscar-caliber performances, enter into what appears to be a mini-civil war. Members of the KKK and other supremacist groups run the town and surrounding area like a demilitarized zone in which white males hold all political power and keep blacks in living conditions that would give Auschwitz a run for its money. Whenever a black or ethnic minority challenges this status quo, either they are lynched or their house is burned down. And they burn down a black church for good measure. (Of course the arsonists also regarded themselves as Christians, but that's a whole other subject.) Law enforcement turns a blind eye to these heinous acts since they are in cahoots with the segregationists.Much of the film chronicles the federal investigation which reveals that the disappearance of the young men is just a tip-of-the-iceberg of racially-motivated brutality and violence maintained by a complex infrastructure designed to keep blacks and other ethnic minorities ""in their place"". ""Happiness"" as defined by the quote at the beginning of this review basically means living in squalor and fear with no hope of improvement. Simultaneously, the black community refuses to speak to the investigators fearing anything they say will have dire consequences at the hands of either local law enforcement or the supremacist groups. The African-Americans are in a no-win situation. Swift violence is inflicted upon them if they protest, but it also occurs without provocation. The racists literally get away with murder largely because they can. The film implies that these white supremacists burned several churches and homes during the course of about 2 weeks in the rural town of Meridian, Mississippi, probably excessive even by KKK standards. However, I think the point was to compress much of the violent and brutal behavior against African-Americans and other ethnic groups that reached a fervent pitch from about 1955 to 1965 into a single cinematic experience. ""Mississippi Burning"" is an attempt to demonstrate the nature of the destructiveness of the forces fighting to maintain racial inequality that had persisted since the end of the American Civil War 100 years earlier with the maintenance of Jim Crow laws.""Mississippi Burning"" is largely about how the southern white community feared the Civil Rights Movement--fear that manifested itself as crime and violence. You have to wonder what were they fearing? That a black man might find a cure for cancer, eradicate poverty, or, become President of the United States and enact a health-care bill? Fear is a very powerful force. Fear can be used to keep other people down but it can also be used to compel otherwise good people into the most heinous of acts through distorted rationalizations and fabrications. I don't believe all white southerners who fought against civil rights were pure evil. But I do think many of their minds were poisoned by fear and hatred. Maybe this film can help cure them.",Mississippi Burning

Alan Parker, as you might recall in his excellent 1978 drama Midnight Express, is fantastic at telling stories about the human condition as influenced by big bullies. Of course, the racist Southern Klan members are the big bullies here. In 1988, there was big controversy surrounding the film as people accused the film of being one of those ""white savior"" films. I get the justifications, but this is no documentary. This is a work of fiction that takes liberties with the truth to create a movie that not only entertains, but also scares you and make you laugh. Still, Parker does give his audience an idea what living in rural 1964 Mississippi can be like. And as for everything going on in the world today, this film holds a sense of relevance.Parker's magna opus, as some people have described the film, was a huge awards player come Oscar time. In addition to the amazing performances, I will never forget the striking images thanks to Peter Biziou's camera direction. The searing, flaming crosses, how the audience views the murder of the three men, etc. Are images that will be implanted in your brain. The 1960's is an altering year for the United States because of the Civil Rights Movement. Biziou's cinematography reflects the changing attitude and the resistance to this change. Between the cinematography, the thoughtful and well-researched screenplay from Chris Gerolmo, and the competent direction from Parker, this is a must-see film about an important time in our history.The movie came to be in 1985 when Gerolmo got his hands on a book about the FBI's investigation into the actual case. He wrote a draft of the script and later sold it to Orion. There were some interesting initial director choices such as Milos Forman and John Schlesinger, but Parker was the one who landed the role. As someone who knows all about the human spirit in extreme situations, he was a good choice to helm the project. Lots of research was put forth into the role. In the 2000's, we learn who the real Mr. X (the case's whistleblower if you will) was. But Gerolmo used Hollywood creativity to come up with who he thought Mr. X was, which allowed him to use Frances McDormand's character as film's moral character.It is 1964. Three Civil Right Activists from the North have disappeared after trying to help change voter laws. The FBI is sent to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) does not. Anderson is a former sheriff, and he understands the way of living down here. They keep their focus on Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and his wife (Frances McDormand). As the investigation continues, the local KKK outfit attack the African-American community. With no one on any side talking, Anderson is allowed to proceed with the investigation in any matter he sees fit.Great performances are abound here. Dafoe shows his range very easily as one movie he plays Jesus Christ and the next movie he plays a completely different role to great results. Even better were Gene Hackman (a legend) and Frances McDormand (the film's moral center). These two have fantastic chemistry with one another. Hackman's performance is more subtle, but you realize that he is growing fond of her and wants to take her away from the big, bad man that is her husband. In terms of the bad guys, Michael Rooker and Brad Dourif have made careers playing these types. Very effective!Overall, Mississippi Burning is a movie that should be seen. It is one of my favorite films of 1988 as it tells an incredibly important, relevant story. I would ignore these ""white-washing"" comments because it is a story of fiction. I would be very concerned otherwise. The intense, dramatic moments and images have been seared in my brain and they will be hard to forget. I became emotionally invested into the movie, and I am sure you will too. If you like Alan Parker's previous movies like Midnight Express or Angel Heart, you are going to like this one.My Grade: A.",Mississippi Burning

Three young guys, including a black man, were killed by KKK. Two FBI came to the village, where this happened and investigated the case It was just an example of what was going on there. The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way. I heard someone in Italian TV saying that Alan Parker directs wrong films, but this one is not the case.",Mississippi Burning
71,jdkraus,Hackman makes the film!,9,24 April 2006,"I saw this movie several years ago, and it is a good film. It is about the powers of racism and prejudice in the south during the 1960s. It sounds like another film about civil rights that most would say o.k., but Hackman brightens it and makes something worthwhile; he's performance is outstanding and believable, as well as the other tidbits! It has been tragically overlooked (Rain Man won everything), which makes me sad.So, the story is about three African-Americans who go missing, presumably dead. Agents are called in to investigate a possible clan that gathers in this town, which murders African-Americans for fun. Agent Anderson (Hackman) and Agent Ward (Dafoe) are the lead investigators. Their suspicions grow around the deputy (Dourif). His wife (McDormand) hides secrets that must be told which leads to a dangerous but vital path for everyone! Everything is good: the script, the music, the cinematography, the set-decoration, the view of an unforgotten south and the acting, especially by Gene Hackman. Due to its long length, I give it a ****1/2 out of ***** See it, it is an important film that teaches us all that we are all indeed human!",Mississippi Burning

Brad Dourif is still one of today's best and most underrated character actors. The entire movie is fabulous.PQ was pretty good. In fact, maybe too good.It was made in 1988 and set in 1964. The DVD seemed a bit more natural from what I recall. I wish I still had it for comparison.The movie was very clean and I didn't notice much grain. It just felt antiseptic. I figure it may have been my settings which I adjusted. I do like a bit of the soap opera effect on some movies and on this one it looked absolutely terrible.The adjustment did help to a degree, but it made me wonder about something.On some movies that get remastered, I feel like we lose something...especially for older movies which I have a nostalgic preference for. They don't feel quite as authentic as they did in the theaters at the time of their release.Perhaps the remasters in some older movies take away from their realness...the grit is lost which can impact the tone of a movie.Am I crazy here?

74,policy134,Probably the best movie of the late 80s,9,26 June 2011,"Some would probably disagree with the sentence above and point to Rain Man or Born on the 4th of July in that category, and they were good but focused more on the stars then on the actual story. It's a funny coincidence that Tom Cruise was in both of them.Mississippi Burning is a movie without star performances and simply focuses on telling the story. Granted, the real story about the actual event is heavily dramatized but it is really only to the benefit of the affect the movie has. There are superb performances of both Hackman, Dafoe and McDormand but they only service the story, which is rare in a Hollywood movie. No grand speeches about racial prejudices, just quiet observations.Where it gets its points across more loudly is in the violence. Be warned, this is a disturbing movie and should not be seen by children. However, the violence is far from gratuitous. Some people on this posts have complained that the white people look like ignorant, violent bastards here and the black people look too noble. That may be true but think about it, would you really have seen this if the black people were as vicious as the whites. You have to have somebody to admire in a mainstream film. Just look at all the films from the 30s and 40s? Was that more to you liking than people portrayed here? I think that people who complain about the white characters here should really think about what they are seeing. This is a film that focuses on two white characters and it is made by a Brit, not a black person.",Mississippi Burning

Now that's what I'm talking about!,8,7 October 2002,"Okay fine the title is a little cheesy but regardless this is one heck of a good movie with a great performance by Gene Hackman. Now what I really found interesting about this movie was that in a way the director and/or writer tried to make a statement by saying that racism is taught. Which I belief is true! There is this great scene where the two agents are viewing a film of a KKK member, unhooded giving a speech while you see little kids walking around dressed like the clan.

""Mississippi Burning"" tries to show us a part of such sad times when black(I apologize for the primitive term) people were treated with immense hatred and differences. Gene Hackman in one of his better roles and Willem  Dafoe doubly so try to uncover the mystery behind a murder of three activists and as they go along they realize that a big part of the town shares its views with the KKK, especially the people in high places. Understanding the hatred of these primitive people is truly beyond me and if there's one thing this movie does is show how terribly limited and stupid they are. Great directing, great performances all around and a terrible feeling of sadness and joy in the end.8/10",Mississippi Burning

79,cat_ranchero,Thought-provoking and powerful...,9,25 July 2013,"Although based on real events, the filmmakers go to great lengths to make it clear that this is a work of fiction. As such it works very well; it is a very powerful drama that puts the fight for civil rights to the fore. I must say I found it quite thought provoking, very well made and really well shot. The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell. I also have to mention a couple of small roles; it was nice to see both Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley and R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman; I know they didn't have an awful lot to do, but they were both quality. Over all, an interesting drama that kept me interested all the way through – a definite 'must' for any cinephile.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Mississippi Burning

82,deanofrpps,You have to pull it apart from the inside,8,25 June 2020,"The death of Edgar Ray Killen in prison in 2018 has renewed interest in the Mississippi Burning case.Lets turn the clock back half a century It's 1964. Three civil rights workers, a black man James Chaney from Meridian, Mississippi, and two whites Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner said to be from New York City disappear after being briefly detained by local police in Philadelphia Mississippi. Enraged, President Johnson ordered the Navy to drain the alligator - infested swamps of Mississippi in search of the three. Freedom RidersIn Mississippi Burning (1988) the story of the investigation is brought to the silver screen. While the Navy up to its hips in sludge has been unable to locate the missing Freedom Riders, Johnson dispatches FBI agents, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a local Mississippian and former sheriff to investigate. Chafing under Ward's micromanagement in insisting upon a futile by - the - book approach, Anderson through seductive down - home charm, develops an informant in Mrs Pell (Frances McDormand), the battered wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif).Discovery of the bodies leads to a turning point in which Ward, acknowledging that the book has no answer, accedes to Anderson's irregular tactics: kidnapping glib and unbelievably cute Mayor Tilman and forcing him to describe the killings and reveal the culprits, assaulting Deputy Pell in reprisal for beating Mrs Pell, luring the cluprits to a bogus meeting and rescuing Lester Cowen from a faked attempt by the co-conspirators to hang him. Under the erroneous belief that his fellow bad guys intend to kill him, Lester spills the beans.Charged with civil rights violations, many conspirators including Deputy Pell are found guilty. Sheriff Stuckey is acquitted. Mayor Tilman commits suicide.
Gene Hackman plays the two - fisted Rebel Sherriff Anderson turned FBI agent with great aplomb. Sweet as sugar and mean as dog dung, Anderson can molt from as gentle as a new - born calf to as aggressive as a charging bull.
Hackman's Pennsylvania accent does not creep into his Southron expressions or speech as it did in his depiction of a New York City Detective in the movie version of French Connection.William Defoe plays the stamp pressed FBI agent, with the pressed dark suit and homburg in the sweltering heat of the deep South.

Gene Hackman gives a power-house of a performance, ripping up the screen in every scene.

84,jeremy3,Stereotypical portrayal of the southern whites.,1,15 January 2011,"I hated this movie. It is not that I don't think what some did in the South wasn't a horrible crime, but this film stereotypes the South. Senator Julian Bond, a black senator, rightly said that the 'FBI really did nothing for blacks in the South'. I can't disagree with this. I love Hackmann, but his character is an insult. He is shown as trying to be Robin Hood, but that wasn't the truth.I also am tired of movies that stereotype poor southern whites. In this movie, all white and poor southern males are portrayed as ""monsters"". That's bigotry just as bad as any bigotry. Worse than that, it is false history. Just like how Gone Like The Wind glorifies the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners, it was the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners who ruined the South - pitting poor whites against poor blacks. So, where is the ""evil"" rich white character in this movie? Nowhere. In other words, all poor whites are ""evil"", but you can't possibly indict rich northerners and rich southerners, who kept poor people of both races enslaved and against one another.

Two FBI agents are sent down south to investigate the murders and a hellish hornets nest is disturbed with far-reaching consequences. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe convincingly play the contrasting lawmen as they constantly butt heads on how to conduct the investigation - one a by the book worker the other a no holds barred enforcer. The scenes of beatings, lynchings, tears, arson, explosions, violence and murder move and disturb making one face the raw naked face of human nature and questioning one's own.

When America was at war with itself.Few other films are as powerful, meaningful and profoundly unsettling yet simultaneously intense and action packed as Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. To say that this film is good would be an understatement. There are two ways this film can be seen - Firstly this is a first rate police thriller, superbly shot, it delivers maximum impact.Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion, this film is a sumptuous documentation of extreme racism in the Deep South in the 1960s. The Declaration of Independence states that ""All men are created equal"". This ain't true in Mississippi. This film is harrowing, it is not easy to watch and at times it is simply emotionally overwhelming. This is one piece of cinema which displays the mindless and infinite callousness and savagery that is possessed by humanity. What makes us so hateful? This film does not investigate such complex issues,it rather shows its devastating effects.The murder of 3 civil rights activists in Mississippi in 1964, attracts external police forces (mainly the FBI) to investigate the disappearance of these 3 young people (2 white, 1 black). Head of operation is Mr. Ward, played with a commanding and controlled brilliance by Willem Dafoe and accompanied by Gene Hackman. Now here is the thing with Hackman, he is one of the greatest screen actors of our time. His presence transcends beyond the screen, whenever he is on the screen he steals the show. Few other actors are as magnetic as Hackman, especially when we see him get angry.This is an excellent achievement, with an outstanding cast, including Frances McDormand in a superb performance.When you see this film, ask yourself one question.

I saw this because Alan Parker made one of my favorite movies ever (Angel Heart - but Parker also made a lot of lesser films) and because Gene Hackman -one of the most natural and effortless actors of all time- plays in it (and I rarely see a movie for the actor). Hackman plays the lead with a very young Dafoe and both do an excellent job as well as the rest of the A-level cast (R Lee Ermey, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Frances McDormand & Michael Rooker).

88,Aly200,"An Important Film about Racial Tension, Political Views and Humanity",7,20 January 2017,"Films that deal with civil rights issues can be a touchy subject and Alan Parker's 1988 film about true events was a firestorm for controversy. The film's dark subject matter about violence towards the African-American community in 1963 Mississippi remains an important part of shaped the eventual progress to equality for all races. The film tells the tale of two federal agents (Gene Hackman as Rupert Anderson and Willem Dafoe as Alan Ward) sent to the Deep South to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers (two African- American men and one Caucasian man). What the men find is the roots of corruption run deep in the town as the local lawmen and KKK members attempt to scare Anderson and Ward off, but their reserve steels the agents against the hate they constantly endure.As the leads, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the voices of reason among the judgmental and horrible characters in the small town their characters are investigating. Hackman plays the loose cannon officer who will bend the rules to get results while Dafoe is the by-the-books and ethical man, but later converts to Hackman's tactics after tensions boil to a breaking point between Anderson and Ward. The actors' chemistry is palpable as they play off each other in tandem from verbal sparring to their eventual physical confrontation, but without losing a mutual respect for how the other handles the investigation.The narrative is loosely inspired by the actual disappearance and murders of three civil rights workers (as depicted in the film's opening scene). However the movie delves into fiction for the majority of its run-time which does hurt the accuracy of the story. The inaccuracies however do not take away from the gripping power of the story as the movie is more focused on the inherent racism in the South during the 1960s. The movie's subject matter lent to controversy about the violence depicted against the black community, but the film scored Oscar nominations despite the criticism (however star Gene Hackman grew wary about films with such violence which caused him to withdraw from participating in ""Silence of the Lambs"" after he had bought the rights).Do not miss this film, it'll open your mind on what it was like back in an era of civil unrest.",Mississippi Burning
89,Gubby-Allen,Awesome,9,2 January 2002,"I can't believe this film isn't in the Top 250 of all time. Apart from being brilliant, it's exactly the sort of powerful, full metal jacket type film that people love.As great as it was there were some sickening scenes. I lost count of the amount of times I thought to myself either 'thank god we don't live in a world like this anymore' or 'we're fortunate if the racists were based on real characters, that they'd probably be dead by now, or if not then not too far off it'.Every aspect of the segregation & bigotry was pathetic. I'm ashamed that this was as recent as one generation ago. I know racists are still in this world, but I can only see watching this film as being positive as having a positive bearing on the issue. It asks the question everyone has pondered on. Where does the hatred come from?Children will play and talk to anyone. Black, white, chinese, Jews, anyone. Unless they're manipulated, generally by adults (parents) or some form of media.The best thing with this film is that the public of Mississippi were shown to be absolute morons. The scene where the reporters questioned them, to which their replies were ""well they're different to us & don't wash"" or anything that came out of the judges' gob, was so laughable, it wasn't worth taking seriously. So I can't see how anyone can question that the non FBI whites came out positively in this film.Great acting too from Dafoe, Hackman & McDormand.One previous commenter here, claimed that if you enjoyed this film you're a closet racist & as bad as the people in the film & the ones that made it. That's exactly the sort of imbecillic extremist comment & reason why the problem of racism will probably never be completely eradicated in our lifetimes.Fair enough, the FBI may have been seen as the heroes & problem solvers and not the black townfolk. I don't know US / Mississippi history well enough to comment on how accurate or factual that is, but I would guess that the truth was bent considerably and the negroes did far more for racial problems than this film suggests, but to label people racist for enjoying this film, is ignorant & childish.So people who enjoy films about drugs are all crack addicts eh? People who enjoy a film about drink driving or joyriding are as bad as them in the story? No. Hopefully they'd never consider doing any of the above after watching it & they'd have the brains to form their own opinions. OK, there'll always be one or two of the braindead who'd slip through the net, but most people would be ok.Just because you enjoy a film doesn't mean you're sitting there nodding your head in agreement & chuckling away throughout as if it's Airplane. There were scenes in this you could barely watch & made you ashamed & embarassed, but it kept your attention for over 2 hours, and that's what all great films do.9/10",Mississippi Burning
90,Sonatine97,Symbolic Burning Crosses and Simplistic Storytelling,8,18 August 2002,"Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 .Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now  hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill).They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren't quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime.Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons.Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town's police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit.With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman's rules this time.....A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates.
This major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all.British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker's limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious.I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman's character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe's preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would've added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure.This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an ""outsider"" looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame.If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.***/*****",Mississippi Burning

92,faraaj-1,1964 - The year America was at war with itself!,10,6 September 2006,"1964 - The year America was at war with itself! Thats a pretty good tag-line. The promotion for this film seemed to pitch it as a thriller or a buddy movie. It is neither. This is a very mature investigation of a racist Mississippi town where the brutal murder of three civil rights activists took place in 1964. The film is inspired by real-life events.Dafoe and Hackman play the two FBI agents sent to investigate. Their differing styles of pursuing the case and Dafoe's belated admiration for Hackman's ""method's"" is an interesting layer of flesh added to the structure of the film.You will see some really nasty racist characters played by familiar faces like Brad Dourif, Lee Ermey and an especially violent Michael Rooker. All are excellent. Frances McDormand really steals the movie as the wife of racist Dourif.This film is far more intelligent than some of the Stanley Kramer movies of the 60's which dealt with racism. It does not shy away from showing the seriousness (and sickness) of the racial mindset without being excessively preachy. It is in fact very watchable - largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi small-town Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.Highly recommended!",Mississippi Burning

95,Barky44,"An important film, but fails to connect with its characters",8,15 June 2006,"Mississippi Burning is probably the most important film to come out in 1988. It is a fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, a tragic, yet important, period in American history.I only wish the film itself were better.The key problem with this film is the character connections. I just didn't feel connected to any of the characters, they all seemed fairly shallow. Gene Hackman's bad cop, William Defoe's good cop, Francis McDormand's bullied housewife, even Brad Dourif's treacherous deputy sheriff, none of them really had bit of magic required to make the viewer connect with the character. I don't think it's the acting, they all tried to do the best with what they had. I think the fault lies with the writing.I think the writer made a mistake by including too much interaction between the two FBI agents (Hackman & Defoe) and not enough into the interactions between them and the locals, and between the locals themselves. Frankly, the film relies so much on stereotype to create these characters, it's hard to get into them.I also feel they shortchanged the black cast members. They're basically relegated to being beaten around, and singing at church. There's only one important scene involving blacks, the lynching of a father who's only trying to save his cows. Otherwise, they're simply window dressing.I would love to see this film remade by a talented writer/director. Perhaps Spike Lee would love to exchange his New York City backdrop for a deeply Southern one. Now THAT would be a film.8 out of 10. It's still an important story, and a risk for Hollywood, and it deserves props for that. But it could have been better.Barky",Mississippi Burning
96,DeuceWild_77,"""When America was at war with itself..."" - a gripping & engaging experience !!",9,10 September 2017,"One year after his misunderstood masterpiece, ""Angel Heart"", the English director Alan Parker returns to the South for filming ""Mississippi Burning"", a crime / thriller drama about 2 F.B.I. agents sent to Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of 3 civil rights activists. Led by the younger agent, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), a yankee 'crusader' and a symbol of Kennedy's administration, who follow the Bureau's rules by the book & his older and savvy partner, Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi Sheriff, who knows the behavior, mentality, traditions & way of life of his fellow countrymen. When they suspect that the Ku Klux Klan may be operating there and responsible for the disappearance of the 3 activists with the support of the local law, Ward & Anderson start a war against the ""phantom' killers in searching for the truth, clashing with the town people that don't want them there... Superbly directed motion picture from an engaging screenplay penned by Chris Gerolmo, based on actual facts and visually stunning, shot by the cinematographer Peter Biziou, who won a well deserved Academy Award, ""Mississippi Burning"" is a gritty, realistic & sweaty movie experience, filmed on location near where the actual murders took place with even some scenes shot in a documentary style which enhanced the straight tone of the film. It moves at a thrilling pace, involving the viewer in the sordid ways of racism at his worst, stereotyping that (almost) all of the white southern characters are evil and preaches the audience about the innocent victims of the intolerance and the deserved punishment of their executioners, guided by the eyes of two different lawmen, the liberal moralist - Willem Dafoe and the conservative 'vigilante' , Gene Hackman. Hackman delivers maybe his best performance since his brilliant turn in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" ('74), he's determined, reckless & sarcastic, showy, but commanding the screen with gravitas proving why he's one of the best (still sadly, underrated) north American actors ever. Willem Dafoe, fresh from his Academy Award nomination for ""Platoon"", co-stars in a less prominent role, but equal effective, especially in his ""boy scout"" antagonism with the Hackman character. Frances McDormand, who scored a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, is the stand-out / revelation as the disgruntled & fragile wife of the local Deputy. She shines in a role that could have been underplayed if performed by a less capable actress. The supporting players are top notch (kudos to the casting department & Parker's skillful direction of actors) from the always remarkable as the hateful 'usual suspects"": Brad Dourif & Michael Rooker to R. Lee Ermey; Gailard Sartain; Badja Djola in an intense cameo appearance; Tobin Bell, making here his feature film debut, years before his breakthrough role in the ""Saw"" franchise and Stephen Tobolowsky, among others. In short, ""Mississippi Burning"" was one of the best films of 1988, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Leading Actor for Hackman, winning 1 and perhaps only lost the Best Picture Oscar, due to the Academy's emotional vote in favor of Barry Levinson's sympathetic drama, ""Rain Man"". Highly recommended !!",Mississippi Burning
97,bcheng93,the truth was far worse,8,2 March 2014,"my summary line is actually what another reviewer who lived in Mississippi( during depicted time) and gave this movie i believe only 3 stars wrote in his review. this reviewer i believe is white and the only reason he gave this movie 3 stars was because he...and i also feel this way, felt that "" the truth was far worse "" and the depictions of the movie didn't do the Evil justice. in other words it was a lot worse then the movie depicted. evil is not spread by the idiots that commit the hate crimes but by the people who hold the power and want to hold on to that power. the strong will always bully the weak and only in rare occasions does it not happen, which just goes to show that "" man doesn't learn from history( as much as hes studying it )and is doomed to keep on repeating mistakes made thru-out history. it make not be crystal clear today but i know for a fact that there is a lot of racism in southern America, its just hushed up that's all! hey look at it this way to prove my point of "" the strong bullying the weak...its not even about the color of the skin"" take for example certain parts of Africa where there's no whites around...its black on black and what about north Korea, where its yellow on yellow.OK, i'm rambling a little now but the movie although it wasn't the truth-fullest depiction was still very very good and will stand the test of time as a classic. just movie-wise how can you not like a movie with ( hackman, dafoe and mcdormand in it. the movie gets a 8 because it had great acting, directing and was brave enough to touch upon a touchy matter.",Mississippi Burning

Searching for the boys leads to them finding more corruption and hatred that could have ever been imagined.Mississippi Burning is one of the few films that actually capture the brutality of some events that took place during this sad era in history. The audience is shocked and thrown around through a series of emotions, helping bring across the meaningless of hatred and the realism of that time period. The visual images portrayed are very hard to watch, making the film quite successful in its attempt to bring a point across.Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman play ""the good cop, bad cop"" partnership perfectly, helping create an almost flawless film. The chemistry they held was almost so obscure and confusing, it was realistic and some how gives the audience a feel of a real-life partnership. The persistence of the two men's characters was very courageous and inspiring also, making even me want to be an FBI Agent after watching the film.

101,Newsense,"""What is wrong with these people""",10,5 July 2009,"I never understood why this movie was never on the Top 250. If American History X can make the Top 250 why not Mississippi Burning? Even Crash made the top 250 and this movie is way more powerful than Crash will ever be. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era. The story details FBI agents Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman)and Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe) search for the killers an African-American male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the racism is deep-seated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were. No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didn't make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these racist lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in raw sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen. Conclusion: Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the racial violence and slurs you have a gem on your hands. I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didn't have many movies after this one.",Mississippi Burning

105,Ryu_Darkwood,Dafoe and Hackman are an excellent duo,9,8 December 2007,"This movie deals with the question if it is okay to use non-ethical methods of working by cops to fight outrageous injustice. Its setting is an American village in which the black population is systematically being abused by white supremacists. A young FBI-agent from New York ( Willem Dafoe ) and his cynical partner ( Gene Hackman ) discover that the racism is broad amongst the population and that even authority figures are involved in it. Every time they find a way to deal with the problem, they stumble upon fear, and therefore unwillingness to cooperate , from the blacks. At a certain point the agents find themselves using pure intimidation and violence to fight back against the injustice.I like it how the relationship between Dafoe and Hackman is slowly evolving throughout the story. At first there is some unwillingness to work together, but slowly they start to accept each other and their different methods of working. ''Good cop'' Dafoe is the honest one never straying from the law; Hackman is the bad cop who will use intimidation to get to the core of things. Both characters aren't necessarily heroes. They are flawed, emotional beings that stand seemingly powerless against something that is so much bigger than they realize at first. At a certain point both their methods of working mingle together in the sake of solving things.It's also nice that Hackman's character becomes involved with the case when he's experiencing the brutality of the situation; from a clearly apathetic person he turns into someone who is bend on fighting the injustice.I find this one of the best movies made about the recent '' Apartheid '' in American history. It is realistic, gritty and has no false sentimentality in it. It tells a brutal tale without creating heroes and villains.",Mississippi Burning

107,Maladjusted_1,Unsettling but excellently performed,8,5 November 2016,"When a film is based on a true story, it can amplify its emotional effect significantly - think of classics like Attenborough's 'Gandhi', Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' and Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia'. The tragic history behind Alan Parker's film makes an already dark tale into a deeply unsettling one. Parker has a great ability to evoke a sense of despair, having done so to great effect in the earlier films 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'. The credit isn't all Parker's, though: he had to have people convey his vision; the people he chose did so very effectively. The two leading actors, Willem Defoe and Gene Hackman, both have a knack for playing villains and menacing characters, and have played the antagonist in a superhero film. But that's pretty much where the similarities end for me. They come from different generations and play their best roles very differently, but if you first saw them in 'Mississippi Burning', you'd be forgiven for thinking that they were a long-standing film duo, like Lemmon and Matthau. Hackman and Defoe are accompanied by a range of highly talented actors, including Oscar winner Frances McDormand, the always enjoyable R. Lee Ermey, and two of the men we'd later find stirring trouble in 'The Walking Dead' – Pruitt Taylor Vince and Michael Rooker. Everyone involved in 'Mississippi Burning' plays their strengths effectively, ensuring that Alan Parker's dark historical drama isn't a film you're likely to forget.",Mississippi Burning

Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe do make a formidable lead cast. A special mention of Gene Hackman, who steals every scene with chilling perfection and agility. Willem Dafoe does well for a procedure following agent, who inevitably learnt that Justice isn't always through procedures. Frances McDormand is intense in her tough yet small role. Rest like Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky does very well. A special mention for then-unknown Tobin Bell who has a small role.""Mississippi Burning"" strength lies in its accurate and natural portrayal of racism in 1960s era in most of America, Mississippi in the movie. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do. The sincerity with which Director Alan Parker depicts the events is amazing, with appropriate mix of gore, violence and torture. But having said that, this movie deals with a very sensitive issue and it largely enclose itself in the racism context.Overall, ""Mississippi Burning"" achieves what it sets out for. It was never about sending a message for equality or peace amongst races. It showcases the difficult times of 1960s and how a few good men delivers justice, unbeknownst of consequences.My Verdict: 8/10",Mississippi Burning
109,enmussak,"Powerful film, emotional manipulation",9,25 December 2002,"There have been few films that played with my emotions like this one (Lynch's Elephant Man and The Green Mile are a few others).  Seeing this film just makes you angry... the characters are deep and the setting is ridden with conflict.  This whole film is set in tension between Black and White culture, and the FBI vs. local authority.  Many times I was asking myself, ""can the FBI step in here?  What is their jurisdiction?""A brief homage to Gene Hackman.  He is one of my favorite actors and I have yet to see him in a role that he has not performed masterfully.

111,DaRick89,Imperfect but nonetheless powerful and even essential viewing,9,13 November 2017,"Mississippi Burning has cultivated a well-deserved reputation as a powerful but nonetheless imperfect film. It is powerful not only because of the emotionally charged topic (civil rights and racism) but also due to some effective acting, strong characterisations and also a shudder of drama and tension throughout. However, it is imperfect because it is slightly overlong, somewhat historically inaccurate (the FBI's role in promoting civil rights was far more ambiguous than portrayed here) and even clichéd at times. Luckily, the film does neither abuses those clichés nor plays them entirely straight, allowing the film to retain its impact after many years. The film's power and tension is conveyed even during the very first scenes. The car chase is unnerving and the murders themselves are even moreso, with the merest splatter of blood hinting at the violence which occurred. Not a single moment is wasted on unnecessary blood and gore, which would otherwise have been unfitting for a historical drama like Mississippi Burning. Tension in the film is built even more effectively by intertwining the more sedate scenes with conflict and even outright violence. For example, Agent Anderson's quiet dialogues with the deputy sheriff's wife are punctuated by churches blowing up and arguments between Agent Anderson and Agent Ward. Speaking of Agent Anderson and Agent Ward, their characterisations are quite strong, in that the film provides a substantial backstory explaining their involvement and motivations (particularly Anderson) but also somewhat clichéd. This is because they both represent the perennial conflict between the renegade hero (Anderson) and the by- the-book, obstructive police chief (Ward). These roles are subverted though because Anderson sometimes does call Ward out for not properly following procedure, while unlike most police chiefs Ward knows exactly who the enemy is and does not resort to dramatics as readily as your average police chief type. The characterisations of the supporting cast are predictably less substantial. Much insight is provided into the wife's reasons for sticking with an obviously unpleasant husband, but the villains are broadly painted as hateful racists. The reason is likely to make it easier for the audience to oppose them and on that level such broad, simplistic characterisations work well. In addition, such characterisations do not necessarily prevent the actors from providing good performances. Brad Dourif does well representing your average bully; able to beat up on weaker people but impotent against a powerful adversary. Michael Rooker is even better; his Frank Bailey is comfortably the nastiest, most menacing character in the film, with none of the blustering of Stephen Tobolowsky's character. Tobolowsky's character is suitably provincial but was he really meant to be that blustering? R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain and Pruitt Taylor Vince basically play good ol' Southern boys, with Ermey infusing a little Sergeant Hartman into his performance when he argues with Ward.On the other side of the coin, Willem Dafoe is cool, clinical and professional, while Frances McDormand plays the beleaguered housewife very well. However, it is really Gene Hackman who steals the show. Jocular one moment to physically violent the next, every scene with him is essential viewing because he raises the tension and drama. Badja Djola also warrants a mention, for his character veritably oozes hatred and menace. The dialogue is suitably provincial, with some rather zany lines (""cornhole ******?""). The plot plays much like a standard cop drama, with police being required to solve a mystery. Luckily, such a premise is exploited for maximum value, not only because of the tension and drama, but also because of the high stakes (freedom for a hitherto oppressed people). Ultimately, Mississippi Burning has its clichés and historical distortions, but ultimately the acting, characterisations, drama and tension make for a potent film and essential viewing. 4.5/5 stars",Mississippi Burning

But, I watch this movie at least once a year to remember what Martin Luther King fought and marched for.I spent 6 months in Florida in 1962 at my older sisters home recovering from my leg surgery. I spent most of that time on the ""other side"" of the wall separating the whites and blacks. I would go over fishing with them for fresh water Mullet, and listening to their stories. There were a few times they told me to leave before something bad might happen, but I was only 9-yrs old at the time. I just didn't know or understand. Granted Florida was not the same as Mississippi, but the KKK were everywhere down south.Growing up over the next few years I remember the episode of the 3 civil rights workers as well as the churches always being burned to the ground.

115,JoeC345,Blind Hatred,10,29 January 2011,"A little after the half way point in this film a main character is describing how how hatred is taught and that the after hearing something numerous times you stop questioning it.This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. I first watched it in my 8th grade history class which is almost 10 years ago now. The thing that struck me the most was how no one person was actually ""evil"" but when a group of people get together it's a different story.The atmosphere is genius, the layout of the town looks vivid and alive. Unlike some movies with only two or three dedicated sets this one literally is the town. The people of the town seem pitch perfect for their roles, from the F.B.I. agents to the town Sheriff to everyone else. While I'm on the topic of characters I want to say how much I appreciated the fact that they, in one way or another, developed most of the people you meet by showing where they work, live, and give them personality.Now to discuss a little bit of the tone of the film. First off I never completely understood racism. The hatred of a group of people for any reason never made sense to me. As I said in the start of this review when something is taught to you, you don't think to question it. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's relying on blind hatred of some offense you think happened or were told happened. If that little bit didn't make sense racism doesn't make sense to me.The little things that are present here is what makes it a great film especially since none of the character development is done for the sake of the plot but for the sake of the character.Both Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are great actors and are amazing in there roles but between the two Hackman has a more subtle way about the way he investigates a case unlike Dafoe who always thinks more agents and equipment is better then Hackman's method of talking pleasantly to people to get the truth without the town turning on him.I could go on and on about this movie and the more I want to write the more I know the longer this is the less it'll be read. So I'll leave you with this, there are very few movies that leave you with a lasting impression and this is one that'll I'll be watching again and again.",Mississippi Burning

119,vinnieboards,Tension versus Schmaltz - what would you choose?,10,17 December 2010,"Mississipi Burning will always be remembered for one of the greatest injustices delivered in modern history.Whilst no one can deny that Rainman and the performances, especially from Dustin Hoffman are top draw,it is not a patch on Mississippi Burning and yet Rainman cleaned up at the Oscars against this magnificent movie's expense. A travesty of justice but not a surprise.Once again (as with Forrest Gump), schmaltz wins the day. And yet as a piece of movie making, Mississippi Burning is one of the best I've seen for many years.The shocking and brutal way the movie unravels the story of racist bigotry in the Deep South during the Sixties is at times incredibly difficult to watch. Yet watch you will, due in part to a magnificent acting performance from Gene Hackman, backed up by a career best performance from Wilem DeFoe.Hackman & Defoe basically want the same thing - justice for some activists who have gone missing and who they suspect have been murdered. The only problem being that their methods are poles apart - Defoe does everything by the book whilst Hackman does the opposite using intimidation to divide the tight lipped community.The film is both moving and educational (and brave!) It is based on a true story and I don't really care how true the film is to this story or indeed how there may be certain historical inaccuracies or flaws. As a single coherent piece of cinema the film delivers in abundance. Even the ending whilst positive, is not euphoric and again highlights the bigotry and corruption around at the time. Many of these protagonists are spared jail but you at least get the feeling that it's 'a start'.This is not a 'feel good' film and was never meant to be. But the acting and imagery of this piece lasted longer in my memory than Rainman which whilst good, is too sentimental and gushing at times.Conclusion? Gritty, tension laden films win over schmaltz every single time.",Mississippi Burning
120,driver_8,A Movie Classic,10,11 June 2004,"I know that many historians have been critical of this film. They point to the fact that this was not a factual re-telling of the actual incident. Man, they don't get it. This was a movie. It was based on an actual incident, but in the end, it was a movie. As a movie, it portrays the South and the issue of racism better than any movie before it. Director Parker creates excellent characters that embody the different perspectives of those that were involved in the civil rights crisis. Whether it is the idealist FBI agent portrayed by DeFoe or the Southern FBIrealist so brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. This movie shows us why peopletried to change the South and why other people tried to preserve that South. The result is a violent and disturbing film, which both educates and entertains. OK, the FBI actually used huge cash payoffs to get Klan members to testify against others in the real case. No, the FBI did not have a black agent that helped them to crack the case.

This movie sets precedents for bringing to the limelight of how society was just 44 years ago (26 years ago when this movie was made). It's amazing to see how tolerant we have become in just a short period of time. This movie really speaks it's mind and holds nothing back. The acting is superb and the plot is one that can keep me interested up until the end. They don't make many movies like Mississippi Burning. Some part in this film are just so utterly powerful, it's hard to find any bad things about it. Willem Dafoe gives it his all, and he's a great actor. Of course Gene Hackman is very convincing as the tough agent whos morals outweigh his dedication to the FBI. If you are going to make some sort of statement in a movie, this is the best way I can think to do it. By simply making it a high powered, entertaining motion picture, your message can be widely accepted by its viewer and therefore making your statement known and clear.

The cast is led by an impressive Gene Hackman and his co-star a very young William Defoe,as two FBI agents who travel to Mississippi to investigate. this is a very disturbing film and quite horrific in parts due to the fact that it is loosely based on a real event. The level of hatred portrayed was also disturbing because it happened less than forty years ago and in some places In the deep American south such feelings still apply. Although the film is very bleak, the end of the movie does give the viewer hope. The sight of white and black citizens standing together shoulder to shoulder at a funeral actually made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. This film isn't an easy ride by any means but does move ,horrify and give hope in one breath. This movie thoroughly deserves 9/10",Mississippi Burning

This film, puts much into perspective and truly is an eye-opener that allows those of us who are detached from the film's setting a glimpse into what life was like at the time.From the very first scene it's tense and keeps you intrigued towards the outcome.As casting goes it's perfect, everyone depicts their roles well and adds to the whole theme both historically and emotionally. It also has a number of scenes that will make your blood boil and your skin crawl, but for me that's all part of the necessary roller-coaster of emotions that one would experience in order to appreciate this film and it's messageThis film may prove upsetting for some, but I would advise you to have a go. There have been many movies grounded around similar themes, and whilst most have been plausible I feel that this one is the pinnacle.

It never pulls a punch from frame one...you feel every bit of fear, anger, pain, frustration and outrage that radiates from the screen.   Hackman and Dafoe are remarkable as the two FBI agents Ward and Anderson...the tension between them is completely believable. Yet the most outstanding performances are given by two of the finest chameleon actors around; Frances McDormand (who garnered an Oscar for this film) and Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), both of whom are so complete in their work that it actually takes a moment to recognize them--you forget they are actors.

Attack On Teror really gave a better view in story line, than Mississippi Burning. These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act. I would encourage you all to get the real facts and watch Attack On Terror. You will get a better story, than this low budget movie.",Mississippi Burning

Two detectives are assigned to the case, amidst a backdrop of racial hatred and deceit. No one is willing to talk about what really happened that night on the lonely stretch of road.This movie is a must see, It portrays the south as it was in 1964 with great accuracy and honesty. Films like this need to be made, warts and all, that depict the racial ugliness of the time. Some people argue that stories like this should be sanitized, because they are too politically incorrect. I disagree, for this is how history was, and it needs to be shown in an accurate light, no matter how hard it is to watch.The two leads are great, particularly Willem Dafoe, as detective Ward who is determined that justice will be served, whether the crime victim is white or black.I found this movie to be honest and insightful, telling history as it really was.

I know whereof I speak.Therefore, let me say this: the events this film seeks to depict were bad enough without any inventions. But invent they did. Every local Black person in this movie is noble and a great singer. Their buildings, however, would lead you to believe they couldn't put tin on a roof straight. Why try to improve on facts? Every White person depicted in this film is an idiot. Out-houses in the sixties? KKK ruling the roost in an entire town?Where are the rich, educated, ""landed gentry"" who were behind all this violence, encouraging the rednecks with nods and winks? Not in this movie. But I know they exist, because I know some of them...a few who are still living. Mostly it is their children I know, who still feel the same way about Blacks, and still do the same encouraging of White trash.This film does not show how things really were. It seeks to make things look even worse, to people who don't know any better. It is a terrible story, with moments of good acting from many of the stars.

136,KDPeffley-2,An important movie to see,7,14 October 2021,"I was thirteen years old when the three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi, so my knowledge of what had really happened was scant to my memory. Had I known more about it, I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more. Currently, there several YouTube videos available for anyone who's interested in learning more about the background of the film, and you can read transcripts of the trials on the internet, even the confession of the informer. While the movie may not be perfectly aligned with how events actually played out, it does provide an vivid portrait of what it was like to live in Mississippi at that time: the absolute hegemony of white people over black people, perpetuated by violence and terror, along with social and economic inequality, not to mention the policies of segregation. It's certainly an important movie for us to see so that we can really understand how difficult the civil rights movement was for those that wanted to bring about change, and it can even help us to see how remnants of that period persist to this day. All this being said, I wish Mississippi Burning had been a better movie. Very little attention is given to how the KKK planned and executed these murders. And even though the focus of the story in the film was between the two FBI investigators, we are given only scant information how they were able to uncover the evidence that led to the trial, nor were we able to see the long term efforts of the government to convict these thugs, which led to sentences of only six years for only five or six of them. In other words, there's a lot more to the real life story than the film portrays, and given the rich amount of information that we now have, perhaps this could be better served as a Netflix mini series.",Mississippi Burning

Anyway, the only other movie from the hand of director Alan Parker that I remember watching was ""The Life of David Gale"" and to those out there who haven't seen it yet I strongly recommend not to witness this one and only Spacey nightmare because you will be sorry!Now let's focus on the good aspects. I still gave Mississippi burning a 6 because there are some powerful lines in the movie and the acting by Gene Hackman is outstanding. Frances McDormand looks really hot as usual (cfr. the major's secretary in Miller's Crossing - aaauwwwww aaauw aauw aaaaaaauuuuww babyyyyy !!!!). Another Ku Klux Klan tale seemed to me rather unoriginal at the beginning but there were some nice twists in the film which made it well worthy to be keeping track of what would happen next. I checked the movie on IMDb before I zapped to the right channel (as always) to have a look at the rating (7,5). I was so surprised by a promising cast (Willem Dafoe - Platoon, American Psycho, Brad Dourif - One flew over the cuckoos nest, Lee Ermey - Full Metal Jacket) and a whole list of ""official"" appreciations.

Of all the films about southern racial prejudice (In the Heat of the Night, Ghosts of Mississippi etc.) this one best presents the magnitude of ignorant hatred that existed within the South and the corruption of the white authorities. I find it interesting that I remember the names of Cheney, Schwerner and Goodman, but I don't remember the names of the SOBs that killed them. This film was slighted at the Academy Awards.

But now I really like it. Cuz it really shows the anatomy of hate. It dosen't just show that people hate it also clues you in on WHERE it comes from, kinda. And it's also a movie that ""feels real"". You can ""feel"" some of the characters in this movie, if that makes sense. Everybody did really great. The standout guy is the guy who played the preacher and when he gave that Disturbing ""Anglo Saxon Pride"" Speech. There are *TONS* of standouts parts in the movie, I'm sure some are bound to stick with you. The Interviews with the locals, especially that old white bi*** with her retarded views on certain races' hygienes, the bar where Gene Hackamn comes in and all the KKKmen stare at him disturbingly even as he jokes casually. The fact that all the patrons in the restaurant turn and stare and Gene and Will when they casually talk to the black dudes in there. And the part where the dude beats his wife up. And when the KKK guys show up out of the blue at the black church, call me corny, but I just envision something like that happening in MY church and get CH--ILLS,seriously. (yes I know I'm pathetic.) There were some corny and unbelievable parts,tho. I mean, for the most part it gives you the feel that it's really 1964. Not just a 1988 movie set in 1964. But the only exceptions is the part where the black guy kidnaps the mayor and interrogates him and threatens to cut his b*lls off if he dosen't talk. Um, not to be crass but to quote A Time To Kill: ""That (black man) would be hanging by a tree with HIS b**ls in his mouth"" if the white folks found about about that in those days!..ESPECIALLY in Mississiisppi! (no offense to the MS residence) And then the mayor hangs himself from all the guilt. I just can't PICTURE him doing that! That just SCREAMED UNBELIEABLE PC CORN!!! And showing the FBI as these superheroes coming down and actually giving a shyt about the blacks. Just ask the FBI LEADER Hoover, what he thought. He probably woulda said ""shoove 'em!"" I heard he even thought the Jew Guy Activist was a communist, so please. And the part where the black role is just a meek peasant who gets terrified by Kluckers and they just sit and sulk and preach about it....was...corny. I cared the LEAST about the black roles because of it. They were just there MAINLY to get terrorized and nothing else. It was like (think of an old silent movie): Black person rats *next scene* black persons' house gets blown up. *next scene* black family cries. *next scene* the two FBI agents get mad and THEY alone--do something.

It is set in the year 1964. It's about the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), black people, white people, a little town, agents and a lot of crime. There are the two FBI-agents Anderson and Ward. These two characters are played by the fabulous actors Gene Hackman (Anderson) and Willem Dafoe (Ward). They are the Hoover-Boys. Anderson is the older one and has rougher methods to solve a/this case and a long time ago he was a sheriff in Mississippi. Ward is the younger agent and he has the responsibility for this whole case, because it is his one. He only takes decisions which are in agreement with (the) law and the rules. The two have to find out who is the murderer of two whites and one black man. First they try this with Ward's methods. He demands a lot of agents. Ward looks for proof, asking questions and always obeying the law. When Ward realizes that his methods fail he needs Anderson's help. He tries to solve this case with rather unconventional methods. It works! After some time they catch the members of the Ku Klux Klan.MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a good film. Maybe not the newest one but good. It is a True Story resp. is based on a true story. Therefore it is a documentation too. It is an interesting film because after watching it you know (a bit) more about the Klu Klux Klan, differences between black and white at this time and so on.

146,avatara,The most powerful movie about racism,10,15 September 2000,"I am student in Sydney,Australia researching the civil rights movement of the 60s and this movie helps understand the racial tension, bigotry and violence prevailent in 1960s America. This is a totally different America from today with the ku klux klan terrorising neighbouring southern negros.This film, whilst often brutal, is a great depiction of this period, when crosses, churches and many negros' homes were burned.I have also come to believe that this film is based loosely on a true story, when the president of the USA dispatched a number of Federal Agents to search for 3 missing civil rights workers. This prompted one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.Gene Hackman is a former Southern Sheriff turned FBI, who teams up with a by-the-book agent Dafoe. Hackman is unorthodox by nature, and Dafoe continually wonders where the hatred comes from. ""Hatred is something that people are taught as soon as they are born"" - taught in schools basically, as the Deputys' wife says to Hackman.   Minor Spoiler:Soon, it is found that the sheriffs are part of the klan and are allegedly involved in the whole saga. Hackman's unorthodox methods are the ones that work, whilst Dafoe's methods do not. Hackman originally convinces Dafoe and they group with other agents to let fight back.

147,WindWoman3,Underestimated,10,11 August 2004,"Well, I guess this is why movies are so personal to the viewer.I've read some of the other comments here and have seen words like ""condescending"" and ""mediocre.""I couldn't disagree more. ""Mississippi Burning"" is an intellectually challenging movie. It demands that you immerse yourself in the worst of southern culture, whether you like it or not.Based on a true story, the film takes place in 1964 (my birth year, incidentally) in a small town ugly and virulent with racism. The good ol' boy sheriff and his stoolies ambush and in cold blood murder three civil rights workers. The world's a-changing, but the power-brokers in this place refuse to let that happen. They'll do anything to prevent blacks from taking their rightful place at the table - literally.The FBI sends a couple of mismatched agents in to search for the three missing young men. One agent (Hackman) is 'old school', sly, and knows his enemies a little too well. The other (Dafoe) is a naive Kennedy fire-eater, ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town's head. Although he is easy to underestimate at first, he grows into his role, showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.The relationship between the town's blacks and whites is complicated and fraught with rules - spoken and unspoken. It's a not-so-secret secret that the civil rights workers have been murdered. Hackman and Dafoe just have to get the bodies and the evidence, that's all. Fear and loathing prevent that from happening, until the wife of a deputy (the amazing Frances McDormand) throws herself on the fire and blows her slimy husband's alibi.There is justice - of a sort - in the end. It's not enough. Real change crawls on it's belly in the south.""Mississippi Burning"" is a movie of operatic gestures. The script is spongey with regional color and snappy, powerful dialogue.Hackman and McDormand are simply magical. They don't take or make a false step from the first frame to the last. As she would go on to prove in later films, McDormand doesn't just 'play' a character - she IS that character. And Hackman is never more affecting that in this film. One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor. Hackman is a national treasure.IMO, Dafoe is a well-meaning revelation until circumstances forces him to cave into Hackman's just-get-it-done ways. He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases, although that knowledge repulses him. He wants nothing more than to get out of the south and go home to a world he believes is cleaner and more simple.The conclusion of ""Mississippi"" is more bitter than sweet. The guilty are arrested and convicted, although their various punishments are a joke. (R. Lee Ermey is the only one in the bunch who meets a just fate.) McDormand is brutally beaten to within an inch of her life for betraying the status quo and doing the right thing. Although she and Hackman have fallen in love, she refuses to leave with him because ""this"" - gesturing to the vandalized ruins of the house she was born in - ""is my home.""I know the history, and I know this movie inside and out. And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it. The power of this film and the fact that ""Mississippi"" is based on ACTUAL EVENTS never fails to get to me.""Mississippi Burning"" has a place in my 'Top 50 Dramas.'",Mississippi Burning

Some subjects have been exploited for entertainment purposes, some of which have been grossly distorted to cheaply enhance the story. Mississippi Burning falls into neither camp, to question this movies subject, is to blindly deny that these atrocities ever took place. Alan Parker's engaging story is both respectful and non-judgemental.Gene Hackman takes centre stage during a time where he found quality roles difficult to come by, his Rupert Anderson a dogged, experienced veteran Mississippian whose instincts and social skills are essential to the task in hand. Willem Dafoe's young G-man, brash and over-confident brings the authority in an interesting role reversal. McDormand is the heart and humanity, while Brad Dourif looks suitably gleeful despite being the devil (McDormand and Dourif later played husband & wife again in 1991's Hidden Agenda). The rest of the supporting cast are excellent including Gailard Sartain, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Tobin (Jigsaw) Bell and Michael Rooker playing an even more sadistic SOB than Henry Lee Lucas.The story which does take dramatic licence but never loses it's nerve, held together expertly by Englishman Alan Parker. Parker is a Director who knows how to touch the darker recesses of the human condition. The cinematography is suitably Oscar-worthy.

Everyone's performances were not up to par, though Gene Hackman pretty much owns it as usual. Willem Dafoe was strangely incompetent. Frances McDormand's bad accent (as a southerner I really take umbrage at poor southern accents) left much to be desired. Everyone was drawn in (forgive the pun) black and white, and it just all felt so sophomoric. I feel like the heavy subject matter blinds people to its poor craftsmanship. I would like to see these events depicted again, but properly, and with all the facts. Because the truth was far uglier than this fictionalized brew could impart.",Mississippi Burning

But he doesn't get far. His investigation is blocked every step of the way by the locals, including law enforcement and the KKK. Clearly these Southern boys don't appreciate these 'bleeding heart liberals' coming down from the North and telling them how to 'treat their coloured folk'...The Gene Hackman comes along. He's another lawman, but with a more radical approach to investigation...Hackman's character is quite happy to do whatever it takes to achieve the desired objective including beating, threatening and intimidating witnesses and suspects. This approach is more successful...But will it prevail, in the face of opposition from (almost) the entire town?As usual, Dafoe is brilliant, and Hackman, of course never puts a foot wrong. He must have a really good agent, because I have never seen him act badly or be in a bad film.

154,touretteguy,Great! B.S. but great!!!,9,2 July 2004,"This film is spectacular. Too bad it's glorified nonsense. The FBI did not want to be in Mississippi in 1964. J. Edgar Hoover was a devout racist homophobe...ah hell he was a complete bigot. He was extremely reluctant to send agents down south to investigate 3 people he couldn't have cared less about. It was only under intense pressure that he finally caved. Furthermore, the agents are depicted in this as heroic & defenders of the peace & justice as if they were Jedi's or something. Southerners were not & still are not easily intimidated by outsiders. It is true that they respect authority, perhaps a little too much, but that's local & state authority not federal. It was actually the other way around. And if you don't believe that, then remember this, Southerners ran out the mafia during prohibition with their ultimate ways of dispatching one creatively. Southerners take great pride in running out Capone & his ilk by using such measures as sticking a guy to a post & stuffing his testicles in his mouth that were bitten off by a calf. Hence the reason the mafia shifted to Canada for their bootlegging.In spite of all that, I know how Hollywood likes to distort things for the purposes of entertainment & emotional interests. (i.e. KKK in ""A Time To Kill,"" ""Top Gun,"" etc.) So, taking that into consideration, this film was awesome! Willem Dafoe is pretty good but the highlight is Gene Hackman as he delivers yet again in a role reminiscent of his ""Popeye Doyle"" role! Even though it was pure hogwash, there are vital facts still in the story & to watch Hackman go to work on the guy from ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is classic & probably the inspiration for Russell Crowe's character in ""L.A. Confidential!"" Bottom line, my historical anal retentiveness put aside...9/10",Mississippi Burning
155,filmviewer64,"A touching, tragic, and superbly acted film concerning racism.",9,16 August 2007,"""Mississippi Burning"" has to be one of the greatest films I have scene to depict racism during the Civil Rights Era. Directed by Alan Parker and released in 1988, this film is without a doubt great at not only being a well acted drama concerning racism, but something of a thriller as well. Watching this movie is watching one of the most ingenious and emotional crime dramas to be made in the past twenty years, and perhaps even longer than that. All though it was overshadowed by ""Rain Man"" when it was released in 1988, that does not dampen just how impactive ""Mississippi Burning"" truly is.Based on the true account of three civil rights workers (two white and one black) being murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, the story follows fictional FBI agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) as they try to prove the culpability of Klan members in the murder. Do not expect this movie to closely follow exact history records, however, as you will end up being disappointed. Instead, the movie bases itself loosely in historical accuracy and shows the evils of racism in its own way. Still, many instances depicted in this movie really did happen, such as the KKK bombing the houses and churches of black people, but actual names, places, and dates are not adhered by. Actually, though, I think it was wise for the movie not to adhere itself so close to history, as it gives the film more to work with.A popular criticism of ""Mississippi Burning"" is that it makes the federal agents look more like heroes to Civil Rights workers than they actually were. I can agree with that point to an extent in the film, but with the great performances the movie gives, you should not be wasting time on noticing that issue. Gene Hackman gives off another superb performance in this movie as federal agent Rupert Anderson, who I feel should go down as one of cinema's greatest law enforcement individuals. In the movie Anderson is actually from Mississippi himself, where he worked as a town sheriff. Due to this, Anderson knows how things work in the South concerning crimes against Civil Rights Workers and black people, and is not afraid to get his hands dirty to see a crime get solved. Anderson often clashes with his by-the-book boss, Ward, because of this. As for Willem Dafoe's portrayal of federal agent Ward, it is solid, but sometimes it is overdone with ""good guy"" themes. Even though I am sure that there were FBI agents that wanted to help with the Civil Rights cause, would any FBI agent in that time period really be allowed to bring down over a hundred federal agents and men from the naval reserves (as he does) into Mississippi in order to help solve a murder case? Unlikely, but as I said, to quibble on such a menial matter is to lose sight of the grand scope of the film.Another stand-out performance in the movie is given off by Frances McDormand as the quiet, subdued, and seeming battered wife of town deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), and the owner of a beauty parlor. Clinton Pell is a member of the KKK himself, and even participated in the shootings of the three Civil Rights workers. Playing this man's wife, McDormand shows how her character truly disapproves of everything her husband stands for, but is simply too scared or perhaps does not think enough of herself to break free of his violent domination. She plays a very important part in the movie with one Anderson, but I should not spoil anymore of the plot for those that have never seen the film. Many will argue that characters like Clinton Pell are over-exaggerated for the time, but that is not true, as even today I can find men and woman who share many of his same thoughts.Along with the tremendous acting comes excellent cinematography. Every shot wonderfully captures the look and feel of a small Mississippi town in that age, with dusty streets, small diners, general stores, farms, and houses (some ramshackle, some nice). Camera work in this film makes you feel that you are in Mississippi yourself.My review of this movie simply does not do the film any justice. One must watch the movie to feel all of the strong emotions within it. Upon my initial viewing of this film, I was shaken and disturbed by the racism that is presented. It was smart for this movie to not preach how racism is evil, but to simply show racism in its purest form and allow the viewer to be the judge.Like I have said throughout this review, some minor issues plague ""Mississippi Burning"". Those minor issues are what made me give this movie nine stars instead of ten. Still, I recommend this movie very highly, and even with some of its minor flaws, if you have any sense of what a good movie is it will surely capture you with assets that definitely outweigh the flaws.",Mississippi Burning

158,bigdays99-1,Domestic Terrorism,9,16 March 2008,"The movie ""Mississippi Burning"" is the story of two FBI agents investigating the murder of three civil right workers in Mississippi in 1964. The tactics used by the perpetrators included hangings, burning barns, churches, livestock, and homes. The locals intimidated the blacks who they believed were cooperating with the FBI, instilling scare tactics to terrify them into avoiding the agents. The more the FBI tried to gain information, the more the violence escalated. The sheriff's office was involved in the terror and used it to maintain their power. They were bullies, believing their behavior was justified. They wouldn't tolerate opposition. Everyone involved was responsible, even the mayor, who one agent pointed out wasn't ""in on it"" yet Agent Ward reciprocated by saying his knowledge of the incident was enough to involve him. Agent Ward was baffled at the behavior of the locals, being a naïve, straight-arrow D.C. agent while Agent Anderson was realistically unsurprised, having been raised in northern Mississippi.The mutation of the FBI tactics in the investigation was the most thought provoking part of the movie. Agents Ward and Anderson were on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. Ward was trying to be polite and accomplish goals by the book while Anderson was a street-smart, unorthodox, fearless, and empathetic agent. At first, they sought and expected cooperation from the sheriff; that never happened. Their questioning of the black community was met with resistance. Agent Anderson established a rapport with Deputy Pell's wife. He sensed her overwhelming desire to break away, yet she was at first reluctant to help, being a dutiful wife and southern woman, but eventually became an informant. Anderson had no qualms assaulting one of the members at their ""social club"", letting them know early on that he didn't take kindly to threats.There were two very pivotal points in the movie that made the FBI change its tactics, even to the point of Agent Ward growing a backbone and adopting some of Anderson's philosophies. First was organizing a ""secret meeting"" of the key members in a church. When they realized it was a set up and bailed, Lester ignorantly spilled and the FBI quickly took advantage of his vulnerability. As Agent Anderson put it, ""the rattlesnakes were beginning to commit suicide"". The story took a very dramatic turn when Deputy Pell's wife finally broke down and identified the location of the bodies. After the discovery and processing, the sheriff insisted Pell settle the ""problem at home"", even sending 3 fellow members to watch over Pell violently assault his wife for her betrayal. They had finally struck a vital nerve with the FBI and Anderson was finished relying on Ward's protocol. Ward's pressed-suit, pen-and-paper, rookie agents were out and Anderson's seasoned, no-nonsense ""fixer"" agents were in. I found an interesting correlation in the FBI measures to the perpetrator's. They spared no expense for a desired outcome, to include a rouse hanging of Lester, an extremely coercive interrogation of the mayor in a desolate shack, and, my favorite scene of the entire movie, Agent Anderson's retaliation against Deputy Pell at a barber shop, asking Pell if ""he struck a blow for the white man"" the night he killed the civil rights workers as well as the night he remorselessly beat his wife.I believe the FBIs tactics, although unorthodox, were justified. They tried to play it by the book and it didn't work. Perhaps they pushed the envelope to gain results but justice prevailed. Agents Ward and Anderson learned a thing or two about each other and the ethics of ""bureau procedure"".",Mississippi Burning
159,kaischammakhi,"Strong, provoking and beautifully directed",9,8 June 2018,"This film takes place in the 60s, in the state of Mississipi, known for its ruthless discrimination suffered by the black people. Two FBI officers investigtate the mysterious disappearance of three civil rights activists, one is a young idealistic college kid (played by Willem Dafoe) under whom works a middle-aged man who's an ex-sheriff and was born and raised in a small Mississippi town (played by Gene Hackman).
Now this plot may seem a bit ordinary these days even back in the day with many films addressing the same subject like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) and the beloved To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), but this film takes it to another level with its incredible acting, good writing and beautiful directing.
The actors made me enjoy this movie, especially Gene Hackman, seriously this man is a legend, supported by a promising Dafoe and a young Frances McDormand. The contrast between the leading actors made the film pleasant to watch as they gave satisfying performances.

162,Markhoysted,Great acting and directing ...but a severely compromised script.,7,24 September 2005,"THE FILM: The third of Parker's 80's heyday films following Birdy and Angel Heart,Mississippi Burning is an acting masterclass.From Hackman and Defoe in the leads to all the supporting cast. As per usual it looks great and has some strong images. For all this it gets 7 out 10.THE STORY: Is based on the real events of the murder of 3 civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi and the subsequent FBI investigation into their deaths. The problem is not with the ongoing story of how the Fed's crack the case.This is fiction based on fact and as a police story it works fine.THE COMPROMISE: 1, the FBI. J.Edger Hoover in 1964 was possibly the most powerful man in the country, with a file on everyone of importance or power.The FBI was his private fiefdom. Mr.Hoover believed Martin Luther King was a Communist and had no sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement.This is mentioned in one small line of script.The Bureau would have to go after murderers but was certainly on no crusade. Mr.Hoover detested the Kennedys and only kept his job because he had enough info to destroy them.So how the Defoe character, as a Kennedy man , got beyond a filing job is hard to say. Mr.Hoover used Hollywood to create the myth of the G-man ,this myth is still alive and kicking in this film.The Gene Hackman character had been a Mississippi sheriff and obviously part of a Bureau dirty tricks squad and we are expected to believe he has a bleeding heart under his badge. What would have made it interesting if his character was more truthful.The FBI was an all white agency and it certainly was not politically correct.Mr Hoover's views were no secret so rascism would certainly not effect anybody'career.Again this is hinted at in his speech about his father. 2,the KKK, It seems the whole white community in the South is a member which oversimplifies the situation a lot. Also, it does not show the main cause of the hatred was the Southern establishment,the wealthy landowners who encouraged the politicians,the police and judiciary to preach segregation as a classic measure of divide and rule of the poor- whites and African-Americans. It also ignores the fact that segregation had been twisted into the very fabric of the Southern states post- Confederacy identity. 3,the African-Americans, The docile passivity,gospel singing over ashes of churches and the lack of anger is patronising in the extreme.The Civil rights movement was born in South and the churches were its most vocal advocates.Maybe if this film had been made in the 70's rather than the 80's these major background issues would not have been ignored.",Mississippi Burning

166,tdibug,"mediocre and predictable, but Hackman excels",3,3 November 2003,"I cannot comment on how closely this film tracked to the real life events that it supposedly follows. But as a movie, it falls short of it's potential by lapsing into the preachy and stereotypical Hollywood style which has become so commonplace in today's cinema. I doubt there are many souls left today who would deny that the KKK did some horrific things, or that there wasn't a pervasive racist culture in the South in the early 60's. But if there are, this movie tries to dispel all remaining skeptics with the subtlety of a lead balloon. By trying to tie up hatred and bigotry into one neat little package (by compartmentalizing and homogenizing groups of people), the movie fails in a rather big way. I mean, how many times have we been fed the message that all southerners are ignorant racists, that all blacks are innocent bystanders barely capable of controlling their own destinies, or that liberal educated whites are the saviors of the human race. Hardly original (or truthful).Beyond the problem of the ""message"", the movie has other faults. William Dafoe just isn't, in my opinion, believable at all. From his overly done ""Kennedy-esque"" appearance to his constant idealistic waning (the obvious target being the ""uneducated audience""), his authenticity never rings true. And did dozens upon dozens of FBI agents really wade into the Mississippi swamps without regard for their expensive suits? Well, if they did, perhaps it just shows that educated Northern white boys aren't that smart after all! Finally, if director Alan Parker's intent was to leave us in the lurch regarding Anderson's and Mrs. Pell's ""relationship"", he succeeded with flying colors.On a positive note, Gene Hackman's performance is excellent. He holds it all together....well, he IS the movie. His delivery, mannerisms and character make Mississippi Burning quite enjoyable to watch from a cinematic point of view.

It is a sad commentary on western society that even during the 'swinging sixties' this kind of behaviour was tolerated.The courage of Mrs. Pell, the sheer bloody-mindedness of Anderson to achieve a conviction, and the weary acceptance of Ward that to achieve conviction some corners had to be cut, is still as pertinent today as it was when the film was set.

Directed by British director Alan Parker(Birdy,Angel Heart) it focuses on two contrasting FBI agents. One is Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe), you and idealistic, and the other Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman) is older and shrewder. Both men want to solve the case,but their different styles mean that they keep butting heads. Anderson, a Southerner,understands the people.He may not be a racist himself, but he knows what motivates people. The story he tells Ward about an incident in his childhood is very telling. He is fully aware about what is right and wrong. Ward on the other hand, is confused by the actions of Southerners.He actually says""What is wrong with these people?"" which highlights his anger and frustration.In many ways, this is Hackman's film. He fully deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor.Parker does not skimp on the violence, he shows you just how cruel the Ku Klax Klan can be in their use of terror. Churches are burnt down and people are beaten. Unlike the recent film Selma, the violence is not watered down. We also have a sub plot of Anderson getting close to one of the local women by played by future Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Her husband Brad Dourif's Deputy Pell may actually be part of the Ku Klux Klan. Look out for small parts from Tobin Bell, Frankie Faison,Michael Rooker and Park Overall.If I have one complaint about this film, it is that it does not have a proper black character.

Sure, Gene Hackman was great, but you pretty much expect that from him, and Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar Nomination; but Sartain really stood out as the sheriff. He managed to be compelling and charismatic and scary as hell all at the same time. Actually, so did Gene Hackman, which I think was intentional--the filmmakers wanted us to notice the very thin line between Hackman's ex-sheriff character and Sartain's Sheriff Stuckey.I thought the movie was a little heavy-handed, and its obvious attempts to be powerful and moving made me wince at times. But maybe that was necessary to portray just how dangerous and vicious racism can be when it ingrains itself into a culture. Overall, I would highly recommend this film.",Mississippi Burning
171,General-Romanov,"A sad story, A great Movie",9,10 February 2008,"Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.",Mississippi Burning

In a similar way I thought his performance in ""The Chamber"", whilst being only an average film, was amazing.All that being said, I felt that criticisms of the film itself are totally justified. Mississippi Burning portrays the blacks as weak camera-fodder victims seemingly without any involvement in any fight for civil liberties, and the portrayal of white FBI as Liberation fighters for the Black cause, who themselves instigated the end of American 'apartheid'!

It touched my whole class so much and we we're so ""shocked and disgusted at our own race"". One of the girls was sick at the thought that anyone could be so heartless. We just couldn't and still cant understand the hatred that drove these people into such anger.At the moment we're briefly looking at the KKK and I'm trying to almost get a grasp on the reason they feel like this.Its so hard to even think like this because I'm not a racist person by any stretch and I'm feeling like I'm almost condoning what their doing.But i supposed thats life isn't it",Mississippi Burning
176,zzinser,Fabulous,8,8 August 2003,"Mississippi Burning is one of my favorite Gene Hackman movies.  I remember watching it when I was young, it was one of the few rated R movies my parents would allow me to watch.  Such a powerful story about the disappearance of three civil rights workers down in rural Mississippi. When the Feds are called in to investigate the disappearance, the action really heats up.  Dafoe is perfect in playing the FBI agent opposite Hackman. Hackman is the charming, funny, and very smart to whats happening around him.  Not that he doesnt care what he's down there for, but he's taking in the surroundings, he knows how these people operate.  Dafoe is quite the opposite.  Strict, by the book agent who seems to take it more seriously. Dafoe's character seems to be in shock of what's going on around him, but Hackman seems to know exactly whats wrong.  Great suspense, and a great depiction of this time in history, when being black in the South might get you killed.  Based on a true story.",Mississippi Burning
177,lpelljr,"Magical Black People, OH MY!",5,10 November 2005,"I appreciate the comments of the other users who have seen this film. But this film should make you angry for one reason and one reason only, that the FBI, the most volatile opponent of Civil Rights Workers, actually turn out the good guys. Mississippi Burning started the disturbing mini- genre of mainstream films exploring the atrocities of racism through the eyes of people who were the least offset by it., the white male. To cite prime examples of this genre where the plight of the African -American is used as a tool for the White character's growth or change. The Green Mile, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Places in the Heart, And most heinously, Ghosts of Mississippi,(where a great opportunity to tell the story of the amazing leader Medgar Evers is wasted to tell the story of the White lawyer who brought his murderer to justice. Is that why he died? Is that why he did all that work to free his people from oppression? Is that why he sacrificed his life to make sure that the white lawyer get's his props in a Hollywood movie?) are part of this legacy of having Black character's be the catalyst for the growth of the white people they come into contact. As if they don't bleed blood, but magical pixie-dust to enlighten the white masses.It's this UN-focused liberalism that taints Mississsippi Burning. The argument of the writer's taking creative license with the historical facts to make a more compelling mystery is pointed, but the callousness of the Producer's hyping it as a socially- responsible, ""important "" film is just flat-out ridiculous. The film works as well as it can as a hard-boiled mystery, and is masterfully acted by Hackman, MacDormand, and Defoe, but Alan Parker is not known for his subtlety, and the villains of the piece are just so inherently evil, rather than being portrayed as just the sad, scary,ignorant, tragic hicks they were.",Mississippi Burning
178,hi55us,Great movie,10,10 April 2006,"Burning Mississippi is a very motivational and inspiring movie about the civil rights movement in the south. This movie displays a very negative image of the Ku Klux Clan (KKK) and it shows the brutality of their actions in the 1950's and 60's. In the beginning the movie demonstrated how the mindset was in the state of Mississippi. The movie introduces this mindset through FBI agent Anderson. Anderson has no respect for the black people in the south and believes that the state has just concerns in the segregation of Negroes. Anderson's boss Allen Ward disagrees with his philosophy and he sees everyone equal. The two Agents are sent to Mississippi to uncover what happened to three boys earlier in the month, two of the boys where white and one was black, which made the case very interesting. Agent Anderson saw the case as a simple ""missing persons"" case where as Allen Ward sees it as a full-investigation and a big case. At first in the movie the Depute and the County Sheriff see the two FBI agents as idiots and showed them no respect. All they told the agents is that they where released from the police department at nine o'clock and they did not hear from them since.",Mississippi Burning
179,erik-crone-79,A classic and one of my top 10,10,17 July 2013,"A good movie for me can be anything that makes me laugh, cheer, cry, or think. I just need to be entertained at least. This said; I enjoy popcorn flicks like Starship Troopers all the way to deep flimsy stuff like The Thin Red Line. This movie contains brilliant acting of some of the best actors of the late 1900. Add to that an awesome score by the epic Trevor Jones and you get this excellent movie that will give you a ""good time"" for sure!Now the theme of the movie isn't very uplifting (and maybe not even 100% historically accurate) but it is nonetheless, sadly, still a thing for us today to think about and remember how we were, how we are, and how we want to be.See it!",Mississippi Burning
180,sk8_4_life_89,The Movie is Awesome,10,22 February 2005,"This movie was spectacular since it delivered a message to everyone who watched the horrible crimes that were being committed to the people and their race. In this movie, you basically cannot stop watching after the first few minutes because it shows everyone who is watching that some civil rights workers were murdered in their own car by policemen, or sheriff. This movie is the best I have seen and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to watch suspense movies filled with crime and drama. Just from watching this movie in school, I have realized that nowadays, the racism part in our world is not as bad as before, although we still have to stop racists. This movie delivers a message, and is definitely on the top of my list. GO Watch it!",Mississippi Burning
181,kenny6774,The nature of hate...,8,26 February 2005,"I just finishing watching the movie...wasn't able to see it in it's entirety. But nonetheless the movie was incredibly moving. I found myself compelled from time to time screaming at the TV. As an African-American I also found a brief but poignant hatred of ""white people"" take over me. But I came to my senses and reflected on the fact that good and evil exist in every human being...that every white person wasn't a racist and that some whites had the courage to find against injustice. Just as every black person isn't a saint and can be complicit in wrong doing. I questioned whether or not I would be a racist had I been born white in the South. I thought about the role of courage and the need to stand up for what's right even when the status quo is different. I have always been fascinated by the nature of hate...and how it can lead people to do such horrendous things (whoever they are). I think about slavery and the Holocaust as cliché but important examples. I'm sorry this review is less about the movie and more about the thoughts it provoked in me. Overall, I thought it was a GREAT movie and is worth everyone seeing. I'm glad that we've advanced as a society and a world community, but we have so far to go. If God exists may he be with us.",Mississippi Burning
182,nico-86241,The movie is about two FBI agents on a hunt for members of the racist KKK group that may be among them,8,15 December 2015,"Great movies are ones that give you a strong emotional response whether you can relate to the movie or not. From little things such as camera angles to costume to using lighting on someone's face in just the right way. However this movie is very violent and some people might not want to watch the harsh and brutal reality. This is what makes the movie come to life and for you to know what people went through, if they kept the violence out they wouldn't have got their point across as well as they did. I very much enjoyed this film and is one of the best I've seen The acting in this film was amazing and I think they made a good decision on picking the actors they did. They picked actors that somewhat look like the men from the real life story. They also picked actors by just looking at them they had a strong presence of hatred. I really liked the good cop bad cop aspect and having two FBI agents that have totally different styles. For example Anderson is very charming, easy to talk to and relaxed. You can even tell this by his costume, loose tie non ironed shirt and he does not often wear a suit jacket. On the other hand Ward is very serious and isn't friendly with his witnesses. His costume is very stiff, clean cut and always wears a part in his hair and a full suit jacket at all times. The only thing I think the makers of the film could have made better was the structure or the outcome of the story line. Right from the beginning you know what is going to happen by the end of the film. However it is an ending that can sit right with everyone. I think they took the safe route by not switching up the storyline just to make the viewers happy. If they were to make a not so predictable ending that would make the media talk more about the film. The best part of the film is the cinematography and lighting. For example using lighting from the bottom of the actors faces to make people look more evil and sinister. The director also did a lot of making certain characters more superior by filming the actor they want to have power in the scene up higher so they look in charge. Lastly they made the lighting darker for the very brutal parts such as killing to give it a creepy evil vibe while still keeping it appropriate to put in a film.Mississippi burning had its own type of music like building up (i.e. car chase) music that continues to get louder and more intense the more it goes on. Once something brutal and awful is happening there is soulful gospel music. Even when nothing is happening or no actor is saying there lines, if you listen close you can always here the noise of crickets in the background.In conclusion I would give this film 4 stars out of 5. The cinematography and lighting was amazing, same with the music and actors. However the storyline's outcome was to predicable and they could have made the outcome more shocking.",Mississippi Burning
183,ceejaykaygee05,Mississippi was burning,10,7 August 2005,every time i see this movie it makes my blood boil. it was a great movie i can never watch it with dry eyes. this movie makes you think and hope that the world has changed and to think that i am a black female married to a white man in the south it doesn't bother me as much as it did before i married him. if i could change the world i would thanks for this great movie for. there has not been a movie that can come anywhere near this one and i wish there had been a follow up to show what Mississippi is like today. the cast in this movie was great and there was a lot of stars made from this movie i can't seem to type this either with a dry eyes to the writer and all the people that made this movie thank you so very much.,Mississippi Burning
184,RockDaze,Great Movie,9,20 August 2005,"This was a great movie that shows the South of the USA for what it really is. Hollywood doesn't just pick on the South when it comes to supremacists, e.g. American History X, but if you want to see another great south bashing movie watch Ezy Rider. There is a reason that movies usually show the south as a scary place, because it is. For starters it produced the Bush family.I can't believe that Miss it didn't win more awards in 88' it should of bested Rain Man in some aspects.Amazing how Hackman can just change in and out of roles so easily, Dafoe is good as well, both actors are very believable and convey their characters well. This is probably my favorite of Alan Parkers work. Although I love Plink Floyd The Wall, but that probably because I love the band.",Mississippi Burning
185,dolzo,Very Good Movie,8,30 August 2005,"I thought Mississippi Burning was a very well constructed movie that dealt with some very big issues.These issues included racism, violence and segregation, all of which were very relevant to when and where the movie was set, in Mississippi in 1964.The issues were cleverly conveyed through the characters, where viewers created certain opinions and attitudes of them from their speech, their actions, their appearance, and other characters comments and actions about them. If we had a positive attitude towards a character for instance Agent Ward we valued the issues he valued and rejected the issues he rejected and so on.I thought the movie was very good and taught me about the situation that people were faced with in southern America in that era.",Mississippi Burning
186,sanski88,Overview on Mississippi Burning,7,1 September 2005,"Mississippi Burning Directed by Alan Parker, Mississippi Burning (1988) tells the story about a small town turned upside down by the FBI coming there to investigate the disappearance of three young men. The movie deals with harsh reality of racism in the South of USA. It is set in 1964 when racial segregation blossomed and blacks were seen as a lower class. The movie evokes sympathy and knowing that it's based on true story and true events it really gets the viewer thinking: ""How could these things have happened?"" The main characters are the two agents from the North of USA investigating the crime and the members of the Ku Klux Klan. The agents are very different from each other but have the same goal to solve the crime. Through the investigations the truth of the widely spread violence committed against the blacks by the white racists is revealed to the agents. The difference between the North and the South is highlighted as the agents are using methods that question the traditional cultural norms in solving the crime, like interviewing the black people. Another interesting character in the movie is Mrs Pell, wife of a sheriff who is a member of Ku Klux Klan. Mr Anderson, the other agent and her go through interesting conversations in the movie. Mrs Pell, like most white people in the town is brought up teaching that whites a better people than blacks. She says hate isn't born it's taught. In the end the killers are caught and they are convicted to prison.",Mississippi Burning

188,liammac2005,"Excellent, incredibly enthralling",9,24 November 2005,"I watched this film because of it's relevance to my GCSE course, in which we are doing the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" which is very similar to this film and my teacher thought it would help to see this. The acting was incredible, I can't think of any weaknesses, both lead roles were performed brilliantly throughout.The violence was graphic to say the least, and may be a bit harsh for some, but it all added to the effect the film had in that the audience was involved with the storyline emotionally. The parts of the film which showed violence towards the negroes were well acted and realistic, the ""interrogation"" of one of the white actors was superb.The ending was abrupt, almost disappointing, the film seemed to lead to a climax which surely should have been deeply emotional and active but it seemed the director had given up and couldn't be bothered. Other than that, great film.",Mississippi Burning
