0,Leofwine_draca,Semi-successful variant on the classic story,5,29 December 2017,"VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN is another Hollywood attempt to go back to horror's classic routes, and the good news is that it's better than the overblown VAN HELSING and the silly I, FRANKENSTEIN, two previous outings I didn't have much luck with. That doesn't make it perfect, however. I found this just about watchable but that's as far as it goes. The 'hook' is that the film's central figure isn't Frankenstein but rather his hunchbacked servant Igor, an important figure in the Universal classic THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN but one who has been neglected in recent years. Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor in a semi-successful performance although he seems to think he's in a more comedic film than those around him. James McAvoy is Frankenstein himself and better, with his usual intensity. The film generally keeps you watching to a degree, although I found it to be lacking in many memorable moments aside from the OTT climax.",Victor Frankenstein
1,SnoopyStyle,I like Igor,5,18 September 2016,"Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) starts out as a nameless hunchback in a circus. He studies anatomy when he isn't abused as a freak in the show. He pines for trapeze artist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay). She falls and he comes to the rescue performing a daring surgery on the spot. Unconventional medical student Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) is amazed by his skills and helps him escape from the circus. Victor gives him the name of his late friend and drains the cyst on his back curing him of being a hunchback. Victor is experimenting on reanimation. Igor meets Lorelei later and she's amazed by his change. Victor reanimates a chimpanzee and gains the support of his arrogant classmate Finnegan (Freddie Fox) while police detective Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott) aims to stop him.This is another remake of the classic story. It tries to be flashy as well as a period piece. The story is unnecessarily overstuffed. I like Radcliffe, McAvoy and even Scott. I really like this origin story for Igor but the movie runs too long and flounders. Instead of moral conflicts, Lorelei should be kidnapped sooner forcing Igor to act. The story can climax quicker in a more powerful way. The movie keeps going and going with flashy electricity and explosions. Everybody is over-emoting during the climax and the monster is just a monster. Victor's change about the monster doesn't quite have it. He's simply looking into the monster's face and determines that his brother isn't there. It's not enough to have the magical face-off. It needs something. It needs a talisman or a memory. Victor has to realize that his brother isn't there by some actual thing that the monster can't comprehend. It's a lot of flash and bang trying to cover for a less than adequate resolution.",Victor Frankenstein
2,Prismark10,"Igor, get me the parts",5,8 October 2016,"This is a campy reimagining of the Frankenstein story set as a bromance between Dr Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) a radical visionary scientist, planning to reanimate a dead beast whose body parts he has been stealing and Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) a deformed clown from the circus and a self taught medic. Victor rescues him from the circus and realising Igor's potential and also diagnosing the cause of his deformity sets him up to conduct part of his experiments before revealing the full extent of what he is up to.Pursuing them is detective Turpin, a god fearing man who senses Frankenstein plans do defy god's law.An interesting attempt to do something with the Frankenstein story which falls flat in the middle before livening up a little at the end.",Victor Frankenstein
3,mark.waltz,Introducing the picture example of where good intentions lead.,4,24 March 2017,"A story told more times than this has needed to be, it is proof to me that the alterations to the plots of classic literature is as wrong as messing with nature. James McAvoy is Victor Frankenstein, rescuing abused hunchback Daniel Radcliffe and renaming him Igor after de-humping him by removing the liquid from a severe growth. He knows that the newly monikered Igor is a genius when it comes to medical procedures and utilizes him in his bizarre scientific experiments. It's up to the moral Igor to stop McAvoy from going too far, which is an understatement considering his plans.Starting off perfectly fine, this quickly descends into predictable melodrama and noisy, dizzifying camera work, and even a disturbing creature I can only refer to as Frankenchimp. Not giving you moments to think or breathe, it goes right back to the issues of 1994's ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" which tried too hard to engage its audiences through visual tricks.Looking like Vincent Price at the height of his American International. Edgar Alan Poe era, McAvoy is far too intense, melodramatic and yet not quite camp. Radcliffe manages to be subtle and seems to be trying to tone what the legend of Igor was, much like the melodramatic manner that Robert De Niro attempted to play the creature. It just gets to be too much rushed together, and even with the look of authenticity towards the setting never really completely gels.",Victor Frankenstein
4,claudio_carvalho,Weird Movie,5,16 July 2017,"""Victor Frankenstein"" is a weird movie using Mary Shelley's notorious and famous character. There are many versions of this adaptation of the novel to the cinema, but this one rewrites the story in a totally different situation. The result is entertaining and intriguing in the beginning but becomes boring and annoying in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Victor Frankenstein""",Victor Frankenstein
5,nogodnomasters,"LIED TO BY YOU, HUNTED BY THE POLICE, AND CHASED BY MONSTERS",10,7 May 2018,"This is an interesting retelling of the classic horror tale, taking place in late 19th century London through the eyes of Igor Strassman,(Daniel Radcliffe) which would make for an uninteresting title. Igor starts out as a circus hunchback whose medical skills and genius is recognized by Dr. Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy). His rescue from the circus involved a ruckus and a death, which is being investigated by Scotland Yard detective Rafferty (Bronson Webb) who puts together an unbelievable report of ""high society hunchback and undead monsters.""The film is also theme and theologically loaded with numerous statements such as Victor Frankenstein proclaiming, ""God has no authority here"" while being warned ""There is no mercy in nature."" The film also discusses Victor's past, need for a financial benefactor, and Igor having a love interest (Jessica Brown Findlay.) This brings in more characters, turning the feature into a drama with moments of dark humor and horror.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Monster horror.There are numerous wisps within the film that are references to previous Frankenstein films that may go unnoticed such as the mispronunciation of the name as was done in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. The name Rafferty for the Scotland Yard detective immediately brought to mind the song ""Baker Street"" by Gerry Rafferty which was also the residence of Sherlock Holmes.",Victor Frankenstein
6,kosmasp,Different view,7,20 October 2016,"Does that mean that it's better than others? Maybe not, but maybe you are looking for a new way of telling a story that you are familiar with. Some do not like this, others really cherish the way this movie went. And it's up to the viewer to decide what he wants from a Frankenstein movie. A theme that I'm pretty sure everyone watching has heard of at least, before watching the movie.Since I haven't read the novel, I'm not sure if some of the ""changes"" are already in the book, but weren't used before in other adaptations. Both main actors are really good and convey the characters they portray. With all their flaws and downfalls, with all their dreams and hopes. Whether you agree with those or not, this is more than a decent effort and a really good movie",Victor Frankenstein
7,Sleepin_Dragon,A creative retelling of a classic.,7,30 August 2020,"It's the story of Professor Frankenstein and his creation as you'd expect, but it's primarily the study of Igor, his man servant, we get his history, his present, and a glimpse into his future.It's a very good film, it's very nicely made, beautifully acted, it's a very nice gothic drama. I would argue it's not a horror as the classification states, if you are wanting lots of Monster action there isn't a great deal of that, what there is looks fantastic.Great special effects, particularly at the dramatic finale, it looks terrific.Not sure which of the two was billed as the star of the show, maybe an equal billing, but Radcliffe is excellent. I love how on occasion you hear McAvoy's wonderful Scottish accent peep through.Clever and well made, 7/10.",Victor Frankenstein
8,classicsoncall,"""I will turn the tide of human existence here, tonight!""",7,12 November 2020,"There doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this latest reimagining of the classic Mary Shelley novel. Personally, I liked it, so maybe I caught it in just the right frame of mind. Placing Victor Frankenstein's (James McAvoy) assistant Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) as the central character was an interesting twist, by making him an equal in the quest to forge human life from the inanimate. I love the old time horror flicks of the Thirties and Forties in which some pseudo-scientific jargon is used to describe what the mad scientist was attempting to achieve. This story didn't go too far out on a limb in that regard, utilizing the theory of converting electrical energy into a biochemical equivalent, with a rabid, gone wrong chimpanzee as Frankenstein's first attempt. I've come on board as a tentative McAvoy fan ever since he portrayed the disturbed, personality riddled character Kevin Wendell Crumb in 2016's ""Split"" and the follow up in 2019, ""Glass"". Here he goes a bit more over the top in execution, almost verging on bat-s--t crazy in order to achieve his daring vision. A major component to the story is how Victor felt guilt and remorse over the death of his brother years earlier, and his resolve to correct the imbalance so to speak, by creating new life in his honor. The creature that resulted, the monster itself, was a grotesque amalgam of collected body parts, a standard feature of these numerous Frankenstein stories. I always wonder why the scientist couldn't simply take a deceased person and work the magic on him or her, but I guess then the story loses some of it's luster. This latest reinterpretation of the Frankenstein mythos combines elements of the 1931 movie original with a love story sub-plot that's visually exciting and well crafted. Fans of the original novel ought to give it a try.",Victor Frankenstein
9,lee_eisenberg,a new version of Frankie's story,5,19 June 2017,"We all know the story of Frankenstein. Or at least we think that we do. I've read the novel, and seen a number of movie versions (some faithful to the novel, some not). Paul McGuigan's ""Victor Frankenstein"" branches the story out, telling it from Igor's point of view. It's odd, since there was no assistant in Mary Shelley's original novel, least of all a hunchbacked one. But here we get Igor's backstory and how he came to know the doctor whose name is synonymous with bad science, and how they set about animating a dead body.Unfortunately, much of the movie is sort of silly. Although I liked how the depicted the police inspector as a hardcore Christian fanatic who considers science a form of witchcraft - sounds like a lot of Christians today, doesn't it?* - the movie goes too far on CGI. This isn't something of which Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy should be proud. It's not a bad movie, but it shouldn't be your first choice. ""Young Frankenstein"" is the best adaptation ever.*A strange irony is that so many of the religious people who denounce science as witchcraft or something similar have no problem using all of life's modern conveniences, all of them based on science.",Victor Frankenstein

11,paul_haakonsen,"Life is temporary, why should death be any different?...",6,24 September 2016,"Well, we are all more than familiar with the Mary Shelley tale of Frankenstein's Monster, so why would we need another movie depicting that particular tale? Well, the 2015 ""Victor Frankenstein"" movie is focused on the young medical student that is Victor Frankenstein and his assistant Igor, more than it is on the actual monster. So that makes this movie stand apart from so many other previous movies based on the same story.While everything in the movie was really nice to look at, and they had crammed so many interesting details into the many frames, then there was just something missing from the movie to make it outstanding. Mind you, that I am not saying that ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a bad or boring movie, not at all. It could just have been somewhat better in a sense.I really enjoyed watching James McAvoy in the role of Victor Frankenstein, and he really carried the movie quite nicely. Personally I don't really care much for Daniel Radcliffe or his acting talent, so him cast as Igor didn't really go well with me. But to be fair, then he did an adequate job actually. And it was a great treat to have iconic actor Charles Dance make a brief appearance as Victor Frankenstein's father.The approach of the Igor character was an interesting one, especially since he wasn't portrayed as a shambling, hunchback of low intelligence as many other movies have done. How they opted to go with the character was really a nice change of pace, and personally I enjoyed that quite a lot.The effects in ""Victor Frankenstein"" were quite good, and they helped the movie along quite nicely. The creature designs were rather impressive, both on the chimpanzee and on the actual 'monster' itself. Actually, I preferred the chimpanzee design over the 'monster', because it was just so much more unique and monstrous to look at.This is definitely a different take and approach on the classic Frankenstein tale, and one that was more than welcome after having been served the same tale in almost the same way again and again over the many years.If you enjoy the classic Mary Shelley tale, then you should do yourself a favor and sit down to watch ""Victor Frankenstein"". It is a rather entertaining story, and it is presented in a very nice and visual manner.",Victor Frankenstein
12,Hey_Sweden,Man is always the worst monster of them all.,6,6 October 2019,"With the credit for the screen story and screenplay going to Max Landis (son of John), the film ""Victor Frankenstein"" tells the now very familiar tale of mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) attempting to play God, defy death, and create life. This time, however, the tale is told from the perspective of his loyal assistant ""Igor"" (Daniel Radcliffe), whom he rescues from a sad life as an abused, hunchbacked clown in a circus. Victor is impressed with the clowns' knowledge of anatomy and ability to improvise, and so a collaboration is born.But Igor still has something of a moral compass, and worries when Victor plans on taking their experiments ""too far"". Meanwhile, the two of them earn an adversary in a religious Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott) who believes that he has a moral obligation to foil the not-so-good doctor.This viewer didn't find this film boring so much as just ridiculous, with some story developments and details that were simply laughable. And yet, everybody plays this very straight, and the material is not played as a parody or spoof (a la ""Young Frankenstein"" or even ""The Horror of Frankenstein""). Frankenstein story traditionalists might take strong exception to the new twists on the tale.But ""Victor Frankenstein"" is at least a good looking picture, if not as thickly atmospheric as any of the old Universal horror features of the 1930s and 1940s. It's well designed (by Eve Stewart) and photographed (by Fabian Wagner, in widescreen), and includes a thunderous, ominous music score by Craig Armstrong. The effects are variable: Victor & Igor's first creation is a hideous chimpanzee abomination named ""Gordon"", and the final Monster, otherwise known as ""Prometheus"", is a bulky beast that looks more like David Prowse in ""The Horror of Frankenstein"" than the traditional Boris Karloff-like image.The actors keep this watchable. Radcliffe is earnest as the protagonist who gets a vigorous makeover from Victor. McAvoy is an effectively looney Victor, giddy at times and lost in his own ambition. Jessica Brown Findlay is lovely and engaging as the trapeze artist who Igor has always adored. Freddie Fox is amusing as the morally bankrupt, sleazy rich kid who takes an interest in Victors' work. Scott plays his role *extremely* straight, with barely a change in his facial expression. Charles Dance is wasted in a one-scene role as Victors' disapproving father.All in all, this viewer was reasonably entertained by this florid variation on the Frankenstein legend, but others may not be as forgiving or kind towards it.Six out of 10.",Victor Frankenstein
13,LeonLouisRicci,A Noble Attempt but Most of the Movie Falls Flat,6,2 May 2016,"Trying to Modernize with Amped-Up Action, Steampunk and other things like that there, this Movie is just Trying too Hard. A Gothic Tone is totally Abandon for Over-Acted Characterizations (James McAvoy) and Very Loud Whizzing and Banging.Homages abound, mostly to the Films and not the Novel that are a Pleasant Diversion and won't be Spoiled here.After the Movie leaves the Circus where Daniel Radcliffe's abused Hunchback ""Igor"" is Rescued by Dr. Frankenstein, Color is Drained from the frame and is replaced by that most Awful Post-Modern Sepia-Tone Look that is Never Tone Inducing, just Boring.Boring is an Adjective that Moderns like to use to excess, for Fear of being ""Ordinary"" and They are the Target Audience for this Noble Failure. The Third Act where the Creature is brought to ""Life"" is a Prime Example of the Patronizing exhibited throughout.Worth a Watch because it does have some Interesting Elements like the First Experiment Demonstration at the University but nothing else in the Film Feels as Fresh.",Victor Frankenstein
14,CinemaSerf,"Fun, fairly fright-free, festive fayre for the telly...",6,29 June 2020,"This started out quite well with James McEvoy (""Frankenstein"") rescuing Dan Radcliffe from a life as a hunchback in the circus when he discovers that he has a bit off a penchant for medicine. They escape back to this lair and after a bit of rudimentary surgery, Dan has lost his hump and is fitting nicely into a costume left over from Spartacus and answering to ""Igor"". Once we do get over the intros, though, it reverts very much to type as hybrid of Hammer meets James Whale. There is good chemistry between the two stars; the script is at times quite funny and well paced; but there just isn't enough originality to distinguish it from it's multitude of forbears. Andrew Scott is the detective aided by a very trim Callum Turner as they try to track down the experimenting pair, but on this occasion Scott adds little and Freddie Fox , well least said. The last fifteen minutes redeem it, somewhat, too - plenty of good, lively visual and sound effects as we head to the conclusion. ""It's got thunder, it's got lightning...""",Victor Frankenstein
15,zardoz-13,One of the Better Frankenstein Reboots!!!,9,30 November 2015,"Anybody who has read Mary Shelley's landmark horror novel ""Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus,"" published in 1818, knows Hollywood has taken liberties with it. Basically, Shelley's saga has spawned more than 70 movies. Most of them would make the Gothic author spin in her grave. Among the movies, ""Hamlet"" director Kenneth Branagh's ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994), with Robert De Niro, qualifies as the best, displaying greater fidelity to the novel than any other adaptation. The latest rendering of Shelley's work, ""Push"" director Paul McGuigan's ""Victor Frankenstein"" follows dutifully in the footsteps of the Universal Pictures' classic with Boris Karloff as the monster. Nevertheless, ""American Ultra"" scenarist Max Landis provides some provocative changes. McGuigan and Landis pay tribute not only to the influential 1931 James Whale film with Karloff, but also Mel Brooks' farcical ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974), co-starring Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle. A triumph of production design in its recreation of Victorian Era London, ""Victor Frankenstein"" emerges as a energetic effort to launch a new franchise. Mind you, this isn't one of those horror movies where everything ends in fire and ashes. Instead, the mad scientist learns from his blunders, while everybody else--aside from the vile monster-- gets away. No, the PG-13 rated ""Victor Frankenstein"" won't afflict you with nightmares. Certainly it contains its share of gripping, white-knuckled moments, but it concerns itself more with thrilling rather than frightening audiences. Mind you, none of this will matter because ""Victor Frankenstein"" won't generate adequate box office to justify a sequel. British secret agents, old-school boxing champs, dames with arrows, animated dinosaurs, and heroes from a distant galaxy will divert virtually everybody from watching this rambunctious melodrama that deserves a far better fate. The first thing McGuigan and Landis change in the ""Frankenstein"" formula is the character of Igor. This revisionist tale unfolds from the viewpoint of the hero's faithful laboratory assistant. ""Harry Potter"" superstar Daniel Radcliffe plays an anonymous, subjugated, hunchbacked, circus clown. Everybody in Lord Barnaby's Circus mistreats this harmless innocent. Despite the circumstances of his miserable existence, the clown serves as the circus medic. Improbably enough, he indulges himself in the study of anatomy, and his anatomical illustrations are incredibly detailed. Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay, Lady Sybil on ""Downton Abbey""), a picturesque trapeze performer far above Igor's social status, is the only person who doesn't treat him like excrement. During a performance, she plunges to the ground, and the deformed clown saves her life. When this accident occurs, a medical student, Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy of ""X-Men First Class""), rushes to Lorelei's side, too. Victor is impressed with the clown's resourcefulness and capacity to improvise on the spot. Indeed, Frankenstein is so impressed that he helps the clown escape from the circus after his cruel employer, Barnaby (Daniel Mays of ""Byzantium""), has confined him in an animal cage. McGuigan stages this audacious getaway, as Victor and the clown narrowly elude Barnaby's fire-breathing and knife-slinging henchmen, like a daring Indiana Jones' cliffhanger. The surprise is the clown isn't a hunchback! Frankenstein perforates the clown's hump, actually a cyst, drains it, and them straps him into a back brace that straightens out his posture. Frankenstein then names him after his former roommate—Igor Strausman—who has vanished under mysterious circumstances. Clearly, Radcliffe's Igor shares little in common with previous Igors. Frankenstein makes Igor his partner, and they experiment with reanimating a pilfered pile of chimpanzee body parts. ""If life is temporary,"" observes Frankenstein, ""why can't death?"" During a demonstration at the Royal College of Medicine, Frankenstein and Igor bring a ghastly looking chimp to life. Sadly, this maniacal monkey business goes haywire, and Frankenstein has to kill the chimp after it goes on a rampage. Later, Frankenstein's intimidating father (Charles Dance of ""Underworld 5"") reprimands his ungrateful son for wasting time on such unspeakable experiments. Meantime, one of Victor's fellow medical students, Finnegan (Freddie Fox of ""Pride"") displays a deviant interest in Victor's use of electricity to reanimate dead tissue.""Victor Frankenstein"" reminded me of those invigorating ""Sherlock Holmes"" epics pairing Robert Downey, Jr., with Jude Law. Director Paul McGuigan, who helmed four Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman ""Sherlock"" episodes for BBC-TV, keeps our protagonist dodging adversaries, including an obnoxious Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott of ""Spectre""), who has been investigating the murder of a circus employee that died when Frankenstein rescued Igor. During their escape, one circus henchmen accidentally killed a cohort, and Turpin has been snooping into Frankenstein's sinister shenanigans. Meantime, Igor takes time out to romance Lorelei who left the circus after she fell. Naturally, she frets about Igor's antics with Frankenstein. At the same time, Frankenstein immerses himself in his experiments. Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy are splendidly cast as fast friends, with Radcliffe as more sympathetic and McAvoy as more insane. The questionable activities that they engage in to obtain body parts aren't depicted. Never do we see them either plundering graveyards for human remains or raiding zoos for animal body parts. Nevertheless, McAvoy's Victor Frankenstein is every bit as fanatical as Peter Cushing's Victor Frankenstein in the 1960s' Hammer Studios Frankenstein movies. The complaint that some Frankenstein fanatics may raise is the belated introduction of the monster. Not until the big finale are we shown the monster. Indeed, this monster is humongous, boasting two sets of lungs and two hearts. Comparatively, he resembles the albino giants in Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" (2012). Alas, the monster spends less than fifteen minutes on screen, and he lacks the ability to speak like Robert De Niro's literate monster in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."" Moreover, he is not the intellectual giant that Aaron Eckhart was in ""I, Frankenstein"" (2014). Like the escapade where our protagonists took flight from the circus, McGuigan orchestrates several other sequences with similar gusto. The final scene in an eerie Scottish castle where the monster draws its first breath beneath stormy skies stitched by jagged lightning bolts is sensational stuff. ""Victor Frankenstein"" ranks as an electrifying ""Frankenstein"" adaptation.",Victor Frankenstein

No, they did not go to the trouble of digging up and using lightning bolts to reanimate Boris Karloff. Since extras cost more than they used to in Mr. Karloff's 1930s heyday, you won't see hordes of villagers running around with torches and pitchforks in VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, either. Instead, we get a Gay love triangle between three young lads, one of whom already has reanimated the eyes of a late ex-. When this trio is not tied up in making eyes at each other, they're Hell-bent upon building Boy Toys to expand their circle of fun (it's important to remember that there's no ""Bride of Frankenstein"" under consideration here!). Only sometimes-hunchback Igor (a.k.a., Harry Potter) has a moment in this tale for the ladies (probably because of some latent spell cast upon him by either Hermione Granger or Ginny Weasley).

Same could be said of this odd production written by Max Landis and directed with some style by Paul McGuigan yet one wishes it had used some style like the Hammer films (in spite of some grande eloquent Victorian sets) and some humor (like the Karloff versions) while instead eliciting at best a shrug of going back to the drawing board for a better version envisioned.",Victor Frankenstein
18,neil-476,Tolerable,7,4 December 2015,"On spotting that an unnamed circus hunchback is a brilliant amateur doctor, Victor Frankenstein rescues him from slavery as a resident freak, cures his abnormality, names him Igor, and recruits him to assist in his experiments to bring life to new creatures cobbled together from bits of old creatures.This prequel plays fair with pre-existing Frankensteinian film mythology, and gives us a relatively straightforward (and also relatively inexplicit – it is a certificate 12A in the UK) origin of the Frankenstein/Igor partnership. It is handsomely staged with some decent set pieces and, intriguingly, is a film played completely straight but featuring a central performance from James McAvoy as Frankenstein operating at full ham, and loving every minute of it. Daniel Radcliffe as Igor does well with the physicality (although I got a bit fed up with the raised shoulder), falls somewhat short with the acting here and there and, as always with a period piece, is fatally hamstrung by his unmistakably 21st century estuary English accent.Taken as undemanding fun, this is successful enough in its own way.",Victor Frankenstein
19,ferguson-6,It's (barely) Alive,5,24 November 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. If a filmmaker is going to mess with the classics, there are two paths of creativity from which to choose: stay true to the original, or put a new spin on it. In this case, the classics in question are the nearly 200 year old novel from Mary Shelley (1818) and the nearly 85 year old movie from James Whale (1931). The filmmakers doing the messing are director Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin) and screenwriter Max Landis (son of director John). The spin they chose was (in theory) to tell the story from the perspective of Igor, the loyal assistant to Dr. Frankenstein.It's an interesting approach, but one that immediately presents a problem  since the title they chose was not ""Igor"", but rather Victor Frankenstein. The film does begin with Igor's backstory in the circus as a hunchbacked clown/amateur doctor, and the character does provide some early and late narration. The conundrum stems from the fact that pretty much everything else in the movie is centered on the mad scientist, rather than the skilled apprentice/partner.Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor and James McAvoy plays Victor Frankenstein (not Fron-kin-steen, in a nod to Mel Brooks), and both actors seem to be doing everything possible to bring energy and enthusiasm to a movie that can't seem to decide if it's a reboot or a reimagining or simply an origin story. Radcliffe effectively uses his physicality as the circus clown who is so mistreated and misunderstood, and McAvoy is such a hyper-active mad scientist that I'm sure his fellow actors many times were inclined to advise ""say it, don't spray it"". McAvoy does seem to be having a grand old time playing the brilliant yet unhinged young doctor-to-be, and to his credit takes a much different approach than Colin Clive when he gets to the infamous line ""It's ALIVE!"" The best parts of the movie are the intricate and amazing sets, the monster himself (albeit too brief), and the expert use of classical music and film score. The circus sets are colorful and active, while Frankenstein's soap factory home/laboratory is fascinating and creative, and the final Scotland castle on a cliff is breath-taking. Pulleys, chains and cranks are everywhere  as is an incredible amount of body parts, organs and fluids.After a very well done circus opening, we are jarred with a seemingly out of place action sequence involving a slo-motion chase and fight scene that seems to be attempting to mimic some of the recent Sherlock Holmes movie stunts. Here they are unwelcome and ruin the flow. Another aspect that seems forced and unnecessary is a romantic interlude between Igor and a trapeze artist (played by Jessica Brown Findlay). It feels like an add-on to remind us that it's supposed to be Igor's story. Additionally, Andrew Scott plays an intriguing Scotland Yard Inspector who is every bit as obsessed with his faith-based beliefs as Victor is with his science-has-no-bounds stance. A story told from the Inspector's perspective might have worked, but instead it comes across as another add-on. Another add-on is the filthy rich and very devious fellow med student (played by Freddie Fox) who agrees to fund the experiments, but mostly the character is an after-thought necessary to move the plot along. Wasted is the always menacing Charles Dance, who has but one scene as Victor's strongly disapproving daddy.A combination of the romance, minimal role of Igor in the grand finale, the medical school bumbling, the clunky Inspector involvement, and the all too brief monster appearance makes the film all but impossible for viewers to connect.

Daniel Radcliffe is a good actor and his roles since Harry Potter are actually show his range. The transformation from hunchback to Igor is quite an extreme makeover. James McAvoy is a also a very convincing actor and acts obsessed enough. Despite both actors being small sized they can pull off a big action movie. Jessica Brown Findlay of Downton Abbey is a pretty love interest (for Igor no less) and her role isn't irritating.The first resurrected creature and organs are quite morbidly frightening for what they are.The ending is grand but kind of wonder what did Victor expect once they brought him to life?

21,gradyharp,With apologies to Mary Shelley,6,14 August 2016,"Max Landis is responsible for the screen story and screenplay takeoff on Mary Shelley's epic 19th century novel FRANKENSTEIN and Paul McGuigan (Lucky Number Slevin, Push, Wicker and sundry television series). The 'revised version ' of Frankenstein proves colorful, atmospheric, well photographedand ultimately a very long song that grows a bit foolish were it not for a solid cast.As the movie producers summarize the film, 'James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe star in a dynamic and thrilling twist on a legendary tale. Radical scientist Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) and his equally brilliant protégé Igor Strausman (Radcliffe) share a noble vision of aiding humanity through their groundbreaking research into immortality. But Victor's experiments go too far, and his obsession has horrifying consequences. Only Igor can bring his friend back from the brink of madness and save him from his monstrous creation.'What is not added is that Igor has grown up in a circus as a hunchback clown (the hump being an abscess that Victor drains once he rescues Igor from the circus) who has a brilliant mind, a penchant for medical studies, and a crush on aerialist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) who falls just at the time Igor is being absconded from the circus to join him in his 'creating life' bizarre laboratory. For some reason Lorelei becomes an elegant lady and Igor cleans up well and the work to create Prometheus beings – and goes on forever until the law and reality set in and the Hulk lookalike (having been brought to life by lightning) is destroyed.The film drags on at a very slow and repetitive pace, but it works because of the interaction of McAvoy and Radclifffe – reason enough to watch it.",Victor Frankenstein

It all takes place before Victor made his creation with a dead body made of human parts.We do see how Igor (Radcliffe) came into the life of Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and how both start experimenting on body parts from animals turning it all into an animal creation coming to life but things go wrong. With the police on their tale they still want to create a new creature. Once alive it's were this flick stops and it's from their you know the history of Frankenstein.There's a lot of talking going on and here and there we do have some action like with the animal going berserk and towards the end when they are giving life to the dead body. Naturally there's a bit of love story going on between Igor and Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) a girl he saved in a circus were he worked as a hunchback. Not really my thing, so far Frankenstein (1931) is the only one I adore but the acting was excellent so I guess a lot of people will love this story.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Victor Frankenstein

There's been a lot of movies based on Mary Shelley's novel, some bad ones and some good ones, and I thought this version belongs to the good ones. It's a different approach but entertaining to watch. Daniel Radcliffe proves that he can act something else then Harry Potter. His collaboration with Victor Frankenstein played by James McAvoy works perfectly well in this dark picture. There are plenty enough moments of disgusting creatures and scenes to make the more sensation seekers happy. Why some people rate it so low remains a mystery to me.

It has a decent built up and some really good performance although it can be a bit over exaggerated sometimes. The director tried to go for a more fast-paced take on the Mary Shelley's classic novel. Although there isn't much depth to it, the action combined with the well written dramatic elements made this movie work. At least for the most part anyways. This movie focuses more on the character Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) and what made Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) tick and what drove him to his work. I give this movie a bit of respect for it being creative and well put together for the most part. The main drive of this movie isn't the steps it took to create the monster but the bromance relationship between Igor and Frankenstein.

25,Hellmant,It's not that bad!,5,1 December 2015,"'VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another adaptation of Mary Shelley's classic monster tale 'Frankenstein'; this one is told from Igor's point of view. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as Igor, and James McAvoy as Frankenstein. It also costars Jessica Brown Findlay, Andrew Scott and Freddie Fox. The film was directed by Paul McGuigan (who's also helmed movies like 'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' and 'WICKER PARK') and it was written by Max Landis (who also wrote 'CHRONICLE' and 'AMERICAN ULTRA'). The movie received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it horrifically bombed at the Box-Office (as well); it's not that bad though!The film actually tells the origin story of Igor (Radcliffe), Victor Frankenstein's (McAvoy) assistant. Igor was a hunchbacked circus clown, when the aspiring medical student, Victor Frankenstein, found him. Victor frees Igor, from his captors, and cures him of his giant cyst (and bad posture, because of it). He then enlists the surprisingly intelligent young man's help; in his extremely ambitious medical experiments. At first Igor is very excited, to be apart of such groundbreaking scientific work, but then he realizes Victor is insane; and his experiments are extremely dangerous.The movie is pretty cheesy, but somewhat entertaining. Radcliffe and McAvoy both give it their all, in their performances, and the directing is adequate. Landis's script is rather disappointing though, considering what a talented writer he's already proved to be; there's been many more original, and entertaining, adaptations of Shelley's classic work. Still, it's not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/41q3ZuWGdEE",Victor Frankenstein

Victor Frankenstein is just that. Led by James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe, Victor Frankenstein covers a new side of the myth of Frankenstein. This time focusing on Igor, a hunchback that is helped by Victor and recruited into helping him bring a human to life.I really liked McAvoy and Radcliffe's performance. They were both clearly having some fun and did the best they could with the script, it's just that the film never popped. Max Landis' script definitely had potential and there were a fair share of fun moments including a solid but pretty messy and convoluted climax, but Paul McGuigan's direction was iffy at best. The film is a very slow 2 hours long and I even had a difficult time staying awake at some moments. It was nice seeing Charles Dance show up for a glorified cameo, but that story line never paid off. I think the constant switch of backstories between Igor and Victor became misleading. I don't really know what the film wanted to be. I'm not even sure the movie knew what it wanted to be. In all, Victor Frankenstein was another bland action film that tried to be something it wasn't.

28,Cineanalyst,Frankenstein's Corporate Creation,3,27 August 2018,"""You know this story,"" Daniel Radcliffe's Igor repeatedly states in voiceover narration, as if trying to excuse the movie's being in a field of numerous Frankenstein films. I wonder, however, did the filmmakers know this story and which story exactly are they referring to? It can't be Mary Shelley's novel. I've read that, and this is not that. I suppose the story they meant are those in the classic Universal monster movies, mainly ""Son of Frankenstein"" (1939), which is where the characters of Igor and an inspector with an artificial arm originate.Igor, the protagonist and narrator in this iteration, is entirely different than Bela Lugosi's version, though, as is Andrew Scott's religious-zealot Inspector compared to that of Lionel Atwill's. Igor's hunched back is fixed by Victor Frankenstein after he is rescued from the circus, whereupon he becomes a romantic figure for the new character of Lorelei, a trapeze performer who in turn had her life saved by Igor. Meanwhile, Victor is another atheist mad scientist adulteration of Shelley's character. He had an older brother named Henry--the name of the Frankenstein in the 1931 and 1935 films and the first name of Victor's friend in the book. His death is the impetus for Victor's efforts to create life, a role in the novel better occupied by his mother, but the brother angle suits this movie's purposes for the parallel brotherly friendship between Victor and Igor, for whatever that's worth. One other Frankenstein film that this one imitates, intentionally or not, is ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) when Lorelei mispronounces Frankenstein's name--reminds me of better times watching Gene Wilder explain the proper pronunciation of his name in that film's parodying of the Universal series.I wonder why they didn't make Lorelei into Mary Shelley, who then could've become the author of the story, which would explain why Igor keeps saying we know this story, which makes no sense within the film's world otherwise--in fact, Victor contradicts that very statement in the end. The circus stuff should probably be changed, then, perhaps to drowning, which played an important part in the real Shelley's life and which would work as well as Lorelei's fall from the trapeze act to parallel Victor's later reanimation experiments. As it is, this only female character in the movie is utterly unnecessary. I mean, is she only there so that we don't think the guys are gay?The only appropriate addition this movie makes to the story is Finnegan, who bankrolls Frankenstein's experiments. This is how Victor goes from creating an ugly hybrid chimp to a giant monstrosity in a lab staffed with lackeys and corporate oversight. It's an apt analogy for a mainstream Hollywood movie that was never a good idea to begin with. Its re-imagining of the familiar story boiling down to a sophomoric morality tale of the dangers of playing God, as an excuse for a few action scenes, characters jumping off things to throw punches included, and a couple friendships whose lack of interest is entirely undeserving of the concluding slow-mo melodrama.",Victor Frankenstein
29,CuriosityKilledShawn,It's a evil,6,9 April 2019,"It's madness to think that of all the screen adaptations of Mary Shelley's novel virtually none of them have been source accurate. Even Kenneth Branagh's 1994 campfest took liberties. To be honest, I don't think the novel is really that good, but I do love anything featuring the monster, even Herman Munster, so I'm a sucker for multiple adaptations and such.This time around we have a foaming-mad Frankenstein played enthusiastically by James McAvoy with Daniel Radcliffe as his hunchback assistant Igor, liberated from the circus and his hunch drained of fluid so he can stand upright. He's the best character in the movie. Together they, slowly, plan to create their own living creature made from spare animal parts and graduate from a revolting humunculous to, eventually, the monster, for about 5 minutes.The first and last act of this movie is where the fun and excitement are. The middle section really drags though, with too many scenes inside the lab and not enough suspense or action. The movie was shot in 2013 but not released until the latter part of 2015. I wonder if there were behind-the-scenes troubles or difficulty editing the story. It might explain why a good 35 minutes feel so tedious.Sadly, the iconic monster design is a copyright of Universal Studios so any other studio wishing to make a Frankenstein movie must come up with a new look, which is what they seem to go for here. But Victor Frankenstein is a complete overhaul of the story, switching from Geneva to London and for the gothic castle to a Scottish ruin. It lacks the archaic European pathos that other adaptions have had in their favour.The lovely cinematography makes the movie a delight to look at though. It's surely the best looking Frankenstein to date. Paul McGuigan's visual style adds a lot of production value to a movie that could have been straight-to-Prime trash. It's a shame it didn't do better at the box office.Worth your time, just don't get frustrated with the dull middle section.",Victor Frankenstein

How can you turn something like that into something fresh and new? This one really pulled that off. The story you know is here, with a few needed twists and additions.

32,vincentlynch-moonoi,"The good, the bad, and the ugly...and that's just the production",7,18 August 2016,"The problems here are deep, though there are a few rewards, as well.First, since the story strays so far from the story we know, and fairly far from the novel, perhaps it would have been better if they had written the film as NOT Frankenstein. A different story. Of course, then it would have been dismissed as a rip-off of the Frankenstein story.Second, while I admit that I'm no fan of Daniel Radcliffe (at least since he grew up), I just don't think he gave the part of Igor what it needed. Particularly early on in the film, Igor needed the audience to be deeply sympathetic toward him, and Radcliffe is not a good enough actor to really pull that off. He's better later in the film, but that is long after there is no longer a need to have great sympathy for the character.What's good about the film? Well, James McAvoy turns in a bravura performance. He lets out all the stops, so to speak.The special effects are quite stunning, although I'm not quite sure why there are so many explosions in the film's climax.The detail in sets (many computer driven, of course) are nonetheless quite entrancing.In addition to McAvoy (as Dr. Frankenstein) and Radcliffe (as Igor), there's Jessica Brown Findlay as -- oddly enough -- Igor's love interest; she seems like a very talented and lovely actress. Andrew Scott is superb as the detective, although we are drawn to the ""bad guy"" (Dr. Frankenstein) more than we are the good detective who fully realizes the abomination Frankenstein is about to create.

35,eddie_baggins,As lifeless as a long forgotten cadaver,2,1 September 2016,"It's hard to say exactly who thought Victor Frankenstein was a good idea, but my suggestion would be that they're highly unlikely to have offers rolling across their table in the near future as Paul McGuigan's reimagining of Mary Shelley's classic tale is on par if ever so slightly more tolerable than its recent near namesake I, Frankenstein, which is to say, Victor Frankenstein is most certainly dead on arrival.There was never a hope that even the most electrified jolt of movie lightning was ever going to breathe life into this far too serious and downright muddled wannabe blockbuster event with American Ultra writer Max Landis delivering a ham fisted script that re-jigs Victor Frankenstein's scientific exploits with hunchbacked Igor into a tale of circus freaks, animal parts and terrible romantic subplots and with McGuigan's direction lacking any of the energy he bought to his previous films Push and Lucky Number Slevin, Victor Frankenstein's 110 minute runtime feels like a lifetime of mood lighting and damp grungy sets.There's effort to shock the movie into becoming entertaining in brief moments of action, like a circus escape and a college lecture gone wrong but with those scenes failing to ignite the film along with a misguided and lacking finale, Victor Frankenstein' hopes lay as dormant as a long forgotten cadaver.Another huge problem with this overly glum and lifeless creation is the pairing of James McAvoy as the charmless Victor and Daniel Radcliffe (horribly miscast) as the charisma free circus gimp turned Igor as the two actors struggle to forge any type of on screen chemistry together and had the film somehow managed to get these two characters to gel in a reasonable fashion, there's a small chance this trashy piece of Hollywood filmmaking gone wrong could've become a cult favourite or at the very least a so bad its good oddity.For the many varied fans of Shelley's original story, Victor Frankenstein should be avoided at all costs and while there are brief flashes of an entertaining reimaging on show here, McGuigan's film is as a whole a thoroughly unenjoyable creation that has neither the life within nor the heart to work on any level.

36,leonblackwood,A watchable movie but it could have been better! 4/10,4,29 August 2016,"Review: This is yet another remake, which turned out to be a big let down! James McAvoy plays Victor Frankenstein well but I found Daniel Radcliffe (Igor), quite annoying, and he seemed to be in the way most of the time. I was impressed with his acting, when he was playing the Hunchback with no name but as soon as he teamed up with Victor, McAvoys acting and screen charisma over-powered Radcliffe. With that aside, the main problem with the film is that it takes way too long for Frankstein to come to life, and when he finally does, it looked awful. It looked like a big slab of clay, more than a huge monster, and the weird looking monkey also looked a right mess. On the plus side, the chemistry between Radcliffe and McAvoy was half decent and the the action scenes weren't bad but the storyline took way too long to get going and I wasn't too impressed with the ending. I'm not surprised that the movie made a lose at the box office because there isn't any memorable moments and it didn't do this classic concept any justice. At the end of the day, it's better than the Robert DeNiro version but it's still not that great. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Paul McGuigan, 52, who also brought you Gangster No. 1 in 2000, The Reckoning, Wicker Park, Lucky Number Slevin and Push, so he has some experience when it comes to big scale movies. Personally, I think that he could have done more with Radcliffe's character and there wasn't much depth to the other actors, which I found quite disappointing. The love story was also weak and the whole look of the film was quite dull. Its still a watchable movie, from an entertainment point of view but I did expect more, mainly because of today's technology and the fact that these young actors have a lot of experience in the period genre.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $34millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/sci-fi/horrors, starring Daniel Radcliffe, James McAvoy, Jessica Brown Findlay, Bronson Webb, Daniel Mays and Spencer Wilding. 4/10",Victor Frankenstein
37,subxerogravity,The story of Frankenstein is there on top of a few layers of attempting to be hip and contemporary.,6,27 November 2015,"Victor Frankenstein's unholy obsession with making life from death turns him into a mad scientist and his creation into a monster.Though James McAvoy plays the title character, most of the plot focuses on Igor, played by Daniel Radcliffe. The film tries to make the hunchback more of an interesting character, giving him a back story of a genius judge by his looks until Frankenstein saw what was inside and mentored Igor into using his brilliant mind to help him built the monster. The movie takes more of a medical spin on how to put body parts together and make life. There is a lot of scenes about designing the monster, experimenting, failed experiments, and begging for money to people who think the two men are Godless creeps (which Victor himself is happy to play up).Visually, Victor Frankenstein does go classic horror on you with the Art direction and costume design. In this category, it does not try to prove it's more sophisticated than what we know about Frankenstein, but complements it's heritage. It's also gruesome and grotesque like an old school horror movie, pulling no stops of what an abomination reanimating dead corpses can be.Overall, it reminds me of Guy Richie's version of Sherlock Holmes, as the sidekick takes more of a center stage as we show you how disturbed the main charter can be. Not nearly as stylish as Richie's Holmes, which is good, cause they make up for it with a Universal style retro monster scary we rarely see these days. Way better than expected.",Victor Frankenstein

James McAvoy's depiction of Victor Frankenstein is a show stopper. He absolutely carries the movie. His performance is fantastic. The movie also contains a finale that can be best described as hysterical. It must be seen to be believed and enjoyed. It is one of the great endings in recent movie history, maybe in all of movie history. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. In a way, this movie is a throw back to the movies of the 1930s, replete with all the electrical gadgetry, castles and large cavernous interiors with open roofs to let in the lightening. Electricity plays a key role in the story. The pacing of the story is fast and relentless. This Victor Frankenstein is truly obsessed, indeed frantic. Nothing will stop him from creating life out of nothing. But although obsessed, he is also engaging and charming, albeit erratic to the point of distraction. But that's to be expected from a scientist who's into what he's into. Daniel Radcliffe is also excellent as Igor, but this is James McAvoy's movie. Essentially, this movie is a prequel to the actual, well-known Frankenstein story. The movie also contains a moral: when you create a monster you must be able to kill it too.

James finds Daniel, a hunchback, working as a clown at the circus-while James was looking for spare body parts from dead animals-and enlists him as an assistant in his work.

As with his turn in 2016's inexplicably acclaimed 'Split', his every movement, intonation, posture, grin and gesticulation never lets us forget he is acting. With sentences instilled with dangerous singularity, McAvoy spits out the words in textbook eccentric, rapid staccato. He is indulged by Paul McGuigan's excellent direction and looks great, but rather like a stage turn projecting to the back rows, there is not one ounce of anything naturalistic about his Victor Frankenstein. Perhaps it is deliberate; the confidence, bravura, enthusiasm, heightened unreality might be traits attributed to Frankenstein - or to these heightened performances in general - but unlike co-star Daniel Radcliffe's Igor (for example, and other characters too), we never *know* him, never like/dislike him, never really care for him, not even when the truth is revealed about his brother (Henry, brother of Victor: two of the most often-used names for Baron Frankenstein over the decades). As with all things, I can only offer my opinion on this.The long-awaited creation scene is spectacular. Occasionally threatening to lose hold of reality, it nevertheless takes advantage of modern filming technology; we can actually travel along the power-lines with the electrodes as they head for the inanimate creature. Whereas the first experiment involved a hellish and extremely effective chimpanzee amalgamation, the eventual human monster is battered and torn by the elements even before (or perhaps during) a time when life has been given him. A clay-like golem, he is a spectacle, but has no time to be anything more. An enhanced, stomping killer hulk that brings the house down.In two pleasing (deliberate or otherwise) nods to past glories, the police inspector Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott) loses a hand (à la one-armed Inspector Krogh from 1939's 'Son of Frankenstein') and the monster is animated only to wreck the laboratory and bring things to a close of sorts (à la the monster rallies at the end of the 1930/40's Universal run of pictures). Despite my reservations about McAvoy's performance, I enjoyed this a lot. It breathes new life into the pioneering story, which is no mean feat after all these decades, whilst never losing the guiding light of Mary Shelley's original novel.",Victor Frankenstein

Even with the excessive pathos in the beginning of the film, it still resonates with a brilliant two-man performance, worthy of those seen in films like Becket and Sleuth by both Daniel Radcliffe as a combination of the Hunchback of Notre Dame and the clown who cries inside and James McAvoy, with a measured, yet over-the-top Victor. The screenplay is beautifully written by Max Landis and the pacing of the film by director Paul McGuigan is impeccable. The acting reminded me of Henry V, and the monster reminded me of Prometheus. A wonderfully made film. A must-see.",Victor Frankenstein

He rescues Igor from the circus but an evil clown is killed during the escape.

46,s3276169,Almost excellent......,8,21 February 2016,"Victor Frankenstein is yet another reinterpretation of Mary Shelley's classic tale. This time it crosses over into cinematic history by including the character Igor who was first introduced in film in 1931 but was never present in the original novel. Its an approach that works well in the context of this film. Lets start by saying this film adaptation is well written. It taps directly into the question at the heart of Shelley's book of whether human beings have the right to use technology to play God. There's good tension and juxtaposition, between Frankensteins determination that scientific rationality trumps superstition. That death is a temporary, reversible state. This is in direct collision with Andrew Scott's, inspector Turpin. A man whose religious conviction affirms that man should not usurp the role of God, as giver and taker of life. Balancing the serious question at the heart of this tale, is the relationship set up between Frankenstein and medical genius circus performer, turned assistant,Igor. The warmth and at times humour in the relationship between Frankenstein and Igor, off sets and lightens the serious, sombre tones that typically inhabit this Gothic horror story. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast as Igor. His simple, almost goofy yet clever characterization, compliments James McAvoy's frenetically funny, almost, obsessive compulsive, Frankenstein. There is real human chemistry between these two actors that leaps off the screen, making this film inherently watchable. This is as much a tale of two odd-ball, science mad friends, as much as it is a morality tale and this film is all the better for it. The action sequences are well timed too and cleverly executed. Perhaps the only shortcoming in this film, is its latter half. The lack of genuine interaction and narrative between Frankenstein and his creation, in particular, is rather dissatisfying. Instead, what you get, is exposition, that leaves the film feeling incomplete. Its a shame too, as this is, in most regards, an excellent film. If a little more care had been taken this, could have been a truly memorable flick. Nonetheless, Victor Frankenstein is still a well acted, enjoyable Gothic horror romp with enough humour to lighten the load. Eight out of ten from me.",Victor Frankenstein
47,TheOneThatYouWanted,Worth watching!,9,4 December 2015,"It is a shame this movie got almost no marketing whatsoever. I don't even remember seeing a trailer for it on TV or even youtube. We didn't make it to the cinema on time to catch The Good Dinosaur so we ended up seeing this instead. This film explores the relationship with Igor and Victor Frankenstein. I know that sound boring but James Mcavoy's portrayal of the mad genius alone if worth the price of admission! He is hilarious, energetic and off the wall. This is very much a character driven film but the story is solid and the action and special effects are more than enough to satisfy everyone. It is refreshing to know Hollywood can still turn out films that do not need to molest your eyes with CGI and explosions to keep you entertained. It is a shame how most people will discover this film only after seeing it on a smaller screen.",Victor Frankenstein
48,Seraphion,Bland with no surprise,5,5 December 2015,"A circus clown who studies anatomy in his spare time. One day the circus' female trapeze acrobat Lorelei fell from the ropes. The clown, and a doctor Victor Frankenstein, rushed to her side. Igor managed to help the girl breathe again. The circus owner denies the clown's talents and locks him away. Victor frees him and they escape. Victor takes him as a his new flatmate and cures his hunchback, assuming the identity of his former flatmate Igor. The next day sees Igor's face on wanted posters, but Victor convinces him he's now a new man since he's no hunchback anymore like the posters describe. He helps on Victor's experiments. Victor takes Igor to a party where he sees the now well Lorelei. She thanks him for saving her. They then chat with Victor. At home Victor reveals his major project which has been possible from Igor's help; a creature sewn from different species cadavers. They manage to give life to it. The next day Victor brings the thing to a presentation. But it escapes, almost killing Igor until Victor reluctantly kills it. But with Finnegan supporting financially, Victor gets bolder, building an intelligent man instead of a beast. Detective Turpin who's on the circus case comes to Victor's place, seeing a link to the case. But Victor dismisses them due to they having no warrant. Victor's father comes and warns him harshly due to Victor's school informs that he's neglecting studies. But Igor encourages the down spirited Victor, inspiring him to build the man with 'augmentations'. Near the project's completion, Victor delays it to give Igor a night off with Lorelei. The next morning the police try to barge into Victor's place so Igor sneaks past them inside. Not wanting the police confiscate his experiment, Victor push the schedule forward to bring the man alive. Turpin gets in, holding Victor at gunpoint. They struggle, ending in Victor and Igor escaping with Finnegan's help while Turpin loses a hand. Finnegan tries to kill Igor by drowning him. He survives and Lorelei helps him. Igor and Lorelei soon goes to Victor. Turpin follows them. Igor finds Victor but the doctor doesn't heed and instead continue on with the experiment. The man shows signs of life after being zapped by lightning. But another lightning strikes the tower, chaining incidents that kills Finnegan. The man, the Frankenstein monster, lives. Victor talks to him as if he's his brother Henry. But Turpin shoots it, angering it. Victor finally heeds Igor and with him battles the monster. Igor manages to stab it's heart but with two hearts, the monster rises again. Victor manages to finally kill it.Well, having actors like Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy, and a story base that has been so popular over the many decades, prove to be a challenge to big for the movie creators to handle. The story feels so bland that all the story developments didn't give any sense of surprise or interest.Even as the story serve the tale from the new fresh perspective of Igor, it fails to give anything that wows the audience. It made sense for me. The movie made Igor tell the story. But the story itself is about Victor, which made the focus kind of wanders off from time to time between the two. This creates the weird mood on the movie, particularly on the latter parts when the focus shifts interchangeably between Victor and Igor very often.The movie also fails to center itself on the many values it had spotlights on. There are things about potential heresy, scientific advancement, past trauma, reluctant friendship, and also the thing with the detective Turpin. All those many plots and subplots didn't have any that gets the movie's main and center focus. They all get adequate introduction to make the audience care about them, but they didn't seem to have the adequate conclusion.The acting overall is surprisingly quite low in my view. James McAvoy didn't really get it right as a Russian in London at that time frame. Daniel Radcliffe nailed his part better, although I must say that the movie itself didn't really give enough depth to the clown and Igor. Jessica Brown Findlay's role felt like she's there only to get that bed scene in the movie.For me Victor Frankenstein (2015) deserves only a 5 out of 10 score. I really don't recommend you wasting money for this on the cinemas as there are many better alternatives.",Victor Frankenstein
49,EdgarST,For the Love of Igor,5,19 November 2019,"This adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel is quite intelligent in its premise and works well for a good part of the duration. It works despite the fact that the scriptwriters took many liberties with the limits of credibility too soon, suddenly transforming the hunchbacked circus clown not only into an erect monkey, but one full of social graces. It also never assumes the homoeroticism that permeates all the story, but it may be asking too much of a product conceived for assiduous mall crowds and related. So, Victor and Igor and the rest are surrounded by good production design and their performances are credible but cliché (sad and hunchbacked clown, arrogant and boisterous medicine genius): then all the honors go for Andrew Scott as Inspector Turpin, an agent of Scotland Yard, a ruthless and pharisee Catholic fanatic. But then... psychologism bursts in (with the secondary plot about brother Henry Frankenstein, family motivations, tears and that stuff) and the whole construction collapses and never recovers. At least Hitchcock waited until the end to introduce those exasperating explanations of Psychology 101 (usually worthy of a Venezuelan-Mexican soap opera) in the culmination of ""Psycho"" that almost destroy the fine edifice built in the preceding minutes. That ""fine edifice"" was so good, that we willingly forgave Hitchcock's impudence... But this is not the case.",Victor Frankenstein
50,rgkarim,"Gruesome, Dark, and Somewhat Boring. Acting is the lightning to this movie",7,26 November 2015,"Happy Thanksgiving everyone! This glorious holiday is a day filled with turkey, football, family, and monsters. Wait did I just say monsters? Yes I did my friends. Although it is a holiday, movies do to take a break from premiering on the silver screen. My holiday movie assignment is a little unorthodox this year, and comes in the form of Frankenstein. The patchwork nightmare from Mary Shelly's imagination has had many iterations, but Paul McGuigan has delivered us a movie that promises to be darker in tone. Today we cover Victor Frankenstein, headed by the dynamic duo of Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy. The theme of this movie focuses on the Mary Shelley's classic tale told through the eye of the assistant Igor. Radcliffe takes the lead in this origin story, as Igor is dragged into the world of 19th century scientific medicine and its unethical practices. The main plot of this film corresponds to the classic book, but Victor Frankenstein is laced with multiple subplots that provide some variety and character development. Almost all of these side stories are laced with darkness, many involving the obsessive pursuit of answers by immoral means. While the variety is a nice welcome some of these elements I felt were hastily pieced together and lacked the emotional fervor they were looking for. In addition the plot was also kind of boring, lacking the suspense and excitement I was hoping for. This was especially true in the horror element. For a horror movie, Victor Frankenstein was not the scariest thing to grace theaters. Instead I felt it went more down the disturbing avenue. This is especially true of the visual effects and make- up, which were fantastic in this film. I was impressed when I saw organs and muscles pulsate and contract, in a high-definition shine that amplified the effect. The computer animation also was well done, blending into the live action with fluid transition and texture. This realism certainly establishes nightmare-inspiring moments, where festering creatures and a beefed up Lunk from Goonies roam about unbound by any rationality or restraint that mirror their creators' desires. Even our human characters are not spared from inhumane torture and gore strewn injury that is truly skin crawling. I felt that some of these moments were a little over the top, and took too much focus from the story. Nevertheless, those with weak constitutions or religious zealots should avoid this tale. For this reviewer, the acting was the best quality of this film. James McAvoy as the mad scientist was a fantastic pick by the casting director. The man continues to impress me with how he can juggle his characters emotions without crossing over into annoyance. McAvoy's portrayal of insanity in voice work, facial expressions, and body language itself is first class. Daniel Radcliffe also doesn't disappoint as Igor, committing to his character from the start by portraying the shuffling gait of the hunchback (not an easy task). Radcliffe's charm was nice to see, which made for a likable character that I could to root for in this miserable setting. As usual it's the chemistry between the two that is the most impressive component. They played well off each other's emotions, with a synergy that was dynamic, energetic, and somehow dark at the same time. I hope to see these two reunite for further films. Jessica Brown Findlay deserves some mention, for she provided the touch of elegance in this chaotic slew of science. Not only is she beautiful, but Findlay radiates the classiness of her character that commanded respect and provided a love story. Andrew Scott once more steps into the mad, obsessive role, though ironically plays an inspector this time around. Scott not only captures the mannerisms of the insane, but somehow adds that hint of uneasiness to really sell the part. If only he had been utilized a little more. Victor Frankenstein is a movie that truly calls for those who love the dark and grotesque. The acting and special effects will immerse you into the world and deliver the realistic horrors you have been looking for. While I did enjoy the focus on Igor this time around, I have to say the movie wasn't as suspenseful as I had hoped. This left me bored at times and waiting for the move to end. I cannot recommend this movie for a theater visit, but would encourage you to give a shot when it comes to RedBox. My scores for this film are: Drama/Horror: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Victor Frankenstein
51,eric262003,Good To Watch On Rainy Day But Nothing Outstanding,6,1 May 2017,"The opening statements to ""Victor Frankenstein"" is ""you know the story..."" and indeed we all know from the pages of Mary Shelley's classic horror novel from 1818 and to the numerous adaptations that gave graced the silver screens. Here we have another take from the classic story that's an added addition towards the other previous adaptations. Director Paul McGuigan collaborated with scriptwriter Max Landis gives us an original take of the movie seen for once through the eyes of Dr. Frankenstein's humble assistant Igor Strausman (Daniel Radcliffe). We first meet Igor as a nameless hunchbacked circus clown who had to encounter a lot of physical abuse all for the sake of entertainment. When not pleasing the crowd, Igor also serves as a physician to the other acts. When an incident involving a trapeze artist goes awry, Igor is introduced to Dr. Frankenstein (James McAvoy).Feeling that his gifts are being wasted, Frankenstein frees Igor from this uncompromising lifestyle to come work with him. Their escape wasn't easy because a strong man, a knife thrower and several performers were on their tails. The estate Dr. Frankenstein calls home resembles a posh and resourceful science laboratory. After removing a cyst, and replacing a back brace concealer on him, Dr. Frankenstein adopts him the name of Igor Strausman. It seems the Frankenstein and Igor were once roommates who was once involved in taking part in recreational drugs who's been MIA for a while. With a hired assistant, Frankenstein can now propose his latest creation that will make him famous.Set in the murky and dreary 19th century London, the movie takes in the effort of going for a new approach to the lore of Frankenstein by narrating the story seen through the eyes of Igor for a change. However, it still doesn't seem to stand up to the other adaptations based on Shelley's novel. It looks like its teetering towards an origin tale, but it never goes to deeper scrutiny as to how Dr. Frankenstein got the notion of bringing the deceased back to life. There's a few snippets of Victor's childhood involving his father's visitation (Charles Dance, but it offers very little insight.Thrown in the thick of things is Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott) who's called to the scene to investigate on stolen animal parts missing from the London Zoo and the Royal Veterinary College and murder at the scene of the circus. Turpin suspects Victor and Igor are up to something as his investigation leads toward their path. Turpin tries to challenge Victor's progressive points of view with Turpin's having more religious way of thinking. The whole science vs. religion conflict is handled subtle but to the point along with the contrasting wardrobes the two rivals wear. Victor is seen wearing flashy colourful clothing while Turpin's choice of clothing is mundane and in grey.As we get to know Victor and Igor, their friendship is stronger to the point of bordering towards homosexuality. But that theory gets put to rest once Igor develops an infatuation with trapeze artist Lorelai (Jessica Brown Findlay). Like Igor she left the circus and has lived a life of freedom. Lorelai catches onto Victor and Igor's creation and it's this scene plus the unveiling of their creation that make up for the rather mundane dialogue throughout most of the film. Sure we may see the sci-fi genre come alive here, but it's only very sporadic when more could have been added on to hold your interest.Radcliffe tries to make us forget about Harry Potter and succeeds in making a morally inclined character in Igor as he clings onto his new life by staying loyal to his master while questioning if playing God is good or bad. McAvoy clearly is the star here as he plays Frankenstein with dimensions ranging from a delusional lunatic to a lighter funny side with his interactions with Igor. There's some great chemistry between McAvoy and Radcliffe, if only they had a more competent direction of where they were going with the story they'd be better.So while it is mildly enthralling to watch, and the special effects are quite eye-catching, with some light humour and good action to keep one intrigued. It's a good watch for a rainy afternoon, just don't expect any drastic impact compared to the other interpretations from the other adaptations from the classic Mary Shelley novel.",Victor Frankenstein
52,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,It's alive?,5,29 November 2015,"The opening shot, blurry, a figure moving in slow motion, brought to my mind a scene in the book of the monster seen going across the snow- covered landscape from a distance, ... but that is about as close to the book as the film gets, which is both good and bad. It's good because it tells an original take on the story, but it's also bad because it tells a mostly satirical story, told from Igor's perspective, largely poking fun at the clichés in the various film versions of Frankenstein, rather than a faithful adaptation of the novel.James McAvoy hams it up as Victor Frankenstein, with a brilliant intro (""Might I know your name?"" Igor asks him, Vic turns to look at Igor, freeze frame, title appears) while the rest of the cast downplays it nicely, Jessica Findlay is quite attractive, even in the unrevealing Victorian-era clothing. The film is sightly more serious than its comedic-looking trailer made it appear. Good sets and costumes, and some quick witted, sharp dialogue, but the story never really comes alive (pun totally intended)Curiously released at Thanksgiving 2015, it might have fared better than its $600.000 opening if it had been released at Halloween. Considering this was filmed in late 2013, it surely must have been ready for Halloween 2015, or 2014 for that matter.",Victor Frankenstein
53,mhorg2018,Waste of a good cast,1,17 August 2018,"Told from the perspective of Igor, this is just a terrible film which seems they took five different scripts, threw them in a blender and then let a bunch of chimps rearrange them (which may be an insult to the chimps), barely recognizable as a Frankenstein film, it's just an utter waste of time. Only I, Frankenstein is worse than this trash.",Victor Frankenstein
54,moviexclusive,"Better than it has any right to be, this revisionist spin on the classic Mary Shelley creation finds its heart in the men behind the monster",7,26 November 2015,"""You know this story. A crack of lightning. A mad genius. An unholy creation,"" intones Daniel Radcliffe's Igor Strausman, who warns us at the start not to expect a literal re-telling of Mary Shelley's beloved horror classic. Instead, as imagined by writer Max Landis, this latest spin focuses on the relationship between the titular mad genius – played by James McAvoy – and his trusty associate Igor who becomes instrumental to his dream of re-animating the dead. Yes, though Victor first meets Igor as a nameless hunchback at the circus, the latter is in fact a gifted physician whose knowledge of the human anatomy makes him invaluable to Victor's plan of assembling various organs into an outer shell and introducing life into it.But even before that, Victor recognises something special in the filthy clown with the rat's nest of a hair who rushes to the aid of a trapeze artist Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) following a near- fatal fall during a show and manipulates her bones in order to save her life. So Victor decides to give the destitute sad-sack a new lease of life by first busting him out of the circus, where at his cavernous home cum laboratory, he proceeds to drain the fluid from the young man's massive abscess, fit him with a back brace, and give him the name of his absent flatmate Igor whom Victor says is a morphine addict who has not been seen for months. Igor is indebted to Victor, and so without much question, assists his 'saviour' in his experiment to bring life to a homunculus stitched from animal- part discards from the local zoo.If you're waiting for the iconic hulking man-monster to appear, let us warn you that you'll have to wait until the very finale, which takes place on a very stormy evening in a remote Scottish castle right next to the sea. Indeed, this is less a movie about Victor actually creating his monster and what happens afterward than about the process leading up to that pivotal moment, which its director Paul McGuigan centres on a debate between theology and technology as well as an emotional complement in the bond between Victor and Igor. To introduce the former into the narrative, McGuigan interrupts the scientific proceedings with the entry of a moralistic Scotland Yard detective (Andrew Scott), whose past has not only made him a man of unwavering faith but also obsessed with stopping Victor's experiments he perceives as Satanic.It is also this said inspector who causes Igor to question Victor's research, especially in the wake of Victor's Royal College of Medicine presentation of his first hodgepodge Prometheus which unsurprisingly does not end well. Not unsurprising too is how Victor is constructed as both the emotional and moral centre of the film – though he starts off subservient to Victor, Igor struggles with the ethical implications of using science to achieve immortality, which ultimately leaves him conflicted with the dilemma of sticking by the person who had rescued him from eternal ignominy or following his own conscience. Igor also finds his heart with Lorelei, who makes a somewhat amazing recovery to help Igor find his centre of being.Though the romance is contrived, McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with charm and gravitas, and they make good use of both qualities to keep us engaged in their bromance. McAvoy overdoes the mad-genius bit on more than one occasion, but is on the whole appropriately brash and obsessed to play the brilliant, extroverted yet socially bizarre Victor. At least Radcliffe complements his partner with a nicely understated performance, which expresses his character's anguished, good-hearted and conflicted nature at various points. Next to Victor, Igor is a much more straightforward persona, but Radcliffe does what he can to make us empathise with the latter's plight.On his part, McGuigan keeps a tight balance between horror, drama, romance and even a few spots of comedy, while ensuring that the pace doesn't sag. No stranger to Victorian-era London from directing several episodes of 'Sherlock', he forgoes more handsome evocations for a more grimy and downbeat vision of 19th-century London that is more befitting of the grotesqueness of Victor's creations. Oh yes, despite the rating, you'd do well to note that some images are absolutely not for the squeamish, in particular because the film does not shy away from displaying the various organs of the body which Victor uses to assemble his unhuman work of science.As an origin story, you could do much, much worse than 'Victor Frankenstein', which is loud and messy all right, but has a quieter, more grounded centre on its arguments of faith versus science as well as a compelling relationship between its two lead characters. That's provided of course that you're willing to accept a revisionist take in the first place, with Frankenstein played as a soulless hulk that is prone to violence but nothing more and relegated almost to an afterthought right at the end. Like we said, this isn't about the monster as we typically know it, but the journey leading up to its creation, one that is undeniably intriguing in itself.",Victor Frankenstein
55,quincytheodore,"Stitched together from archaic fable tricks, Viktor Frankenstein is an empty vessel at heart.",5,25 November 2015,"Perhaps the Frankenstein name is indeed cursed, there hasn't been a great Frankenstein based movie in years, even decades. From last year's I, Frankenstein to Van Helsing who only has it as subplot, all have met mediocre fate. Now armed with robust acting power and visual that oozes Victorian era, also a bit or horror and action attached somewhere, another rendition shares the same exact fate; cinematic tediousness.A slight modification to the narrative is made, just like Sherlock the movie is narrated from the sidekick's perspective, in this case Igor's (Daniel Radcliffe). Aside from that, there's barely anything new that hasn't been done in similar or better fashion. To its credit, it's not utterly terrible in term of presentation, in fact the visual is rather nice. It's quaintly dark and electric version of last decade metropolis, Tesla would approve.James McAvoy as the titular Viktor really tries hard on establishing the character. Given the stale material, he still manages to squeeze some emotional scenes as well as a good chemistry with Radcliffe in a bromantic kind of way. Andrew Scott from Moriarty fame, now plays the role of Inspector Turpin. He's the polar opposite of Viktor, conservative yet equally clever and ambitious.Unfortunately, the far too familiar plot fails to produce any thrill, the strong acting prowess ends up rehearsing the same routine of mad scientist's banter. There's screaming, philosophical argument, faux science and slight mental abuse by the two leads. It's a lot of noise of little dramatic effect. Not that the script is bad in any way, it has occasional witty lines although any hint of humor or charm is muffled by the overly melancholy tone.At some points, the movie tries to dabble in horror, action and even romance subplot. The atmosphere is already primed for thriller, but the shocking abomination is ironically timid and unmemorable. Action consists of a few scenes of slow motions repetition. Despite the production offering distractions, the main story line is very straightforward and streamlined, and sadly also predictable.For all the star and flair, though they might be mildly amusing, the end product is a medium so lacking of life.",Victor Frankenstein
56,pyrocitor,"""Flat. Flat head. Why? Because I LIKE it""",6,2 June 2016,"Proud member of the Jack Reacher school of 'what the hell do we call this wannabe franchise grab let's just name it after the protagonist' (I'm still dreading the day ""James Bond"" hits multiplexes), Victor Frankenstein is just as cutely campy, if not quite as enjoyable, as you'd hope. Director Paul McGuigan and screenwriter Max Landis opt for the action comedy buddy cop feel of the Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes (another lazy title culprit!). Sadly, proceedings here are too undercooked to cough up the same irreverent spark.That said, the film does has its moments of jubilance. The first set piece, with McAvoy's Frankenstein breaking Radcliffe's medically savvy, hunchback out of his circus confinement, is the nutty highlight. Full of deliriously over-the-top slow-mo jump-punches against a canvas of exploding circus paraphernalia, it's deliciously stupid, and by far the most fun we have here. Shortly after a cheerily gruesome emergency surgery de-humpifying Radcliffe and branding him with the name we're all waiting for, McGuigan plays the body horror card, and it doesn't work quite as well. First, we wait for it, stalling with hours of surgical montages and listless pontificating on the morality of conquering death, as well as an ill-advised romantic subplot - the less said thereof the better.Their first bout with reanimation, recalling the grotesqueries of Dr. Moreau, is fun, but filled with overly familiar gore squirting/jump out scare tactics. It's mostly memorable due to Landis' surreal decision to name the creature ""Gordon,"" speaking to a goofiness the film could sorely use more of. Afterwards, we're left treading water in more stale morality/spirituality debates as we await the defining creature feature, now clearly earmarked as climax. Sadly, despite McGuigan's best fire, lightning, brimstone, etc. posturing, it's a slipshod affair - rushed, over-reliant on tacky CGI, and annihilating any inherent complexity in the Frankenstein mythos. Kenneth Branagh's 1994 Frankenstein is far from a perfect film, but handled this balance between campy Hammer gore and classical existential angst far more smoothly, as well as giving us some time with De Niro's gnarly creature. Here, we get a brainless, grunting stab-fest employing Frankenstein's Creature as a boss battle prop, made all the more awkward by the fact that Radcliffe's Igor, who the film took extensive pains to deliver to the remote castle in time, is a conspicuously absent bystander for the majority of it. McGuigan tries to spice things up throughout, punctuating the endless montages with comic book freeze-frames and scribbled anatomy textbook tracings over the moving image, a-la Sherlock. Still, it's a strained effort to revitalize a film that largely feels like an over-budgeted accidental after-thought.As with most such lacklustre buddy cop slogs, it's left to our cast to make things worth our while. James McAvoy is well-attuned to the kind of spirited campiness the film is asking for, and his yelping, nearly frothing at the mouth Frankenstein is good, trashy fun throughout. He's even charming enough to commit valiantly to an asinine, halfhearted tragic backstory, bless him. Next to McAvoy's scene-chomping, Daniel Radcliffe shoulders the film's whiny straight man/boring moral compass by comparison, but he's irresistibly affable enough to pull it off. He's clearly far more interested in Igor's carnivalesque eccentricities, and is far more interesting when applying his remarkably pliable physicality to Igor's slumping, shambling, toad-like circus days, keeping a defiant glint amidst his grovelling, and it's only his inherent charm that makes his dull courting of Jessica Brown Findlay's wary circus acrobat tolerable by comparison. Sherlock's Andrew Scott (who, between this and Spectre, is being severely wasted on the big screen through no fault of his) adds an appealing weird, slushy dourness to his obsessive religious detective. Still, he's unmistakably a plot device the film labours clumsily to incorporate in for sufficient dramatic effect throughout, and his own tragic backstory (Landis doles them out bargain-bin style) is yet another unnecessary distraction at best.Igor's opening ""You know this story"" voice-over (ugh) is meant to play as smugly reflexive, but instead points out Victor Frankenstein's fundamental redundancy, and how immaterial its tweaks to the Frankenstein myth are. There are too many easy Frankenstein analogies to apply here condemning the film's final product: indulgent, selfish, foolish, monstrous, verging on an ill-advised disaster. Ultimately, it's harmless, braindead, throwaway camp, made oodles more enjoyable by its charismatic leads. Still, we're closer to the level of Van Helsing's Frankenstein lore than Boris Karloff here.-5.5/10",Victor Frankenstein

58,drjgardner,Excellent Imaginative Prequel,8,27 July 2017,"Not really a retelling but an imaginative prequel to the original 1931 Frankenstein film which itself was a major deviation from the book.Some people may think this is a retelling, but by the end of the film it's clear that it is a prequel, though the hints are there all along.The film has much to commend it, including the acting of James McAvoy (Frankenstein), Andrew Scott (Detective Turpin), and Jessica Findlay (Igor's love interest). The music and photography are excellent and the set and costume people create an excellent picture of Victorian London.I particularly liked the idea of the film being told from the POV of Igor.On the negative side, Daniel Radcliffe's performance added very little and the film was a tad too long.There is nothing to match the 1931 original nor the 1935 Bride of Frankenstein, but otherwise this film holds up well against the hundreds of other Frankenstein films.

60,dave-mcclain,"""Victor Frankenstein"" is an original but odd take on the time-honored tale.",5,29 November 2015,"It has been written for hundreds of years that the only two things that are certain in life are death and taxes. But for thousands of years before that, people had been trying to figure out how to beat one or the other (or both). A young British woman named Mary Shelley tapped into interest in that whole trying to beat death thing when she published her novel ""Frankenstein"" way back in 1818. Many (but not all) feel that Shelley's story is literature's first example of science fiction. Either way, there can be no disagreement about the enduring interest in her story over the past two centuries. Many publications, interpretations and differing versions later, 2015 gives us the horror film ""Victor Frankenstein"" (PG-13, 1:49). This version uses Shelley's basic idea of a scientist trying to create life out of death and takes as its title the full name of the author's most famous character, but uses little else from her original story.Named after the creator of ""the monster"", the story is told through the eyes of the scientist's loyal assistant, Igor (Daniel Radcliff). As the film opens, he is an abused nameless hunchback clown in a traveling circus. One night when a trapeze artist named Lorelai (Jessica Brown Findlay) falls during a performance, the hunchback rushes to her aid, as does local university science student Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy). You wouldn't know it to look at the hunchback, but he's well-read and kind of brilliant. Impressed with his knowledge of anatomy, Victor frees the hunchback from his captivity. Victor takes the hunchback home, fixes his hump by draining it, forces his body into an upright position, fits him with a back brace and gives him the name of Victor's often-absent assistant, Igor.Without telling him why, Victor sets Igor to work repairing damaged internal organs of animals, while Victor himself is in an underground laboratory working on something. The scientist is so excited about the progress they're making that he treats Igor to a night on the town – a high class party where Igor and Lorelai meet again – both considerably better off than the last time they saw each other. She has recovered from her fall and is now keeping company with a society gentleman, while Igor has cleaned up quite nicely. Victor isn't shy about talking to people about his experiments and Lorelai becomes the voice of reason and moderation as she learns more about what the two men are up to, while Igor is too blinded by his loyalty to Victor to clearly see what's happening and what he should do about it.Regardless, the progress on Victor's experiments continues. He presents his first major success at his college and gains a rich, but unscrupulous benefactor (Freddie Fox) and a crucible full of problems. He arouses the fear of the townspeople, the ire of his father (Charles Dance) and the attention of a crusading police detective named Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott). The rest of the movie involves Victor hurrying to bring his work to its logical conclusion while engaged in increasing levels of disagreement with Igor and a battle of wits with Turpin who sees Victor's work as an abomination in the eyes of God.""Victor Frankenstein"" treads its own path through the dark forest that is the Frankenstein story, but some may take issue with just how different it is. The scenes of Victor's work progressing seem unnecessarily gruesome. That might not have been a problem if the tone of the rest of the movie were consistent with the horror, but McAvoy's performance is distractingly whimsical. It's not humorous in the usual sense and is meant to show his character's madness, but the characterization just comes off as strange. The rivalry between Frankenstein and Turpin pits an atheist scientist against a strongly Christian detective, making both extremes seem like one-way tickets to crazy town. The set decoration is excellent and the performances of Radcliff and Scott are outstanding, but all these positives can't quite make up for the weirdness in the story and the ridiculousness of some of the scenes. In short, this film deserves kudos for its originality, but falls short in its execution. ""B-""",Victor Frankenstein
61,MihaiSorinToma,Good re-imagining which focuses on Igor's character,8,23 September 2018,"Since he was little, Igor had a lot of suffering to endure. We follow a small part of his troubled past but focus later on the events which follow his meeting with Victor Frankenstein, one which will change his life forever, for better or worse. This reimagining of the famous story about Frankenstein, told from Igor's perspective, brings together two actors which I personally like very much. They manage to create a credible bond between two likeable although quite different characters whose story is presented together with its ups and downs. The plot presented is quite good, although a bit predictable from time to time, thanks to the famous nature of the material it's based on. It brings an exciting intrigue, builds up suspense and drama, while ending pretty unexpected, in a good way, at least as far as I'm concerned.The character development is also good, managing to transmit a lot solely by expression, let along words or actions. They bring emotion, excitement and suspense but the movie could arguably have done better regarding this aspect, especially if it had a better ""antagonist"". I'm referring of course to the inspector whose actions and especially facial expression seem lame, although he seems to be determined to prove his point and solve the case. The acting or his character could clearly have been better as you don't get to feel his presumed determination and this is quite a shame.The universe described on the other hand is very credible, dark and even gruesome, making it a very suitable place for the events to take place. The movie uses some pretty neat graphic overlays which do a very good job in describing what is about to happen. Also, it uses an interesting artistic direction or better said filming style, which left me with a positive feeling. They've done a very good job in this department and their work can be clearly seen in this film.Overall, I found it to be a good movie. Great actors, mostly great characters, a good plot and an unique artistic direction contribute to a movie which kept me interested until the end and even made me lust for more. Its apparently few and small flaws on the other hand made it lose a bit of polish which could have made it great.",Victor Frankenstein
62,swilliky,"Slick production, decent acting, but a poor script",3,28 November 2015,"Yet another retelling of Mary Shelley's horror tale Frankenstein, this one focuses more on action and downplays the horror. I went in with low expectations after the reviewers mostly panned it. Daniel Radcliffe stars as the hunchback Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's assistant. He works as a clown in the circus, backstory that was extrapolated on since Igor isn't even in the original novel. The hunchback is quickly dispelled in some ridiculous fashion about a puss filled growth on his back and his spine is straightened by a contraption so that Radcliffe can walk around normally and be a handsome lead. His performance wasn't terrible and I hope the Harry Potter actor continues to get interesting roles in movies.James McAvoy was entertaining as always as the mad scientist himself. He seemed trapped within the confines of the script and the tired retelling but usually he lights up the screen in any performance. There was a hint at a sequel at the end but I think that was just wishful thinking.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Victor Frankenstein
63,abisio,Very well acted update on the Frankenstein tale,9,26 November 2015,"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was more intended as a cautionary than an horror tale about man trying to become God; however in many aspects it respected the fight of man against the darkness of the morals and religion imposed limits of that age.This new version basically retells the classic story giving more importance to Frankenstein assistance Igor; than the original movies gave; but is still Victor (and his madness) story.The movie ends (perhaps a little to abrupt) few minutes after the monster is created; which is a pity because the second part is as much interesting as the second and full of grave concerns about human nature.In any case; Paul McGuigan (the director) keeps the movie always interesting with elaborated action scenes, a few comic situations, lots of suspense but mostly because of the excellent chemistry between the two main characters.Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy gives two outstanding performances as Igor and Victor Frankenstein. While the first is required a very physical acting as the deformed Igor the second has to make believable a borderline, sometimes hideous but still charismatic scientific. Both give a lot of themselves and make the movie works.In brief; if you liked the Boris Karloff movies; this one will not disappoint you. Is well structured and somewhat updated retell with lots of respect on the original. If you are not familiar; this will like you; but let's hope the second is someday made in order to appreciate the whole novel.",Victor Frankenstein
64,CANpatbuck3664,"I Liked It Better Than I Expected To, It Benefits A Lot From James McAvoy Giving It His All",7,12 March 2016,"I wanted to see this in theatres but with the low box office gross, it was gone before I could get there. It seemed like a cool twist on the story, having more of a buddy cop take on it. I have to admit ahead of time I haven't read Mary Shelley's novel so I can't speak to how the movie changed the story from the source material. I wanted to give it a chance though, it has a good cast and from the trailers it looked like it had a steam punk vibe similar to Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman. Having low expectations often helps and while I can see flaws in Victor Frankenstein it was still a fun, escapist blockbuster.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The opening of the movie is our introduction to the man who will be Igor (Daniel Radcliffe). He is a hunchback, he has no name and he works as a clown in a circus. He is treated badly by the other performers but he bides his time and studies human anatomy. He secretly has a keen intellect and serves as the show's doctor. The one light in his life is Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is an acrobat in the same show. He admires her from afar however. One night during a performance in London she falls and faces a life threatening injury. From out of the audience runs in Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) who is a medical student at a nearby college. Between the two of them they figure out how to fix her collapsed lung and save her life. Victor is astounded by the hunchback and asks him to leave the circus to work with him but before he can say yes, the owner laughs and throws him in a cage, claiming that he is circus property. Victor finds him and frees him but they are pursued by the rest of the circus performers. There is a chase sequence and they get away but one of the other performers is accidentally killed in the chaos.They get to Frankenstein's lab which is in an apartment above a soap factory. The hunchback thanks Victor for his help and Victor claims that he wants to fix him. Victor deduces that his deformity isn't a birth defect it's actually an abscess and he syphons the fluid from it and gives him a back brace to help him walk normally. The performer is grateful for the help but Frankenstein then departs to work on his own. He inadvertently tells him that he's probably being hunted so they should actually give him a name. They decide on Igor after Frankenstein's former roommate who has been missing.I think when you watch this movie, it's easy to see what the crew were trying to achieve. The most obvious comparison is to the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies. They're going after that sort of team dynamic with the two leads playing off each other with funny dialogue and a strong sense of friendship. I think this is an interesting choice and I think it works here. Frankenstein and Igor are a likable pair and you get to see different things happening because they see events in different ways. It's not true to the source material, I get that but in terms of putting a new twist on a classic novel (the movie even reminds you of that through stating it out loud that you know the story already) I think they took it in cool direction. I also liked the costumes, the set design and the visual style of the movie, it was obvious that they didn't have a big budget but they seemed to put it to good use creating the fun steam punk feel that the feature has.The other big reason that gives this movie life is that James McAvoy is really giving 110% as Victor Frankenstein. He's carrying this movie through the slower scenes just because of the energy in his performance. It's really the biggest reason that this movie is entertaining. I also liked Daniel Radcliffe as Igor. His acting only seems off through comparison to James because he's not chewing the scenery like McAvoy is. Daniel is more low key and that's fine, he works well with James in their scenes together. Jessica Brown Findlay is also good but she's given very little to do. I was disappointed in Andrew Scott's performance as Inspector Turpin. He lacked the enthusiasm that was needed for his character as the adversary of Victor Frankenstein. But he also could have been weighed down by the character not being very strong in the first place.As much as I enjoyed the movie, it did have problems. The action scenes aren't all that interesting or well filmed (Victor pulls out some fancy fighting moves at times, how did he learn that being a medical student?). I think the movie also runs out of steam by the ending. The climax is goofy and doesn't gel with the rest of the story. I also thought the character motivations are believable but they flip completely on a dime or they grow into strange variations of what they started out as (Turpin especially, he goes from a smart and seasoned detective to a religious fanatic at the end, they tell you why but I don't think that justifies what he does).With how badly this movie was panned, I wasn't expecting much from Victor Frankenstein. I was enjoying it halfway through as a fun and imaginative take on an old story but by the time the ending came around, it was hard to stomach. Thank goodness it had McAvoy in there, he made you want to see what would come next. I feel like I'm being a little soft on this movie but I want to be positive because I think it's unfairly being slammed for trying to find something new instead of sticking to being faithful adaptation.",Victor Frankenstein

The idea that he was an abused circus freak added a beautiful eye pleasing start to this film. There were some fun and creative scenes...and a few great Victorian costumes...and even some believable additions, like that Victor Frankenstein would experiment on animals first before delving in to humans, but in the end the story fizzled out and didn't really hold my interest. This was a shame because it did start with a lot of promise and McAvoy did a wonderful job playing the crazed Dr.Frankenstein. It did end on an interesting note that leaves Igor getting the girl and Victor going off to potentially start his experiments all over agin...maybe.

This film shows the duo's relationship, and how they came to make the creature we have known so well for several decades. Igor is an eccentric fellow, highly passionate about his work. Same goes for Radcliffe's nameless man. Their enthusiasm is infectious. We're more than welcome to this party. Three (us being the third) is NOT a crowd!

71,TheRedDeath30,Much Better than Expected,6,29 April 2016,"I think it's a fairly obvious statement to say that our opinions of movies are tempered quite a bit by our expectations of that movie. How many times have we seen some indie darling hailed as the next great horror film, only to be let down and disappointed. In the end, the movie is probably better than we're letting on, but it didn't meet the weight of its' reputation. In some ways, my opinion of this movie is the opposite of that reaction. The reviews were bad. The movie bombed. I had just about zero expectations and, perhaps, that is why I found it to be much better than expected and, as a result, find myself giving it a much higher rating that I ever expected.We all know the story of Frankenstein and his monster, but this film really takes that well tread blueprint and crafts an entirely new monster from it (sorry for the bad pun). I found myself reminded a lot of Hammer's series of Frankenstein films. Before you lose your mind with me making that comparison, I do not think it to be near the quality of THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, but am speaking of the subject matter. Hammer's series was always much more about the doctor than any creation he brought to life. The mad scientist was the main focus and that is clearly the case in this version, albeit with the adding extra of Igor.We begin our film in a circus where Igor is a clown/ freak who is tormented by his compatriots. An accident occurs that injures the woman he has pined for from afar and brings all the forces of this movie together. It is here that we meet Doc Frank and the result of the events that transpire, also, introduce us to the police detectives who are integral to the movie's plot. The film almost lost me in this opening as it was just much too sleek and modern, trying far to hard to pander to the superhero movie fan. The slo-mo capture shots and frantic action felt much too out of place and not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the movie.This extends to the next scenes, as well, where our doctor rushes about his laboratory breathlessly, while instantly healing Igor of his affliction in sudden, brutal ways that have no expectation. Why did he need to do it this way? Could he not have explained some things and taken his time? It came off far too much as action for the sake of action with no thought to what it added to the script. Fortunately, the movie settles into a groove, though, that I did find to be interesting. Doc Frank is a student with a father that disapproves of everything about him and a dark secret in his past that drives him towards his unholy experiments. Igor (played by Harry Potter) is the heart of the movie and the real hero. He is thrust into a world of science and gentleman's culture where he comes upon his true love. These two actors are the stars of this movie and the reason that it is successful in the end. We grow to like their characters, understand their motivations and almost root for them to finish their ghastly experiment.In pursuit of them are two police detectives, one of whom is hell bent on ending their work, holding it to be blasphemous. He becomes the actual villain of the movie as he blindly pursues the doctor and his assistant at the cost of all else. We do not actually meet our monster until the closing minutes of the movie, finally getting to the parts that we all expect from the beginning. I will say that the monster (called Promotheus here, in a nod to Shelley), is pretty impressive. I know a lot of classic monster purists who will hate the design, but they would hate anything that isn't Jack Pierce's classic green giant. This monster is impressive in scale and hews a fine line between paying homage to the classic designs and creating something new.If you are hellbent on being a hater and know you'll despise this for not being Universal or Hammer, then just stay away in the first place. I was really skeptical as I tend to hate this sort of modern retelling, but in the end I found that it really drew me in and left me much more impressed than I ever thought I would be with a modern monster movie.",Victor Frankenstein
72,Jerghal,Fun film if you don't take it too seriously,7,2 March 2016,"I'm not happy whit the endless remake fever of Hollywood but the trailer for this one didn't look to bad so I gave it a shot. The angle here is that we experience the story from the viewpoint of Igor, who is a hunchback circus-clown slash doctor who is set free by Frankenstein to aid in the making of 'the monster' (you know the story). They try to make it a bit more hip and smooth (think the Sherlock Holmes versions of Guy Ritchie). It's best not to take the movie to seriously coz let's be honest it's all a bit silly so you have to go along with it. Radcliffe's acting is decent and McAvoy choose to play it big (sometimes borderline overacting) but it fits the movie so no worries. The VFX are pretty good and the production design and sets are nicely crafted so the movie is pretty easy on the eyes. It made little money at the box office so a hint to studio execs: bring something we haven't seen before.

73,FelipeCarrillo,"""It's Alive""",8,24 December 2015,"We are in the era where big companies retake old classics to adapt again and Twentieth Century Fox Film did a decent job with respect to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein. It is completely innocuous and unimportant to mention that Paul McGuigan makes the movie aiming to do for ""Victor Frankenstein"" what Guy Ritchie did for ""Sherlock Holmes"", Victorian London but with a different theme: ""Two men with the ability to generate life"". It is interesting to the reinvention of the classic focuses on Igor more than the same main character disappearing completely cliché that Victor is the center of attention, obviously, without downplay Victor in the movie. More than a story of monsters , religion and beliefs ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a story of true friendship that surpasses any buddy film. Landis' script addresses the issues of life and death in an impressive manner focusing not just on the name "" Frankenstein "" also in his friend "" Igor"" . This script takes the essentials of classical achieving a memorable tribute to the most fearsome monster of Hollywood. The script and the effects are a key part to connect the film with the audience but clearly are the actors who work for the reborn: Radcliffe took the right tone to become the shadow of 'Victor' ( perhaps for his dream of medicine expert or in gratitude for his flamboyant remove hump) although at times McAvoy stole the limelight to 'Igor'. The performances of these two ambitious men are truly spectacular, them feelings and differences make the trip that much more fun and entertaining , these two guys deserve a ton of applause. The break point of the movie are ten long minutes, where they are presented many villains, and often the case the bromance ((Jessica Brown Findlay's trapeze artist, Lorelei) appears to exist largely to deflect suspicions that Victor and Igor only have eyes for each other (not counting the eyes in formaldehyde, of course). ""Gordon"" and ""Prometheus"" (the first experiments of them ) are shown in a majestic manner , with a dark touch but with a careful hand of details that make each look truly amazing . However , the end is not the best, but leaves the door open for a possible franchise, that according to public reaction (Box Office) and apparently , it is very unlikely to see a sequel due to the few gains so far over budget. ""Victor Frankenstein"", really surprised , managing to show a new face of classic , fresh it , and exceeding what we had in mind. Innovative, refreshing , exciting and totally unbelievable becomes the new invention of ""Victor and Igor"".",Victor Frankenstein
74,gareth-75442,Meh. Not what it should have been,4,7 October 2020,"Told from Igor's perspective, this is a
seriously underwhelming take on the classic story, even the ending with all the ridiculous explosions & OTT performances culminating in the death of the ""monster"" literally minutes after gaining life.Quite simply this didn't live up to what it should have been, the story of the brilliant scientist & his decent into madness & ultimately his death at the hands of his creation as seen through the eyes of igor, shelley's original story had no such character, Victor frankenstein had no lab assistant, the character was introduced in the 1931 movie ""Frankenstein"" a hunchback lab assistant by the name of fritz, the movie also introduced the idea of using lightning to create electricity to imbue the ""monster"" with life, again this was not from shelley's novel, in shelley's novel the character Victor Frankenstein spent several years piecing together his creation & it was brought to life using the unknown secret to life he had discovered
This movie suffered from far too much screen time of each character trying to out perform each other & the ridiculous ""Hollywood"" big explosion ending was laughable instead of meaningful.You would think that with a rather small budget of $65 million this movie would have at least broke even instead of making a loss of $30 million.Really have no idea what Max Landis had in mind with the script other than telling the tale of Victor Frankenstein & his friend the "" Guy Ritchie way"" which is rather boring, reducing the involvement of the ""monster"" down to a few minutes at the end was a huge mistake, very few people read the novel for anything other than the ""monster"", even less watch a movie for anything other than Frankenstein's ""monster"" , the mistake with this production is thinking an audience would be interested in the scientist & the characters around him.Max Landis is clearly a very talented young man but this movie simply had no heart or soul, had ""Igor"" been the hunchback overworked under appreciated lab assistant & the story was told from his perspective it would probably have been interesting even entertaining, which this movie is not, let's hope he does a better job with the remake of the classic ""an American werewolf in London"".",Victor Frankenstein

The fixation on Igor's character, played by Daniel Radcliffe, felt excessive and eventually boring; whole it served as an interesting and sentimental overture at the beginning of the movie, it gradually bogged down ""what could've been."" Victor, magnanimously portrayed by James McAvoy, was a far more engaging character - as we shouldn't be surprised - but most of the film seemed too concentrated on Igor. That said, it certainly had its thrills, more so in the first half, but the overlong climax of the ""monster"" itself literally had me heavy-eyed. I can only recommend this if you're either a huge fan of McAvoy, Radcliffe, or, possibly, Mary Shelley's story. That said, as a huge fan of McAvoy, I was somehow unfulfilled.

A mad scientist named Victor von Frankenstein, with help from his friend Igor, manage to reanimate a corpse consisting of different parts from different bodies. A monster, if you will. From a storytelling perspective, Victor Frankenstein is as run-of-the-mill as you can get. The only unique aspect is that it's told from Igor's perspective, which isn't much different since Victor is still a large part of the story. We all know what's going to happen. Even the first line is, ""You know this story,"" and it proceeds to tell it to us again. The only conceivable reason I can think for this movie's existence is for the performances. James McAvoy is excellent as the mad genius, and Radcliffe does a fine job as his right-hand man. Andrew Scott is always nice to see, playing another antagonistic role as the inspector assigned to Frankenstein's case. And Charles Dance makes a small cameo for some reason as Victor's disapproving father. But the bulk of the movie revolves around Victor and Igor, as you can imagine, and it's exactly what you would expect, beat by beat.Victor Frankenstein is not a bad movie in the traditional sense. If this was the first telling of this story, it would be a perfectly serviceable standalone film. But since it's so well-known, nothing about Victor Frankenstein is memorable.

While essentially a Gothic action movie, the chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy is good, but the film steadily comes apart at the seams (poor stitching?) due to the increasing number of characters that progressively appear, such as the dogged police detective, a romantic love interest, and a hastily tacked on villain with a rather undeveloped motive. As such, the narrative is never fully complete and feels lacking in terms of plot. This is especially evident in the finale in which Victor strangely seems to bring his creation to life within a Bond villain's secret lair (that indeed pretty much ends up exploding). Further, the hurried nature of the final act may be due to reedits as Mark Gatiss suddenly appears from nowhere, and has but one brief line, which seems odd if you are going to recruit one of the famed League of Gentleman, so I suspect his role was initially more substantial. However, the reanimated creature gets a little bit of 'Hulk smash!"" action, and actually looks pretty good. So, a enjoyable enough film, but in the end even Victor Frankenstein could not fully animate all of the disparate parts and make them come to life, and like the monster chimp that runs amok in said film, it all just kind of runs out of energy.",Victor Frankenstein
81,malmborgimplano-92-599820,My Little Franklock: Science and Friendship are Magic,10,29 November 2015,"I liked this, but then I'm (a) weird and (b) a massive fan of Steven Moffat's ""Sherlock"" and series of ""Doctor Who,"" especially the current Capaldi era. There's enough crossover here with ""Sherlock,"" with the director Paul McGuigan having directed most of the best episodes of ""Sherlock"" as well as inventing the technique of expressing its genius protagonist's thoughts on screen in the form of graphics (also used here to illustrate the ingenious ideas of Victor and Igor) as well as ""Sherlock"" cast members Andrew Scott, Mark Gatiss, and Louise Brearly, for it to count as part of the ""Sherlock"" canon. The fact that the Creature that Victor and Igor design has two hearts sort of ties it into the Whoniverse as well.I have a theory that McGuigan would have liked Andrew for the role of Igor but was told that if he wanted McAvoy for Victor he'd have to get a marquee name for Igor. Which is fine: Daniel Radcliffe is adorable in the role and Andrew gets a break from being adorable in his stern grown-up role.I do think there was a deliberate choice here to transfer the paradigm of Sherlock and John's complex working friendship into that of Victor and Igor--like John, Igor is a lost soul rescued by the friendship of a socially backward but brilliant and sort of even heroic man, though the comparison sort of stops there. James McAvoy's Victor bears no resemblance to Cumberbatch, either as Sherlock or Frankenstein, and he's an original as far as screen Frankensteins go, a fiery, passionate man full of infectious joy in the act of creation. He's really fun to watch.Since the film's bombed at the box office there won't be any sequels, but there's rich material here for fanfics so the cultists who will inevitably be drawn to this film and get it despite its sub-zero ratings on Rotten Tomatoes will take care of that. Thanks in advance.",Victor Frankenstein
82,rstef1,Hot Mess,4,12 March 2016,"As most of you have already guessed, this version has about as much to do with the novel Frankenstein as Groovie Goolies has to do with NASCAR. It has an overzealous character named Victor Frankenstein who is determined to create life by reanimating stitched together body parts from corpses. All similarities end there.Just because the movie doesn't follow the book doesn't make it necessarily bad. The original Universal film strayed from the source material and Hammer's fine version also moved far afield from the novel. The difference is that those two films had terrific scripts and tight storytelling which generated suspense (if not scares), and made us care about the characters. Paul McGuigan's directorial effort is just a slapdash, hodgepodge of situations, big pyrotechnics and foolish scripting, though he keeps things moving at a brisk pace.The movie gives a wink and a nod to the Universal films by tossing in an inspector investigating Frankenstein who loses his hand, although in the original it was an arm, and to the monster and not in a fight with Frankenstein. Hammer's Frankenstein is also referenced in a scene involving a pair of headless eyes in a tank which follow a match. The script tries hard to be clever by transforming Igor (another character created by Universal) into a leading man when his hump turns out to be a large cyst! The scene is gross but not really fun, just overheated and ridiculous. Most of the film tries to keep up this overheated, manic behavior and situations. In the end it's just tiring and uninvolving. The only person we get to care about is Igor, and even that is due less to the script and more to Daniel Radcliffe who, God bless him, does his best with a paper thin character who comes off like an idiot toward the final reel for his unwavering devotion to Frankenstein, which doesn't seem warranted after his treatment. McAvoy chews the lovely scenery as the title character and appears to be having a good time. I suppose he welcomed this after playing a sensible, stalwart hero type in the X-Men movies.In the end the movie is defeated by its size and sturm und drang. If it had chosen to narrow its scope, focus and ambitions, it could have been more fun. The cinematography is very nice, all the performances are fine, if occasionally over the top, though all the supporting characters are given almost nothing to do and are one-note personalities. The sets and setting are lovely. Sadly it went for the big box office Christmas holiday type entertainment with a story that really doesn't call for it, and failed.",Victor Frankenstein

Victor Frankenstein, played by James Mc Avoy, is the mad scientist who wants to create life from death. His assistant Igor, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is a rescued circus freak who happened to be a genius physician. Together the two of them worked endlessly to create new life. So they pieced together parts from various animals together to create the new being. But to give it life, it was possible by electricity giving it a kick start. The first creature was mainly made out of a chimpanzee's body, and man was it deformed and evil. It really looked like Koba from the Planet of the Apes movies, but after he was hit by a freight train twice.Towards the end of the movie, the Frankenstein monster was finally brought to life. But he really did not have that much of a life. It lasted all of four minutes before he was killed by his creators. All that for nothing.

87,michael-3204,Maybe next time...Victor/Victoria Frankenstein?,3,19 July 2016,"It must be tough to figure out where to tread on ground that has been so well trod. The idea behind this version is to focus on the relationship between the friendly neighborhood mad scientist and his assistant Igor, who in this telling Victor rescues from mistreatment in a circus. There is a half-hearted thematic attempt to equate Igor, played well enough by Daniel Radcliffe, with Frankenstein's more famous creation, here called Prometheus, but it falls flat, as does the rest of the movie.The main problem is the title character, who is so misconceived, so annoying and insufferable, as to make you wonder why anyone would give him the time of day, let alone want to make or even watch a movie about him. James McAvoy goes full-throttle playing up Victor's essential obnoxiousness and gives what must be the worst performance of his career. I'm not really sure what else he could do with the role, but robbing Victor of anything resembling humanity doesn't do the character or the story justice. If there was anything else interesting going on here, McAvoy might not be such a sore thumb. Unfortunately, the other characters are pure cardboard and do whatever the plot requires instead of doing what actual human beings would do. The creature itself, when it finally emerges, won't make anyone forget Boris Karloff. He is as dull as the rest of the film.",Victor Frankenstein
88,tranat71,Best Frankenstein Movie I have ever seen,10,28 February 2016,"This is the best Frankenstein movie I have ever seen.I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows pertaining to Victor Frankenstein and his monster. And I enjoy watching Victor Frankenstein (2015) more than anything I've seen. :DWhile I think most Frankenstein movies have focused mainly on the Frankenstein Monsters, this new movie focuses mainly on Igor & Victor Frankenstein the people. We see both Igor's and Victor's characters develop throughout the movie, which is I think is really refreshing. Igor's character developed the most, but we also see Victor's character development. And there is also that very important romance element between Ignore and the beautiful girl. IMO, no movie can be fully enjoyable with some romance. IMO, the hero should always get that beautiful girl and they should live happily ever after. :DOf course, no Frankenstein movie would be complete without the monster, and this movie actually has not just one monster, but 2 monsters, which is also different than most Frankenstein movies. In addition, the ultimate monster creation is quite unique in terms of physiology. It's insanely awesome in terms of anatomy IMO. I absolutely love it. :DSo although ""Victor Frankenstein"" may not be Oscar worthy in the eyes of most people, I unequivocally enjoy the heck out of it and would say it is among my favorite movies. I would also say that it is unequivocally the best Frankeinstein movie I have ever seen.",Victor Frankenstein
89,paulspencer-90394,"Good, but could have been so much more",6,19 February 2016,"A lot of people slated the film before it even came out. And it is easy to see why. The old save the cat principle of making us care for the good guy seems to have been forgotten. We have two protagonists who do their best not to give us any reason to like them. Everyone does a lot of talking, to the point that you forget at least half of what they are saying.Macavoy is good, but you can see him acting in pretty much every scene. Radcliffe tries his best, but this is not a buddy movie, and he is the supporting actor, so we are left wondering what is going on when the film begins to focus mainly on him.So the fault lies in the script and the director. I can imagine that the original script was a good story about Igor and his relationship with the doctor and the monster (and how he is an assimilation of both). And how his love is spurned. But clearly this was not good enough for a film, and so we have Frankenstein, creating life, with all its thunderbolts and lightning.So there are times it feels like a television show. A period drama that could of been a series, but someone decided to mix three scripts into one.The best thing about watching this movie was that I started writing my own script about James Whale creating The Bride of Frankenstein in 1935, full of anti homosexual and anti communist subtext. I hear they remaking the actual Bride of Frankenstein, but I fear that like this film, it will be too lame for a younger audience, and too bland for an older audience.A nice try at thinking outside the box, but if you are going to do that, then try and create something new rather than trying to bring to life something that has been dead for years.",Victor Frankenstein

92,kimheniadis,"If you love the classic, you probably won't love this movie.",7,16 April 2016,"My book club read Frankenstein last year, and while it was interesting, it was also drawn out, and boring in some parts. Since this is a movie version of it, the pace is much faster, and they took a lot of liberties with the book. In fact there is very little of the book remaining. But I didn't find that to be a bad thing, since this was an interesting re-telling of the story.The biggest difference is that in the book, Dr. Frankenstein does not have an assistant, especially not a humpback named Igor. Daniel Radcliffe's character does compliment the story, and allows us to see into Dr. F's mind, by him being the caring one, while Dr. F. can be the crazy one. In the book Dr. F. was both caring and crazy, but whereas you can read this description in the book, it would have been a lot harder to portray it in the movie.Igor doesn't stay a hunchback very long though, and what Dr. F. does to help him, was the most disgusting part of the movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to gag a little. After Igor no longer has his hump, he starts to interact with society, and finds that he enjoys it. This pushes Dr. F. into more of a rage since he feels as if he made Igor the man he now is, and Igor is not helping him as much as he wants.The only part of the movie that was similar to the book (at least that I can remember) is towards the end when Igor is climbing the giant mountain (although in the book, it was the Doctor). This was a pinnacle of tension in the book when the Dr. went to find the monster. In the movie, it was another pinnacle.Although there is very little of the book in this movie, I still really enjoyed it. The action scenes were intense, and the gore was a good amount, and made sense with the plot. Not gore, just for the sake of gore. As long as the classic isn't one of your favorites, I would say give this movie a watch.",Victor Frankenstein
93,ryanmark-57919,Much Better Than I Thought it Would Be,8,2 December 2015,"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I saw the trailers to this movie but I'm actually surprised how much I enjoyed the final product. It's far from perfect but it's such a fun film that I was able to ignore a lot of the flaws. I am a little disappointed that they didn't go ahead and call the movie Igor because that's really who the film is about but I can let it slide. This one is directed by Paul McGuigan, I'm not that familiar with him but he did direct Lucky Number Slevin, which raises him a notch in my book. Let's talk about the story.A young hunchback in a circus later referred to as Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) runs into the mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) when a young trapeze artist has an accident and they work together to save her life. Frankenstein is impressed with the young man's skill and decides to help him get away from the circus. However, Frankenstein isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart. He wants Igor to help him in his experiments to create life using electricity and old dead body parts. Despite some reservations, Igor feels indebted to Frankenstein and decides to help him bring a corpse to life. This turns out to be a very bad idea.Just to be clear, I'm a ridiculously huge James McAvoy fan. Filth and Professor X have truly endeared this man to my heart and I'll watch him in anything. I love the intensity he brings to his role as Victor Frankenstein. I could easily believe that this man is insane and it's great that he doesn't seem to notice the spittle coming out of his mouth on certain scenes. I also enjoyed Radcliffe's Igor more than I thought I would. It's been difficult for this guy to get out of the shadow of Harry Potter but I genuinely like the roles he's taken so far. Igor is a sweet and trusting guy despite his abuse in the circus and Radcliffe gives us that and more. I like that his Igor is much more intelligent than the ones we've had in the past. The only other character that I want to mention is Andrew Scott's Turpin, an incredibly astute and religious detective. This guy also brings an intensity to his role that makes him a bit terrifying. I didn't know whether to root for him or against him but he does have some good points. I'm a little unsure of his methods though. Overall, I actually liked the acting more than I thought I would.London looks fantastic in this movie. The trailers made the film look cheap but the final product is much better in my opinion. Sure, it's grimy, but London is supposed to be filthy looking. I was also surprised to see that they went with some period appropriate music rather than try to bring in something that obviously doesn't fit with the time period ( I'm looking at you Great Gatsby). Even the final reveal of the Monster surprised me because I genuinely liked the look of him. Man, this movie needed some different trailers.Alright, like I said before, the film is not perfect. There are a few sub-plots that didn't really need to be included in the story. I enjoyed the sub-plot with Inspector Turpin but the character of Finnegan came off as completely unnecessary to me. Freddie Fox does a fine job portraying the character but he really doesn't have any purpose other than to be an immoral prick. He does provide funding for Frankenstein's research but I wasn't exactly asking myself how Victor procures money anyway. There are a few other little nitpicks like this one but I don't want to spoil too much of the film. Let's just say that they tried to put way too many sub-plots in what is supposed to be a story about Frankenstein and Igor.Honestly, I thought this movie was awesome despite a few obvious flaws. The acting is great and everything just looks interesting. It's far from perfect but it's a unique retelling of the Frankenstein story and I'm surprised how good it is. I doubt many of you will want to watch it especially when movies like Creed are out right now but if you feel like watching something fun and frivolous then try giving Victor Frankenstein a shot.",Victor Frankenstein
94,bartonj2410,Should have been so much better...,4,6 December 2015,"It's hard not to be cynical about Hollywood sometimes, particularly when it produces films as lazy as Victor Frankenstein, an uninspired origin story of Victor Frankenstein and his assistant, Igor Straussman. Before a chance meeting with Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy), a then nameless Igor (Daniel Radcliffe) worked as both a clown and a physician. A medical incident one night at the circus leads to their first meeting and Igor becoming Victor's assistant.Sharing a passion for medical science, the pair embark on a project to bring about life from death. After a few mishaps, Igor feels they should stop but Victor's drive to make a name for himself leads to the most volatile creation that even he thinks is too far.Right from the very beginning, Victor Frankenstein feels all over the place. Paul McGuigan directs the film as if he hadn't made his mind up on what sort of film this should be. Unfortunately, in the end he went with an edgy modern retelling of a classic tale that brutally highlights McGuigan's lack of imagination as a filmmaker.Considering the acting talent in Victor Frankenstein makes it even more of a disappointment. James McAvoy majorly hams it up as Victor, coming across as a mix between Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and David Tennant's Doctor. Daniel Radcliffe, who I've never thought to be a very good actor, takes a step backwards with his portrayal of Igor, with awkward line delivery and no chemistry being his main problems here.They also manage to waste Andrew Scott, most famous for playing Moriarty in BBC's Sherlock, as a police detective on the tail of Victor. His character is so underwritten that Scott has little room to manoeuvre and ends up delivering one hell of a monotonous performance.Max Landis' story lacks any real punch and his script is daft yet not totally void of quality which, considering the history of this story that he had to work with, is a real shame. There are some good visual effects that lead to some entertaining moments and Craig Armstrong's score is a rare highlight in this ultimately disappointing film.I pray to God that the last scene isn't one that means we are going to get a sequel mind, because that is really what we could do without.",Victor Frankenstein

Igor is taken in by Victor Frankenstein; His life flips upside down, they become a team, and we, the audience continue to follow the adventures, as well as embodiment of these two characters, as they both create a scientific breakthrough. Or in this case, reanimation. Honestly, I found this movie to be a little misspoken for. I can see where many were expecting non - stop occurrences with the reanimated creature we've all come to know and love. Before anything else of this review, there is little of that. But here's the thing, does that make this entire thing bad? No. This film was actually creative, and quite good. First off, I honestly love the charm, and creativity of this story. The entire execution of the film's telling of this entire tale, I found to be flawless. The entire telling fell within the amazing character chemistry between Igor, and Victor. Which, by the way, both Daniel Radcliffe, and James McAvoy had amazing chemistry together. You could watch, and feel the connection their characters, if that, actors shared together. The characters in this film, while on the topic, were all around great. I can't emphasize this enough, horror, if that, thriller's now, usually have unlikeable characters - But not here. This film has characters that you could actually bare with, characters that'll you'll grow to, and actually bond with, sharing feelings for their actions. Of course, however, you have a small collection of characters you grow to dislike, but of course by intend of the film itself. I personally found the entire, overall plot, and storyline to be charming. I found the rescue, and bonding of savior friendship between Igor, and Victor to be all around charming, and just flat out awesome. It thrills us, audience, while at the same time develop feelings for the characters. Moving to visual elements, first of all, I honestly loved the entire visual effects of this film. I felt as if it was beautiful, and succeeded in giving us a flat out, solid display of the Victorian era, or in other words steam-punk. It felt intriguing to look at, visual eye-candy as far as the eye can see, giving an attention - grabbing effect. The camera work compliments as well, giving us some pretty well placed shots of which show the action sequences, as well as the meaningful ones. Lastly. I honestly liked the creations. The re-animated figures looked distorted, something they're supposed to succeed at. It didn't look cheap, and honestly was great for the time they came around, with their grotesque features, not too gory, or disgusting, but at the same time not too light, or cheap. In conclusion, this film succeeds in a pleasant surprise. Once again, I can see where people get disappointed, as we see barely any real ""Frankenstein"" or in this case, the reanimated monster, at least not as much as many may of expected. However, the film succeeded in dismissing that, as we're giving many succeeding elements, including stunning visual effects, great, likable characters. I fun, at the same time thrilling story, and an overall unique charm that doesn't disappoint.

The only woman involved, an acrobat named Lorelei, a name which firmly establishes her in a fantasy realm, acts as a beard for an elderly gentleman who enjoys the company of men.Like in a 40s movie, hunchback/clown Igor (Daniel Ratcliffe) hopelessly looks at her flying far above the dirty ground he's confined to. Enters the titular character (James McAvoy), and the two men instantly spot each other. One thinks it is called doctordar. Oh, did one mention Igor is also a doctor? It takes one to know one, see. After a slow mo escape really worth watching to confirm what depths Hollywood is now fathoming after Van Helsing and Sherlock Holmes, Victor initiates Igor against a pillar with a piercing toy. Their bond is sealed: Igor is now allowed to wear a harness and call Victor ""Master"". Good dog.But back to science and the essence of life and death. Frankenstein delivers a first presentation to the Royal Academy of Medicine, a strictly male club heralded by a blond twink in an astrakhan coat. it is a fiasco and the creature escapes, only to die of misconception. Free from such biological hurdles, the movie goes on. Victor's father thinks he has made the wrong choice of life. Igor attempts to make out with a zombi baboon. This being shocking even by Victorian standards, the blond twink has him thrown in the Thames.Victor and Sherlock share their nemesis: Andrew Scott (here Inspector Turpin, there Moriarty, cringe-inducing in both parts). Dialogue goes rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb, as it is virtually impossible to make a Frankenstein movie without regurgitating at least part of Mary Shelley's garbage about life and death, God-defying science and the true nature of soul, all things very cinematic. The two nevertheless engage in ethical debate while Turpin has his hand crushed by wheel works.The second presentation, with the whole Royal Academy of Medicine contributing to the creation of a stronger creature, with two sets of lungs and two hearts, takes place in a tower atop a cliff. It even has a chain bridge for Gothic effect. ""The storm is upon us!"", urges Victor. Igor climbs up with his bare hands because he really, really needs Master to punish him. They look at each other in rapture. Igor suspects Victor's attempt at creating a beefcake is rooted in the death of his elder, manlier brother. Victor flinches. ""The storm is almost upon us!"" he digresses.Not unlike in a submarine movie (this long, hard thing full of seamen), most of the dialogue is repeated twice. Last part of the process involves nipple clamps (""Lazarus forks"" for the initiated) and a crew of steam-punk extras acting busy. ""Prometheus ascending!"" screams Victor at the top of his lungs. Did one mention the storm is upon us?The movie grand finale is indeed a crap storm. Turpin barges in to kill the creature; even though he has a clear shot he keeps yelling ""Get out of the way Frankenstein!"". Maybe spatial logic is not the director's strong suit. There is a fire and a ninja fight; as an angelic choir rolls in all casualties have vanished but the creature. It ends with a letter saying one thing and its contrary.

102,greg-e-porter,"Victor Frankenstein is so bad it makes me wonder if filmmakers (actors or otherwise) regret participating in movies from time to time; it's not fun bad, just bad bad.",1,28 April 2016,"Daniel Radcliffe provides the voice over introduction to Victor Frankenstein. ""You know this story... The world, of course, remembers the monster, not the man. But sometimes, when you look closely, there's more to a tale. Sometimes the monster is the man.""Did that just blow your mind?!But, wait, isn't that kinda the whole point of the book?Now, I'm not knocking the movie for attempting to do something different but what Victor Frankenstein is doing feels really lazy. It's not like they are reinterpreting the story or some of the major themes, it's mostly just a recasting of superficial elements..Now, the crux of the movie is, well, about Victor Frankenstein (McAvoy) and Igor (Radcliffe) as they struggle with the technical and ethical quandaries of reanimating life. In this iteration of the story, Igor is an abused clown in a steampunk circus. In his free time, he studies medicine. One thing leads to another and the young medical student, Frankenstein, recruits the clown to be a laboratory assistant.The graphics and special effects are perfectly ordinary. Style-wise, we have a steampunk feel. If you aren't familiar with steampunk, it's Victorian England with, potentially, futuristic technology; it has a lot of bronze work and pipes and steam.I mean, Victor Frankenstein is big budget flick aimed at us millennials. Let me tell you, we love steam-punk. It just feels like the decision of the marketing department to stylize the movie this way. There are other decisions that make me feel like this was marketed towards millennials but I'll get more into that later.The dialog is dismal and it doesn't help that everyone phones in their performance. Well, everyone except for James McAvoy, he's just overacting the heck out of his role. He was so pleasant in X-Men: First Class why is he doing this?The story itself, at least the direction in this film, was disappointing. I'll go into detail in a bit but, without spoiling anything here, it will suffice to say that it was a let down.Overall, I would recommend that you actively avoid Victor Frankenstein. It's bad acting in a bad adaptation with tired art direction. Go and see Van Helsing if you want a supernatural but light and fun movie.Now, let's discuss this movie in a little more detail -- so mind yourself of spoilers.I mentioned that this movie was geared towards millennials. Let me describe the plot a little more. So we have Igor, the character to whom we are supposed to relate. He's just a guy who is really interested in medicine. Unfortunately, he's trapped in an abusive world (the circus). He's saved by Frankenstein and given the opportunity to do great things.We have Frankenstein whose all for science; he's the ""God is dead because science is awesome!"" type of guy. I get the feeling that he's supposed to be ""cool"" because he's an atheist but he gets a little too carried away with his experiments for us to gravitate towards him. Meanwhile, a dogmatic, fundamentalist Christian inspector (Scott) pursues the protagonists. The inspector is definitely bad because he's like our parents.This leaves us in the middle with Harry Potter (Igor, that is). He wants to study medicine and science because it's interesting. He's neither an angry atheist nor a Christian; he's more of an agnostic. This quality of the plot reminds me of what I understand of the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche.In his one book, he describes a shift in power dynamics in society. In the medieval period, we had knights and dukes and lords - the ""nobility."" The nobility had the power because they took it and fought to keep it; they were like hawks. They were to whom we were to aspire. Hence, being ""noble"" is a positive trait.But, if they were so great and powerful, why did the system topple? It failed because of what Nietzsche calls ""slave morality."" The slaves who opposed this feudal system didn't actively rebel they just passively shuffled their feet until the system crumbled. In the metaphor where the nobles are the hawks, the slaves are the sheep. It's a sort of passivity or apathy that characterizes the sheep. Before I get into how this ties into the movie, I feel like should note that one of the things about Nietzsche is that there are problematic ways to interpret his ideas, case and point, the Nazis. For our purposes, I'm pointing out some of the characteristics that he describes with respect to the movie.Igor, for example, wants to do science because it's cool. He's OK with reanimating animals but he mildly objects to reanimating a human. He says that he doesn't want to participate anymore but he doesn't really give a reason why. His reasons certainly aren't the same as the fundamentalist inspector. He doesn't actively support or oppose the experiments either. He just says, 'I'm going away with my girlfriend.' After all, it's a whole lot easier to abstain than to give a definite answer.We have these driven characters but are left with the one standing still. Consider the final lines of the movie. Frankenstein writes Igor saying, ""I'm continuing with my experiments Be ready because I'll call on you someday"" Frankenstein's experiments are where it's at, that's where I want to be. I don't want to be with Igor as he just shuffles about.Gah! There's the rub. Maybe the reason I'm writing and thinking about this so much is because it hits close to home. The reason it's frustrating though is because the film doesn't provide anything satisfying. There's no insight or direction or call to arms. It's just a character that resonates with a target audience and that's that.So, in summary, don't see Victor Frankenstein. It's a stupid movie and writing about it has made me mad.Stupid Victor Frankenstein >:|",Victor Frankenstein
103,elle_kittyca,"Goofy, campy and a bit too ""sherlock"", but fun",6,21 March 2016,"There were moments when I thought this movie might be really really good. Those moments passed, and the complaints that I have about it are a bit contradictory. For me, first and foremost, its a bit too campy. There's a lot of Sherlock-esque slapstick camaraderie. Along with the goofiness, the medical inconsistencies were a bit too silly. Yes, i understand that the underlying premise of the movie is medically improbable, but you think they would make a more coherent story than an 18 year abscess. There were times when I thought the writers just didn't make an effort! A few too many poorly written diversions were also thrown in in order to add create action and add time. If they had been a bit less sloppy, they might have raised some existential issues worth consideration.In the other hand, a few of the more modern aspects were interesting. I liked some of the departure from the book in terms of how the assistant ended up with the doctor. I liked the visualizing of the internal organs and bones when the doctor looked at living matter. The costumes were also great.In short, i wish this had been about 50% less silly, and the plot more coherent. The actors were both entertaining (although Igor was not always believable, he was at least hot).I keep waffling on whether or not to give it a 5 or 6.",Victor Frankenstein
104,TalulaGrey,**Contains Spoiler**,1,2 March 2016,"First let me tell you that I didn't make it all the way through this movie. I tried, I really did. It was not that the actors were bad because they were not, although I have seen them do better work. I know that when you watch a movie you are to suspend belief and roll along with the protagonist BUT I COULD NOT. Especially after Victor tells 'the hunchback with no name' that he has no hunchback, instead he has an abscess, AND that he has had it for 18 years. Seriously? I am supposed to suspend everything I know about the human body and just accept that this person has had an abscess that had them bent over for 18 years? As if that wasn't bad enough, Victor straightens up the 'hunchback with no name,' and straps on a brace so that he can stand up. For real?? The human body does not work that way. I rather enjoyed the costumes, the set design, and the atmosphere. The acting was not terrible, and at the same time not great. The editing and camera work were pretty lame, and because the actors were not on the ball, I'd say the directing was shabby. I give it one star for costume, set design, and atmosphere.",Victor Frankenstein
105,thatpunkadam,"""It's alive!"" ""Isn't it obvious?""",4,9 December 2015,"""It's alive!"" is perhaps one of the most famous proclamations in popular culture, but after countless attempts to revive Mary Shelly's 19th-century monster for modern audiences, not to mention last years' dreadful I, Frankenstein, the most appropriate follow-up to that very quote comes from the mouth of James McAvoy in this year's Victor Frankenstein, which the title character bluntly states, ""Isn't it obvious?""... In the film's opening minutes this fresh prospective comes to life, as Victor (McAvoy) and Igor (Daniel Radcliffe), escape from the circus after Frankenstein witnesses the anatomy-savvy hunchback save Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay), a beautiful trapeze artist and ignored love interest, after a deathly fall. Super imposed x-rays of bone structure in a blueprint-like effect, slow motion fireworks, freaks with fire-blowing and knife-throwing abilities all make for an inspired opening sequence, which unfortunately fails to prevail into the ensuing 110-minutes runtime.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/12/10/victor-frankenstein-2015-review- indieadam/",Victor Frankenstein
106,lmcressia,You might like it,4,27 November 2017,"I did not care for this movie, but that could be because it just wasn't my type of story. It is the tale of Victor Frankenstein and Igor creating the monster, and it focuses primarily on the events leading up to the creation of the monster, with only the last few minutes dealing with the monster itself. If you like Daniel Radcliff you may like this movie. Personally, I saw him as Harry Potter through the whole film. The movie was heavy on story, but I personally felt the story was ""meh""... That could be biased, however, since I like comedy and/or action mixed in with the story quite a lot, and this was lacking in both. In any case, this movie was not for me, but it could be good for someone who likes the time period, likes stories rooted in inter- personal relationships, or Daniel Radcliff.",Victor Frankenstein
107,adaringdo-1,A short analysis of its failure to connect,5,26 November 2015,"Everyone else has made in depth reviews, but no one had explained why this movie totally fails to live up to its inception. The premise is established early on, Igor's perspective and his love for a woman, as well as the promise - we know what happens in the end. The movie, 50% in, departs into the all to common trash heap of needless violence and leaves Igor standing in the wings doing nothing. What could have been an amazing study in humanity degrades to mindless slashing, screaming, and absurd carnage.It was very disappointing to leave the most interesting characters and plot points in the wings: the love interest of Igor, a brothers immortal bond, the parable of death and life as seen through Igor. The brother could have been a TRUE REVELATION but was cast aside for mindless violence. An original ending would have left Igor staring at the castle just before the ""event"" but not entering. We could have felt the pathos, experienced mystery and dread, actually felt a personal bond with the characters... but no. Mindless spectacle destroyed everything.",Victor Frankenstein
108,gojiseb,It's Still Alive!,8,25 November 2015,"""You know this story. The crackling lightning. The mad genius. An unholy creation.""And so opens up the lastest interpretation of Mary Shelley's legendary novel-turned-pop culture myth. So, what does this version add to the time-tested tale? Surprisingly, a fair amount.An amalgamation of various film versions (taking most of its cues from Universal and Hammer), this film tells the origins of Victor Frankenstein through the eyes of a nameless hunchback who, after a quick and very nasty surgery, is dubbed Igor. It tells the story of how the world around Victor reacts to his experiments, from the conniving entrepeuneur to the over-zealous man of faith trying to stop him. And how does it all hold up? Again, surprisingly really well. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy sparks the film up quite a few notches while Andrew Scott, Jessica Brown Findlay and Freddie Fox all make good work of their admittedly under-developed supporting roles.The direction by Paul McGuigan is energetic and lively, even if the pace is a tad too frenetic at times. The use of practical effects for the monstrosities that our heroes bring to life are impressive to behold and everything is boasted by a powerfully theatrical score by Craig Armstrong and some beautiful production design by Eve Stewart. As I said, pacing is a tad too fast and certain bits of writing could've used some tweaking, but the cast and enthusiastic direction definitely make this a more than worthy entry into the Frankenstein mythos that I will gladly welcome into my collection as soon as it makes its to Blu-Ray/DVD.I'm pleased to say that it is very much alive.",Victor Frankenstein
109,gloriahur,"Creative, exciting story of the makers of Frankenstein",6,26 November 2016,"The beginning of the movie is very interesting and eye-catching. A mad scientist and a genius hunch-backed circus clown works together to create life from death. The colors and setting form the dark, mysterious, exciting moods of the theme, making it quite pleasing to keep watching. The whole movie goes on very quickly and doesn't get much boring also.The actors are also great, but I felt like something's not enough, the characters of the two actors don't fill up the movie, they're not complex enough. I think more realistic emotions and background stories or some contemplation of characters would've made the characters more interesting, especially for Dr. Frankenstein. Igor's some sort of contemplation is shown, but is very light, and Dr. Frankenstein doesn't feel like a main character. His character is too one-dimensional, as the movie only shows how mad and excited he was about the project, without any shown emotion towards anyone or anything in the movie.Also, it feels like the peak isn't reached till the end. Almost all parts of the movie are exciting, but the process building up to the final scene where they perform their experiment isn't shown enough. The story goes off topic at some points, and there are many questions that the movie made the audience ask, but not give an answer to. I think the ending carries the message that the author or the director intended to deliver, but is not enough to make the audience think that that's it- the audience probably expected more and it was too sudden and delusory.",Victor Frankenstein
110,oaspag-71318,Very Surprised in a Good Way. 9 out of 10.,9,6 February 2017,"Hi !I really wanted to see this at the movie theaters, but sadly I never got around/had the time to go and see it; but I finally got to see it at home; Just wow...really impressed, I really thought it would be much milder and just 'ok'...it turned out to be much better than I thought and had envisioned from the trailer. This story is simple and does not need telling, we all know it but briefly, it's about a man who discovers he can make 'life out of death' using electrical power (since all cells function by electrical current), and he does against the law in secrecy in his 'mad lab' by picking up leftover organ parts of dead cadaver animals rotting in a morgue/zoo and piecing them together to ultimately make a huge man 'Alive' called 'prometheus' (later on in the film, their ultimate goal). The film has a nice Macabre vibe to it and it's eerie and nice 'gothic/victorian' 19th century look. During his experiments he decides to go off to a circus and stumbles upon a man who plays a clown in the freak-show circus...an accident happens and they both, together, save a woman from death by doing a respiratory procedure (they both are physicians and 'doctors' of the anatomy, they know it by heart), Victor Frankenstein adopts that man and tells him he will become his partner in crime (since all his done in secrecy as there a British agent who's hellbent on capturing Mr.Frankenstein and Igor (the name given to the man Mr.Frankenstein adopts); that man suffers from a crooked back/hunched back due to a abscess (fluid/puss) and Mr.Frankenstein saves his life/gives him a new life in his home/lab.....together they will build fleshy organs/animals (their first try they show it at the British medical college, to prove that an animal (a sort of enraged monkey) can be created and made 'alive' (by electric shocks starting the heart to beat like a defibrillator); it turns out bad because that sutured- up monkey is killed by them when it turns hostile on them). Igor sees the acrobat woman he saved and admired/loves, they fall in love... Then comes the day where it is creation of Prometheus, the huge man/hunk of flesh using the thunder to animate it, it works but as we know it turns out to be a soul-less monstrosity that is hellbent on killing everything. Mr.Frankenstein then understands his Creations are soulless and thus pointless...A great film...I was surprised there was such a great chemistry between Mr.Frankenstein and Igor...James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe are absolutely Great ! Mr.McAvoy does an incredible acting job, he's tempestuous and sure of himself, he trusts Igor with his life, he exudes great authority, genie, border-insanity and knowledge; Mr.Radcliffe does a nice job as the timid circus crooked clown and into a young man straight up who wants to create something in his life. The woman is also great. The British agent too, also, Mr.Frankenstein's rich young British rival (called Finnegan, Freddie Fox) that offers him to make Prometheus in his castle on a beach coast (that kills Igor by throwing him in the water to drown, but Igor survives), is also great. The CG VFX and prosthetic are incredible such as the monkey creature and Prometheus himself; the 19th century London sets are truly beautiful and beautifully constructed, live or CG set extensions. This is a very high production/budget value film and it show immensely. We even have a brief visit from Mr.Frankenstein's Father (the incredible actor Charles Dance) whom scolds him/slaps him by telling him he brings shame to the family name 'Frankenstein' for creating these science flesh monsters alive and that he wasted his life now...All in all, a great movie that really surprised me, it's a touching story about wanting to accomplish your dreams and accomplishing the impossible (bringing a deal animal/carcass to life, making life out of death), it's a story of deep friendship (Mr.Frankenstein and Igor), and love (Igor and the beautiful intelligent acrobat woman whom tells him he must be careful and watch out for the missteps of Mr.Frankenstein and stand up to him if he's wrong/even if he is his friend, or that Mr.Frankenstein saved his life by liberating him from the freak-show circus (when Igor was trapped there)). Igor knows that and at a certain point (when both are seeked out by the police as outlaws) he has no choice but abandoned Mr.Frankenstein...but he comes back to save him at the castle from doing Prometheus. I really don't understand the very poor rating, it deserved so much more than 6.0...Great film, absolutely loved it ! : 9 out of 10.",Victor Frankenstein

It's all just missing the belief look - you want to go to a movie to forget, to be involved but this doesn't let you do that - its too disjointed from the original story which was perfect and this is not.

112,gornasa,Doesn't deserve the bad reviews at all,8,19 February 2016,"I was shocked to see how bad the reviews were on Rotten Tomatoes. 'Worst movie of the year?' WHAT??? This is the first decent movie I've seen in months (apart from 'Spotlight' but that one is in a different league). There are so many really bad movies out there recently that I almost lost all hope that I will ever see a good movie again. I was very positively surprised with this one. Sure, I've seen a few movies about Frankenstein's monster, I know what happens AFTER the monster becomes alive, but this movie is about what happens BEFORE and I liked how the mad scientist and his obsession were shown here. James McAvoy is a fantastic actor, I'm not a fan of Radcliffe but I actually liked him here as well. I'd say this is a solid drama, with interesting characters and great scenography. I like that there were so many details in the interiors (the machinery and everything else), you can really get a feel for what it must have been like to be a scientist back then. I'm glad this movie wasn't all CG and it actually had a story that made me pay attention throughout till the very end. Of course, there are weaker moments here and there but I can't agree that the story is ludicrous and doesn't add anything new. There's a lot of new here for me, I don't know, maybe other people have seen ALL the movie AND theatre adaptations and they're bored with this whole idea of a monster being raised from the dead (why are they still watching then?) Oh, but what about the 'Black Swan' that's been done to death? Why are they raising this one from the dead all the time and nobody complains?I give 'Victor Frankenstein' 8 stars out of 10 because it's a gripping, very well executed movie. It made me think a few times about the implications and consequences of what Frankenstein was trying to achieve. It isn't just a failed horror movie (Really? Where did you get that idea?), it is an entertaining drama that utilizes props - something not many films do these days - and allows the actors to create a character that we care about. I certainly did care.This movie is far from the 'straight to DVD' category and if you like this type of movies, I'd definitely recommend it. Sure, I've watched some movies because the reviewers were saying 'This movie isn't as bad as others make you believe' and they were actually VERY BAD (think the latest 'Die Hard' aka 'Die already!', as one reviewer noted in the title of his review) but I honestly can't see why anybody would hate 'Victor Frankenstein'. This is a strong, solid movie that's very entertaining and certainly not as forgettable as some will tell you. To be on the safe side, watch the first half an hour. If you decide you hate it, you can skip the rest; if you like it, you might just have a pretty nice evening.",Victor Frankenstein
113,TreeOfWolf,Professor X meets Harry Potter... Almost as epic as it sounds.,8,3 September 2016,"I didn't know who was playing in it, and I was pleasantly surprised.James McAvoy played Viktor Von Frankenstein and also Charles Xavier in the X-Men. I recognized him quickly and I enjoyed his arrogance. He played the mad scientist genius perfectly. He was a good X-Men leader and he was great as the leading role.Daniel Radcliffe played Igor and also Harry Potter. I couldn't stand his arrogance as Harry, I guess the secondary characters where too good and made Harry's character look bad. But I didn't recognize him at all in this movie. I even thought that he was very handsome and screamed ""WHAT!?"" when I saw his name in the end credits. He played the support role marvelously. It made me see the actor in a new light, he's a good one. I noticed a parallel with playing Harry, being abused in a family/circus, taken away and saved... He ends up a loyal friend. He was perfect for the role. He sure can take a beating and humiliations, act like a scared puppy with his big blue eyes... and be a kind person fighting for what he believes is right, even when he has the chance to be bad, even against his friend... but also for his friend. It was beautiful to see the story from his perspective... How thorn he was to be loyally grateful, to want to live his own life and make his own choices, and to avoid committing a terrible wrong...I am glad that they found a way and explanation to fix Igor's spine and make him stand straight, it made the movie more interesting and gave the character more depth than if he was an infirm hidden away from the world in a lab.I liked the obsessive inspector, he reminded me of the one from Jean Valjean ""Les Misérables"", suspecting that he's innocent but doing his job zealously... Being a mindless hunting dog didn't just made innocent suffers, but he made himself suffer in the process too... Warning that being blind by the desire to be perfect can be the reason why you become a failure...There is an arrogant rich guy, so snob and pompous... damn the actor was good at it. It was impressively annoying, I wanted to slap him. Really well played character.I liked the characters and the story... the first monkey monster made me say ""oh god"" a few times... but the Frankenstein monster was a disappointment... but the movie wasn't about him. So he was just a mindless monster who died quickly. There wasn't any depth like the movie ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" where it's not just his body parts that are jumbled up together, but also his soul, and he tries to understand who he is... That movie really horrified me to no end... But Victor Frankenstein had a lighter tone about friendship, it had some horrifying moments, but not enough to be a gore movie.Victor Frankenstein isn't about the monster Frankenstein. It's about Igor trying to be the best friend that he can for Victor, and sometimes it means going against his obsessively stubborn wishes... to steer him in the right direction.It was a very good movie, if you have the right expectations. Don't have any and you'll have a great time~",Victor Frankenstein
114,keilanil,Not for purists but otherwise fascinating and unique perspective of the story,8,5 December 2015,"This movie had a totally unique take on the ""idea"" of Frankenstein. If you're a purist you won't like it because it doesn't follow the book, the monster is different (which I actually thought was more accurate) and the story is about the relationship between Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. Told from Igor's point of view and being as much about who Igor was as it was about Dr. Frankenstein, it was really fascinating. Excellent acting! Radcliffe was a great Igor until about the last quarter where became a little more Harry Potter (poor guy just can't shake that role...). James McEvoy was incredible as Frankenstein. He really played his character well; I saw a slowly going-mad genius instead of seeing any other character he's played (Professor Xavier he was not!), and if it had been the first role I had seen him I would have wondered if he really was a little off his rocker. The inspector was great as well - unfortunately I saw him as Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes and it was hard not to think of him as Moriarty throughout the movie, especially since he kind of morphed into the same sort of control-freak loony as the show progressed so I kept calling him Moriarty in my mind. He was still really good in his role though. Really interesting movie with several hilarious spots to break up the tension - even funnier because of the unexpectedness (though don't let this make you think it's a comedy because it's not, it just has touches of comedy if you have a slightly dark sense of humor). As usual I was about the only one in the theater laughing at these odd little spots and comments that really were outrageously funny. At one point Dr. Frankenstein finally shows Igor one of the creepy little things he's working on and it's the point where any normal person would run screaming or be gagging and you wait for the big reaction and instead get a comment on how it could have been done better. Just the build up, the way you subconsciously know a person should and would react, and then the casual comment are as a combination really funny. It's those sort of weird and twisted little bits in the show that make occasion for random bursts of laughter.I loved LOVED the end - this perspective of the creature was my favorite though I can't really say why without it being a spoiler other than the fact that it fit in with my theological beliefs much more than the book or other versions do. Oh yeah, it was more than a bit gross in parts! A simple medical procedure in the first 15 minutes had me nearly dry heaving! Yeah, I'm that person, show a little bit of mucus or pus or whatever and I'm gagging. If you're a Walking Dead or Game of Thrones fan - you'll be just fine. If you're like me you'll be closing your eyes here and there. Again, don't expect the story in the book. You have the name, you have the ""bringing the dead to life with lightening"" and that's about it for similarity. But because of that there is great opportunity to develop some really interesting characters and they picked the right actors to play the roles. I don't see many movies in the theater; I seldom think they're worth paying that price and would rather wait until they're at redbox, but I have no regrets at having paid full price to see this one.",Victor Frankenstein
115,msecaur,An Unfairly Maligned Film With Lots of Heart,10,1 December 2015,"Despite what the trailers will try and tell you, ""Victor Frankenstein"" is in fact a fairly straightforward, character-driven drama about the relationship between mad scientist Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) and his hunchbacked assistant Igor Strausman (Daniel Radcliffe) that just happens to have a few monsters.Rather than remake the classic story (or should I say monster), ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a prequel revealing the origins of Dr. Frankenstein's most famous experiment. Effectively filling the gaps provided by Shelley's novel, this film provides a ghastly look at his first hideous, soulless attempts at creating life, which predate the sympathetic, flat-topped creature as portrayed by Boris Karloff that we all know and love. That being said, this film owes much more to the film adaptations of Frankenstein than the book itself. A tip-off is the prominent inclusion of Igor, an invention not of Shelley's but of Universal Studios, who cast the incomparable Dwight Frye as Fritz in James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" (1931), which morphed in Ygor and finally Igor in subsequent sequels and adaptations. Bearing a somewhat misleading title, the film is really Igor's story. Working as a nameless freak in a circus due to his physical deformity (which Radcliffe portrays brilliantly; he could be the next Lon Chaney Sr.), he is a stranger to kindness until he meets Victor, who recognizes his brilliant mind and vast medical knowledge. Igor is given a new appearance, a new name, and a new life by his generous benefactor, on the condition that he work as Victor's partner and assistant, bringing his expertise to animating individual body parts for use in the highly-strung medical student's unholy enterprise. Victor, in his megalomania, as the ""creator"" of Igor, demands his complete loyalty, something that is easy for the grateful younger man to give until he strikes up a romance with Lorelei, the aerialist he worshiped from afar during his time at the circus. Slowly, he begins to see beyond his unwavering devotion to the disturbed madness of Victor's mania for creating life out of death.To add to the conflict, Victor and Igor find themselves being pursued by the Javert-like Inspector Turpin (Andrew Scott), who, as a man as consumed by his religion as Victor is by his rejection of it, refuses to rest until he and his ungodly experiments are brought to an end. This gives the film a chance to explore the cautionary message present in Shelley's novel about trying to control to forces of nature in further depth than simply showing the misbegotten monsters alone.Visually, ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a treat. Turn-of-the-century London is portrayed in equal parts glittery and grimy, with period-appropriate costumes and hair adding to the effect. You can't have a ""Frankenstein"" movie without a few dead bodies, and this film is not shy about showing the various viscera, though it is all for a purpose and is far from excessive, with much less blood, gore, and grotesqueness than I was expecting. Much more is implied than actually shown in detail. As someone who avoids modern horror films for their indulgence, I applaud the filmmakers' restraint. The action scenes, which number precisely four and take up less than a quarter of the film's one-hour and forty-nine minute running time, are brief but intense, though rather tame when compared with your average action movie. They give Radcliffe a chance to utilize his gift for physicality, which he plays to the fullest. Yet for all its trappings as a horror film, the heart of ""Victor Frankenstein"" is the relationship between Victor and Igor. Both social misfits, they find themselves appreciated for who they are for the first time in their lives. It soon becomes very clear that Igor is the only real friend Victor has in the world, and that the latter, for all his grandiloquence, needs his lowlier creation more than Igor needs him. The chemistry between Radcliffe and McAvoy is there and is what makes the entire film tick. They both give equally strong performances individually, with McAvoy perfectly capturing the monomaniacal, socially awkward mad genius, a sharp complement to Radcliffe's soulful, loyal, levelheaded partner, but together they are a powerhouse, bringing delightful touches of humor and pathos to an otherwise rather serious film. More than once I felt myself growing teary-eyed. How many horror films can do that? As to the many negative reviews, I don't believe the critics and I watched the same movie. The pacing and focus was tight, the acting good, the film itself a rather straightforward drama with dashes of horror and action thrown in rather than a mixed bag, and the various subplots, rather than distracting from the main plot, came at the appropriate times, and helped to move it along. The only faults I found were the slight overuse of slow-motion in the action scenes, the rather quirky choice of superimposing anatomical drawings over various characters, and the script's occasionally on-the-nose dialogue (though Radcliffe and McAvoy's sincere performances made them less noticeable), but these are small qualms. Overall, there is much more to like than to dislike.My only explanation for all the hatred is that ""Frankenstein"" is a revered novel with a strong literary following; critics came in expecting a remake of the classic monster story, and after they were disappointed at what they saw as a desecration of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel, they took their vengeance out on this film, which never pretended to be an adaptation of that story in the first place. It goes without saying that if you're expecting a faithful facsimile of Shelley's novel or a 360-degree reinvention, you're in for a disappointment, because ""Victor Frankenstein"" is neither. But if you want to experience a well-acted, entertaining prequel to the classic story, you're in for a real treat.",Victor Frankenstein
116,scottlang-30253,A movie about the most civilised era,10,8 April 2020,"This movie is exceedingly British and I love that. I don't want to go into too much detail with this review, but there were so many great things about this movie to the extent I could write a lengthy book about the things I admired in this film.The accents were sublime and posh, the technology of the era was just about right without going too over the top and making people weird and anti-social and due to the lack of cars and relatively slow movement of people it makes me appreciate my lovely electric bike much more, when I'm doddering along at 15 mph on it I think back to those Victorians in this film who would've been delighted with such quick speeds, I fantasise about Victor accompanying me on his steampunk steam powered bike doing 15 mph and having a great laugh with him, my imaginary friend known as Victor Frankenstein wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for this film. All the characters seem so politically sane in this film which is a very refreshing breather from today's harsh, stupid political climate.Also the monster at the end of this film looks very tasty so this film always gives me a great appetite and gives me a longing for some delicious rats, balut, black pudding and mum's foot sweat every time I watch this amazing film. The scenery was truly beautiful and the scenes of London outside made me smell the sweet smell of steam power which made me nostalgic for the old steam ralleys I went to as a kid. You'll enjoy this film if you're British but I don't recommend it to Americans as Americans would probably get too jealous of Victorian London.",Victor Frankenstein

The first clue is five minutes of rambling narration. When the main character has to tell you what the film is about, you know the writer doesn't have any idea himself.The second clue is the cast of pre-cut characters, from an entire circus of irredeemable sadists, to Victor F. himself, twitching and fuming his way from one justification to the next.Cruel-to-be-kind, Frankenstein, fixes Igor's hump with a medicinal turkey baster, wielded like a slashers kitchen knife, gulping a mouthful of pus before humping Igor into a state of spinal alignment (via the Batman Begins School of full contact corrective surgery). This scene alone did more damage to the image of gays than a Westboro Church rally.And it never gets better. It just stumbles from one frenetic mess to the next, squandering the considerable acting talents and HUGE production budget on a monster more cobbled and dysfunctional than Dr. F's worst nightmare.Dross.",Victor Frankenstein

He should get an Oscar for it! I have never seen any actor be a mad scientist as realistic as he was! Also I loved how they showed the science behind and they created an animal before not just straight a human like in all other films.. Radcliff was good too, I think he really needed this ugly face character to finally made me forget him as Potter :) I hardly buy original DVDs because there are not a lot films nowadays that I would watch several times but this is one of them.

123,omar_hussin,"""Its alive!!""- Igor ""Cause that's rather obvious""- Victor Frankenstein",10,6 February 2016,"n London, ambitious medical student Victor Frankenstein (James McAvoy) attends a circus performance, where he saves an injured aerialist, Lorelei (Jessica Brown Findlay), aided by a nameless hunchback (Daniel Radcliffe) enslaved by the circus' ringleader, and who harbors feelings for the girl. Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and develops a harness to improve his posture, and then names him ""Igor"" after a recently deceased roommate. The two then become partners in Victor's ongoing experiments to create life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of religious police inspector Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott), who views their experiments as sinful.After Igor suggests they use electricity to animate their creations, Victor procures parts from dead animals and creates a monstrous chimpanzee-esque creature nicknamed ""Gordon"". Meanwhile, Igor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted homosexual baron, and the two develop an affair, upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration on their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victor's experiments and urges Igor to dissuade him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victor's domineering father, Mr. Frankenstein (Charles Dance), blames Victor.Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, and later approached by his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan (Freddie Fox), who wants him to create a humanoid artificial creature. Victor and Igor outline a behemoth being known as ""Prometheus"", but Igor's deepening relationship with Lorelei soon causes a rift between them. Shortly afterwards, Turpin and his men raid Victor's laboratory, hellbent on destroying his inventions, and during an altercation with Victor, Turpin loses both a hand and one of his eyes, while Victor and Igor are extracted by Finnegan's men and taken to his family's estate in Scotland, where Finnegan provides them with the necessary funds to build Prometheus. Igor is mistrustful of Finnegan and leaves after having a falling out with Victor. Finnegan later kidnapps and binds him, revealing his plans to kill Victor once Prometheus is complete and weaponize his creation. Igor is then thrown into the River Thames to drown, but manages to escape and reunites with Lorelei, who nurses him back to health.Once recovered, Igor returns to Finnegan's estate with Lorelei in tow in order to rescue Victor, and finds Victor on the verge of using lightning to animate Prometheus. He ignores Igor's pleas not to and activates the machine, just as Turpin unexpectedly arrives, the failed, illegal raid on Victor's laboratory having cost his career, and opens fire on the machinery. Despite his intervention, Prometheus springs to life and rampages through the complex, killing Finnegan and Turpin. Victor realizes his efforts were misguided and joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts. Igor sustains severe injures in the fight and collapses in Victor's arms.Igor soon recovers, having once again been nursed back to health by Lorelei. He then finds a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused and recognizes Igor was his ""greatest creation"". Igor then reunites with Lorelei, while Victor retreats to the Scottish countryside in search of new discoveries.If you like science movies and frankenstein, you will like this movie.For me its a 10/10 !! :)))",Victor Frankenstein

125,avdropm-944-921852,Good riff on a traditional story,7,11 December 2015,"The story of Frankenstein has been told and retold repeatedly since Shelley's novel, and previous movie treatments have aimed variously for Gothic horror, action adventure, character study and psychological drama.In this case, the plot of the movie is a riff on the 1931 Boris Karloff version and direct derivatives (assembling a human body from parts and animating them with lightning, police nemesis, hunchbacked assistant, remote castle), with a change of focus from the tragedy of the monster (also a primary theme of the novel), or even from the monster entirely, to an attempt at answering a central question about Dr. Frankenstein himself: ""What was he thinking?"" We are given the perspective of the assistant, designated as ""Igor"", with enough backstory to make him sympathetic and his choices comprehensible, and through him we are introduced to medical student Frankenstein, well-rendered as an otherwise decent person who is believably and dangerously manic and obsessive (rather than theatrically insane or cold-blooded and sociopathic). We follow Igor as he is drawn first by gratitude and loyalty, then friendship and compassion, to assist in a project that at first sounds dubious and gradually turns disastrous and horrible.The movie will not be satisfying to an audience hoping for extended combat scenes featuring the monster, brooding character studies in dark motivations, or wide, cinematic views of lonely Gothic settings (most of it takes place in a repurposed urban warehouse), although it as brief and well-chosen examples of all of those things. Frankenstein himself lacks the usual wife/fiancé, and the only romantic angle is an association of Igor's that serves to frame the plot.The story the movie actually chooses to tell is engaging and well done.",Victor Frankenstein

How the very idea of having the hunchback actually being a pus-filled tumor which they disgustingly drain ever made it to screen makes me wonder how many souls were sold to the devil. Radcliffe is ridiculous as an abused clown in a traveling circus. I can't imagine pitching this movie: ""Igor will be an abused clown in a traveling circus. And his hunchback is really just a pus-filled tumor...."" ""Hey great idea! Let's throw millions of dollars at it. But maybe Igor the Creepy Clown won't bring people in. Let's deceive them and call it Victor Frankenstein--a dynamic interesting man. Bait and switch--yeah, that will work!""

Its a great, freaky tale of mankind going crazy and this is my favourite version of it - I believe that I've seen them all.

While it is not a horror (as the trailer leads you to believe) it is a thrilling sci fi period tale. The story is interesting, very character driven. The acting is top notch. Daniel Radcliffe certainly delivers in this, especially as a hunchback. Bullied and enslaved by a malicious circus, he is cast as a freak attraction but harbors a passionate interest and outstanding talent for medical science. In his role as a young outcast caught between his morals and his ambition to create notable scientific progress, he is intriguing and very sympathetic. James mcavoy is the famous mad scientist and does an excellent job of showing the unstable side as he slides into madness, spurred on by his ambition to create life from death. His performance is outstanding and really captures the audience. Andrew Scott portrays Turpin, a police inspector who becomes obsessed with catching Igor and victor, and is a religious zealot. Quite like Javert from Les miserables. The costumes are exquisite, as well as the hair and make up (Daniels long hair is amazing.) the cinematography is great, everything is brilliant. Only problem I have with it is the script. Some of the writing falls flat in some places but all in all, a brilliantly done film. Very electrifying, if you'll pardon the pun.",Victor Frankenstein

James McAvoy is an amazing actor, somehow I believe everything he does - weather it's a mad genius Victor Frankenstein, brilliant professor in X-men or just an ordinary man in love with his wife in The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. The scenes in the circus at the beginning of the movie are brilliantly done; slow motion of running and circus performers, along with the fire and light effects are my favorite one.

In the past I was underwhelmed by the lack of character motivation, poorly constructed story line, and general misinterpretations. Previous films actually bored me with the whole concept but this film brought life back to it. It had action,romance,dialogue,character development, and a solid artistic interpretation which i had found lacking in the past films. It allows you to understand the characters and though there are played by familiar faces, Daniel Radcliffe, James McAvoy, Jessica Findlay(Downtown Abbey) and Andrew Scott(James Bond),it is well casted and provides multiple interesting perspectives of the madness that ensues in effort to create life. I highly suggest you give the film a chance I was reluctant at first but was happily surprised by the result. Of any reason to at least give it a try, it is very different from other adaptations, it is well acted by the entire cast,and has some beautifully eerie scenery that well sets the mood of the film.",Victor Frankenstein
136,sanctuary_thirteen,Homage to the Same Love,5,27 November 2015,"Frankenstein is often represented as a warning against man playing god. It is perhaps instead a warning against man creating without woman. Without the maternal element, the novel's Victor abandons his horrific creation, thus setting in motion the chain of events which make a monster monstrous. But forget all that. This movie has apparently solved it. Rather than explore the underpinnings of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelleys novel (the daughter of one of the greatest feminists of all time) this film plays more on the cinematic allure of the story, and replaces the lacking maternal sense with an overtly homosexual relationship between Igor and Victor. And has a pretty fun time with it. So Spoilers... We see Igor released from his circus torment and elevated to Victor's assistant. First thing he does is suit up, attack Igor physically FROM BEHIND, and assail him. He penetrates him with the syringe and withdraws a white fluid from him via a tube using his mouth, which he then casually spits out before further asserting his dominance over Igor with more leather posture gear and a demand to cleanse himself. Wow. The subsequent time is spent in an exploration of this relationship. Time Igor spends with his circus acrobat crush is derided by Victor as a waste. Victors father strikes his son and insults his ""Experimenting at college."" They drunkenly design their ideal man (RHPS style) and discuss the need for ""Large Organs."" Igor is exposed to the finances and accounts are shared. Very domestic. Finally Victor pronounces them ""Partners"" and the relationship sours shortly thereafter. Another suitor appears, who similarly whispers in Victors ear from behind in a way not dissimilar to Victor behind Igor nearer the beginning, this time with promises of funding and acclaim. Throughout this, a fanatical inspector (ironically played perfectly by a homosexual actor) sees their lifestyle as sinful and informed by Satan, and sees a conspiracy in every last connection. He assails them at every opportunity, breaking their door down, deforming himself in the process of his personal crusade. His cries of conspiracy and immoral lasciviousness fall on deaf ears and he is forcibly retired. Igor is apparently disposed of, resulting in his ""rebirth"" from near drowning. Temporarily ""cured"" of his attraction to Victor, he returns to his acrobatic love but quickly realizes where his loyalties lie, and she assists him in reuniting with Victor. It's barely even hidden. I was rather disappointed when the electrical bolts around Prometheus didn't form a triangle, the imagery was THAT overt. As a Frankenstein film, it does a couple of things uniquely, but the really enjoyable parts were simply the abusive yet loving relationship between these two. Also, the word ""suck"" was used repeatedly. Just saying.",Victor Frankenstein

However, the storyline itself is really weird. And it seems like it was slapped together at last call at the bar, because not much thought went into it so it appears. The first 20 minutes prove exciting, but then it goes downhill after that.

I was pleasantly surprised by an interesting, intense, and very believable film. The cinematography was dark, sort of like the Moulin Rouge movie. It was just really good from start to finish. Clean acting and engrossing story. The scenes where they are bringing dead things back to life can be very graphic and disturbing at times. I thought this would have been a better release around Halloween with an R rating. But overall awesome movie. I liked it better than Bond, Mocking jay (both good), and the Good Dinosaur (not that good).

And sadly, the story line had its flaws.

Yes, Victor a bit insane for creating him in the first place.But I honestly didn't prepare of how it was going to be from Igor's point of view.

He's there to help, to do what he's told.Daniel Radcliffe's Igor gives a new perspective to me. He is a person with quite background story. I like this Igor.

I also like how Igor see Victor and in turn, we finally know the real Victor and his obsession.Daniel and James McAvoy surely didn't disappoint – I think they both are never.

For some reason I liked the story been told from his point of view. Another interesting bit is when you are from a place like Ghana in West Africa, you don't grow up knowing much about America myths (because of course you have your own country specific myths to worry about) so a story like Frankenstein's was known to me wayyyyy older in my life, and frankly all I can remember about it is the Monster not the Man.

144,raffaelregis,"Good acting, poor script, no soul",4,18 April 2018,"I'll start this review by praising the film: it is, aesthetically, an awesome movie. All the elements are in the right place, the gothic victorian circuses, hospitals, city, universities, the production design for this film is astonishingly detailed, as is the makeup, costume design and the locations they chose. The acting is excellent at some extent, let's say, from the beginning to the middle of the film. I wouldn't blame the actors though, even with Daniel Radcliffe going a little bit Potteresque - as in an useless protagonist - from the middle onwards. But i believe that's more a fault of the script and maybe the director, than the actor. Editing, music, mixing, photography, special effects, all ok. Direction: could be better. The experience is a lot worse when you've seen Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994), and start comparing the two movies. Instead of taking in and widening the more humanistic, polemical view on morality, or on an illuminated argument of science versus faith, which the script actually points to be going to when the inspector - in the only acting highlight on the whole film - challenges the mad scientist who at this point is not so mad, this fine line turns into dust we see it wreck into common drama (the tragic loss of someone dear) and some quite corny action (?) scenes. As most people, I really didn't like the ending. It's very segregated, too quick and lacks argument and acting. It has just one scene that could be better played and a lot of production show off. One other way to bring it would be to go deeper on Dr. Frankestein's madness. The title character only shows conflict barely, never taking a reflection on what could easily build a good monologue. James McAvoy is such a talented artist, it would be nice to watch him develop on this character, to give it a more ""you would do it if you were in my place"" kind of moment, to let the viewers savor their inner mad scientists a little. The love romance is absolutely dispensable. The female character is very much reduced to absolutely nothing, to irrelevance, wasting such a good actress. Wouldn't be missed if it was edited out. The female presence could be better used, it is a shame it wasn't. As is the family drama, which spawned just one, completely frivolous, little scene. Could be better used, maybe not concurring with the main argument as it actually is (sanity, morality). It could be a better movie if the writer took the opportunity to write a better script (or if the executive producers didn't meddle, I really don't know what happened). I'm sure the actors could play whatever twist nicely. But here the director had also an opportunity to right some wrongs, and I'm sure he did a little. But it feels like at some point he got tired of going against the stream and just let the script show itself. As the credits rolled up, I couldn't help thinking that a budget of 40 million dollars could be better used to pay the debts of some really poor countries. Instead of that we have a not so awesome movie with no soul whatsoever that will entertain very few people.",Victor Frankenstein
145,btsmall74,You know this story,6,28 April 2016,"I believe the low critic ratings for this film are unjustified. Certainly the complaints that it deviates too much from or warps Mary Shelley's novel are unwarranted. It obviously draws more from monster features of the 1950s than it does from the novel (the character of Igor was, I believe created for film and was not one of Shelley's characters anyway). It is difficult to come up with something passing for original from a story that has been rehashed endlessly for decades, but this, at least, comes quite close.McAvoy and Radcliffe have great chemistry and are obviously having a lot of fun. Daniel Radcliffe is no Laurence Olivier, let's face it, but I will say, with brotherly fondness, that his skill as an actor is improving. At least he can bring on much more convincing teary-eyed emotion now than he did back in The Order of the Phoenix (cringe). He is also developing a knack for comic timing. McAvoy manages to portray Frankenstein with an excellent balance of intellectual arrogance and manic obsessiveness, yet still makes him oddly charming and likable.I'm pleased to see a Gothic-style film that I don't have to squint at in order to watch - it is shot with plenty of light while still conveying the grittiness and dirt of that dark Victorian-era London film-goers are used to. The colour palette is muted but appropriate in sepia tones, and again conveys Gothic style nicely without being drab in its bleakness.Overall - highly recommended. Not challenging and, as is stated twice in the film itself, ""you know this story"". But certainly entertaining.",Victor Frankenstein
146,placebia,Enjoyable,6,9 December 2015,"Just came back from watching Victor Frankenstein. It was  enjoyable. Someone who studies medicine would probably be annoyed (some of the main characters' knowledge about anatomy may not be correct), but there were some funny/dramatic scenes. Also, if you try to find parallels between the movie and the Harry Potter movies, it becomes even more fun (they even have a pseudo Draco Malfoy!).Anyway, it's nice to see Harry Potter and young Charles Xavier try to make a zombie while BBC's Moriarty tries to stop them and Tywin Lannister appears just to express his disappointment. McAvoy and Radcliffe have great chemistry, which I did not expect, so that a pleasant surprise!I found the fight with the monster too fast-paced though. I could hardly realize what was happening when it was over. Also, I did not like how at the end, Victor Frankenstein does not appear to have learned his lesson and plans to make another creature ""one day"".Perhaps they are hinting at a sequel that way?",Victor Frankenstein
147,amason5995,0/10,1,1 February 2021,"We chose this for our bad movie night and it was perfectly ridiculous. The creativity is elementary at best, the acting is laughable, and script is nothing but tropes and clichés. The science was non-existent. I don't understand how this has 6/10.",Victor Frankenstein
148,rileyreviews,Draggy,4,2 December 2015,"Over-hyped. I understand the title is ""Victor Frankenstein"", it's about his story, it's about him. Halfway through the movie (or even the first quarter), I was bored already. The cinema crowd was great. No one was being noisy, no one was on their phone (this usually irritates me). It was the perfect crowd and the movie still did not entertain me.Perhaps my expectations were sky high which lead to disappointment. I wish the main character's development was better because I felt that it lacked foundation. Not to mention the one too many extras that made the movie a mess. You don't even know where to set your focus on.",Victor Frankenstein
149,amandals-67925,"Very enjoyable and entertaining, perfect casting",9,27 August 2018,"People can say whatever they want about Dan Radcliffe but this guy was born to perform. I can never get enough of his talent. His corporal expression is extraordinary in my opinion, and he shows it beautifully in this movie. James McCoy is a beast! I have now watched almost his entire filmography. You can see how much energy and commitment he puts into his characters. His performances overwhelm me, he is just great. And Jessica Brown Findlay is a doll, delicate and also very expressive. They all together have amazing chemistry in this movie. The scenes are nicely shot, the photography is amazing, music is good. And surprisingly I liked the way the story was told even though very different from what everybody knows about Frankenstein. If you're looking for entertainment, I highly recommend this one!",Victor Frankenstein
150,kirkbonnett,So much potential,10,22 March 2020,"I am giving a 10 because I think many of the other reviews are unfair. It had many elements of a great movie but, like a lot of other movies these days, were so interesting in setting up the sequel, destroyed the end and in doing so, failed at a great opportunity to tie everything together.",Victor Frankenstein
151,nicolekitkit,Not worth the time,4,6 December 2015,"I went to see the film because I am a fan of James McAvoy, but sadly the movie did not justice to the amazing performance of James and Daniel Radcliffe. The editing and script was so bad. Each scenes are very disconnected and scattered. It also feels very jumpy and certain places were not explained well. I especially hate how they use the title opening ""Victor Frankenstein"" as if it is a verbal line in the movie.. It was SO ODD!The lines were also very cheesy and clumsy, which you just wouldn't speak to each other like this in real life. It was only of James' amazing acting skill that makes the movie barely watchable!",Victor Frankenstein
152,rfriendga,This movie is another example of poor pre-show advertisement.,8,10 July 2016,"I judge the location of where I will be watching a movie by the trailers and pre-show interviews. Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy are both fantastic actors and well worth the price of admission to any big-screen, HD, IMax experience. For being that person on a budget I have to make the decision about the big screen expense, smaller screen expense, rental, or library check out. I waited on the library for this movie and I feel I was cheated out of a great big screen experience. The characters were so full of life and the imagery well worth the large screen.I enjoyed this movie the for story and the acting. It was would have been well worth the expense.",Victor Frankenstein
153,rafael-eisenhut,Ich liked it,7,9 March 2019,Good movie. I liked the acting and the Story was good too. but a Bad pacing...,Victor Frankenstein
154,ivanlotter,Monstrous failure,4,15 July 2018,I do not see how even a horror/thriller fanatic will enjoy this movie. I would give it a miss.,Victor Frankenstein
155,tegantemari,excellent,10,24 November 2015,"this this masterful piece of cinema is just just just so gay. so gay... I'm not even saying this as a joke they even shoehorned a gay character in just to tell everyone that yes homosexuality is accepted in this movie i give this a full stars due to how many times it made me feel sick to my stomach but still i cannot fathom to get past just the gazes full of meaning. they weren't just talking they were connecting. i have never in my life seen two men communicate in such a way as they werewith that aside the cgi in this is massive, but you can still tell it was completely fabricated. however the makeup and costumes were very well done, and the acting was astonishing.",Victor Frankenstein
156,aleiskander,Beyond Expectation,10,6 March 2016,"The first half of the movie was spectacular, beyond any expectation I had before watching the movie.Breathtaking,amazing and geeky.In the full film I admired the excellent performance of Daniel,Jason and Andrew.(Jason really deserved an Oscar) Although,when those 3 finally meet during the middle of the movie,and I was about to explode from joy to see 3 masterminds competing, the movie suddenly changed to an average semi-romance,thriller drama of a low talented scriptwriter. I was really disappointed when the slowly progressing,detailed play suddenly turned to this ""Lets just speed up things and make them simple"" Although I still give a straight 10 to the movie,even if it is only for the first half.",Victor Frankenstein
157,vancehend,A brilliantly unique and refreshing approach to the classic story we thought we knew.,9,25 February 2016,"""Victor Frankenstein"" reveals a masterfully created body of work and one of gargantuan proportions. Together, Director Paul McGuigan and Writer Max Landis bring forth new vision for an old tale that had not seen such creativity since it's much earlier incarnations. ""Victor Frankenstein"" is a sensational film deserving the highest praises from not only long-time friends of the genre but by those new to the story as well. Life, love, hope and sadness; Bravery, boldness, joy and pain all sown together in an epic tale for the ages.Simply the finest dramatic interpretation of this ageless classic in our lifetime.",Victor Frankenstein
158,keriandharold,Open-minded and loved it,9,12 May 2016,"There are no spoilers here, just a real person's true review. I almost did not watch this due to the overall reviews, and that would have been a shame, because I liked it. To all the naysayers looking for a solid track to the original story, this is a bit different. This a a completely different take. Parts of the movie were not so great, but overall, I LOVED IT.Depends on what you're looking for. If you are looking for a story perfectly true to original - not so much. This movie is a wonderful alternative view. I appreciate and really enjoyed the risk-taking and the different view. May not be for everyone, but thoroughly enjoyed it.",Victor Frankenstein
159,loschuler,Good movie,8,20 November 2019,A fun movie more about the story behind the story we all know. I watch for entertainment and I was entertained.,Victor Frankenstein
160,hallows-21557,What is this shoot?,2,11 April 2017,"As a famous uncle Bob's record review begun in the late sixties : ""What is this s**t?"" Since that famous Rolling Stone review this 'incipit' goes to underline something which is really too disappointing to be analyzed fairly. Except for the good artcraft, the beloved actors and the theme which can bear even worse massacrees, all this project is so bad I could not refrain from posting my disapproval. One nonsense for all others: what is the impossible revenant (she falls to certain death from a six floors height in the beginning of the movie) Lorelei lass doing in the last fight scene? How did she get there, when? This flick violates the narrative pact so badly it becomes preposterous to even confess one watched it all. Shame on you Avoys & Radcliffey, for crying out loud!",Victor Frankenstein
161,jjjones-27571,Possibly one of the best films I have watched in the last 15-20 years,9,1 August 2018,"Possibly one of the best films I have watched in the last 15-20 years.
Beautifully filmed this is a master class on how to film and direct a movie.The film constantly draws and entertains your eye with thoughtful positioning and movement of the camera. The attention to detail of the sets throughout was impressive. The script was spot on with just the right amount of humour which kept pace with the action.The acting from James McAvoy was first rate. Supported by Daniel Radcliffe who raised his game from his harry potter roles for this movie. A great performance from Andrew Scott as the over zealous inspector. All the cast played their parts well.Need to watch it at least twice to really appreciate the amount of work that must have gone into putting this together.Well done all",Victor Frankenstein
