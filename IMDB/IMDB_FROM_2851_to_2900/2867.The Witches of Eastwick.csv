0,MartinHafer,I just thought this film was really dumb....and I know many loved this film.,3,18 February 2021,"As I sat and watched ""The Witched of Eastwick"", I felt a very strong disconnect between my reaction to the movie and most of the other reviews I read on this site. A lot of people liked it...a lot. As for me, I liked parts of it (particularly the acting of Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer and Cher), but so much of it I absolutely hated. I hated all the vomiting (and WOW was there a lot of vomiting), the over-acting of Jack Nicholson (an actor I usually love) and the script...ouch, the script!!The film is about three women in the New England town of Eastwick. A strange, devilish man, Daryl (Nicholson) arrives and buys a huge mansion. He then proceeds to seduce the three women and somehow imbue them with magical powers. In the process, there is the vomiting, the overacting and a film LESS subtle than a stripper showing up at a Baptist barbecue and proceeding to do her act! The film is just loud, abrasive and rather painful to watch. And, with such an expensive and high profile cast, coming up with a film this annoying is hard to imagine. There are some good elements to the movie, but they just get lost among the chaos...yes, chaos that is the film. The director certainly had a major part in all this. Had the film been funny and shown SOME restraint, it sure would have worked much better for me.",The Witches of Eastwick
1,Leofwine_draca,One of a kind,6,15 December 2020,"An interesting, very '80s supernatural comedy from MAD MAX director George Miller, a bit too outlandish and far-fetched even for my tastes, but one that works thanks to the talents of the cast involved. The three actresses are the stars and humanise the story, but the stand-out turn is from an extremely hammy Jack Nicholson, delivering an incredibly physical performance that even surpasses his mad turns in the likes of THE SHINING. Miller loves him, and so do we, the viewer. The humour is quirky and weird throughout, sometimes too bad taste for its own good (pity poor Veronica Cartwright), but the last half an hour is tremendous cartoon-like fun that benefits from great stunts, FX, mad acting and the presence of special effects man Rob Bottin.",The Witches of Eastwick
2,SnoopyStyle,not much fun to watch,5,25 January 2016,"Alex Medford (Cher) is a sculptor and a single mom. Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) is a cellist, music teacher, divorced and barren. Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a local columnist and alone with six daughters. The three single friends lament the lack of quality men and share their dream man wishes. Then the mysterious wild Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) arrives with his manservant Fidel buying the Lennox Mansion which is suppose to be the site of witch burnings. He seduces the three women unleashing their inner power. Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright) is the religious wife of newspaper editor Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins) who is Sukie's boss.Firstly, Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast for this role. The problem is that I hate this character. I find him annoying and really off-putting. He's not fun to watch. There is something more than simply evil that is grating on my nerves. It makes the movie hard to watch although the story is interesting. I just don't find it fun.",The Witches of Eastwick
3,claudio_carvalho,Strange Combination of Horror and Comedy,7,28 November 2015,"In the traditional and conservative Eastwick, the sculptress Alexandra Medford (Cher), the shy musician and teacher Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and the journalist Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are best friends. Alexandra is a widow; Jane is divorced since she can not have a child; and Sukie is divorced because she frequently gets pregnant and has five children. They are sexually repressed and one night, they describe the characteristics of their ideal man while drinking. There is a storm on the town and the mysterious Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) appears in town and buy a notorious mansion. NJobody can recall his name, but he seduces the three friends. Meanwhile the pious Felicia Alden (Veronica Cartwright), who is married with Sukie's boss Clyde Alden (Richard Jenkins), has a weird accident and feels that Daryl is the devil. When Felicia dies, Alexandra, Jane and Sukie realize that there is something strange about Daryl. But what can they do? ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is a sexy and original film with a strange combination of horror and comedy. Jack Nicholson is comfortable performing another totally incorrect character. The sinful witches are represented by three gorgeous actresses. The special effects are great and responsible for funny scenes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""As Bruxas de Eastwick"" (""The Witches of Eastwick"")",The Witches of Eastwick
4,gavin6942,Jack Nicholson or Bill Murray,7,28 October 2015,"Three single women in a picturesque village have their wishes granted - at a cost - when a mysterious and flamboyant man (Jack Nicholson) arrives in their lives.So, the role Jack Nicholson plays originally was intended for Bill Murray? That is a mind-blower. Nicholson is creepy, dirty, lewd... he always has that edge of crazy. Dangerous crazy. Murray can be crazy, but silly crazy... I cannot see him being the dirty old man so much as the funny overseer. It would be a completely different tone.Great film, though... definitely worth seeing, and a great demonstration of Cher as an actress. She seemed to only have a few years to a decade of being in big movies, but she did those well.",The Witches of Eastwick
5,lee_eisenberg,Which witch is which?,8,6 June 2006,"In a role that only Jack Nicholson could play, he comes to the rescue of three lonely women (Susan Sarandon, Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer) in a New England...but who is he really? There are some scenes here that are really likely to blow your mind, not the least of which are the cherry scene or the whole speech about why societies executed women - much of which involves inappropriate conversation. They know how to make everything cool here. Also starring Veronica Cartwright, Richard Jenkins (aka Nate Sr. on ""Six Feet Under"") and Carl Struycken (aka Lurch in the ""Addams Family"" movies).All in all, something REALLY neat this way comes!",The Witches of Eastwick
6,jboothmillard,The Witches of Eastwick,7,22 September 2005,"From director George Miller (Mad Max, Babe: Pig in the City), watching this film again was a good idea, I do remember giggling and liking the stars, but I certainly needed a better idea of the story. Basically, in the town of Eastwick, New England, friends Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer) are bored, and conjure up a mystery man to satisfy their desires, as they have no husbands anymore. So along comes the man who fits the bill perfectly, filthy rich Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson), and one by one, he gives them a night of passion, and they find powers within themselves. They realise that Daryl is too much for them all to take, and after one final night of passion for the three of them, the women make a voodoo doll of Daryl to use and ruin the life of, to try and make him go away. This spell only enrages Daryl, who they realise is the Devil on Earth, but they do manage to destroy him, and they are all left with babies from him, and he can only communicate via television. Also starring Alien's Veronica Cartwright as Felicia Alden and Richard Jenkins as Clyde Alden. Nicholson, along with the three female leads, make good performances, the bewitching special effects are quite good, and there are some amusing moments, I think for me it is the charming sensual fantasy that makes this watchable. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Very good!",The Witches of Eastwick
7,ccthemovieman-1,Very Entertaining But Very Blasphemous,6,16 September 2006,"Well, here is the ""horny little devil"" getting his due. He (""Darryl Van Horne""played expertly by Jack Nicholson) gets in his philosophies and beliefs for much of the film. He gives us mostly feminist (overly so) Left Wing rants and does so in crude manner but the women don's seem to mind because they are crude themselves.One look at the cast (Nicholson, Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeffer and Veronica Cartwright) tells you this script was not written by members of the DAR! These are all very liberal people with liberal viewpoints. Sex jokes abound throughout ans the women casually talk about the size of men's penises, etc Although Nicholson - The Devil - gets it in the end with some voodoo nonsense, he still comes out looking like a pretty cool guy. That's no surprise, coming from Hollywood. The only person in this story who knows from the start that he's the Devil (the others are clueless most of the time) is the Christian woman (Cartwright) but of course she's pictured as some wide-eyed lunatic.The actors are fun to watch, it's an interesting story but for any Believer, this movie is blasphemous, big-time. For the secular crowd, which means most people, this is a fun movie.",The Witches of Eastwick
8,rmax304823,"Morality tale with, very funny scenes.",8,8 March 2004,"Some of the points in the movie are left unexplained. It seems a little discontinuous. Assuming these three gals are witches, haven't they ever noticed it before? Why are they attracted to the repulsive Nicholson? How did they acquire the power to suspend themselves in midair? A couple of things like that, but they're not too important.We know the story is looking into peoples' relationship with God, not just because the movie shows us this but because we know that John Updike, who wrote the novel, has been absorbed by spiritual issues throughout his career. In case we don't know about the novel, many of the most important scenes take place in the local church, which cue us in.Not that the church scenes, or any other scenes, are particularly solemn or preachy. We're distanced from everything that's going on because it's so clearly a fantasy and sometimes an outrageously funny one. The cast could hardly be improved upon. In most of his scenes Nicholson is into his self-consciously ironic mode -- that fake smile seems to sit on his face whenever he's not speaking. But in two key scenes, when Cher confronts him while he's ironing and at the climax, he puts effort into his performance and it clicks. The three babes are great and complement each other perfectly. There is an overhead shot towards the end when the three of them are running barefoot at dainty full speed across the marble floor of the mansion, their loose silk robes billowing behind them, their fluffy curly mops of hair bobbing (one black, one amber, one blond), that seems to turn them into three mice or gerbils or fairies. A delightful shot. The director is fond of overhead shots. (God is a major player in this movie.) They're used well. Veronica Cartwright must be mentioned too, since she gives the closest thing to a serious dramatic performance in the film. She's driven mad by the devil and, what with her clogged nose and croaking voice, evokes pity in us. She's the only person in town who sees exactly what's going on, and she dies for it. Her husband has a difficult role but handles it well, a necessary balance between his rage at his wife's insane behavior and the need to smile and chuckle and treat these preposterous troubles as nothing more than a slight perturbation in their normal orbits. He blows his stack at the end. Also his wife's stack.Some scenes linger in the mind more than others. The harmonious foursome frolicking in a sea of balloons while ""nesun dorma"" plays from a boom box. (Some of the sound, including this aria, is irritatingly tinny.) The song in its operatic context combines heartbreak with ecstasy. (It's used to the former effect in ""The Killing Grounds"" and for the latter here.) The scene in which Nicholson coaches Sarandon on the cello then leaps to the piano and bangs out the accompaniment is thrilling. No wonder the cello smokes! The climax at the mansion is an extravaganza of special effects, but it's not the most funny or meaningful scene in the film. That takes place a bit earlier, when the three witches blow Nicholson's devil into the church, then practice more voodoo on him. First he vomits a couple of gallons of cherry pits in some glucous fluid onto the clothes and upturned faces of the congregation, dismissing the event with a casual, ""Pay no attention. A cheap trick. Anyone can do it. I TAUGHT it to them. Just a little domestic problem."" In this sea of people staring at him and moaning with disgust, he's staggering around in a filthy robe covered with ice cream and feathers while he launches into HIS idea of a Sunday sermon. ""Did God make women deliberately or was it a mistake? Huh? Whaddaya think? You think God doesn't MAKE mistakes? Sure, when we make a mistake we call it 'evil' but when HE makes a mistake (he strikes a bizarre port de bras with arms pointing towards heaven) we call it 'NATURE'."" He and Updike have a point. If God never makes mistakes, then how come my nerves are all ajangle, and why did He run my urethra through the middle of my prostate, and whatever moved Him to create my ex wife? Then Nicholson gets into a riff on how women are a deliberate curse and the sooner we realize it the better because then we can do something about it. (He's really warming up to the sermon at this point.) We can find a cure -- or invent a vaccine. ""Build up our IMMUNE system or sump'n. Get a little exercise! Twenty push ups a day and they disappear!""It's not all that funny, and it's not a horror flick by any means. Evil is seductive, but ultimately destructive. It can be overcome by human rectitude. it's an engaging film, a good job by everyone involved (except the sound man), including John Williams who did a sprightly loopy main theme. Devilishly clever.",The Witches of Eastwick
9,Tweekums,Three lonely women summon a devilish stranger,8,28 February 2019,"Alexandra, Jane and Sukie are three friends living in the New England town of Eastwick. They have all been married but are now single, somewhat frustrated and wanting a man in their lives. They talk together about the sort of man they would like... the next day the mysterious Daryl Van Horne arrives in Eastwick and quickly shows an interest in the trio. Soon they are spending much of their time at his house and the town gossips are talking. Events start to make them wonder just who Van Horne is and how dangerous he might be.This film is a lot of fun. The setting is almost a cliché of the perfect New England town with the sort of people one expects in the Hollywood vision of such towns; the introduction of the devilish Van Horne was a delight. Jack Nicholson is great in the role; I can't really think of anybody else who could be as good in the part; simultaneously seductive, wicked with more than a hint of danger. Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer nicely contrast as Alexandra, Jane and Sukie; a brunette, redhead and a blonde; they do a fine job depicting the women's changes under Daryl's influence. Veronica Cartwright is also very impressive Felicia Alden; the woman who first realises something is wrong in town. There are plenty of memorable moments; most notably a scene involving a bowl of cherries and projectile vomiting! The special effects were decent for the time but some are starting to show their age now; not enough to spoil my enjoyment though. Overall I'd definitely recommend this.",The Witches of Eastwick
10,BA_Harrison,What next? A feminist Mad Max movie?,5,2 November 2021,"Two divorcees and a widow (Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Cher), who unknowingly have witchy powers, wish for a specific type of man to enter their small-town lives and shake things up: he must be charming, intelligent, not too good looking, and have a medium sized dick. They get Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson), a balding older man with a gut, a nasty ponytail, and bad fashion sense, who still manages to charm his way between the legs of all three by telling them exactly what they want to hear: that they are strong, talented and confident women. In reality, Van Horne is the devil, on a mission to corrupt, manipulate, and impregnate. When the women realise that Daryl is a wrong 'un, they cut him out of their lives, which makes him angry and vengeful. The three women decide enough is enough, acquire an in-depth understanding of magick from a handy guidebook, and give Van Horne a taste of his own medicine.George Miller is one of my favourite directors, if only for his Mad Max series and Babe: Pig In The City, but this movie, based on a novel by John Updike, never held much appeal for me. It's a muddled effort that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: feminist fantasy, chick flick, horror, or comedy. It veers clumsily from one to the other, falling at almost every hurdle. It's not funny, it's not scary, and if women can only come to believe that they are strong and powerful after being told so by a man, then it kinda fails at feminism as well (without Daryl, they'd have never realised their true potential). Also, the only character who actually recognises that evil is at work in the town is painted as a raving loony and gets brained with a poker by her husband? What are we supposed to read into that?Oh, and laughing whilst falling from a great height makes you float, apparently. Who knew?From a technical standpoint, the film is more than competent, with decent special effects and some impressive camerawork, as one might expect from Miller, but this is far from his best work.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",The Witches of Eastwick
11,moonspinner55,"Despite frantic happiness and high spirits, a pall hangs over this adaptation of Updike like a dark cloud",6,26 November 2002,"Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer play single gals in New England (with untapped psychic abilities) who fall in lust with the new man in town: a fat, balding, horny character with a high charisma-rate and a smile of temptation. The picture has a sassy opening and some ribald humor but is incredibly uneven, both a fantasy and a frolic while at the same time attempting something deeper (and embellished with special effects that make it seem weighty and lumbering). Jack Nicholson's rampant dementia is good for a few laughs early on, and the ladies are lovely, although Pfeiffer's character appears to get lost in the editing. Slick but shallow, with a noisy third act--complete with a second vomiting scene--that collapses like a house of cards. **1/2 from ****",The Witches of Eastwick
12,Quinoa1984,"The songs Witchy Woman (women) meets Sympathy for the Devil, combined for a comic fantasy",9,14 May 2003,"George Miller (Mad Max) creatively sets the stage for a story of three witches and one Lucifer, who are in regular human form, in a small, uptight New England town. Of course, for a tale like this one can try to suspend disbelief, and it has to be when dealing with the supernatural. Thankfully, Miller has great casting tastes- Cher, Sarandon, and Pfieffer are wonderful in their roles, each with an acute, potent sexuality that was at their peaks in the late 80's. And then there's Mr shark grin himself, Jack Nicholson, who gives another superb layer to the performance of the dark prince. There are other actors who have portrayed the man downstairs- Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate was the devil as lawyer, Billy Crystal was himself in the Woody/Dante sequence in Deconstructing Harry, even Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled. But rarely have they had this much outright fun and charm with the role, enough to almost make me, a man in his 20s, charmed too. Maybe it's the eyebrows. Nicholson gives one of his best over-the-top performances as the ""horny-little devil"" Darryl, who comes into town during a storm and cooks up more than that for his avid female guests. Of course, he doesn't have control for long, when the girls find they have powers of their own. When the movie gets overly fantastic (which is a number of times) it gets a little hard to take, yet the acting is above par, and the special effects are a delight.",The Witches of Eastwick
13,Coventry,Bewitching performances,7,21 November 2010,"I've been re-watching a lot of childhood favorites lately and, to my deepest regret, quite a lot of them aren't nearly as good as I remembered them. ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is half an exception. It's not the genuine black comedy masterpiece that I worshiped when I was twelve years old, but it's nevertheless still a very amusing 80's fantasy with outrageous performances (Jack Nicholson truly excels!) and a handful of unforgettable gross-out moments. The film wondrously opens with atmospheric images of a sleepy and stereotypical small New England town called Eastwick. Alex, Sukie and Jane are three close friends who have all ""lost"" their husband one way or another and meet up every Thursday to drink, forget about their loneliness problems and fantasize about better lives. They don't realize, however, that the three of them can make things happen if they wish for something simultaneously. That's how they unwarily conjure their ideal man, the not-so-attractive but charming, eloquent and overly sexually active Daryl Van Horne. All together they develop a vivid quadrilateral relationship, which causes a tremendous scandal in the conservative town. The women also slowly begin to realize that Daryl is a devilish individual if he doesn't get what he wants. The Australian born George Miller directs with a surefooted attitude and a great feeling for comic relief, especially during the first hour and a half. During the last half hour, the emphasis lies more on horror and special effects. Although I usually like horror and fantasy, the climax of ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is a little too boisterous and chaotic, especially in comparison to the moody and ironic first two acts. The film is primarily worth tracking down for the fabulous performances of the entire cast. Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher and Susan Sarandon form a wondrous trio and Jack Nicholson, well,  he demonstrates why he's righteously considered as one of the most gifted actors who ever lived.",The Witches of Eastwick
14,Boba_Fett1138,"Good entertainment, despite everything.",7,23 May 2011,"""The Witches of Eastwick"" always had been a movie that I enjoyed watching, ever since my childhood. It's some good quality entertainment, while it actually isn't even all that great as a movie.Main problem with this movie is that it actually as a very poor story, that actually make this movie a very pointless one as well. The concept of it is actually filled with plenty of potential but the story does far too little with it. You definitely should expect some more fireworks and magic from a movie that features the devil himself as one of your main characters. There just isn't enough happening really in this movie but yet the movie really still manages to work out as some great entertainment.Seriously, without all of its fine, well known actors, this movie would had been a totally bad and pointless one to watch. It really are all of the actors and their dynamics together. They give this movie so much and are the reason why the movie throughout remains such a perfectly watchable one, even when really not an awful lot is going on. The characters and actors really manage to keep things going and interesting. I hope the casting director received some sort of bonus afterward, since brining Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon, Cher and Jack Nicholson all together in one movie turned out to be pure gold. You can of course also never go wrong with having Jack Nicholson playing the devil.It's pretty unique for any sort of movie to feature 4 main characters, that each share an equal amount of screen time and importance to the movie and its story. You might start picking sides with one of them after a while but this is no real problem and the movie does a good job at making each and every character important, without that ever going at the expense of another.They even managed to let Susan Sarandon look somewhat attractive in this, which also really was an important aspect for the movie. It was important for all 3 female leads to be equally attractive, or else the entire aspect of the 1 guy going for- and living with 3 women wouldn't had worked out that convincing. It also comes across as convincing that the 3 leading ladies remain friends throughout the entire movie, despite everything they go through and all fall for the same guy. It's really thanks because of their acting skills but also really because they all shared some great chemistry together, as if they were all already good friends for years, before doing this film.You could perhaps also really thank director George Miller for this, as well as the movie its fine dialog. Director George Miller did not only manage to keep things going and interesting, despite of its lacking story, he also managed to make the movie, despite everything, such an enjoyable one. It's a movie with a light and pleasant sort of atmosphere. You can tell this is a movie made purely for entertainment and not for any awards. It's a movie with plenty of laughs in it and some enjoyable (supporting) solid characters. I miss this sort of entertainment. The sort of entertainment Spielberg also used to make earlier in his career, for instance.Still story-wise, the movie is a bit of a mess and I'm pretty sure there were lots of scenes left on the cutting room floor. That would explain so much as to why sometimes seemingly random stuff is happening in this movie and why some characters suddenly change appearance.But there really is plenty of other stuff to compensate for this, next to the earlier mentioned acting performances and dialog. The movie for instance also features some pretty good early special effects and a nice musical score by John Williams.All in all this remains some good entertainment to watch, despite of everything.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Witches of Eastwick
15,view_and_review,Witch Please!,5,1 September 2019,"So the question is: who had the good life?Three single women: Alexandra (Cher), Jane (Susan Sarandon), and Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) collectively wish for the perfect man. That man was delivered in the form of Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson). He was the answer to their prayers. He filled the holes in their lives. Each woman was happier, more fulfilled, and even more creative due to his presence. And for him? Three attractive fertile women that he could satisfy and keep happy.So I ask: who's fantasy was this?Ask just about any man and he'd love to have three women at a time that are all happy with the arrangement. And then the women in this scenario were all friends to begin with and were totally pleased with this man that could read them like a book and make them feel whole again.Too bad this dreamboat was the devil and they had to destroy him. As the saying goes: if something sounds too good to be true it usually is. At least he left them all with a little piece of himself. Not that Sukie needed a seventh child, but they all got a baby out of the deal.For my money, I wasn't a big fan of the movie. Were we talking women's lib? I wouldn't say so because their very happiness was tied to a man. Were we talking breaking from traditional values? Bravo! Not. Whatever the overriding message was intended to be I wasn't connecting with it. It did have its laughs which was good, at least I can say that much.",The Witches of Eastwick
16,evanston_dad,Who Knew Witches Could Be This Hot?,7,20 June 2008,"I might watch this film now and think that it's terrible, but my memory of it is that is was pretty decent. Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer play three smokin' witches, and they gang up in tormenting Jack Nicholson. I saw this when I was fairly young, so there's no doubt a lot of adult humor that went right over my head. I do remember a scene in which the three witches make Nicholson start coughing up chicken feathers -- that kind of freaked out my young brain.Obviously, I'm not the person to go to for a thorough summary of this film, so you're forgiven if you ignore my comments entirely.Grade: B+",The Witches of Eastwick
17,Aaron1375,"It was all right, but the plot is a bit incomprehensible.",6,23 August 2009,"This movie had good stars in it and they did a really good job with the scenes. Their acting was top notch. The plot, I could not tell you what this movie is about very well at all. The best I can figure is that the three main female characters obviously have some powers, or not at first. They somehow summon this guy that is supposed to be their dream guy or something or not. He proceeds to show them their powers, and kill this woman and then the girls turn against their dream guy and they have a final showdown with said guy. It sounds a bit messed up and it is. The story is not very clear what the heck is going on at all, still the performances make up for this flaw in the movie and they have some rather funny scenes in this flick too. If only they could have explained a few things better then perhaps it would have been an all around good movie. I suppose the book might have cleared up stuff a bit better, and when it was transferred over to film a lot of the crucial elements were lost in translation. Still, the movie really has good acting from Jack, Cher, Susan and Michelle.",The Witches of Eastwick
18,The_Void,"Decent fantasy horror, but not much more",6,19 October 2006,"The Witches of Eastwick blends a number of genres, including fantasy, horror and comedy, and somehow blends them all into a mostly coherent film about lust, sin and the age-old idea of 'be careful what you wish for'. I have to say that the film isn't really what I expected, as the title suggests witchcraft and this film is more angled around the drama surrounding the loneliness of its three central women, with some tentative satanic themes thrown in. Director George Miller has seen fit to cast all the central roles with strong personalities; and while Jack Nicholson stands out the most, the themes of the story and the other performer's aren't lost under his star profile. The plot centres on three New England women (Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michele Pfeiffer) who, bored with their lives, inadvertently conjure up the man of their dreams. Soon after, their town of 'Eastwick' is graced by the presence of Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson), a wealthy and handsome man who manages to satisfy the desires of all three women. However, Daryl has his own sinister motives...It has to be said the plotting is rather hit and miss, as the film features great slices of acting; such as the scene between jack Nicholson and Cher in his bedroom, but then this is offset by a lot of very silly instances, and what could have been a great film is marred by a too prominent sense of humour. Jack Nicholson is a delight to watch, however, as he lights up the screen at every opportunity and ensures that the film is always at least worth watching. Cher is my pick of the female leads as she provides the strongest and most memorable female character in the film. Both Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer are decent enough, but don't particularly stand out. The themes of the plot don't come across too well, and at times I wondered whether this film actually had a point to make or not. The director also seems to keen not to show any nudity, and this is a shame as The Witches of Eastwick features prominent themes of lust throughout, so some nudity wouldn't have gone amiss. But even so, despite many flaws and inconsistencies; The Witches of Eastwick is fun enough for a single viewing.",The Witches of Eastwick
19,JamesHitchcock,Just Your Average Horny Little Devil,6,12 August 2015,"Alexandra, Jane and Sukie are three friends living in the historic New England small town of Eastwick. All three are single- Alexandra is a widow whereas Jane and Sukie are both divorced- and are looking for a new man, but seem unable to find anyone suitable. And, unknown to anyone, even the women themselves, all three are secretly witches. And then the tranquil life of Eastwick is turned upside down by the arrival in town of Daryl Van Horne. Van Horne is ostensibly a wealthy New Yorker, but in fact he is, quite literally, the Devil. When he describes himself as ""just your average horny little devil"" he is speaking more truth than anybody actually realises. He settles down in the town, buying an old mansion, and quickly makes the acquaintance of the three women. In fact, he does more than make their acquaintance. He manages to seduce all three and persuades them to live in a ménage-a-quatre in his luxurious mansion, an arrangement which provokes much scandalised gossip among the good citizens of Eastwick.Van Horne, however, is intent upon using the three for more than just his own sexual enjoyment. He also wants to tap in to their latent magical powers and to use these for his own ends. At first Alex, Jane and Sukie are happy to go along with what they see as an amusing game, but eventually they begin to suspect that he is manipulating them into abusing their powers for evil ends, especially after Felicia Alden, Van Horne's most vitriolic critic in the town, dies a mysterious death. The women realise that they will need to resist Van Horne and start to fight back against him.I was not particularly taken with the three female leads, Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon, none of whom seemed very inspired. Jack Nicholson, however, seems to be gifted with the ability to give good performances even in otherwise run-of-the-mill films; ""Terms of Endearment"" is one such example, and this film is another. Nicholson has never been conventionally handsome, but he has the charisma needed for a role like Van Horne, playing him with a mixture of swagger and devilish charm and making him curiously attractive despite his satanic nature. The other notable acting contribution comes from Veronica Cartwright as Felicia. To her neighbours Felicia may seem like a crazed, superstitious religious fanatic, forever ranting about witchcraft, and yet she is the one person in the town perceptive enough to realise that what is going on at the Lennox Mansion is something far more sinister than mere sexual impropriety.The film's main weakness is its plot, which differs considerably from that of the John Updike novel on which it is supposedly based. It is a long time since I read the book, so will not pronounce on here as to which is better, but it struck me that the film starts off well but quickly goes downhill and by the time it reaches the ending is more or less nonsense. (This was a view shared by some critics; according to the ""Washington Post"" the second half ""lost its magic and degenerated into bunk"".) The scenes of Van Horne's arrival in town and his seduction of the women are well done, but after that the film seems to lose its way.""The Witches of Eastwick"" reminded me in a number of ways of ""Death Becomes Her"" from five years later. Both are black comedies with a supernatural theme. One positive feature they have in common is some decent acting. In ""Death Becomes Her"" this comes from Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as the two feuding rivals, with a good supporting contribution from Bruce Willis as the man they feud over. Both, however, are heavily reliant upon special effects; indeed, I would say that they are over-reliant upon special effects to cover up an unsatisfactory story-line. And neither film has really stood the test of time; both seem much less fresh and interesting today than they would have done in 1987 or 1992. Yesterday's ground-breaking effects will inevitably start to look commonplace; yesterday's good story will remain a good story today and tomorrow. 6/10",The Witches of Eastwick

Although from the title, I guess I was expecting something different. Still, for some odd reason, this movie more or less struck me as more of a TV series. Maybe because the plot is so Charmed meets Desperate Housewives, but it also worked as a movie.We have Jack Nicholson who plays the new man in the town of Eastwick, he's rich and mysterious, he also sleeps with three women who are best friends as well. He grants all their desires and wishes, not to mention makes them feel more alive then they ever have before. There of course is always a catch, Jack is a warlock, a very powerful one at that, not to mention an evil one. But after he is rejected by the girls, he decides to get back at them, not in the most pleasant way. The girls decide to trick him and use his own magics against him.Sometimes a comedy, sometimes horror, but over all I'd say that this movie is worth a watch. I mean, the stars alone are worth it, we have Oscar winners and nominee's. The story is original and entertaining, but like I said, you'll see what I mean, if this would've made a more entertaining TV series.7/10",The Witches of Eastwick

It's kind of a weird movie. Actually, come to think of it, really weird.But when the women include Michelle Pfeiffer and Cher and the devil is Jack Nicholson himself, you know you're at least in for something moderately entertaining - if not particularly special.And that's basically what ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is...moderately entertaining fluff. Women will probably get more of a kick out of it than men because of its sexual awakening jokes and everything. Men will get a kick out of Nicholson hamming it up (almost as much as Pacino would a decade later in ""The Devil's Advocate"").If you like the actors, give it a go. Otherwise, stay far away.",The Witches of Eastwick

First billed in the film, Nicholson continues his lucky streak in horror-maniac breed since his emblematic creepiness in THE SHINING (1980), whose inexplicable sex appeal has never been fully expounded, yet, all three women plain fall for him all of a sudden (maybe this is love's magic attribute). Then the polygamy orgy doesn't last long since (again inexplicably), a local woman (Cartwright, who unbelievably gives the best performance of the film) has been possessed by the devil and does some sort of tele-simultaneous stunts (in a pretty disgusting manner) and slaughtered by her bleeding heart husband. So 3D women apparently are shocked and start to doubt the real identity of their ideal man, who on the other hand, feels being snubbed by them and discharges a fit of torment on them and eventually 3D women unanimously fight back and voodoo the devil and manage to dispel him, later on their live happily with their children (who are the devil's seeds) while the devil is incarcerated inside the multi-TV screens. My recount is as inconsequent as the film goes, but there are my guilty pleasure moments, e.g. the near-end of Nicholson being witched by his own tele-simultaneous tricks, but the blithe spell is too short to be pleased by. Anyway it is glad to see director George Miller (from MAD MAX franchise) has re-regulated his career orbit, now he is the one running the show of animations, the Oscar winning HAPPY FEET (2006, a 7/10) is under his belt, which I could not have foreseen from this film in any event.",The Witches of Eastwick

Are the three ladies willing to pay the price for the man of their dreams? Watch this dark humored comedy to find out.Wonderful performances by everyone which will leave you laughing out loud.

Soon, wealthy and mysterious man Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) moves into town and seem to satisfy their desires. He seduces them one by one and ultimately begins an affair with each one, but bewitching activities soon follow.This movie has an interesting script and story that basically delves into the mystery and nefarious activities of witchcraft, which are comically and dramatically depicted in this film. Nicholson gave a outrageously crude-mouthed and wicked performance as Daryl, and Cher, Sarandon and Pfeiffer each did a pretty good job in their respective roles. There is a good amount of mystery in the movie to keep it suspenseful and a good amount of horror to keep it frightening at times, but entertaining (the cherry throw-up scene has always been a bit disturbing for me). The entire atmosphere and setting of the movie reminds you of a Salem era - perfect for a witches-themed film.Overall, the movie's not a masterpiece, considering some of the overly used crude elements and the diabolical aspects of the film.

26,sddavis63,Diabolically Funny!,10,29 January 2003,"This movie is worth watching if only for the performance of Jack Nicholson as Daryl Van Horne, conjured up by three lonely women from the small town of Eastwick (Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher and Susan Sarandon) as the answer to all their problems, who then discover that getting everything that they want in a man isn't necessarily a good thing! Nicholson is absolutely hilarious as the self proclaimed ""horny little devil"" who runs amok through the streets and churches of Eastwick, until the girls finally figure out a way to get their revenge. He will have you rolling on the floor with laughter here. It's hard to pick out any one scene of Nicholson's that particularly leaps out, but his seduction of Alex (Cher) is priceless and his performance in the church (""when God created women was it a mistake? Because if it was, maybe we can fix it!"") will have you in tears.Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon were all good playing what were essentially straight roles here, but they were overshadowed by Veronica Cartwright as Felecia, who understands that evil has come to Eastwick and is driven insane by it, much to the chagrin of her husband, poor Clyde (Richard Jenkins.) Cartwright was almost as hilarious as Nicholson.As funny as it is, the movie has its serious moments. I think particularly of Daryl slicing open a fruit to cause severe pain to Sukie (Pfeiffer). That was actually quite unsettling; made even more so by the overall hilarious tone the movie set.This is truly an excellent movie; a must-see in my opinion.10/10",The Witches of Eastwick
27,paul2001sw-1,Dumbed down to nothing,2,1 October 2013,"In John Updike's playful novel, 'The Witches of Eastwick', the ""witches"" are three ordinary divorcées considered such for two reasons: by others for their unconventional and active sex lives, and by themselves, as they start to fear that some occult games they engaged in have actually created the devilish new lover who appears in all their lives. This film starts reasonably true to the book; but soon descends into a terrible mess. The sexual element is downplayed, whereas the mystical element is taken increasingly literally. The move ends with an extended, excruciating sequence of supposedly comic horror; this is neither comic nor horrific, but moreover, stripped of the writer's subtlety, at least one scene becomes directly misogynistic. If the film's worth seeing at all, it at least gives one an exposure to its triple dosage of 19080s big hair; for a wry take on sexual politics, look elsewhere.",The Witches of Eastwick
28,MOscarbradley,A great guilty-pleasure.,7,10 June 2020,"Subtle, it ain't but George Miller's film version of John Updike's ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is extremely entertaining. Jack Nicholson, in a role you feel he was born to play, is Darryl Van Horne, 'just your average, horny little devil' who, it would appear, is conjured up by three New England women, (Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer), one stormy night and whose presence in their lives turns them into 'the witches' of the title. He's magnificent and very funny but the movie goes to pieces before the end. What starts out as a satire on New England prudery and what, I suppose, could be called 'the battle of the sexes' just becomes another Faustian horror-comedy about selling your soul to the Devil but, at least on that level, it's great fun, (and you do get the impression that these witches are having a ball). Throw in Veronica Cartwright as one of those New England prudes who sees Nicholson for what he is and not just a great lay with supernatural powers and you have a female-centered movie of the first order. It may be no classic but it's a great guilty pleasure.",The Witches of Eastwick
29,Bored_Dragon,"Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true",7,20 December 2018,"Three lonely friends who have lost their husbands gather once a week and their socializing usually ends up talking about men. On one occasion they wished for a mysterious stranger to come to their small town and bring them back to life. Jack Nicholson came but they got a lot more than they bargained for. And as the Serbian proverb says: ""A grandmother gave a dollar to get in the kolo (traditional dance), and now she would give two to get out.""Among the genres attributed to ""Witches from Eastwick,"" you can find fantasy, comedy, and horror. The latter is complete nonsense, and is it a comedy depends on your sense of humor. The story is witty fantasy drama, with well-written dialogues and replicas and one of the best film monologues I've ever heard. Jack Nicholson is just perfect, and the ""girls"" will sweep you off your feet. It is hard to believe that Cher and Susan Sarandon are over 40 years old in this movie, because their beauty and energy stand shoulder to shoulder with the then twenty-nine-year-old Michelle Pfeiffer. We should also mention Veronica Cartwright, whose role is secondary but quite important and whose performance may be the best in this film. Technically, the film is excellent, and I do not understand why they had to spoil it with terrible visual effects ten minutes before the end. It's just one scene in the entire film, but it looks literally like it was cut from a low-budget trash horror and then reattached here by mistake. In a two-hour movie, this lasts for under a minute, but it's so stupid and unnecessary and so does not fit into the rest of the movie that I had to lower my rating.7/10""Do you think God knew what he was doing when he created woman? No s***! I really want to know. Or do you think it was just another one of his minor mistakes? Like tidal waves! Earthquakes! Floods! Do you think women are like that?What's the matter? You don't think God makes mistakes? Of course, he does. We all make mistakes. Of course, when we make mistakes, they call it evil. When God makes mistakes, they call it nature. So, what do you think?

It is lighthearted, but not a comedy in the true sense, as there's this constant feeling from the beginning things are going to go very wrong.The acting and dialogue is very good. Jack Nicholson steals the show by a mile. He is absolutely FANTASTIC in this film! He is equally charming, seductive, funny and evil. He does it brilliantly. I didn't take Veronica Cartwright's character, Felicia, very seriously, although I think her role was intended to be a bit more serious, considering what she goes through.The final act is excellent, with some really good visuals and camera work. In general, this is highly entertaining look at three women who wanted more from life, and got more than they bargained for. Fantastic ending!",The Witches of Eastwick
31,filipemanuelneto,"Funny and highly provocative, it's an essay on the seductive capacity of Evil.",7,20 November 2021,"I confess that I expected something different from this movie, but I didn't feel dissatisfied with what I saw. It's an interesting and very provocative comedy that brings to the screen much of the content of a novel that I've never seen or read. The film, however, works on the basis of provocation for the audience, and launches barbs well aimed at our concept of God and Devil, of Good and Evil, our construction of moral values, the way we see women (or how it faces itself). It's a good movie, but it seems bent on annoying.The script is set in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, and where the arrival of a rich and eccentric new resident, who acquires a nearby mansion, is the reason for great confusion: he is strangely seductive in his way of being and speaking, and manages to charm three friends who end up romantically pairing up with him, which will cause scandal in the community, particularly in the more religious sectors. However, as they get to know him better, they begin to realize that they are capable of making what they really want to happen, and they will begin to learn to use these powers.It is with the arrival of the new resident that the film starts to get interesting, after almost fifteen minutes of preparation, introducing the characters and creating the environment. Strangely, and although it is obvious who the witches are, this is never said or discussed openly among them: they never come out and when they talk about their powers they do so almost without actually being plainspoken about it. For me, this worked poorly because it doesn't make sense, especially in a very tight circle of close friends, where one could generally speak more openly about any subject. Thus, the film leaves the magic and witchcraft almost implied. Towards the end, it insists on some lines that are highly provocative and make many moral and ethical issues questionable, even questioning the logic of divine creation by leaving the question whether God created Woman intentionally or did she end up being a ""failure of course"" of the Creator. I believe that some issues really bothered the public.There's no doubt that Jack Nicholson is the most striking face of this film, with an almost offensively sarcastic performance. He's ideal for the character, who combines cynicism and malevolence well with doses of charm that make us like him. As for the three witches, played by Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, I think they're great on their own and even better when they are together. It is quite visible throughout the film how the actresses understood each other and worked well together, and the quality of the interpretation reflects the effort and the combined work. Veronica Cartwright is, in my view, the actress who is responsible for giving the film a more regular villain, as her character, with tics of evident religious fanaticism, is the great opponent, both for the millionaire newcomer and for the three young companions who join him.Technically, the film has many values to consider, starting with tasteful cinematography, with a penchant for good wide-angle shots and aerial view perspectives. Good colors and a judicious choice of sets and filming locations (in particular the mansion, which is beautiful) help the film to have a truly elegant look and aesthetic. The film also has many special effects, convincing visuals and sound, with characters flying and levitating, tennis balls that seem to have a life of their own, cyclonic winds that seem to hit only one character amidst everything else and that unforgettable vomit that seems taken away from ""The Exorcist"". The music is masterfully used, helping to set the mood, starting right away with the idyllic and surreal environments of the mansion, with opera arias and classical music skillfully combined with an original soundtrack that is average but fulfills its role.",The Witches of Eastwick

As they creatively begin to ""dream him up,"" they have no idea that they are casting a very powerful summoning spell.Jack Nicholson was extraordinary as the Darryll ""Devil"" VanHorn - the result of the women's summoning; an obvious and well written metaphorical personification of the old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for.""

It was beautifully done in that it showed the true power of Sympathetic Magicks to those of us who cared to look.Of course things don't work on this plane as it does in the movie, but since Darryl was from the ethereal plane of Shadow, I think even the fantastic affects the girls' magick had upon him were very well portrayed.

Nicholson is having the time of his life in this wicked role & the ladies are all great & all look beautiful.

I personally think this is his best film, his MASTERPIECE of Cinema (yes even better than his Mad Max films) & we get a gorgeous score by John Williams. Everything about this dark horror comedy thriller is top notch filmmaking.The look & Cinematography is beautifully done & masterful & the mix of supernatural fantasy & darkly comic horror is perfectly pieced throughout.The Witches Of Eastwick also boasts gorgeous production design to go with these memorable characters & situations.I love how Van Horne (Nicholson) charms his way into a relationship with all three women at the same time & they become a kind of weird family that the townsfolk think are a bunch of sex crazed sinners lol plenty of laughs here & plenty of fun as we see not everything is as it seems. Daryl Van Horne is a horny little Devil & the ladies find out that too much of a good thing can be deadly!!! Crazy supernatural fun or just a bunch of Hocus Pocus?

This really has a cosy atmosphere & is ridiculously entertaining.

I thought it was very over rated.One of these days, maybe I will try it again-but I doubt things will be much different. I WANTED to like this but I found it hopelessly boring from the get go and added it to my list of ""never seen in its entirety movies"". And now I iwll read the other reviews and see if SOMEBODY agrees with me....",The Witches of Eastwick
44,Galina_movie_fan,"""Who are you? Just your average, horny little devil""",7,21 January 2005,"Jack Nicholson gives his funniest and one of the finest performances as Mr. Darryl van Horn, the mysterious and wicked man who arrives to the quiet and sleepy little town of Eastwick after three women, the Blonde Souki (Pfeifer), the Redhead Jean (Sarandon), and the Brunette Alex (Cher), best friends and witches dreamed him up as a man who can bring some changes and excitement in their lonely lives.Several great actors have played the Prince of Darkness during their careers but Nicholson was born to play a ""friendly"" devil that can seduce any woman with no exception by becoming exactly what she wants him to be. The scenes where Nicholson seduces Alex (Daryl Van Horne: Well, if that's how you feel about it, then that's how you feel about it. Is THAT how you feel about it?), Jean, and Souki are among the sexiest I've ever seen.The movie has too many vomiting scenes for my liking, and the visuals are sometimes too screaming but Nicholson is delightful. I never thought that playing cello could lead to such flaming results  and I used to play it. 7/10",The Witches of Eastwick
45,nycritic,A Great Quadrangle of Mischievous Witches.,10,6 April 2005,"Before HARRY POTTER and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES and after BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK came out and charmed the pants off moviegoers including me who, when we saw the film in theatres, loved not only the fantasy element, but also the great interplay between the actors.Loosely based on the John Updike novel of the same name, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK concerns the shenanigans of three housewives, all close with each other, who live in a sleepy New England town and dream of having a man come to their lives. What they don't know is that their empathic desires materialize not a knight in shining armour, but... Jack Nicholson? Surely you jest. Cher, the first to meet him, loathes him -- her verbal assault is something that belongs in an Edward Albee play. But he matches her word for word and bests her. Susan Sarandon, playing completely clumsy and repressed, gets ravaged in a bombastic way that would make any woman go nuts. And Michelle Pfeiffer in her breakout role meets a tender man who wishes he could be a woman.The key her is not the story: that the Devil has his own designs as Darryl van Horne and that he may have some eventual opposition from the town is predictable -- it's the way Nicholson embodies his role as van Horne. Pacino would do an over-the-top performance in THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE years later; Nicholson prefers to change his demeanor with regards to the women he gets involved in, and his Devil is almost an overgrown boy who just wants to have fun and enjoy life. Seeing him sharing screen time with such different actresses is worth the entire movie -- he oozes chemistry with all of them, he makes you believe he's that charming and sweet or passionate and maybe irrepressibly vulgar, full of his own cat-like sensuality. He's having fun, but making it known it's also not a one-note performance.Performances are what save this movie from its overblown ending and 80s production values: to watch Veronica Cartwright stealing her scenes, perfectly comfortable in playing these types of roles, go from concerned to completely mad, is a hoot. That she also may be a latent witch... is possible. Cher tackles her role like a total feminist and brings a lot of her own blunt self; Susan Sarandon does wonders to what in her own words was an underwritten part, and Michelle Pfeiffer glows.Great fun, fantasy at its purest form, THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK makes you want to draw a 'D' in the sand and see what happens.",The Witches of Eastwick
46,PredragReviews,The Devil made him do it...,7,30 April 2016,"OK. Decent acting, great directing work, story is funny, sexy, dark and sassy. Special effects are not bad at all considering it's a 1987 flick. That being said... This movie is great! If you're a fan of Sarandon, Cher, Pfeiffer, or Nicholson, you'll probably like it.A strange man, apparently summoned by three frustrated women, shows up in a perfectly ordinary American town. He soon will change their lives for the better or the worse. Filled with magic, symbolism and detail, the movie catches our attention from the start. Susan Sarandon's is the most fun to me, as she goes from super-dowdy to a free-spirited sexual being. And you've got to love Jack Nicholson being suave and evil as only Nicholson can be. Plus, Cher with huge infomercial hair! This film is wonderfully scored by John Williams (Jaws, Hook) and his music suits the film amazingly. I also thought that John Williams' score was fantastic and had this magical/mysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It's not his best score, but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also well-done, especially considering this was made in the late 80's. Still, this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller's versatility and the acting talents of its cast.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",The Witches of Eastwick
47,eric262003,Works Well For a Slightly Average Movie,7,30 October 2018,"When it was first released in 1987, I felt then and still to this day that ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is one of those timeless classics that you can go back upon and watch every so often and find newer discoveries through every viewing. Even though there is always something about this film that I could truly put a smile upon, it's still in the farthest distance from being anything but a definitive groundbreaking masterpiece.The weak point to this classic witch fantasy movie was that the script was too saccharine and sugary to even be regarded as a horror film, to the point that it is very misleading. And even though it was really never meant to be taken seriously, the story has really no point to it as well. There was a lot of material that could've been covered to its fullest potential, but there was little going for it that it felt way to lowered down like it was aiming for a younger audience even though there's a lot of profanity and sexual innuendos that make this film too dark for younger viewers. For a film in which the leading villain is the devil himself, you would expect this to have a more gritty, darker, sinister edge towards it and the leading protagonists are witches, you'd expect more hexes and spells played out more darker and less playful. But under all the ranting I've done, I do go back to watch this film because it does cure me for when I'm depressed.If it wasn't for the star quality provided here (Jack Nicholson, Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer) this movie would've totally been forgotten to the point of B-film obscurity. The performers are the bread and butter that make this film stand out and it's these stars that give it their all even if the material given to them is meagre. The performers take their characters and each an everyone of them add dimension and hold things together to convey a light charm and to hold your interest each time they light up the screen. Whoever the casting director was in charge I hope he/she gets a little more commission for casting a great ensemble of talented performers because it's stars like these that turned this pile of straw into gold. Nice touch of genius to cast smiling Jack as the ""average, horny little devil.""Many might think that casting four main stars could be problematic because very so often, two might get more screen time and the rest are rendered to just petty small supporting roles with little significance to the story. However in ""The Witches of Eastwick"", that's not the case. The four main stars get plenty of chances to shine and we are invested in all the characters and the situations they are facing. No need to pick sides here because they're all unique and have amazing stories behind their characters.For those wondering was it beneficial that the three witches had to be eye-candy gorgeous? You better believe it. Not trying to be sexist here, but it just wouldn't work to see the manipulative devil do his evil if he wasn't hitting upon three witches that weren't attractive. it also carries the film that the three witches have a strong bonding with each other even though they argue with each other while trying to win the heart over one man. sure it pays that their talent is rich but the chemistry they have towards each other is priceless. These three really can connect well like they were sisters.Another shout should go out to director George Miller for keeping his characters entertaining thanks to the wonderful dialogue. Even though the story isn't worth mentioning, Mr. Miller does succeed in making everything all the more enjoyable.Sure the horror genre can at times be misleading, if you prefer more light, pristine atmospheric films with a more fantasy level going for it, than this movie is for you. Sure it wasn't Oscar calibre or will change your life forever, the film was exciting and had a lot of laughs and the performers lead and supporting seemed to have fun in their respected roles. This kind of fun is absent in most of today's roles. These are the kind of films Steven Spielberg used to make before turning to more serious stuff.To further dive deeper into the awkwardness of the story which may seem like nitpicking, but it feels like a lot of stuff was edited out. Many scenes just tend to jump in randomly and there are times when characters just seem to look different through each scenes making everything feel incoherent.But there's much to celebrate about this film in terms of performances, characters and dialogue and the Miller's smooth direction. The foundation that truly hold this film together is brilliant score from the legendary John Williams. If you can get past the negatives, I recommend you will be entertained.",The Witches of Eastwick
48,pyrocitor,"Overblown, poorly conceived and enormously disappointing",3,3 July 2007,"As a story premise, The Witches of Eastwick held enormous promise - after all, who better to play the devil than Jack Nicholson, and when backed by such respected and charismatic actresses as Michelle Pfieffer, Susan Sarandon and a well renowned pop star such as Cher playing a trio of seductive witches, how could it possibly turn out as anything less than a wonderfully witty comedic success? Upon viewing the film, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but by the end, it's very easy to see the result for what it is - a hackneyed and ill conceived mishmash attempt at a romantic comedy thriller which ends up being neither romantic, comedic nor thrilling in any way whatsoever. While the movie boasted an excellent premise, it took screenwriter Michael Cristofer and Happy Feet director George Miller to mangle their source material, managing to turn an intriguing story into a patronising, imbalanced and out of control mess. The film ranges from dull and yawningly predictable to just plain surreal, never once managing to draw the audience in in the least, apart from certain moments of utter bewilderment. But if the shoddy helming wasn't enough, the film also inputs some shriekingly bad early attempts at CGI, (most memorably a 'devilish transformation' which would have been far more effective if it were simply implied, à-la Devil's Advocate, rather than garishly thrust on screen) which lose the film even further credibility. Even John William's score, which would normally be a high point of such a film, is far too over-dramatic to fit the tone, and simply seems out of place. It's hard to decide if the film's central weakness comes from the seeming indecisiveness as to whether to turn the film into a horror epic or romantic comedy, or simply shoddy directing and writing - either way, the result is excruciating to behold.It is tragic indeed to see such a tremendously capable cast put to such waste. Jack Nicholson is a master at playing sly and devious, imposing and dramatic, and witty and humorous, all without breaking a sweat. The role calls for all of these qualities, but he achieves none; resulting in an overly goofy and unconvincing performance, complete with a cringe-worthy and immensely distracting hairstyle. Cher is simply a deplorable casting choice, seeming constantly flat and emotionless, and never once convincing in her role. Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfieffer (especially the latter) try their best, but their characters are so poorly written that they are given little of interest to do except undergo painfully contrived seduction attempts by Nicholson's character. Both are capable of far superior work, and they appear to know it. The supporting cast almost unanimously overact to the point of hysteria, only adding to the viewer's overall feeling of disdain.All in all, The Witches of Eastwick may have started out as a clever idea and a superb cast, but ultimately the film falls short on essentially all fronts, mainly due to the shoddy, uninspired directing and weak, imbalanced script. It is truly tragic to see the legendary Nicholson reduced to such a level of mediocrity (though tiny traces of enjoyment can be obtained from him time to time, overall he is still a colossal disappointment) and sadly enough even the highly talented Pfieffer and Sarandon also fall short of their true potential. All parties involved are capable of far superior work, and it's highly disappointing to see such a talented array ending up with a film as poor as this. -3/10",The Witches of Eastwick
49,brchthethird,Well-told tale of an age-old struggle,7,7 January 2015,"From the director who brought us Mad Max comes a modern-day fairy tale of sorts that examines the age-old battle of the sexes. Alex (Cher), Jane (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) are three single women who live in the sleepy New England town of Eastwick. Since all of them lack a man in their lives, and are dissatisfied with the ones who are in town, they wish for a handsome stranger to visit. Miraculously, their wish is granted when Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) strolls into town and succeeds in turning their lives (and the town's) upside down. For the most part, I thought that the story was very effective in setting up its characters and giving them depth, even Daryl. The three women who are the titular ""Witches of Eastwick"" were all distinct personalities and had situations that made you care about them. Generally speaking, the performances were all very good, although Jack Nicholson towers above the rest of the cast as he brings his brand of insanity to what is essentially the devil in human form. Even the whole ""witch"" thing was dealt with rather subtly, as the women only become witches by finding the power within themselves. It is this struggle between male and female power which forms the core conflict of the film, and it is a compelling one even though it has been many times over in various forms. The townspeople are also given some development, although probably not enough to warrant the attention provided them. There are references made to the Salem witch trials, and the wife of the town's newspaper editor (Richard Jenkins...with hair!) acts as the mouthpiece for morality when the the three ""witches"" start their relationship with Daryl. Despite this interesting aside, I think it detracts a little bit from the main conflict. Moving on, I also thought that John Williams' score was fantastic and had this magical/mysterious quality that really meshed with the story and visuals. It's not his best score, but it was still a very good one. There were also a number of special effects by ILM which I thought were also well-done, especially considering this was made in 1987. Overall, I thought this was a very entertaining and funny movie that presented a well-worn theme in a fresh way. The only detraction, I think, is that there's a bit of a mean streak in regards to the portrayal of the male characters which might turn that half of the audience off. Still, this is a quality film that shows off director George Miller's versatility and the acting talents of its cast.",The Witches of Eastwick

I thoroughly enjoyed these three Eastwick witches and that really evil guy. This movie is near the top of its genre...whatever that is. Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game (when is he not)? Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pheifer and even Cher, show some excellent chops as well. Director, George Miller did such a good job bringing these folks into the fold of this orchestration. I would like to think that the cast makes this movie, but so many times I have seen flicks with a great cast and nothing else, thereby tanking an entire project. Directing, casting, producing and all that other filmmaking stuff is all masterfully mixed and delivered in a spectacular package of neatness.

51,Stampsfightclub,Exaggerated but enjoyable fantasy comedy/drama,7,17 October 2006,"This is probably THE weirdest film I have ever seen in my life. Despite being bizarre, it was a very good film to watch. Three renowned Americans star as the ""witches"", Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon. All perform well in an enjoyable strange story as they all one night recap their lives and wish for them to be turned around, that's when Van Horne, played brilliantly by Nicholson (One flew over the cuckoo's nest, as good as it gets) arrives in their home town. The story is exaggerated and unrealistic at points but regardless it is an engaging plot. You are always wondering what is happening and why, its strange but its gripping. It's a well thought out story with great acting from everyone involved. The pace and tension are key but also the relaxation and mystery surrounding the story make it enjoyable and ironically heart-warming.Some of the scenes involving the witches actions seem poor and deliberately stupid. Nicholson's character is phenomenal, a sensational character who is juxtaposed with the three witches to create a tense and interesting scenario. He is very seductive, mysterious and manipulating and therefore is simply great to watch. I was really unsure about the ending; I personally thought it was poor, completely over exaggerated. However it did leave many questions open and therefore encourages audiences to think carefully about it which makes it an interesting ending. There are many ideologies of sex, families, children, and a strong idea of religion encoded. Religion is a key issue in this film, the way people believe in heaven and hell. The use of story telling is also very powerful and influential to capture the character's views on life etc. Apart from the ending and some very unrealistic scenes it is an engaging story, worth watching once but not an essential watch. The characters and setting are amazing with an acceptable storyline. 7/10",The Witches of Eastwick

So , what went wrong ? The movie is simply unfunny.I liked the performances of the cast. The special effects look really good even after all those years. As I said earlier the idea for this movie is original and interesting. The movie does say something about mentality of small town society and the desires of women.The movie however is no fun. It's supposed to be horror-comedy , yet it fails as both horror and comedy. It's not scary , but what is worse is that is not one bit funny. I honestly don't see where all the jokes are. Where are the moments when I was supposed to laugh ? Can somebody tell me ? I can't even say that this movie has forced humor , because I don't see ANY humor here. The whole movie feels like the movie makers were having fun with special effects , but nothing more.""Witches of Eastwick"" are dull compared to ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Gremlins"".

54,Ben_Cheshire,Oh what could have been...,6,26 April 2004,"I feel sorry for Australian George Miller, director of the iconic Mad Max and and Max Max 2, for this, one of the only other major films he's directed is a sad misfire.And what a near success it was too: how can you go wrong with Jack Nicholson playing the devil, Susan Sarandon doing what she does best: seeming to be reserved and prudish then turning around and into a sensual, sexual little mama, a great fun witchy score from John Williams and a story about sex, magic and witches! Cher and Pfeiffer look great, if nothing else. They at least do no physical harm to the picture.Direction is the main thing missing, unfortunately for Mr Miller. Firstly, the script needed rewrites: there are major things which go unexplained, like how the girls are never really shocked at their witchy powers when they finally realise they have them, a major moment of the ball-dropping is not enough reinforced, why the girls move in with some weirdo they don't know, whether they ever realise he's the Prince of Darkness or not, and in general the script is clunky and mechanical. The movie plays out like a poor adaptation of a book - with weak connections between scenes, overlong dialogue scenes, episodism and a generally disconnected plot. And the script started it off with these problems. Miller was the guy who should have said this script is not good enough. But then, instead of trying to improve it by stepping up the pace, he directs it in a languished, over-wrought style. There is by far too much silence for a movie about witches. He wasn't sure what he was making here: drama, sex-comedy, fantasy, tragedy, action or what - and each scene betrays this. For a movie about magic, there is a distinct lack of magical happenings, which are all mainly replaced by an out-of-place storm-and-action filled finale, at the centre of which is stop-motion animation.Each of these scenes should have been shorter, more fun, have better motivation and explanation and more music. Williams' score doesn't play through enough of the picture, again which is more suited to drama than comedy.Jack, the main reason i was watching this, does his best to fight the director's snail-like instincts at every turn, but still can not rescue the suffocating drawn-outness of the whole procession. He's still a total scene-stealer, and still great fun as the devil, but thanks to Miller, not nearly enough fun, which was the main thing that ruined the whole experience for me. This strange tale of witches, devils and magic did not have enough of a sense of humour to not take itself too seriously.",The Witches of Eastwick

There are some entertaining scenes in this film but there are problems too. Once Nicholson arrives on the scene, I don't understand why all three woman continue to vie for his attention. It makes no sense to me that these three woman who have supposedly been lifelong friends would fight over the same man; however, this film is completely watchable due to the hammy, overblown performance by Jack Nicholson as Daryl/The Devil.

Basically, that is what this movie is about in a nutshell. And yet, this film works on pretty much every level with engaging characters, strong dialogue, great cinematography and camera work, and good special effects. I saw this one years ago when it first hit the theaters - it's been decades since I've seen it ... until tonight. Surprisingly enough, it still holds up pretty well.Three friends, Alex (Cher), Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Jane (Susan Sarandon), meet together regularly every Thursday night to share a bottle of wine and anecdotes - each of them single and unhappy. One night, they discuss their dream man, which must have tickled the ears of Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson), ushering him into town and causing an immediate stir among the locals. He seduces all three of them, playing to their weaknesses until it becomes a problem, and they want out. When he makes it very clear that they can never leave him, they exact their own measure of revenge.This film catches all of our stars in their prime. Our three protagonists have never looked better, and Nicholson was at his devious, comedic best. I had a lot of fun watching this lost gem again, having forgotten most of it. Yes, the ending is a bit over the top with the special effects, but still fitting to the overall plot. I liked the way it turned out. However, if the sight of profuse vomiting offends or disgusts you, this is not a film for you - lol.I highly recommend ""The Witches of Eastwick"". After it was finished, I almost wanted to start it over and watch it again.

The devil comes to earth to spawn. He seduces the three women and when they find out who he is, they also discover they have magical powers and use them to get rid of him. Well, not entirely. The ending is one of the more insane ones I have seen in a mainstream movie.Jack Nicholson has enormous fun. Could you picture anyone but him in this part? Al Pacino tried a decade later and failed in The Devil's Advocate. The problem, I think, is the plot doesn't service him that well. He doesn't do a lot of damage and his intended minions aren't really dealt with in an intelligent manner.One great thing is the woman played by Veronica Cartwright.

58,DavidSim240183,Bewitched meets Bedazzled,9,13 November 2008,"The Witches of Eastwick, based upon the bestselling novel by John Updike was the first Hollywood feature from George ""Mad Max"" Miller. The Mad Max trilogy established Miller as a director of tremendous promise. Indeed, when he directed the final story for Twilight Zone: The Movie, although unknown, he ended up making the best story in the entire film. So it was with The Witches of Eastwick that he got the chance to show Hollywood proper what he could really do.But The Witches of Eastwick was a very troubled production behind the scenes. The Australian Miller didn't get along at all with the Hollywood producers, who kept interfering with his decisions. It got so bad that production of the film was shut down until Miller's demands were met. And even Jack Nicholson threatened to walk off the set if the producers replaced Miller. The experience was so upsetting for Miller that he returned to Australia, and has yet to make another film in America.Not surprisingly, Miller's output since has been extremely sporadic. It would be five years before he returned to the directors chair, and even then, the films he's made are unworthy of him. With the exception of the superb Happy Feet, a film that marked a return to the playing field for Miller. And a return to form.When you finally watch The Witches of Eastwick, you wonder what it was the producers were so worried about. I don't know what they're problem with Miller was. Because none of those backstage production headaches had any effect on his direction. Its a wholly enjoyable film. One of the most entertaining black comedies ever made. A near perfect delight.In the fictional town of Eastwick, single women Alex (Cher), Sukie (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Jane (Susan Sarandon) are bored. They live in a town so boringly respectable they're just dying for something to shake up the place. And that something is Jack Nicholson. Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson) blows into town, a mysterious stranger, and one by one, seduces each of the three women. But it turns out Alex, Sukie and Jane are witches, Daryl is The Devil, and now they've summoned him into they're lives, its not so easy to get him out.Few films satisfy like The Witches of Eastwick. Everything about it is marvellous. This is a film that gives you pleasure by just regarding it. Because there is so much to like. The film is a visual treat. It has a wonderful music score from John Williams, one that finds an epic sweep one minute and a whimsical one the next. The script from Michael Cristofer takes us through the several nuances of seduction and betrayal. And it has a superb ensemble cast. One of the finest ever assembled.When it comes to actors playing The Devil, no one is more qualified than Jack Nicholson. Put horns and a goatee on him and he would even look a dead ringer for Satan. One suspects George Miller wouldn't have had the slightest interest in directing if Nicholson hadn't agreed to sign on. Unlike The Shining, where Stanley Kubrick made the mistake of putting him into a part he wasn't right for, Miller knows he's got the right actor, which is why he allows Nicholson to play things to the hilt. In The Shining, it was just plain annoying. In The Witches of Eastwick, its a tour-de-force.This is a role that fits Nicholson like a glove. A known womaniser in real life, he brings so much conviction to the part. Its tailor-made for him. With those eyebrows that arch into the air, and that Cheshire cat grin he can do so well, he leers and sneers his way through the film. Large as life, he gets some great opportunities to give it all he's got. Denouncing women one minute, seducing them the next. Not only does he grin like a Cheshire cat, he purrs like one!But we mustn't leave out the women. They all give great performances. As the sensible Alex, Cher provides a steady anchor. The bit where she points out all of Daryl's faults is an instant classic. Michelle Pfeiffer is as lovely as ever. She always plays better in offbeat roles, and does so here.But its Susan Sarandon who gives the best acting of the three. Always a greatly underrated actress, she gets one of her best roles here. A prim and proper music teacher, who becomes a seductive, sexual temptress. She has great chemistry with Jack Nicholson. The film fires itself up whenever they're paired together. Especially the scene when he teaches her to pour her emotions into a difficult music piece, and transforms before our very eyes. Its a superb performance.An often overlooked performance comes from Veronica Cartwright, a woman who stands for all good and purity, and goes through a Linda Blair like possession. Veronica Cartwright came off a bit neurotic in Alien, but when turned toward black comedy, her through the roof hysterics become quite funny.Most people who've seen The Witches of Eastwick think it falls apart at the end. Although I'm a huge fan of the film, it does seem a little unsure of itself in the second half. It ends with a lot of running around and special effects, as if George Miller didn't know how to end it. But its still fun all the same. Who couldn't love a scene where Daryl vents his hatred for women in church while he vomits up cherries on the ushers? Despite the uncertain ending, its still a wonderful film. And such an addictive treat. Jack Nicholson's broad performance is brilliant. The set design is sumptuous. And it sounds magnificent. I notice new things every time. A film I can never get enough of.",The Witches of Eastwick
59,AvidClimber,The Witches of Eastwick — A light magical comedy about empowering women,7,28 December 2012,"The Witches of Eastwick is a light comedic tale about women in a small town, their status as single parents or divorcé, and about magic.The story itself and the plot are quite interesting, well written, directed and edited. No complaints on that level. You're rapidly plunged into the thick of it, and everything moves at a rather rapid pace. Each scene is well set and linked with the others. The intrigue thickens with each one passing, and the end is nice, logical, and well rounded.Now for the bad. The three main female characters are probably the least well acted. Cher's, from the get go, is over acted or maybe simply over done, but in Hollywood, that happens often at the beginning of movies. Michel Pfeiffer's is probably the most balanced and best acted of them. Susan Sarandon over does hers in the middle of the story. Maybe that's the director's fault, maybe he pushed them a little too much.That being said, I must say that some of the monologues of Veronica Cartwright and Jack Nicholson are impressive in delivery and content.It's a movie that's easy to watch and will make you think if you stop a minute to consider the implications.

60,Rammstein-2,Underestimated and underachieved,7,11 January 2000,"I say this film is underestimated. Not only is the story quite handsome, the actors act their finest - especially Jack Nicholson who, given the right script, lets fly his brilliance every once in a while. The story of the devil's arrival and his impact on a small community in general and three of its women in particular, with a twist of eroticism and self-indulgence, is at its best in this movie. The ending, however, bears a striking resemblance to The Golden Child, and should have been reworked.",The Witches of Eastwick

He is outstanding as Daryl. I have the tape and the beginning of the every Fall I tend to watch it,   I guess: (1) It came out in the Fall; (2) The advertising for the film was ""something wicked this way comes"" And Halloween is just around the corner. By the way because of Halloween's tradition, it is not on my favorite list of Holidays perhaps there is nothing ""holy"" about it! This is a sleek, sexy comedy with a touch of horror. It more fun than fear really!  Unless you start thinking  that the people who put the movie together really researched  the occult and know exactly the power of evil forces. Which they did! But I tend to leave judgment aside and enjoy the movie. I like acting, and an actor like good a good lawyer cannot judge. That is for judges and judgmental people! The movie is set in one of those New England towns that everybody wishes they lived in. All cute little white houses, with white picket fences.  The photography is great in part because of the cute place.  There are three best friends: Oscar winner and fitness guru Cher (Moonstruck) plays Alexandra Medford; Oscar winner Susan Sarandon (Dead Men Walking) plays Jane Spofford, a very prudish music teacher, whom I like best without the red wig, and Oscar nominee, Michelle Pfeiffer (Scareface) is Sukie Ridgemont a journalist who has bunches of kids. Their friendship is enviable. Veronica Cartwright, has one of the most interesting parts in this movie, she is the sensitive good person who dies because she sensed the evil surrounding  her and the city. However in the movie, the viewer is led to think that she is the bad guy. Veronica Cartwright played very well the part of Felicia Alden. Alexandra, Jane and Sukie have the unconscious power to make things happen. They wished to date a nice man, typical feelings for women, and there comes Van Horne. I always have a good time watching this comedy. My favorite quotes:   Daryl Van Horne:    "" Little! But potent!"" ""Ballroom, interesting word: ballroom!"" ""Don't let her get to you, have a cherry! Have another cherry, here another cherry."" ""I called first because that way you feel superior and see me at the same time."" Van Horn understands women!  My favorite scenes: The tennis match and its special effects. A memorable scene: the projectile vomiting also used on the movie The Exorcist.

63,Darkjak007,"Death,Desertion,Divorce",6,18 October 2021,"The witches of Eastwick tells the story of three women Alexandra(Chear) Sukie(Michelle Pfeiffer)Jane(Susan Sarandon)who all share the same common problem they are single either divorced or widowed. They feel that their life's isn't really exciting or going anywhere and wish that they had a special someone in their life. One night they sit around drinking and having fun joking about what the perfect man would be like. The next thing you know A strange man by the name of Daryl Vanhorn(Jack Nicholson) walks into the town and while while the rest of the town is Isn't very keen about him the girls grab his attention and over time he tries to seduce them.they eventuality find out that there's something strange about him and theirselves. The misconception that can easily be made about the movie is that is seems as like a horror comedy, and does borrow some elements with the theme of magic and religious symbolism. It's really more of a romantic comedy about three women down on their luck. The supposed Man shows up Quite possibly not the person they really need or want, that's a really having children are stronger together. The most part it's a decently entertaining film the characters play well off each other's especially especially the ladies having fun you feel like there is a bond between them and they do have all kinds of chemistry from encouraging each other to being jealous of the other. Adding jack Nicholson to the mix makes it all the better doesn't really come off as perfect. But he owns the weather charming if not creepy or scummy persona. He easy delivers most of the funniest lines in the film. All four of them sell this movies charm. So obviously out of the three the one that the most focused is Cher obviously because even back in those days for the time her and Jack were the two most famous. Unfortunately I feel like one of the faults with the movie is the fact that the way it was marketed it's not really as fun raunchy mystery of film as it could be have been. There's only really a couple magic scenes in the movie, like the voodoo doll there need to be a couple more of those moments. The film is almost two hour long and there are some moments I do feel like they drag her bed or not really necessary they could've been filled with stuff like that.",The Witches of Eastwick
64,patriciogl10,Tempting like the forbidden fruit.,6,15 November 2019,"There's another film that comes to mind as charmingly absurd as this, Robert Zemeckis' Death Becomes Her. Although the latter is much more silly in tone, they share much elements that make them oddly similar. The Witches of Eastwick is George Miller's take on horror comedy, even though the ""horror"" element is not so much horror per se but more fantastic in nature, as the tone for it is completely harmless. Jack Nicholson excels in his highly effective charming portrayal of the dark prince. He was defintely born to play seductive roles with his natural charisma and animal magnetism, which serves this film exceedingly well. As for the witches, Sarandon, Cher and Pfeiffer also prove to be up to par with Jack's performance by adding something different to their own dynamic with him, as he seduces all three separately.Writing this review actually made me want to rewatch the film, as it is thoroughly entertaining. It exudes an irresistible allure that I find completely spellbinding. Don't read any more reviews and immerse yourself in the fantasy!",The Witches of Eastwick

Some of the humor is about how men are dicks and women are great and this movie tries to make the women just petty,horny and stereotypical and stereotypes aren't funny to me.. Jack Nicholson was a strange choice. He's old, ugly and out of shape. But is that part of the joke?? I dont get it and this show is pretty forgettable.

67,quaseprovisorio,supernatural tale about women empowerment that is a bit unbalanced but a fun watch nonetheless.,7,29 June 2020,"Witches of eastwick has very cool things going on: it's not afraid to show what women need to do in order to be accepted in a traditionalist society. unfortunately is too easy: husband and children. being a single widow, divorced, alone, would raise questions. mostly in a small town where everybody knows each other and expects everyone not to run from the norm. because it would be weird to admit people can be different and no one wants to analyze their lives in order to check if they're happy or not.these three women start to feel empowered by daryl. yes it is a man empowering them, giving them the self esteem, the care, the needs they had. with the right words at the right time they would be his(yes quoting tracy chapman here). but what the movie makes is giving them a journey throughout his presence, until they reach a satisfatory and proper conclusion. we might find the way the film protraits these three women a bit simple and easy but at least we can understand they're different from each other.in a weird way nicholson is jennifer kent's babadook. he's the vehicle where they need to process all their pain and frustrations until they become themselves. the liberation vs traditionalism, the nice men, the jerks, the cynical men, vs women that are on this to become their own identities. jack nicholson embodies a lot of different characteristics in order to fulfill the desires of these three women.i'm not a big fan of men vs women quotes but the movie makes a good job on not being much cliche'd or predictable in terms of the visual ideas. the supernatural tone into it was actually what i enjoyed the most. not only because we have nicholson into his full force that i think everybody loves, but also because the visuals were funny and gross. the movie was brave in the way it chooses to show the gross debauchery. that's actually for me the biggest point of this.
what i think it could be better is how the movie balances this ideas. women empowerment, vs the comedy tone, vs the supernatural, vs the traditional and religious. sometimes all of these themes are not totally well balanced. that's why i don't give a bigger grade. however it's a very cool picture with things to say, good interpretations, and courage to be poignant and sometimes also desgusting. it's a cool crazy ride - even though i love george miller because of mad max i wonder if tim burton would have put his hands on this. that would probably make this film a cult classic today.there aren't that many mainstream movies with this guts. oh and i enjoyed the ending. plus three good performances vs a always great nicholson is more than a reason to give this a go.",The Witches of Eastwick

70,danielll_rs,For the ones who like witch-craft...,8,6 November 1999,"""The Witches of Eastwick"" is recommended for all the ones who like to see things about witch-craft. If you watch the TV show ""Charmed"" or liked ""The Craft"", you can't miss this one.The story is quite simple: three single women, unhappy with their lives, beg for help using the black magic. Suddenly, the women (played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and Cher) meet a man named Daryl Van Horn (Jack Nicholson), and then things start to change- for good... or bad.With much black-humor, a good story and many dark elements, ""The Witches of Eastwick"" turns into a very good film.",The Witches of Eastwick
71,thefan-2,The devil is in the details,10,20 March 2000,"John Updike has written some wonderful novels. I can only think the reason they haven't been adapted to film is that their strengths lie more in their verbal felicities than in the kind of forceful plotting and characterization Hollywood loves. I don't think The Witches of Eastwick is any more suited to movie adaptation than, say, Couples or ""S."" It succeeds so well, with only a little tweaking, that it makes you wonder what we've been missing. The chief glory of this movie is the beautifully detailed production. You can't precisely capture Updike's masterful use of the language on film, but the careful attention paid to the minutiae of the three witches' lives and the town they inhabit is the best approximation I've ever seen. You can't take your eyes off this movie. I've read a lot of praise for Jack Nicholson, in the role of the devil, but I think he might be the weakest element. The production itself is the real star here.Highest recommendation.",The Witches of Eastwick
72,highwaytourist,Over the top film is occasionally fun,6,17 October 2008,"The cast alone seemed to be worth the price of admission. But the writers and director didn't know what they wanted to do with the material. It osculates wildly from comedy to romance to disaster movie, with the story alternating from gross-out humor (the film has the most vomit scenes in movie history) to satire of a puritanical New England that hasn't existed in ages. Three women (Cher, Susan Sarandon, & Michelle Pfeiffer) are lonely and bored with their mundane lives in a small New England town. They cast a spell and viola, Jack Nicholson appears to them. While Nicholson wouldn't seem to be the fantasy man of many women (he looks like a bum in this film), the three leads go ga-ga for him. It's suggested that he's the devil, but you'd think that the devil would be more powerful and bold than here. But if that were the case, the ending would have to be changed. No one seemed to have any idea what to do with the material, and this spread to the actors. Michelle Pfeiffer is the exception, as she gives the best performance in the move. As for the rest, Jack Nicholson simply revises his character in ""The Shining,"" while Cher is sullen and Susan Sarandon goes through the motions. Veronica Cartwright, who has given good performances in the past, is little more than a stereotype, a serious version of The Church Lady from ""Saturday Night Live."" While some of the humor works, it more often falls flat. As a result, the films technical expertise is wasted. The photography is genuinely beautiful, and the special effects are good, if inappropriate for the story. In fact, the climax seems to have been inspired from the old Irwin Allen disaster movies. The star power was enough to carry the movie financially, and thankfully, there were no sequels.",The Witches of Eastwick

The film centres around Jack Nicholson seducing three women and when he does seduce them it's seen as him being incredibly clever delivering long, long speeches that we're supposed to believe lead to these women falling hopelessly in love with him but instead would likely lead to him getting slapped. The three leads, Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher and Susan Sarandon, while all talented actresses in their own right, are just okay in this film, and even Jack Nicholson struggles to bring any energy to the table, hindered by the plainness of the script. The cinematography is okay, the special effects fine but all in all this film just comes off as a big load of nothing, I watched for 50 minutes before having to stop and I never felt compelled to finish it.Would not recommend.",The Witches of Eastwick

76,cwrdlylyn,"WITCHES OF EASTWICK : Symbolic Sexuality, Subtle Themes, & Great Performances",9,14 June 2006,"THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK George Miller's 1987 adaptation of John Updike's hit novel has always been a movie I admired and wanted to love more then I ever actually did. But something about the film was so bizarrely intriguing that I have always returned for repeat viewing sporadically throughout the years. Upon reflection, I think I always expected it to be a different movie then it is... b/c I finally feel that I understood what the film aimed to be.In the past, I always watched the movie expecting a spectacle of witchcraft and fantasy... but in reality that's not what one should expect from this movie. ""The Witches Of Eastwick"" is a sexual suspense film with an underlying supernatural mystery.It tells the story of three bored women (Cher, Susan Sarandon, & Michelle Pfeiffer) who don't seem to realize the powers they possess. They live in the town of Eastwick, where not much happens for these women, especially when it comes to eligible bachelors. One night, they decide to wish for the arrival of a worthy man who can offer all the things they most desire. To their surprise, the next day, a wealthy bachelor moves into the town's landmark mansion and he is ready to woo the three ""witches"" of Eastwick.Alex (Cher), Sukie (Pfeiffer) and Jane (Sarandon) all eventually fall under the spell of their magical suitor, Daryll Van Horn (played by Jack Nicholson). He appears like magic and offers them all the fantasies and pleasures they had hoped for. However, for another resident of Eastwic, Daryll represents evil. Felicia Alden (played wonderfully by Veronica Cartwright) suffers from hysterics as she is the only person to sense Daryll's evil plan.Little by little, the women realize that Daryll is not exactly a magical blessing. Instead he is a demon/devil who took advantage of the dark magic they accidentally used to summon him. Turns out Daryll, or the devil's plan was to unite with these three witches to create his offspring. But once the witches find out they've accidentally opened the door for a demon to enter Eastwick, is there still time to stop him? What sounds like an outlandish plot of fantasy and horror is actually handled with a great deal of subtlety up until the film's climax. The majority of the film uses cunning sexual symbolism to allude to Daryll's inner-devil. He playfully seduces the women by saying exactly what they want to hear... but little do the women know it's b/c he's a powerful demon who can manipulate their needs and desires like a true Casanova. Symbolic links between sexual desire and seductive bliss are apparent through the emphasis on such things as snakes and ""forbidden fruit"".One thing that is so interested about ""The Witches Of Eastwick"" is that it never bends to the audience. The undertones of the film are subtle and nothing is ever spelled out for us. Our only clues to Daryll's true identity are in Felicia's incoherent rants. However, slowly but surely George Miller offers revelations that link Felicia's theory and Daryll's actions so that the audience realizes the truth about the situation.The performances in this film from the 5 leading players help to elevate both the depth and the ""cool"" factor for the film. Jack Nicholson doesn't bring much nuance or subtlety to the role of Daryll... however, he is barrels of evil fun here. Without reserve, Nicholson captures the total evil of Daryll mixed with his primal need to hold onto the women he lusts after. And those women are all portrayed with equal confidence and talent. Cher, as the leader of the pack Alex, brings a tough as nails attitude to the role while layering her with a woman who still yearns for the protection of a man. Pfeiffer, as the free-spirited Sukie, brings an innocent awareness to the only character who seems to believe in the powers the girls possess. And meanwhile, Sarandon is tons of fun as plain Jane turned sex addict... her's is the most fun performance of the Witches.And to top it off, the film features a dynamite supporting performance from Veronica Cartwright. It's a role that could have gone high-camp very easily, but Cartwright grounds it with so much conviction that it works beautifully. Prepare for the scene in her house with her husband (think of Cherry Pits)... it's a good one.Watching ""The Witches Of Eastwick"" in the past, my favorite part was always the finale. In it's final 15 minutes, the movie turns into a special effects action sequence. These final moments are most exciting because it is the only section of the film in which the Witches use their powers knowingly. Where-as in the past I had hoped more of the movie would be about the magic/fantasy elements... upon this viewing I came to appreciate the slow burn the movie uses to build up to it's grand climax.While the film is not perfect... it is an interesting time at the movies. It offers a handful of fun performances from actor's who clearly had a ball making this film. It also keeps the audience guessing for almost the entire film by keeping many elements under the surface. Sure the film maybe could have been a little shorter, and having not read the book I'm not sure whether it lives up to the source material. But for me, ""The Witches Of Eastwick"" is a really great film that only improves with repeat viewings.... B+ ...",The Witches of Eastwick
77,raymond-massart,The eternal struggle for power and recognition,8,15 January 2007,"As was mentioned in another review on this site, when watching ""The Witches"" for a second or a third time, one tends to concentrate more on the content and the ensuing message it conveys than on the visual thrill the movie has to offer. The subject matter is obviously an allegory of the battle of the sexes and the recognition of the abyss that separates men from women or to put it in more lay terms: the impossibility of man ever understanding woman and vice versa.The devil in this case is the male in his most extreme form: with just one preoccupation on his mind, and we all know what that is, he considers his female counterpart exclusively as an object of lust. The use of the term ""mind"" in the previous sentence was intentional and an important element as the male is all too well aware of the passion that drives him but also of his unsuccessful attempts at satisfying his logical side, namely by finding a rational explanation for the world he lives in. In his opinion the clash between the rational and the irrational isn't reflected in the woman he desires and this observation not only frustrates him but adds to his confusion. Do the three witches represent woman as seen by man? Apparently they do: although they initially seem to have their own unique personality they soon blend together by certain traits most men attribute to women in general: notwithstanding their seemingly high moral standards they easily succumb to the cave man tactics of the outrageous seducer and rapidly adapt their life style to one of luxury and debauchery. At one point it is Sukie ( Michelle Pfeifder) who states that women are more a part of nature than men as they go with the flow of the absurdity of life. A rather cynical reference to the values of women is the ludicrous appearance of Felicia (Veronica Cartwright) , the editor's wife, who's moral principles drive her to madness. Who comes out the winner of this battle of the sexes? Without any doubt: women. When required, they can leave their rivalry, envy and jealously behind and punish even the most virile of men. The final scene shows the triumphant witches who have apparently obtained what they really wanted to achieve: a thriving matriarchy where surrounded by babies, they can conjure up the devil (man) on a screen and delete him whenever they wish. As stated above ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is an allegory...",The Witches of Eastwick
78,PeachesIR,Amusing social commentary,8,26 September 2021,"""The Witches of Eastwick"" is more satire than scare despite the witch coven and demonic goings-on in the plot. I believe the John Updike novel was much darker, but this movie version goes for sly laughs and social satire. It's more of a commentary on the objectification and disposability of women in society, as the three witchy women stars are all single and don't really ""fit in"" in their prim, judgmental New England town despite being hard-working and intelligent professionals (journalist, educator/musician, artist). Their lives change dramatically when they hook up with wealthy, mysterious, wicked newcomer Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson in one of his most flamboyant roles, and he is fantastic here), but this arouses suspicion and disapproval from their neighbors. I think this movie holds up very well, although the classic feminist themes were more relevant when this was made in the '80s and may seem odd or archaic to modern, younger viewers. The movie works mostly due to the strong performances of its cast, including Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer as the witches/best buddies, and the stellar Veronica Cartwright as Felicia, the moralizing grande dame of the town, who steals every scene she is in. One of the juiciest hits of the mid-'80s, ""The Witches of Eastwick"" is still a fun, entertaining movie.",The Witches of Eastwick
79,GoUSN,"My take, 26 years later",1,27 August 2013,"I suppose having Jack Nicholson play the usual Jack Nicholson character was thought by some to be a casting coup - and a masterpiece would be born. Cher. Sarandon. Pfeiffer. A real casting coup. All they needed was a script.They didn't get it with this dreck. The Hayes Code is long gone, but movies like this tell us why codes evolve in the first place: hideousness built on wretchedness heaped on tastelessness served on poor writing pretending to be clever and wry. With Satan as obnoxious centerpiece.When anything can be filmed and standards evaporate, shock shlock results - attention earned not by great dialogue, clever sets, smart comedy, but by puking, mocking, and dialogue out of a bad True Detective parody.Satan comes into the lives of three women in small-town America. In one choice vignette, he gives a mocking, foul speech in a church. In another, he gives a mocking foul speech . . . Well you get the drift. Foul speech, puke, foul speech, puke, interspersed with not the slightest bit of cleverness. A high school film project effort where the teacher never showed up to advise.Hideous.",The Witches of Eastwick
80,nifabs,hilarious,7,22 June 2003,"I totally agreed with Cher when she told Jack Nicholson what she thought of him.  I don't see what the fuss is about the ""runt"", he's got about as much talent as Pia Zadora.  The three  leading ladies steal the show by playing it straight while Mad Jack as usual goes over the top.  Cher(a better singer than an actress) reveals an equally famous midriff while mouthing one liners, as the most sensible witch, Susan Sarandon's limpid eyes are pools of emotive delight, she tells all through them and should have been given the lead in the spark-fest.  Michelle Pfeiffer as the youngest witch with a brood of kids is zany but grounded as she tries to bring some semblance of order into her life.   This lethal combo outshine Nicholson's Devil winningly and you are left gasping at the climax, well directed, well acted and well watched!!!!

81,Queen_of_pentacles,What do women want ?,7,11 September 2010,"This movie is not to be taken at it's face value, that is the evil stuff, special effects and the witches settling down with their respective ,totally different looking kids, and not resembling their biological father Daryl, but more or less with their moms. As many of the reviewers have correctly pointed out, a more competent, thoughtful and mature direction would have turned the movie into a memorable movie, than a forgettable one, and actually flippant , to put it more bluntly.Starting with Jack's seductive best, and isn't he known as the greatest seducer of them all, on an d off screen, it becomes a mockery of his earlier image,of a charming, sexy,witty maverick,into a totally destroyed individual, devoid of his all evil powers, a physical and mental wreck ! This doesn't match with his aggressive persona projected through the pranks he plays ,when his ego is badly bruised by the three women, who have now turned hostile, and want to ruthlessly destroy him, and get rid of him for ever ! Nicholson is truly brilliant,has given a good performance as usual, but perhaps with a better script and stronger direction, and more scope to allow him for delivering his powerful dialogs, it certainly would have matched his role in The Shining, a classic horror movie of all times. The confusion over comedy, horror ,or some thing different, has resulted into robbing the movie of it's excitement, awe, and thrills. We already know that the this guy who came in as a powerful factor in the lives of the three witches,is finally going to lose after all, and this prediction deprives the climax of all the charm.Now about my interpretation behind the apparent plot line of a more-or -less not too ancient tale of some thing unusual happening in a small town; Well, he goes to buy ice cream and stuff like that, doesn't he ? So, according to my some what wild thinking,this is a take on the psyche of women, who are shown ruthless, merciless, determined to take revenge, coming together to achieve that, and not being grateful to what a man has given them; a palacious home, cute kids, wealth, a butler, a dog, and above all, torrid sexual pleasure ! i felt very touched when Daryl tries to communicate with his babies, they,too,gleefully chuckle and respond; and what do these three women do ?Just vanish him with a remote ! Seems to be inspired from Shakesperean dramas, where the women are more evil, and cold-hatred than even men. i normally don't miss this movie, whenever it comes on any channel, specially HBO, and i do it for Nicholson, to see his seduction, his desperation, and his eyes; but end up feeling that some thing is missing. Cher, Susan and Mitchelle, all look good, but don't have much to do. so also about the other supporting cast; i have given seven, as i feel, one should watch it at least once, specially for Nicholson.",The Witches of Eastwick
82,CutUncut2021,Ejectile green vomit,7,31 July 2021,"Once again, John Williams has plagiarised and plundered the classic repertoire, this time it's Janácek's ""Cunning Little Vixen"", some bits almost verbatim. His score for Star Wars was pilfered from Korngold's ""King's Row"" and Williams he'll continue to receive accolades for stealing the deal. These blatant ripoffs aside, the film is a goofy, hilarious piss-take of all things American: rarely does one see so many white blond human beings bonded in the effort to uphold the values of ""love and liberty"". The opening hailstorm says it all: America beware. Despite the stellar cast the real star here is Veronica Cartwright. Watch and re-watch the scene in which her husband Clyde (Jenkins) spoons porridge into her mouth as she raves Salem-style at his incompetence and the doom awaiting Eastwick: ejectile green vomit is imminent... The cello scene between Sarandon and Nicholson is one of the most ridiculous, unbridled and hilarious moments of modern cinema. But the pat concessions toward feminism are belied by the bobbed hair-dos and female tropes restating that female power comes through conforming to male standards. Even witches are victims of the phallocentric myth of femininity. And Nicholson is the perfect distillation of male hubris.

83,ridiculonius,A Fun Tale with one Sexy Devil!,9,21 July 2008,"The first sentence on the back-of-the-box summary for The Witches of Eastwick mentions that the only good choices for playing the Devil would be the Devil himself and Jack Nicholson. That statement holds true right to the end of the film, for I cannot (and I'm sure that most who watched the movie and liked it would agree) imagine anyone else portraying the repulsive and strangely sexy Daryl Van Horne. Susan Sarandon, Cher, and Michelle Pffiefer also give wonderful performances as the three witches of Eastwick, who start out as bored (single) housewives looking for a good man, and end up trying to banish the Devil from their small-town New England home. The three women are Jane (Sarandon), Alex (Cher), and Sukie (Pffiefer), who have radically different personalities and yet are best friends. Jane is shy and klutzy, Alex is artsy and feminist, and Sukie is just a little ball of motherly sweetness. One stormy Thursday night, the three meet for their weekly card games and martinis, and begin to list the things that would compile their perfect prince charming. However, their unconscious sorcery seems to grant their wish; this man on a white horse comes in the form of mysterious New Yorker, Daryl Van Horne, who captivates the town, including our three desperate heroines. For Alex, he appears as a man who can actually keep up with her patronizing and spirited speeches, for Jane, he is a passionate musician who helps her bring out the wildcat within (similar to transformation of her character Janet in The Rocky Horror Picture Show), and for Sukie, he is a tender, gentle man who just wants to cast off his genitalia and become a female. But their new foursome family, bent on having sex at every opportunity and just having a good time, soon encounters some family issues, and it is now up to the witches of Eastwick to banish their mutual lover from their town before he tears it apart. Overall, this was a wonderful movie, full of friendship, laughs, and chills, as well as riveting performances from every actor in it (even the ones with 10 lines).

However, for as much time the movie devouts to monologues about sex and gender, it says nothing of meaning.

As a 2-hour slice of entertainment it serves us OK, especially with some fun visuals and four of the business's best known actors. The problem is that it's an adaptation of a John Updike novel. It's one I haven't read, but knowing some of his other work leads me to believe that there is, or should be, more to this than meets the eye. The ability to vomit prohibitive distances, or for the cello to make such a fiery contribution to seduction, works fine within the context of a Hollywood production. But as an Updike novel? I think not. Take it for what it is - a bit of fun; you'll have the devil of a time looking for hidden meanings and probably finish up spitting cherry stones.",The Witches of Eastwick

They are all widowed or divorced and dream of a tall, dark and handsome foreign prince to come riding on a black horse and sweep them of their feet. What they don't know is they are witches and when they all wish for something together, it is granted. There is some all round good acting. The three leading actresses are amazing as the average single working women who just happen to be witches. The movie manages to give them interesting personalities. Jane in particular has a really comedic character arc.But it is Jack Nicholson who steals every scene he is in. His Daryl van Horne is the devil himself who has come as an answer to the witches' wishes. He is over-the-top, funny and despicable all at the same time. This character is a good addition to his collection crazy-guy roles. The premise is silly and the movie knows it. Hence, it gives us lot of hilariously silly moments. The climax is one good laugh-fest. A good movie to watch if are looking for some light entertainment.",The Witches of Eastwick
88,Diego_rjc,Talk about wasting potential...,4,29 March 2010,"There I was in the video-store a couple of weeks ago. Without nothing better to do, I found 'The Witches of Eastwick' DVD in the Horror section. Originally, I haven't never heard of it. But when I read the informations about the movie, I was completely thrilled by it and my hype went sky- high. I mean, how can a movie directed by George Miller (the 'Mad Max' series), with a score composed by John Williams (the 'Star Wars' series, the 'Indiana Jones series', the 'Superman' series, 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial' and many others) and featuring four of my favorite actors of all time (Jack Nicholson, Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer) could be bad? Well, apparently, this movie succeed into wasting all this potential in a boring and non-sense flick...'The Witches of Eastwick' story is based on a novel by John Updike that tells the story of three single women that live a (very) small New England town called Eastwick. They are Alexandra Medford (Cher), Jane Spofford (Susan Sarandon) and Sukie Ridgemont (Michelle Pfeiffer). The shallowness of their lives is soon to be changed when a new man moves into town. Daryl Van Horne (Jack NIcholson) is exactly what the three of them were waiting. He is filthy rich and wild eyed, and they innocently conjure up to him. But while with him, they discover almighty powers in them selves, finding out that they actually witches and Van Horne is the devil. The plot seems to be kinda nonsense and it is, indeed. And aside from not making sense at all, the movie's screenplay is also badly adapted from Updike's book by Michael Cristofer. This makes the movie worse than it is, because of the horrible development of the story and the completely garbage dialogs. There also some scenes that are unnecessarily disgusting and bad-written. But the script is not all bad. There are a few funny lines, though, and the movie has a surprisingly well-made and fun ending. With a cast like this, you can't help but wait a top-notch overall acting. And that's why I've got completely disappointed by the acting here. It seems like the ensemble just didn't work, and that's a shame. The always-excellent Jack Nicholson delivered a great performance, as usual, with some nice voice and body work. His final speech is something truly amazing. But the rest of the cast simply didn't know what to do. All the supporting cast was bad, specially Veronica Cartwright and Richard Jenkis as two of the city's habitants. And when you though that Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer were going to equal Nicholson's work, they didn't. All the three female stars were bad, specially Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer. Nothing compared to what they did in movies like 'Moonstruck' or 'Scarface'. On the other hand, Susan Sarandon at least tried to deliver a comic performance, but just couldn't. All she did was embarrass herself (and this statement works not just for Sarandon, but for Cher and Pfeiffer also).There's nothing to comment on George Miller's directing work in this picture. It's just another point to be disappointed by - he did nothing special. The special effects were great for 1987, but it's sort of thing that didn't age well. Kids these days would laugh at some scenes. Aside from Nicholson's performance, two other things saved the movie in my opinion. They were the set-decoration, which I really liked, and John Williams's original music score. There are some truly great pieces written for the movie, and some of the tunes don't get out of my head.Overall, 'The Witches of Eastwick' is the movie that wasted most potential in cinema's history. A could've been great flick was transformed into a disappoint because of the horrible acting, writing and directing. If it wasn't for Jack Nicholson's good performance and John Williams' catchy tunes, 'The Witches of Eastwick' would've been a fail in every sense of the word. 4/10",The Witches of Eastwick
89,carlykristen,A Bewitching tale with something for everyone,8,10 October 2006,"This is a genre blending film I found at Fry's Horror section for only  $2.49 retail. It can be described as a supernatural Battle of the Sexes  with horrific, comedic, and dramatic elements with a bizarre love  story/ orgy at the center of it. The 3 ""witches"" (Cher, Susan Sarandon,  and Michelle Pfeiffer) make a request for the perfect man who is  delivered to them in the form of Daryl Van Horne (Jack Nicholson) aka  the Devil.   According to Daryl, when a man is encountered by a strong woman, his  manhood goes limp. The woman is called a ""witch"" and set on fire. This  is used to make women scared of men and scared of themselves. Daryl's  attention allows the 3 women to embrace their sexuality, fertility,  passion, and ambition. Eventually, they realize they no longer need men  for anything, including Daryl. This culminates in the ultimate showdown  with man vs. women.  The SFX quality was good enough to win the BAFTA Award in 1987. The  music by John Williams earned him an Oscar and Grammy nomination.  Nicholson gives an incredibly over the top performance that was good  enough to win both the NY & LA Critics Choice Awards.  There is a lot of back story to this as well. Bill Murray was  originally set to play Darryl and Cher and Sarandon switched roles once  they walked onto the set. The studio execs hassled the director so much  that Miller halted production. When they threatened to replace him with  another director, Nicholson said he would walk away from the  production. This ended the feuding.  Favorite Quote: Almost all the dialogue. Cher asks Nicholson's  character if he is married. To which he responds, "" I don't believe in  it. Good for the man, bad for the woman. She dies, she suffocates. Then  the Husband complains that he is f*cking a dead woman and he is the one  that killed her. Where is your Husband?"" Cher replies, ""Dead.""  DVD Extras: Full Cast & Crew Bios, a set design feature entitled ""  Conjuring Eastwick"", a ""Bewitching Look Back"" at the history, Awards,  Commentary, Interviews, and a Trailer (which indicates there are  deleted scenes missing from the DVD. There should also be the numerous  alternate endings they had shot).  Bottom Line: Bewitching tale (pun intended) with something for  everyone.  Rating: 8.5/10",The Witches of Eastwick
90,sts-26,Proof that the movie need not be faithful to the novel,8,3 June 2009,"With both the novel and the movie so popular, one need not go into great detail regarding the plot, or differences in the story lines. The fact is that both were great works and wonderfully of their time. And those involved in the movie exploited the fact that film is a visual medium, and piled on the styling, adding to Updike's tale and perfectly catching the over-stylized, romantic feel of the mid-to-late eighties. The movie and book are a pairing though, and I believe that one should really not experience one and not the other. Certainly one should not just see the movie, as it does lack the depth and significance of the novel. But then that is usually the case with an adaption.",The Witches of Eastwick

But that's difficult with a great cast, and a lot of entertaining stuff in between. The end in itself was funny, but the quarter of an hour earlier, simply horrible. Badly written, alas.Something to laugh, something to think about, and something to curse: the overall plot could have been closer to John Updike and thereby ended as a great movie: just continuing on the earlier presumption that it was the three ladies who could create what they so longed for. But this is the curse of America, the curse of Hollywood, the sick necessity to have blood, horror, comedy, suspense and blood.

Part romance, part supernatural horror, part feminist message movie, part a lot of things, really, and succeeds at none of them. Nicholson was born to play the devil and he shouts and spits and smirks something fierce.

Love John Williams and Jack Nicolson and it seemed like a more adult 1980's Hocus Pocus.Or a fun comedy horror about subverting an uptight town with witchcraft.Well, this ain't Hocus Pocus.I'm not entirely sure what it is.It's way way way over the top, ""abrasive"" as one reviewer put it.It's sometimes a dark comedy, although I didn't laugh. It has elements of the theme of friendship and sisterhood, which is forgotten and resumed awkwardly. There are elements of even body horror. I didn't expect puking up cherry pits violently to happen more than once in any stretch of the imagination.I'm not the type to be offended by older movies that don't fit modern pc standards, but my Lord, this movie teaches women are easily seduced and use sex to get what they want.What bothered me more was that there was a sense that these women were going to be truly empowered in their lives. But it didn't really happen. Yet another set up let down. Or the script just going in awkward directions.I didn't understand how I was supposed to feel about the woman prophesizing. She was just going crazy and then gets killed suddenly. And then the whole thing with her and her husband is just dropped.Lastly, I was expecting crazy witchey stuff.But that didn't happen.

The cast is basic perfection and they are accompanied by an amazing score, courtesy of John Willians, and story based upon the book by John Updike. This has got to bee one of the best pieces of witch media in cinema.The plot follows three lonely women in a suburban town whom soon met a mysterious and devilish man whom it's exactly who he seems to be. As the film goes on, the mystery of whether Jack Nicholson is the devil or not becomes more and more apparent and the Witches start to realise how dangerous he truly.I also love that while this film maybe categorised as a feminist film however Jack Nicholson isn't the antagonist because he's a male, he's the antagonist because he's the devil and wicked. This is exactly how female centric films should be towards men, some are true antagonists and the others are protagonists. This sis exactly what the woke media of today gets wrong as female centric movies are made however every man in said movie is either completely stupid and a complete pig and it's somehow surprising when the film is labelled as sexist and dumb.In short, this film is amazing because of it's actors and their ability. The incredible story and score. It also should be a note taker for future female-centric directors however because of its underration that will never happen.",The Witches of Eastwick
102,MichelleAudrey,An oldie but a goodie!,8,25 November 2011,"Perhaps one of the most admirable feats in life is to show how far one has come through hard work and change. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once put it, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Director, George Miller, is an example of such, as he went on to direct The Witches of Eastwick merely two years after the last installment of the Mad Max movies, a trilogy that was his own creation and quite frankly, one of the most inane contributions to cinema in the last 30 years. Adapted from the novel by John Updike, The Witches of Eastwick concerns a female trio who have been abandoned by their husbands and upon meeting Daryl Van Horne, a mysterious newcomer in their sleepy town of Eastwick, they discover they have magical abilities. Van Horne is quite clearly an incarnation of Satan from the outset, seeking to corrupt the women and ultimately control/destroy the world once he gets some action from the hypnotic trio of course.The film is well paced, particularly at the beginning. Nicholson, although a stereotype for this kind of role, is a perfect fit as Van Horne and the scene where he appears snoring his head off in the back row of Jane's music recital (played by a rather young Susan Sarandon),encapsulates the tone for the entire film. The chemistry between the actors is, in no small way, responsible for the mischievous and entertaining air throughout. Pfeiffer, Cher and Sarandon are quite believable as a group of friends who get together to eat, drink and commiserate about the men in their lives and subsequently, as a coven who attempt to overthrow the power of Satan in typical 80′s comedic fashion. If we're going to be really critical here, the film falls down somewhat in its portrayal of the trio as strong, independent women as they are nothing of the sort until the very end of the film. The only impetus for the women to go the extra mile and indulge in their wiccan powers, is through the introduction of an all-powerful male figure who uses up each woman and causes them explicit (but hilarious!) pain. Van Horne's power is ultimately subverted as he is conjured up by the women themselves and as the women discover, he can be made to disappear by them also.Let's not get too caught up in technicalities with this film, it doesn't try to be something it isn't although it varies considerably from Updike's novel. The last section of the film has been widely criticised for spiraling into ridiculousness, a criticism that is quite valid as it lends a monotonous tone to the ending in comparison to the light-hearted, magical atmosphere of the earlier parts. Overdone and overbaked at the end, it's an unfortunate notion that not even Nicholson's comic talents are able to save the climax from losing its momentum. Despite this, the film is very watchable owing to the high standards of acting turned in all round, in particular by Nicholson and Veronica Cartwright (playing a Christian wife of Eastwick's newspaper editor in a scene-stealing supporting role). Overall, an entertaining romp that knows how to churn out the laughs. 7/10.All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2011 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása).",The Witches of Eastwick

Nicholson has made a raft of poor films offset by some of the finest performances of any actor. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets outweigh any number of duds.

The only thing I understood then was that there was a devil that came to Eastwick.Seeing the movie again last night was so awesome. Jack Nicholson who is one of my favorite actors gave a stellar performance as the Devil. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good laugh. My favorite scene is the one where Jack Nicholson goes in front of the Church and also the confrontation he has with Cher's character. I must have rewound those scenes 8 times in a row last night.Enjoy!",The Witches of Eastwick

Never gonna watch this one again.

117,fiameza,A classic we all love.,8,9 May 2006,"I just re watched this film and fell in love with it all over again. I guess its the cast of Michelle Pfeiffer, Cher, and Susan Sarandon, and Jack Nicholson. This movie is funny, crazy, silly, sexy, and just plain great entertainment. It should teach all men not to cross a woman cause you just may not know when you're dealing with a witch. When powerful women get together things happen and men beware. This film shows these women in their normal lives and then when they get together the powers unfold. So fun to watch things happening to Jack Nicholson....his acting is brilliant as usual. The chemistry of this cast works great and I love the personalities.",The Witches of Eastwick
118,dhoffman-3,The only movie I ever walked out of...,2,18 January 2001,"Jack Nicholson is one of the few sure bets in film, but boy did this movie stink.  With this cast I expected so much more.

119,basehex-1,dam* near perfect movie,10,1 April 2007,"This is one of those dam* perfect movies, which means that it does everything it wants to do perfectly. It's not Gandhi. It's a small wonderful movie with terrific actors at their insane best having monstrous fun. Sarandon, pinched up constricted small town music teacher turned libertine: 'OK, get rid of your musicall of itNow on 4 we're going to play the sh*t of this piece'. Char, Pfeiffer, Veronica Cartwright  brilliant moment after brilliant moment  Nicholson above all, with every look on his face. His speech in church at movie's end: 'WOMENWAS IT AN ACCIDENT? or DID GOD DO IT TO US ON PURPOSE?' Incredible, totally amazing incredible speech. It should be a classic. The whole movie should be a classic for what it is, an absolutely brilliant small movie.Notes:#1 I haven't parsed 'Witches' out scene by scene, but I almost suspect every shot could be perfect. Absolutely nothing wasted, stuffed King Kong - then three boys in the bath. But like any small perfect movie, it's absolutely essential to watch this as in a movie theater, in a dark room, most of the lights out, preferably at night. #2 Screw Douglas in 'Wall Street'  Nicholson should have won best actor for this, and he wasn't even nominated.",The Witches of Eastwick

121,dluber1,Underrated Gem,8,8 March 2007,"I liked this movie more on repeated viewings, when I began noticing subtleties that I had missed the first time. It's an understated adaptation, certainly reading the book would help but I think it tells the story quite well on its own, and it's full of clever touches that the second and third time around made me smile and think ""that's just perfect"", with lots of dry humor scattered throughout. I disagree with the comment about it being a ""hash"". Being about the power of the unconscious and supernatural (or more precisely the primal power of nature, specifically feminine power and nature) it works well as a mood piece, and the sparse plotting leaves the viewer who is open to it to join the three women on their inner voyage of discovery. For example, they were all shocked and frightened (as we were) at the earth cracking under their feet during their argument. The conclusion is subtle but powerful; male and female forces in a fragile balance, with the women really in charge.",The Witches of Eastwick

123,btbshining,Disappointing,6,17 September 2001,"I just watched this film again on video the other day, and it really is a mess, with a plot so weak it's All Star cast can't even save it!The film was a box office hit, and I saw it a while back in my younger days, but I remember being a bit puzzled by the story. Now I know why, as the films terrible editing has left the plot in pieces. I understand Studio Executive's forced plot changes, to show off the then new special effects, and the disorder sure shows.Maybe Director George Miller can do a new Director's Cut for DVD, as this film sure can use improvement. I hate to see such a good cast and director wasted in this sad version.",The Witches of Eastwick
124,ashley4894,excellent,10,29 March 2007,This movie was fantastic it couldn't have been better. They all four looked their best Jack Nicholson looked really young and great he fit this part fantastic of course he always does and susan sarandon looked great she was pretty and she pulled this part off she was great and cher was really good she was pretty and she pulled it off to. Michelle Pfeifer did it great she's pretty their all pretty no one could have done it better than them. I thought he looked good with susan sarandon the best. And i loved the part where they were doing voodoo on him and he went into the church and threw up cherries hilarious. But at he end they shouldn't have gotten rid of him but the movie was fantastic over all.,The Witches of Eastwick
125,endicottcoolmoss,"""Who are you really?"" ""Anybody you want me to be!""",10,6 June 2005,"This is some of the greatest writing (lines), directing and editing I've seen in any movie. This masterpiece showcased Jack, Cher, Michele and Susan in an elaborate display of their unique ability. It would be interesting and probably rewarding to witness a platform that would compliment these four actors as well as this collaborative effort does. It would be a tough act to follow. ""We don't deal the deck down here, we just play the percentages."" I enjoy great lines and great scenes. If the Academy would dissect movies into categories including, best lines, best scenes, etc.; this movie could be nominated as could movies such as True Romance, Pulp Fiction and The Professional (Leon).",The Witches of Eastwick

127,avi_p99-1,Not really the camp 80's film it's marketed as...,6,31 May 2007,"In the small American town of Eastwick, where Christian values of morality and family life serve as the law, strange and violent events begin to occur with the arrival of a new, big city, millionaire charmer by the name of Darrell Van Horn (Nicholson). His entrance is seemingly brought on by the wish of three single women, who are supposedly Witches (played by Cher, Pfeiffer and Sarandon), who can make anything happen by wishing it at the same time. Soon we see Van Horn seducing and having a polygamous relationship with the three witches, which leads to happiness, laughter and disaster. Who exactly is this Van Horn character and is this the beginning of a new era in family values? Like its other 80's contemporaries, such as Working Girl and Fatal Attraction, The Witches of Eastwick doubles as a social commentary on the state of women in a male dominated society, as well as a simple point A to point B story. Here, the focus is on the new breed of middle aged single women, who can be mothers and career women and still have time for a cocktail at the end of the day, without the need for a providing husband.While the film does work as a thought inducing critique on the perception of modern women and the men who have always tried to exploit them, as a whole, it lacks focus. At various points it tries to be a thriller, a satire and a serious look at modern America, but director George Miller never really manages to blend these different tones into one cohesive whole. As a result, the film seems a little confused. On the plus side though the whole cast give fantastic performances, especially Nicholson and Sarandon, who clearly seem to be having more fun playing their mischievous roles than others and the film does have quite a few dark ""laugh out loud"" moments.For those of you looking for a fun, camp eighties movie, it might be a better idea for you to revisit Working Girl or Overboard, since you will clearly be disappointed by this picture. Fans of Nicholson and ""Gurrrl Power""(in it's most radical sense) should definitely check this one out.",The Witches of Eastwick
128,mimiwritesbooks,"An Age-Old, Yet Timely Message",8,11 June 2018,"This movie is like many have already stated - a statement regarding a woman's sexual awakening. However, it also speaks to the timely subject of misogyny and how one may allow themselves to be ""talked"" into having relations even when they weren't originally attracted to the individual. I thought the moment when Daryl puts his arm around Sookie and she cringes, yet GOES WITH HIM, was very poignant and well done. When the women decide to reject his advances and don't want anything more to do with him, they're punished. Then they are left to extreme measures in order to get rid of him.Tell me that isn't the story of any woman who had a lover they couldn't get rid of!Meanwhile, Felicia is the only one who can see what is going on. She, too, is punished for speaking the truth. A ""witch"" in her own right, she predicts the things to come and no one wants to hear her.",The Witches of Eastwick
