0,nairtejas,One-Line Review: Simmba (2 Stars),2,25 March 2019,"Rohit Shetty's Simmba is made to appeal to the masses - with an overacting, highly energetic, and corrupt cop (Ranveer Singh) who comes to his senses after a tragedy and pulls up his socks to right his wrongs - using the most absurd narrative for a film you have seen since Golmaal Again (2017) but you already knew that. TN.",Simmba
1,SAMTHEBESTEST,SIMMBA ROARS ENOUGH FOR A SUPER HIT,7,28 December 2018,"SIMMBA REVIEW :Simmba might be remembered for the Best Ever Surprising Cameos in any Rohit Shetty Film. As promised it is a Perfect Mixture of Comedy, Romance, Emotions, Hit Songs, Mass Elements and true Blockbuster cameos by Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar. Ranveer Singh makes a Solid entry in Mass genre while Rohit manages to keep his standard on his own level. Along with the wholesome Entertainment package Simmba also tries to spread awareness on Sensitive topic like Rape cases happening in our nation giving the reference of Nirbhaya Incident.Simmba is a Story of an Orphanage child who becomes a Cop, Sangram Bhalerao (Ranveer Singh) and he is dishonest to his Uniform, his job but loyal toward money and extortion. How he faces some painful incidents and that turns him into an Honest Cop, this entire journey is presented in Entertaining way. Ranveer does so much Overacting (Writing Mistake) in 1st half, the kiddish accent, the sloppy english he speaks might irritate you on alternate occassions. Then we see real Actor Ranveer in 2nd half, you see that anger, you feel the Rowdyness and you clap on his Dhaasu Dialogues plus machoism. Sara Ali Khan looks beautiful but has got very limited screenspace. Supporting cast includes Siddharth Jadhav, Ashutosh Rana, Vaidehi Parshurami, Neha Mahajan and many more marathi artists, is Fab. In negative roles Sonu Sood, Saurabh Gokhale are impressive. The best thing about Simmba is it's Script, why? Because it never goes illogical, it is sticked to the Logic, it is sticked to the Reality. The problem appears in Screenplay which is extra Lengthy, especially in 1st half, it could have been much more engaging or we can blame editing to the some extent for the same. Music is Amazing, all 3 hit songs 'Aankh Marey', 'Tere Bin' and 'Simmba' comes in the 1st half only to make the lengthy 1st energetic and then 'Mera Wala Dance' is End Credits song. Cinematography is good, action sequences are massy, punchlines have humour as well as slapstick one liners. Director Rohit Shetty has done what he is doing since years, he might have not hit the high level bar but he doesnt go too down either.Overall, Simmba is a Good Entertainment Package to buy in festive weekend for the families. It had the chance to go to Singham Level (High Repeat Value and No Loo Breaks) but misses due to Screenplay and controlled vision of Director. Still, it is 2nd Best film after Singham of Rohit Shetty in Action genre, hence better than Singham Returns. It might have ended as an Average affair but the Trick of cameos by Rohit Shetty has worked big time. The way Ajay Devgn sets the screen on fire and Akshay Kumar surprises at the end, both the things uplifts the tempo in the 2nd half to End Simmba on a Very Good note and that makes you leave the auditorium with sufficient happiness. As far as Box Office is concerned, there should be no stopping in the Extended Weekend for Simmba and it will surely emerge 2nd or 3rd Biggest Grosser of Ranveer Singh. In the Sense, this is 6/10* film but i am adding 1* extra for the Dhamakedaar Cameos l, therefore 7/10* Go For it....",Simmba
2,Fella_shibby,"How, this far into the 21st century, does a film like this get made? Lots of overacting.",1,30 October 2019,"My original review which got more than 300 likes got deleted cos the fellas associated with this lousy film cannot digest opinions. IMDb is flooded with fanboys of lousy actors who cannot respect opinions.I never put spoilers, or abusive or irrelevant stuff.
This proves that IMDb of lately been hijacked by fake reviews.I can still copy paste my review which is saved but this time I jus want to write something different.
As a fan of Ajay Devgan, I am really shocked that he agreed to star in this pathetic film.
The overacting by the lead actor became an enduring torture to sit thru.
The script, direction, acting, editing n cinematography, r all worse than Ed Wood films.Massive narrative sinkholes, outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly pathetic over acting. This film is a torture to sit thru n without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made.",Simmba
3,sauravjoshi85,A typical Bollywood masala flick,6,29 December 2019,"Simmons is an action comedy movie directed by Rohit Shetty and stars Ranveer Singh, Sonu Sood, Ashutosh Rana and Sara Ali Khan in the leads.The plot of the movie is very predictable which tells the story of a corrupt police officer whose life changes 360 degree when he came across a life changing incident BUT the beauty of Rohit Shetty is that he knows the quality of making a simple plot into watchable and somewhat enjoyable. He knows the nerves of Indian Audience and delivers as per their liking and expectations.The acting of Ranveer Singh is okay and looks like he is doing overacting in some scenes. Sara Ali Khan is just for couple of songs and hasn't got much screen space. Sonu Sood is average in the role of a powerful gangster and he had done this type of roles in movies like Dabang and R. Rajkumar and there is nothing new this time also, Ashutosh Rana came on silver screen after a long time and impresses, he is a powerhouse of talent and could have been utilised much better. Rest cast is does a satisfactory job.The only thing which you will miss in the movie is typical Rohit Shetty stunts where the cars and villains fly in the air.Overall an enjoyable movie which will keep a smile on your face in first half and has some good emotional scenes in second halfThe climax awaits dual bonus for typical Rohit Shetty fans.",Simmba
4,Takethispunch,Hohoho. What a piece of regressive trash. Carry on bhakts.,1,2 January 2019,"What were the makers n star cast thinking man. Were they high on Datura or do they take the Indian audiences as foolish n dumb folks.
Awful script n tons of overacting by the lead actor.",Simmba
5,ketgup83,Ranveer Singh is electrifying and shines through out in this mediocre drama,6,30 December 2018,"Simmba was a masala popcorn entertainment which had Ranveer Singh written all over it.Simmba (Ranveer Singh) has been transferred to Goa and is happily settled. Things turns topsy-turvy when he steps into the way of Durva Ranade (Sonu Sood). What follows next is cold war between the two and how they fight for the survival.When you hear that Rohit Shetty has directed a film, of course you do not expect logic in his movies, forget about the content. I had kept my expectations low and went to see the film only for Ranveer Singh, after he impressed me as Alauddin Khilji in Padmaavat. These kind of cinemas generally does not have moral story and sense but they do have section of audience who loves to whistle to introduction scene of their hero, clap to the item songs and shout as their hero punches the villain.Surprisingly Rohit Shetty does a decent job in keeping you entertained but falls flat when it comes to story , screenplay and most importantly direction. Unnecessary inclusion of songs , less-impacting climax scene will make you gorge for more. The cinematography is excellent. Art direction is eye-catching. Background score relishes with the film. Action scenes are larger than life (as expected). Music by Amar Mohile and S. Thaman is good where they have recreated the ""Aankh Maare"" song from the 90's hit film, Tere Mere Sapne.Coming to performances, it is Ranveer Singh who gives in a knock-out performance with his quick-witted one liners, charming attitude , romantic avatar , shows off his well-sculpted torso without inhibitions. If you have loved the character of Alauddin Khilji in Padmaavat , you will adore him in Simmba. He is simply outstanding. Sara Ali Khan is passable. Ashutosh Rana surprises you. Cameo by Ajay Devgan is mindblowing.Simmba had potential to make it big but was saddened by weak direction. However, one makes who makes sure you sit right through the film is Ranveer Singh. He is surely a talent to watch for. Decent 2.75/5",Simmba
6,MuviFan73,Faith in Rohit Shetty movie restored!,7,29 December 2018,"Throughout the years a Rohit Shetty movie for me taking into consideration of whatever I have watched, it has been never been why did I watch it. My first decision if to watch a movie comes from trailer followed by IMDb ratings and other few factors. On the first day more than 60% rated the movie 1/10 on IMDb. Considering the director and first time a KRK review I went to see this movie and I was contented.The movie is how a rapist should be dealt with. The fate of such people (as shown) should be recorded and made viral. The people should fear before doing such a heinous crime.Major audience on IMDb belong the male members. Over that such a rating of major votes is worrisome.",Simmba
7,beevenkat,"#ranveersingh is king, not content",5,8 January 2020,"U will certainly forget the phrase 'content is king', when u watch #simmba. Here, #ranveersingh is king, not content. Hes excellent in a film which isnt. He kicks, he punches, he romances, he dances, he emotes. He does everything to enthrall u. The heroine doesnt do much, as per instructions given to her. The villain n his brothers do a lot of bad stuff, as expected. Womens safety, street kids education n mens upbringing r also discussed, so that u dont feel cheated. Rating 2.5/5.",Simmba
8,jetkot,Ranveer .has star power,10,24 April 2019,"The actor makes me smile in every frame. He does well in comedy, action, drama or even playing a character with grey shades. Simmba is not your friendly neighbourhood Robinhood at first but he has a change of heart. Rohit Shetty does not abide to the rules of the purists or the critics. He makes entertaining movies with flying cars and catchy action scenes. This film establishes the cop universe of Rohit shetty that started with Singham and will be followed by Suryavanshi with Akshay Kumar. This is bollywood masala entertainment. If you do not like spicy masala entertainment then skip it and watch more meaningful cinema",Simmba
9,Magow-Intermean,Simmba Review 💯🇮🇳 Review,9,19 January 2019,"""Mind is blowing,"" thunders Simmba whenever something makes him happy. And nothing makes him happier than money. His mantra in life is to do beimaani with full imaandaari. Ranveer Singh as the corrupt police officer is in top form in this massy entertainer. Right from the first scene he captivates your senses with his disarming charm, even when he's not doing the right thing. Ranveer lives the character of Simmba with zest and aplomb, aided by massy wisecracks in an endearing Marathi accent that will make you chuckle. But as the film gets progressively serious, his easy banter turns into tough talk for the bad guys, topped with solid action and emotion. Whether it's the funny first half or the grim second half, Ranveer packs quite a punch.
His leading lady Sara Ali Khan, however, has precious little to do besides looking breathtakingly beautiful. The chemistry between Simmba and Shagun (Sara) isn't particularly crackling and their meet-cute scenes seem more contrived than convincing. Instead, what comes off as more natural is Simmba's connect with character artistes, with whom he forges familial ties.
But that and everything else happens in trademark Rohit Shetty style. This is his brand of cinema, where the hero has a larger-than-life swag, but is also relatable to the common man. There are the usual caricature bechara baaps,betis and behenas, convoys of endless SUVs speeding across Goa and burly bad men. There is also a dashing villain, who has the local police and politicos in his pocket. A dapper Sonu Sood fits the bill as Durva Ranade as a family man on the wrong side of the law. He ably depicts the conflict of a man who has to protect his own, despite their misdeeds.
Amidst all this, the film delivers what it sets out to do - give us full on masala entertainment along with seeti-inducing scenes.For example, you cannot help but feel a sense of pride when Ranveer stands tall in a tight fitting khakhi and his otherwise critical subordinate Ashutosh Rana finally salutes him. All the same, you will also feel the unease at the over dramatic portrayal of so many character artists as caricatures.
In the second half, however, the film also turns into a preachy discourse on safety of women and a campaign against sexual predators in our society. The narrative is predictable and there is hardly an element of surprise.
In music, 'Aankh Maare' stands out for its high energy beat and so does the romantic track 'Tere Bin' for its melody and exotic picturisation.But overall, Simmba is a potboiler that you expect it to be, where the good surely outweighs the bad. There are enough paisa vasool moments including the cameo by the original Singham, Ajay Devgn. And it doesn't end there. Shetty leaves you with a parting shot of another superstar already revealing the first look of his offering in 2019.",Simmba
10,Li_85,Honest Review from Movie Expert,5,30 December 2018,"I have seen the original Teluga version ""Temper"" and was excited to see the hindi remake. I love Rohit Shetty and Ranveer Singh and looking forward to Sara Ali khan.Good Direction, Good Acting by Ranveer, Ashutosh Rana, Sonu Sood, Sara was OK, its a small role to be fair on her.But, The original Temper was much more Better, This was a oppurtunity to make the movie better. The original Temper, NTR Jnr was Fantastic. The story was much more gripping and tense. NTR helps the bad guys escape jail, works for them without knowing what they did, The character vuild up was much more better in Temper.
Spoilers - The poor girl gets raped in Simmba. But in Temper, The poor girl gets kidnapped, raped repeatedly, held captive for 40 days, Tortured, burnt, acid, whipped, beaten. Brutalized and humiliated as they film this and make a dvd.
Its much more horrific and you feel for the girl much more and hate the bad guys much more, Temper ending was fantastic, they got a good death, Simmba was very simple death. They triied to copy another famous south indian blockbuster (Theri)
Overall, i am dissapointed with SImmba.",Simmba
11,msunando,A grim social message in the garb of a comedy,6,30 December 2018,"Simmba - lay down the red carpet for Inspector Sangram Bhalerao alias Simmba, a corrupt and unethical policeman in Goa whose only aim in life is to make money. He is an orphan, has no relatives and therefore, doesn't value any relationships too, until the rape and murder of a young girl serves as a rude awakening of his conscience. Jolted out of his narcissistic stupor, Simmba will go any length to bring the perpetrators to punishment and will use the weak links of the law to his advantage.Ranveer Singh checks all the boxes in his over the top avatar - he romances, dances, fights, does comedy and delivers his dialogues in a typical coastal accent like a master. He is ably supported by Ashutosh Rana, Sonu Sood and the usual battery of Rohit Shetty production characters in this year's last release. Simmba is a mainstream potboiler with all the modern gimmicks a la Rohit Shetty ishtyle. Sara Ali Khan has a little role but adds freshness.The movie is topical and at one point of time underscores the grim official statistics of rapes in India that serves as the backdrop and justification to the mode of justice meted out. The climax is engrossing with a number of surprises that I shall keep in the box right now - go and check it out yourself. The customary drumroll when Simmba walks with a swagger is energetic with a feel good factor. Enjoy this outrageous commercial venture and leave behind your brains - gawk at the brawn instead. I rate it 6 STARS.",Simmba
12,rish2006,Parody of Temper,1,13 July 2021,CopyWood will always continue their copying of south movies. The disappointment is that Rohit Shetty didn't make a proper remake of Temper but made a complete parody of temper with lame humor and terrible acting.Other people praising this movie have not seen Temper. Those who have seen temper will clearly find this Simba movie - A piece of s#!t.,Simmba
13,nnk-39990,Typical masala movie !,7,28 December 2018,"Best movie of the year when it comes to Masala entertainment , paisa vasool movie . Ranveer nails it and so does Sara",Simmba
14,GirishGowda,"Headache inducing low standard mess, especially when there is a magnum opus KGF standing against it.",1,28 December 2018,"At a time when there is a magnum opus like KGF: Chapter 1 (which is terrific even in Hindi) and have plenty of good content and entertaining movies in 2018 comes along Simmba, Pummba and Timmba which is slap across the face to every Indian who pays to see this movie. The critics have been bribed (as always) to laud this mess of a movie. Ranveer Singh (whom I like as an actor) overacts to no end. Sara Ali Khan is a classic example of a talentless hack making it big only because of Bollywood's penchant for nepotism. Rohith Shetty should retire already if he's not going to go above remaking South Indian movies and making them worse.",Simmba
15,achyutaghosh,fun while it lasts,6,6 January 2019,"Simmba's plot can be summed up in one line. It is the story of Sangram Bhalerao- a corrupt cop who transforms into a good cop once his loved ones are wronged. If the first half of the movie establishes Ranveer Singh's Simmba as gleefully amoral, the second half suddenly does the switch over to ""Singham"" mode. More on that later but as a viewer you tend to ask questions like why the sudden switch? Why has it not happened before? Didn't Simmba find a cause earlier? And also, can a cop be judge, jury and executioner all in one overnight?But then Simmba is a Rohit Shetty production which means it is out and out a masala movie, you leave your thinking out of the hall, and try to get entertained in his over the top way. Simmba is as formulaic as ever- bright colors, forced emotions, shoddy sets, literally ""slap-stick scenes"", caricatured female characters, and illogical slow motion action is there as expected. Rohit Shetty's first attempt in his career at any form of character development is as simple as an on-off switch, and do spare a thought for Sara Ali Khan's thankless lead actress role which is no more than a cameo. However the script is funny in the first half and addresses an issue of national disgrace in the second half relatively well. Ranveer's high energy, Sonu Sood's menacing turn and Ashutosh Rana's emotiveness further elevates Simmba to a few notches above an average Rohit Shetty flick.Simmba further cements Rohit Shetty's position as the premier masala movie maker in Bollywood and he is on to something here. He is trying to build a money spinning Fast and Furious type franchise out of Bollywood. His formula is about economizing on what his audience does not want, and maximizing what they want. So in come moderately differentiated action stars, rollicking action sequences, music remakes, exotically pictured songs for marketing promos, and let the concoction roll. Simmba is a spin off from Shetty's Singham and features Ajay Devgn in the titular role as well. As the last scene indicates, another spin off is on the cards- Veer Sooryavanshi, which will star Akshay Kumar. India's Hobbs and Shaw will be here before Hollywood's Hobbs and Shaw I think, and I am really excited to see whether Shetty has it in him to make something more unforgettable that his usual fare.Simmba is fun while it lasts. 6/10",Simmba
16,mohit_sinsniwal,"great movie , must watch one time and full of entertainment",7,26 May 2019,"Cudnt digest my opinion.Majority of the reviewers who've given a 10/10 rating have hardly ever written other reviews - that goes to show the credibility of their film-watching experience and taste and perhaps their motive. Their IDs r created few days within the film's release. They r the paid servants/staff of the producers n actor.I am a big fan of Ajay Devgan but it is sad to see him in this kinda trash. I saw this alone in a theatre wher the tickets werent high priced. The audiences' reaction were full of anger n frustration but I was laughing cos the producers, the director n actor managed to fool the audiences into selling this horrible piece of film as entertainment. Someone rightly said in the review section that this aint no entertainment but an abomination. Tired of the same ol awful action sequences. Tired of the same ol awful script. Tired of Ranvir's overacting man. High time they shud stop telling us to keep our brains at home. The lead character does all kinds shady stuff (must have involved female subjugation). One fine day he turns into a saviour aft his sis gets sexually assaulted. Hohoho.Ranvir n his paid bhakts till now has managed to get deleted all negative reviews including mine which got more than 500 likes. They r busy pumping fake reviews of 10/10 that too by fake IDs created jus a week ago. It's so obvious man.Yeehaw! So happy that a small time fella/reviewer like me has shaken Ranvir n his paid bhakts.",Simmba

18,fillerruth,"This melodramatic, over-the-top film is sure to leave you on a high.",5,28 December 2018,"A solid, well-packaged entertainer with a powerful message... Rohit Shetty gets it right yet again... And so does Ranveer, who is outstanding... Whistles, claps, laughter assured... Expect a STORM at the BO.On the whole, SIMMBA is a sure-shot winner, no two opinions about it. This one will storm the boxoffice. 2018 is sure to conclude with a roar!Amidst all this, film delivers what it sets out to do - give us full on masala entertainment along with seeti-inducing scenes. But overall, Simmba is a potboiler that you expect it to be, where the good surely outweighs the bad. There are enough paisa vasool moments including the cameo by the original Singham, Ajay Devgn. And it doesn't end there. Shetty leaves you with a parting shot of another superstar already revealing the first look of his offering in 2019.Shetty navigates a familiar ground here in this formula film mounted on a franchise that has proven its worth in box office gains. It's not a film that will encourage one to rethink fundamental theories or alter societal thought, even though it aspires to be at one point. But it's surely a masala entertainer that packs in laughs, drama, dishooms and a lot more - now that's more than you can expect for a multiplex ticket.How Inspector Bhalerao turns from a corrupt officer with a heart of gold into an avenger who goes after the men who have dared to lay a hand on his 'sister' forms the crux of the plot.Ranveer Singh proves a complete package. Rohit Shetty does not veer from his super successful tried and tested formula in Simmba - there is enough action, comedy, drama and foot-tapping music and dance to keep even the thought of a yawn at bay. If you are on the lookout for a totally masala, paisa vasool movie to end the year with a bang, we recommend you watch Simmba. The melodramatic, over-the-top film is sure to leave you on a high.",Simmba
19,IAmTheShyGuy,A masala potboiler!,8,26 January 2019,"Ranveer Singh as Simmba has totally rocked this movie with his amazing performance & his brilliant antics! The first 30 mins of the movie will make you laugh like hell! The first half shows the funny side of Simmba whereas the second half shows his rough side & raging anger! Sara Ali Khan looks really beautiful and compliments her role well as Simmba's lady love. The music of the movie, especially the theme music, which will keep ringing in your ears, is another thing to watch out for. The foot-tapping remix of ""Aankh Maare"" is sure to have you glued to the screen! Although the movie scores well in all things, there is one major flaw in the movie - The usage of Marathi by Goan police & so many policemen with Marathi surnames and almost everyone from the Court Judge to the local goons speaking in Marathi which is so absurd! Though the story is based in Goa, there's not even a hint of Konkani! Irrespective of the fact that it's a Hindi movie, or that it's a Goa-Maharashtra border! Apart from this, the movie is a great watch with a nice social message.",Simmba
20,prafullasrivastav,Full of entertainment and paisa vasool cinema from Rohit and Ranveer.,7,5 January 2019,"Direction: Rohit Shetty is famous for making successful remake from South Indian movie. Simmba is remake of Jr. NTR's Temper. However this is really entertaining remake as Rohit Shetty's production house started working as Hollywood's Marvel studios with crossover of star-cast from another movie or another franchise. Inclusion of Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Golmaal's team was really brilliant step and hint for new sequels.Performance: Ranveer Singh is full package of entertainment with great energy. Sara Ali did not get much window but she looks cute in her role of Shagun. This movie will remember for great supporting roles from Ashutosh Rana and Siddhartha Jadhav. Sonu Sood looks good in negative role.Script: This movie deals with rape issues across nation. Although subject-line is quite old and many film makers have made lots of movies on this topic. Rohit has gave different treatment to the script. First half dedicated to fun ride with entertaining Simmba and second half, full of emotion and action sequences. Plot is quite predictable but it is worth watching.Dialogue: There are many good dialogues which are important ingredient for masala cinema.e.g. ""Tell me what i don't know"". However some punch is missing in the dialogue which we have seen in Singham.Music: This department was good, not better than Singham. Reprised from Tanishk Bagchi e.g. Ankh Mare and Tere Bina were good.Background score was really impressive especially when Singham join Simmba, combo pack of background score was awesome.Box-Office: So far movie have earned 159 crores in 8 days so 250 crores is on cards for lifetime collection. At least ShahRukh Khan say thanks to Rohit for not clashing this movie with Zero otherwise Ranveer Singh has repeat history clash of Dilwale & Bajirao Mastani.Last Words: If you to end 2018 with happy notes, just go and watch Simmba in cinema hall.",Simmba

27,rahuljonathan-nair,A typical Rohit Shetty Film with masala entertainment at it's best!!,8,5 January 2019,"A typical potboiler film with masala entertainment at its best, which is Rohit Shetty's ishtyle!! Whenever a film is helmed by Rohit Shetty, audiences can expect without a doubt that it would contain all those elements which is Rohit Shetty's formula for every film, i.e. action, comedy, drama and romance!! And ""Simmba"" manages to deliver on all these aspects!!It wouldn't be wrong to say that Rohit Shetty likes to make films which are of his ""comfort zone"" as his objective is to make films with classic entertainment which doesn't require much thinking per se. But the main factor is how he manages to tackle every film of his with all these same elements and still emerges to deliver pure unadulterated entertainment!! That is his biggest strength and no one can doubt that!!He is the only or one of the few filmmakers who goes with the ""tried-and-tested"" formula with his films, yet never failing on that for which he deserves all the success coming its way!!Sure, the plot is nothing unique or novel as it's the story of a corrupt cop who tries to mend his ways after an unfortunate incident takes place which shakes him!! If you would have seen the trailer, then it wouldn't be wrong to say that much of the story is within the trailer itself. But what makes it engaging despite its flaws is all those elements (mentioned above) which are put through by the wonderful performances of the star cast.Ranveer Singh manages to deliver another power-packed performance after giving a ""dark and intense"" performance in ""Padmaavat"". He manages to carry the film on his shoulders and he deserves all the success!!Sara Ali Khan is beautiful and attractive, no two opinions on that and acts decently.Sonu Sood as the ""antagonist"" is another force to reckon with!! He manages to give a great performance nonetheless!!But, it would be safe to say that everyone would go beserk from the moment when ""Ajay Devgan"" would appear on the screen!! His screen-time would bring all the whistles and claps and would make everyone happy!!Added to that is the cameo with another superstar whose name begins with the same alphabet ""A"" i.e. ""Akshay Kumar"". One couldn't miss his appearance for sure and audiences are sure to be in a treat after watching him, there's something special.Music is good especially songs like ""Aankh Marey"" and ""Tere Bin"". Action is pure Rohit Shetty's level!! Screenplay could have been tighter!! First half was predictable, but second half manages to raise the film with a good amount of quotient!!Overall, ""Simmba"" delivers pure unadulterated entertainment in a typical Rohit Shetty's formula!! A good entertaining film which manages to end the year ""2018"" on a high note!! Good effort by the whole team!!",Simmba
28,rohitreviews,Very disappointing movie.,4,16 January 2019,"Considering I watched Temper movie of Jnr NTR, comparatively the story of Simmba is slight bit changed but it doesn't do well. I feel even Ranveer's acting was below the performance considering his performance in Padmavat is brilliant. No characters in this film have any correlation and feels forced. The Rape situation seems overtly used to bring the ending. Unnecessary BGM and inclusion of Ajay Devgan and Akshay seems horrible. Even though the director is taking a leap to connect two different films, but it actually feels bloated and slides away from the core concept. It's horrible direction in a way. But if you are looking for a popcorn, less caring movie, yes this is good just fun movie to watch. But if you watched Temper and think it's going to be a performance driven movie, than it's going to make you cringe. Rana was unused too. These kind of movies are one in 100 in every regional movies, there is nothing special about it. I feel it's only ran because of the starcast in it and name of the director in industry.",Simmba

30,titonsahashuvo,Only a commercial film; Expected better!!,6,15 May 2019,"The story line up doesn't seems to be strong enough. In the 1st half I was totally bored as the progress was unnecessarily slow. Boring comedies & fights were really unpleasant. I could say that this funny film tries to attract the viewers by public emotion, RAPE issue & finally by the arrival of 'Singham' i,e Ajoy. I've rated 6 only for the serious RAPE issue, the message it tried to deliver & the loving speech ""No arrest, no long court cases, justice on the spot"". But this might be better one.",Simmba
31,syedsafwaan,4 stars only for sara ali khan,4,27 June 2019,Sara's voice and acting i can't imagine i thought she will be flop actress but she handled small role very well... Ranveer singh overacted in this movie...i like him but not in this movie much... story isn't good at all....,Simmba
32,arupghose,Don't think too much. Just enjoy it!,8,2 January 2019,"Simmba was clearly made with Ranveer Singh in mind because I cannot think who else could play this high energy, over the top character but the man himself. The role is perfect for the kind of person he is (off screen) so quite naturally he did the role justice. His funny one liners will leave you in splits whilst his action is outstanding. YES it is over the top sometimes, but you just have to live with it and move on, after all it is Rohit Shetty and Ranveer Singh! The first half is full of fun and frolic whilst the second half is intense and dark.Sara Ali Khan has very limited scope in the film but she looks stunning and has a nice chemistry with Ranveer. Sonu Sood is just fantastic and delivers a Dabangg like performance yet again. Ajay Devgn got the biggest cheer of them all after his entry and his small cameo performance was outstanding.On the whole it's an entertaining film bringing out the best of Rohit and Ranveer's strengths. Rohit needs to continue with such police films as it is clearly his strength and perhaps give Golmaal a rest for a while!",Simmba
33,bvnisarga,Ranveer Singh as 'Simmba' is Infectious,7,16 January 2019,"I have conflicting thoughts about the movie as a whole. While the first half was delightful and hilarious, The second half just dragged it down. The two halves are completely different like they were two separate movies.
What was consistent throughout was Ranveer Singh. His performance as 'Simmba' was infectious. Whether it was action or drama or comedy he just excelled. 'Simmba' as a protagonist is so charming, witty and gleeful, that it is hard to not get sucked in. (The scenes featuring the interactions between 'Simmba' and his subordinates are the best).
It was a delight to watch Ranveer Singh on screen and his performance is what elevates this movie from being a stereotypical masala movie.",Simmba

36,abhineet150,#Thumbs down -A movie copied from #Temper,2,28 December 2018,"The movie is a copy of south Indian movie and familiar plot to movie Temper.
The times when we are having movies like Tumbbad,Andhadhun,Stree,Badhaai Ho etc and on the other hand there is movie like Simbaa which brings nothing new to plate.Just a hindi version of south Indian movie.
K.G.F is far more better and I shouldn't even compare it with such movies.
People who haven't watched #Temper will find Simmba attractive and paisa vasool but for others it will be 'a not so paisa vasool movie'.The message is strong and its appreciated but thumbs down for bringing nothing new and just copying a movie already exist.Directors and script writers should understand that its an era of Globalisation and we people of India watch all Indian movies whether it be Tamil,Telugu,Marathi,Kannada Bengali etc.So stop copying and remaking the movies which are already made and spoiling the fun for viewers and public investing hard earned movie for buying tickets to watch their movie.Bring creativity and content.",Simmba

42,sourya-mukherjee,An entertainer with a strong social message,7,28 December 2018,"In a year which has delivered good movies like Stree, Andhadhun & Badhai Ho and marred by substandard films like Zero, TOH & Race 3, I must admit that I went to see Simmba with mixed expectations. From that stand point, Simmba has outdone itself and turns out to be a decently good film with a strong social message 👍. Though the script offers nothing new, the dialogues are funny in the first half & pretty intense in the second. The comic element in the movie helps you keep a smile on your face all through to the interval. The second half makes you go through a range of emotions from anger to feeling satisfied with how the script unfolds. Ranveer Singh delivers a good performance but Sonu Sood steals the show with an amazing performance in a negative role. I won't be surprised if the latter bags an award or two for his performance. Sara Ali Khan's role is inconsequential and adds nothing but glamour to the film. Her role is too short for anyone to figure if she's any good. As a result, I'm left wondering that for a movie which intends to stand up for women, why would you use the female lead in the same film for glamour & serve as the love interest of the protagonist and nothing else. Disappointing! The direction is good & so are the support casts (especially Ashutosh Rana & Siddhartha Jadhav). Music is a let down. I mean, come on guys...I miss the good old days when we used to hear original scores. All we hear nowadays are remakes of old songs! What a shame! Overall, Simmba is an entertainer and a good family watch this year end 😊. So go ahead and grab a ticket!",Simmba
43,gawarof,"Mind blowingly inconsistent (both spoiler , non spoiler review)",7,13 January 2019,"Some disclaimers : If you love logic , and can't buy a second without it. Dont see this.
Also if you've not seen old RS movies , don't see it.
Also if you're not a fan of Bollywood movies or dont have a open minded approach for movies , Don't watch this.Also somethings , Hats of to Ranveer Singh. Also something makes me feel this movie got rushed and is incomplete , the reason I think I know why it did , but only can talk about it in spoiler reviewNon spoiler:
I'd say the first half gets a 2 /10 from me. The first half is just 15 minutes long , rest all is filler. In 30 minutes you see characters that needed to be built but nothing more than that. You can literally just miss the whole first half and enter the movie for second oneSecond half gets a 6.5/10
It's not even that good. Logic is not even a thing , but at least it can entertain you. It starts to take heat and movie actually feels it has something to showLast 20 minutes : 9/10
Hard to explain this without spoiling the movie. Just get that this part still has no logic , but will entertain you if you let it.Base line: Don't keep your expectations high , watch this if you enjoy RShetty movies. Try to have a open mind and try to think about why he did that in the last 20 mins of the film##Spoilers##..
...........................
##spoilered review starts##***Spoilered Review***
I'd say Rshetty has a big ambition , I get that ambition and that's why I rate this. He is creating some sort of Indian MCU with police. This movie needed to be made as it's just a making for the next big one's to come. Until that final Avengers like movie arrivesIf Infinity War was a standalone , it'd be the worst movie yet. But it gets built by older movies , and is building for A4.Same goes for this , Simbaa is simply adding Ranveer singh to RShettys universe. He created a flick to let people know what Simbaa is , and what to expect from him. Same would go for Suryavanhi.The films edit is very very badly handled though. Same was for 2.0 when I saw it. They just cut it so much that movie starts becoming inconsistent.",Simmba

Rohit Shetty's new sequel series is ready with its first part Simba and Ranveer Singh is in new getup replacing Ajay Devgan. Movie is fully entertaining and a typical filmy drama between Police officer as Hero and Gangster as Villian.

After Singham I would say Simmba is second on the list of his best work.It's a typical Bollywood masala flick about a corrupt cop who thinks money is everything until he learns his lesson and tries to bring justice to a victim and corrects himself. The case was great and it was delightful to see Ashotosh Rana. Sara Ali was good and had a balanced role but nothing major contribution. Ajay entry was perfect and cameo from Akshay hints another spin off of cop flicks. Ranveer was good but at time I found him overacted in some scenes.For full entertainment I gave it 9/10
It may not be a big budget film (apart from Ranveer signing amount 😜) but definitely more fun to watch than Zero and TOH",Simmba

Maybe it's just me, but i'm not a fan. Not Bajirao, not Padmavat and certainly not Simmba. Maybe Gully Boy will change it?
Ashutosh Rana was good; Sonu Sood was good as well. Sarah Ali Khan didn't have much to do, but is easy on the eyes. The cameos are good. Tanish Bakshi's remixed version of Aankh Maare is well done(for a change).
The film itself isn't too bad and actually quite entertaining especially the dialogues. The screenplay and writing are watertight as well and the pace moves. There aren't too many dull moments but there are a few cringe worthy scenes, especially the ones featuring the young Simmbaa.
While Rohit Shetty has exploited the famous Delhi assault case to create an important sub plot (and made it feel gimmicky in the end), the assault itself is handled well without causing any titillation.
But it's my non-fondness of the lead actor at the end of the day that makes this possibly 7 or 8/10 film, a 6.",Simmba

62,ucsaurabh,Originality cannot be copied,5,21 March 2019,"'Simmba' is an official remake of the Telugu language blockbuster 'Temper' starring Jr. NTR as the and Kajal Agarwal as main leads.
Comparing both the films:
1. First half: Most of the first of the film remains the same. The original has a better character designed and performed whereas Ranveer Singh fails to make most from the character. His language command was disappointing and overacting was just intolerable.
2. Second half: The script for 'Simmba' is not the same as that of 'Temper'. The script is about 50% same as the remaining was written. I feel the script was changed just for the entry of Ajay Devgn. The change in script is appreciated but still couldn't make most of it.
Overview: The length of movie is about an average Bollywood film but still feel too stretched. The movie cannot be termed as masala one but an entertaining one would be better.
The original version 'Temper' is way to awesome and the character is perfectly depicted by Jr. NTR ;Kajal Agarwal in the original version do have a less screen time so as Sara Ali Khan. But sometimes a guest appearance lasts for more than Sara Ali Khan's character.

Almost every scene is elevated by the brilliant peppy and apt background score. Acting was good throughout but Ranvir Singh stands out by giving his all to this role. Although for about half an hour in the second half, the movie tries to be preachy with utterly formulaic sappy crap but it recovers very well.

88,sur1503,Fun Action Great Movie,10,29 December 2018,I don't know why these many negative reviews for this one of the best pure entertainer movie. May be all the Khan fans came together to bring these non-positive reviews. This movie is for action lovers. Full all round comedy action packed drama movie. If you love other Singham movies and fan of really entertaining picture then go for it. You won't be bored at all.,Simmba
89,SayeemShams95,"Why so much hatred towards this film? Remake of TEMPER, that's why?",7,22 January 2019,"I think this is the best film of Rohit Shetty. A well packed action, masala, entertaining film with emotional and strong social engagements.",Simmba
90,ahooda-85743,"Ranveer Singh nailed it, despite weak script and sloppy direction",8,2 January 2019,"It is pretty disheartening to see how Bollywood is quite terribly influenced by South Indian cinema, which depicts their actors in larger than life characters with no realism. I would any day take original Bengali directors and Punjabi directors of black and white cinema over South Indian masala directors, but it's certainly not worth 1 star, which most of the people have given to this movie. Just for Ranveer's acting, this movie is worth at least 7 to 8 stars. Ranveer has proved his mettle depite movie's terrible script, screenplay and its sloppy intent. Additionally, Sonu Sood and Ashutosh rana did great justice to the film.",Simmba
91,tasneembrownms,This movie was great.,10,10 August 2019,"I enjoyed everything about this movie. When it took the dark turn that it took, I was shocked and found myself even more invested in this movie. Ranveer absolutely encapsulated the spirit of Simmba and owned his role. Dealing with the all to present issue of rape was a sensitive matter, dealt with responsibly and issued a sort of justice in the end. Wow",Simmba

95,sulemanfazli,Full on entertainer!,10,12 May 2019,"This was the masala type of movie that I was missing for in such a long time. Finally they made this and with Ranveer Singh! He was outstanding as Simmba! His comic timing is amazing. Sara Ali Khan is a gem and I genuinely like her as an actress. The songs were catchy and groovy. Along with all this, there is an important lesson in the movie to learn that will make the audience emotional. The movie is a full on entertainer.",Simmba
96,shreedharlokhande,Third class movie with third class storyline.,1,1 September 2020,"Logic, physics and story is completely ruined by this movie. We Indians should stop watching this kind of crap because the reason of making such kind of movies are just to launch nepokids.",Simmba
97,shwets_3009,Fun movie,8,31 December 2018,Good entertainment and a no brainer movie! Loved RS and Sara is cute,Simmba
98,ThirtyOne31,Not Rohit Shetty's standard,4,1 January 2019,I have watched all the movies of Rohit. He is master in his work but this is a bit on low side. Specially first half is too stretched and nothing new. I'm giving it 4 stars only for Ajay. Best part of the movie to me is last 45 mins.,Simmba
99,suraj-75574,Simmba Review- Suraj Menon,7,28 April 2019,"Simmba: Never expected much from this movie after watching the trailer as singham 2 was a dud. But Simmba makes the perfect opening in Rohit Shetty's long run cop movies. This year's super entertainer movie also highlights one of the biggest crime which is rising in our country. The credit goes to Rohit Shetty's direction which also has a mind blowing background score. These scenes do make you feel like whistling even if you can't. Just like how Ajay Devgan is made for Singham character, Ranveer Singh and Simmba are just made for each other. Hats off to Ranveer Singh for the brilliant performance and hard-work put in for this role. Sarah Ali Khan has hardly anything to do in this movie. The turn over from being a corrupt cop to a saviour after a horrendous incident is depicted smoothly. Many good comic timings in few scenes and equally emotional moments which bring out tears of sadness. All credit goes to the casting team where every actor does a great job in their respective characters. Almost nearing 3 hours makes it a little too stretchy. Even then not a moment of boredom. Worth the money.
Rating: 7/10",Simmba
100,rajpootaman,A MUST WATCH,10,28 December 2018,"A movie we all needed at this holiday season.

105,surajitbaishya,Justice ! And It Happened in Hyderabad,10,10 December 2019,"Watched it after the recent Hyderabad police encounter of all the four rapists regarding the Disha rape and murder case. I'm just shocked seeing the Hyderabad case coincidence with this film. That's how justice is delivered to the victim when so called supreme court and laws can't give punishment or death penalty to those bast*rds.
I didn't watch the film on theater because my expectation was low about this film. But now after watching it I'm thinking like this movie is the reality of our country. It's a gem of a movie.",Simmba

115,bhavikcoolrockstar,"A one time watch, could have been better.. but not disappointing",5,31 January 2019,"Simbba is a full-on masala action movie like any other remake that bollywood produces.... Simbba had a good plot, but script had over the top dialogues and over the top action sequences... Screenplay seemed to be good compared to temper....
The performances aren't that good, though Ranveer Singh is a great actor, but doesn't really act here.. he simply overreacts or over acts in the situations.. Sara Ali Khan had a small role but did a good job ... Sonu Sood is also good as villian...
Songs are good, Tere bin is a one song that you would love to hear, aankh mere remake isn't better than original but sounds good in the movie..
Director Rohit Shetty has given his fans another masala movie with every element but it fails to achieve what it stands for and doesn't make a great impact leaving the theatre....
Well, if you love watching bollywood masala movie,this one is for you, but if you want something great, just avoid , and one the whole ,it can be a good timepass",Simmba
116,tanaisha,Ranveer - the Hero!!,6,24 March 2019,"It's an out & out a Ranveer Singh movie, there ain't a scene without him. He is funny, dramatic & an action hero all packed in one.

I didn't have much expectation from this 🍿 movie as I didn't liked the trailer.Film is full of slapstick dialoges, but lack intense conviction for the reason of fight. Despite of being a lengthy movie, I was not able to connect with the cause of partagonist for being rebellious against main villain with him he had a good relation.Villain looks villanious however none of his act has convinced me that he was con.Well you can't see a movie only for slapsticks and action. It need good character building and script.Ranveer does overacting as expected from him in such role.",Simmba

215,MoVieeAtor,A total Bollywoodiya movie,6,29 December 2018,"Story:-
Storyline is a very typical B-grade Bollywood story with a very powerful message. You can even guess character's dialogues. So nothing new in the story line.Direction:-
A director is always like a pilot who can crash a brand new super smart car or a pilot who can win a race with even a old generation car.
In case of Simmba, director Rohit Shetty clearly won this race with a very old script. Rohit Shetty direction made every scene very interesting. A praiseworthy direction by Rohit Shetty. We can hope there must be Simmba2 in his mind.Music:-
Music was decent nothing like you would croon after listing songs. Ladki ankh mare is good party song.
But yes i want to add that background music is awesome. You get more in to situation just because of its background music.Acting:-
Ranveer Singh has been a champ since he came to Bollywood industry. Ranveer gave a very powerful performance in Simmba. Now you can say that we have a new action hero in Bollywood. His dialogue delivery, his comic act, his emotional act ,his action, all were superb. Ranveer is the only thing in this movie why you would love to watch this movie again and again.
Sara was decent in movie. There was not much space for her in the movie.
Sonu Sood was fine as he has already delivered this kind of performance in same character.Special:-
I can bet you that you will feel to whistle and clap over Ajay Devgan's entry on the screen in super Bollywood style. And yes there is one more cameo of Akshay Kumar.Summary:- Entertaining movie, you would not feel cheated after spending your money and time. And a must watch movie for Ranveer Sing fans.
I will give this movie 5 and +1 for Ajay's cameo = Total 6/10",Simmba

217,debgh,No justice,2,28 December 2018,Plot and idea is good but the rest is pathetic. Whole concept doesnt make any sense although i admit Rohit Shetty has a strong message to share but it has been shared in his same way which is vry poor,Simmba
218,actgoyal,Watch it for Ranveer and Rohit Shetty,7,29 December 2018,"Even after watching Temper 2 times, Simba look very refreshing. Rohit molded the story very well and add its flavour to it. Ranveer is superb little bit more energy. Sara has only 10 min presence but looking beautiful and talented actress. Songs are average.

I did enjoy Singham some but I liked Simmba more because of what case it was addressing. I too feel very strongly about such victims. Direction and acting is nothing to write home about. Direction follows the same formula as earlier movies that villains are getting swatted away in slow motion. Movie includes couple of romantic songs. Ranveer is being his usual brash self, nothing new to see there. Despite all its' flaws, it was exciting to see Singham join Simmba to kick ass and then to top it all off, Akshay Kumar's surprise appearance at the end. It would be great if Chulbul Pandey joins them.",Simmba

Looks like he's still in the fantasy world of a 5 Yr old where he can see cars and people flying and drivers jumping out and acting out of moving cars. Utter Nonsense.The climax of the movie is shot in a rush and used for promoting his next upcoming movie in 2019. Seems like he's taking a clue from avengers about joining the singham and simba house together.Overall, comedy by Ranveer singh is good.",Simmba

429,anujnaik,Simmba- revisiting the good old 90's with Shetty Flavour,7,28 December 2018,"SIMMBADirector : Rohit ShettyWitness yet another commercial potboiler by ""Rohit Shetty and Team""(that's how he credits it) wherein you need leave your brain as well as basic logic at home and sit with a bucket of 🍿 to be bombarded with a heavy dosage of action, comedy and oodles of melodrama.The movie is centred around a corrupt cop Sangram Bhalerao aka Simmba(Ranveer Singh) who accepts bribe at the drop of a hat, protects criminals and is as good as a pet loyal dog to the local don (Sonu Sood) who along with his brothers runs a drug mafia business using a pub as the centre and children as drug carriers. A heinous crime involving the brutal gangrape and murder of a teacher (Vaidehi Parashurami) brings a complete transformation in Simmba who turns righteous overnight and fights for justice.Rohit Shetty is best known for mindless yet profit earning propositions like the Singham and Golmaal franchise. Simbba is also high on the commercial entertainer parameter with a heavy dose of Shetty trademark action sequences bordering on violence and the stereotypical Bollywood comedy. Shetty also uses the feminist angle to woo the audiences this time. Technically it's extremely poor with highly disappointing remixes, lacklustre screenplay and editing. Action is definitely the upper selling point here.Ranveer Singh mouths dialogues exactly the way he did whilst playing Bajirao, yet one must applaud this actor for having the ability to display multiple expressions in a few nano seconds, he's there in every frame and fits the character perfectly. Ashutosh Rana is marvellous and a delight to watch playing an honest middle aged constable. Sonu Sood frowns and flexes his biceps to justify his villainous streak. The comedy angle is taken care of by Siddharth Jadhav, Vijay Patkar and other actors playing the constables. Vipin Sharma, Uday Tikekar are cast in regular corrupt politician roles and they ham through their acts. Special mention of actor Nandu Madhav who plays his part really well.Vaidehi Parashurami is excellent, The gorgeous Sara Ali Khan is wasted in a blink and miss kind of role yet she is pleasant to watch. There is an entire Mahila Morcha brigade in the movie comprising Suchitra Bandekar, Sulabha Arya, Neha Mahajan and others. Ever irritating Ashwini Kalshekar yet again overacts and is too loud.What works is an reliable lead actor who very sincerely carries the movie on his strong shoulders and the heavy dosage of action comedy that can easily cater to the audiences. What doesn't work would be a hackneyed storyline that resembles 90's movies which dealt with the ""rape and revenge"" theme and the dramatic melodrama that may not go down well with the millennial audience. Overall Rohit Shetty has a confirmed winner on the cards.",Simmba
430,sppkapple,A Movie to kill you time,5,13 January 2019,"The movie is a typical style of Rohit Shetty, similar to ones he has fone prior to Singham. I still wonder why was Ranveer Singh chosen for the role. He shows of his crazy acts, through his weird body language all through the movie. Sara hardly has any screen presence.
The five star that is rated is just cos of Ajay Devgan, cos the movie got interesting only when he comes into it.",Simmba
431,abhijan-35473,Avengers in Bollywood?,4,1 January 2019,"If only Salman Khan also teams up with Rohit Shetty, Avengers can be made here in Bollywood. Simmba, Singham, Sooryavanshi & Chulbul Pandey.

432,asifhaqueshayyan,"A great anti-rape movie, it's worth watching and praises.",7,10 February 2019,"This movie is much better than those similar titled and poster movies in action genre. This is not just any super hit action film, it's also a very good social enlightening movie with some great awareness. My expectation was 1/3 of my after watching critic. Not many Indian films do this, the director and the story writers did mostly right. There were some very minor mistakes and negative awareness/ insensitivity, which is present in many top movies of all time. This movie is quite better than ""Udta Punjab"" and a little worse than ""Udaan"". Which means it definitely should gain at least 7.0 IMDb Rating. Lot of less worthy movies got more than that. Also, somehow some people (135 at my writing time) giving it 1 star out of 10, which is just careless or bad intentions I think, look at the 1 star reviews, they are writing irrelevant stuff. I hope you good people think about this movie and give actual ratings.",Simmba

504,alokkawle,"Why Mr Shetty, why?",5,24 March 2019,"The movie is good to an extent. Can't say m a fan of Ranvir Singh, but like that dude's acting. He's got it embedded in his DNA. Few.good certain scenes but same old action sequences. Bored of it. Royal screw up of time lines. Boy grows up orphan in shivgad (singham's area) and becomes a corrupt cop and get transferred to Mira mar police station (again singham's area. Maybe). So Mr. Big thug Durga Ranade , a big name amongst politicians, so definitely should know another Mr. Big thug jayakant shikare from Singham 1 (fyi also from Panaji Mira mar) so these two has panajai under them and they don't know each other? Cool. The actor playing a famous journalist in Singham 2 is playing a judge here and the guy playing jayakant shikare's regards right hand is now a lawyer here. Awesome career change for these two. (There should've been a bit mention of jayakant shikare. Loved his acting) so yeah...royal screw up of time line in Bollywood's first crossover?",Simmba

When it started, I felt it wouldn't live up to my expectations but as and when the movie progresses, you realize that it is just like another Rohit shetty's movie. I don't think anyone else can show a cop like this. They have picked up the topic of rape and the expected punishment of a common man associated with it.. Ranveer Singh has proven yet again that he can pull of any role well, Sara Ali Khan was under utilised but did justice to her role, didn't appear to be her first/second screen presence. Amazing acting by all the actors, Rohit shetty's crew is amazing, Sonu sood is great as a villain.. 2 songs remade are really good, and the other two were average.. I don't think anyone can match up with Rohit Shetty's dialogues and background score.. Just amazing.. Cherry on cake is how Singham joins Simba.. Definitely seenti maar entry and the climax scene to let us know about his 2019 release was just outstanding.. At last would definitely suggest you to see this movie.

3. Weird DialoguesThe Second Half begins with a serious issue. However, you don't feel connected to the drama. (You can't really expect such things from a Rohit-Shetty Movie)*Court Room Sequence*The Court Room Sequence is utterly nonsense.
The Lawyer and the Judge are Over-Acting.
By the time you digest that scene , another ""WTF"" scene is ready to break your head.*Police Station Sequence*Ranveer Singh tries to instigate the rapists by calling them *impotent* and the Ladies in the police station laughs and says "" Haan Inke toh Baski hi Ni hai kuch.""
Like seriously ??
A serious issue is dealt with such dialogues.*Ending* -
Sonu Sood is in his usual role (A solid villain waiting to lose in the end)

But when we actually look into movie.. 3/4th of the story looks similar but the story is narrated in a different way in Rohit shetty style.. And ranvir singh acting was really energetic.... heroine is just added for the movie glamour and another point of movie climax is in different way.. Not has same.... Whenever we see rohit shetty movies Goa is compulsory ..the same thing he added that goa police where hero has been transferred..
Plus points.
1) Hero acting.
2) Background music was good.
3) Screen play was good.
4) Ajay devgans entry.
5) Right use of comedy.

634,alirahmat-95356,Very average movie,6,28 December 2018,The start of the film is not at all interesting. The first half is dull and boring with slight punches here and there. Even though film has some high notes in 2nd half but weak story and plot never takes it to a great level. Also Ranveer singh' s acting has to be questioned as the character was not given the justice. The film goes nowhere but centres around a good social message in the 2nd half.,Simmba

Ranveer has acted really well but Sara Ali Khan is not given much scope.The story is simple but with a good social message. There is great action, music and acting by all. The supporting cast have also done a good job and above all the last 20 minutes and finale is excellent and very enjoyable. (Please watch the end credits in full)Bottom line is if you are looking for good ""popcorn entertainment"" then this delivers on ALL fronts.One thing I need to point out is that this film is not as stupid and silly as some of the others like Dabbang or Golmaal or Chennai Express as they were completely over the top.Entertainment wise this is 10/10

I am not a fan of Rohit Shetty's Golmaal series but I loved Singham and Chennai Express was not too bad either. They were frivolous but at the same time very amusing and nostalgic. In my opinion, Simmba excels in the same genre.Simmba marvels in its dialogues. Some of the punch lines are perfectly timed and quite comical. There are lots of moments across the movie that would surely make you laugh out loud! Its is silly but it is VERY entertaining. Second half of the movie deals with a serious social issue but it retains its funny moments. If you had a bad day, go and watch this movie, I guarantee your stress will be gone!I was surprised when I looked at all these early reviews who are explicitly underrating this brilliant movie. It almost looks like a coordinated attack on the credibility of this extremely entertaining movie.11/10 stars from me. Don't miss it, you'll thank me later.",Simmba

Audience have started accepting the fact that movie should have story or should be entertaining enough to crush 2 hrs of reel time. Rohit Shetty delivers what he is famous for , a cop story with more masala with hinge of content driven story. You can't expect a mind blower. Just go with a mind set getting hoots, whistle and lots of applauds in between scene. Ranveer did his role well and will be remembered like the characters chulbul pandey and singham. Just felt second half of bit strechted but its okay when your a building a story you can't abruptly cut through scenes. Ajay devgan's cameo best till date. Sara was cute and her screen space was quite limited. One thing to be mention which no one wrote was the background score by Amar Mohile blended perfectlyNot saying its must watch, but if you are out of option for weekends try this.",Simmba

1) Poor Screenplay despite Being a Temper Remake
2) Dialogues Aren't Clap worthy Either, First time for a Rohit Shetty Film
3) Emotions Aren't Quite Connectable To The Audiences, Actually You would Feel like a Loo break

It is a comedy and thrilling movie which everyone will like. So I suggest everyone to go see this movie. I love their acting. Mostly Ranveer Singh's dialogues. It's just unbelievably! No questions! I didn't realize at first. This is the first ever movie that makes love which is directed by Rohit Shetty. People may not like it due to mix genre's. It's OK if you don't. People have different opinions. PEOPLE THINK THIS MOVIE AS REALITY! What happens if drugs are spreaded? Who will take action? Who will fight for this? So somebody has to take it as consideration....",Simmba

708,lalit-krishnani7,Average regular bollywood stuff,4,22 March 2019,Nothing new to watch. Some old police type of movie. Not a fan of Rohit shetty but Ranveer's. Even he did overacting in some scenes. Saw some 10/10 reviews which shows the taste of Indian cinema viewers. Better to utilise the time in something fruitful.Conclusion : Below average regular bollywood movie. Can be avoided.,Simmba
709,akshayv73,Average movie with illogical ending,1,30 December 2018,"Audience saying simmba a copy of temper are wrong only the plot of that movie is taken climax is different in simmba and that is the worst and weak part of the film .It is absolutely illogical dumb where ranveer tries to provoke the rapist and ajay devgn,a neutral officer without doing any investigation declaring that ranveer encountered the rapist as a result of his self defense if they would have copied the climax of temper it would have been much better where jr ntr takes blame on himself so that rapist couldn't escape from punishment. Atleast temper had a logical ending but ending of simmba is a joke this proves that bollywood writers lacks in producing content and hence end up giving us illogical climax and above that ranveer singh's overacting and his pathetic dialogues is enough to make this film boring. Bollywood has a lot to learn from south",Simmba

711,kaldenss,DUE TO TROLLS VOTING 1 star i am forced to give it a 10 star.,10,29 December 2018,This movie is a solid 8. Ranveer and Sara gives good performance. It starts really slow but the tension quickly picks up into the intermission giving a solid 40 minutes into climax. Where i deduct the 2 points is ajay devgans character felt like a sequel bait and unnesecary and made ranveer look like a side character. I felt that it forced the story to go in a direction just to incorporate Ajay. Also the ending felt a little rushed without much resolution. Some scenes at overplay of the background music in tense situation. Overall if it wasnt for the final 20 minutes this movie it coulda been 10/10 but its still very enjoyable.Thats all for the negatives. Comedy drama and action is straight masala paisa vashool. Moneys worth in the end. This is a a must see film if only for Ranveer Singh.,Simmba
712,grgsusana,Full on entertainment,9,31 December 2018,It is a full on entertainment movie worth watching on big screen and a must watch if you're a Raveer Singh fan. He is absolutely mindblowing in the movie and leaves you wanting more.,Simmba

Hats off to Ranveer 👌. Comedy in first half was worth every penny. And the way he carried emotional scenes in second half made whole theatre cry. That seen was not at all cry worthy without such a exceptional performance.
Cameos of Singham Ajay sir & Akshay Kumar were mind blowing.
Dialogue were super!! Sara is so charming 😻.
Lastly just wanted to say I watched first day first show of movie & while booking tickets I noticed IMDb already had tons of reviews of movies. With curiosity I read them means how's that possible to review movie without actually watching. Then stalked there ids & found out they gave 10 stars to zero. Now you people will also get it how this movie got such low rating on IMDb.
Just advice to such people plz dont damage other people hard work for your love of other actor. If you're that greater fan then Respect others work also & help your movie without damaging image of movies.

This movie completely goes to Ranveer Singh who has proved it again that he is one of the best entertainers of Bollywood. He comic timing is just amazing, also his face expressions in emotional scenes seem to be very natural and true.
Sara Ali Khan looks good but has nothing to do much. Music (although 50% of the songs are remake) is very soothing and entertaining.

Just like him, Shetty provides us an entertaining film with not so good screenplay. But, this time he has excelled in his story part. The story is good and conveys a strong message. Ranveer Singh's electrifying performance does mention an applause. Sara Ali Khan is decent to watch.

807,sharmamanishpre,A serious threat to your intellect and senses,1,28 December 2018,"I am a self confessed Ranveer Singh fan. More so now that he has my favorite Deepika as his wife. But, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE RANVEER!! I understand this movie is for the masses, which unfortunately is not a yardstick I want my countrymen to be judged with. Though the movie speaks of ""Protecting Women"" and uplifting them. There are great ways to go about it and the police becoming a vigilante is not one of them. The movie defeats its own logic here. Imagine a corrupt officer would have let so many crimes committed against women until one happened to one close to him. This is a subtle message that is being conveyed. And if we keep watching and promoting these misplaced ideas of ""Protecting"" women, then I am ashamed to say that my girl will expect for men to stand up for her in case she is in trouble or my son would consider himself to be a torch bearer of women's ""Safety"". It is a seriously regressive approach to movie making. On the one hand we see great movies like Andhadhun, Badhai ho, Masan, and then we still have movies like Race3, Zero and now this. Please do not watch these types of movies save your money and buy a good book to read.",Simmba

841,fakhriaalmas,"Very good movie, met expectations but it could have been a little more improved.",8,29 December 2018,"I just watched this movie and had some thoughts.
Cons/things needed to improve
-the movie is over dramatic and has a lot of slo mo wasting time. Now I understand that they wanted to approach the movie in a different way but instead of doing that it I had to watch a whole scene of a 10 min slo mo that just wouldn't end. The movie is very dramatic and it makes the audience confused on why that character is doing that.
poor story line. I would have wanted to know a little more past on the main character, I would have watched that rather than watching him chase guys in slow mo. The character would have been more built and it would have helped connect the audience more.even though the movie is not that long, it felt very short somehow like they wanted to do that. Most parts are left unanswered and confusing.the relationship between the characters are not built properly, the female lead in the movie had very little part in this movie, I was not expecting a romantic movie as ranvir Singh just got married but I would wanted a little better connections, another character is the victim in the movie, I still don't get how they just met and already act like they have known each other for years and make summba feel rage in a way where his whole life changed.-repeated idea, we have had a lot of movie with this kinda idea so the only difference was the actor and since of humor so I would have liked a different approach to Bollywood movies.Pros/things like about the movie
the actor makes very good role for there kind of movies where there is comdy involved and very bass music. The role was played well and it gives you an unforgettable feeling.some songs are still stuck on my mind and are very good and bass there are some that are not so great but overall the songs were good.-the actors in the film all have the police type of movies so it was fun to see all those actors together in a movie.
overall this had a very good message to women and having your voice heard and if you believe if something you can make it come true.loved this movie and I been seeming some lack of ideas/ old feeling of Bollywood movies missing and this movie helped it come back a bit. You should watch it.",Simmba

859,mariahray,A typical masala movie - worth a watch,9,29 December 2018,"Ranveer Singh has announced himself as this generations superstar with Simmba. He started the year with the deliciously evil Khilji and has ended it with the affable Simmba - a corrupt cop who grows a conscience.Rohit Shetty adopts the typical tropes of a masala film, but it is well crafted and works within the narrative. I must admit I preferred the first half to the second where it did feel long and preachy in parts. For a country like India (and a movie made for the mass) I can see why it seemed important put across a social message but it felt heavy handed in parts. Sara Ali Khan as Shagun was good but I personally believe the love story was superfluous to the larger narrative. The movie could have been crafted as an out and out action-comedy film.Crisper editing in the second half of the film would have helped it more but otherwise the movie was well directed and choreographed. Ajay Devgn's entry and a surprise cameo in the end have announced Shetty's intention of creating a universe similar to Justice League or Avengers.The movie should not be watched from the lens of an ""intellectual"" film. It is meant to be an OTT slightly spoofy movie and should be watched and treated as such. It is an entertainer and should not be taken seriously. I would definitely recommend this movie for a one time watch.",Simmba

966,dshinjon,"A Full-On ""Paisa Vasool"" typical Bollywood Movie",10,30 December 2018,"Simmba is not the kind of movie where you have to think too much about what just happened and even though some scenes might seem just as stupid to you after watching it, this movie is just the ultimate joyride required to end the year on a high note. Some people might say that there are characters who were utterly useless to the progression of the plot, however I would like to correct them by saying that the debutant actress has done a fair job in delivering the small part she has. Coming to Ranveer Singh's acting- he has portrayed Simmba with just as energy and zest as Bajirao or the Khilji in the Bhansali Epics. While the first half is replete with funny dialogue delivery and romantic songs, the second half just goes from the planes straight to the top of the hill in terms of seriousness. Overall,it is a movie that one must watch to get over the boredom and monotony of the dreadful weeks of December. A bonus is the last scene of the movie so just don't go out after major action scenes are done.",Simmba

1101,me_jasmine,MASALA ENTERTAINMENT WITH A HEART,10,31 December 2018,"The film is out and out Rohit Shetty style masala movie. The heart of the movie is Ranveer Singh. He has given a lot to the character which does not require so much. But his outstanding charismatic personification of bad cop turned good is a whistle-worthy delight. Each and every scene captures emotions in a perfect note. Not to miss the cameos of the two bollywood superstars are the icing on the cake. Sara Ali Khan is rather very much comfortable with the camera, she is here to stay.
Watch it now for Ranveer Singh's and Rohit Shetty's all heart and hard work. This monsterous combination is ROARING and how.....",Simmba

1118,mpprasad,Pathetic movie and acting,1,14 April 2019,"If you want to watch a movie that features a lot of over acting and is a dumbed down idiotic remake of a great original and makes a joke of a serious crime then go ahead watch this movie. If not, watch the original Telugu movie ""Temper"". Pathetic acting, direction and story modifications. Watch the original instead!",Simmba
1119,evanleslie-15651,The genius of Rohit Shetty.,5,23 March 2019,"The film starts with a gutsy orphan boy, asking a police officer not to touch his head to actually being a police officer because that's where the power lies(he was advised by his Fagin). He grows up to be as corrupt a police officer can be, but the death of a girl shakes him up and he decides to go against the system and beat it, along with villains like Sonu Sood and the Law.The film boasts of awesome cinematography, with realistic action sequences. If its evident that Simmba's fists aren't really connecting with the villain's body and yet there's a loud sound and the person concerned flies away, its because Indian police officers are incredibly powerful and they are specially trained at monasteries where they learn how to bend air and control it.The acting is on point with Sara Ali Khan making her debut as Shagun Sathe who runs a food delivery company right beside a police station. Raanver Singh has played the role of a carefree three starred police officer, with the tattoo of ""police(hindi)"" on his left hand and is jolted back to his senses when someone close to him is raped and killed, only to find himself murdering the accused out of societal pressure and fear of suspension.The plot is dynamic and intriguing, with Rohit Shetty, sprinkling cute romantic scenes sporadically in the movie. The movie has umpteen plot twists and has intense scenes throughout. It has sadly depicted how easy it is to tamper with evidence when someone is powerful enough, and has questioned on the moral compass of Indian police officers who use the uniform for extortion in the beginning and for justified murder later.To conclude, I would say that this film is totally underrated and it definitely deserves a place among classics like Inception or Schindler's List. Its debatable as to whether its worthy of an Oscar, but Ranveer definitely deserves the award for best actor for his on-point natural acting in Simmba. The film would've received international acclaim if not for the item songs as Hollywood doesn't know how to appreciate the beauty in the item songs featuring stars like Tushar Kapoor and Karan Johar.Those of you, who couldn't get enough of Simmba will not be disappointed as Rohit Shetty will be back with yet another masterpiece in 2019, with Akshay Kumar in the uniform.Jai Hind.",Simmba
1120,sailoramit,Awesome movie,7,27 January 2019,Movie was very nice but one thing that is not nice about the movie that ranveer Singh does very much overacting,Simmba
