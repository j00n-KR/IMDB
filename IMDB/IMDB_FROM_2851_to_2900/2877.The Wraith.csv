0,SnoopyStyle,cheesy 50s derivative fun,5,29 March 2015,"Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) and his gang terrorize an Arizona town and force drivers to drag race for their cars. Jake Kesey (Charlie Sheen) is new in town riding in on his bike. He catches the eye of Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn) who is the possessive Packard's girlfriend. She used to be Jamie Hankins' girl before he was killed by Packard. Jake befriends Jamie's brother Billy (Matthew Barry). He slowly takes out Packard's gang as The gun-toting Wraith driving his ghost car. His car is reborn every time it is destroyed. Sheriff Loomis (Randy Quaid) helplessly investigates.With the roller skating burger joint waitresses and the old fashion gang drag races, this has a cheesy derivative 50s feel. It's kind of fun but kind of bad. Charlie Sheen is doing a likable bad boy hero. Sherilyn Fenn looks hot in her bikini. Nick Cassavetes is a forgettable brute. Clint Howard is memorable as the bespectacled gearhead Rughead. This is a cheesy cult movie but limited other than the cool idea.",The Wraith
1,gavin6942,Sadly Disappointing,5,21 December 2015,"Jamie, killed by neighborhood thugs, returns as a mystical figure named Jake the Wraith (Charlie Sheen) to gain revenge.A movie from the 1980s with fast cars and Charlie Sheen? Sounds like a winner, maybe a mix between ""Ferris Bueller"" and The Chase"". Add in Sherilyn Fenn in a pre-""Twin peaks"" role... that has to be good, right? She stole the show there and the under-appreciated ""Boxing Helena"". Oh, and did I mention Clint Howard? But somehow it all seems so bland. Like a made-for-TV movie, and not a very good one, at that. I feel like the exact same story, with a little spit and polish could have been a minor masterpiece. But no. Somehow this gets labeled a ""horror"" film, but that is quite the stretch. Though it is not much of anything else either.",The Wraith
2,lee_eisenberg,so many things rolled into one cool movie,10,17 November 2007,"Maybe if you've seen one 1980s horror/sci-fi/romance, you've seen them all. But you still need to see ""The Wraith"". It portrays a young guy (Charlie Sheen) riding into a small Arizona town which seems to be nearly run by a gang of hoodlums. The gang leader (Nick Cassavetes) is very jealous of one of the teenage girls (Sherilyn Fenn) and gets nasty if it looks like anyone else is approaching her. But things start to change for everyone once a strange black car starts driving through town.Think about what all this movie portrays. First off, it stars Martin Sheen's son, John Cassavetes's son, Ron Howard's brother (Clint Howard sports a crazy hairdo and plays the only intelligent member of the gang), and Dennis Quaid's brother (Randy Quaid plays the sheriff and was noticeably leaner back then). Speaking of weight, women in movies were meatier back then; check out Sherilyn Fenn in her waitress outfit (or in another scene)! But another thing is about the definition of the title. A wraith is an apparition, often portending someone's doom (the word comes from Scottish, but I don't know the full origin).Are the car races the highlight? That's debatable. The road looked very much like the same road that they used for the desert scenes in ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", which of course starred another hot babe (I mean Dorothy Provine, hubba hubba).Anyway, this is one that you're sure to love. And just keep watching the skies.Back when Martin Sheen's father immigrated to the US from Spain and John Cassavetes's father immigrated to the US from Greece, they probably never guessed that their grandchildren would co-star in this sort of movie. Hell, back in the days when Ron Howard played Opie on ""The Andy Griffith Show"", people probably never guessed that his brother would star in this sort of movie. I don't know what people would have thought when Randy Quaid debuted in ""The Last Picture Show"".",The Wraith
3,Woodyanders,Vengeance is mine raceth the Wraith,8,6 July 2021,"Young guy Jamie Hawkins gets killed by a gang of road-racing motorhead thugs led by the ruthless Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes in peak sneering hateful form). Mysterious stranger Jake Kesey (a likeable performance by Charlie Sheen) shows up in a Dodge Turbo Interceptor to exact harsh revenge on the gang.Writer/director Mike Marvin relates the enjoyably asinine story at a zippy pace, treats the silly premise with admirable seriousness, stages the exciting vehicular action with rip-roaring aplomb, blows lots of stuff up real good, and even sprinkles in a satisfying smidgeon of tasty bare female skin. Moreover, the solid cast play the inane material with commendably straight faces: Sherilyn Fenn as the sweet Keri Johnson, Randy Quaid as the hard-nosed Sheriff Loomis, and Matthew Berry as the amiable Billy. David Sherill, Jamie Bozian, Griffin O'Neal, Chris Nash, and especially Clint Howard as the geeky Rughead are total hoots as goony gang members. Further enhanced by a pounding rock soundtrack and boasting some gnarly special effects, this honey overall sizes up as a whole lot of goofy fun.",The Wraith
4,BA_Harrison,You've just gotta love the spirit of the 80s.,7,8 June 2009,"Back in 1986, The Wraith just about qualified as a moderately entertaining alternative should the video rental shop be all out of copies of Aliens or Top Gun; however, when watched twenty three years later from a nostalgic point of view, this silly supernatural revenge flick actually proves to be a whole heap of fun. Charlie Sheen's lifeless performance; the sheer naffness of the race scenes; an ever-present pop/rock soundtrack; Nick Cassavetes' ridiculously nasty boo-hiss bad guy; a collection of annoying comic-book punks with idiotic names and silly mannerisms: The Wraith is perfect for anyone looking for some mindless popcorn action and a bit of a laugh at the expense of the decade that taste forgot.Sheen plays a restless spirit who returns from the afterlife in a turbo charged ghost car to seek revenge on the reprehensible road pirates responsible for his death, rescue roller waitress Keri (the scorching Sherilyn Fenn) from the clutches of psychotic killer Packard Walsh (Cassavetes), and say goodbye to his younger brother Billy (Matthew Barry).Although the film's star isn't really given that much to do (for much of the time, Sheen's character is hidden behind he wheel of his otherworldly car or in a silly cyberpunk suit and black full-face helmet), the excellent supporting cast more than make up for his absence: Randy Quaid is great as a desert cop trying to make sense of the carnage; Clint Howard gives another memorable performance as a mechanic with crazy hair; and Fenn is effortlessly sexy, and gets her top off once or twice during proceedings.With more cheese than one of the burgers served up by Keri at the Big K bar, The Wraith is a great time-waster and recommended to all fans of 80s cult cinema.",The Wraith
5,paul_haakonsen,A timeless movie...,6,31 December 2015,"I remembered this movie from my childhood. It was good back then and it actually still holds its own even today. Way before ""Fast and Furious"" there was ""The Wraith"".The story in ""The Wraith"" is about a mysterious stranger who shows up in an Arizonan town terrorized by a gang of brutal drag-racers led by Packard. At the same time does a mysterious car show up too and challenge the gang to a race one by one. The races end with the death of one of the racers. But when the police show up, the corpse is in perfect condition and missing the eyes.""The Wraith"" is an entertaining movie with a good story, fast car races and a fairly good cast that includes Charlie Sheen, Sherilyn Fenn and Randy Quaid.This is one of those types of movies that can be seen several times and it has actually withstood the test of time quite well. If you haven't already seen ""The Wraith"" then you should take the time to sit down and watch it because it is rather enjoyable.",The Wraith
6,Quinoa1984,Needs a tune up,4,13 December 2020,"I cant believe these words are about to come out of my thumbs, but here goes... Michael Bay would have really made something out of this material. I'm not sure it would have been far superior, but it would have been less dull. Or as a half hour twilight zone about a Hot Rodder bully asshole who gets his commuppence from a vengeful alien car could be entertaining, but as a feature it doesn't quite hold enough water (and it buulds up to a ""surprise"" that isnt a surprise in the slightest).Clint Howard's mullet, a few choice 80s songs (the soundtrack had kind of a budget) and a couple of good breasts and wild explosions steal the show; Randy Quaid is acceptable as a local sheriff and Nick Cassavetes channeling occasional menace and mostly a lack of shirts with his black vests as the main baddie. It is also fun seeing a near unrecognizable Sherilyn Fenn, who is sweet and beautiful. On the other hand, it's shocking to see just how little of a damn Sheen gives here; I want to know if this was before or after he was in friggin Platoon, that would explain things.",The Wraith
7,BandSAboutMovies,Beyond underrated,8,27 October 2018,"In another version of our reality, The Wraith was the Top Gun of 1986. People are still wearing t-shirts of it, dressing up in costumes at cons and I have an amazing Jake Kesey action figure on my shelf.As bright lights descend from the heavens - shades of The Visitor - an all black Dodge Turbo Interceptor comes to life, along with a black-garbed driver.Welcome to Brooks, Arizona. This is where Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, exuding pure sexual menace) leads a gang of car thieves that race people for pink slips. Everyone and everything is his property, mainly Keri Johnson (Twin Peak's Sherilyn Fenn), who doesn't remember Packard killing her boyfriend Jamie Hankins (Christopher Bradley).That's when Jake Kesey arrives on a dirt bike. He instantly befriends Keri and Jamie's brother Billy, who both work at Big Kay's, a local drive-in hamburger joint. One day, while they swim at a local river, they both notice huge knife scars on Jake's back.The Turbo Interceptor starts to take over Packard's races, its driver's face never seen, his body covered in armor and metal braces for reasons unexplained. Everyone who races the Wraith, as he comes to be called, is killed, including gang members Oggie Fisher (Griffin O'Neal, April Fool's Day) and Minty. Me, I like Skank and Gutterboy. How can you not love gang members who drink gasoline for an entire movie? I love that they're so high that they refuse to believe in the Wraith. Soon, they get blown up real good.Meanwhile, Sheriff Loomis (a pre-freakout Randy Quaid) is in hot pursuit but never seems to get close. Rughead, the only gang member who didn't help kill Jamie, goes to the police to try and save his skin. He's played by Clint Howard and his amazing hair, a B&S favorite since Evilspeak.Packard still has an iron grip on Keri, despite the fact that she won't give him what he wants: sex. Isn't that what all guys want? Well, once he sees Keri kiss Jake, he kidnaps her and says they're heading for California. She stands up to him and says that she never loved him. The Wraith shows up and Packard finally pays for his crimes. As the police prepare to give chase, Loomis calls it off, as they could never catch him.Keri gets back home and the Wraith pulls up, then transforms into Jake. He tells her that he is her dead boyfriend, but doesn't look like him because ""This is as close as I could come to who I once was."" In truth, Sheen was tied up making Platoon, so they filmed the early scenes without him.But Jake has one last act before he can leave - he gives the Turbo Interceptor to his brother, revealing who he really is. He tells Keri to pack light for where they are going. Where, Jake? Heaven? Outer space? The planet or dimension that sent Tony's dad in Xtro?The Wraith is the very definition of bonkers. It's like Ghost Rider meets The Car meets Rebel Without a Cause by the way of a punk gang from The Road Warrior. It's so many movies in one, with something for everyone to love. It was written and directed by Mike Martin, who also brought us Hamburger: The Motion Picture and directed four movies under the pen name Jake Kesey. Yep. You guessed it. The Wraith himself.",The Wraith
8,Coventry,Revenge of the car-tuning nerds.,3,27 November 2005,"""The Wraith"" is one of those movies I found mega-, super-, hyper-, ultra-cool to watch 15 years ago. It had splendid car chases (not to mention exiting car crashes!), a rocking soundtrack (Billy Idol's ""Rebel Yell""!!) and  last but not least  Charlie Sheen in the period when he was every young boy's idol. In short, ""The Wraith"" represented the flamboyant 80's all by itself and I had absolutely no eye for possible flaws in the production or illogicalness in the script. Well, that funny 80's spirit is long gone now and it's obvious that this movie is nothing more than a brainless, macho-orientated cheeseball. It's still passable entertainment, but only if you pay absolutely no attention to the shallow comic-book story, revolving on an avenging angel in the shape of a black-leathered racer driving a turbo Porsche. Synchronous with his mysterious appearance arrives a new kid in town, strangely resembling a deceased victim of the local thug-gang, led by Corvette-driving Packard. The kid immediately fancies the local beauty Keri, who also is Packard's object of desire, and soon after all the bad guys die in fiery car crashes. Everything in this film is so one-dimensional! Not only the stereotype characters, but also the Arizona town setting, which only seems to exist of one hamburger restaurant and one long open road where the boys play their racing games. There's no school and there are no adults, except for Sheriff Randy Quaid and a handful of nameless cops. Charlie Sheen's bad-boy charisma is overshadowed by his car and Nick Cassavetes makes a pretty pathetic villain. The ravishing Sherilyn Fenn provides ""The Wraith"" with the obligatory 80's nudity and Clint Howard reprises his familiar role of weirdo-loser. In this day and age, ""The Wraith"" is nice to re-watch for its nostalgic value and to realize that it's actually very stupid!",The Wraith
9,Theo Robertson,Works Best As A Nostalgia Piece,4,29 November 2005,"As a story THE WRAITH is very poor . A bunch of thugs led by Packard Walsh challenge residents to road races and the loser has to forfeit his car and strangely enough Packard and the boys never lose . This whole scenario seems very unlikely , seeing as the race is carried out under violent duress has no one ever thought about going to the cops ? Where did these teenagers get the money for the cars and why are there no adults in the town . It's like the town is only inhabited by teenagers and you quickly notice this which makes the unlikely scenario even more unbelievable . Oh and it's one of those movies that thinks it's funny but just ends up embarrassing everyone involved . Example: "" You can't touch me sheriff I know my constipational rights "" . One can't help thinking that screenwriter Mike Marvin now has a career writing Dubya's speeches . BTW it's not until about a third of the way into the running time that it reveals it's a supernatural movie If THE WRAITH works on any level it's as a nostalgia piece as to what the mid 1980s was like , a period that I spent in a drink induced coma and watching this movie I now realise what I was escaping from . OMG the hairstyles of that era must have been influenced by the same guy who designed Gary Glitter's wigs . The music ? You want to talk about the music ? It's a parody of muzak where we hear synthesized guitar rifts and baritone vocals , every scene seems to feature a hit from the era which sounds suspiciously like the exact same hit and leads me to believe that the characters who died in this movie were the lucky ones",The Wraith
10,poolandrews,"""There ain't enough left of him to stick in a cigar box."" Really bad 80's cheese.",3,28 November 2005,"The Wraith starts late one night deep in the Arizona desert as what looks like several balls of electricity fly along just above the ground eventually they merge together & form a futuristic black car & a shadowy mysterious figure that is the wraith. Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) is the leader of a local gang of thugs who terrorise a small town & force other drivers of particularly nice cars to race & forfeit their car if they lose, which of course they always do. Well they always did until the wraith & his supernatural powered turbo charged car turns up, each time one of Packard's gang races the wraith they end up dead starting with Oggie Fisher (Griffin O'Neal) whose car ends up taking a dive off a cliff, Loomis (Randy Quaid) the local Sheriff is on the case. If Packard's ever shrinking gang & the ensuing police investigation isn't enough for him to worry about a new kid in town named Jake Kesey (Charlie Sheen) seems to want to date his girl Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn). As Packard loses grip on the power he has he becomes determined to take revenge on the wraith, however Packard isn't the only one with revenge on his mind...Written & directed by Mike Marvin I really didn't think too much of The Wraith. Before I start I should point out that if you read the IMDb's 'main page' for The Wraith & look at the cast list it gives away the supposed twist at the end, not that you wouldn't have guessed it within 10 minutes anyway but the IMDb usually frowns upon spoilers doesn't it... The script is as daft as they come & it takes itself very seriously, people don't speak like this in real life Mike, OK? The terrible dialogue is delivered straight faced which just doesn't work when your making a film about a supernatural car. If you think The Wraith is a silly concept for a film you would be right, it's also a crap concept for a film. Nothing is explained, how was the wraith created? Why does he get a second chance & no one else? When a couple of dead bodies are recovered from burning cars why are the bodies intact & their eyes missing? This happens a few times during The Wraith & no explanation is given whatsoever & the plot device isn't even used, at all. Why doesn't the wraith just blow Packard away with the shotgun when he had the chance? Why is the only plot twist in the entire film so easy to see coming? What on Earth is Clint Howard's hair do all about?! Why are all the character's so dumb & one dimensional? Why does Charlie Sheen get top billing on the credits yet has about 10 minutes worth of screen time & all but disappears for 45 minutes (not that I'm complaining)? Why did they decide to end things off all 'happily ever after' with plenty of cringe inducing sentimentality in a way Disney would have have been proud of? To it's credit it sort of entertains in a bad grade z sort of way & it moves along at a fair pace so at least it's never overly boring or dull.Director Marvin brings little imagination to the action scenes, two cars racing along a virtually deserted road starts to become tedious after the fourth time. He doesn't seem to know what sort of film he want's to make, action, horror, romance, comedy, Sci-Fi or thriller & ends up with bits of each that don't gel. The wraith himself looks like some sort of Stormtrooper reject from Star Wars (1977), a very cheap suit & crash helmet & he barely has any screen time either. Marvin tries to create some style with the use of bright neon colour although completely fails of course. Forget about any sort of violence as there isn't any worth mentioning but there is some nudity.With a supposed budget of $2,700,000 The Wraith is technically good although nothing spectacular & they should have put more effort into how the wraith himself looked. The stunts are OK & there are some decent explosions but it's nothing we haven't seen a hundred time before & the tings we haven't seen before including a car which can magically reform itself are just plain daft & feel out of place. The photography is good, the rock music is highly annoying & adds nothing to the film but generally speaking it's quite well made. The acting isn't great & Clint Howard's hair deserves a credit all of it's own, Sheen & Cassavetes also have bad 80's hair-dos.Personally I didn't think much of The Wraith although it's just about daft enough to have a certain charm & maybe have a few admirers. I will give it three out of ten stars for some OK explosions, the silliness of it all &, of course, Clint Howard's hair.",The Wraith
11,Bunuel1976,"THE WRAITH (Mike Marvin, 1986) **",4,27 April 2007,"I recall this coming out and had even watched it on VHS back in the day: a teen-oriented revenge drama with supernatural overtones (rather than an out-and-out horror), this one provides double the thrills because, apart from the mystery and the violence, we also get a load of car stunts. Nick Cassavetes gives a mannered performance as the villain - an egomaniac, possessive thug who holds court over the desert town in which the narrative takes place; he likes to demonstrate his power via frequent racing-car duels along the highways, which he invariably wins by cheating. Charlie Sheen is the enigmatic drifter hero who defiantly romances Cassavetes' girl (Sherilyn Fenn) and drives a state-of-the-art 'death proof' car(!), Matthew Barry is the young brother of Fenn's former boyfriend (whom Cassavetes and his gang murdered) who befriends Sheen, and Randy Quaid the gruff but dogged sheriff out to nail Cassavetes. The action scenes are O.K. under the circumstances but, easily the most memorable (and, at the same time, irritating) thing about the entire film is the Tweedle-Dee/Tweedle-Dum pairing of two of Cassavetes' lackeys - one a relentless substance-abuser (his mugging after imbibing on some godawful stuff from a jerry-can is hilarious) sporting a Mohawk, and the other a wimpish half-wit given to unintelligible rants! The revelation at the end (regarding Sheen's identity and the nature of his mission) doesn't exactly come as a surprise.",The Wraith
12,utgard14,"""A wraith, man! A ghost! A evil spirit - and it ain't cool!""",5,15 August 2014,"A small Arizona town is terrorized by a gang of '80s toughs still living in the '50s, drag racing for pink slips. Charlie Sheen plays a new guy in town who, not unlike the Fonz, rides into town one day on his motorcycle and immediately catches the eye of beautiful Sherilyn Fenn. This doesn't sit well with gang leader Nick Cassavetes, who's got a thing for Fenn. At the same time, a mysterious helmeted driver with a black super Porsche shows up and starts taking down the drag-racing gang one by one.Sort of like High Plains Drifter for the brain-dead set. Charlie Sheen is wooden throughout. Sherilyn Fenn is gorgeous and has a nude scene. Her acting stinks though. Villain Nick Cassavetes makes William Zabka look tough. Clint Howard plays one of his cronies. Randy Quaid had bills to pay so he's the sheriff in this. Rock soundtrack is full of '80s goodness. If you're into car movies or '80s cheese, you should enjoy this. It's not high art but I was entertained.",The Wraith
13,Boba_Fett1138,Pretty cool typical '80's revenge flick!,7,4 September 2007,"Oh I feel dirty now, I actually liked this movie! Of course it was some typical '80's cheese but I also have the feeling that the makers really didn't thought that they were making something classic. It's pretty good for what it is; a simple '80's revenge flick, with basically every '80's ingredient in it thinkable.Yes this movie has '80's written all over it! Fast sport cars, crazy dressed punks, roller-skates, bad '80's music and of course '80's star Charlie Sheen in it, just before his ""Platoon"" role, which really marked his breakthrough.The movie and its story is kept fairly simple and because of that the movie also feels very straight-forward, which definitely is a plus for these type of movies. The main plot-line and fun characters are interesting enough to keep your interest. Its a pretty crazy concept and the movie mixes numerous movie types, such as science-fiction, action, horror, a racing movie, drama and much more. It's impossible to label just one genre to this movie and its even more difficult to say how to describe this movie. It's a cheesy silly B-movie, that because of that also at the same time becomes very entertaining to watch.The movie has some nice looking races and the 'Wraith's' car is just basically every teen-boy's, from the '80's, dream. Also the other cars in the movie are really great, despite the fact that I'm really normally not a 'cars' type of person.Let's be fair, Charlie Sheen has never been on any 'great actors lists' and this movie makes you see why. He's too flat in his role but luckily he isn't featured that much in the movie, at least not as much as you would expect from the 'main' character. The movie more focuses on the gang of drag racers, who are the bad guys of the movie, and on whom the 'Wraith' takes revenge, for killing him in the past. The gang features actors such as a young Nick Cassavetes (who now days is perhaps better known as a director) and Clint Howard in it. Further more, Randy Quaid also plays a role in the movie as the sheriff. He's good in his role but he's not really supported by most of the other actors in this movie, which also makes his performance look bad at times.A very enjoyable, good looking, silly, cheesy, typical '80's flick, that you just have to take for what it is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Wraith
14,Uriah43,What Happens when a Gang of Thugs Go a Bit Too Far,6,25 July 2017,"The movie begins with a young man named ""George"" (Steven Eckholdt) down a lonely highway somewhere in Arizona with his girlfriend. Suddenly, a group of cars appear and force him to stop. It's then that a man named ""Packard Walsh"" (Nick Cassavetes) comes up to him and threatens George with physical violence to his girlfriend unless he agrees to race his car against that of Packard's--with the loser having to forfeit their car. Packard wins and both George and his girlfriend are subsequently left out in the middle of nowhere to fend for themselves. The scene then shifts to another young man named ""Jake Kesey"" (Charlie Sheen) riding a motorcycle in the town of Brooks, Arizona and asking a pretty young woman named ""Keri Johnson"" (Sherilyn Fenn) for directions. She offers to show him but as soon as she gets on the motorcycle Packard drives up and tells her to get in his car. She obediently gets in even though is is apparent she wants nothing to do with him. But Packard's days of bullying everybody in town is about to be challenged by a mysterious man driving a sleek black Turbo Interceptor who challenges certain members of Packard's gang to race against him one-on-one. What they don't know is that it isn't their cars that this mysterious figure is after-but rather their lives. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I remember watching this movie in the theater when it first came out and I rather liked it as it had a decent horror plot enhanced by some pretty good action scenes. Admittedly, some parts were kind of hokey but all things considered I found the overall film to enjoyable enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Wraith
15,FlashCallahan,Crow Rider.....,8,5 April 2017,"A small desert town has been harassed for months by a gang of drag racers, but so far no one has done anything to stop them. One day, a ghostly black car shows up, challenging members of the group to race, then killing them one by one. Neither the gang nor the police can catch the car or its driver, but some investigating into the gang's past may reveal just who's behind all this....If you want a film showcasing Charlie Sheen's talents from 1986, seek out Platoon, because even though plays the titular character, he hardly has any screen time.This is Nick Cassavettes film through and through, and he is wonderful as the main villain. Of course the film references Ghost Rider and The Crow, but it feels more like Repo Man in some scenes of the film.The Wraith is a very strange creature, wearing calipers for no no good reason, and has moments standing high on mountains not doing very much at all.Fenn is also quite wonderful as basically Cassavettes punch bag, and the rest of his motley crew look like extras from The Road warrior, another film this references.The car is pretty amazing, and surprisingly, the cinematography is pretty beautiful when we are out in the desert.Randy Quaid pops up as the sheriff, and chews up the scenery whenever he appears.It's a good old eighties classic, with a cool soundtrack, cooler hair, and Clint Howard with the coolest hair in the world ever.",The Wraith
16,Aaron1375,After the first race you have seen it all.,6,25 March 2003,"This movie focuses on a gang of thugs who race cars and take the cars of the losers.  Apparently, the leader of this gang is very possessing of his girlfriend.  So much so he and his gang killed this guy who had slept with her.  Now, a bit of time later this mysterious figure is challenging the gang to races and winning.  Well, let me just say that this movie has its moments, but it needed something more.  For the most part the races were all very similar to each other.  Even the big race between the wraith and the leader of the gang at the end was no different to any other race the wraith was involved in.  And how the heck does this gang of thugs get away with so much?  They should be behind bars, but for some reason the sheriff can't pin anything on them.  There are quite a few flaws in this one, but overall it was an ok movie.  There are some good scenes in it as well.  Though at the end when the guy gave his car to the other guy it left me wondering ""Wouldn't the cops be looking for that car?""",The Wraith
17,The_Void,Disappointing Eighties Trash,5,1 December 2005,"It's a shame that The Wraith is, essentially, a predictable, repetitive mess of a film; because it's so quintessentially eighties that I almost feel guilty for slating it. Eighties films are very nostalgic, and even though I wasn't around for very long in that decade; for some reason or other, I love a film that has a high 'eighties trash' rating. This one's eighties trash rating is through the roof, with fast cars, nudity, terrible dialogue and Charlie Sheen helping to make it so. You can't go into a film like this expecting something other than trash; but I was expecting a good time at least. The film doesn't offer this, however, as it's too tied up with showing car chases...over, and over again. The plot is diluted further by a rather lapse subplot about a girl who's constantly watched by her jealous 'boyfriend', leaving the central theme of Charlie Sheen's revenge on the sidelines. The film follows Sheen as he turns up as the new guy in town. Around the same time, a rather cool, yet ominous, black Dodge turns up too, and starts to beat the road pirates at their own game...I don't like Charlie Sheen much. He good in spoof comedies, but his presence just doesn't work in any other sort of movie because he's virtually impossible to take seriously. The fact that he's supposed to be 'the avenging angel' here represents a very silly casting mistake. The action isn't bad, and even the car chases are rather well filmed - the only problem is that once you've seen one, you've seen them all; making most of them difficult to enjoy. One thing I liked a lot about this film, however, was the trashy eighties soundtrack. Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol, Robert Palmer and others appear, and their music does go well with the trashy eighties plot line. Many people will probably like this movie because it is actually quite cool. The central car is awesome, and pretty much every teenager boy's (and some grown men's) dream car. Even the title, 'The Wraith' sounds ominous and cool - but unfortunately, and it is unfortunate, the plotting brings this eighties time capsule down. Not that I'm saying it's all bad - the film certainly has its moments; but I reckon that I wont be the only one disappointed.",The Wraith
18,Mr-Fusion,Needs more Sherilyn Fenn,4,20 February 2017,"""The Wraith"" starts out with some promise; a street race on a dark desert highway really sets up some nice '80s atmosphere. And this is a movie with Randy Quaid as a no-nonsense sheriff, Clint Howard in full ""Eraserhead"" coiffure and an array of gas-guzzling street racers. It's already somewhat bizarre and should have its own energy. Even the soundtrack is pretty good. But it doesn't live up to its potential, in any sense; the characters are thin, the pacing is all off and the stakes are nonexistent. At a certain point, I'd just wanted some more of those rock song car chases, which is exactly what this movie does right. Just not enough of 'em. 4/10",The Wraith

I asked myself and was about to stop this to Google it when one of the numerous movie expositions told me what it was. Oh, okay. Now, it all makes sense.It was to capitalize on Back to the Future's success a year earlier, Charlie Sheen's character from Ferris Bueller's Day Off from that year's summer and, well, 80s boobs'n'sci-fi. Well done.Actually, the only thing well-done was me hating this gang tremendously, some awesome racing POV's and making me regret living in Arizona. I guess I should be honored or flattered they targeted the Arizona desert towns/roads for this film's setting. Nope. The desert has always depressed me enormously and aside from the awesome racing segments, I was equally depressed seeing the backdrop of the dead desert behind the cars.I digress. Arizonian assholes obsess over the wrong cool cat and they mysteriously die one by one. Was it something they did in the past, and in the many unnecessary flashbacks, that causes their current predicament? The movie was totally 80s and very hard to watch for such incredibly goofy characters. I even got the impression they weren't acting. After all, the lead, Charlie Sheen, soon wouldn't be, either.***Final thoughts: You want a real Arizona horror? Or fun horror movie based in the 48th state? Send in the P's: Piranha 3D and Psycho. That's right: the ""Remake"" and the ""Original,"" respectively. Those do AZ right.",The Wraith
20,lost-in-limbo,Start those engines!,5,18 January 2007,"A small Arizona town is intimidated by a group of punk teens that like to drag race their done up cars against mostly pressured victims, along a empty stretch of a highway. If they lose, well these punks get to keep their car. The mysterious stranger Jake Kesey arrives in town and Packard Walsh the leader of the gang doesn't like how smitten he has become over 'his' girlfriend, Kerry Johnson. With the arrival of Jake, another unknown stranger has arrived in a black turbo Dodge Interceptor. This one seems to have a bone to pick with the group, and challenges them to races.You gotta love the 80s! As since this junky product is an essential taste of the no-bars, sledgehammer era. Saying that it's forgettable, and far from good, but this dumb, shallow fodder strangely passes the time. It pretty much reminded me of a teen variant of Clint Eastwood's semi-classic western ""High Plains Drifter"", but without the uneasy mystery and symbolic depth. This b-flick is a one-dimensional re-working of that a brilliant supernatural/revenge premise. Even a touch of ""The Crow"" and ""The Car"" make their way into the piece. What it becomes is an obviously plotted comic-book venture, where the blisteringly loud (who turned the volume up) rock soundtrack and adrenaline-packed car stunts take centre stage. Can anyone say music video. Its all about the cars and music. Brum, brum! There's plenty of juice here, no imagination though. The bizarre, though limp story doesn't generate a whole lot and under written plot devices clouds us with even more confusion. The banally barf-filled script is a sure misfire and Mike Marven's repetitively brisk direction is all over the place. Some stylishly atmospheric and potent images (the graveyard scene) show up, but he mostly handles it all in a basic manner that definitely lacks any sort of edge. What wasn't basic, were the pockets of brash camera-work that could have been part of the film's thunder. The special effects have that cheesy glow and are weak in spots, but the technical side is mostly well compensated and that goes for the explosions. The indifferent acting is over-the-top (the slimy Nick Cassavetes, a irritating David Sherrill, twitchy Clint Howard, and a wryly hard-hat Randy Quaid) or blatantly rigid (thankyou Charlie Sheen, as the curious Jake). Fitting somewhere smack in the middle is a delightfully smoking Sherilyn Fenn who gives the most well rounded turn.""The Wraith"" is a terribly flawed, but nice looking production from beyond the grave. Extremely mindless, yahoo entertainment for the very undemanding.",The Wraith
21,callanvass,"Fails to harness the vast potential it has, though it still manages to be enjoyably cheesy",5,5 January 2014,"Jamie Hankins (Charlie Sheen) is murdered by Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes) and the rest of his gang for getting too intimate with a girl he desires, Keri Johnson (Sherilyn Fenn) A mystical figure shows up without warning one day, a man who goes by the name of Jake Kesey. He has an invincible Dodge Turbo Interceptor, and hits it off with Kerri. People don't realize Jake is actually Jamie Hankins who has come back to avenge his death by killing Packard and his gang. I am half and half on this movie. I did enjoy this movie very much in a B-movie type way, but I also feel they failed to execute on the potentially riveting storyline. It doesn't do nearly enough with the set-up and resorts to playing it safe far too often. Jamie was a man who was murdered, and it sure didn't seem like he was that angry about it. We get scattered flashbacks of Jamie's death that don't really amount to much, nor do they provide much emotion. Jamie kills Packard's gang in the most routine ways imaginable, all by car chaos. As a matter of fact, that's all it was really interested in. It felt like it was bragging by saying ""Hey! Look at all these cool cars we are throwing your way, be in awe by it, and shut up"" You got murdered bro, go nuts! On that note, the cars are indeed cool. We get a dodge turbo, a firebird, corvette, among others. The car chases are certainly exciting, but it gets redundant after a while when the storyline really begins to lack proper substance. The visuals are pretty dated, but still pretty neat, especially those flying lights. The abundance of plot holes can't be ignored. Why was there no conjecturing that Jake was Jamie? How did it take the sheriff so long to figure out what was going on? Charlie Sheen doesn't exactly give his best performance in this one. He's one of my favorite actors, but I'd be lying if I said he wasn't somewhat wooden at times. He was far too cool for a precarious situation that his character was in. I would have loved to see him be more conflicted and emotional, but we can't always get what we want, now can we? it's still Charlie Sheen, and I love him. Sherilyn Fenn is awful as the love interest. She couldn't emote very well, but she was pretty easy on the eyes. Her love story with Sheen is supposed to be very potent, but it fell very flat. Nick Cassavetes gives the best performance in the film as a ruthless gang leader. His menacing performance was quite riveting. Randy Quaid is amusing as the tough sheriff. The rest of the cast range from good to adequate. MAJOR SPOILERS! Here are my thoughts on the anti-climatic ending. Jamie manages to kill Packard, and they gave the viewers a happy ending, but it's rather ambiguous as well. Kerri & Billy find out that Jake is Jamie, and Kerri & Billy ride off into the sunset together. Is Kerri gonna be dead as well, is Jamie gonna stay on earth? it left so many questions unanswered, and it wasn't very logical. Final Thoughts: I almost forgot the amazing soundtrack. It has some classic 80's songs, if you love the 80's like I do. This movie is very enjoyable for what it is. It's a corny B-movie, but it could have been so much more. It had potential to be a suspenseful revenge film, but wound up being a cheesy 80's film. I can't complain too much. Cheesy 80's is just fine with me. Well worth a look, just make sure you temper your expectations5.7/10",The Wraith
22,paulclaassen,Now that's entertainment!,6,15 September 2021,"'The Wraith' is an interesting blend of fantasy, action, drama, romance and even a bit of horror, while at the same time being a vengeance movie. This classic 80s movie made the futuristic car, a Dodge M4S, a household name at the time of release.Interesting also how some elements in the film are so familiar with the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise, which almost makes me believe the writers of the original 'Fast and the Furious' based their film on 'The Wraith'. Could this indeed have been the inspiration?'The Wraith' features amazing cars and fast-paced, impressive action sequences. This will no doubt be a feast for car enthusiasts. I also enjoyed the characters and the premise in general. Charlie Sheen stars as the film's protagonist, Jake. A mysterious character at first, we learn a lot about Jake through flashbacks. Nick Cassavetes stars as the antagonist, Packard, who is possessive over Keri (Sherilyn Fenn). Keri is a strong character and the only person in town who is not scared to stand up to Packard. Randy Quaid is well cast as Sheriff Loomis, who also takes a stand against Packard and his gang.'The Wraith' is very well made for its time. Even by today's standards, the film delivers more than enough thrills and excitement to keep the viewer engaged. It also offers a great climax on a physical and emotional level. This is a darn good movie!",The Wraith
23,sol-,High Plains Drag Racer,4,7 October 2016,"Evidence points towards a teen stranger being the same person responsible for killing local thugs during dangerous drag races in this uncredited remake of 'High Plains Drifter'. On paper, it sounds quite promising, updating the classic western story to modern times with cars instead of horses and the drag races (full of point-of-view shots) are admittedly exciting. The screenplay is rather incoherent though with no explanation for how the protagonist has returned or the origins of his supernatural gadgetry. In fact, a key difference between 'High Plains Drifter' and 'The Wraith' is that the latter film makes it glaringly obvious that something supernatural is up from Scene 1, whereas the 1973 film only slowly reveals its twists. The supernatural element consequently weighs more heavily here and the lack of explanation is more bothersome. There is also the fact that Eastwood's character gradually humiliates and perplexes the townsfolk before taking revenge; here, revenge comes too soon. The baddies are also vile that there is no reason to root for them even without knowing of their checkered past; they are such brainless scum that the film treads no ethical ground when offing them. The film is additionally beset by a blaring song soundtrack, and yet 'The Wraith' is reasonably watchable for such a heavily flawed project. The seemingly driverless, darkly tinted supernatural car is a wonder to behold, the drag races are well filmed and the movie features some great locales and vistas considering that the only place to socialise in town appears to be the local hamburger joint!",The Wraith
24,digitalbeachbum,100% cult film,8,13 February 2016,"Released in 1986 I watched this movie on Cinemax a thousand times. Back then I thought it was the best, today it is even better for different reasons.This movie has 80's music such as Ozzy Ozborne, Ian Hunter, Honeymoon Suite, Robert Palmer, Motley Crue, Billy Idol, Lion and Bonnie Tyler. It has a very young Charlie Sheen, and a very hot, very young, Sherilyn Fenn, a sane Randy Quaid and even an appearance from Clint Howard (Ron Howard's brother), dozens of classic one liners, 80's muscle cars including a Dodge MS4 prototype car.This movie epitomizes the 80's. It is with out hesitation a movie which serves as a historical bookmark for the era of big hair, cheesy dialog and male chauvinistic point of views towards women and undertones of anti-gay views. There are dozens of big car crashes ending in a ball of fire over cliffs.No spoilers here, but the story in basic terms is about revenge. A ghost or wraith (the anti-hero) comes back to seek revenge for the murder of a young man who was in love with a beautiful young girl. The antagonist is the one who steals and dominates every one and every thing in his line of vision, including the love interest.The filming location is out in the Arizona desert which is typical for the 80's. The desert offered a cheap set location and with out much need for dealing with big town politics. Most of the scenes take place at junkyards, a burger joint or on the road.The script is actually very well written. The direction and acting is also actually acceptable. The movie keeps moving with a lot of action. Aside from some minor goofs the movie is practically flawless and filled with hidden classic literary clichés, such as the graveyard scene or the brief glimpse when the wraith's visor opens.There is some language and minor topless nudity. A few dead bodies with eyes burned out. The rest of the movie is filled with bullying and car chases.Overall the movie holds up even after thirty-five years of being lost on the shelf. Recently Hulu started to air it and I'm suspecting that it will show up on Netflix soon. It is worth a watch and remember it is a sleeper cult flick. Try not to expect any thing at all from the movie and watch it with out forwarding through it.(extra)

The movie that rides on too little, is a simple revenge tale about a wraith (ghost) apparently a car that Sheen is driving that picks off our baddies, the first one being Ryan O Neal's son. It can vanish like that or suddenly appear, but it does exist. Thick haired, Nick Cassavetes, a very versatile actor, is just the guy you need to play the head baddie, Packard Walsh, and he does it well, while the one goofy looking guy, with the glasses, I'll never forget. Packard likes to race people for their cars, even if the drivers are disinclined. One driver had got fresh with his girl, so he killed him, in a quite nasty scene, hence the revenge, that follows in the mysterious form of Sheen. Hot property, Sherilyn Fenn, one of the film's attributes, especially in red bikini wear, catches the eye of Sheen, the new kind of dorky boy, in town. Worked it out yet, yeah, she's Cassavete's girl, so that really doesn't really sit well with him, so now I've guessed you'd made out the climax. Sorry. Even though there's not much that makes up the film, that watching these faded stars, early in the prime, is enough to carry it along, but that's all it is, an unimpressive yet well acted time passer.

Sheen plays Jake, a teenager who rides a dirt bike in an Arizona town meets a lovely girl who works at a drive-in burger joint with the brother(Matthew Barry) of a murdered man.

They could have been blown away by the explosion, but when the fire is put out, the bodies are there except for the eyes.
Fast cars are a factor in this movie, the Chrysler/Dodge company were a big impact on making the film. The Dodge Shelby and the Pace car was the most amazing thing ever in the movie.
The language was rough, and the love scenes made me wonder which was the rating of the film. Not hard enough for a solid ""R"" rating. It's rather mild.

The storyline follows a small town with a checkered past and whose roads are filled with street racers. An intergalactic presence arrives for what seems like revenge on the street racers. What did the gang do to go from the hunters to the hunted? This movie is directed by Mike Marvin (Sun Storm) and stars Charlie Sheen (Wall Street), Nick Cassavetes (Face/Off), Randy Quaid (Christmas Vacation) and Sherilyn Fenn (Wild at Heart). This movie is better than any of the Fast and Furious pictures. The cars are awesome and I loved the entire cast. Quaid was hilarious as the sheriff. The characters good and bad were both entertaining. Clint Howard (The Waterboy) was a fun character in this also. The storyline is unique and a nice blend of science fiction and street car killing, in a Deathrace 2000 kind of way. Overall this is an underrated gem that combines 70s grindhouse with 80s characters. I'd score this a 9.5/10 and strongly recommend.",The Wraith

As I grew older, I would always try to catch it when it was on T.V. but a lot of the time, I couldn't.  Now after finally buying I could finally watch the film in its entirety.One night, a kid named Jamie was caught making love to a girl.  All of a sudden, a gang of punks, led by the fearsome Packard(Nick Cassavetes), bust in and they beat up and finally killing Jamie.  Now a year after his death, a kid named Jake(Charlie Sheen in a pre-stardom role) mysteriously rolls into town on a bike.  He immediately starts a friendship with a kid named Billy, who works at the local burger joint. When Jake begins hitting on Keri(Sherilyn Fenn), who also happens to be Packard's girlfriend.  Soon after, a mysterious car, the incredibly rare Turbo Interceptor, rolls up and challenges one the gang members to a race. As the race draws to a close, the gang member crashes and has a fiery death. One by one each of the gang members meet with lots of gruesome deaths.  I won't go any further than that.This movie is totally underrated.  I'm surprised it hasn't gotten much attention over the last 16 years.  You'd think it would, even with Charlie Sheen in it.I especially like some of the performances, mainly the two gang members Skank and Gutterboy.  You can easily tell they are the comic relief in this movie.  Seeing Skank get high off of anti-freeze is absolutely hilarious. 
Now to get to what I think is the prize of this film: The Turbo Interceptor. From what I read somewhere, only six were ever made, hence making it probably one of the rarest cars ever brought into existence.

""The Wraith"" is a strange, strange flick...coming from an era before Charlie Sheen, Nick Cassavetes, and Sherilyn Fenn went on to better things (no, wait, scratch that), thus making their presence here more easily forgivable. Not that this is a bad movie--it's actually quite entertaining in its own tweakin' way, even if it only appeals to the basest aesthetic pleasures in the viewer. Far-out car chases/crashes? Check. Randy Quaid as the sheriff, with some deliciously offbeat dialog? Check. Clint Howard as an ""Eraserhead"" doppleganger? Check. Scenes cued with unforgettably bad '80s metal? Double check. The skimpy plot has something to do with the revived spirit of a murdered teen coming back for revenge against those who killed him; the evil gang members have a sometimes-overdone cartoon quality that wears thin as the film progresses.

33,PredragReviews,"""You lose the race; you lose your car!""",7,15 May 2016,"The movie starring a young Charlie Sheen from the nineteen eighties was a very impressive piece of work for its time. It was one of the first movies to use computer enhancement. And to this day, the car that the ""Wraith"" dove in this flick would be considered bad to the bone, and would fit in impressively on some rich Californian coast boulevard! The acting was better than average for the time and budget allotted to do the film. The movie is solid and its about a group of kids that scare the towns people. The bully and even kill people and one kid comes back to kill the ones that killed him. Within one weeks time he kills all of them with this car. The special effects are great but it's those characters that make the film.Featuring a terrific driving musical score from musical legends of the era like Billy Idol, Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, The Wraith is a movie that epitomizes the old Sicilian mafioso adage that ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"". But it is also a love story that transcends death with the apparent help of some friendly extraterrestrials that provide the murdered young man with resurrection and some really awesome and deadly hardware. And the most impressive piece of this deadly hardware of course is the superb, jet black Dodge Turbo Interceptor which may be the real star of the show. This was a concept car originally built by Dodge to be used as a pace car on the 1981 Indy Car World Series racing circuit. All in all, it's a great and entertaining movie with terrific race scenes and good character development for all the principal characters as well as the major supporting characters.

I mean, in pretty much every horror movie ever made, you have normal people doing implausibly stupid things in order to get themselves killed. Here we get complete and utter morons doing stupid things, which is more realistic yet still pretty goddamn annoying. The biggest downer though is that our killer never even leaves his car to kill anyone, in fact he always does the exact same thing. The only way you are safe is when you don't try to race him, which for these people is absolutely impossible to do. Two people have already died mysteriously while racing you, so let's race.

You wouldn't think it though as the start of the movie feels more like the arrival of an alien being more than anything. Anyway, REALLY not too sure why he doesn't just come back and simply shoot them or whatever, but the gang are street racers themselves so I guess that explains it, kinda.So yes, the plot of this movie is your typical revenge thriller. Your typical supernatural tale of an innocent person coming back from the dead to avenge their untimely death at the hands of some baddies. But it is indeed strikingly similar to the bird-related graphic novel that sprouted from the brain of one James O'Barr that's for sure. One has a heavy rock theme whilst the other a heavy car theme. The genesis of O'Barr's supernatural tale started way back in 1981, with the graphic novel eventually coming out in 1989, and finally followed by the movie in 1994. Of course the similar plots could just be coincidental, but it does get you thinking.Anyway, as I said the very start of this movie is hella cheesy and looks more like the introduction of an alien being landing on a deserted desert highway, in a souped-up car. The effects are of course incredibly 80's lookin', naturally, but boy do they look good. Think of the speedy visuals from 'Tron' but set against a silvery full moon in a desert and finishing with a reveal shot of the mysterious hero clad in an all-black with a racing helmet. The whole sequence is gloriously goofy yet at the same time the epitome of retro coolness.The Baddies: Now these dudes are a small bunch of (five) young guys, probably in their early 20's, led by one much older guy named Packard (Nick Cassavetes). Not sure if he was actually supposed to be older or that was just down to the fact they cast Cassavetes as a young man in his early 20's when he clearly wasn't. Anyway these guys are, again, the epitome of the classic 80's gang. Nick the leader is a bit of a greaser with his hairstyle and black leather jacket. Whilst his young henchmen are a mix of drugged up punks, weasely rats, and your cliched high school bully type all with silly names. It's an odd blend really because Nick is shown to be quite mentally unhinged and perfectly happy to actually kill people. Whilst his cronies are often more light-hearted, acting as comedic relief being all goofy and dumb. Clint Howard (who looks too old for the part) plays the brains behind the gangs car mods and sports a weird haircut that's straight outta the 1977 film 'Eraserhead'.The bad guys are an interesting bunch. They mostly seem to be young adults that don't appear to do anything of use. Yet they seem to own this huge garage chock full of mechanical equipment for maintaining cars. We know they take part in crime, petty and serious. And we know they force people to race their souped-up cars and keep them when they win (by cheating). But we only see two of them with some kind of manual labour job, whilst Packard does nothing accept cruise around lookin' for fights, races, and watching his girl. So how do they afford to keep this large garage with all its gear? Do they actually run a service for people? Or do they fix up their victory cars and sell them? How have they not been busted by the cops yet??The Girl: I did find it amusing that the sweet innocent girlfriend of Packard (Keri played by Sherilyn Fenn) actually continues to go out with him despite the fact he's clearly bad news. Don't get me wrong she knows he's bad news but never really seems too upset over it. She lodges some complaints here and there sure but she never really goes for it. The fact that he constantly threatens her and claims he owns her should really be an alarm bell to get the hell outta that relationship; nah she just protests a bit then carries on. I was like, girl go to the police for God's sake.The Hero: So Packard and his mates killed this poor kid Jake (Charlie Sheen). Luckily he comes back as a supernatural force to take revenge...in a supernatural super-powered car. Again don't get me wrong its a super cool concept but...really? Like why does he need the car? If you're able to come back from the dead (or given the powers to do so by a greater force), you don't need a supercar surely. Anyway we know this is just an excuse for fast car racin'. The bad guys steal and race cars so the only way to beat them is race them, apparently. Jake is decked out in an all-black tinted helmet with an all-black jumpsuit which is covered in metal parts which represent other victims. I didn't quite get this, were these parts supposed to represent former victims of Packard's gang?Another thing I didn't get was what Jake was supposed to be. For starters he comes back from the dead in a different body, he says it was the closest to what he used to look like. But what's going on with that? Why doesn't he come back in his original form/body? Who's body does he come with? Next up, is Jake a ghost or not? At the end Jake and Keri leave town together to start afresh. But is Jake actually alive? Is he a rotting corpse? A ghost? Reborn completely?? Immortal? Invincible?The Car: The car in question was a Dodge M4S Turbo Interceptor. A high-performance supercar designed and built in 1981for demonstration purposes. It most definitely looks the biz in this that's for sure. All black, completely tinted all round, low to the ground, and with a very sleek curvy aerodynamic spaceship design. The car is very effective throughout the movie (much like the DeLorean was for 'Back to the Future') and certainly emits a mysterious, dangerous and speedy quality. Alas the actual races we get are clearly filmed at low speeds which spoils the fun but the sight of this car lining up against some other classic all-American muscle cars is a sight to behold (for petrolheads anyway).Another aspect the movie seems to hint at is the fact that Packard knows of The Wraith (never called that in the movie I think). When Jake turns up at their garage (in his all-black attire) and shoots up the place, Packard acts as if this has happened before. He doesn't actually seem particularly scared either, as if he's seen this black-clad vigilante before. All in all Packard is as cool as a cucumber when you'd think he'd be terrified like the other guys. So it kinda seems there's a history here which is odd because Jake only turns up in the area at the start of the movie so...what's going on here?This movie really is the quintessential naff 80's action flick. It has all the ingredients from the wacky villains to the wicked cars to the plot that really doesn't add up when you think about it. But somehow none of that really matters. The supernatural element isn't really that spooky or tense or anything, it's just quirky and fun. The special effects are actually pretty solid. The race and crash sequences are fairly well done in a Saturday morning cartoon kinda way ('Pole Position'). Sheen's lifeless performance is odd but Cassavetes and his henchmen are clearly enjoying themselves while they chew up the scenery. Whilst Randy Quaid as the local sheriff pretty much plays a character we've seen him do before. If you like comicbook type flicks then you'll like this. In fact it does feel like an update of a 30's pulp comic character, kinda. Highly enjoyable fast food trash.7/10",The Wraith

In some ways though, it actually reminds me of other film genres: the car showdowns have a certain Western ""shootout"" quality to them, especially the final race; the pursuit of the villains picking them off one by one has the ring of the slasher film about it even if the method doesn't involve any actual slashing here. The beyond goofy punks, the spacesuit wearing, Darth Vader-like breathing of the Wraith gives this some of those so bad it's almost good moments. In the end, while there's certainly nothing that requires one to think here, I cannot help but like this film.

43,stevenrotherforth,Petrol and cheese go together nicely,6,3 April 2019,"The WraithIf you're feeling peckish for a little eighties cheese then The Wraith should satisfy you're appetite.
Throw in a healthy portion of nostalgia and anyone who grew up in the decade of Duran Duran and Spandex should have a blast with this movie.
Sure if we look at this film with modern eyes then this is cringeworthy.
But then again it's no more ludicrous than what the Fast and Furious franchise has become.
If you think of The Wraith as a mashup of the aforementioned Fast and Furious, Knightrider, The Crow and Footloose then you're on the right desert highway.
Released in 1986 this movie has disappeared from the public's consciousness.
Starring a very young Charlie Sheen The Wraith tells the story of a mysterious stranger that turns up in a small desert town. At the same time an even more mysterious hyper car shows up. It's elusive driver challenges a group of marauding street racers and kills them one by one.
Yep it's a ludicrous premise but if you're a petrolhead or a fan of all things 80's then I think you'll put aside the fact that the story makes absolutely no sense.
The plot has more loose ends than a shoestring factory and it's so poorly edited that continuity is something that is completely neglected by director Mike Marvin.
As the film wraps there's plenty of questions that never get answered and it's apparent that The Wraith is clumsy and terribly put together.
However if you accept this and make allowances for the films amateurish production it is an enjoyable film.
Reminiscent of many low budget action movies from this era. Mad Max springs to mind as does TV shows such as Street Hawk and Airwolf.The soundtrack is a smothering of 80's synth rock cheese.
The opening track ""Where's the fire"" by Tim Feehan is one of those songs that belongs on a mix tape along with such 80's classics as ""Eye of the Tiger,Saint Elmo's fire""or even Starships ""Nothings gonna stop us now.""
It's all a bit Kenny Loggins but what's wrong with that?
This is what we want from our eighties movies and The Wraith delivers.
There's the generic nasty villain played by Nick Cassavettes.
There's the hero (Charlie Sheen) and his cool car, there's the mandatory love interest played by the gorgeous Sherilyn Fenn.
There's the comic relief headed by Clint Howard and Randy Quaid.
In terms of 80's cheesefest success this movie has all the key ingredients but some how managed to flop and disappear from moviegoers memories.
A shame really as after all it mostly succeeds in what it tries to achieve.

Yes it's '80s soundtrack is cheesy, and the acting is b-movie quality but the special effects were pretty nifty for an '80s movie. If they focused more on the film further, this could've been pretty good action flick. Well, it has to be settled for that though there is a fair amount of T&A which satisfies the fantasies of males( in retrospect, the girls are much healthy looking than, you know, nowadays). The best scenes in the movie are the races which lead to a fiery death and the verbal joust between Jamie's girlfriend and the gang leader near the end. The final duel at the end was quite suspenseful but underwhelming. Not good or bad but something to watch on a boring summer afternoon when there is nothing else on.

This, of course, means that you'll have to endure a few eighties quirks, which gave the decade its unique character.""The Wraith"" is a creative story about a bunch of drag-racing town bullies who are into taking what they wish, mostly by force. The town police (although shown as macho) appear feckless in apprehending the thugs. The town's populus remain largely actionless due to their fear. The kingpin of these hooligans is Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes - son of famous actor John Cassavetes). Charlie Sheen plays Jake, the reincarnation of a slain victim (Jamie) of the town thugs. He appears out of nowhere and soon begins conversations with Packard Walsh's girlfriend, an action considered lethal. Soon a mysterious driver with an exotic, futuristic-looking car (the real-life Dodge-Chrysler Interceptor M4S) appears on the scene and begins drag-racing Packard's gang into the grave.This film gives us some great eighties in it's soundtrack which includes Robert Palmer and Billy Idol. It also gives a look at the popular ""punk"" look of the eighties in the character of Skank. I recently discovered that the Wraith's car was a real-life automobile. And only one original model was actually loaned from Chrysler. The other shots were of ""shell"" models, without engines, etc. During the filming of the good drag-race shots on the mountainsides outside of Tuscon, one of the crew members was killed and another critically wounded.I had some dislike for the film in the completely idiotic and helpless nature of Packard's thugs. In fact, I had a bit of trouble in believing the entire town's pacifisim towards Packard. There is one strange scene involving a sexual encounter between Packard and some local girl, where she thanks the sheriff for showing up. This just didn't add any credibility. But then again the whole movie is a bit incredible, especially the Wraith's car and its ability to keep that Windex shine after blowing up. And I never did figure out what the deal was with that one part that glowed at the end of every crash. More 80's sfx...? I chuckled for an instant though when I saw the Wraith enter Packard's warehouse in that ""spacesuit"" with what appeared to be a ""space shotgun"". What was the deal with that? I was beginning to think Jake's body was beamed aboard an alien ship before he died and now he was returning with their technology.A good story for the eighties, but not one to take too seriously. Be sure to admire Sherilyn Fenn's teeny character, Keri. Oh, I also read you can buy an M4S Interceptor replica for about $70,000. Ouch! 6/10",The Wraith
50,Idiot-Deluxe,"""Teen-Knight Rider"" with romantic angle + Charlie Sheen.",5,8 November 2016,"""Bad feelin's don't add up to resurrections buddy."" Well this movie is simply pure-80's cheese of high thoroughbred and for the most part, is fast-paced and highly entertaining. 1986's ""The Wraith"" has a lot going on it: It's part action, with all it's road racing/car fires and shoot em' up sequences, it's part comedy due to a small gaggle of quirky and colorful gang members and it has romance with the Keri-factor, which heavily influences the story. Yes this movie, is quite a riot and very entertaining, rarely is it slow at any point, it's also on ""the bleeding edge of hi-tech"" due to Charlie's killer wheel's (the REAL star of the movie), plus, his special super-suit complete with full-helmet and dark visor and his magical shotgun, that never needs to be reloaded (I counted over 40 shots! in one scene!) - when all three of these things are working cooperatively, there's simply no stopping Charlie Sheen from getting his revenge; because that's really what The Wraith is all about, Revenge.Undoubtedly one of Charlie Sheen's earliest films, (released just one month before Platoon, a much better movie and winner of Best Picture) in the role of ""Jake"" a jean-jacket and sunglasses-wearing cool-guy who rides around on a dirt-bike, but really that's just one of his identities. A young Sherilyn Flynn is the ""pretty local girl"" and in this film she's constantly fought over, by multiple, horny, teen-suitor's - ""Jake"" and the psychopathic gang-leader ""Packard"". Packard is the leader of a gang of road-racers/car-thieves who prowl the Arizona highways, looking for hot new wheels to, first race, then steal. They hole-up in their hide-out, a large barn out in the desert, which is 1-part house and 1-part auto-body shop, which is absolutely brimming with auto-mechanical equipment, as this gang is always wrenchin' on and tweakin' their rides, in an effort to maintain their edge over the ""hot rides"" they race (and ultimately steal) in the desert.Also in The Wraith stars a youngish Randy Quaid in the role of Sheriff G.L. Loomis, who's intent on solving the mystery behind ""the black turbo"" that's been up to no good, in his eyes at least, out on the desert roads - as the body count keeps rising. My favorite characters in this colorful bit of mid-80's misadventure is Packard's henchmen, Skank, Gutterboy and Rughead - these three are simply a riot, especially Skank. Skank's this hilarious blonde-headed mohawk and make-up wearing punk, who's also a junkie, a mechanic and just an overall scoundrel, who's always up to no good, probably the movies most colorful character. If you listen, you'll notice that this movie packs a substantial amount of slang, primarily heard from Loomis, Skank and Gutterboy, of which some of it is certainly hard to make out, but always colorful and simply flat-out ridiculous. Yes this movies no stranger to corny dialog.One of the high-lights of The Wraith is all the great road racing footage, which is always between two sports cars (with the exception of one scene), roaring down winding, sun-baked, desert roads; the photography and editing of these sequences really make them pop and are quite intense. Also there are some pretty decent visual effects seen off and on throughout the film, which for being a 30 year old film with only a modest budget, have aged surprisingly well all things considered. And with the angle of the super hi-tech car or ""black-turbo"" as it's known, that's where the Knight Rider similarities undeniably come into play and as iconic as Kit is, Charlie's car, in more ways then not, has Kit beat - sorry Knight Rider fans. Also, seeing as how most of The Wraith's cast are either in their teens or early 20's, serves only to increase the feel, that what you are watching is really: Teen-Knight Rider - made for the silver screen.If you watch attentively you'll notice that The Wraith really has a little bit of everything in it, including reincarnation. But I won't say any more about that, because, as it turns out, that's the whole movie right there. And though The Wraith is a fairly violent movie, it also somehow has the ability to remain light-hearted at the same time. Figure that out if you can. You can simply chalk it up to movie magic I guess.To rehash: Fun 80's teen sci-fi, with romance, a pinch of T & A, lot's of cool cars and gasoline fires, plus the film is breathlessly pushed forward by a near-constantly blaring soundtrack, that's utterly LOADED to the gills, with tasteless, radio-friendly tunes, comprised exclusively of 80's rock and hair-metal selections.Note* The Wraith would be absolutely perfect as a double feature, following Maximum Overdrive.",The Wraith
51,metalrox_2000,An excellent telling of camp fire tale,10,11 November 2010,"It amazing at how the film moves along, doesn't get sidetracked, and presents a very interesting camp fire style story.The film is centers around the arrival in town of Jake.

The challenge is on, and gang member Augie Fisher is more than happy to take him on.Instead, Augie becomes the first victim, because they aren't racing your average driver.

However, the Wraith doesn't kill Rughead, since Rughead had nothing to do with his murder.The wraith finds Packard, standing with a knife, ready to kill Keri. The Wraith challenges Packard to a race.

He is in fact Jamie Hankins, and has returned so that he and Keri could be together.

52,blurnieghey,"Don't ""Wraithste"" Your Time",2,19 July 2020,"As much as I harp about how bad movies are these days, it doesn't hurt to have a reminder that there were plenty of soulless, corporate crap movies from my era to hate on, as well, and The Wraith is one of them. The year is 1986 and during this period a lot of TV shows and movies were employing this technique of making everything into a rock video, courtesy of the TV show Miami Vice that stumbled upon the concept a couple years prior. The result was by 1986 it seemed like over half the movies and TV shows that were getting cranked out were double-dipping with the music industry to foist their Top 40 crapola into the visual entertainment market. I suppose, if you were a person who actually liked this music, you would have thought it was nifty that companies were doing this, but there were plenty of us who hated it. I was one of them. Also, would it be fair to say that Plymouth forked over a few bucks for this thing? Seriously, I remember the 80's like it was yesterday but I never saw a cop driving a K-Car! And you see the logo repeatedly throughout the film. This is a movie designed from a blatantly crass corporate perspective to be consumed by a ""youth culture"" that they also attempted to design and if a vacuum cleaner company or a maker of feminine pads had wanted a slice of the pie at the time, you can bet those products would have been stuck in the film somewhere, as well.However, as if the hamfisted music and product placement wasn't bad enough, the story is total nonsense. It is the tale of some kid named Jamie who gets murdered and comes back as a guy named ""Jake"" to get revenge and, for some reason that is never explained, his reincarnation involves him dressing like a space alien, having supernatural powers, and driving a super-car. The bad guys that ""Jake"" has to fight are completely ridiculous. For some reason they are able to just go around taking the titles of people's vehicles in phony ""races"" with no repercussions and get away with murder and assault with no police interference what-so-ever. Also, there appears to be no traffic in the town (Tucson?) and surrounding areas, freeing them up to drive around as fast as they want and fire off shotguns in the city limits, again with no police interference. At the end of the movie, the female love-object isn't phased one bit by the fact that the bad guy killed her ex-boyfriend, nor is she the least bit phased when ""Jake"" reveals himself to be Jamie after transforming from alien to human right in front of her eyes and then decides to run off with him to wherever at the drop of a hat. However, before she runs off, Jake decides to give his super-car (presumably with no title, seeing as it's from outer space) to his brother, never mind that it was involved in multiple homicides and is wanted by the police. Randy Quaid overacts and all the other characters recite their lines like the are reading off a teleprompter. There's plenty more wrong with this mess, but you get the picture.All that aside, I'm giving it two stars: one for the nostalgia and love-to-hate cheesiness of the whole affair and the other for the pointless nudity that they saw fit to inject for no good reason.

56,Celluloid_Fiend,A Spirit Of Vengeance That Burns Up The Highways!,7,13 October 2019,"This film is the epitome of 80's cheesiness. You've got fast cars, hot chicks, a revenge-fueled plot and Clint Howard (with one of the funniest hairdos ever). Yet, the film has a certain charm that makes you kind of enjoy the spectacle of it all.Charlie Sheen plays the lead hero, bent on getting back at the gang who murdered him. That's pretty much as far as the script goes, as far as advancing any kind of plot. This of course, leaves many unanswered questions, as a result. Why is Sheen's character given this second chance for revenge? Why race each gang member separately, when he could kill them all at once? Where are all the adults (save the sheriff, played by Randy Quaid)? Why are the police so inept at stopping things, when they know who the street-racing punks are? It seems providing such answers was never a big priority, as most of the film is spent with cars racing (and blowing up), or Sheen's character reconnecting with his old girlfriend. It is obvious that this film is trying to appeal to the 16-20 year old crowd (and adults who still think like them).Sherilyn Fenn, who plays said girlfriend, provides the prerequisite nudity and damsel in distress required for the story, while Nick Cassavetes is equally adequate as the slimy and somewhat unstable gang leader. Most of the performances are very stiff and wooden, with little in the way of any realistic dialog or emotion. Very typical of an 80's schlock affair, such as this.The two areas the film does excel in, however, are the car races and the soundtrack. The cinematography of the cars battling for the dominance of speed are very well done. It is about the only part of the film that will inspire any thrills, which shouldn't be surprising, as some of the crew were killed during the making of some of those scenes. Then, of course, the soundtrack is simply rocking, with some of the biggest metal bands and artists providing that trashy 80's sound. The races and music help the film to keep the pace moving fast, which is probably for the best, as it helps make it more enjoyable and keeps you from focusing on the lack of plot and acting ability.In the final analysis, ""The Wraith"" is simply a blend of the average revenge-fantasy and the superficial coolness of youth. Think ""Death Race 2000"" meets ""Death Wish,"" only with an 80's vibe. It's actually pretty harmless fun, if you allow yourself to simply give in to the sheer inanity of the premise and don't expect everything to make sense.

58,rcoates-661-22249,High Plains Driver,8,16 March 2010,"Essentially a revved-up sci-fi version of High Plains Drifter with 80s teens and the cute young spirit of vengeance driving the Mad Max Interceptor instead of riding into town on a horse, The Wraith is one I've remembered fondly since first seeing it on Monstervision with Joe Bob Briggs in the 90s.The story is, as other reviewers have noted, pretty hopelessly stupid, with dialogue alternating between bland and quotably goofy. Sheen, though top-billed, has little to do and isn't particularly charismatic when he's on screen. Consequently, the Wraith experience is all about the superficial elements: slick car action, hot 80s pop, eye-pleasing girls, etc. Also noteworthy, however, is the colorful supporting cast, including Randy Quaid as the sheriff, and scene-stealing comic relief cretins Skank, Gutterboy, and Rughead (the eternally fascinating Clint Howard sporting an Eraserhead 'do).It's amusing to see the wild array of user reactions to The Wraith, ranging from exaggeratedly laudatory (""Sheen's Post-Impressionist Masterpiece"", whatever that means) to dismissive (""Really bad 80's cheese"") to indignantly blunt (""crap!!""). It really depends on how you feel about the wacky decade that unleashed The Wraith, a disposable 80s trash flick par excellence. All you need to know is that this movie is 80s to the max. I might be disposed to dismiss The Wraith as time-wasting crap, myself, if it weren't for the fact that it's such utterly fun and nostalgically classic crap.",The Wraith

They almost stole the movie from Charlie Sheen. Charlie and Keri (lead boy and girl) were well cast. It was a toss-up who was the prettier of the two. While watching I thought Keri amazingly sexy and wondered if she was some Playboy Centerfold who won a part in a small movie. (check out her biography on IMDb, she WAS a bunny at one time). Every outfit she had was absolutely cute and hot looking. The cars were cool and it was fun watching them race. Two bloopers I caught were when Skank and Gutterhead had a shotgun. They kept talking about putting ""bullets"" in the shotgun. You would think scriptwriters knew that you put shotgun SHELLS in a shotgun, not bullets. Bullets go in a gun. Also, I had to look up Cassavetes birthplace. For 99% of the movie he speaks ""standard American English"" (no identifiable accent). But one scene where he is in his bad guy garage, and Randy Quaid approaches him, he slips into some kind of New York/New Jersey accent. See if you can catch it, it's only a few lines but he gives away his birthplace. I looked him up on the IMDb and he's from New York. Randy Quaid is perfectly cast, as usual.

Set to an awesome soundtrack with some out of this world (pun intended) race scenes, this movie was such a blast. When re-watching it now you only realize Charlie Sheen is really not in the movie that much, but that's fine.The movie is more or less driven (pun not intended) by a young Nick Cassavettes playing the role of Packard Walsh and his angry, abusive, possessive urge to control his girlfriend and her every move, only to encounter a strange car (and even stranger driver) hell-bent on racing every member of Packard's gang until Packard has no choice but to race him one on one.If you appreciate 80's rock and adrenaline-pumping races and supernatural ghost stories, then check this film out.

Westwood in LA '86 was a great time.The movie left an indelible mark on me from the moment I walked out I was a changed man, er boy. I had just seen the coolest most bitchin' movie ever!Charlie Sheen in his first staring role plays a new kid in a small town in the Arizona desert town that is held hostage by a group of road pirates that race people for their pink slips. This group led by Packard (Nick Cassavetes) is a motley crew if I ever saw one filled with every stereotypical character you can find. Packard and Sheen are both into the same girl (Sherrilyn Fenn) and that is where the fun starts.The gang of thugs are being taken out one by one by a masked avenger of sorts in a supernaturally cool car that forces you to hit it and blow up while it re-appears without a scratch. Of course law enforcement is called in and it falls to Sheriff Loomis (Randy Quaid) always one step behind the action right where we need him.Awesome driving sequences showing the same scenery over and over and a shoestring budget give this movie more character than you would normally have but everything is up on the screen to watch. The music is pretty good for 80's rock tunes and it is such a perfect little time capsule for the era in which it was produced.If you want a fun movie to watch on a Saturday night maybe some beer and pizza a some friends to revel in the greatest time in cinema ( I am joking by the way) you can't go wrong.It's schlocky, weird and makes little sense, the acting is pitch perfect for the material and is just a good time.

A young Charile Sheen stars as the wraith who rides into town in his mysterious ""Turbo Interceptor"" and takes revenge on a gang of no good road pirates. The Turbo Interceptor was way ahead of its time when the movie was filmed but now seems a bit cheap. The car racing sequences were pretty well shot and still stand up today.The Wraith features a rockin' 80s soundtrack with music performed by Bily Idol, Robert Palmer, Motley Crue and even Ozzy Osbuorne. Randy Quaid, Clint Howard and Nick Cassavetes round out a cast of strange supporting actors. A very young Brooke Burke makes an appearance as a car-hop at Big Kay Burgers and Steven Eckholdt also has a small part as the ""Daytona Boy."" Though the Wraith is filled with terrible acting and the special effects are dated, it is still a fun ride. The Turbo Interceptor's ""special feature"" is still unbelievable and a lot of fun even after all these years.If you're a big fan of the Mad Max/Road Warrior films or of street racing movies like The Fast and the Furious, I think you'll really like this movie. You may have to be a big car enthusiast or a big Charlie Sheen fan to really love this film. The Wraith is rated PG-13 though it does contain some mild violence and partial nudity/sexuality.

Visually it is passable though much of the lighting and staging makes most of it look (if it wasn't actually) look like it's in a sound stage. There are scenes which a very over-lit and some of the framing is unnecessarily close.The acting is boring from basically everyone involved. Clint Howard puts in regular oddball character which, if not too familiar lends something unique. Randy Quaid wanders in and out of scenes in a virtually pointless role which is delivered with a frustrating lack of commitment. Charlie Sheen turns what could have been a screaming passion driven cry for revenge into an old dry declaration of annoyance someone wrote on the back of a napkin and left in the bottom of a draw and later found when they were in their 50's.Barely watchable to the end and not engaging.",The Wraith
72,somme22,The Wraith is a fun thrill ride through the 1980s.,10,18 October 2005,"The Wraith is the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday night. The film is much more than the amazing cars and the great 80s soundtrack. The Wraith is a film that centers on the arrival of a new guy in town-Jake Keesey (played by Charlie Sheen). His arrival will disrupt the activities of Packard Walsh's gang of car thieves. Almost at the same time as Jake's arrival, a new car roars into the lives of Packard and his gang. This strange black car causes everyone in the gang to feel as if they need to race it. Yet what no one knows is that the new strange car is out to destroy Packard's gang. And there is something else. The Wraith. A mysterious spirit that is somehow connected to the new car. Packard soon realizes that there is something strange going on, something that is perhaps connected to him..to something that he and his gang did..perhaps even connected to that new guy in town, Jake.I think The Wraith is a fantastic movie,although in my opinion, the film could have been more creative with the car racing sequences and maybe could have explained a bit more about Jake and his past, but otherwise I have no other criticisms. The gang of bad guys was mean but at the same time they offered comedic relief and fun. Characters such as Skank (played by David Sherrill)will always be memorable whenever I watch this film.

74,Ma_Herbo,Fun movie,7,27 November 2017,"I'm a child of the 80's, I like cars and heavy metal, yet I never heard of this movie before. I don't know why, because it is a fun movie.I've been watching a lot of low-budget B-movies lately (with the quality that goes with it), and this one was a breath a fresh air. Yes, the story is not that well developed, there are no suspense or surprises in the plot. Apart from NICK CASSAVETES as a psychopath, the acting is often very cold and mechanical. But there is a cartoonish side on the movie that kind of excuses all of that.By reading the comments on IMDb, I was expecting some cheesy car chases with bad editing and bad special effects. Not at all. Very well done, especially knowing it has a limited budget. For the car racing atmosphere, I prefer watching this movie instead of the FAST & FURIOUS series (even the first ones). Yes, there are a lot of unbelievable explosions but, because of the supernatural nature of the movie, everything is possible, right?On the music side, I was turned off at first when the movie began with some cheesy synthesizer music, typical of low-budget 80's movies. Fortunately, this music was just there to announce the supernatural scenes of the movie and soon we are fed with more fun music from Motlëy Crüe, Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol or Robert Palmer.SHERILYN FENN is astonishingly beautiful in this movie. The young CHARLIE SEEN is good on the eyes for the ladies as well, even though his role is surprisingly thin despite being the hero in the story.Although the main story seems to be about revenge, I like the sub- plots about a guy being jealous of the girl he can never have (completely going wacko which, sadly, happens too often in real life) and about how the hero suggests that you have to stand up to your bully, which do happens later in the movie (the parking lot fight scene and Keri telling off Packard when in the car, going to California).All in all, for me, this movie should be up there with THE TERMINATOR or TOP GUN as a good action movie of the 80's, especially when comparing the budgets of those movies.",The Wraith

Cassavetes broods constantly, and doesn't do much else. The soundtrack is AWFUL. Some eighties music could be cool, if culled from indie or alternative genres. Spandex-clad hair bands died out as quickly as disco did in the seventies, both for an excellent reason. Their music stinks.

82,unforgivenmaster737,A fantastically dumb wonderful awesome movie hybrid,10,9 July 2005,"Wow. I discovered this little gem of a movie when my dad bought a crap load of DVD's from one of his friends.Before I begin with this review, I have to say that the soundtrack of this movie is really unbelievably great. If you want it, you might have to spend upwards of 80 dollars for it... it's been out of production for quite awhile now. In fact, I downloaded the two best tracks from it: ""Where's the Fire?"" by Tim Feehan, and ""Hearts vs. Heads"" by Stan Bush. You have to download them right now.Anyways, on to the review.The movie is about a weird guy in a funny looking suit who comes to town in a very snazzy futuristic car. His mission is to get revenge, and the person is seeking is a guy named Packard (Nick Cassavetes), a person so unflinchingly bad, he stretches the known laws of space. The opening is of him and his stupid idiot henchman taking a car from a couple by cheating in a race.Just to get it out of the way right now, Packard is a sadistic son of a whore. You'll get a clear picture of just how ridiculously mean he is later on, but for now, let's continue with the story.Anyways, around the same time this ""wraith"" comes to town (ahhhh, sheer brilliance, i must say), a young man named Jake (Charlie Sheen) comes to town on a weird sounding dirt bike. He tries to pick up a girl named Keri (Sherilynn Fenn), but Packard won't have it. See, through flashbacks of a certain night a long, long time ago, we see a guy who kinda looks like Jake having sex with Keri. The flashbacks become more and more clearer as the movie goes on, and from there we see that Packard killed the young man to get Keri all his own.What a guy, I tell you.Anyways, if you haven't already figured it out, Jake is the young man re-incarnated, and he's also the stranger with the car. He's here for one thing, and that's killing everyone who was involved with his death. How does he do this? Well, Packard's gang is very keen on racing people for their cars, so he does this to everyone is Packard's gang, and at the end of each race, he sits there and has their car run into his and explode.Right...So, this is all looking very weird, and the local sheriff, Loomis (Randy Quaid)is not really concerned, since it seems that it's only Packard's gang this killer is hitting. So that's his role: to talk to Packard, and go on vein attempts at nabbing the killer.Wahoo.So, while that is going on, Jake gets with Keri, meets his brother, Billy (Matthew Barry), etc.The ending is probably what you expected: Jake and Packard duke it out with their cars, with Jake ultimately prevailing. It's at that time his identity is finally revealed, and he leaves his car to his brother and rides with Keri into the sunset.Wahoo. But seriously speaking, I really, really enjoyed this movie. There are some decent performances, especially from Cassavetes, who apparently likes playing a prick. Charlie Sheen does what he can with what he's got, and he pulls it off well. Sherilynn Fenn does what she does best: shows her breasts (well, one of them anyway), and finally there's Clint Howard! Basically, it's dumb fun at it's finest, and I'm glad I have it in my collection. It shouldn't be too much money, so I suggest you buy it.",The Wraith
83,bacardicazz,Entertaining & Laughable Fodder,5,9 February 2016,"This is not a great movie. Nor is it a good one. But for those looking for nothing more than entertainment, this will do. Charlie Sheen stars as Jake, the reincarnation of some guy named Jamie, who rises from the dead and travels through space in a customized Turbo in order to avenge his death. Packard, the antagonist, along with his gang of stupendous engineers are eliminated one by one, and with great ease. The story will surprise no one at any point. Things happen exactly as you'd expect, if you'd turn off your imagination. Photography is contrastingly well done, but gets stunned by poor editing. Just analyze the scene where Sheen and Fenn are peddling through the water: as soon as they have had their 'moment', Sheen turns and they both peddle away. The scene lasts too long and feels like amateur hour. Story wise, nothing makes sense. It is exactly what you'd expect from an 80s B-movie starring Charlie Sheen. Packard kills any guy who so much as looks at his girl, and the whole town knows. Do the police even care? Nope. Too busy throwing around catchphrases like ""I don't need a warrant when I have this badge"". Charlie Sheen gives such tranquilized performance that it makes me wonder what kind of synthetic drugs were in his system. Man, that speech about bullies and fear... not a single emotion detected! Sherilynn Fenn had trouble retorting after such a dull performance... Luckily, she steals every scene she's in just by being there. In Twin Peaks she was beautiful, here the universe's brightest stars have taken residence in her eyes. Unparallelled hotness! Nick Cassavetes (director of The Notebook!) stars as Packard, a downright evil sociopath. He has evil authority to him, to the point where watching recent interviews with him have a startling effect. And Randy Quaid is Randy Quaid. Always loony, always fun to watch. The inexplicable choice of trying to be taken serious at times whilst being a B-movie, takes the pace out of some scenes. But Randy, when given this dialogue, applies some much needed redneck enthusiasm, making the lines snappy and more digestible. I had fun watching this, but I'm not giving the movie a pass - it being a B-movie in almost every way.",The Wraith
84,sa420,This IS a classic 80's b-movie!,9,12 March 2005,"It makes me laugh when I read bad reviews of this movie. No one claimed it was a classic, no claimed it would win awards or prizes for depth of storyline etc.What it does have is earnest performances, fantastic fx, amazing score and very pretty photography.Yes, laugh at the shadow of the camera (in the days before monitors) during the race scenes, at least they bothered to use real cars on real roads at high speed, unlike pathetic cgi cars (fast & the furious, 2 fast 2 furious, gone in 60 seconds) with crap physics.This movie is totally innovative, nothing like it before or since and there are a lot of techniques used in this movie that I haven't seen bettered since. The bit where Jake's scrambler breaks into 4 meteorites still looks great, the tasteful re-animation of the Wraith mobile after crashes (nowadays that would probably be done using reverse photography).The action scenes in Mad Max & Mad Max 2 are sped up and look ridiculous. (Watch the bit in Mad Max 2 just before he crashes his Interceptor...you'll see.)The acting is pantomimish (baddies=very bad, goodies=very good) but that is the style of this movie. We know that these actors are capable of more in-depth characterisations, but this is a shallow b-movie. That's all it's supposed to be. Anyone who watches this movie and expects anything other than popcorn fodder is an absolute idiot. Moaning about technical problems and poor acting only makes you look like an idiot. And let's face it, even today's biggest blockbusters are chock full of mistakes and glitches.You don't watch a Carry On movie and then say ""Oh, that was quite unrealistic, and the acting is bad."" That's the point. It's silly farce. You're not supposed to take it seriously!I'm also aware that Charlie Sheen hates this movie and he must have good reason.Strangely enough, I'm surprised that this movie was not seized upon by the pompous comic book brigade! I guess, if it was a little more Gothic and The Wraith was brooding and had a troubled back story it would have been more accepted. I'm glad it didn't and wasn't.If it was made now, it would have stinking CGI fx and too much back story.It's a bubblegum movie. You don't like it, don't watch it. As a b-movie for it's time, it is a technically superior easy watch which still towers over many newer movies of the same genre. The Crow? Pompous nonsense!Hellboy? Crap!The Wraith? Know's it's place and doesn't try to overstep it's mark!And for people moaning about rubbish acting, check out Matthew Barry's performance when Billy Hankins realises Jake is his brother.

Only problem is. Jake is killed by Packard and his gang of misfits. (always wanted to say that) Thats when he comes back as The Wraith.

But, its still just as fun to watch as it was when i was younger and watched it. Of course this isn't the best sci fi movie made. and it is by far the worst. its just a fun movie to watch with the actors in it that have made more of a name for themselves now than they did then.! of course, just like the other movies i review. grab a 6 pack on a rainy day, and you'll LOVE this movie for sure.!",The Wraith

The characters are very good; although, I felt that Charlie Sheen was a bit wasted as the title role of the movie.  I wish that we got to see a little more of that shotgun he uses.  Nick Cassavetes is great as the villain - in fact, he's so evil that I named a character in one of my stories after his character of Packard Walsh just as a reference to show how evil my character is.  The action is good.  And the script is well-written with a lot of good and bizarre twists.  But what I liked most about this film was the soundtrack.  I wish I can find at a used record store or something.  I love the song ""Hold on Blue Eyes"" by LaMarca which plays in the scene where Charlie Sheen and Sherilyn Fenn are making love in the pond. In fact because of that song (and other reasons), I thought that was the best scene in the movie.  The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was Sherilyn Fenn's annoying performance.  If I was Charlie, I'm not sure if I'd really want to return from the dead for her.",The Wraith
87,docdcs50,"""Tried to cut it some slack""",2,8 June 2020,"I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this. Quite a few reviews said the only thing worthwhile about this movie was the 80' music and the car races. Soundtrack was pretty good but the racing, tame, even boring. The really painful part of this movie is the painful, cartoonish, portrayal of the ""thugs"". Stupid names, wierd twitches, snorting WD-40, not one of them was SLIGHTLY intimindating . I was embrassed to have to watch these guys trying to be ""tough""",The Wraith
88,cyberia23,This didn't age well,5,19 September 2005,"I loved this movie when I was growing up in the '80s. I had Knight Rider - Road Warrior - and Transformers on the brain back then, so of course a movie about a ""ghostly magical car and it's mysterious driver that kills people"" was too cool for me to ignore. I think I payed more attention to all the cool car action than the story line when I watched it. I thought this movie was the coolest ever.Now, 20 years later, I can say this movie didn't ""age"" very well and I can't believe how stupid it really is, especially the cheesy dialog of Sheriff Loomis (a.k.a Randy Quaid) and bad acting and directing of the rest of it. The only two characters I think are entertaining to watch were Skank and Gutterboy. I laugh aloud whenever I see the wraith costume, which looks like a paint-ball suit with elbow pads and a motorcycle helmet. Not much thought went into that design. I will admit that the special effects used in the movie looked ahead of their time, for a mid-80's movie, and still look pretty cool today - especially when the wraith car repairs itself after a crash.Anyway, I gave this movie a moderate 5 out of 10 for nostalgia reasons. I did love it as a kid and I know if you asked me in 1986 I would have given it ""20 out of 10"" if it were possible. Today I see a low-budget sci-fi movie mixed with a 2 hour of ""product placement"" for Chrysler.",The Wraith
89,markbob-917,Of it's time,5,18 April 2020,"Ok so I can understand why a lot of people are big fans of this film, and I think if I saw it back when I was a teen I think I'd have loved it to however seeing it for the first time now it's not such an easy watch. There are huge jumps - first scene where Keri is approached by Jake on his bike and she's more than ready to jump on the back of his bike after literally asking him if he's new in town - I get that looking at this in our eyes today that's a huge no no but even back in the 80's? Other than things like that there were parts that were enjoyable and it's definitely worth a watch but not sure if it's worth repeat viewings",The Wraith

92,feXis,B+ B movie,7,21 February 2003,"As far as B movies go, this one's up there. The acting isn't great, the plot's a little cheesy... but the movie still has very redeeming qualities:  First off, the Dodge Turbo Interceptor is a bad-A car.  Also, the movie never really drags on, which is a hard thing to say for most B movies.  Lastly, even though their acting may not be real hot, Gutterboy and Skank are fairly believable (and hilarious) characters. If you like Charlie Sheen and want a glimpe into his humble beginnings, check this one out!",The Wraith

95,kevlar991,I still enjoy this movie....,6,2 February 2004,"I remember watching this movie back when I was in like grade 7 or 8, A friend of mine had even seen it in the theater, call me crazy but this was one of my favorite movies back then when there was no dvd, I just recently bought the dvd cause my vhs original was wearing out, Anyways its one of the few cool car movies from back then, I think charlie sheen was like 20 when he made it, The movie has a good soundtrack, I seen the cd sell for 500 bucks on ebay like 5 years ago, I think its one of the better revenge type movies, I wish there was more to the story on how jamie got the car, or maybe a prequal could have been made with the car being used by a different person, Look up that car called the ppg interceptor made by dodge, I think it had cost like 1.2 million to build it was a pace car also, rent this movie if you can find it...",The Wraith
96,whitesnake1985,Best movie about a ghost from outter space who drives a race car and takes on a gang of motor thugs in Arizona.,10,22 January 2004,"This is one of my personal favorites not just because it has a truly awesome car,The Tubo Interseptor,but it also has a cool almost Western like plot.The story starts with a bizarre spirit forming in the middle of a vacant Arizona road,he apparantly comes from outter space,along with his super-flashy car.This spirit or Wraith as he is referred to in the title is actually the avenging spirit of a murdered local kid back to take on the gang who killed him and that has been terrorizing the roads of Arizona.Charlie Sheen plays the Wraith and Sheryle Fenn plays his girl-friend who is being practically held captive by the leader of the same motor gang that killed Sheen's characterfrom the beginning.Naturally,The Wraith,or Jake as he is called when in human form,takes on these motor thugs one-on-one in some very cool and dizzying death races.In my humble opinion,the best part of this film is the soundtrack.With awesome hard rock from Ozzy,Billy Idol,Robert Palmer,Lion,Honey-moon suite and my personal fav Motley Crue. This film is really like High Planes Drifter meets The Road Warrior,being it combines classic revenge western with action road rage films.My only complaint is that the dialouge could have been much deeper and more serious but then again,this was never meant to be Shakespeare.Randy Quaide needed more screen time as well.All in all ,however,this one is 100 times better than any of those bloated,computer created dumb kiddy rides like Fast and The Furious or Tourque.This is a real road rage film. 4 out of 5 stars.",The Wraith
97,Cine-Maniacal,Nothing Not to Like,8,4 March 2012,"Is there anything about this movie that sets it above any other 80s flick, or racing movie, or revenge thriller? No. Not a thing. It has all the expected features for any 80s movie ever made, from the cast to the soundtrack. But it is no worse (nor better) than any of the others from that era. There is a lot to like here, but for those with limited tolerance for cheese or goofy plot lines, there will be plenty to hate. Be prepared to suspend your disbelief and open your might to the 80s nostalgia and movie conventions. Most of all, sit back, shut-up, and enjoy.Note: This is my standard disclaimer when offering reviews for movies of this sort (cult classics, 80s & 90s standards, etc.): Plenty of others have already recounted the plot, cast, effects, and so forth ... so I don't waste your time or mine rehashing all of that. I prefer to offer a brief, succinct opinion comparing films to others in their genre or class.",The Wraith
98,cari0021,Sheen's Post-Impressionist Masterpiece,9,14 July 2005,"Very few films past or present stray from the predictable form of a fluid linear narrative. Exposition, conflict, resolution, and possibly an occasional flashback or revisiting of an earlier moment---these are all staples of visual story telling. Charlie Sheen's late 80's action masterpiece THE WRAITH, however, successfully ventures down a road much less traveled by filmmakers, a road which guides viewers through an assemblage of scenes which seem somehow related, but give no indication of how or why.Ingeniuosly, the many questions of THE WRAITH, much like the guiding directions in other impressionist images, provide a grander picture of a straight forward story of love, loss, and revenge. Who is the angelic avenger that, one by one, picks off the gang of road-rash-ruffians in a futuristic car? Who, inexplicably halfway through the picture, receives his untimely demise from the ruffians in the trunk of car? Can it be the same character so craftily played by Sheen, a charming young man who both befriends the young short-order chef and knocks boots with the buxomly Sherilyn Flynn? Thankfully the audience is given a clue to THE WRAITH's avante-garde modus in the air brushed leather jacket of Nick Cassavettes: the skull-among-flames symbolizes many things, maybe most important of which is the picture's dramatic refutation of sensible organization. The line between the beautiful, bone-white skull and the jacket's hot, licking flames, is blurred in the same fashion as the line of narrative arch which threads through THE WRAITH.80's Action connoisseurs will appreciate the steely-eyed performance Sheen gives, as well as the supplemental contributions of Chuck Howard and Randy ""Uncle Eddy"" Quaid. From the first moment Flynn appears on the screen, there can be no doubt that Sheen will take her to the mat---or in this case, an Arizona hot spring---and there can be no doubt that Cassevettes and co. will receive their devilish comeuppance. During the course of such a spectacle, the audience must then ultimately ask itself, will we be able to handle the power contained in rest of this film? And if so, more importantly, will we be able to ever again stomach the banality of traditional film?",The Wraith
99,Reddragon_Rdclan,The wrath,1,17 December 2005,"Well , i watched the film a while back , and what can i say... the acting was abysmal, the cast was in my opinion poor, and the film in general was not creative in the slightest. With names like ""Skank"" and ""Rughead"" you can surely see where I'm coming from. There was a part in the film ( don't want to spoil it for you , but I'm sure that you're never want to watch it ) where they went to a beach. Well this beach was basically just a river ( Yes really , its this bad). Now you're most likely wondering , why i haven't yet reviewed the awesome car chase's the Wraith holds, well if you call a few dodgy race's , and a guy at the end in a black car , witch may i add looks incredibly poor car chase's, well yeah OK the Wraith has a few of them.

100,DILLIGAF-2,Certified Classic for the 80's,10,30 September 1999,"I MUST HAVE THIS SOUND TRACK!!! No longer in production, as you watch this movie and how the sound track rolls with it you'll see why both the movie and sound track are classic collector material. Some of the the dialogue was odd (like the plot), but what in the 80's wasn't?  Not be goofy with any ""message"", but I like the love conquers theme and always good vs. bad.  The special shots of the races, close to the road were nifty, it gave it a somewhat other-worldly feel and oh that car!!! Dodge really ought to go back to the production line and sell some to Joe Public.  Granted not many of the stars may be thrilled with such early work and wish to be thought of as more serious, mature actors, but we all have come a long way, considering it was later that Charles Sheen was in Platoon. He's come a long way, but even in The Wraith, his star was shining, much like Mr. Quaid and Ms. Fenn....& As always, Mr. Howard provides an excellent supporting role.

Since I had viewed it so much as a kid, it was like going back and watching a movie you almost know by heart but at the same time weren't really sure what was going to happen next.The soundtrack was great, with the likes of Ozzy, Billy Idol, Robert Palmer and others. Looking at all that 80's ""fashion"" was fun too. The DVD box didn't say the year but I had determined it to be about '86 or '87.I couldn't help but draw a comparison to this storyline and that of ""The Crow"". ""The Crow"" is definitely a darker piece of fun but the same ""guy done wrong takes revenge and finds his girl"" wasn't hard to miss.All in all, if you're looking for something fun, with a great soundtrack, cool cars and fast car races, check it out!",The Wraith

The script is hokey, yet there are some really tender moments, like when Billy Hankins realizes who the Wraith really is. The acting is OK but this isn't Shakespeare. This movie is a great escape. Plus the revenge angle is definitely cool. The ending is actually a little reminiscent of ""High Plains Drifter"", where there is that one unspoken moment where fantasy and reality blur. This is actually one of my favorite films of the 80's. Sure it is massively dated, but, interesting none the less.

Unless of course it is a salute to the dreadful 'B' movies of the late 50's, early '60's. Even then it missed by a mile. The film does not know if it is a revenge, sci-fi or scary movie. Sheen and Fenn must be thanking their lucky stars that they didn't sink from trace as this movie should have done. Max Max had been made 7 years prior to this stinker and despite being filmed on string outshines this film by a mile. I can only think that all the actors, film crew and extras had a spare afternoon together with a couple of cameras and loads of free film. No wonder the director has 3 other names. I'd have tried to hide too.",The Wraith

Yes, other reviews will tell you all about the 'holes in the plot' or pick apart the making, but for sheer nostalgic value, this is a hit. Admittedly, a lot of my enthusiasm for this movie has to do with the fact that I was thirteen years old in 1986. I have had several talks with friends about the 'cool' movies we remembered growing up, and ""The Wraith"" always surfaces. Movies like this one are fun to sit back and grin a little bit at how serious they really were when making it, and poke some fun at a young Charlie Sheen and Randy Quaid. It may be slightly on the guy side of the chart, but for anyone that likes a little cheese now and then (especially if you were a young teen in the 80's), check this one out.",The Wraith
