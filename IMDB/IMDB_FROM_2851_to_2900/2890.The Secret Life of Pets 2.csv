0,SnoopyStyle,slightly better,6,15 September 2019,Max doesn't see the appeal of human babies until his owner Katie has a baby of her own. He finds himself falling for the kid to the point of being neurotically fearful for him. The family goes to the country where the dogs are mentored by the confident sheep dog Rooster. Max leaves his favorite toy Busy Bee in the care of Gidget who promptly loses it to the old lady's numerous cats. Snowball sees himself as a superhero ready to help the helpless. Daisy comes in looking for help with a tiger imprisoned in a circus.The first one is fine for little kids. It's loud and it's brightly colored. The story gets too big and too outlandish. This one is a little better. I don't find myself getting quite as bored with the story. The scale of the story is pulled back to a more reasonable level. The circus is probably as outrageous as it can get without going over. The plot does split up into three stories which is a major drawback. This franchise succeeds more when the characters join up and gain more chemistry. The gang needs to stay together. This one takes a step up from competent entertainment for little kids to acceptable time for a family to spend together.,The Secret Life of Pets 2
1,nogodnomasters,Are you sure that's my tiger?,6,18 June 2019,"The freshness of apply anthropomorphic qualities to animals has worn off. For some reason, the tiger and wolves don't talk. The film has several things going on at one time. The new baby issue didn't amount to anything. Max visits a farm. And a group saves a tiger. It has fun moments for the kids, but it lacked adult appeal.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
2,kosmasp,"More ""secrets"", more life",7,19 August 2020,"Obviously you have to have a heart for animals and pets to even begin to love or like this. Anything less than that, will not work for you or the movie watching experience you're about to engage. Having said that, that is just the lowest common denominator one has to have with those liking this movie (and it's predecessor).The other thing is, that the movie has to be good. And while I would argue it isn't fantastic or amazing, it is more than decent, if you let it. Yes some characters can be annoying to say the least ... but that seems to be their jobs, right? So if you don't mind this having cliches, being ""simple"" and other things like that, you will have fun. Especially if you watch with a kid.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
3,paul_haakonsen,Almost as good as the first movie...,6,2 March 2020,"This 2019 ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" is a good animated movie, although not quite as marvelous as the 2016 prequel movie.""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" is a fast-paced and fun movie for the entire family. There is virtually something for everyone in the audience here, so you can sit down and be entertained, that is for sure.The CGI and drawing style is quite good and continues with the quality from the first movie, which is quite nice.They have a rather good voice cast for the various roles. Which is quite good, especially for an animated movie, where having a proper cast to do the voices is alpha and omega.If you enjoyed the 2016 ""The Secret Life of Pets"" animated movie, then you will definitely also like this sequel. There is a good amount of fun and laughter to be had throughout the course of this animated movie, that is guaranteed.I am rating ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" a well-deserved six out of ten stars.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
4,view_and_review,Overcoming Fears,7,12 June 2019,"Part two of The Secret Life of Pets tracks three separate stories that are loosely tied together. There's Max (Patton Oswalt) who needs to overcome his irrational fear of everything. There's Snowball (Kevin Hart) who fancies himself a superhero of sorts and goes on a mission. And there's Gidget (Jenny Slate) who has to infiltrate a hoard of cats to retrieve a toy.The three separate story lines offered variety for the otherwise weary viewer. I thought the movie was adequate, nothing special. All of the main characters are comedians and I think they gave the script as much of a humorous vibe as they could. There were precious few laughs, even from my nine-year-old. Still, we left the theater satisfied.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
5,mm-39,Better than the Original!,9,26 June 2019,"Better than the prequel. The Secret Life of Pets 2 has three stories melded into continuity and humor. Pets and children was the theme with Max. Max the dog which over worries is with the farm dog Rooster (Harrison Ford's voice), who go on an adventure. Snowball is on an adventure to save a tiger, and Gidget must get Max's ball back, which are humorous adventures. The cat laser light scene is hilarious. Not much of Sweet Pea, the Budgie, regrettably, but Sweet Pea is cute as ever. Funny how the budgie looks over serious like budgies do. Not the usual over heavy social messages and formulated animal goes away from home and gets lost story. The animation was not the usual run of mill C G I style super hero movie. Worth watching. I was pleasantly surprised when I view a sequel which is better the prequel. Worth watching. 9 stars. Not one kid was bored during the whole film and audience was completely captivated.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
6,deloudelouvain,Better than the first one.,7,23 October 2019,"I might not have the right age anymore for those kind of movies but to be honest I did enjoy it. I watched the first movie and liked it, but to me the second one is slightly better. The humor is the best thing about this movie. It doesn't matter what age you are, humor is humor, if somethings makes you laugh enjoy it, and that's why I watched this movie. The voice-overs were better than in the first movie and the animation is just top notch.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
7,Mr-Fusion,A winning improvement!,7,10 June 2019,"This is a sequel that seemed to really pay off on the concept more effectively than the first movie. As funny as the exploits of a domesticated cat are (and Chloe continues to be my favorite character), the movie doesn't suffer when the pets leave their apartments and go on an adventure. Even the addition of Harrison Ford, playing to his curmudgeonly strengths, fits right in.Where I was lukewarm on the original, this is much more charming, and I can see this becoming another Despicable Me-esque franchise. I'm ready for more.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
8,cherold,As hilarious and likable as the original,8,25 August 2019,"This movie is essentially three separate plot threads - (in order of fancifulness:) dogs visit a farm, a different dog rescues a chew toy from a den of cats, a rabbit attempts to rescue a tiger - and then brings them together into a big finale.As with the first film, a lot of what makes this movie great is those simple observations of how animals behave - a cat trying to wake it's owner is hilarious because it's so on point - but it manages to blend this with totally absurd sequences like a bunny battling wolves.I don't understand why these two movies both have a relatively low rating of 6.5 on IMDB; me and my girlfriend love them both.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
9,FeastMode,not nearly as good as the first but still entertaining,6,18 October 2019,I enjoyed this movie. it was all amusing and a few parts made me crack up. but it wasn't as consistently funny as the first. and the story was all over the place. but i still had a good time with it (1 viewing 10/17/19),The Secret Life of Pets 2
10,Robert_duder,Cute but falls short of the original,7,10 June 2019,"I'm not sure what made the original so watchable, the cast is very good and the story was fun and how lifelike they make the pets seem. This all translates to the sequel very well. The cast is still great (Louis CK being replaced by Patton Oswalt is hardly noticeable) and Eric Stonestreet is not used enough in the sequel in my opinion so Duke fans might feel a little left out. Basically you get 2.5 stories all rolled into one movie and honestly any of those stories could have been fleshed out to make an entire movie and I think that's where SLOP2 falls short. It doesn't have one really good story and the characters don't get together enough until the very end and you have this trip to the farm which had potential for so many new characters (Rooster was a great addition and Harrison Ford did a terrific job!) Then you have the sub-story about Captain Snowball and the evil circus owner which easily could have been it's own movie. Then you have the sub-sub story of Gidget trying to retrieve Max's favorite toy from the cat-lady's house. All the stories eventually intertwine and each have their own ups and downs but you never feel really invested in any one of the storylines. Still the film is insatiably cute and the pets feel as real as they ever did. Chloe teaching Gidget how to be a cat was amazing. Other scenes felt a little forced to try to fit more of the original cast into it. Kevin Hart is terrific as Snowball and he really could have done his own movie I think. All in all kids will love it but I can see why it's not making the same splash as the original did. 7/10",The Secret Life of Pets 2
11,Edvis-1997,7,7,11 April 2021,"Well, first part had more whole family friendly episodes and this one is more childish and created for kids.

12,westsideschl,Voicing & Animation Quality,8,15 September 2019,"What makes a good animation besides the obvious storyline, & dialogue is animation quality & voice choices. Secret 2 did well on all. Storyline had humor & purposeful ethos for all ages. Dialogue intelligent (for animated animals) for the most part.
Animation quality was good (not the best, but better than most; e.g. had some static backgrounds, and some lack of individualized fine detail). Voicing was good w/the exception being name actors which usually don't add the idiosyncratic nuances that professional voice actors can give.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
13,briancham1994,Better than the original,6,31 May 2020,"I think I'm the only person who thinks this is better than the original. It is more streamlined and has less corny jokes.

14,cruise01,A forgettable sequel but still enjoyable.,6,31 August 2019,"The Secret Life of Pets 2 (3 out of 5 stars).The Secret Life of Pets 2 is a decent family animated comedy film that kids will love more than the adults. The story continues with the characters from the first film. The film follows Max when his owner falls in love with a guy. And they begin their lives together and have a child. Which he was afraid at first. Until, Max falls in love with the kid and tries to be a babysitter for the kid. Meanwhile, Snowball the bunny and another dog rescue a tiger from a circus. Which they try to sneak into their apartment complex.The plot is thin and decent with this sequel. Which makes you wonder what the whole story of this movie. The theme of bravery comes into play when Max runs into Rooster which is a farm dog. That tries to make him brave.The film does have some fun humor that kids will love. The animation is colorful and fun to look at. The voice talent is decent.Overall, The Secret Life of Pets 2 is a fair film. Kids will love the movie more. Adults may get a little bored with the movie since the humor is aiming for the younger audiences. The story is thin and the movie is a bit boring with this sequel.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
15,filipemanuelneto,"A sequel that honors the original, but fails to match it.",9,10 May 2020,"From the same creators of ""Despicable Me"", this film is the first sequel to be made by Illumination Studios outside of that same franchise. And in fact, it was predictable that it would appear as the first ""Pets"" was a notable success.The film takes up the characters we already know: this time, Max and Duke have to adapt to their owner's little son. Max took a long time to do it but ends up so fond of the child that he becomes overprotective and always afraid for him. When the family is going to a season in the countryside, he has the opportunity to face his newly acquired fears. Meanwhile, Snowball's life as a pet is perfect, with the white rabbit creating superhero illusions thanks to the plays with his child owner. The illusion, however, give him the chance to rescue a young white tiger who suffered abuse at the hands of a circus. Therefore, as you can see, the film has several plots that run in parallel, with a predominance of the plot of Snowball and the tiger, Hu. I believe that this was the biggest problem of the film, in that it relegates two central characters of the previous film (Max and Duke) to a highly secondary plan, besides making the film more complicated to understand for the younger ones.Moreover, the film brings little major news. One thing that was corrected was the number of characters having an active part in the plot. The previous film had a multitude of characters acting in a group. Here, Mel disappears and Pops, Sweet Pea and Buddy appear only in cameo. Cloe, Reginald and Gidget remain present, but only as a ""support team"" for the other characters. It is clear that Gidget's romantic daydreams about Max never developed also. The tiger, Hu, was very well designed and looks more like a very big cat, for being so docile. The most drastic change is Snowball, who became a heroic figure when he was the great villain of the previous film, where he even had a certain psychopathic personality. The transformation, however, was easy to predict for those who saw the end of the first film. Back in excellent shape are also the voice actors from the first film, with the exception of Louis C.K., who stepped down after a sex scandal and was replaced by Patton Oswalt. The film also has the additions of Tiffany Haddish and Harrison Ford, in his first voice work. Again, dialogues and jokes are still well thought out, but making you smile rather than laugh.Technically, it is a film where it was difficult to demand better. The CGI and the quality of the animations are impeccable, with the animals drawn in their details, magnificent colors and light, movement and action at the right times and guaranteed doses of cuteness. The pace is good, and I never felt it dragged. The soundtrack is still signed by Alexandre Desplat, but it was not as close to my ear as the one in the first film, being too similar to many others that circulated there.Although not as good or as well done as the first, this film is an honorable sequel that knows how to live up to the existing material and the expectations of the public.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
16,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,5,12 September 2019,"This movie was good enough but not as good as the first movie. There were some cliches here and the overall feeling of the movie was flat, as it followed too many pets around, but the finale was just perfect and funny.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
17,leonblackwood,Worth a One-Watch! 6/10,6,8 January 2020,"Review:
Although the animation is half-decent, and Snowball is hilarious, I still found this movie to be quite average. The various characters made the film watchable, and some of the jokes are funny, but it seemed pretty basic compared to other films in this genre. Personally, I would have preferred the movie to be based on Snowball (Kevin Hart) and Daisy (Tiffany Haddish), except for Max (Patton Oswalt), who was very much like Woody in the Toy Story movies. Rooster, voiced by Harrison Ford, was also a great addition to the cast, and the short but hilarious ""Panda"" song, made me rewind it loads of times, but it still seemed like there was something missing. There is enough material to keep adults, and the little ones, interested throughout, but once you know the outcome, I cant see many people going back for a second watch. Anyway, the movie is set sometime after the events of the first film, was Max & Duke's owner, Katie, get's married to a man named Chuck. After a while, they get married and have a son called Liam, whom Max disapproves of at first due to his rough play, but eventually softens up to him. Later, Max's overprotective feelings for Liam develop into an itch which prompts Katie to get him a dog cone from the veterinarian, in an effort to lower his symptoms. Max's luck changes when Duke reveals that the family is going on a road trip outside the city. When Max and Duke's family reaches a farm owned by Chuck's uncle, Max grows unaccustomed to the farm's ways, including local sheepdog Rooster. After an incident, they soon become friends, and on his departure, Rooster gives Max one of his handkerchiefs as a souvenir. Before Max left, he had entrusted his favourite toy, Busy Bee, to Gidget. Unfortunately, Gidget loses Busy Bee in a cat-infested apartment owned by a cat lady. She receives cat lessons from Chloe, Mel, Buddy and Sweet Pea in order to sneak in the apartment easier. With the help of Norman, she successfully retrieves Busy Bee and unintentionally gets hailed as the ""Queen Of Cats"". Meanwhile, Chloe and Snowball meet Daisy, who explains that she needs Snowball, to assist her rescuing a White Tiger cub named Hu, who Is being held captive by an abusive circus owner named Sergei. Daisy and Snowball sneak in and find the circus Hu is in. With much difficulty from Sergei's black wolves, they free Hu from the circus. However, in the heat of the escape, Daisy accidentally drops her flower clip, which the wolves use to track her down. She and Snowball take him to Pops apartment first. Pops reluctantly lets Hu live there at first, but due to the destruction of the apartment, Hu is kicked out and relocated in Max and Duke's apartment. Around the same time, the family returns from the trip. Sergei and his wolves track Daisy down and capture both Hu and Daisy. Sergei escapes in a train moving for the circus in which Snowball, Max and Norman pursue, whilst contacting Gidget. The cats take their owner off to pursuit the train. Will they save the day... You have to watch it to see what happens if you haven't already. There are a lot of similarities to Toy Story 4, in terms of how much the toy/animal meant to a child, but I personally think that Toy Story 4 was written much better. With that aside, it's still a watchable movie, especially when Snowball is in Kung Fu mode, but the 3 parallel storylines, do become a mess after a while. If they do decide to release a 3rd movie, they really need to concentrate on Snowball, or even give him his own franchise because, without him, this film would have got the thumbs down from me. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Chris Renaud, who also brought you, No Time For Nuts, Despicable Me, The Lorax, Despicable Me 2 and The Secret Life of Pets. This movie obviously didn't go down to well with film-goers because it just about made half the amount thaN the original, even though it had a decent cast. It's still fun for the whole family, but it lacked originality.Budget: $80million

18,southdavid,Tiger Uppercut,5,3 June 2019,"Bland but inoffensive sequel to Illumination pictures other successful series.
Max (now voiced by Patton Oswald after the unpleasantness) is struck with anxiety following the arrival of a toddler in his life. Meanwhile, under his superhero alter ego, Snowball (Kevin Hart) is charged with rescuing a Tiger from his cruel Circus master.
Technically, ""Secret Life Of Pets 2"" is very strong. It looks great, the characters are very stylised but memorable. The movement and action bits are good and there's one scene of traditional animation that stands out. Vocal performances are pretty good too, whether it's consistent artists like Nick Kroll or Jenny Slate, or a laconic effort from Harrison Ford.
Where the film is less successful is with its script and story. The three strands of the plot are largely unconnected until they are crowbarred together at the finale. Also, whilst it's reasonably amusing, it should be said there isn't much for the grownups to enjoy and any of the moments that were have featured in the various trailers that have been pre-empting the release for what feels like years.
It's a decent effort with some likeable elements, but to describe it as great, or even good feels like a stretch.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

Back in NYC and Snowball(Kevin Hart) wants to be a superhero and teams up with Daisy(Tiffany Hadish) who wants his help to save a circus tiger.Overall this was a great movie.

20,subxerogravity,That was really good!,7,13 June 2019,"I came in not expecting much and it starts slow but picks up to a pace that is filled with fun and laughter.
You don't have to watch the first movie to get into the characters from the original. Kevin Hart is funny as snowball the rabbit weather you seen the original or not.
Plus some new characters like Harrison Ford as Rooster where just perfectly done.

21,jamesrupert2014,Fun for the kids and companion-animal companions,7,23 August 2021,"The various pets from the original film team up in three essentially separate adventures (dog-life on a farm, rescuing a dog-toy from an army of cats, and freeing a captive tiger cub). Full of fun and frenetic action, the film will appeal to kids and there's enough 'wit' to keep adults amused (especially pet-owners) who will also likely approve of the earnest but simple messaging (friendship, being true to yourself, finding strength in the face of adversity, helping the less fortunate, etc.).

He even has a few stories that will be infinitly quotable.Otherwise you have the laser gag and that's really it as far as laughs.The animation is smooth and has a nice sort of Gershwin feel to it, but otherwise the Pets 2 is nothing to write home about. It doesn't really win with the comedy vibe or the adventure vibe, it all feels rehashed, like we've seen it all before when it was better.And honestly that's because we have.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
23,stevendbeard,"Okay, Moment's Over",7,10 June 2019,"I saw ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"", starring the voices of Patton Oswalt-Veep_tv, Balls of Fury; Kevin Hart-Night School, The Wedding Ringer; Tiffany Haddish-Night School, Girls Trip and Harrison Ford-The Blade Runner movies, The Expendables 3.
This is an animated sequel to the 2016 film that starred Louis C.K. as a dog named Max. Louis C.K. has been replaced in this movie-it seems that he had some allegations in his real personal life that kind of shortened his career. Patton is the new voice of Max. There are several different story lines taking place at the same time, with Patton's owner getting married and having a child being the main one. Kevin and Tiffany-they make a good team-are on a rescue mission to save a circus animal in another story line. When Patton ends up on a vacation to visit one of his owner's relatives out in the country, he ends up meeting some new animal friends, including Harrison, an old and wise dog. FYI: This is Harrison Ford's first animated movie. If you liked the first movie, you should enjoy this one, too. As the end credits start, there are some humorous, non_animated scenes of animals interacting with kids and at the very end, you can hear a line of dialogue by Harrison but no picture-""Okay, Moment's Over.""
It's rated ""PG"" for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 26 minutes.

From its pet parakeet-swallowing dog to its cliff-diving lamb, PETS 2 is likely to disturb your little ones far more than any PET SEMATARY ever did (however much misspelled). Universal wisely chose a summer release date for PETS 2. Otherwise, this fright fest would have the young whippersnappers quaking in their boots! However, diligent parents still should conduct a family footwear inventory before exiting a showing of PETS 2, in order to find any flip flops that were frightened off during this screamer.

Whether it's geriatric cat-hoarding ladies or ravenous wolves refusing to turn back into men, PETS 2 represents a Creature Feature of the Third Degree.

29,andrewchristianjr,A GOOD ONE FOR KIDS.,7,14 July 2019,"A good one for kids. Funny, but predictable and forgettable.

30,aidanratesmovies,"Entertaining, but pointless sequel",6,21 June 2019,"Admittedly entertaining, but lacking pretty much any value, The Secret Life of Pets 2 continues Illuminations trend of recent seemingly pointless sequels. The film obviously is aimed towards a younger generation, with jokes and a fast moving plot to keep kids entertained. Its messages are conflicted and the film seems to have pretty much no story at all until it decides to combine its plot points till the end, but even then there still lives to be very little purpose for any of it. The animation itself is fairly good, and those who are reprising their voice roles continue to shine. Those who are replacing old voice actors, seem to stick out almost like a sore thumb, but overall don't take away from the film as a whole. In the end, The Secret Life of Pets 2 is a decent although definetely not needed sequel. It's obviously a cash grab, but that isn't to say it has nothing to offer, there's just so much better animated films out to see instead.

31,ShelbyTMItchell,Not as good as the first but cute,8,15 June 2019,Like one reviewer said it is not a classic but it is cute enough. While Max and Duke the main characters go to the farm as their owner is married with a son named Liam and meet a farm dog crusty yet lovable Rooster.Another story has Snowball the rabbit and Daisy a short but tough dog that rescues a white tiger from his brutal owner in the circus named Hu. While his owner and nasty dogs try to get him back along with a monkey that is Snowball's size.Third story has Chloe teaching Gidget the dog the ways of the cat and Max's on and off again girlfriend Gidget while he leaves his bumblebee toy out for her while being away.

33,rgkarim,The Fun Adventurous Side Of Pets,8,25 May 2019,"Animated films offer the opportunity for imagination to really come to life. As they bring CGI and other animation tactics to the table, the stories that follow have a big job of trying to make a film that is entertaining to all ages without dipping down one end over the other. While there are many animated studios out there ready to give it a shot, not every studio finds a way to achieve those goals, becoming a cash grab instead of a quality adventure. This week, an early showing of the The Secret Life Of Pets 2 came to screen and I had my suspicions that this sequel might have been just that. Robbie K back with another review, checking out Illumination Studios' latest work. Let's get started:Movie: The Secret Life Of Pets 2 (2019)Directors:

A Dog's PurposeSummary:
Animated films often require good voice acting to bring the characters to life, and this series' cast succeeds in bringing the plot to full life. Hart and Haddish bring their chemistry back to life in the form of Snowball and Daisy, their wild, sarcastic sass coming out beautifully in animated form. Oswalt's addition managed to bring Max to the same level as last time, fun and familiar friendliness. As for the others again they get the job done when utilized to make the same craziness that the first movie used long ago. Animation wise, it is the same caricature like style that Illumination loves to use, with grandiose character flaws and elongated, angular faces that make up their characters. As for the pets, they still have that anthropomorphized component that is so sweet to look at, each having some quality to represent the voice actors that play them. While those components are nice, the thing I enjoyed more about this installment was the pacing of the movie. Utilizing the adventurous story and splitting it into three separate segments helped keep things dynamic, moving, and fun, and avoiding those slow parts the first movie had. It's this theme that kept me entertained and seeing each subplot having its own time to play out, all the while giving the characters their focused time. Eventually all of these moments tie together, bringing the surprisingly emotional side of the film the conclusion that fit well in the theme of fun and love of pets. It definitely should strike chords with a few audience members, especially those with ties to pets.
Yet, the movie still suffers from some things that do bring some limitations for this reviewer. For one thing, the movie is still predictable and pulled no surprises in terms of story presentation. Illumination's focus on kid friendly films seems to divert from the options that will shock and amaze, due to the potential of being too sad. As such, the tale's originality and magic don't quite live up to the potential that Disney has made famous in their plethora of tales. It's cute don't get me wrong, and does have some heart pulling moments, but these are only scratching the surface that bigger studios do better. Also taking away from the tale is the short run time. Around 80 minutes long, the movie has a lot to cram in the short time, leading to very quick dives into the fun portions of the movie. However, this is also the undoing as the movie's quick pace leaves little time for impasses, obstacles, and challenges to help give significant character development. In addition, the movie could have focused a little more on some of the gimmicks they were promoting if given more time. While the characters are fun, they don't have that full dynamic and emotional range that other animated characters hold. Given that animals somehow are more emotional than humans, it would have been nice to see more of this come out, but again, this might have not fit in with the fun slapstick and writing that was built for the audience. Fan favorites from last installment may also find it disappointing to find their characters left in the kennel, particularly those who liked Pops, Mel, the Dachshund, and the Falcon as they have little outside of comedy stunts. Perhaps more time and planning could have done a bit better in adjusting these characters to have the full punch in each story.
It's no Secret this movie will do well when it opens because of the intended audience. It's cute, funny for many ages, and has that colorful animation to keep attention on them. I myself enjoyed this one better than the original due to the pacing and adventurous side of things, but I still was hoping for a little more balance and originality than what they put in. It is not the best animated in terms of pushing the limits of imagination, but it does its job and I'd say to come hit this up in theaters when you can. Otherwise, check it out later when it comes to home entertainment.My scores are:

35,yoggwork,Unsuccessful sequel,6,20 August 2019,"Compared with the first part, it has changed a lot and the quality has dropped significantly. The biggest problem, divided into three small stories and not related to each other, caused a very serious tearing. And these three stories are not lacking in kernel and new ideas. The result is that the entire film does not have a unified narrative idea, simply stacking funny fragments, the main character shaping is even reversed from the first.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
36,Abdulxoxo,Sequels suck,4,9 July 2020,This is no where as good and funny as the original was. It's so predictable and they split the gang. They even ruined the snowball character. We have seen the main villain in 30 different films. And the end train scenes is very similar to Madagascar 3 train scenes. The only good thing about this movie is the new character Rooster.Stop making sequels!!!,The Secret Life of Pets 2

We already know the characters very well so this element of fun is difficult to replicate.The movie started aimlessly, or so I thought, it then splintered into 3 separate storylines and then to my surprise came back together for the conclusion, that proved most satisfactory.This was a really great movie but you need to hang in their, the animation is brilliant and the vocal talent solid and plot well conceived.

42,RforFilm,"The Secret Life of Pets 2 is a sloppy set of plots strung together, but it's inoffensive for kids",5,17 June 2019,"Having just seen The Secret Life of Pets 2, it made me realize just how many family movies (live action and animated) really like to focus on two things: animals and seeing things from other perspectives. I like making this connection back to Disney whose entertainment philosophy had started from humanizing animals. Mickey Mouse is a walking, talking mouse. Donald Duck is a walking, talking Duck. You know what I'm getting at. Animation gives life to these characters who are now just as much people as we are, even though we know their not real. Now what about the other perspective thing?This also goes back to Disney, though lets use Pixar as an example. We've seen the world from toys, bugs, fish, robots, and even monsters eyes. The animator's hand has allowed to take these different things to show how the world works from their perspective. Because of this, many animation studios have done the same thing. In fact, when I saw the original The Secret Life of Pets, I accused it of having the same plot as Toy Story, but with not as interesting story. Can the sequel break out of that and provide something original?Sometime after the first movie, Max (played by Patton Oswalt) and Duke (played by Eric Stonestreet) have settled as friends and continue to serve their master Katie (played by Ellie Kemper). But things change when she not only marries, but has a child named Liam. The dogs end up liking Liam and do their best as a dog can. In fact, Max almost sees Liam as a surrogate son and starts to aquire anxiety from all the things that could go wrong. This results in a vet visit that puts Max in a cone. Even with that, he still suffers anxiety, so the family takes a vacation out to the country to get away from the city.At the same time, Gidget (played by Jenny Slate) is tasked with watching Max's ""Busy Bee"" toy while he's away. While doing so, she loses it in a cat lady's apartment. She gets help fro another cat Chloe to act more feline. Also at the same time, the white rabbit from the last movie Snowball (played by Kevin Hart) tries to be a superhero and gets his chance when a Shih Tzu Daisy (played by Tiffany Haddish) needs him. With all this going on in the city, Max may finally get an answer to his problems by a tough sheepdog Rooster (played by Harrison Ford).As I said, I found the first The Secret Life of Pets unoriginal, but inoffensive. Families could watch it fine and kids would probably like it. The sequel is more of the same...even though I may have liked this a little more. It has nothing to do with its jokes and characters, but rather how things are set up. The first movie had a plot of just getting home. Here, it's more of a series of events that play out until everyone comes together towards the end.In a way, I have to give them credit for trying to create something that's more of a cartoon animal slice of life. Does it all work? I don't know if I can say that. Stuff with Gidget and Snowball feel like material that was originally created for a short rather then a side plot for a movie. It's obvious as none of the other characters really communicate about their situations to each other. The only one that does connect a little is Max's problem.It's not that all the actors are not trying. In fact, I'll go as far to say that even though Patton Oswalt doesn't add a lot to Max's character, I kind of like him better here then when Louis C.K. voiced him. I even think parents may be able to relate more, as I know plenty that worry about their child's well being without realizing they need to let the kids learn for themselves every now and then. Had the movie been more about the connection with Max, Duke, and the child, I may have gone as far to recommend it. Otherwise, it's something that while a lot of kids will want to watch, I just don't see much of a reason to take them to the theater to do so.I'll give this five Shih Tzus out of ten. The Secret Life of Pets series is something that I doubt will hold much place in terms of grand animation or great comedy, but is more specifically children's entertainment. I'd give it a rental only if the kids really want to watch it. Otherwise, let the lying dog sleep.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
43,Hollywood_Yoda,Enjoyed,8,22 July 2019,"This animated film was actually enjoyable, up until one of the dog characters used the word ""pissed."" I was seeing this film in theaters with my nine-year old and he looked at me and said, ""they just cussed."" They sure did, and I was surprised the MPAA let that get by for a PG rated film. They're sure letting a lot of things go nowadays, I guess.Otherwise, the film was pretty enjoyable and a had a better story than the first Secret Life of Pets. This time around, the pets get out of the apartment and go to a farm. The farm story sort of reminded me of the Garfield Christmas special, and nostalgia kicked in. There is a character in the film with 100s of cats, and they're much like Aunt Sarah's cats, Si and Am!I'd say there will most likely be a third Secret Life of Pets in a few years.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

Harrison Ford is amazing as Rooster. Eric Stonestreet is outstanding as Duke. Jenny Slate is excellent as Gidget. Tiffany Haddish is mind-blowing as Daisy. Lake Bell is perfect as Chloe. Ellie Kemper, Pete Holmes, Henry Lynch & Nick Kroll are great as Katie, Chuck, Liam & Sergei, respectively. The supporting cast is good.

45,silvermistvio,A great pets related animation.,7,16 August 2019,"The secret life of pets 2 is a sequel of the previous animation the secret life of pets. The plot is like the previous film. It shows how the pets behave behind the owners' backs. It's like Toy Story. That's why I love this kind of animations.To be honest, the plot is kind of simple. But it's kind of turned out to be great. The characters are cute, lovely and kind of funny. I love the fact that Max becomes so brave. Rooster seems to be kind of rude outside, but he's so good inside and also he's done a good thing on Max. Because of him, Max becomes so brave as he's now.This animation shows the lovely relationship between humans and pets, especially dogs. Pets, they are really lovely if they are well tamed. They become the best friends in the world. So, I'd say this animation is really good one in the pets related films category.To conclude this review, although the plot is quite simple, but it's somehow turned out to be a great animation. And also it has some exciting moments. Thus, it's really enjoyable and I've enjoyed every seconds of it. If you love pets, I'm sure that it'd be a great animation for you.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

director: Chris Renaud
starring:Kevin Hart,Tiffany Haddish,Harrison ford, Patton Oswolt,Eric Stonestreet,Jenny Slate,Lake Bell etcoverall rating 64/100The secret life of pets 2 was a pleasently decent film with many good things going for it but it also has a fair amount of weaknesses that brings the film down.Firstly the film had excellent visuals and animation. It really makes you realise how far animated films have come as this film looked so realistic it was incredible to look at. Especially the long shots of new york the creative team really worked hard into putting every last detail into there set designs.Next the film had an excellent voice cast. Patton Oswolt did a fantastic job voicing Max again and his character arc of being to overprotective and learning to get over his fears was fun to watch. And Kevin Hart and Lake Bell were fantastic as Snowball and chloe. Kevin Hart has such a distinct and recognisable voice that you cant help but smile every time Snowball talks throughout the whole film as Kevin Hart went all out with his character and was not afraid to be over the top which just added to the charm of the adorable bunny. But i have to say i loved the introduction to the new characters of Rooster ( Harrison Ford) and Daisy ( Tiffany Haddish) Tiffany Haddish should seriously consider doing more voiceovers for animated movies as she was fantastic here. Her character was sassy and easily likeable and one of my favourite characters within the film. But Harrison Ford was the best character in the film not only was his character very funny, but he also brought a lot of wisdom and great advice to Max and the script for Roosters character was fantastic.However i would like to say a few negative things about some of the characters. Firstly Gidgit ( Jenny Slate) was really irratating to me. Her obsession with Max is old news now and they overplayed this during the film so her character really grated on me at times and her whole story with being a cat was the least interesting out of all the others. And also despite me liking Snowball as a character he was pretty useless during the film. His whole character arc was being a superhero and saving the day but when it came round to actually doing something he was pathetic and useless and Daisy usually had to do the work for him. And just when you thought he was finally getting his moment towards the end of the film its Daisys character once again that actually does all the hard work so this annoyed me slightly.Next i loved the introduction of Liam and dogs bonding with babies and younger children. I am glad that they explored this new adventure for max and his owner during the film and it was admittedly very sweet and sometimes heartwarming to see Max and Liams bond develop as this represents real life relationships so therefore the film can relate to many of the audiences members watching. I also loved the introduction of Liams dad, you would be surprised about the lack of father figures shown in animated movies but this film did it right and it also showed that its ok for men to show there sensitive side which i think is a theme that should be expressed and explored more. However there was a couple of scenes where i questioned the parenting abilities of Liams parents as they often left him to wonder around in the streets for Max to watch over which concerned me slightly.However i have to touch on my two biggest issues with the film. Firstly i thought it was extremely Reckless and insensitive for the film to have a villain that abuses animals. This would upset some families watching and its a very dark subject matter for a U rated film so i did not like this when watching and it made the villain and the overall character of the villain very old fashioned as keeping animals in the circus was made illegal many years ago it did not help as well that the villain was a cheap gru rippoff with the accent. And my other big issue with the film would be that the the film felt like 3 short films instead of a cohesive story. There was Maxes journey to the countryside, there was Daisy and Snowballs story and there was Gidget and the cats story. Aside from the beginning and some of the final act these were 3 separate stories which for me was a bit off-putting and i felt as if they could of made a better film with all the characters together for the whole 86 minutes.However i will end on my two main positives. I loved the films relatable plot points and humour. Due to having pets of my own at home i could relate to many of the situations that the owners went through during the film. Whether it was taking your dog to the vets. Or your cat doing everything to get your attention this film really did relate to me and most of the audience watching. And secondly the film was hilarious. Whether it was dogs eating cat litter. Or cats high on catnip the film actually was held together by its humour it had many running gags during the film like other illumination films that worked at getting consistent laughs a few times.Overall the secret life of pets 2 has many good qualities to it and is held together by its strong humour and voice cast but ultimately falls flat and is not on the same level as its predecessor.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
61,kermitkid,Quite a Treat,8,30 March 2020,"This is one of the rare times a sequel to an animated film is better than the original. This is what I was thinking the first movie was going to be. It's not really a plot driven movie, it's more like 3 different, separate storylines that feel like a TV show pilot, but that's not a bad thing, because in this movie it works. Kevin Hart is still one of the best parts of this movie, and the addition of Harrison Ford adds a bit of dry humor, and I wish they had used him more. At its core, this is a very sweet movie about pets and their humans, and it has a lot of heart put into it. The plot does have some issues towards the end with just how off-the-wall unbelievable it gets, and it didn't really need to go the direction it did, because at that point it was hard to suspend my disbelief, even for a movie like this. The story for the first 2 acts is fairly straightforward and simple, but then the 3rd act feels like a completely different movie. I laughed a couple of times, but this movie is definitely more for kids. Adults may enjoy some of it, but really, this is made just to shut your kids up for 90 minutes. It's enjoyable, and I recommend it, but don't expect much story.

This is astounding. They are actually Knights with a chivalrous code. This is a hilarious movie a wondrous romp. Do you recall pets that you have or known others that have? They are great. While in theater I note how there's lots of clever bits of how pets are like how a cat gets catnip while some far-out hippie tune plays about a White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland, how another cat tears a whole side of a sofa going down its side. HAhahahhaaaaaaaaa!? Another thing is this movie ft. 3 storylines that eventually converge together. The metropolitan setting now gets a country angle too.

All the characters are back, plus a new addition, Rooster, voiced by Harrison Ford (his first-ever animated film) which serves for many funny interactions between his deadpan, serious and tough character and Patton Oswalt's Max, who does his best to impress him.

70,bastos,Bland and forgettable but harmless,5,23 October 2020,"Usually Illumination movies do nothing for me. I don't like the Despicable Me series and their other movies always feel meh and are very very forgettable. Case in point I can't remember almost anything from the first movie! So, to the surprise of no one, I found this movie meh and forgettable. The storyline is very disjointed and feels like they had ideas for three different shorts but decided to cram it all up in one movie. It had its moments, for sure, and the voice talent was good, I guess, and in what was surely a creative decision (ahem ahem) they decided to replace the voice of the main character with Patton Oswalt, which was ok.

The fact that the circus story has been added hasn't bothered me much except for the fact that with the bad wolves and the evil Russian there had to be stereotypical enemies again to give the audience (the usual) someone to hate. Nevertheless, since the premise was finally fulfilled and in a very funny and entertaining way, I liked it a lot, way to go (except for the seemingly obligatory bashing).",The Secret Life of Pets 2

75,AdrenalinDragon,The Filler Life of Pets,3,24 May 2019,"A very large chunk of The Secret Life of Pets 2 is pointless and dumb. The movie focuses on three different sets of characters in three different plots, and two of them are entirely filler. It reaches the credits at around the 80 minute mark and I'd say about 20 minutes of the runtime is the actual plot (Snowball and the Circus Tiger). Worst of all, the main character Max gets the least amount of screentime and his subplot contributes almost nothing aside from hearing Harrison Ford voice an animal. The Cat subplot is just there for stupid gags and contributes nothing as well.It really felt like three different episodes or short films stitched together to make it feature length and you know what it wouldn't be so bad if it was at least entertaining to watch. Sadly, the jokes are not funny at all and the whole thing is bland and uninspiring. Honestly, for me it made the first Secret Life of Pets seem not too bad in comparison. At least that one had structure and felt like an actual movie even if it wasn't original. The Secret Life of Pets 2 didn't even entertain the kids in my cinema so I consider it a waste of time and easily one of Illumination's worst movies.2.5/10",The Secret Life of Pets 2

I did laugh out loud a couple of times.Gidget was my favorite character out of all of them, she definitely had the funniest moments and had the best personality and dialogue out of all the characters in the movie behind Max.

Also the bunny helps a dog free a tiger.Secret Life Of Pets 2 was a huge bundle of action and comedy. The comedy I have to say was top notch. It was probably more funny than the first one. The voice acting was great too. I actually enjoyed Tiffany Haddish in this movie. Most movies I find her to be annoying. Also the animation looked great. There were many scenes were a house or a mountain looked completely real and out there. The things I didn't like were all the stories that you had to follow. They should have just kept it on two. Three is way too much. Also the end was weird. They all magically wanted the same thing.Overall, Secret Life Of Pets 2 was a funny and action packed movie for the whole family.

83,Reckno64,"The poster told me ""Don't Laugh"" and believe me, I didn't laugh once!!!",3,12 June 2019,"With all due respect to people's opinions, this movie was just so forgettable and at times, unwatchable.On the ""good"" side, the animation is fine, the voice acting is fine, the messages are....fine for the most part? I like the message to not be too overprotective of the people you care about but not totally on board with the ""don't be afraid to take risks"" message when Max puts himself in danger for the sake of saving a sheep. There were a few bits I almost laughed, and I genuinely liked SOME of the characters (Max and Rooster being the 2 most likeable), but for the most part there is just nothing of note or substance. The villain is so forgettable and cookie cutter I have already forgotten his name, and I saw this movie just a couple hours ago! The other thing I really dislike about this movie is how safe it is. No risks were taken. The biggest ""risk"" I saw was Max's rescue mission and the villain's last stand, where he appears to pull an ACTUAL gun. Not to worry though a car comes in conveniently and runs him over. Perfect timing......as always for animated kids films. And to cap it off, we get Kevin Hart rapping as the bunny he plays and an end credits scene that is just videos of pets.....where is the effort???3/10 is probably too generous. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's just.....painfully average. I KNOW Illumination can do better. Their first Despicable Me movie was pretty good, the second was decent, and I even liked the Lorax movie for taking a pretty big risk in making a new ending. Not a good movie, but I REALLY appreciated it for taking some big risks. This movie is risk free, forgettable, and somewhat painful to sit through.In the end it is a family film, and I am a fully grown adult so what do I know? Kids will love it, and some adults will probably enjoy it a bit too. But if you're looking for animated films with passion and effort put into them, stick to DreamWorks and Disney/Pixar. They actually CARE about the quality of their product and even if the movie ends up being somewhat a miss, the effort is still clearly there, and I can always appreciate a good effort. I paid 5 dollars to see this, but even that wasn't worth it to me.At the end if you enjoyed it, more power to you. This is just my opinion. I'm happy people still enjoy these movies, but I am likely to stick with Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks movies when it comes to animation. Toy Story 4 here we go!EDIT: Settled on changing it to a 2, after changing to a 1. It isn't the WORST animated movie, but it sure was forgettable. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry. It was just another animated movie to me, which is unfortunate because I really gave it a chance, even knowing it'd be a weak movie. But it really is my least favorite Illumination movie to date for now.....",The Secret Life of Pets 2

93,valen060,"You Can't Teach An Old Dog New Tricks, But There's More Bite To It",8,26 July 2019,"Back in 2016, The Secret Life of Pets was an impressive animated flick done by Illumination and Universal outside of its Despicable Me franchise. Now for it to spawn a sequel three years later, which continues the adventures of Max and Duke, it's great to see several familiar faces and hear the reprisal of voice actors return as they head to the countryside.While Max and Duke live contently with their loving owner Katie, things change when Max begins to express odd behavior as change isn't working out too well for him. They then decide to embark on a trip to the countryside to get away from the stress of the big city, while at the same time his friends back home have their own personal dilemmas.Like the original, this movie has its share of slapstick and comedic moments that are similar to the gags in Looney Tunes, but at the same time it approaches the movie differently in terms of story. It felt more like three separate segments which would later intertwine with each other at the climax. The casting of Patton Oswalt as Max in place of comedian Louis C.K. gave me a mixed feeling when hearing his take on the main dog, but I overlooked it to stay focused on how the whole movie would play out. Newcomers like Harrison Ford (his only notable voice role) as farm dog Rooster is a welcoming addition and the witty humor of Tiffany Haddish as Daisy could potentially be the new scene stealer alongside Kevin Hart (returning as the witty rabbit Snowball).Though it didn't quite capture the charm as the original, it's still entertaining and funny enough to see what these characters have been up to since their last adventure. It even provides some morals that I found noticeable when you think of it. Might feel routine for adults, but kids will remain occupied with it. It's a fun one.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

'Cats are selfish creatures who cough up disgusting furballs and purposefully wreck your computer, but occasionally do something unintentionally stupid you can giggle at, which makes them acceptable pets.'Compare and contrast with the almost reverential treatment handed out to dogs, and the gaping disparity is not so hard to miss.I get it. In Hollywood: Dogs = Good, trusting, loyal companions.Cats = Evil, sneaky, treacherous, conniving sociopaths.It's just so predictably boring. And untrue, of course.Still, I've learned to rise above the nonsense, and will rate the flick for what it is: A Just About Tolerable Selection Of Bland Sketches Vaguely Connected To A Wisp Of A Plot Full Of Poop And Pee Jokes.Now, that's what I call succinct.

96,williamsonandcompany,Good second film but wish the story was better,8,19 September 2019,"This was a good second movie to the series but I wish they stuck to the same characters that were popular verses bringing in more. The new dog and the big cat story was weak. It would have gotten a better score from me if they used more scenes from the original team. The other building pets weren't used much, and the story should have focused more around the local area instead of adding the whole circus story. I would still watch it again and recommend to kids and adults for entertaining movie with good ending. Too many movies have bad ones these days that leave audiences dealing more depressed than entertained. Also the main character switch was great choice since the other was a strange guy in real life",The Secret Life of Pets 2
97,eparazak,"It may entertain kids, but Secret Life 2 is an unnecessary, generic sequel that is filled with fluff.",4,13 June 2019,"The Secret Life of Pets 2 is Illumination's latest film after Despicable Me 3, and it takes place a few years after the previous film. In it, Max and Duke go on vacation to the countryside with their owner and her newfound family. Alongside this, the other pets in New York City get into other shenanigans while the two are away.The original Secret Life of Pets was honestly nothing special, at least to me. It felt like an enjoyable experience for younger moviegoers that keeps them quiet for an hour and a half. I will admit that the sequel has its charms. As an adult viewer, I got quite a few laughs from the film, as it has its unpredictably funny and silly moments. I thought Patton Oswalt did a great job as the replacement for Max. The animation was still very lively and larger than life, which fits the film's tone. Finally, the movie has some great messages for kids that they can take home after the film ends.Despite these positive aspects, I had quite a few problems with the film. My biggest problem with it is with the story. After the first act, the movie divides its plot into three different stories. All of these stories are some of the most cookie-cutter, basic plots I've seen in an animted film, even from a movie from Illumination. They're all so safe and predictable, and they even feel tacked on to pad the film. The way these plots come together by the end also feel forced and unnatural. The one good thing I can say about the story, however, is that, unlike the original film, it doesn't rehash Toy Story's plot.There really isn't that much to say about a movie as generic as this one. If I were to review the original Secret Life of Pets, I could say a lot more about it. This movie on the other hand is extremely forgettable and completely unnecessary. This is all-in-all a harmless sequel on the other hand, and I feel like kids will enjoy it. This movie, however, could not be more generic even if it tried.4/10",The Secret Life of Pets 2

I knew that it wasn't going to be a great movie, or a decent one.. because the trailer showed almost everything about the plot, which is not the movie's fault, but even the plot isn't interesting or catchy, it was really disappointing, because the movie tried to be something more than what it is, it sometimes took itself seriously, not all the time, but more often, but the plot was so weak to do so, so the movie suffered a lot from that!I was disappointed after watching The Secret Life of Pets 2, it was so much like 3 mini-movies combined together until the third act that reunites all of them again for a plot that really wasn't that interesting at the first place! The movie is not terrible, don't get me wrong, it has some few good things too, still, not enough to save this movie.. unfortunately, 'cause I really wanted this movie to be good.Let's start with the pros of this movie: The animation is good, not that much improved, but it's fine.The ""plot"" of Max and Duke is really good, I really wanted more of it. Harrison Ford is just.. AMAZING!! I loved him, he added so much to this movie, he's my favorite part of this movie, every scene Roster (voiced by Ford) was in it, it was really impressive! He was really cool, I really loved him!Let's move to the cons:
Some of the jokes were flat, kids in my theater were laughing so hard sometimes, but for adults, it didn't work out very well.. there were a couple of good scenes though, but the rest, it wasn't that funny. The movie had one target, to make kids laugh, and it did that very well, but for adults, it really dragged down on that!There's a character named Daisy in the movie, and I hated her!!!! It's her script, the character is so flat, nothing good about her, and it being said, because she's there for quite sometime!As I said the story wasn't that good, the movie isn't for all the family actually, it targets the kids and that's it! But I enjoyed myself sometimes! Overall The Secret Life of Pets 2 was disappointing but still, I enjoyed some of it.

It's not even a complete movie although it has many laughs. Still, the first one was better! Average try!",The Secret Life of Pets 2
100,Clank_Zoka,Well That was Slightly Surprising..,7,26 May 2019,"The first Secret Life of Pets could of been amazing, from the teaser trailer and some of the trailers, could be one of the biggest surprises of the year, however it turned out to be disappointing, but still good, it has wonderful animation, great voice-acting, excellent dialogue and a fun story with heart, it's not quite one of the Illumination's best but it's still a enjoyable family flick!, so I was quite excited for the sequel which I think should be better then what the first did, so I saw the movie yesterday here in the UK, (sorry US, you'll have to wait for a few weeks till it's out) it got released yesterday and.... it was actually better, not by much but a improvement, so let's talk about it.Max (Patten Oswald, instead of Louis C.K) and the gang are back in this new adventure!, Max and Duke (Eric StoneStreet) are going to the farm with Katie (Ellie Kemper), her new husband Chuck and their only child Liam who Max is very attached to and will protect him from any danger, while that's going on, Snowball (Kevin Hart) is now a hero instead of a villain, his mission is to help Daisy (Tiffany Haddish) rescue this tiger named Hu from the Circus leader named Sergei (Nick Kroll) and his sidekick Little Sergei, finally Gidget is asked to look after Max's Busy Bee toy, but after losing it to a apartment of cats, Gidget has to learn how to act like a cat to get the toy back, so as you can tell there is so much going on, just like any other animated sequel really, it just loses focus and all of it's sub plot are loosely connected, each one is focused on one mission, however I was interested in all of them, except the Gidget subplot which is made for comedy, while it is funny, it has no purpose and it's quite pointless, however the other two are so much more interesting, Max and Duke meet a new character named Rooster (Harrison Ford.... I'm not kidding) and with Rooster's help, Max's side is more meaningful, learning not to be scared and have faith in yourself, it's funny, cute and it makes the movie have a purpose, Snowball's plot is more action packed and exciting!, which makes the movie goes by quickly while I was having fun, not to mention a really great third act, sure the writing is weak and the plot is very predicable and quite rushed with not much new material to work with, but the writers and Chris Renaud did the best they can with a sequel like this.The animation still remains the same, but still just as wonderful as the first movie, it still has strong character designs, character animation, lovely background of New York City, it has energy and a lot of colour to it, so the animation still looks amazing even not much as changed, as for the new elements, they also work as well, I like the action scenes that involve Snowball at the Circus, Max at the farm, there's always something visually pleasant about these scenes, it always makes the animation go above and beyond what Illumination can truly do, that and with some new characters, their designs stand out very well like Daisy Rooster and the Wolves, the animation may still remain the same, with a few minor changes but it's just as beautiful as it was before.The characters are fun and memorable for the most part, Max is actually more likeable and fun, he has to learn to how to not be afraid and have faith, since he wants to protect Liam from any harm, he's still funny and charming as he was before and his purpose here makes more sense, I liked Max a lot more here then the first movie and still one of my favourite, Duke is just there for comedy purposes, still funny and entertaining but not much to him, Snowball has a bigger role here, instead of a antagonist, he is a superhero, he's still funny, crazy, enjoyable and more likeable, he's still my favourite character here, now for Rooster who is just awesome and funny, he helps Max find his confidence and he's a lot of fun, he's also another favourite character of mine in this movie, as for everyone else, you can just remove them and it wouldn't change a thing, Chloe (Lake Bell), Mel (Bobby Moynihan), Buddy (Hannibal Buress) are pointless and don't do much expect comedy, Gidget may still be cute and funny but there isn't too much to her and her subplot is pointless, Pops (Dana Carvey) is only in there for a few minutes and that's pretty much it, Liam I guess has a purpose, while he is the child of Katie and Chuck, he doesn't all that much expect like a dog like Max and Duke, Katie isn't the movie as much so she doesn't do much and Chuck is just the same, Daisy is a okay new character as a supporting character who helps Snowball rescue Hu, as for Hu, he is quite cute and has a great character design, the villains are actually alright, as for our first actual human antagonist, Sergei is threatening and interesting, but not a whole lot to him, same can be said about his sidekick Little Sergei, he doesn't say anything which is strange and he's with Sergei incase trouble goes down, the wolves are more supporting antagonists, the voice acting is pretty solid I think, I was okay with Patten Oswald as Max, not distracting and it's quite close to Louis C.K's voice, he is great as always like he was In Ratatouille as Remy, Eric Stonestreet is still really fun as Duke, Jenny Slate is cute as Gidget, Lake Bell is still a perfect choice for Chloe, Kevin Hart is hilarious as Snowball, Bobby Moynihan and Hannibal Buress are charming as Mel and Buddy, Tiffany Haddish is also very cute and likeable as Daisy, Harrison Ford is surprisingly great as Rooster, lastly Nick Kroll is threatening as Sergei, Dana Carvey is still funny as Pops, Ellie Kemper is fine as Katie and everyone else does their job fine, the characters are a mixed bag, some are fun, memorable, meaningful and funny, the rest are pointless, but thanks to the voice acting, it doesn't quite take away the pointlessness.Well.... not quite what I wanted but it is close to what I want in a way, the Secret Life of Pets 2 is a surprisingly pretty good sequel to the first movie, slightly better and it has improved, not majorly, but it's still a improvement, it's still funny, the story has more meaning to it and it has two subplots that are fun and interesting, the animation is just as strong as the first movie, the new characters are fun, and some of the old characters are still funny and entertaining!, however it's easily predictable with far too much going on and Gidget's Subplot is pointless, it does feel rushed and not much new material is added here, that and some of the recurring characters don't do a lot in the movie expect do it for comedy purposes, but the voice acting does save these recurring characters from being completely pointless, if you want a simple but fun animated family film, then give this one a watch, if you like the first movie you'll most likely like this one, or if you like Illumination you'll like this one, you don't really need to watch the first movie in order the watch this since it doesn't have a lot connected to the first movie, but if you hate the first movie and Illumination then you'll dislike this movie, while it's not great, I mean far from it, but it's not bad either, just pretty good.I'm going to give Secret Life of Pets 2 a 7.7/10.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

104,jaywensley2004,Modern Parenting Fables,6,7 June 2019,"It turns out that in their secret lives, our pets fancy themselves as parents.Not just to their own kittens, pups and fledglings, but to our children. And in one special instance, to a Siberian White Tiger cub. This latter though, is the undoing of ""The Secret Life of Pets 2.""For the most part, ""Secret Life 2"" serves as a collection of fables that illustrate various parenting styles. While it quickly becomes evident that some of the pets-as-parents are crazy, it's all in good fun, and told with some bright humor. Some of the would-be parents even demonstrate sufficient self-awareness to understand that they can do with a few lessons for themselves. Such is the case for lead-character Max, who recognizes in Rooster (voiced by Harrison Ford in a star-turn that proves what a great star he is) a role-model for Max's own efforts to be a proxy parent for Liam, the new, human addition to Max's family.As an aside, Rooster is the best thing about ""Secret Life."" The character not only brings much needed sanity to the movie, Ford, as the voice of the character, delivers a line of savvy, salient dialogue so expertly, that I was bent over with laughter for the next minute. No spoilers, but listen carefully when Rooster explains the value of biting into an electrical cord.Anyway, ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" provides a sweet, and pretty convincing argument that, if a parent truly has good intent, everything will turn out just fine.Except for that white tiger cub. The rescue of that cub from an evil circus operator becomes the central tale in ""Secret Life"", and the writers let the ""tiger in the room"" trap them into a corner from which there is no escape. Again, no spoilers, but the question of what to do with a tiger cub once you have saved it is, in the real-world setting of ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"", crucial to a satisfying ending. What we get is absolute insanity. Ultimately, this breach of logic destroys all hope that viewers will succeed in suspending disbelief so sufficiently, as to allow us to enjoy the cross-over between real-world New York, and the fantasy of animals as metaphor for parenting.Animated movies are becoming one of the best reasons to see a movie in a theater, and ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" is another strong argument for going to the cineplex. The sets and backgrounds are breathtakingly realistic, even as they present a world that is just sparkly and clean enough to be a fantasy we want to live in. And the textures and lighting do justice to the name of the studio--Illumination--that produced the movie.There's a few scenes that are very intense, and a couple that may be too thematically dark to be comfortable for young children. But ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" is very much a kids movie. This adult found much to smile about, and several good laughs, but at the end, I was frustrated and dissatisfied, by an adorable tiger cub.I rate ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" Six Stars, BUT... Ten Stars for Harrison Ford. Being able to only hear, without seeing him, speaking lines, is a revelation. For all these years, I never realized how great, how important, his delivery is.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

The main focus on the film is based on an emotional aspect in life, I just wish it focused on getting the main story correct and done good rather than trying to dabble in a few different scenarios or situations.

Everyone laughed at the fat purple cat giving the fluffy white dog and her dog friends cat lessons and the old cat lady in the buick.The best plot is daisy and snowball trying to help an adorable white tiger escape from an abusive owner and find a forever home.This part might be a little scary for little kids and the old dog sounded like he said a bad word at one point but I am sure if he did or not.

121,TheJohnnyPHreak,Hilarious Fun Family Sequel For Pets & Kids Alike,7,26 May 2019,"Do you have a pet? Did you ever want to know if they are just like us? If they do things odd when we humans are not around? If any of those questions crossed your mind then The film to see was The Secret Life of Pets. It was a fun, animated adventure about a few pets in the city of New York. With the success of that first film comes the sequel The Secret Life of Pets 2 where those same questions are further explored. And new questions are brought up. For any pet lover, this film is definitely for you. If you are a parent, your kids are going to love this film as well. But also anyone with a sense of humor and a heart will laugh out loud through most of this film. And maybe even get a few feels.This sequel takes place not too far after the first film ends. Max (now voiced by Patton Oswalt, instead of Louis C.K.) Duke (Eric Stonestreet from Modern Family) and Katie (Ellie Kemper). But when Katie by happenstance meets Chuck (Pete Holmes) they get married, he moves in and eventually they have a son named Liam. At first, Max is apprehensive but he then comes to be Liam's protector. Max's protection and nerves are put to the test when the family heads out to a family farm where Max meets an alpha dog named Rooster (voiced by Harrison Ford). Meanwhile, Snowball (Kevin Hart), Gidget (Jenny Slate) and Chloe (Lake Bell) get into some hijinks of their own when they meet a new dog Daisy (Tiffany Haddish).The whole original cast comes back for the sequel with a few new voice actors that I have mentioned. Being that this is a sequel, the story does pull focus a bit on certain groups of characters. It's much like an Avengers movie when multiple stories are all happening at once. But it comes together well on screen and all makes seen. Even coming to a head at the end of the film in a very hilarious way. The whole cast is excellent with Harrison Ford being a stand out in a small role. But much like the first film Hart & Slate's characters get the best moments. I find it amusing that an animated feature lets these comedic actors flex their muscles and they shine. Oswalt replacing C.K. works well and fits well with the story. Its almost as if they built the story around him, playing to his acting strengths.The animation is done in a very interesting way. It's much like the Illumination style that they have gone with the Minions and Despicable Me series. Lots of long characters and the characters that get the focus of the story get fleshed out the best. It doesn't take away from the experience but it is noticeable. Thankfully none of the characters are the same. They each stand out and get their own moments. Co-directors Chris Renaud and Jonathan del Va (who doesn't get credited at the end of the film) know how to place a joke that kids will get and follow that up with a joke that will go over well with the adults in the audience. 90% of the gags land well, some even kill better than can be expected. I found myself hysterically laughing at a few of the gags.The film does have a nice message of stepping out of your comfort zone and asking for help. There are a few moments when you can see these animals have issues that mirror humans, especially kids growing up. But it's a nice universal message or two that parents should take to heart as well. The film doesn't beat you over the head with it either. It's still pretty damn funny and entertaining all the while having a little something to say. Also, it's nice to see an animated feature where there are no songs or characters singing. The film follows a few interwoven stories and doesn't need a song to push it along. (Although, after the credits, there is a hilarious musical moment with one of the main character, I can take that because I was crying laughing)The Secret Life of Pets 2 doesn't reinvent the wheel on animated features, but it does what the first film did best. It's an entertaining, funny animated feature with a great cast of actors and actresses who keep the story going. Their characters are great, the setting and animation are interesting. I enjoy the first film but this second film had me rolling in laughter. I can definitely see the film getting a third chapter. Everything that the first film does well, this second feature improves upon. I would call that a success in the sequel film world.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
122,CinematicGarbage,A Chaotic Sequel! (5.9/10),2,8 June 2019,"The First Secret Life of Pets had been a Toy Story Movie...with pets and I'm not satisfied with that but how the story went like was fine and I actually wasn't disappointed. And this year, we have the sequel. Yeah, that's right, there're more new characters and also new bad guys coming. The sequel was a bit disappointing to me.This time, Max started to be different. The original voice of Max changed to another actor and when I hear the different voice, I found it laughably bad for example:
""Rooster: Are you afraid?Max: No, No I'm Not!""I could see the difference and it's negative. The other casts acted like pets as well: they did little talking, especially Kevin Hart, most of his screentime, he kept screaming like a bunny trying to be Captain Snowball. He went like: 'YAAAAAAAA!' but he still kept the humor we all wanted. When it got the vet scene, the other animals went like chaos, especially the hamster in the wheel and the grey cat with green eyes.Moreover, many characters in here which were kinda main in the first movie and now they just switched roles like Gidget, she was one of the main characters in 2016 but in here, she played a minor role. She didn't even have that much screentime and all she did was just being a catdog. Let's talk about Indiana Jones playing the Rooster. Ford did good at that role but the problem is that he also didn't have enough screentime and there's one scene that I felt they had to make the dog say goodbye to Max and Duke before they leave the farm. That scene was carelessly handled. Duke was also the ones who switched role to minor and so was Pops. He taught young dogs how to be...dogs. These characters switched their roles in a horrible way and I was disappointed. The villains here didn't have enough screentime either.We had the first movie to be like Toy Story and now The Secret Life of Pets 2 looked like Toy Story 2 with an adventure outside their owner's house and Stinky Pete looked like the Circus guy which was a bad guy. Most of the scenes are literally boring and they had a slight piece of entertainment in here. Most of the scenes here had the kinds of rap or pop music which didn't match them, not even a sound just like the first trailer, they had this ""Walk it Out"" song which I felt really annoyed and I thought the first trailer was horrible. They also had this bad idea to turn Katie and her husband's child named Liam to be a dog. He wanted to dig, to pee and various things Max and Duke could do.I really think these people could do better than just switching roles without knowing the result, screaming all the time. If I was in this movie, I would say ""If y'all want to get Crazy, we can get Crazy!"". Everyone's acting like chaos is in New York and the humans did not know it (well some did). This is also one of the disappointing sequels I saw this year.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

Because of that coupled with the knowledge that most sequels rarely live up to the first we weren't too keen on seeing ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" but since it is still an Illumination film and they have such a great track record, we decided that since everyone deserves a second chance we would go ahead and watch it.I can't really say the animation is better because when you're already at the top, you do your best to, at a minimum, ""maintain"" which they did. This time around, we found ourselves laughing a lot. Yes...Illumination is back! There were a few different storylines to follow each one funny in their own right.And what a cast...from Kevin Hart & Tiffany Haddish, Patton Oswalt, Eric Stonestreet, and Dana Carvey to the rest...they were all great but this time around they also added another dog named ""Rooster"" voiced by Academy Award nominee Harrison Ford.So glad we decided to have faith in Illumination and saw this movie...we haven't laughed like that in a long time.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

Not being too apprehensive ""parents"" is a good message and in general the film often makes you smile.

It actually really surprised me by being cute, sentimental and just being quick moving entertainmen. What the movie does really well is that it's just unassuming fun. It has no greater ambitions and it stays inside of it's length. It understands that we want to watch this movie to see pets doing kind of weird shenanigans. The movie is not really story driven. Each of our main characters have their own plotline and they all kind of merge together in the third act for the big action slam-band finale. At the end of the day I think the movie delivers the fun that it's supposed to, there's a bunch of memorable characters inside of it, in particulae the little bunny played by Kevin Hart as well as Harrison Ford's rooster. Overall this is a movie I enjoyed and I wouldn't mind rewatching it",The Secret Life of Pets 2

It's got plenty of adult references in it, but nothing original, and not at all funny.I rarely write negative reviews, but I would really like them to stop pushing this franchise, cause it's already dead. Not saying that I have that kind of power, but you do what you can.Obviously talented people put a lot of time and effort in to the animation, and it looks decent. Problem is, the characters are uninteresting and the story is just plain awful. And what's up with the stereotypes? Dogs eat shoes/cats chase laserpens etc. Does that really pass as humor anymore?

It's actually quite funny for adults too, it has some good in jokes, and as I can genuinely attain, withstands MUCH more repeated watching than the How To Train Your Dragon series.I despised this movie at first, but it's nowhere near as bad as people say, and Pops, and a death metal poodle, make it all worthwhile.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

All the little subtle jokes hit home base because I myself have witnessed all the things that cats and dogs do that make you laugh. So my conclusion is either I was not in the right frame of mind the first time I watch the movie or maybe I was stoned and didn't realize it from something I ate...LOL...Magic mushrooms maybe?

164,sarahelizabeth-68258,HILARIOUS for kids and adults,9,7 January 2020,"This movie was full of goofy stuff that both kids and adults can enjoy. Lots of funny and harmless stereotypes, such as a crazy cat lady and Max, the very stereotypical dog. Each animal has their own unique personality which is stuck to throughout the film, and a few new characters are introduced that were not in the previous movie. Three plots go on at the same time in the movie, but they all come together perfectly for the ending and the three plots don't crowd each other out. Gidget is especially hilarious as she infiltrates there cat lady's home and is accepted among the cats (I won't spoil how). Loved watching it on my own and then again with my mother in law, but I'm sure kids would absolutely adore this movie. The profanity is nothing to worry about. ""Jerk"" ""dope"" etc is something elementary school kids say and/or hear on a daily basis, and hearing dogs say it to each other in mostly friendly or comedic context isn't harmful. The only thing that might be more concerning is when a dog says that a puppy was ""pissed"" that the tiger ate a flat screen TV.This was a bit frightening for a kids show. At the end, the ""bad guy"" had a gun and was going to shoot one or all of the animals there, but a car hit him before he could do anything. Really unexpected for a kids movie. He also had a taser not long before that which he was going to hurt the tiger with to force him to do tricks. This movie might really scare kids away from the circus due to the intensity of the bad character ( a ringmaster), his wolves, and just the fear associated with the circus in this movie.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

What impressed me the most is that the movie was full of many meaningful messages for everyone, especially the younger ones. We are growingly witnessing that the new generation is constantly growing apart from the traditional values and wisdom of the society and as a consequence the day to day life is becoming increasingly dangerous and ruthless.I would highly recommend everyone to enjoy this movie with the whole family and spread the word if you also feel that there should be more such movies with important life lessons rather than focusing on just pure entertainment value.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

Gidget loses max balls so she has to rescue it from the cats
Max and Duke end up on a farm and meet a dog called rooster this part was so boring to me
Then a new dog comes along and wants snowballs help to rescue a tiger from the circus.Dont get me wrong its not a bad movie and Kevin Hart is the main star and is still funny as the little bunny snowball going away from him i do not remember Duke even speaking that much in this film.I was expecting so much more from this I was not expecting it to be this poorly delivered the first movie made sense this one lost the plot completely.

Wolves are treated as stupid, useless, circus hounds, a species lower than dogs and obedient and tame even when let off their chains-clearly someone didn't do their research. The humor is generic, the troubles characters face predictable and there is really nothing memorable about this movie.

183,askrapitsalex,A funnier and entertaining improvement,9,8 June 2019,"While the Despicable Me franchise continues to reign as the commercially successful non-Disney animated franchise, Illumination gives the sequel treatment to their previous projects, including The Secret Life of Pets.Looking back at the first film, I still find it cute for its interesting premise, colorful animation, catchy musical score and a cast of memorable, side characters. My only issue(s) were that the plot was predictable and Max & Duke, while not intolerable, didn't leave much an impression for me.However, my expectations began to blossom ever since the marketing for the sequel came out. After months of anticipation, the movie took me by surprise on how much it improved.The sequel has three stories:
1. After Katie got married and has a son, Max (Patton Oswalt) became overprotective of his new playmate and must learn to overcome his fears.
2. Gidget (Jenny Slate) tries to rescue Max's favorite toy from an apartment room full of cats.
3. Reformed villain Snowball (Kevin Hart) dons a superhero alter-ego and must save a tiger from an abusive circus owner (Nick Kroll).In hindsight, the plot would sound like a mess and have a lack of focus on which story to follow. In practice, however, the stories intertwine pretty well and does deliver an entertaining and intense climax in the third act. The plot is one of the major improvements over the original. The stories are more character-driven and sticks more close to the title of the franchise more than Max & Duke's buddy-comedy journey, which took majority of the first. The comedy is also a set-up from the predecessor where the jokes are more hit than miss. In fact, laughed out more than chuckling a few times in the past.One of the highlights of any Illumination movie is the animation. Sure, some may argue that the Illumination animation quality and the character designs are too simplistic and doesn't visually stand out comparing to other animation studios. As an animator myself, I sense that the animators continue using heavy emphasis on shape on the animals' design that are executed well in their movements and humor. You can tell the animators had fun referencing how the animals move and behave, and animate them to their full potential. As for the setting for New York City, it retains its colorful appeal from the first film. They also added new scenery to give a different atmosphere from a pet's perspective. It can whether Max & Duke visiting the upstate farmland or Snowball venturing through the carnival fairgrounds. For the latter, it also provided some decent and energized action sequences.Most of the characters return and they are still likable and funny, thanks to the actors' performances. There are couple of characters worth mentioning. I'll start off with Max. First, he is now voiced by Patton Oswalt replacing Louis C.K. after exposing his...history. He is, for the most part, a fitting replacement. But, there are times when his voice can be a little noticeable since both said actors have different pitches and deliveries. Outside his performance, Max goes through a major character development where he and Duke become friends with Katie's son, Liam. But, Max slowly and progressively becomes brave and less worried. I consider Max to be more likable than he was last time. Snowball went through a major transition from villain to a happily living as a pet while determining to helping others as a superhero (though at times, pretends for fun). As the for the new characters, they are mostly welcoming additions and provide their own charm. The only exception(s) that I felt weren't interesting enough were Katie's husband Chuck and son Liam. Again, not bad characters, they didn't leave much of an impression. On Snowball's side of the plot, we have Daisy, a kind-hearted Shih Tzu who idolizes Snowball's alter-ego and wants to be like him. Hu, the captive white tiger that gives out more personality than words with behaving like a house cat and having a childlike innocence. If I had to pick two of my favorite new additions of the pack, it would be Rooster and Sergei. Rooster (voiced the first time and remarkably well by Harrison Ford) is the farmdog that acts as Max's mentor on how to overcoming fears. I'd classify Sergei as the most menacing villain in Illumination history for his dark and threatening design and nature, comparing to the comedic, over-the-top villains from other movies.Overall, The Secret of Life of Pets 2 is a major improvement over the first film, thanks to a well-thought out story, appealing animation, good laughs and great performances. If you are an animal lover, Illumination fan, or have kids, I'd definitely recommend this movie. It'll be fun to sit through and a good appetizer before Toy Story 4.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

190,wadben-78610,Pointless Sequel,4,1 August 2019,These movies are just mindless copies of Toy Story which follows the general illumination trend of having as low a budget as they can to appeal to an audience of children who will laugh at any old squishy yellow children. It follows three story lines. Only 2 of these matter to the story and the other just pads out run time. Its villian is so mediocre with no motivation and is the least recognisable part of it.

192,cjessup-92910,These dogs haven't learned any new tricks,5,12 June 2019,"I wasn't a fan of the first Secret Life of Pets movie. It was predictable, all the laughs were in the trailers, and the plot structure itself was a wannabe Toy Story. The trailers for its sequel weren't any more promising, but I went in open-minded. Unfortunately, it was more of the same.In Secret Life of Pets 2, terrier Max (Patton Oswalt) is coping with some major life changes. His owner is now married and has a toddler, Liam. Max is so worried about protecting the boy that he develops a nervous tic. On a family trip to a farm, Max gets some guidance from veteran farm dog Rooster (Harrison Ford, making his animated-film debut), who pushes Max to ditch his neuroses, find his inner alpha, and give Liam a little more freedom.Don't get me wrong, these aren't terrible movies. The most unsatisfying part of these films is just how mediocre they are. There's plenty of laughs and fun hijinks, but it's all so empty and meaningless. In my opinion, that's what separates most Illumination animated films from their Disney and Pixar counterparts.The story of Secret Life of Pets 2 is less structured than the previous film. So many storylines are juggled that you nearly forget one before you reach the next relevant scene. Several times in the course of watching it, I wondered how much more enjoyable this concept would be as a streaming TV show or a miniseries. Low stakes, unrelated events, and a shorter runtime would do this franchise well. The full-bellied laughs that start out the film are half-hearted chuckles by the end.The voice cast is fine, but not nearly as relevant or impactful as other animated films. The animation is well done, and the score by Alexandre Desplat is one of the highlights, fun and full of energy.I'd still encourage you to watch Secret Life of Pets 2, especially if you want some light-hearted fun or are looking for a clean family movie. But if you're looking for a high-quality film or deeper message, you can look elsewhere. These dogs haven't learned any new tricks: 2.5 out of 5 stars.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
193,geraldmcginty-51583,"Boring, Lame, Childish",1,2 November 2019,"Do not waste your precious time, It repeated the same thing over and over. I only finished watching it because I was having a family night and I hate toy story 4, so did it for my folks. This movie has no meaning, no plot. The movie started, with Max and Duke, watching their owner get married. And with that, eventually a baby came about. Max, and Duke disliked the baby, (I assume because it was new. The baby was in their territory which made them uncomfortable). A few minutes later, it ALL turned around, the baby started to look up to them. It copied, rubbed against them; which Max found a grow on the baby from it as well as calmness). They eventually become the best of friends. That basically ended the whole baby thing, the rest of it was filled with the baby, copying the dogs, their movements etc. That, and Max saying he was going to protect him. (Spoiler alert: he never did, he didn't have the guts or even the will). Then the baby just totally disappeared from the scene out of nowhere, and for most of the movie too; except for Max to say he was going to be his protector. The story played out; with the boys going to a farm for vacation. Max giving his special toy to Gidget. (This was the dog who had a crush on Max, but the feelings weren't mutual). When Max went over and asked her, she answered with a bright
""yes!"" All bubbly, spirited expressing ""I'll guard it with my life!"" Her facial expression were a little off here. And she had all this chemistry toward Max, as well as cheekiness, and you could tell she REALLY wanted to protect that toy for HIM. She ended up making a BIG fuss over protecting it. It was all very dramatic for me. Also, you could tell there was some flirtatiousness going ON, on her side, of the dime. But Max, on the other side, just didn't respond. (Which that is okay!) But what wasn't was, for the whole scene he was just being serious (not assuming her feelings at all). (Which is totally fine). (But how the scene played out... I was thinking how Max obviously doesn't like her, and that made me mad, only because, on the side of my head, I was thinking ""oh this was the storyline last time""... ""oh I thought they were getting further by the end of the movie (Secret Life Of Pets 1) with that scene"".... ""Max doesn't even notice"".... ""they are just pretending"".... This felt unfair. What also was very bothersome to me was Max, he handled everything in a very serious way, it wasn't just portrayed that he didn't like her, but it was portrayed in a way, where chemistry was lacked so much so, to put a solid close to that scene meaning. You know when you make a movie, even if you witness polar opposite things the writers and directors usually make it so the other character supports it. Or at least so it doesn't clash with the other's feelings. This movie did none of that. It just clashed. But the whole chemistry of the scene, wasn't good. A movie should make the feelings of the two starring individuals (even if at polar opposites view points), the underline of it should be smooth and not completely destroy the other. It wasn't a good scene.Then the scene ended, Max left, to go to the farm, and now what happened after that? I didn't even know what was happening, everything was random. It was very scattered, completely! Honestly, the rest of the movie went like... -Gidget trying to protect that toy. Where in that, no action happened, she dumbly dropped the toy, and had to face evil cats to get it back, which later they become her friends/admirers : WHAT?).--- Max, and Duke, got to know the vacation spot by running around; the baby appearing every so often smiling, and mocking the dogs (so immature).-- There was this evil man, that continuously took dogs and abused them, he was a part of the circus per say. Around, the farmlands a 'tough' dog appearing, Max feeling threatened, he even felt the need to challenge him. Snowball playing superhero, meeting Daisy (a feisty, but righteous type of dog). She wanted to save her friend Hu. (which Hu was probably the most adorable loin I have ever seen, so innocent, so pure, sweet..) Snowball acting all tough then volunteering to go venture with Daisy to save poor Tu. (Which by the way which he wasn't, he was just a creature pretending to be a superhero; which honestly throughout the story how how.. did he get there? What I remember from the last movie, was that he was evil, the baddest of the bad. This movie started off with him being in a little girl's house, the girl was sweet, and that's not the problem. But I just I do not understand; if he was the baddest of the bad BEFORE, saying he'd be killing humans, and HATES them all, how could a little girl even a sweet one reform him? I mean, don't evil people usually find the deepest repulsion in the sweetest of the sweet? And now he pretends he's a superhero when he can't even lift a weight. Who is he kidding? This whole thing is twisted). They did end up getting him out (Daisy*). (I felt bad for Tu). Then they had to find Tu (the lion) a home. (Which this took about 30 minutes to find). I felt bad for the guy honestly again*. As the plot so called brewed in (it's own* way), the evil man captured Tu and he 'got' known. Then the showdown I guess was... Max, Duke, Daisy, Snowball, all the main characters of this movie, trying to save Tu. Max was still terrified of everything!!! ......I got to say though the 'tough' dog, helped Max, be brave, which I thought that was very knowledgeable for kids, and adults alike. But unfortunately Max although he tried, he did not overcome and he remained a coward (sorry*). Then they saved Tu :), and the bad man got payback for his crimes with a car running him over twice, Daisy hitting him purposefully! (Me: I was kind've hoping he'd get arrested. The part I was VERY offended with, in this whole movie was that he was taking innocent animals, locking them in a cage/scaring him/making them FEAR him/abusing him. This is NOT okay. This honestly infuriated me, and caused me great pain even, it was just horrible to me. After they saved Tu, the movie was done. (And I was like ""what the heck was that?"" (referring to the movie) Then credits came on!! ????My thoughts for this
They were no funny parts, or comedy even the parts they attempted to be funny
There was no logical in it, no fun, just sorry to be mean but stupidity
It's just boring, no excitement, whatsoever
It was very childish, but not in a enchanting, fun, lively way. In a literal, childISH way, nonetheless a childish way that had no GOOD meaning for children, who are trying to explore life for themselves. It didn't fit the heart of what children are looking for.
(I strongly advise you not to see this movie.)Things to make the movie better and smooth.Story-line: At the start of the movie, the baby Liam was born, Max and Duke's first reaction was dislike. The baby was new and in 'there' space. It was invasive. And In the later parts of the movie, random pieces extended throughout the movie as a whole. Max kept saying he was going to protect Liam. But as the movie progressed it got more and more apparent, that he couldn't step up, It was obvious he wasn't brave enough from soon on and they didn't develop it in anyway.
My version, the better version: A good idea would have been making the story into how they would deal with the baby (with this ultimate dislike for the baby). The baby enormously in their space, the baby 'took' over, and the adventures they had to go on with the baby reluctly, when the parents were at work. It would have worked, at least more smoothly than the original story plot whatever. Because, even in this film the parents were barely there to begin with, in fact it was like they were in a whole another time era. So, this would have worked out a least a bit better, nevertheless definitely with THIS solid plot line, more smoothly.
(Idea 2:)
Story line: Max wanted to protect Leim (the baby). In actuality, despite wanting to protect this baby, as the movie went by, Max repeatedly said the same thing over and over, ""I must protect him!""; Meanwhile, as the movie progressed (which it barely did) Max ended up not doing anything to help Leim. (Except if you want to count Leim looking up to both Max and Duke. Wait, now that I think about that, that may have stemmed the plot line in the first place; Max feeling acknowledged by the baby looking up to them, feeling so pleased by the fact, he wanted to show the baby how graceful he could be). Maybe?) But unfortunately Max ended up not lifting a paw for Liam, nevertheless he wouldn't of being able to protect him if necessary.Perhaps a better idea for this story-line: They could have made this whole plot line into a movie. The two dogs, getting to know the baby. And with that, gaining a more loving bond. Then something coming up and Max actually stepping up, saving the day and being brave or just doing anything more.This would have taught kids to be brave. But instead; I know I might be toting my own horn. But this movie was boring, lifeless, non-comedic, non-adventurous, no true action. Nothing was funny, there was no plot NO STORY.Comments to the movie----
I do not think it's a good idea to be teaching kids to mock a dogs movements. It also isn't good for them to see a BABY do it. Because in real life, babies need to grow up as humans and have human role models, not for a dog to be there role model. What I mean by this, is they should want to copy their mom and father's mannerisms. I am not saying that they can't love there dog. But they should at least be looking up to a parent because they are suppose be learning human mannerisms. As they grow, they need to understand 'humans'. I disliked this part, this whole thing became an idea in my mind. ??? A baby, that mocks a dog's mannerisms, that's JUST insulting, when a baby comes out, they should be experiencing life, this is something in the movie I thought to be childish, at the core of bad influence.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

202,rajatbasak,Same entertaining just like the first one.,8,22 August 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. Nice story and dialogues. Full of adventures, animations was top notch, characters were very cute and adorable. Far better than the trailer.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
203,brightbrumby,A fun little flick!,7,4 July 2019,"I enjoyed seeing this film on a Thursday while going around the shopping centre on my own. I am a young adult and I don't have any kids so I'm not the target audience for this film. Anyway, I still wanted to see this movie as I was a fan of the first one and my passion lies in children's entertainment, and it looked decent enough from the trailers.
There were some very good aspects to this film, such as the way Rooster (Harrison Ford's first voice role) shows Max how to be brave when he so is over-protective towards Katie's new son Liam, and I thought it was great how there was a subplot that tried to raise awareness of cruelty to circus animals, and it is something children's films don't usually do.
Another part of the film is focusing on Gidget, with Cleo's help, attempting to retrieve Max's ""busy bee"" toy from an old cat lady's apartment in order to impress him. I found this to be quite silly and unoriginal, but still funny. The old lady, the cats and Gidget end up rescuing the rest of the gang in the end, and I don't think they ever actually did solve the whole busy bee situation, now that I think about it.
I liked the two new main characters, Rooster and Daisy, and Snowball is as obnoxious as he is in the first film, but at least he is a good guy now. His ending scene when his girl puts him in a princess dress and he raps to her new stuffed panda toy was silly and a little cringe-worthy, but the kids in the cinema still seemed to find it very funny. But I did really like the ending from Max's point of view, when Liam starts preschool and Max says that he will help him get through it and he will always be there, but he is still confident because he understands that Liam is ready for this time and he will grow up eventually.
If I needed to say something negative overall about the movie, it would be that it's over-the-top silly and unoriginal at times, but you shouldn't be too surprised because the first one was like that as well. It's clear to see that it does need to rely on lame toilet jokes at times. Some other things I feel I would need to cover is that there were a few plot holes that annoyed me a little bit at the start. Max, Duke and all the other pets didn't seem to age at all after the first film, despite the fact that Max and Duke's owner, Katie, has met a guy, dated him for maybe a year or two, got married, got pregnant, and now their son is a year or two old. This would mean that three years at the very least would have passed since the events of the first film, and I'm sure you would know that a domesticated dog's lifespan is far shorter than that of a human's, I mean, come on! Pops the Basset Hound was too elderly in the first movie to have survived another three years, let alone be as active as he was! But I guess I'm pushing it a little bit as that is quite a minor flaw and this is a kid's movie and the makers probably just kept it this way because of plot convenience and that sort of stuff.
I guess the important thing is that the kids in the cinema were very entertained and I didn't even hear many adults talking, either. I was mostly entertained by it, too. But this is definitely more designed to entertain kids, not necessarily families, I feel. It is great fun and a good laugh, and it was a decent way to kill a couple of hours, but to be completely honest, if you had to see just one, you're much better off taking the family to see Toy Story 4. But, if you can, the Secret Life of Pets 2 is still worth taking your kids to see.

209,kglovesdogs,A fun sequel,7,30 March 2021,"The Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019) is a 3D animated family comedy. Max, a terrier, and his brother, Duke, go on a family vacation to their owner's countryside farm. Rooster, the farm's sheepdog, teaches Max courage which later helps him to be less afraid of letting Liam, his owner's baby, explore and adventure in the city. While Max and Duke are on the farm, Max entrusts his favorite toy, Busy Bee, with his friend Gidget. Gidget falls asleep while dreaming of Max and accidentally loses Busy Bee to a cat lady's apartment. She learns how to act like a cat so she can get back Max's favorite toy. Meanwhile, Snowball, a pet bunny, assists a Shih Tzu named Daisy in rescuing Hu, an abused circus tiger. Max and Snowball fight together to defeat the wolves on a locomotive, and the crazy cat lady along with some of the other pets knock out Sergei, the circus wizard, before he can shoot Max and Snowball.The expert choice of colors in this animated film made it very enjoyable to watch. For example, when the characters arrive on the farm, all the colors of the rainbow are used and display the playfulness and adventure awaiting Duke and Max. At night at the circus, the colors turn darker and duller which foreshadow the trouble that Snowball and Daisy await. The casting of the character's voices was also very well done. Max's tenor voice personified his timidity throughout the film. Gidget's high and playful voice highlighted her upbeat and ""girly-girl"" personality which contrasted with her mission to enter the dark lair of the cats.Overall, I would rate this movie a 7/10. I liked how there were three different story lines that all merged at the end of the film. This was a positive and enjoyable movie that actually made me laugh a few times. One of my favorite parts was Captain Snowball's comic or when Chloe got high off of catnip. The reason why I give the film a 7/10 and not higher is because, though it is a children's movie, the plot is very predictable and doesn't have many twists or turns that I wasn't expecting.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

The part that really brought this movie down for me was the hot mess that was the plot/story line. It felt like the original intent of this franchise was to create a tv show.

247,nicolevannicola,Parents beware!- starts good but VERY DISAPPOINTING,2,29 August 2019,"The majority of this movie was nice. I really enjoyed the idea of trying to help someone overcome their fears. That part of the movie was good, with a lot of kid-style humor & amusement. But the part that ruins it for me is near the end (no spoiler here) where the old dog says, loud & clear as day, ""Pickles is pissed!""
There is NO good reason that kind of word should EVER be in a children's movie!! Everyone knows kids repeat what they hear & the last thing I wanna here coming out of my 3 year old's mouth as she walks into school (or anytime!) is ""Pickles is pissed!"" The alliteration makes it even more ""fun"" to say, & I am beyond disappointed and incredibly angry at the poor choice in using this word. All cuss words show is a true lack of creativity. Truly disappointing to ruin what was a perfectly cute & fine movie without it. This movie & any others by them will not be coming into our home again as we now know we cannot trust them.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
248,debdetroit,Cat portrayal,2,19 August 2019,"Why is every cat in this movie portrayed as sinister and mean?? Considering there are millions of cat lovers out there, as well as dog lovers, this is upsetting. Your're teaching children that cats are scary and untrustworthy. It's completely irresponsible. Sure, cats (AND dogs) can be these things, but more often than not cats are adorable, sweet, playful, and loving (even if they don't lick your face or sit in your lap-although some do :) Cat's have their own set of lovable qualities that differ from dogs. So to generalize cat behavior as negative sends a very sad and ignorant message.
In addition, Why is the female owner thin and the man overweight (or so large)? Other humans shown also follow these shapes. So children learn ""women should be skinny"" but it's okay for men not to be.
Fun story line, but so disappointing. If you dare to enter ""The Secret Life of Pets 2"", be ready for a ride back to 1950's style families.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

253,dddblackbeard,Hilarious and enthralling,10,11 June 2019,"Being rather disappointed by the first part of this cartoon, I did find the second part absolutely fascinating.To begin with, there are some serious issues being brought up, such as taking risks or playing safe in the context of upbringing. Should children climb trees to be learnt from their own experience or should we keep them safe from any conceivable risks?Moreover, not only gags occur throughout the storyline, but some puns or psychological kind of humour as well. And some hilarious characters, such as this crazy cat-lover granny, are not to be neglected. I did burst out laughing with this scene in the vet hall as well with all these ""psycho"" pets and their utterances.Little did I guess about the plot development! Ok, I might have foreseen some obvious twists (I cannot tell them here so as to avoid spoilers), but others came rather unexpected, which was something I liked the most. Being bored by all this predictability in movies and cartoons, I could be really amused at last!And the last but not the least is about the soundtrack which I think fits the cartoon like a glove. It was so pleasant to hear long-forgotten melodies once again in a brand-new context.I do hope this story will be continued and that it would be done so in an increasingly good fashion. By that I entail that it would not be cursed with such a bane that struck the ""Fantastic Beasts 2"" or the ""Maze runner 3"". I distinctly remember how disappointed I felt at the time I was watching those ones and regretting what on earth had happened to my favourite characters!To sum up, I do recommend going to the cinema and disconnecting for an hour and a half or so with this undoubtedly great cartoon.",The Secret Life of Pets 2
254,Hyraeth,"Fun, Hilarious, and Exciting",8,13 June 2019,"The Secret Life of Pets 2 is an exciting movie, to say the least. You don't have to watch the first movie to understand this one. It's clearly targeted toward younger kids, although this one is arguably darker (and better, I think!) than its prequel, with glimpses of guns, throwing knives, and animal abuse. The Secret Life of Pets 2 revolves around the likeable doggo Max, and an assortment of his animal friends, after the end of the first movie. Max entrusts his favorite toy, Busy Bee, to his friend, Gidget, while he and Duke go on a trip to a farm. However, Gidget quickly loses the toy in a cat-infested apartment, and to win it back, she must learn how to act like a cat. Meanwhile, Snowball, the ""bad guy"" from the prequel, embarks on a crime-fighting career with a newcomer, a dog called Daisy. They rescue a white tiger named Hu from an abusive circus show, but the circus owner won't just let go of Hu without a fight.The Secret Life of Pets 2 is definitely more confusing than the first movie, with these three different, unrelated plots occurring at once, but in the end coming together, in a similar style to the first movie. Some of these plots are completely pointless, but it's still amusing and fun to watch. However, this won't make it any less enjoyable. The humor is still present, despite the darker theme, and the jokes are worth laughter. The characters are also more interesting than what someone would expect from a ""kiddy"" movie, and many teach valuable life lessons. For example, while on the farm, Max learns that one doesn't have to be big, strong, or intimidating to be brave. Many of the other characters are completely pointless, though. Gidget's plot was unnecessary, and the rest of the main characters in the prequel did nothing; this movie only gave Max, Snowball, and Daisy interesting roles to play, in my opinion.Despite the movie being pretty ""childish"", there were several intense and entertaining action scenes, such as the scene where Max is forced to rescue a lamb from a cliff, and the fight on the train at the end. The Secret Life of Pets 2 has a kind of predictable plot, however. Since this is a kid-targeted movie and all of the cute, fluffy characters are protected by plot armor, the moviegoer knows that they'll win no matter what happens (although this is definitely a characteristic of most movies, so you can interpret this as nitpicking) - even Gidget, Chloe, and their friends crashing a car into the villain at the end of the movie is predictable. It's also a pretty realistic representation of pets (not the parts where they jump onto trains and fight evil wolves); the movie references things like a dog's instinct to chase after a ball, and a cat attempting to catch the red laser dot. The animation is very smooth and the characters are adorable.Overall, this is a fun and heartwarming story, slightly darker than the first one (if you don't want your kid to see guns and throwing knives for whatever reason), but still very appropriate for younger children, teens, and even adults who need some time off. A big chunk of the story is completely pointless, but this is a movie aimed at children, and it's still fun, hilarious, and enjoyable to watch. 7.9/10.",The Secret Life of Pets 2

However Illumination and Universal pictures have determined how I rate this movie. So yes due to Illumination and Universal not allowing Louis C.K. to continue with the voice of Max, this movie is terrible.

The first movie was mostly great in a lot of ways, and I feel like the movie was fine being a one time thing. It felt full and concluded.Even so, we have a sequel that isn't nearly as good as the first. With it's bland humor and trouble to keep a story line, The Secret Life of Pets 2 falls behind.Max is trying to handle his owner having a child, and going on a trip to a farm. Gidget has to watch Max's ""busy bee"" toy. Snowball and Daisy, a new character, try to rescue a tiger named Hu from the circus. In the end, the plot with Max and Gidget are forgotten. They served no purpose to the film - they were nearly irrelevant.The way these plots were shown, too, was awful. They basically split them all up.This is not a completely horrible movie, though - the kids will love it, and it's a good family experience.

We also loved it because of the positivity-all animals end up being good guys and the only kind-of-dark part was when the viper got smashed. SLP 2 on the other hand is full of dark and heavy (for a 3 yo): a cruel antagonist who beats animals, creepy cats at an animal psychiatrist (?) who say they start fires, and the said antagonist getting run over by a car several times. I was so disappointed that this was the first movie we let out boy see in the theaters. I wish they had made a movie more like the original and stayed focused on positive themes.

271,asenchak,A review from a CHILDS perspective,9,26 May 2020,"I've read quite a bit of the reviews and they're all from an adult view. Now I don't normally bother with writing reviews because it's all individual opinion. With that being said, I LOVED the first one, and so did my eldest daughter and son. This one, my youngest a toddler, in which this movie is aimed at (CHILDREN) can literally sit and watch this all day long. Now for a toddler to be able to sit for over an hour and watch a movie is almost unheard of. Toddlers are always moving and going. Pets 2 is on my tv whenever we're home, and my not even 2 year old will SIT AND WATCH the whole thing! Now I'm a fan of the first one, and if I can sit and watch the second literally on repeat, it's a good movie.
Now, I'm a little disappointed with what they did with Max. In the first he was brave, courageous and ready for adventure. This one, they made him afraid of everything until Rooster takes him under his wing if you will. I didn't like that. I also didn't like that Hu didn't talk...I'm just curious as to why they chose to keep him non verbal.
Anyway, I wrote this review because of all the harsh unnecessary ADULT criticism. The movie was good. It keeps my toddler entertained and doesn't get on my nerves after watching it for the thousandth time. There's hardly ever a sequel that's ever better than the first, but this movie is a good movie!

I love animated movies, and I usually give them a try even if I have no interest in them. However, my gut feeling was telling me to skip this one, but since my little brother wanted to watch it, I figure I'd give it a try. Though my gut feeling was right, my little brother did end up enjoying the film.I wouldn't say this is a family film, since I believe most parents will be bored out of their mind. It's a kids film, and a decent one at that. The film feels like episodes from Saturday morning cartoons put into one, so there's not much of a plot here. The Max's storyline had the most potential but ended up being the weakest and boring.The character I wished had her own storyline was Chloe (the fat cat). I ended up chuckling during most of her scenes. Unfortunately Chloe is in few scenes. Snowball had some funny moments but at times was annoying.Again this is a film for kids, not a family film.
