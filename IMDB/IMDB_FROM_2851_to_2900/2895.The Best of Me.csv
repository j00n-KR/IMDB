0,SnoopyStyle,Cut out the last 20 minutes,4,13 June 2015,"Dawson Cole (James Marsden) is an offshore oil rig worker who almost dies. Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) is married with a young son. They both receive a call about the death of their friend Tuck Hostetler (Gerald McRaney) and they are to attend the reading of his will. Back in 1992, Dawson (Luke Bracey) and Amanda Collier (Liana Liberato) from different backgrounds meet.Uh! Oh! It's another Nicholas Sparks movie. What kind of gimmick is this one going to throw at us? I don't want to dismiss this out of hand. I like both Marsden and Monaghan. I'm certainly willing to give them a chance but they're only half of the equation. Their younger versions are played by Liberato and Bracey. Liberato is a fine young actress. I know very little about the new Australian flavor of the week Bracey. His character doesn't allow him much other than be a rugged pretty boy. The family dysfunction could have given him some juicy ideas to play with but he does very little with it. Maybe he's told not to act too much so that he could match Marsden. His best acting is taking off his shirt and positioning just so to hide Liana's boobs. Let's just say I'm not impressed.This is not a great movie but it could have still finished as good enough. I hoped against all hope that it doesn't put in the usual Sparks twist. At around 90 minutes, Amanda goes home to her uncaring husband. If it ended there, this would have been a fine sad, poignant, slightly-European romance. It's the perfect place to end but my wish does not come true. The last 20 minutes are predictable, clunky and annoying. I almost fast forwarded to the end but instead I just did a bit of surfing the net while the movie gets to its inevitable conclusion.",The Best of Me
1,Prismark10,The worse is yet to come,2,30 December 2015,"Nicolas Sparks novels have some devout fans but I doubt even the most ardent ones would say this is a successful translation of the story.Dawson Cole (James Marsden) is an offshore oil rig worker. Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) is unhappily married with a young son. In 1992 when both were teenagers from different sides of the social divide both became star crossed lovers. At the time young Dawson who was estranged from his backwoods drug dealing family was kind of adopted by Tuck (Gerald McRaney.) A tragic incident tore the young couple apart. Now 21 years later, Tuck's death means they come together for his funeral and both discover that they still carry a torch for one another.Like The Notebook there are parallel stories in two time streams. Confusion will arise because the younger actors look nothing like the older versions. It is like watching a different film. To yearn for the days when a film such as A League of Their Own went out of its way to cast actors that looked like their younger counterparts.The other confusing aspects is that 1992 in this film seems to look much like 1962. It is like that the film-makers wanted to evoke some other time period or maybe this small town was definitely stuck behind the times with old cars just like Cuba.The film wants to be a slushy romance between two people destined to be with each other. In the intervening two decades they have had problems moving on from their feeling for each other which actually sounds a little creepy.Of course ghosts of the past drum up conflict and as the film neared the end even my wife piped up by saying this would be a really lame film if x,y & z happened as a twist.Well what more could be said than the uninspired and lazy does take place. Sometimes a film deserves the label. Lame.",The Best of Me
2,kosmasp,"Some of me, sometime",5,2 September 2015,"Without spoiling anything, I am glad they went with the ending they chose. There's the alternate ending on the disc and it just feels wrong. Actually or more accurately unfortunately, the disc asks you which version you want to watch, which kinda is a spoiler itself. Choose your ending kind of thing.The acting is OK, though as with most romantic comedies/dramas, you can see where this is going. Only thing you're wondering, is why the obvious is not being said. But the two main actors do a solid good job even with some not so well written dialog (plenty of clichés and more for you to relish or be afraid of). At the end of the day, it'll depend on your mood and openness to a movie like this ...",The Best of Me
3,tavm,The Best of Me was a pretty enjoyable Nicholas Sparks movie,7,26 October 2014,"So my movie theatre-working friend was getting off from work in the afternoon today and he wanted to see another movie before going to his sister's house to watch the New Orleans-Green Bay football game there. So this was what we ended up seeing. I once again decided to humor him and to tell the truth, this was quite enjoyable despite some familiar clichés like bad boy-liking-good girl-who-he-has-to-break up-with-because-of-his-roots (well, there was more than that but you get the idea). The fact this was filmed and takes place in our home state of Louisiana was a plus for me and my friend as we recognized some town names being mentioned and certain car window stickers in the film. Yes, it's based on a Nicholas Sparks book and it has what you'd possibly expect from him. Still, by the time it all ended, we were both touched by what happened. So on that note, The Best of Me is worth a look.",The Best of Me
4,oscaralbert,Talk about having your cake and eating it too . . .,7,20 October 2014,". . . THE BEST OF ME is every wive's dream, as long as you overlook Amanda's pact with the Devil, her crass hypocrisy regarding alcohol, and this flick's dark incest themes. A geezer named Tuck Not-Quite-So-Everlasting (a blatant stand-in for Beezlebub) pops back into the lives of his favorite two high school troublemakers after 21 years in the form of a box of ashes, which issues marching orders to the married mom and the conscience-plagued best-friend-killer to spread these mortal remains at his joint bequeath to them--a Garden of Eden-like love nest far from the Real World. Since THE BEST OF ME folks hired Hollywood's top product placement team, the reunited couple's week-long love tryst is fueled by Budweiser--carefully positioned in the foreground of nearly every frame. This despite the fact that Amanda's marriage has been dissolved by Demon Rum (check out Hogarth's Gin and Ale contrasting woodcuts, if you have a fine arts background). Then, in a climax that defines Bathos, Mr. I-send-every-dime-I-make to-my-best-friend's-fatherless-boy (except-what-I-need-to-keep my-late-model-Corvette-convertible-running) finds out WHY he was saved from certain death for a Week in Paradise: sure enough, Amanda's only surviving child needs his heart, which Daddy missed by an inch with his rifle blast! Now Mommy's Man can never stray from Sonny's chest!",The Best of Me
5,neil-476,Too obvious to be wholly successful,7,20 October 2014,"Dawson has an accident while being heroic which should have killed him twice over. While ruminating on whether there is a reason for his survival, he is notified of the death of Tuck who was a father figure to him (Dawson came from a ne'er-do-well family, and Tuck took him in and encouraged him to make something of himself. While at Tuck's for the funeral, he meets Amanda, the rich girl who was his first love (and he hers): despite 20 years having gone by, they discover that they both still love each other. But Amanda is married with a family. The present day story unfolds in parallel with the story of 20 years ago and why and how they parted.This romantic drama has its moments despite being somewhat hampered by clodhopping obviousness in its plotting – there are frequent moments when something happens which leads you to assume that, as a result, XYZ will be following in fairly short order, and so it does. This is at its worst towards the end when Amanda's son injures a heart valve in an accident and needs a heart transplant, following which we are served up with a reminder (like we needed it) that Dawson must have survived his accident for a reason. I bet I can guess what that reason is, right? The performances are mostly fine, albeit Dawson's white trash family are somewhat over the top. James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as the late 30s Dawson and Amanda are very good, as are Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato as their teenage versions. Unfortunately, the teenagers don't look very much like their older versions – Bracey looks like Heath Ledger, and Liberato has a different sort of prettiness to Monaghan (she also overdoes the vibrato in her voice during moments of high emotion).There were some genuinely moving moments in this: there were also too many moments when I was aware of being mechanically manipulated by moving the story where the author wanted it to go, not where it felt it would go naturally.",The Best of Me
6,phd_travel,Not the best of Nicholas Sparks,2,21 January 2015,"Fans of adaptations of Nicholas Sparks romantic novels will get some familiar things, a lush Southern setting, an American Song Book tune, some making out over several time periods. Unfortunately those expecting something in the line of The Notebook will be disappointed, because the passionate romance and right casting are not here.Firstly the casting was bad. The actors playing the younger and older versions of the male lead Dawson weren't well matched. The younger actor Luke Bracey acts passioinately but looks too old to play a teenager, his relationship with the girl played by Liana Liberato looked predatory. Equally wrong is that his face is too unlike James Marsden's to be his younger self. Unfortunately the late Paul Walker was originally cast and the pairing would have been better. As far as the female lead, Michelle Monaghan plays Amanda and she physically matches the younger actress more but her character is unsympathetic seeming a bit self absorbed and self pitying. Her acting when her son was injured was strangely emotionless.The story is a feel bad passionless tale full of clichés that do more harm than good. There are just too many clichés thrown together. The rich girl poor boy with disapproving father is just done to death. The death at the end makes the whole tale seem pointless. As if a father will shoot his son like that. The heart transplant thing doesn't ring true. The affair wasn't really justified. It leave you with a feel bad taste at the end. Gerald McRaney is quite good as the man who brings them together although his motivation doesn't seem right and it kind of caused Dawson to get killed.Skip this one, maybe the next one ""The Longest Ride"" will be better.",The Best of Me
7,A_Different_Drummer,Two movies for the price of one,5,8 February 2015,"... which may not necessarily be a good thing.Oddly, you divide the two almost at the midway point, that is, the one hour mark.The first movie is a really sweet love story about lost love. It features a lot of flashbacks but luckily the actors playing the flashbacks and the actors playing 'real time' are all very competent, do a great job,the script works well, and the audience has a fun ride.If the first hour were a movie on its own, I would give it a very strong rating.However almost at the turn of the second hour (two hours BTW is much too long for this story) the connection between audience and viewer (this important factor discussed in many of my IMDb reviews) starts to fade as many story complications set in. And the script becomes lost in the various arcs.I will not go into the complications but let me say that by the ""climax"" of the last Act the viewer may wonder if he/she dozed off and woke up in front of the TV watching an episode of JUSTIFIED. Enough said.If the second hour were a movie on its own, I would give it a very low rating.As an entire movie as it now stands, this film can be a rough ride for the viewer, and that is not a good thing.Notes: * always happy to see Michelle Monaghan, an actress under-used these days. Real star quality.* Liana Liberato has a nice career ahead and better still actually looks like a young Michelle Monaghan, which is more than I can say of the casting choices for the male leads * here is a tip for casting directors. FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. Help you avoid the problem of casting two actors playing the same role (one in flashback) WHO LOOK NOTHING AT ALL LIKE EACH OTHER",The Best of Me
8,inkblot11,"Best get your tissues ready for any showing, very sad but lovely story, beautiful scenery, too",8,29 October 2014,"Dawson Cole (James Marsden, older and Luke Bracey, younger) works on an offshore oil rig. His performance as a rough neck is well respected. Unhappily, the rig catches fire one day and blows, but Dawson manages to rescue two men before he plunges over 100 feet into the ocean. Miraculously, he is alive, perhaps saved by a vision of a girl he knew long ago. That would be Amanda (Michelle Monaghan, older, Liana Liberato, younger). Shortly after, Dawson goes back home, having received notice that a dear surrogate father, Tuck (Gerald McRaney) has died. Amanda is there, too. At once, the film goes back to their senior-in-high-school days. Amanda was the pretty little rich girl. Unluckily, Dawson was the son of an abusive backwoods drug dealer. They met by accident, where Dawson was too stymied even to talk to this gal. But, slowly, a relationship developed. After another beating, Dawson ran away from home and stayed with the crusty widower Tuck, which enabled him to see more of Amanda. Love was strong and true between them. Yet, her dad disapproved and a crisis tore them apart. Now, 20 years later, they meet. Alas, Amanda is married with a husband, teen son, and memories of a daughter who died. But, will these two be able to resist the immense feelings of love that come rushing back? This beautiful movie should have romance fans crying oceans and sighing deeply. Forget the critics, they absolutely DO NOT KNOW HOW to review a female oriented movie any more. The cast is wonderful, the Louisiana setting is gorgeous, the costumes lovely, the script touching and the direction slow but analytic. Yes, this viewer didn't care for the ending, in which an added element was not needed to enhance the strength of the tale. But, all in all, fans best carry along a couple boxes of tissues, as this heartfelt flick will have tears falling like rain for all.",The Best of Me
9,851222,Nice looking but shallow and predictable flick with some bad casting choises,7,25 January 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Best of Me"" (2014) is a romantic drama from the mind of Nicolas Sparks, the man who created ""Notebook"" and many more romantic flicks. This flick isn't original, special or great - it looks nice, cinematography is good, but it's very predictable, cheesy and shallow. Acing was OK but nothing special, and thats not a good sign as this kind of movie must have great chemistry between actors, and there was no chemistry between the young versions of main characters. And by the way, Luke Bracey and James Marsden has got absolutely no physical resemblance - and they are playing the same character and i think that both ladies are also doesn't look similar at all - and they have no chemistry - it's just bad casting. Overall, ""The Best of Me"" isn't bad movie, it's just that it's highly familiar, predictable and sometimes manipulative. I could easily bashed this movie and find ""100 clichés"" but i'm giving it 7 because at running time of almost 2 hours i wasn't bored.",The Best of Me
10,Reno-Rangan,A failed high school romance and one more chance to fix it in the later years.,6,24 November 2016,"Based on one of the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name. The story of a failed high school romance who meet again later in their lives. But the flashback comes right away after the initial segment to reveal theirs young romance and what made them part away. Between the present and the past, it keeps up the momentum and concludes the tale with a twist. Though you would know mile away what's coming.I did not like all the films based on the stories from the original author. But this one looked okay to me, not so good or too bad. All his films are romance theme, but in this film, that part was very weak. I did not expect that, particularly emotionless when compared to his other flicks. Still, the filmmaking was decent, with the good actors. But the casting was confusing at the beginning for having two sets of actors and then soon it cleared out all the doubts.Kind of supernatural theme, but not a fantasy. Feels a bit long, because the story developments were slow and most of the parts are not interesting. This is not a romance film I was looking for, but different where everything was dragged to the final twist, especially since the accident that happened at the opening. I did not watch it till now, because I did not feel I wanted to after watching its trailer. But I knew some day I would see it and that is now. I don't know what you thought of it, but for me it is an average film.6/10",The Best of Me
11,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,25 May 2021,"""The Best of Me"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a former high school pair returning to their small hometown after many years. There they talk about their lives, their choices and their former dreams while they remember their old love story.I believe that ""The Best of Me"" followed the same pattern as many other romantic movies and did not succeed to surprise or to add something new. It was predictable and even when there was a try of creating a plot twist, the way it was presented it was not the best. The direction which was made by Michael Hoffman, it was average and predictable something that made it boring. The way he presented the story and the lives of his main characters was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential. The interpretations of both Michelle Monaghan who played as Amanda and James Marsden who played as Dawson were good and along with the other two interpretations of Liana Liberato who played as Young Amanda and Luke Bracey who played as Young Dawson made the movie a little bit better. Finally, I have to say that ""The Best of Me"" is an average romantic movie that if you have high expectations you will be disappointed, if you have not any expectations and you want to spend your time then you should watch it.",The Best of Me
12,zkonedog,Paint-By-Numbers Romantic Drama,3,27 February 2017,"As a 29-year old male, ""The Best Of Me"" was not a movie I would typically watch. But, it just happened to be ""let someone else pick the movie for a change"" night and so I gave it a try. While it isn't an outright horrible flick, it was exactly what I expected...and that's not why I watched movies.For a basic plot summary, ""Best of Me"" tells the story of Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) & Dawson (James Marsden), two 30-something adults brought back to their mutual hometown by the death of a friend. As they get re-acquainted, their romantic backstory is shown via flashbacks, with Young Amanda (Liano Liberato) and Young Dawson (Luke Bracey) navigating the trials of young love. Back in the present, the two must reconcile the lives that were with the lives that are.The trouble with this movie is that it is exactly as predictable and sappy as one would think...nothing more, nothing less. If you are a sucker for these types of movies and like to know what to expect when going in, than you will probably love this type of film-making. However, if you want a few genuine surprises and relationships that don't feel like they are being heavy manipulated to stimulate tears and tug on the heartstrings, than you should probably stay away.An interesting thought when it comes to Nicholas Sparks book-to-film translations: I don't have any ""hard numbers"" to back me up on this, of course, but I think it is a pretty safe bet that ""The Notebook"" has best the most well-received. I know young and old (and many in between) who have thoroughly enjoyed that flick. The reason? It was first. Everything after that has kind of been a different variation on the same theme: sappy romance with large doses of tragedy. I wonder if perhaps the novelty is wearing a bit thin with films like this one.That being said, it seems like there are easily enough people who like this formula and will continue to populate theaters for it. If you are able to take everything strictly at face value and not think too much, I can see how it would be very possible to get swept away in the dramatic experience. Nothing wrong with that...but not my cup of tea by a mile.",The Best of Me
13,leonblackwood,Emotional love story! 6/10,6,14 February 2015,"Review: We have all seen this type of love story before, we're a couple of teenagers fall in love and then a incident makes them separate for ages and then they end up getting back together after many years of being apart. That's the basic concept of this movie and you can't help but feel for the couple who go through many obstacles throughout the years. The film goes back and forth in time and shows how the two high-school sweethearts, who come from 2 completely different backgrounds, fall in love and get separated by an unfortunate incident. When they finally meet back up, due to the death of the couples close friend, it shows that they still truly love each other and that there love is worth fighting for. I know that it sounds corny, but I actually enjoyed the film because the actors put in realistic performances, especially the Heath Ledger lookalike who had some emotional scenes involving his abusive father. I thought that it was going to be predictable, but there journey really does go down some troubling avenues which made the movie enjoyable. I'm not usually a fan of films in this genre but it was a decent watch, especially as I watched it on Valentines Day. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I don't know how to take James Marsden as an actor because he has played some silly roles, like in Enchanted and Anchorman 2 but he has also starred in some serious movies like the Butler and this movie, which didn't have a touch of comedy at all. He has also starred in the X-Men franchise and Superman Returns so he has a wide range and he usually puts in good performances. Michelle Monaghan, who looked pretty sexy in this film, has had an up and down career with movies like Penthouse North and Tomorrow Your Gone, but she has still starred in some big budget movies like the Mission Impossible franchise and Gone Baby Gone. In this film, the chemistry between the two characters, old and young, were quite sweat and with all the things stacked up against them, it's good to see that there feelings for each other outweighed the bad. Anyway, it's worth a watch if your into your lovey dovey movies, and if your not, there's enough material to keep you entertained.Budget: $26million Worldwide Gross: $36millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic dramas about a couple who really loved each from a young age, but get torn apart after an unfortunate situation. 6/10",The Best of Me
14,lisafordeay,Very underrated and good spoilers at the end.,7,20 February 2019,"The Best Of Me is a 2014 Romantic Drama starring Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden and tells the tale of former childhood sweethearts Dawson Cole and Amanda who break up and are reunited 20 years later as a former friend of theirs died.Will the two concile,despite the fact Amanda is now a married woman with a teenage son?.
Overall this has got to be one of the darkest of Nicholas Sparks franchise as one of the charcthers gets murdered in the end of the film(Spoiler Alert) Dawson Cole dies as he gets caught by bad guys who shoved their truck near the trainwrecks and one of the hitmen shoots Dawson in the chest and he dies yet his heart works on Amanda's son in the end of the movie.If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks franchise than you will probably like this film.",The Best of Me
15,juneebuggy,Decent enough Nicholas Sparks romance.,5,9 April 2018,"You know what to expect before going into this: a star-crossed romance for lovers from different worlds, kisses in the rain, flashbacks, moonlight swims, fateful separations and the tragic death of at least one leading character.The scenery along the way is beautiful though and I enjoyed both the leads James Marsden & Michelle Monaghan but the story is pretty bland and I would say this in one of the weaker Nicholas sparks adaptions.It follows Amanda and Dawson, soul mates who met as teens, joining them decades later after they are torn apart by circumstances beyond their control. They of course have never forgotten each other and get a second chance when the passing of an old friend sees them ""willed"" back to his house to fulfill his final wishes. As they get reacquainted we flashback to them as teens, which was strangely done . It was meant to be 1993 but for some reason the director had it in his head to make it appear like the 1950's, with flouncy poodle skirts, drive ins and just a general feel. Honestly I won't remember this in about weeks time.",The Best of Me
16,ShelbyTMItchell,I Am A Romantic!,7,26 October 2014,"I a huge romantic. As love these kind of movies. And do not really understand the hatred over on the Chick Flicks. As these are what women like. As I went to the movies, there were women in the theater even me.But still this Nicholas Sparks adaptation. It is sad but also it is very much romantic. It is the story of two ex-lovers as adults, who used to be romantic as teens in the year 1992. A troubled boy living with an abusive father and a rich girl with snobby parents.But the boy finds a gruff but loving and understand old man that treats him like a human being and really wants to make something out of himself despite the circumstances he is in. And the girl wants to find her dreams as well. Sadly the romance ended badly in which you have to see and also understand why. But they reunite with the old man that took the boy in, twenty-two years later has passed away. Both really can't stand the sight of each other. The way it ended. Slowly yet sure, they wonder what could had been. As she is married to a drunken rich snob. He is still single despite having brief relationships. As the old man that died left them his will. Really I am an romantic for these type of movies. Bittersweet true, but still really romantic. Forget what the critics say. Be a romantic! See this film!",The Best of Me
17,Seraphion,A standard performing romance movie,5,17 January 2015,"I haven't read the novel yet, but for me the story feels kind of the standard romance that looks like an inverted version of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams' The Notebook, especially as the movie nears its ending. Interestingly for me, I made I a short movie with the same twist as this movie's ending back in 2012. For me the build feels quite strange due to the screenplay kind of failed in creating a good dual-focus movie. At first, the older version feels like it has less weight to the bigger picture than the younger version. This then changes as the weight shifts more to the older version, especially with the ending twist. The acting is just slightly above standard for me in overall. Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato have to train and work more on their facial expressions although I can say their body language has been quite good in this movie. James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan acted out quite good, enabling the older version of the story to gain more weight as the movie gets near its end.",The Best of Me
18,rgkarim,Not The Best of Sparks,5,17 October 2014,"Nicholas Sparks, a man whose books seem to sell millions and whose movies rake in even more money. How can something that is so formulary and repetitive, continue to be so popular? Still every year a movie of his comes out, masses of couples flood to the theaters to get wrapped up in the carbon copy that his movies. Of course here I sit, writing another review on his movie in an attempt to find the good in his latest installment entitled The Best of Me. So here I go, giving you the 411 on my first movie review of the weekend. Okay let's face it, a Nicholas Sparks movie is all about crying one's eyes out and getting caught up in the perfect vision of love that he makes. No surprise, this movie brings those components into the chemical mix. Fans will get caught in the roller coaster ride of kissing, giggling, hugging, and whatever else passes for romance. Like always, the relationship moves fast without too many hitches, a simple incident being blown over in a matter of seconds, like that's real right? With the magic of the cinematic score, the passion is captured on screen, despite the fact that some adultery and cheating are occurring. While lost on emotionless robot like me, there were plenty of members in my theater that cooed in awe at the emotional display on screen. As for the other emotions, well as is always the case it is a combination of sad and happy. A majority of this movie tends to bend towards the sadder side of things, with many incidents befalling our cast in the short 110 minutes. I give kudos to Sparks for integrating the hardships of his past into his writing, but his obsession with morbid outcomes and death are a little eye rolling for me. The Best of Me is again another movie where people die, often in predictable ways that somehow end up being good in the end. Realistic no? Inspirational/motivational, yes, because once again he manages to strike a chord that has you tearing up, getting goosebumps, or whatever reaction you have. I didn't get too much of a response, but that's because of two things: 1. It was predictable and things I see thirty minutes a way, I become stoic too 2. The unrealistic timing of all the things happening at once. Honestly, how drama like this isn't seen as ridiculous is beyond me, but if you think this is real enough I encourage you to give science fiction a try. Now to the story of this tale, which has very little twist and turn outside of the tear jerking sequences. This movie is predictable, the entire set of incidents pretty much are set up in the first half hour of the movie. The lead character Dawson (James Marsden) has some decent development, his bland and reserved nature explained to a decent extent that makes him the tragic hero. Of course some of his decisions and actions are a bit stupid, ill integrated, and frankly rushed at points. Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) was not the best character for this reviewer. Her back-story was sad, but she was a bit too pathetic, and needy in this film as she clung to her past. While I can relate to some of her issues, this wasn't one of the strongest leads for me. In fact the older renditions of the characters bored me, the chemistry between Marsden and Monaghan very stiff and forced. Instead the entertaining part was the story told through the younger counterparts played by Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato. Spread among their older self's lives, the past story is much more entertaining filled with not only better acting, but better plot points that had deeper emotions to them. Overall though, the plot has a lot of similarities with his other works, almost as if Sparks is running out of creative twists to take the movies in.The few factors that entertained me in this movie start with the character Tuck (Gerald McRaney), an old man who saves Dawson at the beginning. Tuck is the Yoda of this movie, a guide who provides valuable lessons with a nice sarcastic bluntness. His dialogue is simple at times, and delivered at just the right moment to maximize laughs. However, his quotes also pack a lot of emotional heat to it as well, designed and written in a form my own mentors have shared with me. He was a great character to tie everything together, and he had a lot of guts too. Second was the fact that the past and the present were interspersed. While I wished it had been done better, I always like to see a little mixing of past and present to build a better plot, though again it needs work. Finally the visual and audio moments are well put together, combined into a blend that packs the most power behind it. Let's wrap this up! The Best of Me was an okay addition to the library of Sparks dramas. Fans of Sparks are going to most likely love this installment, the simplistic romance and tear spurring moments playing the biggest part to their entertainment. For this reviewer, this was one of the lower quality installments in his movie. The plot was too discombobulated, the characters one dimensional and bland, and the unrealistic series of unfortunate events happening at once offset me on this. A love story such as this is a good girls night out movie, but I suggest revisiting an older film of his and wait for this on Netflix. My scores the Best of Me are:Drama/Romance: 6.5 Movie Overall: 4.5",The Best of Me

20,Bob-45,"Trite story, bad direction, poor casting, barely redeemed by performances",5,14 March 2015,"Good romantic films are almost as rare as good comedies. I really did not ask for anything special, as I like ""chick flicks"" and Hollywood has such a love affair with action movies, Hollywood has almost stopped making them. Nonetheless, I really disliked this one; because, even with the clichés, this movie had so much promise. The movie opens with a fine action sequence; and James Marsden is a really watchable actor. However, as soon as the parallel love stories begin, the movie falls apart. First of all ""young Amanda"" (Liana Liberato) not only does not look much like ""older Amanda"" (Michelle Monaghan), their body languages and acting styles are completely different. There is even a bigger disparity with ""young Dawson"" (Luke Bracey) and ""older Dawson"" (James Marsden). Thanks to terrific performances by Liana Liberato and Gerald McRaney, the flashback sequences are much more entertaining than the present sequences, even though Michael Hoffman's direction is much better in the present sequences. Hoffman shoots WAY too many of the flashback sequences as medium shots, when closeups would have been far better. Even the ending seems tacked on and trite.Except for Liana Liberato and Gerald McRaney, ""The Best of Me"" is anything but. I give ""The Best of Me"" a ""5"".",The Best of Me
21,MihaiSorinToma,A great movie which deserved a better ending,8,5 October 2017,"When a man and a woman meet as a result of a very close one's testament, their life flashes back before them, bringing memories of what amazing love story they had and how it could all have ended so abruptly. The emphasis is put on the past events, combining them with pieces of the present, elucidating till the end how it happened and what went so wrong.It's a dramatic plot, with many sad and hard situations being put on the main characters, putting their immense love into jeopardy. The present events reunite the two past lovers, awaking feeling which were thought lost forever, from twenty years ago when it all happened. It's an interesting course of events which keep you eager to find out what was the cause of the breakup and how it can end up. Unfortunately, the producers decided to create it as dramatic as possible, making a certain part of the past have a huge impact also on the present, thus bringing an unnecessary sad finale. After all they have been through in the past, it shouldn't have ended in such a manner which sort of proves the opposite of what the movie was trying to say.It's one of those movies which deserve a much better ending, one that can bring a light of hope and happiness to a much troubled couple which only wanted to be together till the end of time.",The Best of Me

Some people find true love, some look for it for whole of their lives and they never find it.Acting was OK for this type of film. Actors really tried their best to make this film work.

But after seeing it... I want my time back, because this is one of the worst romance movies I've seen this year. You know those really bad cliché romance movies with no excitement just boring and uninspiring story that's been done a thousand times, well this movie takes the cake from being the worse of the worse. Name every bad romance cliché that you could think of right now, well it's all in this crappy movie.Some of the acting in this movie is so bland and so forgettable.

So it looked like a guy way out of school with a girl in school.There was zero chemistry between the two older leads.The representation of the guy's dad and home life was a bit over-the-top. His dad treated him like he was someone who bumped into him in a bar. I know that abuse exists, but this was really out there. Didn't child services ever come by to see what's going on at this house? Adultery is treated like it's nothing. But there's no indication that either character would take it lightly. They were nice people, so they would feel super guilty, not blissful.If they are both from the same small town, had the old man's friendship in common, and both still lived in the same state, why wouldn't they have seen each other before 21 years? I do love a good romance and the idea of destiny, etc. Those aspects of the story were enjoyable. I also enjoyed the photography of Louisiana. But something was definitely missing. It's hard to believe that the guy had no women in his life or non-corrupt family members somewhere. Didn't the old man have his own children? James Marsden was o.k., but I never felt that Michelle Monaghan had her heart in this one at all. Casting is so crucial in most films, but especially in romantic dramas.

There is a slightly confusing part near the end where the timings don't jive, but me and my family knew what they meant. Another viewer said this movie was better than the novel it was based upon called 'The Grand Design' by Nicholas Sparks, but I have not read it so I can't give you my opinion.

He is not really bad but nothing sticks out and like in this movie is usually hired to look good. I give both the benefit of the doubt because nobody could make this work.
By ""this"" I mean dialog that gives the words cringe worthy a whole new meaning. Which brings me to the childish attempt of direction here. This movie lacks any subtlety. Everything is spit in the face obvious. Every scene with heaven in the background has this very bad computer colored clouds in yellow and pink. If you would count cliches here your head would explode. Examples: Disapproving parents, check, corny rain scene, check, girl sitting on a white swing, check and the list goes on.

35,bob-rutzel-239-525430,Very Good Love Story,10,23 May 2015,"Dawson (James Marsden) and Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) reunite after 20-years apart. They were teenage lovers, but life interfered and each went their separate way. They are brought together again via their friend Tuck (Gerald McRaney) who took a liking to both and a sort of protective father to the young Dawson (Luke Bracey), who was subjected to an abusive father Tommy Cole (Sean Bridges).This is a very good love story and you will need a box of Kleenex to get through it. Maybe two. All this works due to the performance of the younger Amanda (Liana Liberato) who is full of life, love and perception. and who we see in flashbacks with the younger Dawson. When we see the older Amanda we remember the younger Amanda and hope we see some of the younger Amanda in her. Takes a while but we do see that from time to time. But Liberato's performance trumps all because we are constantly reminded of her strong performance throughout regardless of what younger or older version of her we see. I don't think this movie would have the impact it has if it were not for Liana Liberato. Yes, I am a big fan. An Oscar for Liana Liberato? Definitely. The chemistry between the younger Dawson and the younger Amanda is pure gold mostly because of the younger Amanda. Hey, still a fan (we see that).There are some bumps along the way for both the younger and older Dawson with Tommy the abusive father and Dawson's brothers. Even though these are the bad guys in here they did a bang up job.We see a lot of Tuck throughout in flashbacks and wish he was in the present, but he leaves the cabin to both of them in the hope they would reunite as he knew the hardships both have endured and he also knew they loved each other. I wouldn't mind if Gerald McRaney got an Oscar nod too as he was exceptional in here.There is a twist in here and when you see it, you should already be on that 2nd Kleenex box. The entire cast performed exceedingly well, but you will remember the younger Amanda for a long, long time (still a fan, I see). Hey, I'm serious about that Kleenex box. Actually two.

36,supatube,The best of something else.,4,9 December 2014,"""The Best Of Me"" opens with a very romantic shot of a colorful sky, hinting at being the greatest romance ever told but it doesn't take long to dwindle into a lonely person's ideal of romance. This piece of tripe is unwittingly offensive and difficult to keep the personal points out. Heavy spoiler alert coming up:Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) and Dawson (James Marsden) are former high school lovers who reunite after twenty-one years of separation through the death of a mutual friend, Tuck (Gerald McRaney). Tuck has left a romantic cottage, jointly, for the pair in his will. Their initial encounter of each other is awkward but slowly their familiarity, in spite of the years apart, begins to reignite. As obvious as this might be, in terms of romance story development, the film still manages to captivate.Cut back to the summer of 1992 where Amanda (Liana Liberto) and Dawson (Luke Bracey) meet and the possible reasons for not ending up together - she's filthy rich and he is common white trash – start to surface. More obvious romance plot points but still not the spot where the story nose-dives. Dawson runs away from his abusive home and finds shelter in Tuck's garage. This beautiful story of a man helping out a boy in need is so powerful but never scrapes the surface. As if it isn't romantic? How often do strangers help each other out in real life like this? The two form a love not based on familial aspects but that's exactly where it grows to, a sort father son relationship. It's there; it could have been fleshed out more (especially when Major Dad looks eager to deliver).The chemistry between the young couple is where the story ceases to climb. Luke Bracey looks like a man graduating from college not high school. His hair is blond whereas James Marsden is dark. The difference in their height is so obvious that Dawson looks like he has shrunk over the past two decades. The man is such an odd casting you cant help but think that his appendages are a visual stimuli for the target audience over serving the story. Older women don't wanna watch a nineteen year old boy pruning without his shirt, they want a twenty-five year old man pretending to be nineteen ploughing the garden without his shirt. And the shirtless shots were so blatantly vapid it was like watching light porn for old aged, conservative women. So now it's getting lame but romance can so often get lame. And the offense begins: because of my penis I apparently cant get this story, that's its beyond my scope of feelings. Really? I blame my rational mind and the fact that I have fallen in love on why I cant get this film. I can relate to never forgetting a first love, a love that changes us from the core. A connection that seems too easy to rekindle every time our eyes meet. Although Amanda and Dawson are sweet to each other they lack heat. And if you can relate to the idea of an enigmatic first love I 'm sure we can vouch that, for the most part, what makes it so magical is the heat. It's your first, how do you stop banging? The story is falling, when does it crash? Sometimes falling in love can be so overwhelming that it makes us want to run but losing someone we love can be more overwhelming to the point where we feel we are dying. Could the emotion be more intense for loss than elation? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But if a narrative is to touch on both aspects surely both emotions on either side of the same see-saw should be grappled with the same intensity? Relishing in the euphoria of love is the same as lamenting on the loss of that love through death. Her loss is not felt at all. Setting character aside, this plot point also seems to suggest that true love is momentary, that true love can never really exist. How cynical.The story has crashed; does it go up in flames? Oh yes it does. Amanda's son is in hospital desperate for a heart transplant and her now dead lover is the perfect specimen. So his heart lives on in her son Jesus Christ, surely reading this review is causing a little bit of nausea? The subtle special effects are really good and the acting, to spite the miscast aspect, is on point. But there is no saving a story hell bent on transforming love from something real into something mystical. Maybe it's just a film for someone who has never fallen in love? And probably never will if this is their idea of romance.",The Best of Me

First it starts as a typical boy meets girl flashback story. That part lasted really long, was interesting in some moments, but in summary it was just mediocre. If that part was a movie by itself, I would fall asleep. The characters don't have any interesting dialogues, we don't see the connection between these two happening. They just fall in love and we are supposed to believe it- well, ok. But then the story takes some really unnecessary plot twists, that ruined the mediocre formulaic story and made it into a mess. It seemed like they mixed 3 different movies into one, just to make it interesting. What I hoped this would be is something like ""Blue Jay"", where the movie focuses only on two people with great chemistry interacting with each other.

40,redx1708,They kept adding cheese upon cheese.,2,31 August 2019,"This review is probably one big spoiler, so you may not want to read any further, (although I'll recommend it if you don't wanna waste your time, and I should know cause i surely wasted mine), but here goes the plot. High school kids Amanda (WASP girl) and Dawson (white trailer trash) meet and falls madly in love. Then he goes to prison, and being all noble and sir Galahad, he refuses to see her anymore and tells her to forget him and get on with her life. So after sometime she marries an asshole husband and have 2 kids, one of them dying of cancer after 2 years.
Then after 20 years they meet again and find out that they are still madly in love. The plot works in 2 timelines, and you may wonder why the younger versions of the two don't bear any resemblance to the older ones. Anyway the guy dies and she's heartbroken, but it makes her get out of her marriage and supposedly live a happy and fulfilling life thereafter. So this is obviously a TITANIC sort of plot. No happy ending, no sir :) The problem is that everything is so predictable. Like the pregnant girl begging her boyfriend not to join the hero in a family showdown. (Right, this dude won't be coming back). Or when her son is fatally injured and needs a new heart, (oh, a new heart just came in, how convenient). Then the hero gets shot and killed by his dad, (gee, i wonder where his heart went). Years later the son finds out that the heart was from our guy,(BIG surprise !!) and when he tells his mom she smiles sadly, knowing that her true love will now always be a part of her through her son.

43,sq8188-162-458059,The Best of Nicolas Sparks Don't Miss,10,1 February 2021,"Having just seen ""The Choice"", another Nicolas Sparks movie which I find enjoyable - moved by great dialog and titulating chemistry between the lead characters, but the plot was simple - ""The Best of Me"" is much more intricately woven, infused with great trauma and tragedy . Now I understand why Sparks fans rave about this novel over his other works. Mr Sparks is a model of
efficiency - every character has a precise role in this screen play. While the interleaving of young Dawson and Amanda's love story with present day reunion takes some getting used to but you'd find the story ultimately satisfying. The story begins interestingly of two former lovers called to a
reading of the will at an athorney's office after an old friend passed away. Tuck,the old friend was a father figure to young Dawson who took Dawson in when he ran away from an abusive father. And he also defended him when the Dawson clan came for him. The wise & benevolent Tuck bequeathed his estate to both of them. Because of a deep hurt and abandonment due to tragic
circumstance, Amanda is cool at first upon seeing Dawson yet they have to spend time together to clear the belongings. Old memory is rekindled. Soon, everything that drawn them together as young lovers slowly returned, until they become fully engaged in each other again. The morning after spending a passionate night, Amanda takes a call from her teenage son. It is the usual mom thing. ""I'd see you soon, love ya"" says Amanda in closing the call. Dawson senses their moral quandry that Amanda has a life, a family to return to, tells her ""We really can't do this, can we?"". The story kicks into another gear when Amanda returns to her husband. I will not spoil the meticulous plot. Sparks' book is structured with multi-layers around the central characters. While it is not high literature, but it still strikes the right cords, asking some profound questions, especially the letters from Tuck to Dawson and Amanda, and the letter from Dawson to Amanda after she returned home. If you are like me, you'll find this movie highly gratifying and come away loving that special someone even more than before.",The Best of Me

45,jacob-m-ford97,Where we going with this?,4,26 October 2014,"So far this year, I've seen ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" I've seen ""22 Jump Street,"" ""Let's Be Cops,"" ""Tammy,"" heck I've even seen ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" and I have ""Dumb and Dumber To"" later this year. Even so, I can undoubtedly say that ""The Best of Me"" is the funniest movie of 2014. Too bad it isn't a comedy.""The Best of Me"" is the latest hot wind coming from romance author Nicholas Sparks. Sparks, and the movie based on his book, revolutionized the romance genre with the Chick-Flick classic ""The Notebook."" The only problem was that after the success of ""The Notebook,"" they have since tried to revolutionize over and over and over. This is the seventh attempt at a revolution. The storyline, or rather the excuse for makeout scenes, for this movie is found in Dawson: a very attractive and buff man who, after a traumatic accident, learns the man who raised him has passed away. He returns to his hometown to take care of legal matters, and while he's there he reconnects with his beautiful high school sweetheart, Amanda, who is now married. Through a series of flashbacks we learn of their passionate, ignorance-fueled love they had while they were teenagers and exactly how much of that love has remained.Luke Bracy and Liana Liberato played the younger, and conveniently more attractive versions of Dawson and Amanda. I almost felt bad for them as they are clearly trying to jumpstart their professional acting careers, and this movie was an unfortunate step in the wrong direction. Their older versions, however were played by professional actors James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan who have already achieved that fame coveted by those young actors. Whenever these movies come out with celebrity actors starring, I always get confused because, at least from the limited people I know, these movies are always laughable and taints our opinions of those actors. It hardly matters how good a job they do, the fact that they were in a Nicholas Sparks movie just somehow destroys all talent.The director, Michael Hoffman, is a man with many great romance film credits to his name: ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" ""One Fine Day,"" and ""The Last Station,"" among others. I have a feeling that from now on he will be putting those films on his resume and not this one. Now, it can be a good thing for a movie to have clichés, they are clichés for a reason because they work. But at some point, as a director, you have to realize when it's just too much. Within the first minute of this movie's start we have a circling, wide-angle, helicopter shot of an oil rig at sunset with seagulls calling in the back. Within five minutes of the movie's start we have a man looking to the stars to connect with his long lost love who is conveniently looking to the stars at the exact same time. And within ten minutes of the movie's start we have a dirty man in a very tight tank-top running through fire to save someone after a dramatic explosion. This continued through the entire movie as a boy ran away from home in the rain, the first kiss coming after the boy hands the girl a rose, and an out-of-the-blue salute to a retired military man (my personal favorite part of the film.) Like I said, clichés can work, but at some point enough is enough.I'm not a particular fan of romance films and like to jokingly ridicule them to those who do by pointing out the stupid parts. The defense I always receive when I do usually goes: ""Okay, but the story is so good! They're good people in real love!"" I may receive that response for this one too, but in this case that defense is entirely false. This is a movie about two people who fall in love during high school. For a reason I won't spoil, they disconnect before college and later reconnect in their forties and passionately make love. By the time they've met up again, he's still a single man. She, however, has been married to a different man for eighteen years and has a son about to finish high school. In a nutshell, this movie is about an affair. I don't care how much love there was between them, she made a vow to her husband and eighteen years later she cut it off and the only reason we have to be on her side is that the man she married drinks alcohol. And all this leaving her son whose life will now be permanently ruined because his mother was selfish.I laughed really hard when I watched this movie because there were so many stupid parts I could laugh at, but then the question occurred to me: what kind of story was Sparks trying to tell?

46,JSplend954,"Unfortunately this got ""The Best of Me""",2,26 October 2014,"I believe all of Nicholas Sparks's movies are based on his books/novels, and they mostly center around Romance, Passion, and Tragedy. Sparks must be running out of ideas because to sum it up, ""The Best of Me"" was wayyyyyy to long, very predictable, and monotone to the point that it was listless.Due to the fact this movie was so drawn out, I had such a lack of interest, that while I was watching it, I was thinking about all sorts of things, like what I'm going to do the next day, what to pick up at the store. The producers dragged out the flashback scenes in a way that you had no idea as far as the direction of this movie. There was no correlation regarding the younger lead male character and that person twenty years later.The ending: Even though I was half concentrating on this movie, I still predicted the outcome regarding the conclusion.Nicholas Sparks has had some great movies ""The Notebook"", ""A Walk to Remember"", Dear John"", but I would recommend taking a pass regarding ""The Best of Me"".",The Best of Me

The movie was one of the worst romantic films ever, the plot of the film was repeated in a very banal way, the ending was stupid and far from logic, and add to that (depressing) !! Why?!
A child is about to die in a car accident. His heart is injured (about to loss its beats) ... and Boom! he's now in dire need of an urgent heart transplant. And by the strange coincidence (his mother's former lover gets shot and dies in a completely distant state) and by chance again ..

Regardless of the end, this is a great screening of the book by Nikolas Sparks.

Sounds kinda corny, but for me, it touched on some areas. Well, needless to say, we held hands all during the movie and more later.Okay, so I read up on the reviews before coming to see this movie and they all made it sound like a boring box office flop, BUT reviews can be very deceiving because this was a diamond that was tarnished by viewers who had NO clue what a romantic flick this really is about!

However even so they're still attracted by one another, having a huge regret for the past. As for the editing, you will notice the unique way of it. It is usual that story goes through with the passage of the time, but in the story, initially it tells about the current circumstance of them, and as the time goes by, the past stories are inserted one by one. Therefore, you will gradually figure out their past relationship as well as the recent ones. In addition to that, it is also interesting that the story focuses on when they're grown-up rather than when they are youth. Generally speaking, most of the love stories tend to mention love in youth but this movie relies on the irregular way. To sum up, you can enjoy how their love move forward with the unusual style of description.",The Best of Me

Golf is about sportsmanship, dedication, comradery, and overcoming insurmountable odds (it's a darn hard game), not a lazy writer's vehicle to portray a bad husband just because the said writer does not feel like doing real writing. Secondly, the whole process by which Amanda and Cole fall in love, especially Amanda, is written without credible details or believability. I mean A+B=C, not A straight to C. However, what saves this movie is the beautiful portrayal and display of the love, which is breath-taking at times and appeals to the primal core of humanity. No matter how it came about or how it may end up, the state of being in love was expressed with eye-searing vividness and effervescent lighting. It's something every human being desperately wants but rarely finds. Even if found, it usually does not last that long. I suppose the version I watched was the alternate version. The original version's endings sounds too much like a highschooler's first attempt at writing a tear-jerker, not something I would want to sit through.",The Best of Me

Sadly it's only to warn people of the very sad and depressing ending. I briefly thought when it was said that the son needed a new heart, that that might happen but the odds of a match are so ridiculous, that I ruled it out. It was a wonderful film up until the last 10 mins, great story with good acting, loved the flashbacks (except, if I'm nitpicking, the 'younger' Dawson looked too old and tall but I see they had Paul Walker lined up for the role so the height would make sense) but what happened with that ending?

For instance, in the novel, Dawson comes from a bad family and he's enemies with all of his cousins. However, in the beginning of the movie, it seems like he's best friends with one of them and he's enemies with the others. I was also upset that we only got a glimpse as to how Dawson's father and his two cousins treated him. Additionally, in the middle of the movie, I was confused as to what happened to Dawson's best friend/cousin's son. Maybe I need to see the movie again because I only remember seeing him briefly and how he's being treated.

You never see him remove it, so your mind races to think ""hey maybe she'll give it to him later"", but nope, never happens. On another note, it doesn't make sense to show one character to be drinking and about to drive, then in the very next scene have them go to the hospital due to an crash (drink and drive) that isn't that character, it's confusing.The movie takes a misleading turn towards the end like they ripped your heart out, and showed it to you while they drank the blood with a straw. The ending was sad, but one thing at the end really left me disappointed as it was going for a good ending (and it tugs you towards this constantly), but no it slams your hand in the door on the way in.I really enjoyed the performances of Tuck, the younger Dawson, and young Amanda. I really liked the way they went between time periods to unravel the story, but just it really derailed once they stopped doing that, and threw a curve ball right at your hip.

Perhaps this is a bit of a spoiler, but I find that most of his endings will leave the reader (and the movie viewer) with much disappointment (i.e. Nights in Rodanthe, The Lucky One, Dear John). ""The Best of Me"" is definitely not one of the best of Nicholas Sparks, nor is it one of the best for movie goers.

The casting choices for the young versions of our leads is, again, confusing. But i think people miss the certain parts of the story that make it special. The parallels between Tuck (Dawson's father figure) and adult dawson falling in the water and thinking of their lovers is interesting. Then the parallels between dawson drinking and driving in the end and Amanda's son getting in a drinking and driving accident is also interesting. Tuck saved dawson and now dawson saves Amanda's son. Then, of course, dawson being shot after accidentally shooting his cousin. OH also! The wardrobe?? I couldn't place the setting of this movie. They're all wearing clothes from 2014. I'm confused. I don't know i think the story itself had potential in the way paperback drug store novels do. The movie leaves something to be desired.

Now, for the plot. A not so lucky good boy, Dawson, born into a family of criminals meets a privileged popular cheerleader girl, Amanda, that's got the hots for him while he on the other hand feels that she is out of his league. He runs away from home after refusing to commit a crime with his father and ends up sleeping in a garage. The owner, Tuck, lets him stay. The girl sees the good in him while he loves and appreciates her until an accident makes him end up in jail. Dawson stopped accepting visits and tells Amanda to move on. She does just that by having children and getting married but keeps Tuck in her life. 21 years later they reunite after Tucks death. Romance unfolds and sparks fly as they reminisce about the true love they once shared which makes Amanda have some tough decisions to make, until something drastic happens.",The Best of Me

It was way too predictable, and the acting is bad, the storytelling even worse.If you are a 12-year old who's a bit slow this is the movie for you. The story is like any other Nicholas Sparks story, full of love and tragedy, all of that is becoming a little bit boring. Oh, and the cheesy lines like ""You want me to fall back in love with you? How do I do that if I haven't ever stopped?"" like please who speak like that in the real world. Sparks I love you, but c'mon!I wasn't feeling it. For example I could cry every time I watch 'The Notebook', but this one did not trigger any emotions in my case.To shorten: boring, predictable, bad acting, bad storytelling...and I liked the flowers though.",The Best of Me

98,xorayyrayyxo,The Best of Me,9,10 September 2015,"""The Best of Me"" is a movie about a pair of former high school sweethearts who reunite after many years when they return to visit their small hometown after the death of a close friend. I absolutely love this tragic love story. Although, the ending had me in tears I could not help but smile as well. The movie is a series of flashbacks between the present day characters, who are now in their mid 30s, and their former high school romance. Ultimately, the main character Dawson dies, but the hospital ends up donating his heart to the other main character's, Amanda, son who is dying of cancer. This event in itself significantly impacted my overall view of the movie because it was so unexpected. Although, this event was tragic it also forms a sense of happiness. Amanda, now knowing that Dawson's heart went to her son still feels Dawson will always be in her life no matter what. Aside from this moving event I also found myself often relating to the main characters. This is why I found myself so engage throughout the entire movie. I could not take my see off the screen once. The chemistry between the two main characters sparked my interest as well. Throughout the movie I found myself sharing the same values as the girl character in the story, which many may also be able to relate. She valued respect, honesty, and compassion. She also looked for these characteristics in a man. In this way I can strongly relate to her character and take interest in her words and actions. The structure of movie was also done very well in my opinion. The transitions between the present day and flashbacks kept my focus on the movie. This movie is excellent for anyone interested in romantic dramas.",The Best of Me
99,aliceboud,"A terrible film, do not waste your time on this",2,22 April 2016,"The Best Of Me is the first Nicholas Sparks movie that I have watched, and after the experience that I had it is likely to be the last.Needlessly over-dramatic, I found myself rolling my eyes at the ridiculous situations that these characters got into more and more as this film went on. Nothing seems to add up in this movie, from the fact that the past versions of the two main characters looked nothing like the present versions (which was a minor area but nevertheless frustrating) to the 'plot twists' that were cringe-worthy and downright stupid. This film was poorly acted too, with clichéd and unconvincing performances from all the characters. This was unsurprising due to the awful script, which seemed lazy and boring. To sum it up, this film was one of the worst I've seen in a while-I finished it almost ashamed that I'd sat through the whole thing. If you want to see a romantic film, there are plenty of good ones out there, there is no need to waste your time on this mushy incoherent mess.",The Best of Me
100,rbakas,It's a 90-Minute Super Bowl Ad for Budweiser,4,12 April 2018,"Nicholas Sparks hit paydirt when The Notebook came out. Everything coalesced perfectly with the story and actors who portrayed the characters in the movie. The Notebook elevated Sparks to another level as a writer.Since then, Sparks has tried to recapture the magic of The Notebook by remixing the story and trying to retell it over and over with different twists at the end. That's one reason I've lost respect for Nicholas Sparks as a writer. He's basically rehashing the same ideas in different order.The Best of Me is basically a 90-minute Super Bowl ad for Budweiser. The product placement is so intentionally that it's actually distracting. There must have been 10 different scenes with Bud placed 'just so' in order for the viewing audience to see the label.James Marsden (Dawson) was great in The Notebook, and he's great in this movie. He and Michelle Monaghan are really the only thing that makes this movie bearable. Their character development was solid, but the rest of the characters including Tuck, their elderly BFF who for some reason was friends with both characters, and Monaghan's on-screen husband was weak.As a side note, the younger actor who played Dawson and James Marsden look NOTHING like each other. It was pretty distracting to follow the story with two guys playing the same character who didn't even 'kind of' look the same.We never really know why Dawson's dad is such a jerk. They look nothing like each other, and Dawson's dad looks to be about the same age. They hate each other through forced tension that eventually leads to an unbelievable climax at the end where Dawson gets shot by his dad from about 100 yards away for no good reason. I don't know why any dad would do what is portrayed in this movie.I supposed the need to have something dramatic was the impetus for the scene where Dawson had to die some terrible death, but it just wasn't believable. Perhaps Sparks couldn't gone and pulled some other scene from The Notebook and rehashed that instead.Finally, the lighting and cinematography of this film was off. It was too bright and fuzzy in a number of the scenes that made it look more like a dream sequence than what was supposed to be happening.From here on out, just watch The Notebook instead of Sparks rehashing and remixing The Notebook into something less than spectacular.",The Best of Me

110,tomarenich,Solid drama,4,10 January 2015,"I haven't read the book so I can't judge if the movie is better or worse. I can say though that Best of Me shouldn't be judged for plenty predictable turns. It's a love story after all, no matter how hard you try, it will end up as a story about love between two people. So it is predictable, but it's a well filmed beautiful love story, with plenty of lovely shots and quite good acting. Still, I can't say that the script was well done and here's why. (Be careful, huge spoilers to come). We can predict from the start that this love story won't have a happy ending. So many things in dialogs are completely unnecessary. For example, when Amanda got a call from her son, we can figure out that something is going to happen just because he calls. She doesn't have to say anything about bad drivers and all that. Basically, in that moment we can stop watching the movie because that's exactly the moment where we find out the final, not in the actual end of the film. And there are quite many moments like that, unfortunately. But all in all, it's a good drama, and I bet everyone with a heart cried at least a bit in the end, no matter how much he figured out before. And that's what this movie is all about, it's not a rule breaker but quite solid film which honestly follows rules of classical love drama.",The Best of Me

That being said I was excited to get to see this film in advance so I could tell people about it before it even came out.The Best of Me fell way short of the typical Sparks adaptations. It was so cheesy it hurt to watch. Sure this is the way most romance movies are done now, but at least most films find a way to do them more discretely. Some of the lines were so blatantly stupid that I just couldn't help but laugh, even when all of the older women around me were bawling their eyes out.The story and acting were just okay, nothing new really, other than a few twists that were poorly executed.

So within the span of like 4 days, Dawson gets into a fatal accident that he somehow survives, Tuck dies, Dawson and Amanda make up, Amanda's son needs and GETS a heart transplant, AND Dawson dies???????? And then, to top it all off, it turns out DAWSON was the one who donated the heart!!!!!!I'm done with movies about grown women having mid life crises and deciding to be unfaithful in pursuit of some childish pleasure. And the make up scene between them was so much like the Notebook, it was boring. If I were Sparks' wife, I would NOT trust him around other women.. he is obsessed with the idea of infidelity. And then that ridiculous Seven Pounds ending??? And what's with good, rich girls always falling for the boys from bad families that they can never end up with without disappointing their parents?

Even the acting got worse and worse as the movie went on. I love Michelle Monaghan, but it feels like she gave up on the movie and mailed in her performance. James ""Superman"" Marsden was like a bad TV soap actor and young Liana Liberato's over-acting was painful to watch at times. I'm sure she's a gifted actress but seems like no one directed this disaster. With a bit of guidance from the director and cutting some of the useless daytime-drama plot turns out of it, it could've been a half way decent ""chick flick"".

I know I know, James Marsden was cast after Paul Walker passed away but the younger Dawson didn't resemble Paul Walker either. He has very strong features (long face, smaller eyes) and it was distracting how little he looked like his older version. The Australian accent also peaked out at times. 2. Did anyone else find this as predictable as I did? I called the cousin dying when he went to help Dawson. I called Dawson dying after her son needed a new heart. I even called the daughter having passed away after Amanda's reaction to seeing the picture. I mean, come on. 3. The older couple had so little chemistry I really didn't care whether they ended up together or not. Their first kiss after not seeing each other for 21 years and being each others first ""loves"" was so dry and emotionless. 4. The ending was just bogus. She's a paralegal and advising a lawyer a year later, with no college or law degree?? It's a shock that it was Dawson's heart? Yea... OK.Whatever.

Really nasty over used dirty duct tape. I love James Marsden but this just didn't work for him. So disappointed and frustrated. They didn't even get the characters stories right and I think that's where it all went to hell. Hoping the next one isn't butchered too. I think if the ""Longest Ride"" is worse, Sparks and Hollywood should call it quits or take a break. The magic is gone or they've used most of it up.

I was telling my friend each dialogue that the actors were gonna say and scenes that were gonna happen before they happened. And the same thing happened! The dialogues were lame and repeated. There were some people who cried watching the movie in the theatre so maybe its just me. If this was the first romantic movie I've ever seen I may have liked it.

Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato really do an awesome job as the young Dawson and Amanda and I love Michelle Monoghan and James Marsden as their older versions. Gerald McRaney is perfectly cast as Tuck, Dawson's ""surrogate"" father. The scenery/decor is amazing on screen especially Tuck's garden en the water tower. The only negative is the predictable and obviously unwanted ending. As soon as Jared was in the hospital you knew what the outcome would be. It also went a little too fast, like they quickly had to put an end to it. I loved The Horsewhisperer and like that book/movie the male lead was the hero and also the ""loser"" of the story.

136,mrskatiekimball06,Beautiful Love story,8,17 June 2015,I will start by saying I'm very picky on love movies i watch. But this movie tops my list. It was a beautiful love story. I love how it takes you back to show you their story from the beginning. I was however a little disappointed with the very different looks in the young and older version of the male roles. Also the younger version was a little older than he should have been i thought. Even though both actors played their parts very well. Very well done on the young actress and older actress i thought they looked very similar and the acting on their part was very well. This move gave a great amount of action and love and a little drama. Was just overall very pleased with the movie. I recommend this to anyone .,The Best of Me

I was missing that excitement that woes me off my feet and makes me believe in romance. I kept getting really bored while watching it.I found it really hard to relate of like the characters. They were just bland. The way they fell in love doesn't even seem worthy of a movie. Maybe the book was better, not sure since I haven't read it.

FAIL",4,18 October 2014,"Having thought the Notebook actually had a GOOD ending, and reading about 10% of the book which I thought excellent we decided to see this movie. The young partners were a total mismatch for the older and I could feel nothing between them but a script. If you are going to have a story in which 2 kids fall so deeply in love their separation ruins both their lives completely except for 2 days 21 years later, only to have that be a tease, for the UTTERLY predictable end, the relationship had better show up on screen as ELECTRIFYING. BTW Dawson spitting on the car? Not credible.

140,verstute,Are you happy?,9,26 January 2015,"I don't read the book (I'll hope I do it in the near future) but I like the film very much. It makes me think a lot about the life, especially, about the second chances.. Sometimes if people want something, they should do it and try it and fight for it. Because sometimes there is no second chances. Like the words from soundtrack ""I wanna fall in love again. But this time.. But this time.."" The sadness thing is then Amanda decide to tell her husband about her feelings to Dawson and it looks like everything will be alright. But suddenly everything turns over upside down: her son gets in the car accident. While Dawson faces up with his dad. Actually, I don't understand how can be such a bad (I should write it in capital letters) person like Dawson's dad. He don't care about others, he don't't have the goals in his life or maybe his goal is making mess in other lives. It'll be better if he would never go back from the prison. So.. When Amanda hears about what happen to Dawson it makes me really to cry.. One thing - that Dawson's heart go to Amanda's son it was not a surprise for me. But the one thing was clear - his heart will always be alive, always be with his lover and always loves. Because they found the true love. Many so many people don't imagine and realize what is the love, what does it mean to love and love back. They found each other and it was the best thing for them ever happen. But life isn't perfect. Sometimes life is sadness, unhappy, cruel. And when people ask ""Are you happy?"" you can answer ""yes"" or ""no"". In this movie people feel all the purest feelings but in the end of the movie the answer of the question is ""No"". Because it is life..",The Best of Me
141,nickharlow2,Something Unexpected,8,17 October 2014,"This is not a typical Nicholas Sparks adaptation.Yes, this film is cheesy, this film's corny, this film's cliché. But to judge this film based on that alone is to completely ignore the context and conventions of its genre. It's not a ground- breaking film by any means, but it is ground-breaking if we're talking about Romances, specifically Sparks adaptations.Anyone complaining about the typical formula (i.e., girl meets boy, girl's family doesn't like boy's family, the two lovers persevere, etc.) clearly hasn't seen this movie. Amanda (the female protagonist)'s father does fall into the typical mold of a disapproving, upper-class father who wants the boyfriend out of the picture so his daughter can have a bright future. But unlike a slew of other Romances (and even Sparks' own adaptations), he's in the film for a very, very brief amount of time. In fact, I'd go so far as to say he's not at all crucial to the film. If anything, his part was intended to play to the demographic and nothing else, which while regrettable, should say something about how this film stands up on its own without relying on clichésI noted that film deals with real-life issues. We see issues of class, family, and self-esteem illustrated much better than most Sparks adaptations I've seen. Sean Bridgers knocks it out of the park with his downright of patriarch and sociopath Tommy Cole, father of protagonist Dawson Cole. The Cole clan in particular - a gang of drug-dealing(?), abusive, sickos really deserving of the title ""white trash"" - brings this film to life. They represent a segment of society that we rarely ever get to see on screen. This film, unlike some of Sparks' other works, does not cast a glowing light on the White South, and instead we get to the gritty, shameful parts that actually made me forget what movie I was watching. On top of all that, we get to see the consequences of trying to break away from the most perverted ""families"" that are present in every-day life. We get to see how that cycle of anger, shame, and ostracism fuels the dirty (and violent) blood feuds that still exist in the underbelly of this country. Luke Bracey shows us what it's like for a young person dealing with this life, to have their ambitions silenced, and the true pain that comes with leaving one's family.Above all, this film speaks to regret. (Spoilers ahead) All the tragedies and hardships that meet the protagonists, unlike previous Sparks adaptations, actually don't pull them together. We do see some of that smarmy ""Life's hard but we still love each other anyway"" stuff throughout the film, but for once we get to see that narrative broken. Dawson's and Amanda's relationship gets tested, and for a while it goes on, but ultimately Dawson's predicament proves too dark for their relationship to hold out. It seems cliché for him to cut if off while in jail, but isn't that what we saw in The Hurricane (1999) and other great films? This is a film about love, and the sacrifice that Dawson makes is really believable considering that. After taking separate paths, both characters have to deal with that regret and questions of ""what if?""The issue of casting is one that shouldn't be ignored, but one that can't rightly be criticized too much in the case of Marsden. The late Paul Walker, the original choice for Adult Dawson, would have bared more resemblance to Bracey, but we can't fault Marsden or anyone working on this film for having to deal with that circumstance. Marsden pulls it off in the end. Does he do it as well as Walker would have? We may never know, and it's pretty disrespectful to even ask the question, as many reviewers are doing. This film is what it is. The end (spoilers ahead) really tripped me up. Yes, it's so cliché that I couldn't believe it for a minute, but this film is about coincidences and fate, so after considering that, it's not fair to judge it based on statistics. This is a realm that crosses from the sordid into the miraculous. But really - and this is something I didn't even notice until after walking out of the theater - what really tested the limits of this genre was that this wasn't a happy ending. It was a bittersweet and somewhat cheesy ending, sure, but it wasn't happy. They don't end up together. The last notes are in a way quite comforting, but unresolved. Maybe some people don't like that, but I sure did. What happens to Amanda's son? Yes, he lives, but how does he feel about his parents' divorce? Did they even divorce? What happens to Aaron? And, by the way, Robby Rasmussen deserves a damned Oscar for playing two characters so well. What about Amanda? We aren't sure if she ever really moves on. What are her regrets? Does she have any regrets left at all, or maybe a whole new set of regrets?This film takes some getting used to and some further consideration beyond what's happening on the surface. On the surface, it's just another Romance, but it takes a little more thought. For being so panned for its formulaic nature, this film challenged a lot conventions not only followed by Sparks, but by the whole genre of Romance. It's interesting, to say the very least, and is well worth the watch.",The Best of Me
142,bml157,Not recommended,4,17 October 2014,"Very disappointed. The casting director did a poor job. No chemistry between the younger or older versions of Amanda and Dawson. Out of the four, I especially disliked younger Amanda and thought she was an extremely bad fit for the role. The chemistry between her and younger Dawson was lacking. I reminisced throughout about The Notebook and how this could not compare in the least bit, and how much more chemistry was had between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. The plot was the most predictable I have seen in quite some time. I yawned very much throughout the film and could not get past how elementary the plot was, how little chemistry the main characters had, the fact that the younger Amanda didn't fit the part, and the fact that the older and younger versions of Dawson looked nothing alike. It felt like a made-for-TV movie to me and I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the theater, that's for sure. James Marsden and Luke Bracey are good actors. I can't take anything away from them. There was just more wrong with this film than right, in terms of the pairing with the female leads and the depth of the plot.",The Best of Me

Even though I was very upset about how it ended after everything Amanda and Dawson had gone through. From being together even after their struggles with family and then losing each other, but then finding each other again, and then losing each other again. It was very difficult for my mom and I to keep our emotions in check. We both couldn't stop crying. But we are both very empathetic people, so I wouldn't expect anything less. It was still a great movie! I love the two main actors and it was great seeing some new actors on screen as well. I have never felt so touched and compelled by a story as much as The Best of Me from Nicholas Sparks! I feel that his books are usually about Life, Love, and Loss.

I thought the casting of young Dawson wasn't good, young Dawson doesn't resemble older Dawson because usually when movies depict younger and older version of the main character they at least slightly resemble the main character but this one didn't. Also it was really predictable I was telling my girlfriend what was going to happen before it happened and I'm was right 99.9% of the time.

(slight spoil alert),8,28 October 2014,"After an explosion at his oil rig, Dawson, played by James Marsden, was thrown into the cold ridged water and as he laid there for over four hours. While there he had a brief glimpse of the teenage girl he was once in love with. That first loves name was Amanda (Michelle Monaghan). She was at her home with her alcohol husband and teenage son. Then when sad news of their old friend Tuck (Gerald McRaney) passed away, Dawson and Amanda are reunited and assigned them to spread Tuck's ashes. Tuck also wanted them to figure out their problems with the past and ghosts they have yet to deal with.This film was based off of the Nicholas Sparks book by the same name. I personally did not read the book, so I didn't know if the book was better than the movie or not. The movie to me was very moving, and also very heartwarming. The younger characters of Dawson Amanda, played by Luke Bracey and Liana Liberato were very spot on. They portrait the love that both versions of Dawson and Amanda had for each other.Younger Dawson and older Dawson stayed the same. He was very innocent and had charm to him. While younger Amanda and older Amanda were very different. Younger Amanda is very bubbly and pretty, doesn't sit in the corner. Whereas older Amanda is more uptight and just settling for life. The part of Tuck, was absolutely incredible in my eyes. He took in this kid who had the worst childhood you could ever imagine and gave him a second chance and watched out for him.The Best of Me to some people would be ""just another Nicholas Sparks movie"" but to me.

There is always rain, water, a letter of some sort, cancer, Daddy disapproves of the boyfriend, etc etc. I could see the ending coming like a very very slow train.

I read the book and I feel it lived up to those expectations and more. I normally always say the book is better, but in this case it is a tie. I love reading better but this movie is amazing. I loved the constant flashbacks. It really gave more insight into the couple's story. Dawnson's family background is portrayed so amazingly realistic that it is almost hard to watch. James does well playing older Dawnson. Plus he's just beautiful to look at. I loved the actor they chose for young Amanda. She was so good and she actually look a lot like older Amanda. She was very cute and pretty. Perfect for the part. The only problem I have was that older Dawnson and the younger version looked nothing alike. But afterwords, I came to find out that the late Paul Walker was supposed to play Dawnson. That makes a whole lot more sense with the casting. I love James and I think he did a fabulous job, but I think the casting should have at least tried to find someone similar to younger Dawnson. It was sloppy on their part. Seemed as if they were so upset with his passing that they just picked any good looking guy to fill in for him. If you hate tragic endings and romances than this is not your movie. I'm not even sure why you're rating this or watching it if you hate sappy Nicholas Sparks love stories. The ending will kill you but it is done so wonderfully that it leaves you crying and smiling at the same time. I will be reading and watching this again. Well done.",The Best of Me

153,crazy_chris-91917,Just so disappointingly 'middle of the road',5,23 August 2015,"The Best of Me is simply 'middle of the road'. It's a film boasting with beautiful set pieces and cinematography, but seriously lacking in personality and story. It's a film that manages to hit the cheesiness without being downright sickening, and also a film that suffers from identity crisis. Comparatively, 'The Best of Me' and 'The Notebook' are pretty much the same film, but the former fails to hit the emotional strings the way the latter does. Strangely enough, the tone of the film is far more depressing than The Notebook, but to the point where it is almost suffocating. This was ruined by the main protagonists persona's...I wanted to like these characters, but they were frustratingly stuck in monotone even as the story develops. For the most part I found them very difficult to connect with emotionally and sympathetically, and given the series of events that occur during the film, this is bad. Main man Dawson is a typical nice-guy with a troubled past and finds it impossible to see the positives in life. Damsel Amanda is borderline annoying, but at least she seems remotely human. The cast do a decent job portraying these characters, but still these nitpicks do bother me.The plot also runs very monotone, it feels as if it goes nowhere. While there are a couple of stand out scenes (which are actually very good), the plot occasionally hits some serious goofs. Especially towards the end. The stunning set pieces often help the snoozier sections, Director Michael Hoffman manages to pull the visuals off very nicely.To cut this short, The Best of Me is technically harmless. It is a watchable but also a painfully middle of the road romance film. I was left constantly hoping for something to surprise me, and whilst one scene did impress, it simply wasn't enough. If you're into something a bit more melodramatic and soppy then I'd say it's worth a watch, otherwise you're probably best giving this a miss.",The Best of Me
154,tayf-80413,Fantastic!,9,14 September 2015,"The Best of Me is a romantic drama that will bring you on an emotional roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. The movie is based on one of Nicholas Sparks' famous novels. I believe the movie followed the book very well in the storyline of the novel and its descriptions. The Best of Me did not portray to me as a typical love story written by Nicholas Sparks. The reason for this is that The Best of Me is about giving two middle aged people a second chance at the love they once had rather than in many of his novel like, A Walk to Remember, where two teenagers hopelessly fall in love. For me, I personally liked the different emotions expressed throughout the film. One minute the movie had me crying, the next minute I could be laughing. The actress Michelle Monaghan, playing Amanda and the actor James Marsden, playing Dawson were able to enthrall the audience with their emotions. I think both of these actors resembled the characters' characteristics in the novel. My favorite part about the movie was that the unexpected always occurred when you least expected it. My one and only criticism for The Best of Me was the ending. The ending doesn't leave you with satisfaction, it leaves you with wanting to know more about the storyline and the characters. The ending is very tragic and ends in a way that leaves you speechless. If you are not one to like sad, emotional movies I do not recommend this. I believe the ending of the movie was a result of fate while other viewers may have depicted it as a coincidence. Another criticism someone might have is how the movie often was set in the past and switched back and forth between that and the present. I personally did not find it difficult to follow but I understand if someone found it confusing. I highly recommend The Best of Me if you are interested in a waterworks romantic drama.",The Best of Me

156,ariannar-89112,well produced movie.,10,5 May 2016,"Arianna Roberts This week's featured film pick is a heartfelt, award winning movie from North Carolina that was brought to me by recommendations. Mixing emotional flashbacks with the fateful present, The Best of Me is one of the most romantic, heart opening movies I have ever came across. The movie ""The Best of Me"" was produced in 2014 by Relativity Media industry and is based on the book which was written by Nicholas Sparks. The best of me is based on two teenagers, Dawson and Amanda, whom fall in love but part their ways soon after. Approximately 20 years later Dawson and Amanda get set up by Dawson's guardian growing up, Tuck, and the two start to rekindle their love. The flashbacks that happen in The Best of Me brings the whole movie together with the emphasis on how deep their love was for each other. The dialogue also shows their love but also their problems they were faced with that they were challenged to overcome. The theme of fate and destiny was strongly put together within this movie. Amanda and Dawson's love was too strong for them to not be brought back together for another chance. The rejoicement of Amanda and Dawson was meant to happen and told them that it really was meant to be. Destiny is defined as ""events that will necessarily happen to a particular person or thing in the future"". Tuck bringing Dawson and Amanda back together was destiny, It showed them both how they were wasting their time and they both confessed how they have always, and will always, love each other. This movie was a very good representation of fate and destiny. The Best of Me was beautifully made and put together well. This movie really did get to the best of me!

However, I just watched this movie again today on TV & it has a totally different ending. He does not die and they walk off into the sunset together.
