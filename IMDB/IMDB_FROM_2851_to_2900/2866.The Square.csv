0,SnoopyStyle,way long but good character study,7,10 September 2018,"American reporter Anne (Elisabeth Moss) interviews Christian (Claes Bang), the curator of an avantgarde modern art museum in Stockholm. His phone and his wallet get stolen by a crew of pickpockets. His assistant Michael helps track the phone and suggests sending threatening letters to all the apartments within the phone's location. Christian does it and faces unexpected consequences.The scheme is actually quite clever and it works in the movie. Christian is very frustrating in the politically correct way. He is off-putting but that's the point. He could easily fix the problem with the kid but he's too scared of him. It would be more understandable if the kid is a teenager. It's silly and shows his lack of a backbone. There are a couple of amazing scenes and there are quite a few filler scenes in two and a half hours. It definitely could be cut down to two hours. The Tourette's scene is fun. Moss has a couple of great scenes and she's the best actor in the movie. This is not a movie to root for the guy but also not to root against him. It's not really a comedy or that intense as a drama. It's a movie of frustration at all of his fallibilities. It is great at painting a picture of a man trying to be good but lacks the courage to be truly good when backed into a corner.",The Square
1,Horst_In_Translation,The art of make-believe,6,7 November 2017,"""The Square"" is an English- and Swedish-language film from this year (2017), so a very new and fresh release that already managed some nice awards recognition, especially at Cannes, and a lot more will probably follow. The writer and director is Ruben Östlund and this is his most recent work. With ""Turist"", he came close to an Oscar nomination (there is a funny video on Youtube when we see the director's live reaction to his film missing out) and this one here could very well break the spell this time as it is Sweden's official submission and considered among the front runners at this point. This also has to do with the film including 2 very familiar faces from American small screen entertainment, namely Elisabeth Moss (The West Wing, Mad Men, The Handmaid's Tale, Top of the Lake) and Dominic West (The Wire, The Affair). They may be credited second and third, but they don't really have a whole lot of screen time, especially West who has almost zero dialogue, even if his two scenes are among the most memorable from this pretty long film. Comfortably crosses the 2-hour mark. The film in its entirety is really about Danish actor Claes Bang's main character, who is really in each and every scene playing a guy who runs a museum that is about to open a new exhibition.And this exhibition is what I am referring to in the title of my review as it is an empty square and it is just the people stepping on it that make an impact. The announcement of this exhibition coming at the same time as the protagonist's notice of cancellation was among the very best moments because it showed how the outrage ends immediately through the pretense of an artistic value, even if you blow up little children. It is a great satire indeed and there were many other moments putting a question mark behind what can or should be considered artistic merit. The obvious one is of course the cleaning guy. But the film also delivers in the area of humanity as it sets the pretentious world of artistry against the desperate world of beggars, the lowest layer of society. The boy badly wanting the main character's excuse is the best example. Actually I had a feeling he or even the protagonist could end up falling down into the square shown to us from up there down into the stairwell in an equivalent to the staged explosion in the square. But I was wrong.This was a really deep film and I am sure you will find something new every time you watch it. Maybe it is a bit clumsy here and there, but I still think Östlund had strong vision, focus and execution here. I really liked the parallel with the car in front of the poor people's house there between early on when the two men don't want to leave the vehicle and near the very end when everybody wants to get out and doesn't mind the surroundings. There and maybe on one or two other occasions, Östlund missed the right moment to finish the film. I myself certainly could have done without the very last scene inside the house with the tenant as it added almost nothing to me. But that's all subjective of course. Another thing I liked was the soundtrack, subtle yet memorable. I am not really sure if this film is one that will appeal to the Academy, but we shall see. A nomination wouldn't be undeserving and I think these almost 150 minutes also have a decent contemporary relevance to them. It's not a movie that is really more effective on the big screen than on a TV screen, but I think it deserves to be seen. I give it a thumbs-up and suggest you check it out.",The Square
2,kosmasp,Don't be a square,8,12 May 2021,"Society can be difficult to portray in film. Or it is quite easy to fall back on cliches. Not that this movie doesn't ... but it also has a lot to say. The movie follows someone who is or at least seems to be above other individuals. Someone flawed, someone privileged and someone you either look up to or think is detached from life.There is too much here to unpack everything and there are many things that can be analyzed (some even taken apart). The poster and the picture seen here on imdb is from a very powerful scene towards the end of the movie. Analogies and all that ... it starts off fun and gets out of hand quickly. And is just one of the showcases of the movie - it's ability to make you question motivation and maybe even be on the ""wrong"" side (morally speaking) of an argument or beef between individuals or groups.The dialog is quite unique and there is even one powerful love scene (which I didn't expect to see in a movie like this) ... especially powerful considering it involves an american actor. And one that will ""haunt"" both characters for the rest of the movie. Feelings/detachment and all the things you'd expect from it.What should we do or think when others annoy us? It's not easy to stay level headed ... nowadays one might say it is actually one of the toughest things to do (with everyone being triggered by one thing or another). And all the while this disguises itself in the form of art ...",The Square
3,lee_eisenberg,stereotypically Scandinavian,5,26 December 2018,"If you only see the poster of Ruben Östlund's Academy Award-nominated movie ""The Square"", you might think that it's an action flick. It's actually a drama calling into question the issue of what constitutes art, and also addresses ethical issues. The most recognizable cast member is Elisabeth Moss of ""The Handmaid's Tale"". However, it's one of the most stereotypically Scandinavian movies that I've ever seen: deliberately slow-moving. There are long spells where little happens. It's good in the sense of concentrating on the question of altruism and the protagonist's shortcomings, but it really tests your attention span. I only recommend it if you're into art-house movies.",The Square
4,jboothmillard,The Square,7,26 July 2020,"I think I saw this Swedish-based movie talked about on The Film Review on BBC News, I knew it was something to do with art, and I recognised the leading actress, so I was more than happy to watch it. Basically, Christian (Dracula's Claes Bang) is the curator of the X-Royal art museum in Stockholm, formerly the Royal Palace. He is interviewed by the journalist Anne (The Handmaid's Tale's Elisabeth Moss), struggling to explain museum jargon. Later, after a confrontation in a pedestrian zone, Christian notices that his smartphone and wallet are missing, presumably stolen. He and his assistant Michael (Christopher Læssø) to track the position of his phone on his computer, it is traced to a large apartment block. They write a threatening anonymous letter demanding the return of the phone and wallet by depositing them at a nearby 7-Eleven. Christian posts a copy of the letter in each apartment mailbox during the night. Several days later, a package for Christian is deposited at the store, it contains the phone and the wallet with everything intact. Christian is in good spirits and goes to a party where he is reunited with Anne, and they go back to her apartment to have sex. Anne offers to throw away his used condom, but he refuses to hand it over to her. They argue over the situation, as she believes he does not trust her to dispose of the semen rather than take it. Several days later, Anne meets Christian in the museum and tells him she is looking for more than casual sex. She asks him if he feels the same, but he is evasive. When Anne tries calling him later, he does not answer the phone. The day after getting his phone and wallet back, Christian is informed there is a second package for him at the 7-Eleven. Suspicious, he sends Michael to pick it up. There, Michael is confronted by an angry young Arab boy (Elijandro Edouard) whose parents believe that he is a thief because of the letter and demands that Christian apologise. The boy threatens to create ""chaos"" for Christian if he does not do so. Later, the boy visits Christian's home and confronts him on the staircase. Christian tries to send him away, but the boy knocks on various door screaming for help. After the boy falls down the stairs, Christian hears him calling for help, though no one comes to help. Disturbed, Christian finds a number to call the boy, but fails to contact him, but he records an apology video message. Meanwhile, Christian must manage the promotion of a new exhibition, centred on an art piece called The Square by Lola Arias. It is described in the artist's statement: ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" The advertising agency commissioned by the museum to promote The Square states that they need to harness social media attention with something other than the uncontroversial and bland artist's statement. One night, a fancy dinner is hosted at the museum, where guests experience a live art performance, with a half-naked man (Terry Notary) acting like an ape. During the tense performance, the guest stay still as if he was a real live animal, as he barks at them, singles out audience members, including Julian (Dominic West), tossing and jump on the furniture, smashing plates and generally intimidating people. This performance eventually ends when the performer's aggressive behaviour causes guests to pin him down. The advertising agency representatives develop a promotional clip for The Square project, contradicting its message, showing an impoverished white blond girl entering The Square and being killed in an explosion. The violent video is published on the museum's website and YouTube channel after a distracted Christian gives his approval without viewing it. The clip goes viral, quickly reaching 300,000 views, but receives an extremely hostile response from the media, religious leaders, and the public. A press conference is arranged by the museum, where Christian apologises for the controversy and announces he is stepping down as curator in mutual agreement with the board. Several journalists then attack him for stirring up cheap controversy with a tasteless clip, while others attack him for self-censorship because of his resignation. Feeling guilty about what he put the boy through, Christian returns to the apartment block some time later and tries to find him and his family. Christian talks to a neighbour who tells him the boy and his family have moved away. Bang gives a great performance as the art gallery owner with troubles, Moss and West make good short appearances, and stunt performer/choreographer is highly memorable as the performance artist who goes ape. You could argue that the ape dinner sequence is the one that stands out, but the rest of the film is inventive, with interesting insights into the art world, social media, advertising and political correctness, maybe the slightest bit long, but overall a worthwhile satirical comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!",The Square
5,writers_reign,Pi R Squared,5,10 April 2018,"This is the kind of movie that has the Academic-Pseud axis creaming in their pants. Reason: It's something you can agonise about, tease new meanings from ad infinitum. A dozen pseuds could offer a dozen 'meanings' and they'd all be right. It's about everything and nothing. It's comedy, it's satire, it's the Black And White Minstrels in drag. Sepia ourself. It's whatever you WANT it to be, Tristan. Eat your heart out, Joe Wright, this has 'festival circuit' written all over it and writ large.

6,evanston_dad,A Fractured Prism of Our Times,10,26 February 2018,"""The Square"" is a leisurely, meandering film, and it's packed full of ideas. It might be a bit too meandering for some, but I found myself fascinated by pretty much everything in it.Watching this film recreated the feeling of sitting with a bunch of progressive liberal friends over a glass of wine and engaging in a bunch of ""what if"" scenarios. What if we're not as progressive as we like to think we are? What if freedom of expression causes harm to others? What if in the process of trying to right one wrong I commit another? All of these questions are asked in ""The Square,"" and none of them are answered. These questions don't really have answers, and the film is content to craft vignettes that explore how some of these scenarios might play out, largely without editorials or judgements. If that sounds appealing to you you will probably like this film. If not, then well probably not.Claes Bang gives one of the performances of the year as a museum curator whose personal life distracts him from his job and who gives the green light on a provocative ad campaign for a new installation that causes a public outrcy. But this is only a little bit of what the film as a whole is about. What it's about more than anything is the fine line that separates us all from our savage instincts, no matter how civilized and cultivated we'd like to think we are. In a film full of cringey moments, that point is most effectively made in the film's cringiest, during a dinner for the museum's mucky mucks at which a bit of performance art gets out of hand and a bunch of people who value artistic freedom above all else must decide where the line between art and sociopathic behavior is drawn. The scene is nearly unbearable, but it expertly takes jabs at a type of intellectual elite who gives a lot of lip service to correcting the wrongs of the world but when it comes right down to it causes more problems than he solves.Fans of Elizabeth Moss will be pleased to hear that she has a supporting role in this film and gives quite a good performance as a one-night stand who expects more from a relationship than her partner wants to give. That this character owns a monkey that wanders around her apartment and goes completely unremarked upon gives you a taste of the overall weirdness of this film.One of the year's best, and it deserves to win the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award for which it is nominated.Grade: A+",The Square
7,deloudelouvain,"Not that good, overrated movie",4,6 November 2018,"The Square is just overrated on here, it doesn't deserve such a high rating compared to other also strange but good movies. The Square is a bit weird, and that's the focal point as I think they wanted to attract the audience's attention by being controversed and shoking, but in the end it's just all too long and not that interesting to watch. The acting was okay though, nothing bad about the cast, it's just the story that is not that interesting. For the humor part, which was not that present, I had a couple mild smiles but that was about it.",The Square
8,namashi_1,"Stunning, Uncomfortable & Sad!",9,22 February 2018,"Written and Directed by Ruben Östlund, 'The Square' digs deep into the human-world & artistry, and gives us a scrambled portrait of the world we live in. This is a story about art, made by artists, who are humans, who unlike their art, are fragile & fatally flawed. This is a Stunning, Uncomfortable & Sad film, that very rightly has earned its Nomination at the Academy-Awards this year for Best Foreign Language Film.The Square' Synopsis: A prestigious Stockholm museum's chief art curator finds himself in times of both professional and personal crisis as he attempts to set up a controversial new exhibit.Ruben Östlund is a filmmaker to reckon with. 'The Square' isn't an easy film to watch or comprehend. This is a film that doesn't spoon-feed you, its treated like a docu-drama about these people behind a museum, whose life are as fragile as it can get. Östlund's 'The Square' asks you to feel & understand on your own, and unapologetically asks you the truth behind art & the artists behind it. It digs deep, and whenever you laugh here, you laugh until it begins to hurt.Östlund's Writing may not appeal to the average cinegoer who's pleased with superheroes flying around beating the bad-guys or even to those who like dramas that use dialogue to explain every detail. This is for the elite, thinking audience who are ready to surrender to the man's vision, that, if understood correctly, is much more than selling tickets or applauds. Östlund's Direction is remarkable too. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design are done to perfection. The Score also is completely seductive. The Performances are spell-binding. Claes Bang, Elisabeth Moss, Dominic West, Terry Notary & Christopher Læssø, all are magnificent. On the whole, 'The Square' requires patience, but once you get in, there's no going back. Take a dip now.",The Square
9,lasttimeisaw,"a sharp-tongued, rapier-like caricature aiming at our society",8,18 November 2017,"2017's Palme d'or winner, Swedish absurdist Ruben Östlund's social satire taps into the life of Christian (Bang), the curator of an art museum in Stockholm, which will descend into a tailspin after his wallet and smartphone is stolen en route to work one day by a confidence trick. A significant step-up from his uppity marital disintegration inspection FORCE MAJEURE (2014), In THE SQUARE, Östlund has learned how to let his hair down with more brio and conceal moral condescendence among his sarcastic skits, which makes for a piquant contemporary comedy doesn't flinch from touching many a raw nerve among audience, anyway, the joke is on all of us because there are something undeniably unsavory residing within every and each human soul, we can laugh about it, but more often than not, a twinge of self-awareness synchronously pulsates. ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" it is a motto from the museum's latest exhibition, whose titular installation supersedes an august bronze statue in the opening (with droll maladroitness setting the keynote of the film), but can its underlying altruism transcend from artistic cant into something concrete in reality? Christian's story will give us a wry answer. A seemingly harmless plan (although Christian must deign to actualize it) to retrieve his stolen phone actually works, but before Christian's euphoria subsides, it boomerangs. It only takes a sincere apologize and some explanation to mend the fences, which eventually deteriorates into uncanny paranoia and insidious physical affliction towards a minor is implied, in-congruent with the rest of the film's farcical tenor, but it tests the boundary of how far THE SQUARE is willing to push the buttons, and Östlund shows judicious concerns about what is shown on the screen in slightly gnawing execution, and no easy recompense is dished up in the end. Elsewhere, jokes are in full swing, starting from the opening interview of Christian from an American journalist Anne (Moss) about the gobbledygook on the museum's internet, to a faux pas caused by a Tourette's syndrome patient, and the ludicrous tug-of-war in Anne and Christian's one-night-stand, apparently with a chimpanzee in the next room, until the dreadful irony in our click-bait media publicity with controversial, eyeball-grabbing gimmick, and a painful realization that it often works. However, the central piece, of course belongs to the hyped (which is on the film's main poster) performance art of an ape-man radically terrorizing the entire guests of a banquet to a bitter end, motion-capture stuntman Terry Notary totally owns the one-off opportunity in the central stage to redefine primate mimicking and debunk how similarly animalistic we are underneath all the finery exterior, notwithstanding the whole act partakes of a well- orchestrated trick for the sake of scandalization. A late-bloomer Claes Bang is perfectly apt in inhabiting Christian's towering figure, dapper mien and jaunty disposition, oozing disarming charisma which veils his self-seeking nature to a degree we even tend to give excuses to him involuntarily (that boy is tenacious and annoying, how on earth his staff could upload that inappropriate video onto their public website without his imprimatur?), and in the gender politics spar with a gutsy Elisabeth Moss (although her part is shamefully peripheral, and her defense of ""it takes two to tango"" accusation is too feeble to register), which fortuitously hits the hot-button with the current power-abuse cleansing pandemic. Forsaking a traditional score in favor of a cappella passages to heave the story's emotional shift, THE SQUARE is a sharp-tongued, rapier-like caricature aiming at a society characterized by class- discrepancy (beggars galore in one of the richest country in the world is a disheartening antimony), patriarchy and apathy, redolent of a visceral tang of self-reflexive mockery with a knowing wink, that is the power of THE SQUARE.",The Square
10,Hellmant,"Some pretty insightful commentary on modern art, including what makes art art!",9,1 February 2018,"'THE SQUARE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A Swedish satirical drama about a contemporary art installation, and the extreme publicity surrounding it. The idea for the film was inspired by an actual art installation created by the director, Ruben Östlund, and producer Kalle Boman. Östlund (who also helmed the 2014 critical darling 'FORCE MAJEURE') wrote the screenplay as well. The film stars Claes Bang, Elisabeth Moss, Dominic West, Terry Notary and Christopher Laesso. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it won the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. It's also won (or been nominated for) multiple other prestigious awards too (including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film). I found it to be extremely insightful and bizarrely fascinating. The film tells the story of an art museum curator, in Stockholm, named Christian (Bang). Christian is currently managing the promotion for an art exhibit focusing on a piece called 'The Square'. The add agency executives in charge of the promotion, for the exhibit, want to create controversy through social media, and it works (excessively so). At the same time Christian starts a sexual relationship with a woman that interviewed him, named Anne (Moss), and she becomes confrontational about their relationship very quickly. He's also mugged on the street, and then comes up with an elaborate plan to get his possessions back, which ultimately creates even more trouble for him. The whole time the movie also focuses on the bizarre art included in Christian's museum. The film has some pretty insightful commentary on modern art, including what makes art art, and society's reaction to it. It also has some pretty interesting commentary on modern society in general, and the different power dynamics, as well as relationships, between different classes of people. Bang is excellent in the lead role, playing the most rational and relatable character in the film, who's seemingly surrounded by all quirky and mentally unstable people. I love movies like this, and it's definitely the type of film you could repeatedly watch in order to get more and more out of it. It deserves it's Oscar buzz in my opinion.",The Square
11,StrictlyConfidential,"A Lousy, Narrow-Minded Guilt Trip",1,23 July 2018,"Shame! Shame! Shame! on ""The Square"" for its incessantly gabby bullshit and for the guilt-trip that it tried to lay on any viewer who wasn't a homeless person.Being a non-homeless person, myself - I lived in Vancouver's Strathcona neighborhood for a number of years (which is right next door to Skid-Row Capital) - And, at that time, I saw 2 beautiful buildings go up in that area that were specifically meant to house the homeless.Well - Within 6 months both of these buildings were an utter mess of litter, filth, and excrement. And the reason why this was so was because the homeless don't give a damn about anything, and they don't respect anything, or anybody.These people, who are always screaming for their rights, want the rest of society to always be cleaning up after them and always taking care of them. They refuse to take responsibility for anything in their lives (though they are quite capable of doing so).And, so - With that in mind - I refuse to have some narrow-minded, little movie, like ""The Square"", lay its bullshit guilt-trip on me.",The Square
12,paul2001sw-1,Art and empathy,8,14 June 2020,"Ruben Ostland's 'The Square' is a vicious satire on the Stockholm art world, and on upper middle class society more generally. We see art, designed to spark a debate, but no-one seems to believe in anything; with a uniform absence of empathy, characters speak but do not communicate. The protagonist is not exactly a bad person, but he's not really fit for any worthwhile purpose, although the sometimes surreal events that happen around him might disorient even someone with a better moral compass. The film is consistently clever, even if it's setting up it's own targets; the a capella soundtrack adds nicely to the discomfitting mood.",The Square
13,nairtejas,Molecule Review: The Square,5,12 June 2018,"Claes Bang is charming in this satirical commentary on the state of freedom of expression and politics in the Swedish art museum scene which depends on shoots of massively appealing sequences but falls flat when you see them as a whole. Director Ruben Ostlund uses the narrative story of a man (Bang) in the upper strata of society who has to brave the world as he doesn't know it. Starting from the loss of his wallet and phone to the uphill task of managing the museum of which he is a director, he fails to use his intelligence or charm and ends up facing the wrath of the merciless collective world. I am not sure what more Ostlund tries to say here but his primary theme of how far freedom of speech can go and who is supposed to cap it is loud and clear throughout The Square. Elizabeth Moss also stars in this sleek little abstract film that has some great music (Justice, for instance) and enjoyable shots of people enjoying themselves. Special nod to whoever designed the sets and the costumes of the characters because now I want to dress like Bang. The sex scene between two characters is one of the most natural thing I have seen all year in film, which is why I should stress that The Square has some extraordinary sequences for you to enjoy, but as a whole it still is an overlong mess.

14,eddie_baggins,An over-long epic that outstays its welcome,4,14 August 2018,"Winning last year's Canne's Film Festival coveted Palme d'Or prize and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated for Best Foreign Film at this year's awards season, Ruben Östlund's Swedish set The Square certainly comes to home release with some prestige attached to it but this bum-numbing epic that acts as a darkly humorous expose of modern art culture and more broadly an examination of humankind in general, is the type of film that will split viewers down the middle in regards to love and hate.Following on from his critically acclaimed Force Majeure from 2014, Östlund continues on with his slowly paced and methodical way of story-telling as we here follow Claes Bang's art gallery curator Christian through what feels like a collection of mini-films within the larger whole as the all of a sudden under duress big-shot finds his life hitting a few roadblocks in the lead up to his gallery's opening of an exhibition known as The Square.It's a seemingly simplistic set-up but Östlund's execution is anything but, as Christian's journey entails awkward romantic encounters with Elizabeth Moss's American Anne, a crayon carrying chimp, an extremely abnormal dinner function, an angry child and a viral video that is a catalyst to much of Christian's woes.These occurrences all add up to a whole that combines to create an almost unnerving atmosphere and tone but they don't gel to create a cohesive narrative that feels all that apparent and while many will find messages and themes that are possibly there and possibly not there, it feels like The Square squanders some chances to be a genuinely effective dark comedy/expose as it gets lost in an abundance of over-long and over-wrought scenes that needed a much tighter edit.One aspect of the film that can't be faulted however is Östlund's cast commitment to the cause with everyone giving it their all, with Bang and Moss in particular impressing in their roles, while the films few definitively laugh out loud scenes such as disrupted Q and A and the aforementioned dinner feel like scenes out of a much more well-rounded and engaging film.Final Say - An over-long and overall bloated arthouse offering, The Square has some nice ideas and potentially relevant messages but it's hard for them too shine through when the film around them is such a hard slog to endure.2 viral videos out of 5",The Square
15,howard.schumann,Skewers the hypocrisy of the contemporary art museum world in Stockholm,8,22 November 2017,"According to Swedish director Ruben Östlund (""Force Majeure""), society today has turned its back on the social contract, the obligation that people not only express their concerns for other's well-being but act upon them in concrete and meaningful ways. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Östlund's latest film, The Square, mercilessly skewers the moral hypocrisy of the contemporary art museum world in Stockholm, particularly taking aim at Christian (Claes Bang), the museum's chief curator whose pretensions are repeatedly called to task in creative and sometimes bizarre ways during the two hour and twenty minute film. Christian's current project is to develop marketing for an exhibition that features a piece of artwork called ""The Square,"" a 13 x 13 foot illuminated space that seeks to create the possibility for people to bridge the gap between the ideals they hold and the way they actually behave. It is adorned by a plaque that reads, ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" What this basically translates to is that anyone standing inside the square is afforded whatever help that they ask for from passersby, whether it involves money or just physical or emotional help.Christian is ""likeable enough,"" but if the definition of hypocrisy is ""the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which ones own behavior does not conform, he is a walking example. The film begins with the curator being interviewed by personable journalist Anne (Elisabeth Moss, ""Mad Men,"" TV series) about his upcoming art project. It all goes well until Christian is asked to explain the meaning of the convoluted phrase, ""the topos of exhibition/non-exhibition."" His inability to do so in a coherent manner unmasks his artier-than-thou façade and the interview begins to go off the rails.Later on the street, Christian's insecurity is reinforced when, after intervening to help a woman screaming that a man is trying to kill her, he is played for a sucker by con artists who rob him of his wallet, cell phone, and cufflinks. Using GPS to track his cell phone to an apartment building in a seedy part of town, he is persuaded by his assistant, Michael (Christopher Læssø, ""Follow the Money,"" TV series), to print threatening letters and drop them into each person's mailbox with the address of a place to return the stolen goods. While this tactic eventually leads to the return of his materials, not having foreseen any consequences that might affect someone else, he is forced to deal with a super irate young man (Elijandro Edouard) who is persistent in demanding an apology from Christian who stonewalls the boy until he no longer can.All of this sounds dark, but Östlund's comic genius lifts the film to a truly innovative level with an abundance (perhaps an overabundance) of impressive set pieces. There is the homeless woman who brazenly asks Christian to buy her a Chicken Ciabatta sandwich without onions. The curator, who only wants to help, reacts testily by buying her the sandwich but tells her to pick out the onions herself. In another sequence, a member of the audience with Tourette's syndrome keeps interrupting a museum Q&A presentation by the artist Julian (Dominic West, ""Money Monster""), calling out obscene remarks directed towards the female host.There is more. A fellow worker insists on bringing a crying baby to every meeting; a tug of war erupts over what to do with a used condom after Christian and Anne have sex together in her room (much to the chagrin of Anne's Chimpanzee roommate); an ill-advised ad campaign promoting the new project showing a young girl being blown to bits inside the square goes viral which forces some changes in the museum's personnel; museum donors rush toward a complementary buffet before the chef even finishes describing what's being offered. The centerpiece of the film, however, involves Oleg (Terry Notary, ""Kong: Skull Island""), a performance artist who does more than his share of frightening the attendees at a ball thrown for the museum's well-heeled donors.Oleg acts the part of an aggressive ape, grunting and screeching while mercilessly hunting its prey. The donors sit transfixed, protecting themselves while ignoring Oleg who jumps on tables, pulls people's hair, and eventually assaults a woman until several men pounce on the aggressor, unleashing their most repressed form of violence. It is a scene that ranges from curious to funny to threatening to violent to just plain sad. While Östlund should be acknowledged for attempting to tackle an issue that has relevance for our times, the film's message that an inordinate attachment to individualism and, what the director calls ""The Bystander Effect,"" threatens our ability to connect with others, is a comfortable illusion, a symbol of our malaise, not the cause. What is more significant is the prevailing assumption of our culture that we are separate, disconnected human beings living in a random, indifferent, and deterministic universe. As Christian philosopher and priest Thomas Berry puts it, ""The world about us has become an ""it"" rather than a ""thou."" In The Square, the repetitive inclusion of Bach/Gounod's beautiful Ave Maria suggests, however, that Östlund appreciates the fact that we may not be able to understand the needs and wants of others until we can awaken from the dream of a separate self to the truth of who we really are.",The Square
16,imseeg,Who can you trust? Very intelligent morality tale about trust. Best suited for the arthouse audiences. Others might find it boring.,9,22 September 2018,"The story is about an art director who is pondering over an ad to promote a rather boring museum exhibition. This beginning of the story may sound boring. It is. And it isnt. Nothing is what it seems in this movie. Not even the trailer will make you understand what to expect of this confusing movie. Mind provoking, but only IF you like to use your brain while watching movies. I would confidently dare to state that this movie is definitely NOT suited for the masses. Only the (very hardened) arthouse movie viewer will be able to really adore this gem.How can I best explain to you the very intellingent and pleasant weirdness of this movie? Maybe how I can best describe it is by telling you that this director has got the talent to portray everyday thoughts and feelings with such accurate detail that it becomes simultaneously painful and very funny to watch. Forgetting to pick up the kids from school, after which the kids get angry at the parent, sounds like a very cliche and boring scene. But the way in which such a scene is directed, gives me as a viewer the suggestion that there is something more going on, that isnt revealed. What? It is left open. But a lot of things get suggested. Does the father neglect his kids? Are the kids mentally ill? We dont know, but the suspicion is tangible.This guessing about other ones hidden motives is a constant in this movie. Can I trust another person? How can I know for sure? Only a few Imdb reviewers mentioned this theme of trust, even though it is explicitly mentioned in the movie. Trust is also a central theme in the magnificent movie ""Turist"", made by the same director, in which a man flees when he sees an avalanche approaching, without first taking care of his wife and kids. The trust issues that the woman has to deal with after they all survive the avalanche, almost breaks up their marriage. What if the person you are most intimate with, suddenly doesnt care for you when you are most in need? How do you know for sure, that your husband or wife will be there for you, when you are most in need?When a director hasgot the talent to turn the most ordinary, everyday feelings into something very tangible and suspenseful, then he has got me sitting at the edge of my seat. This movie consists for 2 and a half hour long of nothing else but mondane, everyday routines like board meetings, dinner parties, museum exhibits. This may sound boring, but it aint. I will guarantee all you arthouse afficionados, that this movie will rock your boat in a way you havent witnessed before. Cant reveal spoilers here.A very deserved first prize from the Cannes film festival jury. Very original story. Very meaningful too, for those who like to use their brains while watching. Terrific photography and a gorgeous use of the soundtrack. This is pure cinematography! A breath of fresh air in the world of movies. If you like this one be sure to check out ""Turist"" and ""Play"" from the same director. This director has got a magic touch. Brilliant!",The Square
17,paul-allaer,"More on the ""human condition"" from director Ruben Östlund",8,17 November 2017,"""The Square"" (2017 release from Sweden; 142 min.) brings the story of Christian, the chief curator of a Swedish museum. As the movie opens, he is interviewed by Anna, an American journalist. Afterwards, as he is walking outside, a woman runs up to him screaming ""help me! He's going to kill me"". Christian and another bystander are bale to fend off the apparent enraged boyfriend. After the tumult, Christian realizes his wallet and mobile were stolen, but with the help of a staff member, he can track down the cell phone's location. Meanwhile the museum is starting an ambitious new project called The Square, a 12x12 ft. square meant to be a ""sanctuary of trust and care"". The museum staff is thinking of ways to publicize the new project. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Ruben Östlund, whose previous film, the outstanding ""Force Majeure"", was a major surprise in 2014 in the best possible way. Here the director again examines the human condition and how people react to situations they did not expect. In that sense, ""The Square"" is entirely in line with ""Force Majeure"", although it is also clear that for ""The Square"" the ambitions were put on steroids. One of the beauties of the film is that Östlund lets entire scenes play out without feeling the need to change camera angles or other editing tricks. Love it, love it, love it. Beware, there definitely are a number of scenes that may make you feel uncomfortable (as I'm sure the director intended to make you feel), but overall I felt bedazzled by it all. Danish actor Claes Bang (who keeps reminding me of Pierce Brosnan) plays the role of Christian with fervor, but in my book Terry Holland (playing the actor as the chimp, in the pivotal scene of the movie) steals the show. That scene alone is worth seeing the movie. Mustn't say more.""The Square"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and promptly won the Palm d'Or, the festival's top price. It finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended OK but not great (looked to be about 10-15 people in total), which is unfortunate. Maybe strong word-of-mouth will help improve attendance. If you are interested in the ""human condition"", or loved ""Force Majeure"", you are in for a treat. I encourage you to check out ""The Square"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Square
18,myriamlenys,intriguing but distant,7,12 September 2018,"To begin with the good : this is quite an interesting movie, which has intelligent things to say about life in our modern Western cities, with their ever more distant extremes of wealth and poverty. It also has interesting things to say about the various mishaps and misunderstandings which occur when an anemic and inbred elite of artists and patrons tries to tackle the big issues of our age. In the movie, as in real life, most of these attempts are so ill-judged, naive or patronising that they become part of the problem, not part of the solution. ""The Square"" makes another valid point, to wit that good art tends to prove its own excellence, while mediocre art (or, as the case may be, mediocre ""art"") needs a lot of hoopla and razzle-dazzle. People will queue for hours in order to look at paintings by Rubens, for the simple reason that Rubens was an artist of great skill, imagination and depth ; but dragging the public to a mountain of broken window glass named ""Fraction / Refraction / Non-Topical Domain"" will call for some industrial-strength publicity. Finally ""The Square"" also points out, with considerable insight, that much of contemporary art depends upon a disdain for the past. Masterful friezes, iconic paintings, beloved statues are thrown into the dustbin, so that the public can experience the supreme delight of sitting in a bare room and staring at a white wall.In other words : ""The Square"" does possess insight, interest and topicality. However, I can't say that I really like the movie. Ironically, it seems to partake in some of the defects it decries, such as distance, sterility and yes, presumption. One can be kind and say that this is a perfect marriage of content and form, but still, I like to watch movies made with emotion and conviction. And while we're at it, I also like movies that appeal not only to my brain, but also to my heart.",The Square
19,valadas,Cute but not good,5,11 August 2018,"Cute because several stray scenes are funny (though a few with black humour not to mention of the very bad and ugly idea of showing a child, virtual though, exploding in the middle of the square that seems to be the movie's theme).
It looks like an ambitious movie in the sense of wanting to reveal the moral contradictions of our society but it doesn't come up much to that goal. It is therefore a great way off being a good film. It develops itself in somewhat disconnected sequences starting from two basis situations: a planned exhibition in a museum and the theft of the museum curator's wallet, cellphone and cuff-links outside in a public street by means of feigned assault scene where he tried to help the supposed victim and prevent the supposed assault among the passers-by that crossed the street totally indifferent to what was going on. From then on the curator gets himseld envolved in several confusions of doubtful meaning. A movie no more than tolerable.",The Square
20,shakercoola,Weird but thrilling meltdown drama,7,20 February 2019,A Swedish drama; A story about a curator who finds himself at the centre of a personal and career storm. This film has challenging themes and thought-provoking payoffs.

21,krocheav,The Square - Misses Its Target,5,19 August 2019,"At the outset, this good looking project promised to be a grand comment on the foolishness, and greed, that has taken over aspects of the modern art fraternity - instead, as it progressed, it sadly became precisely what it set out to parody. This is very unfortunate as it shows us the filmmaker was not particularly brave enough to deliver a focused message. Cinematographer and director work well together, turning in a visually excellent movie but this is far from good enough. With a script that ultimately offers little commitment, shape or true soul - it simply becomes a series of stylish but poorly connected sequences - pretentiously shouting to the viewer ""look at my savvy creativity"". Come the half-way mark of this unnecessarily over-long, disconnected effort, it becomes painfully obvious that we, the audience, are the ones being conned. Performances are uniformly good but, as for listing several international actors as stars - this is simply dishonest marketing - call them what they are: 'Guest Stars'.Then, we have the director/writer/co-editor indulging his fetishes by using (or is it abusing) actress Elizabeth Moss for a gratuitous sex scene that's initiated from simplistic 'c' word utterances. This segment goes on to simply culminate in one (of many) plot dead-ends - tending to look rather obviously added for its sensationalistic elements, then ultimately, coming across as simply perverse.Another major sequence features a man violently 'aping' an Ape which goes on far too long - only to also lead to yet another dead-end (with the truly shocking end result left hanging). Many will be seduced by this low approach to 'high-art' (just as the awards groups seem to be) but looking at the bulk of user comments (caringly penned by those who bought tickets and invested valuable time to see this so-called 'parody')...it becomes abundantly clear many observant viewers were awake to its superficial deceptions. Several mainstream critics were also honest enough to call it out for what it was.While some might rave, for equally as many, it's just another disappointing cop-out.",The Square
22,proud_luddite,A mixed result,6,1 January 2018,"A few days are chronicled in the life of Christian (Claes Bang), a curator of a modern art museum in Stockholm. He faces various challenges, the main one being the loss of his wallet and phone and the consequences of what he does to get them back.The situation mentioned above is the best one in the movie despite an unnecessary over-the-top dramatic scene in a rain-soaked garbage dump. The film's deepest flaw is that it takes on too many sub-stories that end up just barely touching the surface despite some fascinating scenes in all of them. This takes the viewer in too many directions and leaves a jumbled feeling by the end.The most renowned scene of the film is one in which a group of wealthy museum patrons are at a dinner and ""treated"" to a performance artist (Terry Notary) who acts like an ape-human and causes havoc on some of the guests. The scene is brilliantly executed. It is easy for the viewer to feel the fear of the patrons wondering what the beast-man will do next and who his next victim will be. But the major events that took place are never even referred to later on. It's like this scene was an extra short film on the side and had nothing to do with the general narrative.In some ways, ""The Square"" resembles ""La Dolce Vita"": an attractive, self-involved man who is very high on the social scale in a cosmopolitan setting feels a soullessness in his surroundings. Writer/director Ruben Ostlund - who did such a great job with ""Force Majeure"" a few years ago - shows great potential here as well. His occasional jabs against pretense, especially where modern art is concerned, are more than welcome. But overall, ""The Square"" might have been great if it hadn't taken on too much. - dbamateurcritic",The Square
23,maurice_yacowar,Contemporary art confronts but evades human savagery.,10,3 December 2017,"The Square is a piece of very contemporary art that is about very contemporary art and its ambivalent relationship to our social reality and responsibilities. ""Relational aesthetics"" is the interviewed artist's term, i.e., exploring the relationship between art and our social reality. The film itself is a work of art called ""The Square."" It's also about the events around the opening of a new exhibition called ""The Square."" As Christian cites the artist, ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" This art proffers what our real world should be, and what the film's real world denies.Squares abound outside that show. Christian is walking through a square when he becomes involved in a piece of street theatre that results in (i) his engagement with a screaming woman's ostensible assailant, and (ii) the theft of his wallet and cell phone. The most dynamic square in the film is the shots down the apartment building stairwells, a spiral of squares within squares, both in Christian's and in his victim boy's buildings. That stairwell was a popular motif in Hitchcock, where — as here — it serves as an image of the layered consciousness, spiralling vertiginously into danger. . As abundant as the square are the instances of performance, whether in art or in life. Christian's first scene with his daughters show both sides ""acting out."" This contrasts to the regimentation and discipline of the girls' acrobatic show. In several scenes artists are interviewed, which is a performance by artist and by questioner. The Tourette's Syndrome heckler violates the scene's normal decorum — and irrelevance to the real problems of the time. Here the mental disturbance is in the audience not in the maker of the art. The performance of the event barely survives the impulsive intrusion of reality. Christian's presentation as a flat, closed figure, with little emotional or psychological rounding, makes him a figure of constant performance. He's making speeches, whether to the public or to an aide. He ""performs"" charity when he begrudgingly buys the beggar woman a sandwich. His stolen money surprisingly returned, he rewards her again, but again ""performs"" as he peels off one bill after another. In bed with Anne, there is no connection or exchange between them Christian fumbles alone to don the condom. Their intimacy segues into the tension of a literal tug-of-war over who gets to dump the safe. Neither seems to trust the other with it, for its possibly antagonistic deployment later. Christian performs his white male adult authority when he tries to shoo away the insulted little boy. His video message to the lad is pure performance. His fear that he may have hurt or even killed the kid pushes Christian into an apology — which itself moves from personal admission into a practiced tract about our unjust society and our need for collective action. As if that excuses the lapse of the individual will. In short, this film seems the latest replay of Freud's seminal Civilization and its Discontents. The ultra sophistication of the most advanced and theoretical contemporary art may represent the peak of our civilization, but it's still just a hair away from man's essential savagery. The disciplined acrobatics are a fragile attempt to rein in the wildness and selfishness of the child — and their parents. An art project theoretically intended to address our highest social conscience exploits the sensation of blowing up a little girl.The theme is clearest at the Museum's banquet for the wealthy (white) donors, where the evening's entertainment is supposed to be the titillation of a performance artist, a muscular man playing ape. The audience clearly doesn't know how to deal with the artistic license they fund and purport to understand. They support the life energy of art — but only in its most controlled, antiseptic and safe forms. So they smile and titter away the actor's initial animalism. Breaking a glass shows him a threat to their order. Then at his first direct aggression, the men run away. When he ignores Christian's closing of his act, they all retreat into staring into their laps, as if discreetly ignoring the threat will make it disappear. Decorum uber alles. But then the actor assails a pretty young woman, first poising above her in admiration, then caressing her, then dragging her off by the hair to rape her. This rouses the white old men into action. They erupt in her defence and proceed to beat and kick the actor into submission. The apeman actor has exposed the tribal savagery still alive in this ultra-civilized gathering. Mercifully.",The Square
24,sharky_55,Pick the onions out yourself.,7,20 July 2019,"""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" So utters the artist's statement of the provocative new piece from the X-Royal art museum in Stockholm. It comes from the brilliant mind of chief curator Christian, a suave figure who glides between business meetings and official functions, hair slicked back, suit pressed. How fitting, then, that the film premiered at Cannes, with its protagonist a mirror image of the contemporary cultural elite it was unveiled to, having to witness Östlund skewer the very demographic they were part of.The opening takes aim squarely at this new target; in setting up The Square, Christian has a construction crew remove the rusty old war memorial that previously adorned the museum's plaza, only for the crane to clumsily decapitate the poor general. This initial blunder has the comedic poise of deadpan master Roy Andersson (a fellow Swede) at his peak, a decisive barb at the self-centredness and pretentiousness of the upper middle class. You almost expect them to simply leave the smashed statue as is, erect a rope barrier, and declare the scene their newest exhibit.Christian begins the film struggling to explain the complex, almost nonsensical jargon of the contemporary art world to a journalist who sees through his whole charade. Simultaneously, he is preparing for the unveiling of his new exhibit, itself an intricate performance complete with a precisely timed dummy call that gives him the opportunity to restart from a more 'authentic' level. Clearly, The Square is at its funniest when Östlund exposes the phony self-importance that this elite bubble is powered by, and the absurd lengths they will go to in order to preserve it. A museum cleaner is bewildered by how he must tiptoe around piles of pebbles, which results in the subsequent conversation a frantic Christian has with an assistant on how to reconstruct the exact make-up of these piles, with a worlds-away Moss (said journalist) none the wiser.But this pointed condemnation runs mostly through Christian himself, and that's when the film loses a bit of steam. Intent on setting him up as punching bag, the comparisons are nothing but overt. The irony is clear; Christian chides his surrounding citizens on their lack of conscious empathy, erecting The Square as a means of reinvigorating our shared social responsibility to behave. There's even a space, if you choose to place your trust in the collective, to leave your phone and wallet at the mercy of other museum visitors. Yet Christian can't relinquish these himself, or behave himself. A spark of impromptu bravado becomes the catalyst for a furious quest for his phone and wallet, no longer the well-dressed curator wielding the 'hammer' of justice, but an unhinged man stuffing angry notes into an entire apartment complex's letterboxes.Claes Bang does more than just pull his weight. His moment of triumph in the pedestrian square is his humanising moment, one to galvanise the audience into siding with his cause. And even when that collapses, he is unwavered; he is in the right here, doing his wider social circle a kindness in unveiling the magic of The Square. His deluded self-belief, even as the campaign self-destructs around him, is the performance's saving grace. The reveal of a family and his two daughters is treated almost as an afterthought, and although he drags them along to his moment of redemption, ostensibly to model how to take responsibility for one's actions, it becomes a narcissistic monologue, a one-man-show of deflection and shifting blame. What a weasel.Östlund's centrepiece, however, is performance art stretched to its limit. The ape act, posing the same questions that Pierre Brassau posed, pushes the audience further and further, inflating a moment of tension and discomfort until it bursts. The civility in the room is transformed from black tie banquet to one of primal instinct, the Christians of the room stooping to the same ape-like level. But what else are they supposed to do, sit there and watch the assault unfold? The scene is a microcosm of its whole, as confronting and provoking as Force Majeure, but with none of the subtlety. That it then abruptly cuts away to the streets of Stockholm, lined with the homeless bedding down for the night, is only further proof of this.",The Square

A good flick challenges, and if it siphons you in to process and try to understand that challenge, huzzah!The challenge being, of course, that under its base scenario of the high-flying modern art word is something almost crushingly quotidian; a man who's like most men: He's not the sharpest (moral) tool in the shed.In fact, he's so hapless that he's a hapless performance artist himself.

27,spookyrat1,Desperately Seeking An Editor (With Sharp Scissors)!,5,18 August 2020,"Ruben Ostlund's The Square could have been a pretty good satire with an independently - minded editor in the cutting room chair. Instead we get director Ostlund in there with an underling, resulting in a laboriously overlong, hit and miss comedy that explores the boundaries of political correctness, artistic liberty and free speech in provocative ways that don't always work. However it should be said, when it does hit the mark, there are some genuinely funny and cutting situations.Best of these in my opinion were the episodes involving Elisabeth Moss, who plays an American TV journalist. In the opening scenes she is a participant in a completely comically inept interview, with lead character, Christian, an art museum curator, currently overseeing a new project that reflects his social concerns. It's a space called The Square, a sanctuary where anyone entering it is supposed to abide by humanitarian values. There are later similarly entertaining scenes where she puts Christian under the pump in more literal ways and the by-play between the two, surely heavily improvised, is uncomfortably absorbing.There are other good scenarios involving outlandish public relations people and pretentious museum exhibits, that get, ahem, modified by the cleaners. But the trouble with The Square is that there is a lot of dross in between and it just keep coming for ... a whole 151 minutes. I had to laugh when I read about an interview that Ostlund gave, where he claimed every scene of the feature is crucial to achieving his complete artistic vision. Statements such as this I would have thought, are the sort of stuff he is roundly criticising in his movie.",The Square
28,Blue-Grotto,Ingenious Exploration of the Breakdown of Trust in Society,10,24 September 2017,"A wild man runs rampant through a crowd of elite dinner guests at their tables. According to instructions, those who do not look at or engage with the beast, will not be bothered in return. Yet this is only what they are led to believe, for the beast is about to violate their trust. The themes and story line of the Square expand on this theme. The film explores the breakdown of trust in society and the consequences of living in bubbles and attempting to insulate ourselves from harm.Christian, the main character, is an art curator who is both a victim and perpetrator of irresponsibility, indifference and arrogance. He suffers a series of misfortunes and bizarre situations including a stolen wallet, blackmail, sexual indiscretion and a social media campaign that backfires in an explosive way. While appearing outwardly calm, Christian is an unstable man. He is unable or unwilling to connect with the life, good and bad, that surrounds him. The consequences of this inaction are far reaching, both for society and his psyche.The Square is compelling and persuasive in part because it is not judgmental and preachy. The peculiar and ingenious scenes provide jolts to perspectives without forcing conclusions. Cares and worries drop away, or are seen in a different light, because the story is so intriguing. The film is balanced in its portrayal of characters. It provides much food for thought. The acting is superb. The director of the film is hopeful that we can begin to heal our trust in others. By way of illustrating this he gave his wallet to a woman in the front row of the theater at the Toronto International Film Festival. She returned it at the end of the film.

29,skepticskeptical,Target: The State of Western Civilization,8,30 March 2020,"I have noticed that when reviewers at imdb don´t like a film, their favorite term of derogation tends to be ´pretentious´. Turns out that it usually means that the film is not mindlessly generic.The Square offers a rather labyrinthine but nonetheless scathing critique of the Capitalist Art Complex and PC culture running rampant especially in places such as Sweden (which is the setting). The main protagonist, Christian, is just a cog in the wheel, but he has risen in the ranks to become the curator of a prestigious (and wealthy, thanks to mega-wealthy donors) modern art museum. Which means, of course, that it displays the works of modern artists, who these days must of necessity become con artists if they are ever to get their work displayed anywhere. Dominic West plays one such ¨artiste¨ in a minor role in the film. Elisabeth Moss plays a journalist who chronicles all of the nonsense and so is caught up in the fraud as well. Christian the curator (played by Claes Bang) is essentially a smooth-talking showman, who introduces ¨important¨ artists and maintains the image of a place where fancy parties and dinners are paid for, along with the commissioned art, by ¨distinguished¨ (= rich) donors.Is this film pretentious? No, it assails the pretentious and the fraudulent, while managing also to present a richly developed character (Christian) who has succeeded in this world without having completely lost his soul--at least not yet. Professionally speaking, he´s a fraud in a fraudulent system, who has to believe that he deserves what he has achieved. His initial interactions with other persons are often curt and dismissive, but then he revisits his treatment of others, using the cultural framework within which he finds himself. He´s supposed to act a certain way, according to PC culture, so he tries to do so, but does he have genuine remorse or does he only regret that he has not followed the rules which all good people are supposed to follow?It´s anyone´s guess what Christian will try next... Will he join the ranks of the homeless on the streets of Stockholm? No, it seems more likely that he´ll cash in some stock options and do quite well, despite having been sacked from the job which provided him with all of the power that he ever had.",The Square
30,ThurstonHunger,"Don't Happy, Be Worried",7,3 May 2021,"This film absolutely cherishes confrontation and controversy, so the director/writer must be pleased by the range of reviews here. That alone may make this worth a watch for many...myself included. The borders of life are always interesting, especially the one that divides the delighted and the disgusted.Personally I found myself on the border of The Square. Never fully drawn within, but not turning a blind eye and a power-off button. Honestly for a 142 minute film it did not feel overly long, although the scene from the cover image went on too long. While that was nice for Terry Notary who rarely gets much direct screen time though many have seen his work, I think that scene is telling.To me, the director is so desperate for a captive audience, and ideally one they can make squirm. Certainly he likes to set the stage for things to go even further astray then they do in this film. Christian's daughters are involved in several of those cases. I know I am grateful a gymnast did not explode.I do agree with the detractors here that calling this a ""comedy"" is a stretch. Although the docents and cleaning crew in the museum had their moments.What is art's role in society? Well, surely it's multifaceted, but erring on the side of challenging is generally worthwhile. Capsizing oneself in that effort though gives pause.And what is man's obligation to his fellow ape?While I suspect even outside stylish art galleries, we (Sapiens and lower) have always been a bit too eager to jump to outrage; these days even without performance artists and guerrilla marketing teams, that jump is prodded more than ever.

31,Andres-Camara,We should ask ourselves if it presumes what it lacks,3,1 February 2018,"The only thing I like about this movie is that it is a criticism of the absurdity that can sometimes result in many eyes, the art world. If the fact that someone says it, it means that something is already good. The problem is that it is the same thing that happens to the film, due to the fact that they do it, it does not have to be good and for my taste it is not.It has many script failures, the protagonist is presented and half a movie, we learn part of his life that we did not know, which on the other hand, does not count anything in the rest of the film. Start topics that do not end. Many things are known.Let's not mention the moments of endless abstract art. It seems that they will never end.The movie goes from one place to another and you do not know what rumba it takes.

32,rubenm,Powerful satire about modern western society,7,3 December 2017,"A man's nice, comfortable and structured life is turned upside down by a sudden incident. This was the case in Ruben Östlund's film 'Turist' from 2014, and it is again the case in 'The Square'. But this time, the film is more ambitious. Not only the values of the lead character are questioned, but also Swedish society as a whole, and maybe even western civilization itself.In 'The Square', museum manager Christian has to cope with a multitude of crises. After his wallet has been stolen, he succeeds in getting it back by working out a clever plan, but this soon backfires in an unexpected way. At the same time, a press campaign for a new museum exhibition turns into a public relations disaster. And on top of all this, a one night stand with an attractive American journalist also takes its toll.Östlund tackles a lot of themes. 'The Square' is about an art project meant to promote human kindness and mutual understanding, but Christian is not so kind and understanding towards many of his fellow citizens. It is a metaphor for the way Sweden handles its immigrant population. Another theme is freedom: modern art is supposed to be a domain of ultimate freedom of expression, but when the museum issues a very provocative campaign, Christian is forced to backtrack. And there is the arts theme: Östlund enjoys himself ridiculing the modern art community with its hollow phrases and self-indulgence.This last theme is shown in one of the most hilarious and at the same time unsettling scenes of the movie, in which guests to a fund- raising dinner are treated to the performance of an ape-man. This wonderful scene alone is worth seeing the film.There are many scenes like this, balancing between funny and disquieting. Another example is an early scene, in which Christian thinks to have rescued a terrified woman from an aggressive man, only to find out that his wallet and his smartphone have been stolen. These scenes are the strongest moments of the film. In others, Östlund rubs in the message with a bit too much emphasis. For example, when Christian records a movie with his smartphone, in which he repents for his insensitive behaviour.'The Square' is a powerful satire about modern western society, and it has some very good scenes. But is also a bit fragmented and aimless, because Östlund wants to convey too many messages at the same time.",The Square
33,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"An extremely intriguing, singular viewing experience",9,25 August 2021,"This is the most intrigued I have felt by a movie while watching it in quite some time. It is the first thing I've seen by Swedish writer/director Ruben Östlund and it's instantly made me a fan. I slept on it for 4 years because it simply didn't seem that a movie about a minimalist art installation could possibly be that entertaining, especially not a 2.5 hour movie, but I was very wrong.Somehow THE SQUARE manages to stay gripping with every scene, even though it is just about plotless and half of the time you may not even be sure what is going on. The director has stated he will never include a scene in any of his movies that exist simply to move the narrative forward - this seems a task that would be incredibly difficult to pull off, but the way that he does it makes for an incredibly unique and enveloping viewing experience. I honestly expected this to be a pretty absurdist/surrealist film, but in the end it's actually pretty straightforward - it just focuses on such obscure circumstances and details that it ends up having a strange, dreamlike quality. Of course, the highly eccentric characters add to this value a great amount - ESPECIALLY queen Elisabeth Moss, of course, who I had no idea was even gonna be in this! What a PLEASANT surprise - another fully ICONIC role to add to the Moss list - she is the absolute best at playing the most intense characters - I love her. She has some legendary scenes in this movie.Though you may not pick up on all the themes your first watch-through, they are all very articulate and universally relative once you make sense of them. Watching the movie is a bit like solving a puzzle but even when you are unsure of what's happening, you can still feel its purpose - you can feel the heart of it all beating. The cinematography is beautiful. The music has great character. And it doesn't hurt that the lead actor Claes Bang has an extremely comforting, grounding energy - and, he's quite studly and charming in a Rupert Everett sort of way.A lot of people asked me ""Have you seen The Square?"" over the last 4 years. I was always aware of it and I always asked ""Was it good? Should I?"" and everyone seemed to respond, ""I'm...not sure. I liked it. It definitely stood out. There were some crazy parts. I dunno"" - so, I didn't rush to it. But, I'm gonna be the guy to break that cycle in this circle. This movie is a singular masterpiece, ok? This movie is BRILLIANT. Yes, you should see it.Now I've gotta see his breakthrough movie... Force Majeure, and get stoked for his upcoming 2022 movie, starring Woody Harrelson and two sexy Danish models...

34,coreyjdenford,Four sides of funny,8,16 March 2018,"This review of The Square is spoiler free**** (4/5)SOME FILMS YOU watch, some films you feel, some you cherish and some you hail for their pure ingenious techniques to make you think - by that same meticulous logic, The Square - yet another film about the contemporary world it's also a film you get smacked hard in the chops by. Not by its genius techniques of artful pleasure or its masterful plunge into society monkeys, but by its plain ferocity, it's ambitious style and its pure ability to harm you with shock tactics. Put simply; it's both inherently shocking and brilliantly smart at the same time. Which makes Swedish writer-director Ruben Östlund a director to watch and to cherish; he's a man who isn't afraid to make films by his own point of view, a view that sees the complications, the crisis and the challenges of the world we live in. Previously these tactics were seen in his festival favourite Force Majeure, a film about confronting the inevitable and learning to surpass it. 
 
His latest is just as complicated, just as challenging and just as thought provokingly smart. He switches from the cold summits of the French Alps to the warm, comforting cityscape of Stockholm. We open with Christian (Claes Bang) the respected chief curator of a contemporary art museum which is at the brink of unveiling a new exhibit one which he hopes will change the art world by bringing people together, with trust and by sharing, it's also one which he hopes will make him famous by becoming a viral success. On the journey to world-wide success his life starts overcoming difficulties, he becomes a victim of a personal and professional crisis, and he often falls to his own egotistical actions.Östlund's technique is not only using Christian as the victim, through his often hilarious and super-smart script, political correctness also takes a bit of a bashing. There are some moments here that are genuinely harsh (Elizabeth Moss' American journalist mimics the foul-mouthed stuttering of a man suffering from Tourette's syndrome). Apart from that moment which may leave divided, his script is super-smart and laugh-out-loud funny; it's a film where grown-ups behave so appallingly. An argument over a condom in one of the funniest sex scenes and post sex scenes in recent years. Another standout is Terry Notary's (War for the Planet of the Apes) terrifying chimpanzee shriek during a party dinner.As a director he's brilliant - beautifully exploring Stockholm's Art Nuveau landscape as his camera stunningly glances through the poorer regions of Sweden's capital. The Square isn't a perfect film, at 2 hours 31 minutes long Östlund's astute gazing loses its touch within the last act it couldn't have done any harm to add some cuts to the final product. Still, this is an inherently stunning film while it may not be perfect, it's surely something to cherish.
 
VERDICT Despite the sudden drop Östlund's latest project is a powerful, sometimes silly artscape that's ambitious and so jaw droppingly funny that it hurts.",The Square
35,fciocca,"A strongly critical movie toward our society, visually appealing. It definitely needs some cutting.",6,8 November 2021,"""The Square'' contains a lot of criticism about different topics: how for some wealthy people appearances are everything and how they can fake their interests, just to maintain their public image, when in reality they do not care about art. This is well represented by Christian, a museum curator that clearly does not pay much attention to expositions and focuses all his attention on himself. He has a lot of charisma and he manages to capture the attention of his financers to get the money, but then, he works on projects very superficially. He never cares about other people, and he exploits his position of power to get what he wants, does not matter if it is immoral. This goes strongly against the next exposition that he needs to present to the X-Royal Museum, which is all about compassion and altruism. The director created a good dichotomy and was able to show many social issues that are known and addressed, but never really dealt with, because of the egoistic nature of modern society. Or at least this is how I have interpreted this film by Ruben Östlund. I think that everyone can see something different in this film, depending on their personal experience. I personally think that in order to fully understand it, this needs to be watched more than once.This movie needs to be heavily cut down. There are a couple of storylines that in my opinion do not fit very well, just dragging the plot. Two hours and a half is definitely too much, and I got bored several times, wondering when it was finally coming to an end, especially in the second half. Some dialogues last longer than they should, some scenes do not make any sense. Ideas are good, and I really enjoyed this philosophical film, but unfortunately the execution was pretty disappointing.",The Square
36,kaptenvideo-89875,"Situational comedy about polarities (yes, it's artsy)",7,10 September 2017,"Most of you may know the Swedish screenwriter-director Ruben Östlund thanks to his previous project, 2014's Turist"" – Force Majeure"" internationally –, an acclaimed psychological drama about man not being man enough"" when his family's lives are endangered by an avalanche in ski resort. Östlund continues exploring ""Turist's"" major theme further here: comfort zones and what happens when we dare or are forced to leave them. Comfort zones govern our lives – we create them for personal use and on every level of human society – but in order to reach new grounds, we need to leave them. And if the zones end or vanish for some reason, the life as we have known it can break down quite easily. Turist"" is about one specific situation, The Square"" explores the theme connected to art world, although art can be seen as metaphor for man's creative or spiritual side, which to me seemed even more suitable. The central character is an director of a museum (played by Claes Bang), a nice guy who gets into trouble both in private life and professionally. It plays out like a situational comedy about polarities, in art, our life and modern man in general. Through different scenes and events we get to witness and contemplate about how modern man wants everything to be ""simple"" – black or white, either/or – but there are always two sides to everything, and you can't really have the one without the other. For example, We want the art to mean something and touch us deeply, but don't like to invest ourselves and open up for it; we want to express ourselves freely but can't necessarily tolerate others also doing this; we want power but we don't like responsibilities, etc etc. Yes, the approach is rather artsy but the movie is still pretty mainstream friendly, thanks to all the ""comedy"". Actors do wonderful job illustrating all these polarities on screen. This long 142 minute movie follows and examines the characters closely and relies on nuanceful performances quite heavily. The main problem is the directing style which sometimes seems to slow down just because, not that a situation couldn't be done any faster. There are scenes where camera finds it target and just stays with it almost to the point of dozing off, just because it can. I think Östlund has tried to prove a point – we want fast results, not to invest ourselves – but I also think he has overused it here. Movies nowadays are usually not that slow anymore, and it wears you down getting accustomed to this slowness. But it's still an intriguing and quite powerful movie about what life and art mean, or can mean. For its common ground, but also for its dark humor, expressiveness and inventiveness, The Square"" is like a dark companion piece for Jodorowski's joyous Poesía sin fin"" which also hit our cinemas recently. I can't say I understood the meaning of the major setpiece of performance artist attacking"" a fancy gala party, but I loved it (the poster shows him too). He's like an uncanny mix of Bruce Lee and monkey man! That's what art is supposed to be all about, I guess: taking us out of our comfort zones and making us feel something even without understanding it well. By the way, although most of the dialogue is in Swedish, some is in English and some major supporting characters are played by people we know from American entertainment, such as Dominic West (The Wire"", The Affair"") and Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men"").",The Square

There is a gorilla in the picture, invisible to all, just as in the well known psychological experiement. A real and man-made primate appear but these are the harmless ones.

40,treywillwest,nope,9,16 July 2021,"I had put off watching this Palme D'Or winning film for a couple of years because the label ""satire"" had been attached to it and I tend not to be a fan of that sub-genre. Too often, satire treats its subject with such contempt that even in the most celebrated cases, ""Dr. Strangelove"", say, or ""M*A*S*H"", it presents itself as so above what it purports to be about that it ends up seeming apropos of nothing. That ""The Square"" transcends such genre traps is part of what makes it such a rewarding experience.""The Square"" is, indeed, a satire of the high (particularly contemporary) art world, and a very good one. Those familiar with this world will chortle at the film's pillorying of curatorial attempts to ""say"" what a work of art ""means"", and those of us who have engaged in such practices will wince as we chuckle. But this movie is also much more than that, and its ultimate subject is not just the art scene, but the nature of human interaction.The main reason the film is set in a contemporary art museum isn't to mock this milieu but to demonstrate that even in such an edifice of ""high culture"" humanity has never really transcended the jungle. All of us scattered individuals are at the mercy of chance and of each other. We must continuously react to these threats and opportunities in order to survive, and this gives us very little time or opportunity to empathize with, and attempt to help, each other. But the illusion of order, culture, has imbued our species with an aspiration for altruism. This leaves the human animal in a double bind: not only can we not help each other, or get help from each other, we have to feel guilty about it.DOP Fredrik Wenzel feels the screen with appropriately painterly colors. The hues are beautifully autumnal. Writer-director Ruben Ostlund's frames are very geometric. There are, indeed, a lot of squares on display in the film. Such architectural mise-en-scene would generally imply a fatalistic outlook, and it does so in some sense here. But there is a motif of squares within squares in which something surprising and chaotic suddenly occurs within one of the squares, affecting the totality even while being visually limited to its one level. The juxtaposition of geometric order and visual uncertainty implies a very unique world-view: chaotic inevitability.As much as ""The Square"" pokes fun at the art-world it is in no sense an ""anti-art"" movie, as many such satires would end up being. For, in a very un-satirical way, it offers its characters, and its audience, empathy for our painful inability to empathize. ""The Square"" affirms the role of art by being first-rate art. Indeed, it leaves the viewer wondering if perhaps art isn't the only thing that can help us.",The Square

Although the modern art is very easy target for parody and satire, 'The Square' does not fall into banal mockery of subject and touches the matter quite briefly. I mean, there are not too many puns towards the art scene. The film concerns more about other, and more serious subjects that definitely needs the discussion - political correctness, freedom of speech and creativity, how far we must go with tolerance, the hypocrisy about the care for weaker ones.

It tackles lot of topics, from art of course, individualism, middle class, sex, media and advertising, freedom of speech, prejudice or smartphones. And many more.
This makes the movie quite comprehensive, with at least a few topics speaking to anyone, but also without a true guiding principle. We sometimes get lost, missing a dramatic progression. It is also sometimes lacking by using what it criticizes - brainy, flashy and artsy.
There are however powerful scenes, and the one that is used as poster is one the most brilliant - most would have cut it long before but its duration is what makes it so powerful.True satire, you will laugh, but generally sourly with your teeth grinding.
The result is a bit too long and too preaching. I think the Cannes Palme d'Or is putting also too much expectation of the spectator and can create some disappointment.

However as the Christian and his team try to create a striking marketing video, the intriguing art of society and interaction begin to intrigue the curator's taste.Winner of the Palme d'Or Award at the Cannes film festival, The Square is an fresh satire of humor, and drama that will be one you'll never forget. Exhibiting a range of visual imagery coated over the disturbing obsession of art lovers, with surprisingly underscore of the modern behavior of people in a common society.With the very brilliant Claes Bang as our leading curator touring us through a personal journey of discovering after the simple act of having his wallet and phone stolen. From then Christian finds himself unveiling an artwork morality in the modern day and age as he collides with various members of society, from the homeless, to a one night stand, and angry boy accused of being a thief. Bang is a marvellous presence in his charm of being a passionate at exhibitor, strong in power, but also sloppy and abusive in his treatment of those around him. Christian becomes adamant to open the new exhibit from the ""The Square"" only revealing to public that ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations"".Östlund's film almost then becomes an exhibition on life itself and human behavior, trying to reach out to the audience on silent human decency that the world sourly needs. Bangs interaction with the people he meets are what set this message in motion. But it is far from an enriching and moving piece of moral exploration. With one narrative thread examining the media response to a controversial video ad, to the iconic but yet shocking performance art set piece of Terry Notary hounding the guest of the museum during his portrayal as a while ape. It from these moments that make The Square a difficult film to connect with or even really understand completely, but still admire its bold and disturbing displays of the madness of modern art.A very odd but intriguing picture to say the least, but fascinating in its portrayal and assessment to the modern ways of society, masked with its comedic take on the world of ridiculously ambiguous displays of contemporary art",The Square

Still the movie left me bored and restless.The storytelling is decided by the chronology of events. Meaning that when you leave one scene and go to the next it is the simple result of time passing by instead of having the inner logic of a string of events decide the matter. Themes can be identified but you drift in and out of them.I suppose that this is the way all of us experience life. Events are related, sometimes not at all, sometimes coincidences changes your life and sometimes it does because of specific decisions.

Some of the scenes are spot-on critiques of the art world. However, the movie wanders aimlessly without a thread that drives the plot from beginning to end. The main thing the audience learns is that the director of the modern art gallery is a self centered, arrogant racist, which isn't much to hang a film on let alone get people excited about. I don't mind terrible protagonists, but give me one strong, main plot, instead of three or more weak ones.Claes Bang plays the museum director, Christian, and some of his dialogue is hilarious. Anne, Elisabeth Moss, has a one night stand with the arrogant Christian and she wants more. But then that plot line dies and another about Mr. Bang's missing wallet takes over. None of the story lines are fully developed and it makes a film about modern art too artsy and annoying. Luckily the dialogue and bizarre situations in the film make The Square worth a look.The filming and scenes are fine, but I didn't walk away amazed.

Just one example: the scene with the ape street performer ran for something like 7-8 minutes. We thought it could have been done in a fraction of that and nothing would have been lost. Then I later thought they could have done without it entirely and I'm not sure anything would have been lost.The scene with the museum director given the speech on the steps of the foyer? What was the point? What did it add? Nothing that we could see.Scene after scene we turned to each other and asked the same question.So instead of being a tight 1:30 to 1:45 movie, this ran on for a tedious 2 and a half hours.I have a personal rule of thumb when it comes to films. Movies that are written and directed by the same person are so often self-indulgent. I'm going to have to amend that to: movies written, directed and edited by the same person are invariably self-indulgent and way too long.A good director here would have told the writer what was wrong with the script and suggested what needed to be rewritten. A good editor would have gone back to the director and told him that it was running too long and that by cutting this or that that the result would have been better.Unfortunately this film has, needless to say, the same person in all three roles. and as a result, it's way too long and was just tedious.Sorry, but I just don't understand the rave reviews some have given this. Yes, this is ALMOST a good film. But only ALMOST.",The Square

59,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,The Hypocrisy of Art,8,8 April 2018,"Part art-world satire, part absurdist comedy and part social-commentary, watching The Square is like wandering around an art gallery. Anyone who's been to an art gallery will recognise the stillness and slow pace (which accounts for the two-and-a-half hour running time) but despite this, there are lots of comic moments, including an ill-advised advertising campaign and the live performance art seen on the film's poster. The film is really hinged on Stockholm's X-Royal Gallery's lead curator, Christian Nielsen (Klaes Bang), who fobs off American reporter Anne (Elizabeth Moss) when she probes into the nonsensical art-speak on his website. It's a great moment of culture clash as Anne concedes to his European philosophising which is professional BS-ing.Christian's social apathy is reflected by the public, as crowds of people wander past street beggars, glued to their smartphones. Initially the social commentary is more under the radar with the focus on comedy but near the end of the film, it's soapbox territory. Your mileage on that may vary- is writer/director Ruben Ostlund mouthing off about the problem of homelessness or is it a study of middle class guilt? I would say it's the latter- Christian is only struck by small moments of generosity when he's doing well for himself. Besides, unless you are an artist who is actively engaged in social work, you can hardly make a film criticising art's exploitation of social deprivation unless you are a massive hypocrite.The film's title refers to the X-Royal gallery's latest art installation- a lit-up outline of a square in the gallery's courtyard, with a plaque that says within the space of this square, everyone has equal rights. Is it genuinely thought-provoking or is it merely paying lip-service? Though the film is satirical, it does make you think about the point of art.Though Dominic West gets equal billing with Elisabeth Moss, his is only really a cameo, as the artist of one of the gallery's exhibitions 'Mirrors and Piles of Gravel'. Sporting a pair of horrid yellow sunglasses that bring to mind 90's Britpop, he is the typical pretentious artist.Without wishing to give more away, the comedy ranges from satirical to black comedy to absurdist comedy. One particular bit of gross-out comedy means that you might wish to leave the children/grandparents at home, unless you enjoy the awkwardness.One final note- despite the majority of the film being in Swedish, there are a couple of scenes in English, so that should open it out to audiences who hate reading subtitles.",The Square
60,HarlequeenStudio,Inconoclastic iconoclasm,9,1 December 2018,"Just when I thought that Sweden has lost the plot completely, it seems that it can still laugh at itself. The film pretty much smashes the established value system simply by showing that 'liberal' arts are owned by the 1%. This quote by Vivienne Westwood sums it up: ""We don't have any artists today, they don't have any vision whatsoever and that's why they're not artists, they are just 'in it for the money' kind and talking about themselves. If they do reflect the times then it just shows how awful it is and it's about ugliness if they are trying to do anything. ""
Claes Bang with his Cary Grant looks plays a screwball type of manchild who somehow holds the chief curator position of a prestigious contemporary art museum (Bringing Up Baby, anyone?). Surrounded by dimwits and wannabes, the position earned by his own gobbledygook, he staggers from one embarrassing situation to another, completely stunned. The film's sterile, ""Waiting for Godot"" looks creates the right kind of mood. The situations are funny, but this is no comedy. This is the end of western civilization.",The Square
61,carlo_simone18,Unique and Unconventional,7,30 May 2018,"'The Square' is certainly a viewing experience I will not be forgetting in a long while. As a satire of the art world it is often funny, sometimes even hilarious, and it provides for some extremely absurd scenes which keeps you engaged as you wonder what is going to come next. It all works towards some thought-provoking themes about human behaviour, the superficiality of art and the way modern society functions which I felt was explored really well.I really enjoyed Claes Bang's performance as the art curator Christian with how he deals with all the chaos that goes on around him at the museum as well as in his private life. The supporting players are pretty decent as well with Elizabeth Moss, Dominic West, and Terry Notary playing their parts well.A particular scene with Notary is a standout in a piece of performance art where he acts like an ape in a dining room full of the elites of the art world and it gets a bit out of hand. It is a very powerful and intriguing scene. However, it seems detached from the rest of the film as there are only a couple of hints about it beforehand and there is no mention of it afterwards in the narrative.Another problem I have is the introduction of Christian's children which I found to be rather unnecessary as there is no point to them being there. They add basically nothing to the narrative and I feel it would have been better if they had been cut from the film entirely to shave a few minutes off the runtime.In the end though I thoroughly enjoyed the unconventional structure the film possessed and would recommend watching this for the experience of it.",The Square

63,welshnew50,"Succeeds in portraying futility of changing-all through art, but targets too narrowly.",5,17 August 2020,"Without having known anything about this film, when seeing it on TV, i have to say, it did not at first catch my interest nor get me interested in the main character throughout the entire first hour, but as soon as the moment of uncertainty/fear about who had sent the letter coincided with the when-staying-positive-mistake to publish/accept the hostility-against the poor/refugees/innocent video , i suddenly became interested as a couple of potential plots against this over-conceptualiser / disproportion-of-impact advocate, could've started to unfold.That was perhaps a too-many-bloody-movies optimistic POV on how the movie could've satisfied those wishing a more bloody dead-end for those who play their part in art-embezzlement/money-laundering,
but alas, as it then in a relatively short period of time, brought us BACK to a more disappointing(for me) , less-dramatic reality.I did soon start to appreciate what they were trying to do with the ""are you (a?) Christian"" (ommitted)question at the bottom of the stairwell, and the reason to display the carelessness of the detached-from-sensitivity/carelessness with others' reputations, the lack of care on the main character's part, which when having seen i was only momentarily thinking would be a general point about BEING a christian, for contrast with what people who CALL-THEMSELVES one, as is in many similar making-a-point movies contrasting the same.But as the mmm,.. delayed? backwards? sort of way that the main character's SHIFT was quite clearly and realistically shifted back to 'being human' you might say, it did then portray well, the despicable CONDITIONALITY of 'humanity', then creating the clarity of the carelessNESS, of the personality / standpoint(s)/positions, simplified in many of the characters, and obviously metaphorically in the room of guests trampled over by the character completely off-his-tits going ape.-------So put another way, this backwards-unwinding of the reasons for the difficult to follow metaphors / slice-of-life sequences of scenes where the main character's moments of acting in only a slightly different if at all, way, from what's presumably meant to be a otherwise-mostly totally heartless then-even-worse majority of self-interested characters like those in that dinner with the guy gone-ape,..... it DOES succeed, in getting to that indirect-comparative which as long as you notice it / get it,.. can be quite clear compared to other movies like this buried inamongst too many subplots or multiple themes, where too much is trying to be done in just 1 movie, and it becomes jumbled and lost.So thumbs UP! for that reduction.-------BUT ;Like many other Euro-movies where there is too little of DIFFERENT, COMPLEX, Europeans,.. there is too much of a simplification of the rich, or too much of a simplification/homogenisation of those born into privilege, etc,
rather than there being a bit of character-diversity.And the perhaps editing and directing, to crop the american 1-nighter into some kind of metaphoric 'alternative'-to-tradition with her chimp companion, and deliberately-unexplained source of choices for the guy who went ape at the dinner, was too heavily edited.If the, after-he-rejects-her-sexism/prejudice -reason, for cutting her out of the rest of the movie , was going to be done to stimulate depth and questions-of-being then it wasn't much of a plot contribution, but considering that the character was already a decision maker in a museum, that kind of worked in a broad 5th-window sense of it not needing to be much of a continued-contribution to the plot, even though it's meant to have affected him.Still, cutting like that seemed like removing a bit too much in favour of unnecessarily-long atmospheric empty halls and around-corners shots, of, ok, yes we got that ... cold, careless European corridors and basements, perhaps perhaps-not patrolled from the POV of the audience noticing that more easily/rapidly.If watching depressing movies like that is something you feel like doing to yourself when feeling guilty, or wanting to prompt yourself or something,.. then sure, that's a part of the atmosphere of the setting.-----------But if you don't want to spend your time watching some twat in boring not-interested-in-the-character phone conversations ... (cheap filler sometimes) ... then i have to say i took 2 stars out for the combination of wasted time / unnecessary character-introduction ... when more could've been done with other characters, especially his daughters, even if you cut the 1-nighter out of it, or say, i think, i would've made it a on-drugs ... did-I-imagine-a-chimp? moment with her having a realistic REASON for having a chimp in the first place.It did NOT succeed, as some kind of surrealism art-rotissery/scrolling-sensorama squence, where you could throw a chimp in and most people wouldn't've even noticed it.Instead, having that inamongst what's meant to be a otherwise in-the-real-world movie (no dream sequences, etc), really did not blend well with the rest of it being SET, in normal reality.Having had a could it be a dream, could it be something else? AMBIGUITY, of why he saw a chimp, probably would've been better / more flexible, or let WHY, be unanswered, instead of there needing to be a plot-reason, which then detracted from the overall realism needed to affect those in positions of making decisions about art and money-laundering-through-(non)art.-------------So overall, it definitely could've had less near- empty-footage bits and pieces in amongst the scenes, a little less atmosphere, and a little MORE between-characters contrast of attitudes TOWARDS the then focused-upon blown-up innocent, such as the daughters actually having DIALOGUE about how he treated the kid he falsely accused of being a thief.Although the humanity was there, and the difficulty of his position in terms of TIME, the pressure upon him, in terms of portraying sequences of events, unrealistic expectations on a person in his position ( i don't mean the publishing, i mean at-home, out the workplace expectations), and the it's-unfair-upon-me POV he had to go through compared to other directors, other board members, etc...... this film also SIMPLIFIES,.. does not diversify, when it could've and perhaps should've ... both board members,.. rich-diners,.. family members,.. etcThere was clearly MEANT to be why-did-daddy-do-that? On the faces of the daughters,..... but that was avoided and only silence portrayed instead.----------YES, some come from dysfunctional families where silence is preferred,..... but NOT ALL DO.The myth that everyone chooses silence,.. is, a lie. IS, a myth.-----------It is perpetuated by people who WANT to make fear reliable.And that is why movies like this are ALMOST as bad as it gets in terms of further-self-inflation of self-conceptualisation(s) ... which further feeds the arrogance with which a lot of modern and neo-modern European art is ACTUALLY received, compared to the pretence that much of it is supposedly received in only stupefied, ignorant, non-awareness of the subliminal, or impact-upon-emotion everyone's-vulnerable from emotional manipulation.In reality, people not only ;
1 get USED TO emotional manipulation, but they also
2 desensitise,
3 REFINE their knowledge and ability to discriminate between different abstractisms,..... but also just like a museum goes that has to PAY, compared to a free one ...... get used to guessing or at least imagining the INTENT, of the artists and directors and stylists and even locale-decorators, or caterers even, if food is combined with a theme at a museum event that has a dinner beforehand. (within overall 'experience' )The pretence that both experience with the art itself, and a erroneously simplified/fused single-experience lie, are somehow indistinguishable compared to how/when a person who would be assessing art WITHOUT decorations, withOUT, a style, withOUT, and food... or anything else, for a 'experience',
not only CREATES errors in conceptualisation and audiences comprehensions,.. but it also gets used to again homogenise, RATHER than admit diversity OF audience - and therefore likely if not inevitable DIFFERENT reactions to the same art.=======So sorry, but that's always pretentious, and always dramatises the 'part-to-play' in the drama that is pretending that modern art and styles-of ... ACTUALLY DO, affect us in the way that is claimed.*scoff*Want to affect people?Then get real. It is the lesson to be learnt by most artists in most art that seeks to affect choices IN reality, without centering WHEN you'll be making a decision by the time you get back to reality.In THAT regard, this film did NOT do that well - and because it gambled with a backwards reasons-for-things plot-twist progression, it did not get people thinking about what they DO back in reality BEFORE then fleshing-out the main character's life,
and then using contrast with other characters' reasons for different choices, such as EASILY could've been done with the no-stable-home/no-parents-at-home daughters and their care for the potential-boy-next-door/neighbour.--------Instead, it avoided those contrasts in more spoken, or expressed ways,.. and instead relied upon assumed-rather-than-expressed subtleties of body language and mood.That works for some, but it doesn't-register, for others. Not reliable.They did combine that with the atmosphere though.If that combination, presumably, FOR the silence theme/repetition-of-choice , had been done with less TIME-wasted ... and more conflict with others who CHOOSE differently,..... then this film would be more valuable.
Instead, it will remain a portraying-only-silence, fear-as-reliable, false, you-CAN-find-indifference-to-hide-in-and-join-the-careless,
shallow-cynical self-crepulence.

Much of the film is a clever and astutely observed series of events which illustrate how political correctness has warped into impossible dilemmas for good and honest people, and how the simplicity of life has been removed to be replaced with a bizzare hipocracy which uses political correctness simply to persecute others. I'm making it sound heavy and political, but it isn't.. this is done through humour and well set up scenes. Maybe a film more appealing to intellectuals, but not at all boring and dry. Indeed I was laughing out load so many timea because I could relate to the craziness that modern society has become.

The drawbacks: too long (2 hours and a half), too many topics, chaotically represented: the falsities of multiculturalism, the feminist follies, the alienation, the emptiness of modern art -- only one or two of these should have been selected.

One of the other reviewers said it well- if you've watched 30 minutes and are waiting for something to happen.... stop. Just stop. We watched it with that same anticipatory feeling. I think it has to do with how the movie is advertised and marketed. Everything we read said it was hilarious or led to some sort of introspection. I mean, maybe, but to me, watching it felt like I was watching real life in some way. People suck, the world sucks, and here's why it sucks. Maybe that's what it's going for, in some high art way, but in today's grim world, that's not what I want in a movie. If nothing else, there needs to be an arc of some kind.

73,rdolan9007,An arty film about art with an incoherent plot.,6,3 January 2019,"I'm not quite sure whether this is meant to be a comedy, or something more serious. It's possible, obviously, that it can be both, but the main problem is that this film doesn't appear to know either. This doesn't help the plot which examines a man Christian (Claes Bang) who works at an art museum trying topublicise an art exhibition whilst his private life is a mess. His performance is fine if remote; not helped by having to deal with some bizarre changes in tone in the film.The problems in tone are exemplified by his relationship with Elizabeth Moss playing an art critic, which is funny, and then surreal, and includes a bizarre moment in the bedroom which inadvertantly explores the elastic properties of a condom. Nope, I am not making that last bit up. Whilst humorous it doesn't add anything to our understanding of her character or his relationship with her.There are brilliant moments in this film, but then somehow nothing quite happens with them. The Oleg (Terry Notary) character who does a kind of performance art which is mostly agressive passive and effects to cause both embarrasment and then fear at a dinner party, is excellent... at first. It spoils the scene by becoming and disturbingly an attempted rape scene. It would have been nice for the scene to have ended in a less predicatable way, as such this scene now just feels exploitative.The above scene points out the mix of the surreal, comic, serious, and occasionally uncomfortable viewing this fim provides. It becomes therefore a frustrating, and messy film. It jabs at the pretensions of the art world but then appears to make pretentious points about freedom of speech itself.There are always moments of interest in this film, especially when a kid accused by Claes Bang of being a theif (alongside many others via a letter drop), turns up. The kid is marvellously persistent and annoying and 'right' as well when it comes to his innocence.There are probably two major problems with this film. It's length at two and a half hours is far too long. At least half an hour could have been taken out and would have most likely improved the plotting. It would have forced Ostlund the director to decide on which storyline was the most important. This might have helped me (at least) understand the plot better and I think would have made for a better sharper film.The other problem is the characters are not likeable. It isn't always the case that characters need to be likeable, but you do need to empathise with their predicament. I didn't really care about Christian, and yet I think it was a fine performance by Claes Bang. I can't really explain that except the story was incoherent, and that must have become an alienating factor in wacthing his performance.There is an interesting subplot involving a viral campaign for the museum that goes horribly wrong. Yet it feels dislocated from the rest of the film which considering it's an art film about art feels really strange.

After this the protagonist ( a museum supervisor) tries to balance his career and allay the chaos he created to get back his belongings. Both branches have piquing incidents especially the fund raiser event with gorilla-man, the one shown in the poster. My god, I have seldom been uncomfortable to a degree that this act had invoked. Cinematography and music work in synergy to create a calm but instills trepidation. Movie is about art and itself proves to be an art. Acting by all the characters are close to perfect. Ending was abrupt as it usually is in these sort of films.Movie is awesome absolutely, but one can watch it once only.I suggest, watch it till it's fresh otherwise people have tendency to forget these and are rarely discussed during coffee breaks.",The Square
79,osmangokturk,a movie telling dynamic life of the modern man.,9,13 February 2020,"I like it and it is gripping.It genuinely traverse the hard contrasts in a modern rich and developed society. This movie is not about the emptiness that a modern rich man feels amid material abundance. On the contrary it shows the dynamicly fully flowing life that needs to be further fine-tuned using many contrasts.poor quarter is not depicted that much since the aim of the movie is not to show miseries but to show high scale life struggling for their own delicacy. a photo of misery would be used to show the satirical contrast, a beggar put as a watcher over luxury sales bags, our hero searching a note in the rubbish area.a sex scene is not used solely to show a passion or on the contrary to show impotence. it is used as something from the life, with its all relevant oddities, fear of being assessed as impotent or fear of leaving clues for blackmail.Somehow I was not able to place the scene of odd voiced gorilla shaped man in the movie. Maybe it is just about the timing of scene in the movie. you expect something that would be related to the scandal that had just started. I guess it was just one of the contrasts.",The Square
80,seriouscritic-42569,Welcome to the Jungle,7,13 May 2018,"A clever, and insightful, but somewhat meandering, social satire that, in hindsight, feels more like a series of vignettes loosely connected by the films protagonist, a well-known museum curator. The satirical sections that focus on the Modern Art world are dead on, although with, perhaps too much restraint. For the most part they are so understated you might find yourself wondering if the filmmakers were intentionally being satiric; except for, obviously, the film's high-point ""Welcome to the Jungle"" - both its most humorous and chilling sequence - which literally has a punchline at the end. It could easily be argued the film is worth watching for this section alone. Primarily concerned with how individuals interact with society and the world around them, scenes often play out with the camera focused on one character's reaction as opposed to the action, or conversation, occurring off-screen. This can be a disorienting choice, and, at times, confusing, yet undoubtedly all that is intentional. But be warned, the film will make no attempt to tie up all its lose ends: some characters just drop out of sight, storylines are left dangling and the movie just comes to a stop as opposed to having a real climax. You can be left feeling poked and prodded by the film for having watched it, as opposed to rewarded. But, hey, it's Art.",The Square

Not least, it evidently lies in the shadow of Haneke, winner of two recent Palmes for much better movies. The satire on the art world, the rattling of the bourgeoisie, both seem too overdrawn to be effective. Sketches go on too long, as when the museum director videos his apology, or the ape-man detonates the society party. Cutaways that don't happen, or do but are merely irritating, seem like unsuccessful adaptions of Haneke's grating style. A few folks left my screening up around the 90 minute mark, their patience evidently worn thin. They'd seen the best of it, like the director's fling with the journo. Now, if you really want to see someone stick it right up the bourgeoisie, you can't go past Haneke's mordant misbehaviour in Benny's Video (1992).",The Square

Like most satires, it is a film that simply sporadically presents a bunch of scenes, absent of context or relation to one another. They don't unify and create any particular unified message about the pretentiousness of the art world other than it's absurdity. However, the scenes, while having the capcity bizarre to the point of pointless boredom inducing, are believable. Instead of tearing down the pretentiousness of the art world it appears to beat the drum of it's own sense of depth and self-importance, thereby quickly becoming a very stale and uninteresting experience.",The Square

The acting is great, the film is incredibly well shot, and many pieces of intereseting social commentary are laced in throughout the film. The film manages to give off a very interesting tone, a mix of dark comedy, psychological horror, and drama. The film may run a little long with its 2 and a half hour run time, and some scenes and ideas feel unnecessary and are only brought up once in the film never to be explored again, yet this is still a great film and is one I would definitely reccomend, especially to those who were fans of Force Majeure.",The Square

89,SomeGuyName,"Timely social commentary, though not very entertaining",7,23 November 2017,"Major spoilers.I don't believe this movie to be a commentary on Swedish society only, but on society as a whole - at least, recent real life events mirrors those in the movie so well that I'd imagine it's themes are relevant everywhere. We follow Christian, an art curator who's the leader of a modern art museum that struggles at creating hype for it's new exhibition, The Square. He's arrogant and narcissistic, but not anymore so than any other person he meets. While everyone is in love with the idea of a loving society, none of them possess the empathy to demonstrate exactly that. Too caught up in their own dramas, they all do their best to avoid helping each other, thus creating situation after situation that snowballs out of control. Christian, especially, will be the victim of this. And living in a Nordic society, I can't get over how realistic some of the situations were; how people will not help those clearly in need, unless the victim(s) literally make too much of a fuss for the receiver to bear. There are several examples of this in the movie; Christian is not really worried when his children are fighting violently - he will only truly react when one of them slams the door. Or how a woman is quietly begging for help whilst she is being sexually assaulted during a piece of performance art - and everybody keeps their head down 'till she starts screaming loudly.Stuff like this all rang too true to me, and I see people do this every single day, albeit in more subtle ways. A weak example, but I think most people has overheard a conversation where someone is trying to say something, but because they aren't talking loudly enough - or aren't ""important"" - everyone pretends they didn't hear and keep cutting them off. It's a special, and sadly very prevalent, kind of narcissism; ""You didn't cry loud enough and/or are weak, thus I'm not obligated by society to help you - and I won't, even though I know in the back of my head that you are in pain"". This is the core of this movie, the message; we are just not that selfless or likely to even help someone, unless the person is either a) bothering us somehow by being in pain, or b) asking us loudly and directly, so that saying no will reflect badly on us. Thus, most people in this movie are clearly in pain, yet they only get help when they break the social contract. It goes both ways, but that doesn't prevent inequality to happen. According to this movie, the person of authority - or the power of the many - has more impact on people than truth or justice, so you better be born into privilege if an accident were to happen. But the homeless people staring into space on the streets, the problems of some kinds of political correctness, and the many immigrants in this movie are only a small part of this. Everyone suffers because of the narcissism of others. And yes, everybody lose. Watching it, I kept thinking ""Maybe a little misanthropic, an exaggeration of humanity's dark sides"". But then I thought of the recent sexual allegations against people in the entertainment industry. So many of them. And the most gruesome acts,(the pedophilia of Woody Allen, the rape of so many others) ignored, simply because it served the people surrounding them better at the moment. And now, everybody knows. Only now are they upset. How many times have similar things happened throughout history? How much of our conscience really comes from the inside?The strong message and it's great execution aside, this is not a perfect movie. I found it way too slow and drawn out in parts, and the repetitive music was annoying me to the extreme nearing the end. I liked the cinematography, and I loved the many metaphors. It had a consistent tone and some occasional humor(if you like it deadpan, and dry as a desert). It would've been completely mediocre, though, if it didn't make me think the way it did. It made me view all too common situations in a new light, and even though it's been several hours since I left my seat, I'm still depressed about it. All those hours people can spend in an art museum pretending to be aware, when this! This is what truly needs to change about humanity.

The same goes for the dashing and charming Claes Bang who really fills the screen in every scene he's in.Don't watch this film if you are easily bored, you need constant entertainment or you don't like to muse over meaning. It's a comedy, a drama and an artistic exploration all in one. An art curator in a high-art museum in Sweden faces the benefits and vices of his position. He is a public-facing persona, answerable to society, but is he answerable to himself?To me, it's a constant shift of power to the powerless and vice versa. Of the civilised to the uncivilised and vice versa. Who really are we in life, the mirage we display? Or the living person dealing with the raw and sometimes challenging realities. There are so many meanings in this, watch it to find your own interpretation.I love how Östlund wanted each scene to be stand alone, not contrived to carry the story but to raise a moment to ponder exactly what is going on, right now - bringing some immediacy and some 'now' in the film. It doesn't sound much but that's a pretty cool concept and approach considering our split attention and distraction led lives.

But the film ""The Square"" itself presents a (Swedish) society, that is far, far away from this utopia, almost the opposite. Östlund illustrates these abstract topics through dreamlike episodes from everyday life: The main protagonist becomes a victim of confidence men at the beginning, which triggers morally questionable actions by him and his friends, which result in other people losing their confidence in society, too.If you understood this, you have a chance at getting something out of this movie, but - be warned - it gets increasingly complicated and wild.It's also about the loss of trust between men and women, the borders of tolerance and inclusion in society, the stupidity of modern art, the mad cacophony of the media & the animalistic nature of man, who still might be only an advanced ape looking to find a better society to live in.Östlund uses episodes, metaphors and leitmotifs instead of a conventional plot, always dancing around his subjects in surprising ways, more like in a novel. The surrealistic touches, which often seem to come out of nowhere, because the film looks hyper-realistic most of the time, make the interpretation even more demanding, because everything we see could also be 'explained' as a nightmare by the hero. But even nightmares reflect our social reality in bizarre ways.Last but not least, 'The Square' is also the shape of the projected film in the cinema. You could interpret this as Östlund's way of saying, that cinema is one of the central social spaces where trust and community can be created today.I understand people, who don't like this movie or see it as flawed, but it works and is never boring. Maybe it's a little too simple in it's 'solution' for the difficult questions it asked at the beginning and maybe it doesn't end in a satisfying way and maybe it's too moralizing - but few films are this ambitious and demanding these days and that should be praised.I haven't seen such a film since Luis Bunuel's ""The Phantom of Liberty"" (1974), which is similar in satirical tone, realist style, episodic structure and surrealist approach. Another influence might be Roy Andersson's dry, comic surrealism, but it's still its own thing.It's too rich for one viewing. I need to see it again.",The Square

98,bricemavillaz,NOT a caricature or a parody : this movie tells it like it is,6,13 August 2021,"People who think this movie is exaggerated, people who think this movie is a satire should try and go to a contemporary art exhibition someday.If they have a couple of hours to waste.Unfortunately, nothing about this movie is satirical or cynical. Being from an art school, I can confirm this movie really tells it like it is. Having been forcibly dragged to countless exhibitions, I quickly realize this bunch of posh herd is only here for the free booze, the free canapés, but MOSTLY to show their faces. I quit this world altogether when I realized it had nothing to do with genuine talent, hard work, inspiration, and everything to do with superficiality, egotism big bucks and self-obsession.Welcome to the world of appearances and utter superficiality, welcome to the world of make-believe, welcome to the world of pathologic selfishness and narcissism.Everyone gets nailed in this movie : the naive inconsistent curators who barely understand the BS that comes out of their mouths, the incompetent, coke fueled communication team that doesn't have a clue what its doing and resorts to the laziest shock value schlock to pass their ""message"", the pseudo-intellectual BS artists who listen to themselves talk spewing their indigestible mess of jargon, the crowds of bewildered, bored morons that stare at these people with fake looks of admiration on their mugs pretending they understand what he's talking about, the emptiness, the pointlessness of this world that glorifies superficiality as if it were a virtue.The protagonist is clueless and lost during the whole film, self obsessed with his little rich man problems, all the while spelling wise about altruism and solidarity, gradually painting himself in a corner through his own carelessness, stupidity and egotism.Every initiative he takes catastrophically backfires, painting the portrait of an overpaid, overprivileged, self-absorbed idiot who can't seem to be capable of critical thinking, who is in way over his head and who lost control and barely understands the world that made him rich in the first place.Perhaps because there's nothing to understand about the contemporary art world. Just a bunch of obscenely rich, bored, empty people that don't know what to do with their money, so they blow it all on ugly canvases ""painted"" by the latest popular ""artist"" to appear sophisticated and cultured, when they barely even know or care what they bought is supposed to represent. The kind of people who show up in ""installations"" of ""happenings"" just to say they were there, that frequent museums just to pass off as sophisticated people.You know what I'm talking about, everyone at least once ran into these ridiculous, self-absorbed, overprivileged pompous empty shells that systematically p1ss the hell out of everyone with their unbearable make pretend behaviors and the obnoxious unwarranted pretentiousness that oozes from every one of their pores.It's about high time this clique of unproductive, lazy, despicable egotists had their noses rubbed in their own filth, and the director certainly achieved the objective : seeing how EVERY artsy fartsy, pretentious publication (that are equally guilty of all the crimes this review has pointed out so far) absolutely HATED the film, he clearly hit right where it hurts.So how does it feel to be called out for your despicable charades, your lies, your unacceptable behavior, rich white people ?Thought no one figured out what was really going on ?Turns out the pleb is not as stupid as you think, and this film makes sure all these overprivileged, spoiled, unworthy vermin know everyone caught up with their BS.Granted, the movie IS overlong and could have been 40mns shorter, but one can't help but think this is done on purpose : after all, this movie is about a bunch of totally disconnected elites that spend hours upon hours talking about nothing with 5 syllable words to sound smart, masturbating over the utter void that is their existence.The choice of music equally feels like a hidden message : the band justice is brought up more than a couple of times, and is known mostly for being a poor man's daft punk that exploited the ""french touch"" scene for quick bucks and celebrity. As of today, this band of merry frauds has completely vanished, and barely anyone plays their songs or talk about them anymore.Just another instance of opportunistic pseudo artists in it for the fame and the money that mask their utter lack of talent, creativity or involvement with smug attitudes, arrogant posturing and ridiculous, meaningless jargon. The ""mouthed"" main theme itself soon becomes annoying and obnoxious, itself being another example of pointless, uninteresting fluff, pushed to the thresholds of ridiculousness by people so divorced from reality they don't even realize how laughable their ""art"" has become.I watched this movie after I read a piece that called BS on the whole contemporary art world and told everything like it really is. That's exactly what this movie does.However absurd or exaggerated this movie might seem, always keep in mind that these people DO exist, and none of their behaviors in the movie are exaggerated or blown out of proportion. THIS IS WHAT THE ""ELITE"" WORLD OF ARTS REALLY IS.A scandalous bunch of idle, bored, spoiled, jaded, dead inside people that care about nothing but themselves, but yet are never condemned by their unacceptable, absurd, antisocial and selfish behaviors. A bunch of millionaires that contribute to nothing in society, a clear-cut case of utterly useless people that we dare call ""the elite"".This film knocks them square in the teeth, and to me, it's totally deserved, to me, that's a 6.Because it IS ultimately a little boring and pointless. But the subject itself is boring and pointless : truth be told, there's nothing to talk about when it comes to the deceitful and utterly shallow world of contemporary art : just a bunch of rich nobodies that love to hear themselves talk about nothing in particular.

Outstanding performance by Terry Notary is out of this world. Not aware of his track record, I was convinced he was more than ""just an actor""- absolutely brilliant.For viewers, this movie is about so much more than what is shown on screen. The movie makes the viewer laugh, nod and agree to many reactions in the movie, or feel ashamed, appalled or disgusted, all depending on the viewers own personal experience and beliefs.The best part about the movie is the statuses where reactions depends on two mindsets:1. Mindset is open for experiencing discomfort (location: museum, art exhibition) 2. Mindset is in default mode. Probability of feeling discomfort = higher. Curious to know why the Writer and Director, Ruben Östlund decided to name the movie: ""the square"". He could equally have called it: ""the circle"", or the ""comfort zone"" or Swedish: ""obehag"".

After the long, slow fascination of Force Majeure it seemed a safe bet to follow him anywhere - maybe not. The Square is not well written, ponderously executed and full of the type of stale assaults on modern preoccupations that Woody Allen was tossing off in the 70's. Tighter editing (by about an hour of running time) might have helped to sharpen the point that people nurture misery by acting like nothing terrible is happening, but maybe he should have given this one a pass. One could almost imagine that the main character's rise to prominence was because he's so damn pretty, but the blandly stupid decisions he makes are not credible for a successful adult in a highly competitive field. Neither is the resolution of the main set piece - the apeman's performance piece at the donor dinner - initially fascinating but unravels with poorly conceived violence that sort of ruins the moment. The actors are more than competent but the filmmakers can't bring Claes Bang's Magnetic Everydope to life, though the camera just lingers and lingers and lingers and lingers, while the background intrusions annoy/provoke/unsettle to no particular effect.

Christian manage a museum and launching a new show called the square but his attitude toward community changes from this simple situation and he starts acting like an animal if he already doesn't have some animal needs like sex without no feelings and in between scenes of Christian we see scenes for beggars in the streets like the one we see in our everyday life telling us that those people are not doing any good for our community. Cant forget the director decision making in some scenes like ignoring to use wide shots to show us whats happening in a situation but he prefers to focus on the important actor expressions so we can feel more than to see a situation. In the museum a lot of subtexts and massages like a piles of dirt and an old security female watching the room where a huge bold sign says YOU ARE NOTHING and no one actually want to enter this room which is a massage for all of us as humans – do good to your community cause at the end you will die and nobody will remember you and another room which is all about trust, like how could we trust each other if we couldn't stand for each other. In Social media people will only notice you if you you did a bloody and dark videos and its shown in the marketing campaign of the square show in the movie. Cant forget the amazing performance of everyone in the movie even the chimpanzee and the dog. We know chimpanzees are the closest to human behavior which lead us to one of best scenes I have ever seen, it act like the link between the whole story and the massage given to audiences (shown in the movie poster) and also reflecting an important question ""what we should do if someone threatens our community, should we act like animals in these case or go blind and say we are civilized"" this is the sarcastic view of the movie. The most important question we should look for doesn't concern us but concern future generations where its shown in the form of Christian two little daughters and the way they fight with each other and what we do in front of them that shapes there attitude towards community. ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations"" Christian words in the first half of the movie and in the other half he beats a young boy and searches in the garbage bin and do sex because he is horny just like an animal. Its a universal movie that will let you link and think about things happening around you in a different way and that's why its a Palm Doir winner.",The Square

Anyway, there's this guy in the audience. His mission is to express the unique possibilities for what we really feel about these types of situations. Needless to say, he is ignored, even though he cannot be ignored. The whole thing was like Gregory Corso protesting what he felt to be bad poetry St. Mark's Church back in Greenwich Village long ago, back in the sixties. Or maybe the raunch and roll early seventies. The heyday Jodorowsky and Hunter Thompson. In fact, the rhythm of the dialog - the progression of the plot - et al., is reminiscent of that most famous of all Lenny Bruce jokes: ""I offer your honor. I honor your offer. And that's the way it went for the rest of the night, your honor. Off her. On her. Off her. On her. Off her. On her..."" ad infinitum.
Only it is clear is becoming eminently clear to the post modern audience, long, short, or doomsday clock aficionados that we are well advanced into the final hours and time is running out.
The viewers of the film sitting near, mostly sweet young millennial thangs, were somewhat upset with me for laughing that loud, that hard, and that long. And that's the way the showing went with about half the audience laughing at each turn, every so many beats if you will, and not always the same half (accept the ambiguity if you please). The film, among its other virtues, is high comedy, far and away the best I've seen in that beleaguered genre in years.
The film is brilliantly directed - top level - and Ostlund has established himself as a top shelf director of the new generation, with Zvyagintsev and very few others with this seering social commentary which speaks with tongues of fire from the screen. Much like Memento, this film plays out on the level of pure philosophic argument in its endgame, and I predict will make a good showing on DVD as a cult classic, esp., here in the USA. Unfortunately, we may not have time for that since abiding by the simple guidelines adumbrated by the suare seems such a difficult task.",The Square

If you expect a straight storyline, you will be disappointed; the narrative is as inconsistent and fragmented as the human psyche and the societal aspects which it brushes in an unpretentious manner. The highly renowned and controversial dinner scene is perhaps one of the bravest experiments in the genre, and is, undoubtedly, the highlight of the movie.
The Square may be considered satirical, bizarre, and hilarious at times - but it would be to misleading to call it a comedy.

121,Jesse_Ung,"A strange, uncomfortable and fascinating look at society",8,20 July 2017,"This is a hard film to describe and an even harder film to review but I'm going to try my best to express how I felt about it. In an attempt to put it simply, The Square follows a modern art museum curator named Christian (played by Claes Bang), and some increasingly strange experiences which shape his views and understandings of the world he lives in and the people around him. I had the chance to see this film on opening night at the New Zealand International Film Festival, and I am so glad I did. The Square plays like an increasingly bizarre farce, and while the film is indeed very funny (sometimes in shocking ways) it provides a consistently fascinating look at our behavior as people in society. Now I realize that isn't necessarily innovative for a film in 2017, but that said, The Square dares to pose increasingly uncomfortable questions to its audience.From the inherent narcissism of even the most ordinary of people, to the shallowness of popular culture, to the complex behaviors and interactions between people of disparate backgrounds. Again, these ideas are not necessarily novel, but the film presents them in a way that is consistently entertaining - even when certain exchanges on- screen are uncomfortable. There is a scene that takes place at a gathering of elite artists and sponsors that is as squirm-inducing as anything I've seen all year. I also must point out the constant use of dead-pan humor with verbal and visual gags throughout as one of the film's secret weapons.I would warn that this is not a film for everyone. The pacing is uneven, the structure is unusual, and there isn't a whole lot of forward momentum to propel the film forward. But, if you are willing to meet the film halfway, I think you're in for a fascinating, shocking, hilarious and uncomfortable (skewered) mirror into the society we live in.",The Square
122,Polar-Night,"Seriously, this has won the Palme d'Or?",5,24 September 2017,"I watched ""The Square"" at the Helsinki Film Festival today. The cast sounded great to me and since it has won the Palme d'Or, I was sure of being up for a treat. However, I waited...waited and waited. 150 minutes passed by and I could not get what I craved for. The social satire felt incomplete and too forced in some scenes, as having too many scenes with beggars, baby cries, noises, dogs barking, phone ringing etc. There could have been so much more. It just repeats itself over and over again.Moreover, I think it is a humiliation for local actors to be excluded from international posters and replaced by supporting actors like Elisabeth Moss and Dominic West. Also, their fans might be seeking ways to watch this movie although they do not have many scenes and would be thus disappointed. I surely wanted more scenes with Moss, I think she is a terrific actress and her character adds so much colour and vividness to the bleak movie. West is also great, as usual. Claes Bang is capable of leading the movie, he is quite interesting in his manners and glances and makes it easy to tirelessly follow him for 2 1/2 hrs. I like Scandinavian movies and I'm used to their black and bizarre humour, however, I perceived this movie as a modern action movie in comparison to the more calm, dialogue-driven, philosophical and satirical Scandinavian movies. Östlund did not convince me as a clever screenwriter, but his directing is good - as far as the poor screenplay allows it to be.",The Square
123,christinemsky,Satire to Bourgeoisie and Portrait of Societal Problems - An Analysis,8,24 January 2018,"The Square (Ruben Östlund, 2017) brilliantly uses a conventional tool to portray the hypocrites. But there are also some creative details in expressing satire and relatively innovative ideas, such as the hero was not the direct initiator but more like a victim for the accident about the video. The video accident is more like a complementary element for the hero, a cursor at an art museum, Christian, and it is also point out the seriousness of the estrangement between the societal hierarchy on the mental, sometimes unconscious level. It generates the completion of the character arc. 
 The speech and resignment on the press conference is brilliantly designed. After all his announcement, the businesswoman ""saved"" him from the press by propagating the exhibition. This explicit irony revealed the unscrupulousness of materialistic capitalists further than the decision of making a cruel, unethical video for propaganda use.
 Another storyline of Christian except his business in museum exhibition is the theft. The plots reach a climax when Christian pushed the boy and then repeatedly heard a voice saying ""help"". We see how he hesitates about whether to make amendment. Finally, he searched for the boy's phone in the garbage disposal cart and recorded a video to apologize and explain. His act of carelessness about the so-called decency marked the transition point as his realization on the societal problem later on mentioned in the video referring to personal expectation and impression about the others. I am not satisfied with the character's lines explicitly tell the audience about his former bias on the boy and his family, or extended to general people in the social class below him. From my own perspective, those excessive explanations diegetically to the boy but actually designed for audiences somehow ruined the polysemy. Besides, there is a plot that the character asked the beggar to whom he formerly refused to give cash to help him watch over things when he looks for his daughters. Christian's helplessness when asking help from other walkers-by who seems in the same social class (we assume that does exist in the film) as him, in contrast to the last resolution from the beggar, already conveyed the things in his explanation in a cliched and implicit way. 
On the other hand, the ultimate unresolved regret is an reinforcement to the inevitability of estrangement. It seems dramatized that the boy and his family moved when the character finally decide to do things physically for amendment, more precisely, self-amendment. This failure settle the tune of this film as some kind of desperation, not only about the long-lasting estrangement itself, but also the powerlessness of individuals under such unequal societal context.
 It is hard to forget the scene in the flamboyant hall when Oleg, the primitive man, ""punished"" those capitalists, or to say, middle and upper class people. Oleg's identity remains a mystery throughout the film, whether his a trained actor to perform in the art museum for entertainment or some abandoned baby raised by wolves. The blank left in this background is a rather great choice to give prominence to Christian, and this appropriate omission can also be found on the other characters in this film. Oleg's wilder behaviors, if related to those several images of him on a screen which seems from some monitor recording his status under training, are primeval abreactions through anger and violence. Another satire follows those plots referring to the well-dressed men's reactions. We can notice that when a man a teased and made fun of, others just remain sitting and make fun of this clownish scene. There is also no one reacting when Oleg jumped between and on the tables, destroying things. Only when a rape is about to happen that people start to literally do something. They rushed to the spot together, never seems more collaborative, hitting Oleg. The whole sequence reminds me of some contemporary phenomena that when some immoral things takes place, only when there is one person stands out that some people will have the bravery to show their standpoint - they do the thing mostly because there is this first person to be the scapegoat, or merely for some opinion that penalty will not be applied to massive people. In addition, there is this detail of diegetic sound. The content of the voice-over to the video shown in the hall is under delicate design.""The hunting eagerness is triggered by weakness."" ""If you try to escape, the animal will hunt you down. But if you remain absolutely still without moving a muscle, the animal might not notice you, and you can hide in the herd, safe in the knowledge that someone else will be the prey."" They are metaphors to the contemporary societal circumstances. In the specific case of this film, the ""prey"" is both the bourgeoisie and the homeless relatively, according to the stereotypical impression and negative expectation mutually. The former quote is the discrimination as they view one another as an inferior community; the second is partially explaining why the estrangement becomes inevitable and long-lasting. From the beginning of the film, we can see a sequence long shots of beggars, and similar shots appear again throughout the film. When the voice-over is reading those sentences, the camera is shooting those decent, well-dressed people sitting there without any facial expressions. Such indifference corresponds to the pedestrians' in the shots of beggars on the streets, thus reinforcing the sympathetic, helpless situations. And somehow Oleg's vengeance suddenly contains a sense of fulfilment and achievement when attached to the trigger as such indifference.
 The formal elements in the film is also well utilized, especially the sound. There are a lot of noise used in sound mixing, including baby's cryings and the annoying sounds from construction or collision. It is not hard to notice during the watching experience that the hero is often interrupted by some noise when he tries to answer a question or make an explanation. The casual noise seems purposely taking away his chance to speak. Such details are likely to establish the oppressed emotions inside this character, providing reasons to his unconventional choice of sending out letters after being robbed or being occasionally hysterical in the rest of the film.
 ""The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."" The explicit satire in this film points to the title of the film. What the square is supposed to be, or imagined to be, in contrast to the accidents and regrets, is making this film both enjoyable and worthy in its afterlife. On the one hand, we shall pay attention to the social problem it highlighted as the practical value developed from this film. On the other hand, taking the perspective of film as an art, both thematic and formal elements are well arranged and integrated. Besides, relating to the contemporary period as the award season, I look forward to the credits that are given to this film, although the awards are such minor things to consider in regards to arts.",The Square

125,kyanberu,Satirizing the Cultural Elite,8,22 November 2017,"Director Ruben Ostland has followed up his 2014 Golden Globe nominee Force Majeure with Cannes Palme d'Or winner The Square. The film is both a satire of the cultural elite of Stockholm and a sad commentary about the separation between individuals both within circles and between circles. The lead character, Christian (Claes Bang), is the curator of a museum of modern art that seeks to draw attention and donors through avant-garde exhibits and over-the-edge social media campaigns. The film follows Christian through a few weeks of his life when one of the hot new exhibits is ""The Square"", an actual square in the museum courtyard that is meant to be ""a sanctuary of trust and caring."" But rather than show trust and caring, the movie The Square raises a number of troubling questions: How thin is the veneer of civilization? Can political correctness substitute for empathy? Is art whatever a curator chooses to put in an art museum? And enveloping these questions is the separation of the circle of Stockholm's cultural elites from the City's homeless and immigrant population, as well as the separation of individuals within the City's cultural elite. One set piece in particular portrays the inability of the Stockholm's elite to communicate on a human level: It is Christian's meeting with Anne (Elisabeth Moss), a publicist, the day after a night of sex—and a bizarre argument over what to do with a used condom. In this scene Christian is totally unable to say the needed words about what had happened between them. (Anne, an American, comes across as much more able to relate to others than any of the Swedes in the movie.) Another memorable scene is the one in which a banquet for museum donors is interrupted when the performer (Terry Notary), playing an ape, goes out of control. The diners, who are initially frozen by their need for decorum, or perhaps by their need to display political correctness, ultimately go ape themselves. Perhaps not a total surprise since the same donor diners had earlier stampeded their way to a luncheon in a lighter scene. There are many sub-plots in the film—some satirizing interactions within Stockholm's upper class, others between classes— perhaps leaving some viewers displeased by the way the film jumps without warning from one set piece to another. Others may dislike long stretches of art-film inactivity in many of the episodes—something that explains why the movie lasts for 2 hours and 22 minutes. Nevertheless, The Square does capture the alienation of modern society, and does it with plenty of dark humor.",The Square

When an avalanche hits a ski resort, a man flees leaving his wife and children behind and that sets in motion a series of events that made a pretty effective and darkly comical family drama. But in his latest film, Östlund has more ambitious plans; This time he wants to show us all things that are wrong in the Swedish modern society and presumably by extension the whole Western world. In this crusade, he touches on our indifference about marginalized people, modern art, millennials, our obsession with safe spaces, sexual politics, parenting and the list is long but behind all of that there seems to be a similar lament: people has lost the courage to stand up for themselves and others. Cowardice is the modern world's biggest sin.Whether Östlund is up to anything with his grand theory of everything is up for debate, but what is interesting is that the Cannes festival organizers eager to find a prognosis for the apparent malaise of their continent, decided to overlook the often didactic tone of The Square and reward it with their highest prize.",The Square

146,dutramatheus-78675,A masterfully executed mess.,6,31 October 2019,"The Square felt like a loose collection of vignettes or short films which do not fit together into a holistic, cohesive whole. The film has no plot and hardly any character development or resolution, and the themes it deals with are all over the place and not in any way connected, defying any attempt at making sense. However, Ruben Ostlund's great direction and the very talented actors elevate the poor writing. These non-sequitur short stories are all very well shot and acted, and some are truly great, displaying a masterful use of humor and tension.In a way this film reminded me of Under the Silver Lake, a recent film which quickly turned into one of my favourites of all time. Both films are nonsensical, ambitious and well above two hours long, but the main difference between the two is that Under the Silver Lake had a plot and a satisfying conclusion and, most importantly, was tremendously fun to watch. The Square fails at any of this, making it a frustrating watch.What surprised me, however, was the reception this had at Cannes when compared to Under the Silver Lake. Maybe it has to do with the fact that this film deals with a stylish, handsome art curator in a sophisticated setting, while Under the Silver Lake depicts a deadbeat child-beater interacting with people who are either desperate, stupid, or evil. Maybe Under the Silver Lake was too much for the Cannes audience, watching in their fancy tuxedos or whatever.",The Square

That is why the camera does not move much and scenes take longer than most people are willing to tolerate.

The audience laughed (yes, laughed) constantly throughout and gave the film a solid round of applause at the end (a rare event in my experience). What looked on paper like a 140-minute high-conceit skewering of artistic pretension ended up as a delightful comedy of modern manners with little overt political agenda. The fact that most of the plot lines are left unresolved would normally confound an audience, but even this ends up feeling natural. There are a couple of spectacular camera moves (the ""Vertigo""reference in particular) and the poster set-piece with the ""ape"" is, for my money, even more tense and thrilling than the avalanche sequence from the same director's ""Force Majeure"" (which some critics are calling superior, but I beg to differ).

Things were happening for no reason. No reason at all.
For instance, the lead actor is the leader of the marketing department or something like that at a museum, so we think this is clever/intelligent/.., he has some skills or at least common thinking. He got robbed, but he did not go to a police department. He finds his friend idea brilliant to track his cell, finds where that ""bad ass"" guy lives and drops scary letters to every flat at that building (13 floors).
He tries to conceal himself but he visits that area with his tesla. REALLY? How many people in Sweden- if not mistaken- drive (a damaged) tesla?
At the end, you feel like a looser in every aspect (money, time, etc).

Writer/Director Ruben Östlund seems in love with his ideas that he didn't even bother to incorporate them in a proper screenplay. He fires one after another at will. To be fair the film is perfectly stylized and very well directed. It delivers in arguably the most important criterias to win a Palme d'Or but widely misses a chance to be a film to be remembered. Its greatest mistake is literally vocalising so many ideas through the characters' speeches while a film's true purpose should be creating these ideas in the viewer's mind.,The Square

Someone in the street is asking for help and all the people pass by.
A museum needs advertising and a company is trying to help with a video which causes a mess and is scary.
An artist is trying to act the way he thinks is artistic and it turns out to be a disaster.
Another artist creates an exposition and it is misplaced, but it really does not matter. May be because there is no message in it?
So? 
How do we talk? Do we always get answers to our questions? Do we need answers to our questions if we do not listen to the answers?
Can we talk in private and not become (mis)communicators of some trivial ideas?
This movie is a great food for thought. This movie deserves Oscar.

168,milanbilan-51114,A very western European Satire and universal Metaphor,7,24 January 2018,"If you live in a advanced western European country you will be much more able to appreciate the satire of The Square. The subtle racism ingrained in the culture is very different than the racial tensions and issues in the US. A few decades ago the ""dark people"" of southern and eastern Europe were looked down upon in western Europe, then migrations brought in even ""darker people."" The disconnect between the lofty ideals of western European advanced social democracies and their privileged classes, and the realities of these ""other"" people moving in became more apparent.The art scene becomes a ripe metaphor for this disconnect from reality that it portends to represent, or at least, reflect upon. It's all become about money, privilege, and, yes, ludicrous social media bytes. The Square is certainly not a perfect film, but it portrays well the uneasiness of how the privileged class tries to handle this unavoidable reality in a clumsy way, without really understanding or addressing any of the real underlying issues. In the most memorable scene, when confronted with the absurdist excess of the performance artist challenging them, they choose to ignore it as long as they can, and when they can't any more, they clobber him almost to death. Underlying it all is how we see each other as human beings beyond our classifications (if we can), and what we do to each other on a personal level; a good piece of cinema.
It's also worth noting that Swedish projects look damn neat.",The Square

If you are on the fence about watching The Square, here are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, you don't just watch The Square, you experience The Square. All 2 hours and 22 minutes of it, this movie is looong. The first half of the movie is brilliant and creative, in the second half you just get run over by Ruben Östlunds full force of artistic fury. Yes this movie is artsy, super artsy. If you are a fan of modern art then this is the movie for you, you will experience some of the most powerful artistic scenes in modern movie history. second, this movie does not give a f**k about your feelings, The Square is not created for the plot, the movie is created to deliver a message. When the movie is finished the employees of the cinema you will be visiting won't have to clean up leftover popcorn from the floor, they will be scraping your jaws from it.My girlfriend was crying on the way home after watching this, not because it is heartbreaking but because she had trouble processing what she just had experienced.There you have it, I hope that a few of you have second thoughts about watching the movie now and that the rest of you can't wait to get hold of a ticket!Fred out",The Square
170,toharshjain,As confusing as the society and therefore very real,8,13 May 2018,"It is basically a very realistic look at how things would happen. The director has a choice of scenes from the general story he's aiming at. And it is the slow realism that makes the scenes funny as well as connectable. If you can't connect with it in depth, you won't like it. I watched it in theater once and at home once and the feel was totally different in the two cases.
The vision of the movie seems conflicted and confused at times. But I guess it is because the director is not working towards a plot, but showing society which is probably mostly just as confused.

Erika8926 December 2017
But my own is here:One of the worst film I ever ever have seen. Fine the first 20-30 min. But of course it does descripe the Swedish social uncritical sociaty in real (I have lived in Sweden in 30years). 7-8stars att the first 30min. Then junk and in the same track how many, not all imigrant do behave,,,,,to loooong sceens. That film gave me nothing,,, nothing but junk and heartbeat that I do not wish to se in a cinema. But yes Sweden have huge problems,,,, and have been able to damage Denmark and Norway (+eu) spreding they ""human ape-culture"". I now change this to one from two stars becaurse of uncritical reviews with 10 stars, where they partner have to leave,,,they must be totaly insane!! If I had a chance and could get my money back I would try,,,,, But if you want to see how normaly life and lifeview is in Sweden then go and see it.
Ohh today my mother told me she would give the film 0 stars,,,, the second worst film she had seen in her life. And she say she is a little worried for the thinking of new generation for them witch liked this film. Thinking zerro,,,,,,,,
We went to see Churchils Darkest Hours,,trying to forget this film(I could not sleep this night, it just got me pissed of),,,, but that was a great film. 
 I will postulate that that Swedish sofly culture wiev and own lost of control, has been a lot of problem for ohters countries in EU and indirecte helping pushing GB to Brexit and geting a feeling of unsecure i Skandinavia. That is sad. real sad. So I do not need to see a looooooooong meaningless film about dayly life in Sweden with no proudness at all, but just about trying telling us about the apeman in an apeland. Do not waste your time on this film.
After 3. day I am still angry how they can make such wasting-time-film-and-no-meaning-film. I do understand how a girlfriend could cry to destroy just some expetations when you heard about a film. This is a Drama/dokument film. Nothing more or less.",The Square
