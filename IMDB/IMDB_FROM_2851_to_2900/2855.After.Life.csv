0,Leofwine_draca,Annoyingly ambiguous,4,4 October 2015,"There's a semi-decent premise lurking somewhere in the depths of AFTER.LIFE but unfortunately it never really rises to the fore. Instead what we're left with is an entirely nondescript film in which very little happens indeed. There's a lot of mood stuff, a lot of atmosphere setting, and plenty of plot points which end up going nowhere, but as a film, AFTER.LIFE is a disappointment.The acceptable Christina Ricci stars as a young woman involved in a car accident who wakes up on a mortuary table, being attended to by the sinister Liam Neeson. Now, is she really dead and unable to accept the truth about her condition, or is Neeson a psychotic serial killer who enjoys making his victims think they've reached the afterlife? The film never really tells you which is true, providing enough evidence to support either explanation, and by the end you don't really care anyway.Ricci is quite good in this film although not as good as she's been elsewhere, like BLACK SNAKE MOAN. To be fair, she doesn't have much to do other than wander around nude. Neeson plays it deadpan throughout and doesn't have a great deal to do either; you can tell this film was shot in just a few days. Justin Long, as the frustrated boyfriend, feels weak and out of his depth. AFTER.LIFE is more of an insipid mystery than a real horror film, and as such it's not really worth your time; the lack of explanation makes it an all-too-frustrating watch.",After.Life
1,SnoopyStyle,great premise with potential,5,20 April 2016,"School teacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) and her boyfriend Paul Coleman (Justin Long) are having relationship problems. Anna gets into a car accident and wakes up on the preparation table of funeral director Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson). Deacon tells her that she's dead. She's confused and wonders if she's in a ghostly transitional place.This movie has a great premise with horror potential. However, it's more interested in a naked Ricci than building a horror movie. It has some creepy atmosphere but it fails to do anything with it. The ending lacks power. The twists lack intensity. The writers need to come up with some more twists and probably some action to take this great premise to the next level.",After.Life
2,claudio_carvalho,Terrific Bleak Tale,8,8 August 2010,"The school teacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) is a troubled woman that uses many pills along the day and is incapable to love due to the creation of her dysfunctional mother. When her boyfriend Paul Coleman (Justin Long) is promoted but needs to move to Chicago, he invites her to a fancy dinner to propose her. However Anna does not listen to him and believes he wants to quit their relationship, leaving the restaurant totally disturbed and upset. She has a car accident and awakes in a funeral home, where the director Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) is preparing her body for the funeral service. Anna tells him that she is not dead, but Eliot shows her death certificate and explains that he has the gift of listening to the dead. Along the days and the nights, Anna faces her fears and Eliot slowly tries to convince her to accept her death. But Anna does not believe that she had died and tries to communicate with Paul. Is she really dead or alive?""After.Live"" is a terrific bleak tale and one of the best horror movies that I have recently seen. The ambiguous story provided leads to the viewer to decide whether Anna Taylor is dead or alive but the conclusion is actually open to interpretation. Liam Neeson and Christina Ricci totally or partially naked most of the time have top-notch performances, supported by an intelligent and original screenplay, tight direction and awesome music score. The atmosphere is melancholic, and the dark colors are contrasted by the red of blood, hair dye and dress. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",After.Life
3,lee_eisenberg,"""The Addams Family"" meets ""Schindler's List"" meets ""Jeepers Creepers"" meets ""Angela's Ashes"" meets ""Ghostbusters""",5,20 May 2015,"As it's own story, I like Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo's ""After.Life"". As a movie, not as much. Both Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson put on great performances: her Anna sinks into confusion about her life (or death?), while his Eliot comes across as the typical guy whose nice demeanor might be hiding something. The rest of the cast doesn't equal them, and despite the unique plot, much of the movie seems like stuff that I've seen before.And then there's the cast, or what it implies. Despite Ricci's versatile career, I still remember her as Wednesday Addams. Liam Neeson used to be known for serious roles - Oskar Schindler and Jean Valjean - but now stars in a bunch of dumb action flicks. I don't know if Justin Long has a most famous role, but I always remember him from ""Jeepers Creepers"". Malachy McCourt is the brother of ""Angela's Ashes"" author Frank McCourt, and ran for governor of New York on the Green Party ticket in 2006. And then there's Alice Drummond, who's played supporting roles in a variety of movies (""Ghostbusters"", ""Awakenings"", ""In & Out"", ""Doubt"", to name just a few).So, it's an OK, not great movie.",After.Life
4,paul_haakonsen,A thrilling ride of suspense and guessing,7,16 January 2011,"""After.Life"" is a really intense thriller that will keep you in the dark, feeding you just small pieces to keep you guessing and speculating. And that worked so well.The story told in ""After.Life"" is really riveting and compelling. It is the type of story that will keep you in suspense and wanting to see what happens next. The plot is Anna Taylor (played by Christina Ricci) is in a car accident and wakes up on a mortuary slab, where she is attended to by Eliot Deacon (played by Liam Neeson). And the story lets you guessing if she really is dead or alive, and whether it is all a ruse set up by Deacon. I am not going to reveal any more of the story, except that it was fantastic.I like movies that keep you in the dark and have you grasping at clues, trying to figure out what really is happening. And ""After.Life"" really takes you on a thrill ride where you don't know what is true or false.The cast was really good and they did good jobs with their roles. Especially Liam Neeson, in the role of the mortician Eliot Deacon. He was right on the money with this performance. I read that they had initially casted Alfred Molina for this part, and I think he would have done an equally good job (as he has been seen in a mortician role before). And also Christina Ricci was doing a good job with her role as Anna Taylor. And it is good to see that Justin Long is finally shedding that teenage role of his and stepping up into the bigger league of acting.If you like thrillers, then ""After.Life"" is definitely worth checking out. The story blew me away and took me completely off guard. I hadn't expected it to be anything like this.",After.Life
5,sunwarrior13,A Hypnotic Tale About Death,8,7 March 2021,"""After.Life"" is a movie starring Liam Neeson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Long that deals with the process of death. This film written by Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo, Paul Vosloo, Jakub Korolczuk and directed by Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo tells the story of a school teacher,who dies on a car accident after she got upset when her boyfriend was about move to Chicago. After the accident, she wakes up facing a mortician in Eliot Deacon at a mortuary.The film deals with the five process of death from denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. During these process, we get to scenes go through between the school teacher and the mortician as well as the former's relatives from her boyfriend, her mother, and her student. We get to see how the school teacher initially denies death and the anger that she feels especially with the possible sadness that the people close to her may feel. But as she goes through this, the mortician makes an effort to accept that her life has ended and to accept the fact that everyone's life ends. Then we get to see her once again tries to bargain about being still alive and the depression she obtains when she finally realized that her life has ended until the conclusion wherein she looks great which signifies that she has accepted her fate that her life has truly ended.The movie is good enough considering it presents a hypnotic tale about death and the emotions the person as well as the person's relatives may feel during that event. The acting is commendable particularly Ricci and Neeson particularly their exchange of words as the school teacher and the mortician respectively.Overall,this is a good film that would interest the viewer and it deserves a better rating that it currently has at IMDB.",After.Life
6,Scarecrow-88,After.Life,7,8 August 2010,"The dead often speak to us in different ways.AFTER.LIFE concerns, we assume, a dead young woman, a school teacher, who debates with a mortician over whether or not she is indeed deceased as he prepares her for her own funeral. Director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo fashions quite a morbid tale about the importance of appreciating life when faced with the imminent approach of death. Is Anna(Christina Ricci)in that state between life and death or is the mortician, Eliot Deacon(a creepy Liam Neeson), harbouring sinister secrets?Justin Long is Paul Coleman, a promising lawyer who was Anna's boyfriend. Paul wants to see Anna one last time before her funeral, yet Eliot insists he can not due to his not being a member of the immediate family. Paul, however, has convinced himself(with help from a child student of Anna's, Jack, portrayed by Chandler Canterbury)that Anna may in fact be alive and will attempt to ""save her"" without much help. I would suggest, if you do not want all the answers, to avoid the DVD interview with Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo because she pretty much tells everything. But, she certainly cast plenty of doubt Eliot's direction; he seems suspicious enough. What we see happening as Jack starts attending funerals and talking with Eliot is the possible ""indoctrination"" of another into the fold..Jack might have the same ""gift"" Eliot has. Or does he? Lots of questions arise as to whether or not Eliot can speak with the dead or if he's simply not who he says he is. Ricci spends a lot of time either naked or in a red nightie so those who wish to see AFTER.LIFE just to get their rocks off will have plenty of motivation to do so. There are long, lingering shots of Ricci, even if she carries an appearance of someone who had recently died(there are signs she might be ""held hostage"" through psychological means), her naked body's form is positively beautiful.Long gives a strong performance as a desperate man who alienates those around him because he wishes to convince someone Anna might be alive and in need of assistance, with the obvious reaction of ""you need to let go and accept her passing"" from those who know him.I imagine Neeson will make many viewers skin crawl, he had that effect on me. There's a contempt in his voice when Anna questions her mortality, and he is skilled at preying upon her vulnerable state, able to somehow avoid times when she could actually kill him(she does, at points in the film, get her hands on scissors and a butcher knife). I think that's the lasting power of AFTER.LIFE, that we feel strongly that she should do whatever she can to escape, but each and every attempt fails mostly because Anna herself perhaps buys a lie due to the success of Eliot's methods of persuasion.Kudos to Ricci for such a difficult part, she had to remain in various states of undress for quite a bit of screen time, but, to me, she seemed quite comfortable with her body(which only benefits her many admirers). The subject matter is quite provocative and disturbing, so I imagine some viewers will find AFTER.LIFE a bit tough to take.",After.Life
7,zardoz-13,Bring Out Your Death,8,3 August 2010,"Acclaimed author of American Gothic horror and whodunit detective fiction Edgar Allan Poe wrestled his entire life with the morbid fear of premature burial. Meaning, you awaken and find yourself trapped in a coffin underground. Eventually, you suffocate to death. If Poe could watch the movie ""After.Like,"" he would probably appreciate it. This creepy, atmospheric chiller from freshman director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo won't scare you enough to make you sleep with the lights on after you watch it. Nevertheless, what we have here is a prime candidate for either a ""Twilight's Zone"" or ""A Night Gallery"" episode. The lack of surprise-laden revelations is usually the sign of a lackluster movie, but this wickedly smart mind-bender luxuriates in its indie-produced, low-budget respectability. The production values are first-rate, and the graveyard looks worth spending an afternoon in with a digital camera. The biggest surprise of sorts that ""After.Life"" springs is the change-of-pace role for Liam Neeson. Neeson doesn't make horror movies so ""After.Like"" is rather refreshing for him. Furthermore, Neeson doesn't often play the villain. Neeson has a field day as sinister funeral home director Eliot Deacon who has attitude to spare. Mind you, Eliot is not your run-of-the-mill mortician. He claims that he helps the dead make a smooth transition into death. Neeson delivers a low-key, restrained performance, but you can see the pressure bubbling underneath his mask of impassivity. Eliot is really just a misunderstood fellow, and he cannot believe the idiocy of the living.An unhappy elementary school teacher, Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci of ""Monster""), dies in a highway traffic accident. During a storm she loses control of his vehicle while juggling her cell phone and collides with an 18-wheeler hauling metal pipes. Earlier, Anna had just broken up with her sincere boyfriend, Paul Coleman (Justin Long of ""Drag Me to Hell""), in a restaurant and stampeded out. The relationship between Anna and Paul had been in a nose-dive for some time. Every time they meet each other, their conversation eventually erupts into a quarrel. Ironically, Paul tries to propose to Anna at the restaurant, but Anna believes that he has brought her a high-priced dinner so he can dump her. Paul explains that he is going to accept a higher-paying job in Chicago with more responsibility. He plans to propose to Anna, but she jumps to the wrong conclusion, makes a scene, and exits the restaurant. Futilely, Paul tries to stop Anna from leaving the restaurant. Suddenly, she winds up in Eliot Deacon's premises, but Anna refuses to believe that she is kaput. Indeed, she has a minor but nasty gash on her forehead that Eliot stitches up for her. For all practical purposes, Anna does seem alive and kicking. After all, she argues, she can sit up, walk around, and talk. No matter how many times Deacon reminds her that she is dead, she believes that she remains alive. Eliot shows her the death certificate with her name and date on it. Their relationship grows gradually more contentious.Meanwhile, Ricci' fiancé to be, Justin Long, agonizes over her death. One of Anna's students, eleven-year old Jack (Chandler Canterbury of ""Knowing"") wanders around on the fringes trying to find out what is going on, too. Jack and Eliot get along and Eliot promises to teach Jack what he knows about the dead. Wojtowicz-Vosloo generates some tantalizing suspense and tension, particularly in the last quarter hour of ""After.Life"" when Eliot holds Anna's funeral and poor Paul can finally say farewell to the love of his life. Later, our heroine has her worst fears confirmed when she finds herself conscious in a casket as the dirt hits the lid while they bury her. Previously, Anna had demanded to see herself in a mirror before Eliot paralyzed her with another injection of hydronium bromide to keep her calm during the ceremony.Red-blooded, heterosexual guys who crave the sight of bare female flesh may find themselves gaping when Ricci displays her cadaverously pale but sublimely alluring nude body without a qualm in all its supple pulchritude. She really looks like a sexy goth gal reclining on the marble-white slab in a homage to Botticelli's Venus. The latest generation of filmmakers all but shun full frontal female nudity, but Wojtowicz-Vosloo integrates it so seamlessly into the narrative that it doesn't seem gratuitous. The ending is just what you would expect from a devilish horror movie. Essentially, there is only one objectionable scene when our heroine is groped by tree roots during a ceremony with ashen-faced old women standing around chanting. ""After.Life"" qualifies as a revisionist horror thriller because evil triumphs in the end over virtue.",After.Life
8,gradyharp,After.Life - there is a clue in the title,7,7 August 2010,"AFTER.LIFE (yes, that is a dot between the two words suggesting this may be a video game...or blog, or something created in cyberspace) takes a long shot; can a one-line story keep an audience's attention for over 103 minutes? Not having noticed whether this played in theaters or is one of the direct to DVD films, that question is tough to answer. The director and writer Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo (writing in tandem with Paul Vosloo and Jakub Korolczuk) asks us to suspend belief and muse about the idea that there is a time between 'death' and the actual burial (or other means of final interment/disposal) when the spirit may struggle with the idea of life ending. It is an interesting hiatus to study and fortunately a cast was selected to portray the characters involved in this internet-like game that makes it watchable. Schoolteacher Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) and Paul Coleman (Justin Long) are in a rocky relationship: they could be headed toward marriage but Anna has trust issues that prevent her from committing to same. In a rage she leaves the frustrated Coleman, subsequently is killed in a car accident, and is taken to a mortuary where mortician Elliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) begins preparing her body for the funeral. Anna is unable to move anything but her mouth and denies that she is dead, a situation Deacon encounters with most every dead body he prepares for burial. And this is where the conundrum begins: is Anna dead or is she alive, kept prisoner by Deacon? Anna's hateful mother (Celia Watson) visits her daughter's corpse and has few kind words to say. Paul is devastated, comforted by his colleague Tom (Josh Charles), that Anna is dead and visits the mortuary to see the body but is refused admittance by Deacon. One of Anna's young students Jack (Chandler Canterbury) seems to have a special affinity for the dead and spies on the mortuary where he sees Anna standing in a window. Anna and Deacon have long talks about the after.life - that time when the soul is preparing to leave the corporal body - and Deacon continues to prepare Anna for her funeral. As she is buried the facts of the story straighten out a bit, but to reveal those facts would ruin what little suspense there is in this film. Though the moody atmosphere is well captured by both the director of photography Anastas N. Michos and the musical score by Paul Haslinger, and the presence of Liam Neeson who plays his role very straight and Christina Ricci who plays her role almost entirely in the nude, give the story the requisite creepy effect. Yes, it is corny in many ways, but at least it is a bit different from the formula movies that keep churning out of Hollywood. Grady Harp",After.Life
9,trashgang,slow but good,6,28 October 2010,"To say that this is a good supernatural horror movie, I would say no. But it really is something special. It is in fact a very slow movie but it didn't bother me because it'a all about, as the title says, afterlife. After a car accident Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) dies and her body is brought to the local funeral director (Liam Neeson). But suddenly she awakes, but the funeral director tells her she's dead. From there on the movie goes into the supernatural and sometimes it doesn't. But what makes the movie good is the performance of Christina, she gives it all here in every part. Liam isn't my kind of an actor surely not after the A-team turkey. I rather would have seen some creepy face instead. But we have to do it with him but he does it like he has to do it. It's the director's first movie and by that I can say she (Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo) did well. The editing was very well and the use of slomo also made it a bit of an arty flick. But for me it's the face of Ricci that made the movie.",After.Life

11,KineticSeoul,"Stuff doesn't make any sense sometimes, but still a good psychological thriller horror flick",7,12 October 2010,"For the most part this is a cleverly crafted film which makes the audience think back and forth cause it can go both ways. Well at least half the film makes you keep thinking of what is really going on, than it leads the audience to decide and throws another reason for the audience to doubt their decision. The plot is this, a stupid girl played by Christina Ricci who is a school teacher gets into a accident. Which leads her body to be in a process of being prepared for her funeral and the person that takes care of her body to look presentable during the funeral is played by Liam Neeson who does a great job with the roles he is given most of the time. While this is going on her boyfriend is trying to seek out her body in order for him to get closure, because he personally thinks she is still alive. Christina Ricci wasn't bad in this role, but I never liked her or found her attractive and found her acting all cocky most of the time to be a bit annoying. But she played her character pretty well in this one although very stupid at times. The main highlight of this film is the constant guessing game, where it leaves it up to the audience for the most part of the movie. Of whether the girl is really dead or if the whole thing is just a sick game. The ending is pretty good and terrifying as well. Sure there are aspect of the film that doesn't make any sense, but it didn't get to the point it got irritating to watch for the most part.***Spoilers below*** The title to this movie is misleading in a way. And I found it odd how there are hardly and emos or goths in this flick considering the ending and all. This could have also been another ""Saw"" movie with less blood and gore, but with the title ""Saw"" it's a dead give away of what is really going on.7.2/10",After.Life
12,sddavis63,Creepy In A Number Of Ways,5,17 December 2010,"On the plus side, ""After.Life"" keeps the viewer guessing right up to the very end - is Anna dead or not? For the most part it seemed pretty clear cut. She was killed in a car crash, declared dead by the coroner and ended up in the prep room of a local funeral home in preparation for her funeral. That sounds pretty definite. Funeral director Eliot Deacon, though, introduced an element of uncertainty. Basically, it seems as if he's a guy who has a gift for being able to communicate with the dead, and so the fact that Anna is awake and talking to him seems sufficiently explained. He's helping her ""spirit"" if you will accept her death. But there are niggling questions that make you wonder if he's somehow drugged her and is holding her prisoner for some sick, twisted reason. And you keep wondering right up to the very end, even to the point of believing that he's buried her alive. It is creepy in that way - and all that works pretty well. Liam Neeson was fine in the role of Deacon, and seemed to capture the character pretty well.There were other parts of this that didn't work as well for me, though. I had trouble with Christina Ricci in this role. I have nothing against her, and her acting was all right. It really was jarring, though, to see her in the nude for significant parts of the movie. When I see Christine Ricci, I just can't help it - I still see Wednesday Addams from ""The Addams Family."" I really can't help it. And in this movie she even looked a bit like Wednesday Addams - at least from the neck up! In other words, I still see her as a little girl, and seeing her nude was honestly uncomfortable for me as a result. Or one could say it was creepy - but not in a good sense this time. I also have to say that Justin Long really didn't strike home with me as Anna's boyfriend Paul, and the character of Jack - one of Anna's students (played by a young actor named Chandler Canterbury) who is supposed to share Deacon's gift of communicating with the dead - was a bit superfluous. He added little to the story and was also kind of creepy in his own way.There's enough to this movie to make it worth watching, but it certainly isn't a classic by any means.",After.Life

What's even more stranger is that Deacon is not at all surprised that what's supposed to be a dead body doesn't show any signs of being dead at all! It's then that things really start to get weird with Deacon claiming to have this power to communicate with the dead that he developed over the years in dealing, as an mortician and undertaker, with them! What seems to really tick off the sweet kindly and understanding Deacon is people like Anna who refuse to accept that their dead and make his job,in convincing them that they are, harder then it already is!You've got to suspend reality in following the storyline in ""After.Life"" in that it's main character Elliot Deacon doesn't come across as the deranged psycho as he seems to be. Well liked and respected by everyone in the community Deacon's crazy actions, especially with the what seemed like the alive but not quite dead Anna Taylor, don't quite fit his kind and sensitive feeling for all humanity personality! It's in fact Anna's boyfriend Paul who senses that Deacon is hiding something from him in refusing to let him view Anna's body. Claiming that Anna's body is available for viewing only for family members until the actual funeral takes place!

Is Anna dead or not? Is Deacon some crazed psycho who's been providing his mortuary with live customers not only for financial but, in experimenting with them, personal gain? It does seem that Deacon can somehow communicate with the dead but how he developed this supernatural power,besides being a mortician & undertaker, is never fully explained.

14,bowmanblue,A 'Marmite movie' - you'll either love it or hate it,7,3 November 2014,"After.Life (in case the title didn't give you a clue) is about what happens after death. In this case, Christina Ricci's death. She wakes up in an undertaker's (Liam Neeson) workshop and he informs her she's dead. Of course she naturally points out that she can think, talk and run off, which kind of disproves his theory. So... is he trying to mess with her mind, or can he really talk to the dead? The film is quite static and sticks mainly to the undertaker's home. This lack of movement may have aided its low budget, but can make it feel like the film isn't going anywhere. Plus it is quite long and, in my opinion, that's its major downfall. It's a great premise and all three major players (Ricci, Neeson and Justin Long) play their parts well. It just could be a little tighter here and there.It's hard to say what kind of film After.Life is. It's one part horror, one part supernatural mystery, one part drama and one part thriller. I can see why people don't like it. It can be construed as a little 'all over the place.' I would never say it's perfect, but, if you're in the mood for something that isn't wall to wall action (perhaps Liam Neeson needed something a little 'slower' after Taken 1 and 2!) and more of a slow burner, then you might like After.Life.

15,secondtake,"Ricci's body, Neeson's calm, Long's shallowness...and a clumsy script",4,9 October 2010,"After.Life (2009)A Christina Ricci love fest. If you want to watch or ogle at Ricci's young body, partially or fully nude, laying down or running helplessly around in either a minimal red slip or nothing at all, this is your movie.If you want to appreciate Liam Neeson's manly reserve, or Justin Long's nice guy schtick, you'll get a little of each. And if you want a plot idea that has, in paragraph form, some potential, you get that, too, but this will only lead to frustration and possibly disgust at all the time your wasting as you hope this idea goes somewhere.It does not.Because it's not enough to slap your subject and walk away, I'll forge on. Any movie, even a quasi-horror supernatural flick without pretensions, needs to have believable characters, and you would think this veteran cast could pull rabbits out of hats. But the basic writing--not the overarching plot, but the dialog, scene by scene--is unconvincing, unlikely, or just repetitive. In a word, it's bad. You see Neeson in particular honestly trying to make it work. Long, who is great as the Mac guy and very convincing in his Jeepers Creepers role, can't quite make his small part flesh out. He reacts, and overacts at times. But he has little to say or do in general, so I don't blame him.It's back to Ricci, in the end. Some people I'm sure will be glad to have a movie where half of the screen time is Ricci naked glory. But in fact, none of it is necessary or interesting or even so sexy, if that's your thing. It's not mine, I hope that's clear, and yet there's no avoiding her. And no avoiding how much the movie is about that simple voyeurism, about Ricci being available for the viewer to look at. I dwell because in the end, that IS what this movie is about. The fact that a middle aged (and good looking, heck) man is the one undressing her and gawking at her is only aggravating.What was Ricci thinking? This won't ruin her career because, a) lots of people want what this movie offers (let's watch DVD sales), and b) not many people are going to see this thing. But what was she thinking? It must have been clear what her role really was. And so, what, she thinks so highly of herself? And what was the director thinking, a woman herself? Well, it's Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo's first film. Even ignoring the voyeuristic aspects, there is a plot idea that is squandered, and a film logic that is bungled, so that in the ends it's a movie wannabe at best. Did I saw without pretensions earlier? What is that dot doing in the title? Ha.",After.Life

This ridiculous film is kind of fun to watch as long as one doesn't try to make any sense out of the logic that the film is built upon. Ricci is an alluring presence as a woman who is trapped between life and death at a funeral home, as she wanders about, often naked, wondering if she's really dead or she's being held prisoner.

17,filipemanuelneto,"Good tension, good atmosphere, good Liam Neeson, but that's all.",3,15 October 2017,"This movie is a bit difficult to describe, in that we never completely realize everything. The plot consists of this: after a serious car accident, a young teacher wakes up in a morgue and is informed that she has died. The rest of the film is based on doubts as to whether she's really dead, in her conflicted relationship with her mother, and in her ill-fated romance with her boyfriend. Another thing that hangs in the air but never reveals itself is the real nature of the owner of the mortuary, who may be a man with a gift to speak to the dead or a cold killer. In short, there is a lot here but nothing actually reveals itself, leaving the film in total doubt about most of what we have seen. It's a lukewarm movie, without power or impact. The atmosphere and tension are pleasant, but they never materialize into something. Christina Ricci moans too much and has a voice too soft which makes her a bit annoying. Honestly, she seems horny all the time, and the fact that she appears almost naked in most of the film does not help to undo that impression. Liam Neeson is the best actor here, with a deep, psychologically rich, pleasing and sinister interpretation. Justin Long is fine, but he's too paranoid and superficial.",After.Life
18,billcr12,Neeson is perfect,8,18 May 2012,"Liam Neeson is Eliot, an undertaker who claims to speak with the newly deceased as they transition from life to death. Christina Ricci is Anna, a school teacher, who after dinner with her boyfriend, gets into a car accident. When she ""awakens"" on a table at a morgue, Eliot is explaining to her that she is dead and he is her guide for the journey into the next world.The funeral director injects a drug into Anna so that rigor mortis doesn't start. She eventually escapes, but due to Eliot's persuasiveness, believes that she is really dead. Her boyfriend becomes suspicious and confronts Eliot, who explains to him that there are many corpses walking around with no life left inside them. Neeson is hilarious, the perfect choice for this role and Ricci is also very good. The last fifteen minutes or so reminded me of the Twilight Zone of the 1960s or Alfred Hitchcock from the same era. The finale is not a sellout and After Life is worth the ride just to watch Liam Neeson work.",After.Life
19,smatysia,Kind of different,7,5 June 2011,"I have to give this a bit of credit for originality, not being another of an endless list of sequels and comic book remakes. Interesting as well, how it leaves the main question of the film ambiguous, at least for a while. Liam Neeson was believable, yet sufficiently creepy in his role. Justin Long, who I recall from TV, is coming into his own. I might have done a few things different with the script, but at least the direction was competent and unobtrusive. Christina Ricci showed some real range in an extremely peculiar role. From the title, apparently some folks are expecting philosophy or eschatology, but only get a psychological film, not quite a ""thriller"", but I liked it.",After.Life

Christina Ricci gives on heck of a performance as our ""dead"" girl,, at points in the movie you the viewer even start to wonder, as if like hey maybe she ain't quite dead yet,, the evil Funeral Director wastes no time in preparing her for her final moments before burial, the boyfriend has to figure out what is going on and if she is still alive before she is due to be buried,, interesting movie.. and an original concept for once.",After.Life

Anna wakes up in the basement of the local funeral home, and the funeral director tells her that she is dead (with a certificate to prove it). He also tells her that he can talk to the dead. Anna wants out, but he will not let her leave, claiming that she must accept the truth. Is she really dead or is he nuts?After Life has a great set-up, but from there, things get worse. What keeps the viewer hooked is the promise of an an upcoming climactic twist, like that in the Sixth Sense (the film which After Life has its roots in). Unfortunately, with each passing chapter, it becomes more evident that the outcome we would like is not going to come. Yet what is more bothersome about After Life is that frankly it is dull. I see an idea here, but I don't see a movie. After Life recalls Awake in that it functions well as an experiment in psychologically related themes, but it doesn't provide exiting or suspenseful material. After Life has really nowhere to go, but down. Despite being partial fantasy, its inability to make sense is aggravating and not acceptable.

22,raulfaust,Lost in the echo,5,24 July 2014,"""After.Life"" is a movie that begins with a bad acting from the main actors, which made me think it would be a total mess. Afterwards, it turned out to be just a regular picture. The main controversy in this awkward story involves life and death; filmmakers built situations that made spectator curious whether the girl was really dead or not. That would've been a great idea, if it hasn't been used in lots of other movies before 2009. Also, from the get go we're used with the idea that Anna is dead, and the outcome isn't any different from that, so there is no surprise for the spectator-- which is important in movies that deal with hereafter and mystery. The plot is very slow-paced, and I believe the biggest part of the audience won't be patient enough to reach it's ending. Also, considering this film has been labeled as an horror back when released, I believe the audience must have felt cheated, since there is no gore, tension or anything that may frighten the spectator. For fans of the subject, I suggest you pictures that are way better, like 2000's ""Waking the Dead"" or 2008's ""Passengers"", and I'm not mentioning ""The Others"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" because everybody out there has seen them at least one time in their lives.",After.Life
23,lewiskendell,Ricci anchors an underrated gem.,8,4 August 2010,"""It's time you finally accepted the truth. You are dead. You will never live again.""In After.Life (cool title, right?) Christina Ricci plays Anna, a young school teacher who's drifting through life with a bottle of pills, unable to even connect to her boyfriend (Justin Long, who seems to play the main character's boyfriend in nearly every movie he's in) in the bedroom or in a simple conversation. After her apparent death in an accident, she somehow wake up in a funeral home with a mortician (Liam Neeson, with his creepy dial turned up to over 9000) that she had a chance encounter with earlier that day. He claims that he has a gift for communicating with the recently deceased, and it's his job to help her accept the reality of her death and move on. But, is he really telling the truth? Is Anna actually dead, or has she become the captive of a truly disturbed man? As she struggles to answer this question inside the funeral home, her boyfriend and a young student of hers are left wrestling with questions of their own.I'm mystified by some of the negative reviews I've seen for this movie. Perhaps people were expecting a horror film? That's not at all what After.Life aspires to be. It's a thriller with supernatural elements. And the criticisms of ambiguity are even more baffling. If you're capable of paying a moderate amount of attention while watching, the events of the movie  and the ending are quite clear. While the film did have a few editing errors (early evening to pitch black night, in the time it takes to find a key on a keyring?), the dialgoue was occasionally clunky, and some people may be put off by some of the questionable decisions that Anna makes, I thought this was a solid movie. The premise was interesting, and I always find Christina Ricci to be a fine actress, when given decent material. There were points in the movie where I was actually riveted. I'll admit that After.Life requires you to keep your suspension of disbelief handy, but I thought it was well worth the effort. I passionately recommend that anyone who's interested gives After.Life a try. Just please be warned, I repeat, this is NOT a horror movie. Some people may feel that it's slow-paced, but I never found it to be even slightly dull. The pace suited the story perfectly. Most importantly, you have to pay attention if you want to avoid the confusion that so many people seem to have inexplicably suffered from.",After.Life
24,oneguyrambling,If you shelve all logic and ignore the ridiculousness - it still isn't very good.,5,27 December 2010,"The odd thing about after.life is that there are a lot of things in the film that either don't go anywhere or simply aren't required, and an equal number of things that are totally illogical and out of place. Paul (Justin Long) and Anna (Christina Ricci) are a couple in limbo, it appears that Anna is not totally sold on the concept of them remaining together, much to Paul's distress. Anna is a teacher and one afternoon she attends the funeral of her piano teacher, for some reason she decides just beforehand to have her brown hair dyed bright red - just the thing to do before funerals apparently. After the funeral she meets Paul at a restaurant for a fancy dinner, Paul proudly informs her of his new promotion and explains that it involves a move to another city, he is obviously half way through telling Anna that he wants her to go with him when she ridiculously jumps to ludicrous conclusions that Paul is dumping her, over-reacts and refuses to listen to him and then storms out swearing. Look Paul, I find Christina Ricci and her massive forehead on a lolllypop stick body beguilingly and inexplicably hot, but the bitch is obviously psycho in this film, let her go mate. Only he doesn't get the chance to kick her narrow ass to the kerb, as she drives off in the rain, sobbing and texting, she is in a massive car accident and is killed. We can tell it was a massive car accident because she has a 4 cm cut on her gigantic forehead which is patched up in seconds. (Ridiculous but more palatable once she takes her gear off.) Now Liam Neeson is Eliot Deacon, the local undertaker, as he preps Anna's corpse it is evident that she displays little of the ""rigor"" normally associated with the ""mortis"", Anna can talk, in fact she hardly shuts up. She tells Deacon, frequently, that ""I am not dead"". Far from ignoring her Deacon talks back, as we see later on he talks to all the corpses in his morgue (must be fun at parties), in this regard Deacon is sort of like a Dr Doolittle for the dead Deacon is a perfectionist with his subjects, ensuring that they are as presentable as possible at their final public showing by prepping them in painstaking detail. This is a good thing, as I like my hot nude corpses pristine and pasty. Initially Anna can't move even though she has speech and is aware of her surroundings, later though up she gets and walks around the place, only Deacon runs a tight ship and she and the other more stereotypical corpses are locked into the morgue. Meanwhile back in town, two things happen, Paul discovers that Anna is dead and learns that her Mum refused to tell him as she (again inexplicably) blames him for her death, Anna's Mum appears in only a few scenes, but it is evident that she is a total bitch. Paul is not happy, especially when Deacon refuses to let him see Anna's corpse as he is not ""family"", the cops also ignore his demands for intervention on the grounds that he is obviously stricken with grief and isn't thinking straight. The second development is that a former student of Anna's, 11 year old Jack, starts lurking around the funeral home, chatting to Deacon and generally acting like a creepy kid. He tells Paul that not only is Anna in the place, but he saw her walking around So on and so forth, for the remainder of the film Anna walks around, tries to escape at times and starts to wonder if she is actually dead or not, Paul on the other hand is confident that she ain't for some reason, even though he has scant proof but the words of a small boy. Jack is used to pad some time I think and give Deacon someone to talk to and confide in, and Deacon himself simply stays stoic and dispassionate. There are a couple of what you might call minor twists near the end, some nudity but as always for ""art's sake"", (means not sexy, unless corpses are your bag!), and everyone in the film seriously looks like they are on the fence about the credibility of the picture. It's as if they aren't sure that the film is any good so they seem to only try intermittently. And I agree, after.life is the ultimate ""So what?"" film, there are a lot of ingredients that should add up to something OK, only the whole thing is so, well, bland. I mean if you read this on the DVD cover: * Death* Nudity* Gore* Sex... you might be forgiven for thinking that the film might be OK. In this case OK would be very generous, after.life (stupid title too) has all the elements for an OK film after.all, but when you see the finished product perhaps you too will be saying ""So What?"". Final Rating – 5 / 10. Too many pointless subplots and ridiculous plot elements to take the film seriously, even if you ignore those many flaws the rest isn't much good either. (And as for Christina whipping out the little Ricci's It's appreciated but I'd rather you did it when you were alive.)",After.Life

After.Life, with a period in the middle, is a very good movie with a lot of positive spooky elements and some missing scary essentials. I love the dot in the middle of After.Life. I just have no idea what it means. No more time left for you. You are transitioning to the after life. Christina shows a little boob in the beginning but it wasn't enough. It left me confused wondering what I was getting into instead of anticipating the character's next move. She should have shown more like her boobs getting out of bed or while in the shower or something. This Christina Ricci is something special and her getting naked so much in After.Life is a great reason to watch. She really gives a proper, great performance. The acting in After.Life is stoic and transcends the show to a higher standard. The direction for first time director, Agniezka Wojtowicz-Vosloo, easy name to remember I won't forget that later, is quite really impressive. The creepy slow moving camera and intimate close up personal shots add a real creepiness and intimacy to the story and character performances. Agniezka Wojtowicz-Vosloo displays an understanding of the art. The well.placed visuals with the appeasing red.white color themes help provide a lifeless vibe. Liam Niessen nearly steals the soul of the viewing with comfort and complexity. Niessen dedicated his soul to this character with all his mastery and know.how. Justin Long will stop at nothing to save Anna's life as he desperately unravels the truth. Justin Long will act at all costs as he desperately unravels to the end. I like Justin Long. He's a good actor. He's a bad boyfriend. Christina Ricci is the best. She is so sweet. I love her. Christina plays Anna believably with tenderness and beauty. I know. She's so hot. Christina has the best body ever. I love Christina Ricci.body. After.Life is overly confident and a good.mind.twister. I loooove Christina Ricci.body! She's so pretty.

27,johnstonjames,That Was Way Too Scary. This Will Give You Nightmares For Life.(no pun intended),8,10 August 2010,"whoa. are movies getting scarier, or is it just my imagination? i had a hard time with this. it was too scary and i felt like turning it off because i could'nt handle it. when i was younger i used to scare very easily and would sleep with the light on. a counselor i saw suggested i read some scary books and watch a scary movie all the way through to help me get over my fears. it did'nt work. i still scare easily and still turn the light on at night, only now i have a taste for horror movies and Stephen King books. so much for that.this was a really scary movie about death. movies like 'Lovely Bones' or 'What Dreams May Come' offer the notion of solace after death, a quiet, contented, coming to terms with our own mortality. this movie offers no such comfort. here death is fatal and terrifying and a unhappy thing to be feared. as i got older i thought i had come to terms with the idea of dying and was somewhat okay with it. not anymore. after watching this movie i'm once more terrified of dying. i don't think i'll ever be the same. whatever conclusion you come to about the movie's plot, you'll still think death is something to start screaming about.this movie may not have been as ambitious as the 'Lovely Bones' by Peter Jackson, but it was almost as well done and probably more effective as sheer horror. if you truly think about this movie you won't feel well.a lot of know-it-alls like to go on about how nothing scares them in the movies. if that's true, take the real acid test. wait until dark, turn off all the lights in your home or apartment, watch it alone and not with somebody (horror is always scarier alone in the dark),and then see if it does'nt unnerve you. most people are'nt brave enough to do it. they watch their horror movies with someone or with the lights on. don't be chicken. give yourself the real acid test and see how brave you feel.as far as 'After Life' is concerned, if the horror movies keep getting scarier than some of this stuff, i think i'll call it quits.",After.Life
28,RevRonster,There is life after After.Life,2,23 January 2015,"I think the only real reason I watched this film was because Liam Neeson was in it. And he proved to be the only thing worth my time in this film.The story probably could have been decent or great if more time was taken with the script and the plot was a little further feathered out. This lack of attention and development is also seen in the characters as they are all really poorly developed. Entire character aspects and conflicts will be teased but never touched upon again and the only character that sees any semblance of growth is the character that is dying. Finally, much of the acting is lazy, horrible, or accidental comedy (Justin Long isn't good at serious roles).The only decent part of the film, and I mentioned this already, is Liam Neeson. However, his performance is so good that he makes the worse parts of the cast look that much more terrible because they can't come close to his delivery. Despite his tremendous performance, it isn't grand enough to warrant the time to watch this film.",After.Life
29,danielmanson,A whole load of average,5,3 January 2021,"Yeah I'll be honest, this wasn't the greatest of films I've seen. However nor is it the worst.My main gripe with this film is that it's just a bit dull. For a Horror/thriller not a whole lot actually happens. You know early doors what the outcome is going to be. Whether she is alive or not? So the vast majority of the film is just mere hints to whether she is or not. Which for a film entertaining stand point, made it dull.
Plot wise, it's actually quite a good plot and it's something I've not seen before. I just feel however, they could have gone about it differently. I just didn't really feel any emotion towards it.
The ending is a bit underwhelming as well, don't get me wrong it's not a bad ending or anything massively wrong with it. But it kind of just ends and you're left wanting just a bit more.
I feel like the plot contains a lot of flaws. There's several instances where she could have simply escaped, or attacked him. But no.
The characters as well aren't likeable either in all honesty. I wasn't particularly rooting for anyone as they all annoyed me one way or another.
Finally the horror element of this film is completely non existent, so if you're watching because it's labelled horror (I know it does on Prime) then don't bother, because it's a thriller and nothing more.But yeah, as explained it's an intriguing plot which unfortunately doesn't fish you in. It's not a horrendous film at all, but it's definitely forgetful. 5/10 from me. Bang average, but could have been a lot better if done differently.",After.Life

31,scottshak_111,Very thoughtful but without a happy ending,6,3 September 2010,After Life is a story of a psychopath which is craftily played by Liam Neeson who happens to be a funeral director intent on killing the undead. Christina Ricci plays the damsel in distress character who is truly loved by her boyfriend Justin Long. There is a rift between the two and she ends up dead ( as Liam tells her ) in a car accident. She is fooled into believing that she is dead which as a matter fact wasn't true and that Liam had drugged her at the time of the accident forcing the doctors to report her dead. Justin Long however had this weird connection with her and so he didn't give up on her. He keeps on pestering the police as he was a lawyer to get a search warrant as he smelled something fishy in the funeral house. Meanwhile the desire of Christina to escape the building is suppressed by Liam the psychopath who justifies in his own ways and reassures her that she is indeed dead. A fellow student of hers named Jack however ends up staring her at the window alive and breathing but Liam Neeson however takes care of that quite easily by brain washing the poor lad ( I must say Jack's gonna walk on the psychopath's path for sure if there are any sequels to come ). It is quite too late when she realizes that she wasn't dead and provoking Justin Long eventually does nobody any good. So that's it. The movie ends sadistically but with a brilliance that doesn't go unnoticed. I don't fathom one thing - The fact why Justin Long ends up doing 'exactly nothing' in such type of thrillers. He poses as the hero but loses each time he tries to help. See what he did in Jeepers Creepers and Drag me to hell. Nothing. I mean why does he even get a role when he is supposed to make matters worse in the end ? I must say Liam Neeson did a great job once again. The serene and calm funeral man really stole the show as he never even used violence to get his work done which on the contrary in movies where psychos are entailed people generally go for the kill. The movie reminded me of the finest psychopath created ever - Hannibal Lecter however the movie stands way behind compared to the classic. The story was however out of the box and so I kind of liked it. The climax was good and it really carried it through however I expected a happy ending eventually which never came and I was a bit disappointed I must confess. However it was good with its pace and the thrill was well hidden. It was a total entertainment I must say.,After.Life
32,doug_park2001,"""You all say you're scared of death, but the truth is you're scared of life""",6,18 July 2013,"The cover and premise promise something really original and different, but AFTER LIFE doesn't entirely deliver on that promise. Still, it should more or less appeal to fans of horror and/or Christina Ricci. It's suspenseful but often draggy, with a few fairly decent surprises. As you've probably guessed, this film is really grim and humorless with a number of vagaries. AFTER LIFE begins to touch on several concepts which are never completely fleshed-out (no pun intended) and don't always fit in with the rest of its plot, which is dissatisfying. There are also some interesting spiritual nuances and overtones--references to Jesus's ability to raise the dead, etc--which, again, could have really enhanced this with more development. Though it's basically interesting, AFTER LIFE is one of those films where the makers were obviously unsure of how to develop the story and where to take it. Much is left entirely up to the individual viewer's interpretation. It would be hard to reveal what-all is supposedly going on here without being ruinous, but it seems they could have tried a little harder.",After.Life

36,mrcibubur,Intelligent suspense thriller with ever reliable Mr Neeson,7,4 August 2010,"this is a very interesting film indeed in the mould of Neesons recent 'Chloe' and 'Other Man' and is thought provoking just like Jacksons 'Unthinkable'. The funeral director played by Neeson holds so much power and control over the 'dead', the question we all keep asking after watching this movie is - was she really dead or alive? But the title of the film is 'Afterlife', so we should read into that I think.Gonna watch the movie a couple more times, puzzled by the beginning and the funeral for the old man - why should Anna attend that funeral and why was she seemingly already familiar with the funeral director? Jack the boy in Anna Taylors class is also an interesting character and there are lots of questions about him in this movie.Yes, there are lots of inconsistencies in a medical sense as to how the funeral director could keep the woman (and others) alive and for what benefit but it didn't seem to matter overall because the suspense balanced on a boyfriend who was paranoiac in not accepting his girlfriends death and a girlfriend who didn't want to live but had everything to live for (oddly, a theme of Coelhos 'Veronica Decides to Die).There is some female nudity of Anna Taylor while she is 'detained' but nothing sexual and throughout only a few occasional swear words in passing, nothing that should offend a conservative audience.Definitely a film to watch more than once because the director has injected lots of little intricate details which are easy to miss (like the 'chicken burial bit') but never mind, in a month when films in circulation are poor, this is up there as one of the best around at the moment. Mr Neeson never seems to let us down.",After.Life
37,RichardSRussell-1,100 Minutes Sipping from a Demitasse of Tepid Tears,5,7 August 2010,"After.Life (1:44, R) — fantasy: supernatural; 3rd string; originalSince no new SF&F movies were released this week, I'm reviewing a film just out on DVD that never made it to the theaters here in Madison, Wisconsin, when it debuted back in April. At the time, I wondered why not, since it starred Christina Ricci, Liam Neeson, and Justin Long, not exactly the biggest of names but certainly serious actors who don't normally take schlock work just for a paycheck.Having now seen the movie, I can understand the difficulty. It's really hard to figure out how to market something as unusual as this (especially since the distributor apparently didn't even try), and I don't wonder that it had a hard time finding its audience. It ran for only 4 weeks in barely 3 dozen theaters and has a lifetime gross that just squeaks into 6 digits.The premise is that Ricci's Anna Taylor, a schoolteacher, has died in a car crash but apparently wakes up on the mortician's prep table. She can speak and breathe but can't feel her pulse or anything else. Also, she can't move at first, altho eventually she's able to get off the table and walk around. Undertaker Eliot Deacon (Neeson) assures her that she is indeed dead, but that ""you people"" just can't seem to accept it, implying that this is nothing unusual in his extensive experience. ""But I'm not dead"", Anna protests. ""You're still in denial"", he rebukes her.Meanwhile, Anna's boyfriend Paul Coleman (Long), whose proposal attempt the previous evening went badly awry, causing Anna to flee in tears, is also having trouble accepting that she's dead, especially after he gets what he thinks (and we see) is a phone call from her, tho in a ghastly inaudible whisper.The only other character of any significance is a young boy from Anna's class, Jack (Chandler Canterbury), who's fascinated with death and keeps dropping by the mortuary to chat about it. In a distant echo of The 6th Sense, he comes close to being able to see dead people himself, and Deacon sees in him an incipient kindred spirit.The movie keeps us guessing all the way thru as to whether Anna is truly dead or whether Eliot has just drugged her and is playing some kind of really sick game.This interesting premise is one of the upsides. Another is the art design, with recurrent images of brilliant red against deathly pale white (wine on shirt, lipstick on corpse, hair dye in sink, blood in tub, and the red slip that Ricci wears for the 1st half of the movie), in what I'm guessing is probably not an homage to the collected works of Stephenie Meyer. Still another plus is that Ricci spends the 2nd half of the film without even that red slip on. (Yes, I know she's supposed to be a corpse, and there's not even a hint of sexuality about it, but I am a certified guy, and she is Christina Ricci, and there are limits to my ability to suspend my disbelief.)The downside is that there's no life in the film. This was undoubtedly calculated to produce exactly that reaction, and I'm not sure how else they could have played it that would have worked any better, but the end result is like an hour and a half spent sipping from a demitasse of tepid tears. Every now and again someone throws some crockery against a wall, but their hearts don't seem to really be in it, and that's about as exciting as it gets. Eliot's placid, reassuring, accepting demeanor and calm, soothing voice have a soporific effect not only on Anna but also on us.So this leaves me in the odd position of rating this unique experience at 5 (average) in terms of quality, despite being about as far from average as you can imagine in terms of content. I find my own reaction about as unsatisfying as the movie itself.I conclude with this thot. I believe the picture itself died a slow, lingering death. But within it, Anna asks ""Why do we die?"" and Eliot answers ""To make life important."".

38,stevepat99,Woke-up and realized this film was a bad dream!,3,13 April 2010,"At times weird, at times bizarre, at times colorful, at times creepy but at ALL times treated myself & companion as brainless twits who were thereby expected to buy into its nonsensical script. One reviewer nailed it: Is she alive or dead? Then, as the film progressed, the answer was yes then no then yes then maybe et seq. until finally the fellow reviewer correctly concludes the answer is 'surprisingly evasive.' I will say surprisingly nonsensical.Another reviewer correctly hones in on the fact that the film's sub-plots of boyfriend and little boy 'lead no where.' At this point cinematic frustration was gathering speed.After.life does not hold a smidgen of a candle to the similar genre likes of The Sixth Sense with its ultra intelligent, audience grabbing script. Rather, here the director and screenplay take the audience for lack luster Alice-in-Wonderland after-life ride where clues are not clues, what you see is not what you see and what you get is not what you paid for unless, that is, you paid to see the awesome looking Christina Ricci baring it all in many or possibly most of her scenes.Finally, when the film should be heading toward 'resolution' a police officer arrives at Liam Neeson's funeral home to 'visit' with his deceased brother. The officer sees 'something' and utters the searing words 'something is wrong.'You could hear a pin drop. Seconds later I felt in my heart of cinema hearts it was indeed the film itself that was very, very wrong.",After.Life

The plot has a surprising amount of subtlety. Christina Ricci is in a car accident and wakes up in a morgue. The viewer is left guessing: is she a ghost, or is the funeral director a sadist who drugged her to bury her alive? The story is unsettling and the dilemma isn't thrown to your face in an obvious way, it's always present but a little out of focus. Liam Neeson's coldness really works here.The visuals are nothing special and the film is low-budget. I was surprised with the amount of nudity, but it makes sense, as the film mostly takes place at the morgue.",After.Life

The wankoid title IS the warning sign you thought it was.The enjoyable parts of it are: * Christina Ricci in the nude for most of the film - this may or may not excite you.* Liam Neeson being Mr Blank and doing it quite menacingly - ditto.The problem with this film is that it shoots its main device in the head.If you have a mystery where there are two possible explanations, and you are guessing all the way along which one it is, then you only have three options: Door 1: RESOLVE it - show which one of the explanations applied.Wankoid.Fest is very afraid of this door.Door 2: DON'T RESOLVE it - leave it ambiguous, but leave both explanations possible. To do this you have to have a very good script and a very watchable moment-by-moment screenplay.Drivel.Tournament does not have either of these, and crashes into the wall as it gets REALLY confused and toys with choosing some random combination of Door 2 and Door 3 - Door 3: Make it IMPOSSIBLE for either explanation to be correct, instead we now have an UNRELIABLE NARRATOR, and the audience has to dig out what is happening for themselves. Again, this has the requirements that Door 2 does, as well as needing said narrator.Masturbatory.Indulgence does not have a narrator at all, instead it just has a 'bunch of people doing stuff', and thus in any brush with Door 3 it has no choice but to crash and burn.

41,OneAnjel,"Hint: it's a mystery, not a supernatural film",8,31 January 2021,"I found this film intriguing enough, Ricci and Neeson are seasoned actors and do a great job with what they have. I've read a number of the reviews and they say the film is about either the after-life, or somewhere trapped between death and life, or some guy who speaks to the dead... It's none of these. I mean, it's listed as Horror, Suspense, & Mystery but never Supernatural. That's your first clue. What it is, perhaps more than anything else, is the writer's attempt to point out the living-dead who walk among us ""sh-tting and eating"", as Deacon says several times. Do corpses sh-t and eat? No. But the ""dead people"" he talks to do. They also heal (Anna's scar was completely gone by the time of her funeral); they throw things; see their breath on mirrors; and steal keys, which Deacon wouldn't have been concerned about if she were a corpse on a table. Deacon later tells his 11 y/o understudy Jack that he must bury all the people who are walking around polluting the atmosphere with their disrespect of life. The film is asking over and over if we are all living to the fullest and what we would do if we got a second chance. I admit, there is a lot of confusing misdirection designed to confuse the viewer (like when Jack tells Paul ""no, I didn't say she was alive, I said I saw her standing there."" True, that's not exactly what he said, but here the film is hoping we'll wonder if we're witnessing another 6th Sense scenario to throw us off yet again. But we already know the boy believes Anna is in need of rescuing. And when Jack buries the motherless chick alive, the film is telling us what Jack has learned from Deacon. In the end, when the boyfriend supposedly crashes, why else would Deacon be on the side of the road? He's not a coroner or an ME. And how could he have known Paul's time was near? Only if he drugged him and planned it out. Also, when the boyfriend is on the table he totally feels what's happening, unlike the teacher who was given muscle paralyzing injections when needed to fool visitors instead of being killed quickly with a stabilizing rod (which has no business being put sideways through someone's chest). He's just a funeral director and a mortician (who have comparable degrees to medical doctors on many levels for knowledge of the human body and what drugs affect it in what ways). If you try to fill the holes in the plot and make sense of everything, you'll be up all night. This movie is a puzzle; a mystery with many clues and a bonus prize (if you take the message when you leave your seat). If you don't like mysteries, you probably won't like this film.",After.Life

I was expecting a ridiculous twist to be introduced in the finale.

Essentially much screen time is spent watching the protagonist react to her situation and perhaps figure out whether she's alive.Elsewhere, other characters soon discover the protagonist may still be alive, or perhaps they themselves possess powers similar to the ones the funeral director claims he has albeit without knowing it.I'm happy enough the story stayed ambiguous.",After.Life

45,trnjamesbond,This film was excellent,7,20 September 2010,"Well let's see where do I start. The cast and crew were totally amazing in this film they worked so well together. Christina Ricci was amazing. So Lifelike, no pun intended. Liam Neeson, was spectacular. I love the colors of this film, it felt so right. It had great camera direction. I really enjoyed the friendship between Neeson's character and the little boy. You almost want to believe that Ricci's character is still alive, but because of the ending you never do find out. All in all this film had all the qualities that a great film should have. Suspense, frightening scenes, and altogether a simple story. I would recommend it to other people to watch this film. The writer's and camera crew, the director obviously worked hard on this and they deserve to be noticed. It takes a lot to make a good suspense film these days. Everything has been done already there is nothing out there that people haven't seen before. But this film had a very depressing undertone to it. But it worked so well in the script. The funeral home idea is something that people don't like to think about. What happens when our body is lying on the slab and the mortician has to embalm us. It kind of reminded me of the cult classic Phantasm. Which is totally not like this film except for the idea of the funeral home. But this movie added more compassion and drama. I will put this in my collection so I can watch it years to come. Well hats off to all the hard work the film crew did to make this movie work. It's much appreciated to watch an original film these days instead of some cheaply thrown together Hollywood remake. Thank you very much for this film.",After.Life

I hoped it would be something like The Butterfly Effect or Jacobs Ladder. Looking back i feel a little silly expecting this knowing Neeson and Ricci were running the show. It is just awful.They had a good plot but didn't know how to make a story around it. Way to fast the movie works up to the death of Ricci. After some hilarious twists she end up in a morgue where she keeps walking around in disbelief slashing knifes at the funeral home owner. Ricci is so irritating that you wish she played a corpse for the rest of the film. Neeson plays every part in every movie the same way: as himself. The plot, the characters, all of it gives the impression that it is made on a rainy afternoon with nothing to do and some left over budget.",After.Life
48,plutus1947,Strange but extremely watchable,8,24 May 2017,"This is a very strange movie but nevertheless extremely watchable.SPOILER BEGINS This is the tale of a beautiful woman, Anna Taylor (Christina Ricci) who walked out on her boyfriend, Paul Coleman (Justin Long) at a restaurant just before he was going to propose to her.She drives off crying and eventually is involved in a car accident and finds herself on an undertakers slab ready to be prepared for burial by Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson), the Funeral Director.Anna can move and speak and Eliot can see and hear her and of course Anna wants to know why she is where she is and Eliot tells her that the accident left her dead and he was going to prepare her for her funeral and burial. He even shows her a copy of her Death Certificate.He tells her that he has a gift of being able to see and speak to the dead.From then on it was a cat and mouse game between Anna and Eliot, she trying to convince him that she is still alive and Eliot trying to get Anna to accept she was dead.Before she ended up in the Funeral Parlour Anna was a schoolteacher and one of her students Jack (Chandler Canterbury) insisted that he saw her peering out of the window in the Funeral Home.SPOILER ENDS The wonderful thing about this movie is that you simply did not know whether Anna was still alive or indeed dead until the very last minute of the movie and the ending was for most people totally unexpected although I thought I had figured it out about a minute before all was revealed and I am glad to say I was right.However I am not going to reveal the outcome I thoroughly recommend that you watch this movie. The acting was superb but that is what you would expect from three such talented actors and the Direction was superb.The writers, Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo and Paul Vosloo must be congratulated on such a great script.A special mention should be given to Chandler Canterbury who played Jack the student at Anna's school. He is a very talented child actor, played his part wonderfully and given the chance I am sure he will become a well established adult actor.I feel you should be warned that Christina Ricci spent about 25% of the movie naked but in my case that was an enormous plus.I have no hesitation in recommending this movie and have given it an 8 star rating. 6 for the movie and 2 for Christina Ricci allowing us red blooded males the pleasure of seeing her superlative body.",After.Life

Ricci wondered around aimlessly looking and acting drippy - like a corpse!Is she dead, isn't she dead....who cares? Neeson the funeral director prepares bodies for the funeral and is supposed to be conversing with the dead. Ricci destroys his 'treatment' room. Is she dead, isn't she dead? Who cares? If she's dead how did she mess up the room? Who cares. The scar on her forehead is red and sore and stitched, then it's cleared up a little, then it's sore. Is she/isn't she dead? Who cares? Very poor film, not sure why it's described as 'psychological' thriller. She's dead but thinks she isn't. Breath on mirror, he panicked, she saw it, nothing more said or done about it. Who makes this crap? Cheap shock tactics, all been done before. What's the point of the weird kid, what's with his mother, now SHE looked dead.

52,brdlybaum,"This is one of the worst films I have seen for a very, very long time!",1,3 August 2011,"This is so bad I would put it as even worse than the complete pile of horse manure that is Piranha (the latest one with Kelly Brook in)! That alone tells you just how bad the film is! Why would someone who is not dead end up on the mortician's/funeral director's table being prepared for a burial? The person would not even come close to being there if there is still life in them so this whole premise, the whole premise of the film which is 'is a mortician/funeral director burying people alive or are we just seeing him talk to the person's ghost?' would NEVER happen! The Director let's us viewers know often during the film that Anna Taylor (played in an OK way by Ricci) is alive and that she is just being drugged all of the time to make it look like she is dead. So going along those lines that means that when Deacon (played by Liam Neeson) is talking to dead people's spirits he is not actually talking to them at all therefore making him clearly mad, a character trait that could have been fun to explore but clearly was not allowed to do so.Christina's character is supposed to be hysterical and it is at times in both meanings of the word! Someone who is scared and running for their lives would not start zig-zagging along a corridor bouncing off of the walls/lockers on each side as he or she went! That one seen alone captured both meanings of the word hysterical! I got the feeling the Jack played (if you can call it that. I certainly cannot) by Chandler Canterbury was Deacon's son but that wasn't really explained properly. That part could have been cut out completely as it made no difference to the film whatsoever.What was it that Justin Long's character Paul Coleman had done that was so bad in Anna's mother's eyes that made her so angry and so annoyed with him that she did not want him near her or Anna. So much so that she still hadn't told him she had 'died' eight or ten days later? We never found out! Where did the endless stream of bodies come from with all of thee relevant paper work perfectly completed to enable Deacon to bury the bodies alive? Obviously the police chief had something to do with it as even though he is supposedly a (close) friend and even though he is told by another at the station it is possible to drug someone to make it look as though they are dead he refuses to believe Coleman. Some friend! The coroner and the doctor that signed the Death Certificate are obviously in on this sub plot of evil but again that story line goes nowhere. Why are they happily doing all that they can to allow people to be buried alive? I could keep on pointing out massive plot falls and holes but as I think I am nearing the 1,000 words maximum allowance I am having to stop here! I will however just say two more things, the first being that I really do love films that have the viewer asking questions at the end. A lot of David Cronenberg's films do this and in my opinion he must be the greatest unsung director there has been in my lifetime. One of his films that leaves the viewer asking questions is Existenzbit it does that in a great way. This on the other hand does it in a really awful way. This really is a film to avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!! Oh and you only get to see Christina Ricci's breasts a few times, you see her back once and her bottom once! That is all! She is not naked for most of the film as has been claimed numerous times, for most of the film she is in a red under dress that would nowadays be worn as just a normal dress!",After.Life

Christina Ricci is terrible as are every other performance supporting her. The story/script seems to have been written on a napkin in 5 minutes.

55,jadediamond,Okay concept with no payoff,6,21 July 2020,"Sometimes a final twist elevates a mediocre movie like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Most time it undermines a movie. This movie has an interesting twist but it wanted to be so ambiguous like a Christopher Nolan movie that it undermine a movie with the potential to be great.I've been a fan of the horror genre since I was a kid but I'm learning there is no one size fits all horror movie. So what I may find as a good horror film is boring and not good for another fan. I want an interesting concept, good execution, strong acting, tension, atmosphere, well placed jump scenes, a compelling storyline, good writing, to be scared, no nudity, a sympathetic yet smart hero with an equally compelling villain. A good pyschological thriller like 1408/The Shining. A good, entertaining slasher flick like some Halloween/Friday the 13th movies or a compelling horror fantasy thriller like Mama. Yet, other horror fans simply want the traditional tropes of sex, violence, and gore. They want the bloody violence of a Saw or Texas Chainsaw movie. They want the gritty/exploitation films of trailer park trash movies of Rob Zombie/Quentin Tarantino of poor country whites using excessive profanity every scene, naked women every scene, and excessive gore and violence. Like Rob Zombie's version of Halloween. Fans of the original hated Michael being taken out of the surburbs and being placed in a trailer park trash movie with bullies, a peverted, fouled language disabled stepfather, promicious sisters, a stripper for a mother, and having psychological serial tendencies like a real life Jeffrey Damher. Others loved those exploited movies.So this movie annoyed me because it had three strong leads: (Ricci) Anna, the heroine schoolteacher who wakes up in a morgue after a car accident, (Long),her longtime boyfriend Paul, Neeson (the mortician Elliot), and Cantebury (Anna's death obsessed student Jack). I hate how people always bash Justin Long's acting. He's a good actor and can only do so much with the weak material given. The kid actor was good too and there were a lot of symbolism used with this movie.If the motivation for this film is we're not living fulfilling lives then why not have a success happy ending of the heroine wanting to live and not fear love and the hero willing to risk his life to save the woman he loves. Yet, the ending becomes ambiguous and the twist is he gets the same fate she gets of questioning whether he's really alive or not. Yet, it was dumb because it was revealed she was alive. And the hero loved the heroine. He understood her craziness, wanted to marry her, and accept a job opportunity else. So he wanted to live and the ending only cheated him out of life and love. His fate was cruel not horror movies obsession with making every movie a M. Night Shyamalan twist when that twist worked in his overhyped movie The Sixth Sense because it was original at the time.The actors all did great with the concept given. But if Anna Taylor dies, what was her lesson learned? You choose life and love and a crazy mortician still buries you alive. The movie makes the ending ambiguous but it's already established she was alive. So the movie could have been great but besides the crazy Elliot doing his nutty job of convincing alive people they are really dead and making the audience between he can actually talk to dead people and the easily manipulative kid with a fascination with death and invalid mother. The rest of the cast was stupid. When Anna had a chance to escape, she wouldn't speak thinking Paul coming for her was in her head. I have met dumb do nothing cops in real life but no cop could go investigate Paul's story after another cop admitted there are cases of drugs out there which can make a body look dead or the cop who copped a feel didn't think a corpse's moving its head was a big deal.it was an okay film which outsmarted itself out of being a better film",After.Life

It's not clear whether the writer ever had a grip on things and watched it get lost in the film's execution, or whether it remained this muddled at every stage. I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when this idea was pitched. How was Liam Neeson corralled into participating in this unfocused mess?

At times she is really believable and at times, she struggled to hold my attention and interest. She spends most of the Movie, either semi or naked, which draw no complaints from me, but most of the time, it felt slightly unneeded. Unless the character was a stark raving so-and-so, she would have surely used the sheet she was given, to cover herself up. But, alas, obviously the screenwriter/director wanted her that way, and that's what he got. However, I found this terribly distracting, no seriously... She is hot as hell, but at times I had to shake my head and try to play catch up to the dialogue, due to my mind wandering off and imaging what i'd ""do"" to her if I saw her dead...on a slab... in front of me... (That was a joke by the way, before anyone calls 999)..Liam Neeson is as solid as ever in this movie and I've said it before and I'll say it again. There are (Fundamentally) two different class of mainstream actors. Character Actors and Actor Characters... Liam Neeson falls into the latter, like many others such as Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwar(whatever)... Actors who have branded themselves into the bums of Hollywood. When you hire Liam Neeson, that's exactly what you do... You HIRE Liam Neeson and he is a portrayal of your character, not an actor who characterises your portrayal... (If that makes any sense to anyone else)...He is solid in this movie and he definitely carries this forth, if he wasn't in this movie I could see this being a bit of a flop (unless of course you had someone like Phillip S. Hoffman or Hugh Laurie of course)...The other actor (the guy our of Drag me to Hell and that space film with Tom Allen and Siggy Weaver in), kind of irritated the crap out of me as he does in most of his films... He is really starting to get on my wick, he needs to grow as an actor, expand a little... take a leaf out of Tom Hanks book...If you want to watch a movie with a few mates after a good drink, this probably isn't it, but if you want to watch a movie that will cause some debate after a nice game of Trivial Pursuit, then you can't do much worse than this..Enjoy!",After.Life

Spoiler alert,10,19 October 2010,"I have had it with these suspense or horror films that are shot in dark rooms, dark houses, dark places, at night, in the darkest of places, dark, dark, dark, etc. Ugh. Enough already. This is a welcome change. Very beautifully shot in cool, smooth, bright lights. The director deserves an award. Seriously. Very good script, too. It really makes you ask yourself, What have I done with my life? Have I just existed or really lived? Have I loved more? Why be afraid? If you're going to make mistakes, make them. Success comes after. Be happy. Live, learn, laugh, like, and love. Liam Neeson seems to be compensated with the loss of his dear wife by being in yet another great film - he did well in Taken and the ultra-underrated Chloe. He's on a streak. This is also Christina Ricci's best role to date. Some may find her being in her birthday suit for most of her screen presence a bit too bold and I agree; sometimes I thought I was watching a porno film with a plot. And then there's the script and the dialog. A worthy imitation of the Sixth Sense, though it seems that my favorite M Night Shamalayan - did I spell that correctly? - film won't ever be topped. Kudos to all. And Justin Long - he lost his love in Drag Me To Hell, and yet again in this baby. Better luck on your next role. And if it's any consolation, yes, you did well too. Liam's Deacon shows that he's not some lecherous character but one who genuinely cares about his clients and takes his job seriously.

62,davdecrane,Extremely disappointing,2,8 November 2009,"There's a mystery here and it centers on how these actors got involved with such a slow, uneven mishmash of a script. The story is not so much a blend of genres as a slow, boring plot looking for a genre home. It's not a horror film or thriller or serial-killer piece or supernatural mystery although elements from all these arenas arise at one time or another. Subplots led by a creepy kid and the broken-hearted boyfriend lead nowhere, further adding to a sense of frustration. The movie's only idea -- and it's as vague and pretentious as it sounds -- is that Liam Nesson is some sort of arbitrary God-like dealer in Fate. His performance is one-note, though suitably oleaginous for a creepy undertaker. Justin Long goes through all the motions with no real conviction, but again, what could the vacuous script possibly provide? The little boy, Chandler Canterbury is the kind of child actor who appears to take a deep breath before each take and hope things turn out all right. Only Christina Ricci comes through -- or has a chance of displaying any range. She looks good and is convincingly upset and befuddled by her circumstances, a feeling the audience never overcomes. But she's always interesting to look at; even more here where she's naked for much of the picture -- an American actress braver than most her contemporaries when it comes to material and nudity (see Black Snake Moan). Unfortunately she's guessed wrong with both her commitment and disrobing for this turkey. Pic has competent production values but a low-budget feel with limited locations, extras, and automobile accidents that occur after blackouts in a Lifetime-movie way. Even the title is silly and pretentious but remember it. It'll pop up on a few Worst Movies of the Year lists.",After.Life

The idea of someone stripping and handling and generally disposing of a body and all the associated indignities truly repulses me. I found the nudity of Christina Ricci a little exploitative it could have been more balanced with the character of Justin Long being similarly exposed. Also I found some of the lines that the young boy is involved with a little distasteful. I don't really think it will do a lot for that young child to have to deal with the grim and harsh realities of death so graphically. I was always a little concerned with the plots of ""two and a half men"" and the ugly sleazy aspects that the youngster had to deal with, and now as an adult he has discussed that it did have a detrimental affect on him.

If it focused on them for half of the film, I would have cared more about their outcomes. In addition, they wasted Nissen's talent and he was not the least bit creepy and was not believable at all.

68,FrankDamage,A freshly dug grave isn't the only hole here....,5,18 September 2011,"It's an interesting premise to be certain (perhaps one inspired by scenes in 2001-2005's ""Six Feet Under,"" in some way?), but even with the acting merits of Neesen carrying the majority of the show, including Ricci's performance at times (literally at one point), I reluctantly think that its one that might be best buried. Though not at all entirely forgotten.I too was among those who were delighted and perhaps even captivated with one of Miss Ricci's earliest ""morbid"" themed undertakings; ""The Addams Family."" As many may remember in that film, Ricci convincingly plays a very detached, seemingly indifferent and cold little girl. Though a relatively intelligent one.In this story we see her portray a woman with the same characteristics, except for the intelligence. This could be seen as the first of several flaws in this film, due to the fact that her character is supposed to be an elementary school teacher. Though while such a position doesn't necessarily DEMAND that a person be caring, warm and loving, or an ""Einstein"" intellectually either, there are some minimal requirements to making the character a convincing one. Luckily for Christina in this movie, she spends the majority of the time playing a role that I now realize (after still being a fan for so many years) she seems best suited for; a corpse.The character's initial lack of emotion and apparent detachment is later elaborated on through the course of the picture. However one particularly ""passionate"" outburst earlier in the film seems noticeably lacking later, when it would/should be called for most. None the less, her presence is again captivating throughout her scenes, but some might argue its more due to her costume, or lack there of.Neesen's delivery as a kindly mortician who can apparently speak to the dead, is fortunately carried throughout the course of the story believably, even to expansion, as an integral point to the plot.While Justin Long's presence in a serious dramatic role might by now be a staple for some, to me he will always project the image of a near-do-well buffoon. Perhaps this lingering impression is from some of his earlier roles and thus initially makes him appear ill-suited for the role required. Though I will now say he does a decent job here in shaking off some of that/those previous character type casts.Overall the aesthetics, cinematography, direction and performances of the three main characters are good, to very good. However as touched upon in the title of this review, as well as my remarks on Ricci's representation of her character, there are several more holes in this plot than a small town graveyard might be able to accommodate.Still with all said, it is worth taking a look at for the many merits noted. Of course fans of Miss Ricci's adult acting ""talents"" should be inclined to take one more look at ""the body,"" because you never know when, or if, a Hollywood starlet will be buried.

As other uses have said it starts OUT with a promising premise (but you have to TOTALLY suspend your disbelief, especially if you know anything about EMS and know that trauma victims with no autopsy generally don't go to the funeral home, but oh well), but then SLOWS DOWN and gets TEDIOUS.Basically we (and she) have to figure out, wait..is she dead? The funeral director says, she is, but has not ""crossed over"" yet, and he has the ""gift"" to help people that won't let go do so. Eh, Ghost Whisperer. OK. So, we go back and forth for awhile ""I'm not dead!"" ""Yes you are...accept it."" etc. and we want to get into the story but start thinking....as other users have pointed out...wait...she's trapped in there for days...no food...no water....no um...powder room...no leg stubble (lol). Now you can go awhile without food, but NOT water. People have pointed out, well when you're very ill, etc....but still.So we have Eliot (Neeson, trying to convince her she's dead, Anna pretty sure she isn't, her boyfriend not so sure either, and so on.

Made for $4.5 million, grossed about $100,000 in theatrical release. For once the public were right to neglect a thoroughly incompetent attempt at a horror movie.Where to begin? Start with an artless script that remains implausible from its grand design, to its subplots, to individual scenes. I might be able to suspend disbelief about a talk therapy mortician and his indecisively dead clients, but the subplots really were preposterous. Christina Ricci and Whatshisname, the forgettable leading man, had no plausible basis for a romantic relationship. No Orpheus and Euridice here, more like a 20-something George and Martha. And how does a grown man violently assault an 11 year old in a public school and not go to jail? What's with the creepy 11 year old in the first place, except as added ornament? Do we also need a necrophiliac cop? CGI dream sequences that look like they were programmed on an Atari 64? Other objects of derision. Liam Neeson's two note performance.

I guess that falls short from being a cure all redeeming feature though. In a nutshell, we have a good cast in an inconclusive film. Some of the plot appears unnatural. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD:For example the quarrel scene at the dinner, felt over the top and forced,with Ricci's character to be acting as a puppet following a script ,rather than a true person responding to the actual events taking place. More importantly though,many contradictory facts prevent the viewer from reaching a certain conclusion as to the central question of the whole plot, which remains unresolved until the very end. Is the protagonist dead or alive after her car accident? The simple answer is that you cannot give an answer, because there are some very important contradictory facts that render both versions unreasonable! If she was alive why couldn't she be heard by her fiancé over the phone when she finally reached one? It couldn't have been the ( almost astronomical) coincidence of a bad line at the particular instance(she heard him just fine) because Neeson's character appeared calm and certain at the particular scene that she wouldn't be heard properly. He wouldn't have sabotaged his own office Phone ( otherwise working in the rest of the film) since the eventuality that Ricci's character ( locked in the basement) would reach a phone in the house could not have been anticipated. The stealing of the keys was not intended by him and actually came to him as a major surprise. Once it was discovered by chance a few minutes after-wards it led to his rushing back home.If on the other hand she was dead, how could she then pick up things or break them or breathe etc. Notwithstanding the supernatural explanation that (only) the Neeson character could ""talk"" to the dead, how could they mobilize, move around and interact with the environment even in his absence? It is clear that none of these actions were parts of a dream sequence.It doesn't matter that the ""she is alive "" clues are eventually more ( and far more obvious) than the ""she is dead"" clues. The film makers manage the impossible : Without introducing in any way the ""zombie"" notion, they exclude both possibilities.In David Lynch's films there is such quality that you feel instinctively that there has to be an explanation ( or more ) that could make sense of it all.The question is not whether there is an explanation but which one is the more suitable? In this film you begin and finish with a ""what the ..."" and before halfway, you simply know from the glaring inconsistencies piling up, that the director blew it and won't be getting out of the mess she made of things. And unavoidably, you stop caring about what happens to the obviously neither dead nor alive character played by beautiful Ricci. Despite the ( many) naked scenes...",After.Life

Having said that Liam Neeson did a scarily convincing job as an undertaker but other than his contribution the acting was dire and the script had all the flair of a parts list for a washing machine. If Liam Neeson were not in this movie then I would have struggled to have voted any higher than 1 out of 10. What happened to the screen writers, were they all on strike?

76,harfordamanda,dreadful...and not in a good way,4,29 August 2010,"*EXTREME SPOILERS!!*I will admit the movie did have some key points that I enjoyed, very POEesque but all in all I honestly have to say I'll never watch it again. The story is very simple, very clean cut: a woman (Anna),a teacher, who finds no real happiness in life ""dies"" and fights to live but then it get complicated. You end up with a overly calm mortician (Deacon) who claims that he can speak to the dead and keeps assuring this woman who's walking and talking in his morgue that she's dead and she just needs to let go although she's insistent that she's alive. The movie, throughout most of it,tries to convince you that yes, she's dead and that she's basically a ghost although as the movie progresses you realize that's not the case. It tries to cover that fact up through the grieving boyfriend (Paul). He's having visions, strange dreams and can't come to grasps with her ""death"". The key moment that really sets the plot off is when Deacon won't let Paul see Anna's body because she's down in the morgue screaming for Paul who can't hear her of course. There are several attempts to keep the audience guessing about her real condition but they fall severely short and half way through the film you know exactly what's going on thanks mostly to the paralyzing drug that Deacon keeps giving her. To put it in perspective, it's a prologue to ""Premature Burial"" although done rather poorly. The only saving grace is that Liam Neeson (Deacon) plays his role flawlessly. I was mesmerized by his performance and was disappointed that his character was underplayed in the story while Christina Ricci's character (Anna) was overly exploited throughout the film. I wanted desperately to know the why's and what of Deacon's character from his point of view but instead the director felt it better for an 11 year old boy (Jack),who was Anna's student and local weird kid, to interpret Deacon's complex nature. The target was missed by an hour and a mile. I think in the hands of another director maybe Burton or Shyamalan the movie could've lived up to it's potential and what the film was trying to convey but instead we're left with a diet sixth sense.",After.Life

Even that was by design, I guess.Dream sequences are great, they usually work for me. In this movie there were a couple of dream sequences that probably didn't fit with either of the primary postulates of the movie; Dead? or Alive? Maybe the biggest problem I had with the movie is that it doesn't answer the question of whether she was dead all along or perhaps buried alive. It carries that question throughout the movie, right to the end, and leaves it unanswered. A viewer might see it one way or the other, but for me the movie doesn't answer that central question.Having said all of that: Liam Neesom plays a very convincing mortician/funeral director, Christina Ricci did a great job with one of the most demanding roles in the history of film, and the film was beautifully shot.I know mortuary science is an everyday occurrence but this is one creepy movie.",After.Life

They didn't appreciate life, so by his opinion - they were long dead on the inside, wasting the air from the people who actually wanted to live.The boy, following his logic, took that one chick from the beginning of the movie, that was weaker from the rest of the bunch, put it in a shoe box while still alive, and buried it (because, well, it was not as strong as the rest of the chicks and ""didn't want to fight for survival"" like others. Therefore, in his mind (as Liam convinced him), the chick was already dead.So, both Christina and Justin were alive when they found themselves in mortuary.

The little boy cast as Jack I thought to be exceptionally good as well as the mother. Those two didn't get a lot of screen time but what they had really built the story and moved it along.The premise is a school teacher who wakes up in a funeral home and is told by the mortician she has died. He can hear and speak to her because he has a gift. The young woman believes she is still alive and it becomes her struggle to discern what is really happen. To that point, we the viewers, are left to discern it, too. Is the caretaker a clairvoyant with these gifts who followed her car because he knew she was about to die; is he only a kindly man burdened with the terrible task of helping the dead cross over ? Is he a serial killer drugging her and keeping her confused to drag out her agony before burying her? Throughout the film, we're given subtle evidence that supports both ideas but there's never a solid 'conclusion' that answers the question.An odd aside, but i remember watching as Ms. Ricci's character is preparing for her funeral and thinking 'Who does funeral make up like that?"" she looked as if she was going clubbing.Many reviews complain about the pacing of the film, and I do agree, it plods along terribly slow in many places.

She plays such severe, yet sassy characters as well as light-hearted characters like Penelope the pig-nosed girl in Penelope and Katrina Van Tassel in The Sleepy Hollow. Now, do they shock anyone any less or make her any less of an actress? No, she should open up her repertoire. But, it is kind of hard to watch her play these sweetheart roles any less? Heck Yes!!! As I promised, I sat through Afterlife and now I am going to write you about it. Basically, the story is about an elementary school teacher named Anna Taylor who has for some reason has become very distant in life. Probably, it could be her ice- her-veins mother or maybe she is dead. I, mean all be it if you awake up in a morgue and yet you can breathe. You can also see by her ability to move and talk that she must be dead. Well, it couldn't be her looks those have be there since birth, people. They are not going away. Sorry about that Christina Ricci. Anyways, it starts when Ana Taylor and her boyfriend, Paul Coleman played by Justin Long, are together in bed and some reason Ana jumps out of bed and runs right into the shower. They have a discussion about him not being enough for each other and Ana says that she is fine. Later that day, Anna and Paul go out to dinner at a real posh restaurant. And before Paul could make a proposal, Anna takes off in her car and gets in a car crash. Then, she wakes up in a morgue staring up at the local morgue director who tells her that she is dead while he injects her with some kind of muscle relaxer. Well, I guess I will try to remember that the next time I need a shot when I'm dead. He keeps repeating over and over again ""just because a person is born, they are alive."" Well, that isn't the exact quote. But, this is a kid's site as well and I got family members reading this as well. But, as the movie goes on, Paul starts to consider that Anna isn't dead. This is well after she figures it out for herself and killed by the morgue director. Anyways, he goes off and rescues her from to only be killed by the Morgue Director.

87,Superdessucke,Good but marred by a few cheap plot shots,6,19 July 2020,"This is solid thriller that does its job keeping you in the edge of your seat, albeit by interjecting a few clues that do not make sense in retrospect. The cast is solid. Liam Neeson is great as the ""is he gifted or a serial killer?"" undertaker. Christina Ricci does a great job keeping us interested in and supportive of her troubled character. Justin Long's character was totally grating, in my opinion, but that could be by direct design.The whole film is of course about whether the protagonist is still alive after a car accident and being tortured and killed by a devious serial killer, or has died and being helped transition into the afterlife by a man granted a peculiar gift.I didn't rate the film higher because it uses some inexplicable and arguably cheap plot points to keep the audience guessing on that central premise. For example, if Ricci was really dead, how could she take Neeson's keys and break one in the lock? And why would he be so concerned as to race back to the mortuary when he discovered this? And what about the breath on the mirror? How could she be dead and still breathing?And why was Neeson's van following Ricci's car just before the wreck? Does he have psychic ability in addition to the ability to speak with the dead? He did observe her at her music teacher's funeral earlier that day, true. But how would he know where she'd be that night and that she was going to be driving so distractedly? And if he caused the crash, how would he erase that from Ricci's memory?And of course, above all, the Neeson character makes a few noticable comments during the film which imply that Ricci is not ""physically"" dead but only dead in spirit and that he is doing the world a favor by ridding the world of such awful people. There are a few other clues to this effect as well.Perhaps there's a deeper meaning to this plot point. It certainly makes the Neeson character much less likable and makes the viewer lean strongly towards serial killer. Though to be fair, frustration on and bitterness on his part over having such a terrible ""gift"" would certainly be understandable. But if that were true, then why would he continue to work as a mortician? And keep pictures of the people on his wall? I'd personally stay as far away from a funeral home as possible if I had the ""gift"" and resented it, much less keep a wall of pictures to remind me of it each day.Anyway, aside from those things, this is a decent film that is definitely worth watching.

Unfortunately, I'm a little perplexed as to why they would be a part of this garbage called a ""film."" I can only suppose that the actors must be short on cash. This film was little more than a poor ""B"" movie that had Ricci walking about nude for most of her part. I've always considered her as the ""Johnny Depp"" of female actors. She often chooses cutting edge, in your face roles. This film is definitely in your face, but for all the wrong reasons. Liam should be embarrassed for participating is such garbage. The plot is high school level and completely predictable. There wasn't any suspense and watching Liam talk to a naked Ricci, for most of the film, isn't enough to capture my attention and it shouldn't be for anyone else either. Pure junk.",After.Life
92,xethannelsen,Decent movie.,7,30 October 2020,"I overall liked the movie. It really kept you guessing whether or not she is alive the intended time and the clues the films setup for us to decipher it are very well done. I leaned almost the entire time to that she was alive but I had many occasions I doubted my prediction and almost changed it.Neeson and Ricci are the main focus it seems and they were honestly the best part. I found the other characters neither great or bad but I didn't find myself caring about them too much. Maybe the boyfriend I was partly invested in but I feel they could have done more with him.My main issue was the ending. I wish it did have a happy ending. I felt we got so invested in Ricci's character and then she and her boyfriend dies. I also would have liked a more action packed climax of the film because it really was like the last 10 minutes or so. However for me to have like the dark ending, I wish we got to see a more evil Neeson at the ending with a little more gore.All in all, I give it a 7/10 but it may also be a 6/10. I've seen way worse movies than this but I have also seen way better movies so a 6-7/10 seems close enough to how I feel. I love the fact they give clues through out the film she is alive, even as early as the crash seeing the van. I also like the fact they do keep you guessing the entire time no matter how sure you are she is alive. The ending is really where it sort of seemed they faltered on.",After.Life

94,zhennis,Liam Neeson brings the dead to life in this film!!!!!,7,20 October 2010,"After-Life embraces the mystery/thriller sub-genre of the drama genre's style and refuses to relent even up to and after its conclusion. The film relies on the question of whether or not those in the funeral home are dead or only being led to believe they are dead. Despite having evidence for both sides of this issue displayed throughout the film, you will be left to decide for yourself as to which side you believe. It is possible that both scenarios occur actively in the film. This film has a ""Saw"" style of lesson-learning involved in the story. It seems that the inability to love is the motive in After-Life whereas the inability to live life is Jigsaw's motive.While the acting from Justin Long & Christina Ricci is on par with their other performances in recent history, Liam Neeson offer a performance that will rival his performance in Taken. Neeson is the reason this film is so suspenseful because he is able to create a character that can be viewed as delusional, insane, psychotic, or ""gifted"" without forcing the audience to believe only one of these characteristics.Entertainment wise this film is not a blockbuster but connects many good directorial and cinemagraphical elements. The musical score is as eerie as John Carpenter's Halloween score. There is not much bad that can be said about this film. The shot choices are sensible and simple without being overtly creative. This is a film that allows the story to evolve on its own and the actors to the story its character.",After.Life

It kept you guessing till the very end...and then it went to crap. I'm so sick of movies having sad endings, or stupid endings, which is exactly what this movie ended with. Was she dead, alive? What? And the answer was obviously alive, Liam Neeson was obviously a serial killer, and obviously if Justin Long or Christina Ricci had been any smarter, she would have figured it out, killed Liam Neeson, and we would have had a happy ending. It just didn't fit at the end with the characters at all. Also, if you were burying a coffin, 20 bucks says you could hear somebody screaming and yelling from inside of it!

97,chunky_lover_68,You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't count anymore.,6,25 July 2010,"I was all ready to write this Christina Ricci horror flick off as some form of low budget sixth sense film, but towards the end what it couldn't achieve in suspense or shock it achieved in mystery and left a film that is open for debate on the case of Miss Anna Taylor, killed in a car accident, or was she? Anna wakes up on the slab and is greeted by the local Mortician Elliot who claims he can see the dead, although Anna seems to be talking. Several clues conflict both sides of their argument throughout the film, from foggy windows and feeling pain, to walking corpses and creepy kids; whether or not Anna is among the living or in the after life is the great debate left breathing among some very clichéd scares. Their were epic drops of water from the tap, followed by epic eye opening sequences, followed by obvious jump scares. It didn't innovate as a horror film; and doesn't really use it to it's best potential for the story. The make-up was pretty cool though, both for the decaying corpses but although the visual look, stark white with blood red and onyx black, the look was striking and kept the film vivid though it's merely decent portions. The final act of this film is it's best part where we are given a sneaky resolution to the clues against a possibly delusional mortician, or a possibly delusional fiancé, the end of this film is well handled and left me wondering about it into the credits. Had the film relied a lot less on obvious horror elements and went for something more realistic to make the film chilling, I would've been way more eager to recommend this film, unfortunately you have to slog though familiar scare tactics to get to a rather brilliant ending. That said if you scare easy you just might like this film. Proceed with caution.",After.Life

The on-going dialogue between Anna Taylor (Ricci) and Eliot Deacon (Neeson) was and excellent philosophical discussion of our purpose in life.Someone once said ""Died at 30, buried at 60"". Taylor pretty much summed this up with her bleak outlook of life, until faced with her mortality.Ricci was perfect in the Role of Taylor; the actress always seemed to be the ultimate Goth Girl in real life. It was unnerving to see Neeson in his role and I suppose that worked because I always thought of him taking ""good guy"" roles.Two thumbs up on this flick, for great acting, solid script and an eerie twist at the end.",After.Life

It has soooo many flaws and the director does not even explain them properly. There is no question whether the woman played by Christina Ricci was dead or alive because the director herself explains that she IS alive and we are meant to question this as we watch the film.Here are a few flaws: Christina Ricci trashes the place she is held captive and walks over broken glass, but does not bleed from it. She takes an eternity to open a door, so long that the captor (Liam Neeson) is able to go to the local gas station, put gas in his car, pay and get in his car again and drive back. He has a magic mirror that makes Christina Ricci look like she is dead and all gaunt. You question how the hell Liam Nesson was able to get the body in the first place if she's not supposed to be dead. There are times when the drug in Christina Ricci's body is wearing off, but she never feels anything. She never gets hungry either. I could go on, but it makes me angry thinking about them all.This film is also full of clichés and if you read the reviews by other people who didn't like it they also say the same.If you want to see a good thriller/horror do not see this.

But it is worse when the trailer misguides you. I am an amateur screenwriter, if I had presented this movie plot to someone in Hollywood, people would probably tell me to do something else - I am being euphemistic here. It is unbelievable that the last worthwhile horror movie I saw was ""The sixth sense"" (1999). ""The others"" (2001) was not bad either. Man, we bust our ""minds"" to come up with something good, rarely people give us a chance - amateur writers - then you go to the movies or rent a DVD and wonder how come someone spent money, time and did something mediocre like this? It is hard. Producers, please do some remake of good movies like ""Satan's Triangle"" (1975), just add some more ""verve"" and go for it.

It might be possible that by watching the movie a few times it goes from a 1/10 to perhaps a 2-3 but you can not expect anybody to dedicate that much time to understand a movie as horrible as this one. Liam Neeson is a great actor and does his part great though, but his character is poorly developed throughout the movie, something you could say about all of the other characters as well.

Even top-notch acting talent drown in a sea of nothing to do plot. The characters are so thinly drawn they have no substance and not even stereotypes for the audience to engage with. Long slow scenes play out where character development would have been perfect or exposition a blessed relief. But that's the issue, they have no depth of character, they have next to nothing to exposit so you end up watching tensionless scenes of blank, slow nothingness.With the characters so intentionally characterless even the finest of actors can only fail to fill the void left behind. I did like the premise and the mystery it raised but with little for the audience to do, with regard to joining dots for themselves, the vacant plot stands out all the more. A skilled director would have added more proactive side characters, more impetus and some sense of danger to scenes where appropriate...

What the hell is happening to her, is she taking the wrong pills, why is she so sad? All questions that popped into my mind and to which I really wanted an answer. The problem was, however, that most of these questions will not be answered.For example the bobbing head following Paul. Why was the camera zooming in on it if the only purpose is to creep out the viewer? It doesn't make any sense why these shots were taken. And why did we see the mother of the little boy Jack? What was her role in all of this? Why did all the lights go out and was Anna totally freaking out? Was it because of the pills she was taking? Or because she was already dead somehow? It made me think I totally missed something, but apparently I didn't. In my opinion the movie failed because of these unanswered questions.The fact that Anna is not dead and that Eliot is a psychopath, was clear to me way too early in the movie. Also.. when Paul is screaming at the door and all of the sudden Anna accepts that she is dead. What the hell was that about? This is THE moment to find out if Eliot is speaking the truth or not.The lines of Eliot were sometimes way to obvious and cliché. Also his outburst were not very convincing.. and the risks he takes with Anna attacking him are also very very illogical. The ending was so... so... stupid!! Paul being the next victim.. come on. Eliot teaching the little boy... really!? The whole movie they pretend to be deep about death.. and then this horror plot comes out. Weird. All and all I give this movie a 4 out of 5. 1. Acting 2.

There will be spoilers in this review so watch out :)The basic story of the movie concerns a young girl, clearly struggling with life and her relationships. After a car crash she 'awakens' in a mortuary only to be told that shes dead. The rest of the movie covers Liam Neeson (the undertaker)and his attempts to convince her that she is in fact dead and help prepare her for her funeral. But is she really dead?This movie is not about life after death. Its not about what happens when you die. This movie is about people not really living their lives, wandering through life like they're dead already. I think its fairly obvious that the main character is in fact very much alive when taken to the undertaker. Numerous clues point to this in the movie, breath on the mirror, the 'muscle relaxant' that shes injected with and the fact that shes walking around and has to be locked in :)and finally to confirm that Neeson is lying, in the final scenes he clearly kills the boyfriend. But the movie has several scenes that seem to ruin this, and push the film to seeming supernatural grounds. With numerous scenes, or nightmare scenes like the confrontation with her younger self, and the old woman's corpse walking and talking. These slightly detract from the overall focus of the storyline, but keep you guessing if she is alive or dead.In the end, this is a good movie, with an interesting story and direction, only slightly let down by some of the scenes.

It's a truly remarkable film.I'm not going to say much about the story (you really have to see it for yourself) but I will say that it's keeps you guessing right to the very end.The scary scenes were very powerful. Both shocking and beautiful. They reminded me of Dario Argento. Very lush and surreal. But mainly the film was very creepy. Liam Neeson really nailed the role of the funeral director -- one minute gentle and compassionate, the next minute sinister and extremely dark. Christina Ricci was brilliant. She's an incredible actress and soooo beautiful (and yes, she gets naked -- this film is definitely R rated!).

But later, thinking about the film (and having a major argument with my friend as to whether Christina Ricci was really dead or not) it's clear the film is a debut - there's a freshness and originality to the vision that marks it as a first feature. There were flaws (which is why I gave it a 9 rather than a ten). Some scenes seemed rushed and I missed seeing more of the world Christina Ricci inhabited, but I'm guessing that's probably more due to limited budget than limited film-making. The film was also very unsettling, not just because of the scares (although they added to the overall creepy mood) but also because of the world the director created inside the funeral home: there was something not quite right (old rotary phones, 50's clothing, decor etc.), something you couldn't quite put your finger on, that made me feel slightly uneasy throughout the film.

Seeing Liam Neeson as a funeral agent with some seemingly eerie skills of being able to talk to the dead was fascinating. As the progress went on tough it became a bit uncertain where things would go, was the girl really dead or just drugged? Ricci was beautiful, but the nudity felt at times too obvious even if it was enjoyable.The ending revealed a strange mix that confused more than it fascinated. The girl finally died for good, with her boyfriend as well, and the psycho-funeral agent lived on to kill another day - with the bonus of a young protégé. But the supernatural element was gone now, and that pretty much killed the whole movie for me.

These are bullshit..The only part of scariness i enjoyed was the 'doll' close to Colleman's bed following his steps (therefore it's absolutely non-sense the doll dirty with blood)..The only reason i enjoyed it (i almost slept in the middle) was because at the end it showed another thing i didn't expected.. and Liam Neeson is f**king great at the roleplay...",After.Life
117,gailhachenko,Gutsy and Involving,9,12 June 2011,"I can see why this fantastic movie has divided so many people. It's a mixed movie which has confused critics and audiences. For many, it is just a horror movie, for others a psychological thriller and for others like me, a masterpiece of ideas, involving intelligence, fantasy and a unique world of interpretations to discuss days after watching the movie. You're not ""invited"" to think during this movie, thinking is pretty much a necessity. It's that complex. But for those who are willing to give this a try, the experience is well worth your time and money.Anna Taylor (Ricci) is a school teacher who takes a interest with one of her students, Jack. Her fiancé Paul Coleman, (Long) can't pin-point what's making Anna so distant and when he asks her to marry him everything goes wrong. After a heated argument Anna storms out into a rain-slicked road ending up in the funeral home of Eliot Deacon (Neeson).Deacon tells Anna she's dead, or is she? As he starts to prepare her for her funeral while trying to convince her that he has powers and can talk to the dead, Anna can't shake of the feeling that she is indeed alive. Paul is also having trouble coming to terms with Anna's death, after he keeps ""feeling"" her around him.At several points in the movie, Anna tries to either kill and/or run away from where she is being held captive. After a failed attempt at killing Deacon with a sharp pair of scissors she slowly begins to go insane, or does she? With only three days left until her funeral, Deacon tries to help Anna transition into the afterlife with ease, or so he says. While trying to convince Anna and the audience if she's indeed dead or alive, the director creates a deliberate ambiguity so audiences never really know what is truly happening.Jack, who felt a strong connection to his teacher, gets curious and wanders outside the funeral home catching a glimpse of Ms. Taylor, or did he? While Paul goes back to collect Anna's things from school, Jack informs Paul that he saw Anna through Deacon's window, verifying Paul's insanity.Anna begins to accept her death, and confesses her need for happiness and her decision to not love in order not to get hurt. Throughout the movie, there are clues that lean towards both sides of the mystery. In one hand we can clearly see that Anna's breath is visible on the mirrors handed to her, but she indeed does look like a corpse, and goes through surreal episodes in her dreams, or does she? After.Life is intense film that forces audiences to re-examine not just what they've seen on the screen, but also re-examine there own lives. The movie asks; what does it mean to be dead? And what does it mean to be alive? A powerful movie with a powerful message.",After.Life

119,trancehunter,I think this is one that Liam Neeson probably wants to forget about....,3,28 August 2012,"The movie seems quite promising for the first part, the event that opens up the movie draws you in as a viewer, there is a sense of tension, mystery and creepiness. However this seems to dwindle off as the plot line becomes very rigid and basic, as a viewer I found that I became irritated by the weak characters, that show a lack of depth and initiative. The element of mystery dwindles, along with suspense and tension - as the movie remains slow, predictable and fairly simple, and therefore there is no development of any real feeling of worry, anxiety or fear that this kind of movie is supposed to create. On the one hand it attempts to be a psychological thriller, however there is nowhere near enough depth to the plot line or the characters to create a story complex enough to challenge the way you think or perceive the topic/personalities/scenario/events within the film which a good psychological thriller should do. On the other it attempts to delve into the horror genre by incorporating dark and eerie elements to the atmosphere, surroundings and movie scenes. Again these really aren't introduced in a sophisticated manner and their effects are weak, in fact some of these elements are far too disconnected from the actual plot to make sense of them, which only works to negate the effects of the potential psychological thriller elements of the film. Like many other films that are poorly executed, this one seems to attempt to incorporate a whole bunch of elements to a basic level in order to make up a film, rather than just concentrating on a few elements and making them deep and solid, which would have made more impact on me as a viewer overall. The biggest downfall for me was the ending, I am not going to spoil by explaining it, however I will say that the ending not only irritated me to a severe extent, but also made me feel like the film itself had achieved nothing and that I as a viewer therefore achieved absolutely nothing by watching it. The film really required a strong ending in order to redeem itself from the poorness it had displayed throughout, and as stated, it didn't. In terms of the script I cant really offer much of a comment as I cant really remember what it was like. Therefore I don't remember it for being particularly bad, but then again I don't remember it for being particularly good either! In terms of acting, Liam Neeson is definitely in my favourite top 100 and as always I couldn't fault his acting as he did the best anybody could do with the character he played. I will fault, however, the fact that he appeared in a film as poor as this as it really doesn't stack up to the caliber of any other movie that I have seen him star in. Aside from playing an irritating character, Cristina Ricci also acted well in her credit and I can't deny that despite thinking she is odd looking, I did think that she looked rather tight in a skimpy dress which for me was the only consolation for enduring such a poor film. So because of her the film gets 3/10 and not 2/10.In conclusion the idea behind the film had potential, however it remained too simplistic and flawed to create any real impact. If anything the film overall had a negative impact on me as the ending was frustrating.",After.Life

From injections that are supposed to relieve rigor mortis, yet require miraculous post mortem circulation, to scenes at the open casket funeral with Anna's, Christina Ricci, eyes twitching and her chest obviously heaving up and down while her boyfriend cries in disbelief that she is actually dead, the movie goes out of its way to let you know this person is not dead, but she might be just as happy if she were.I could have accepted all of these violations of common sense and logic if the end of the movie had also been as ambiguous as the main story line, but the ending is not ambiguous which makes the departures from common sense all the more maddening and cheap. We should never find out if Anna is really dead or alive because according to the movie it doesn't matter, we are just as dead when we are alive.",After.Life
121,sterlingfactory,Simply Spectacular,9,3 May 2016,"Anna, played by Christina Ricci, wakes up in the mortuary of the local funeral director, Liam Neeson. He tells her she's dead and he's preparing her body for her burial. What follows is thought-provoking and almost unbearably macabre. The actors were amazing, even Justin Long, and the directing stylish with a very distinctive look.This movie is not for everyone. People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart. But I'd recommend it to anyone who has a taste for dark humor and enjoys putting the pieces of the puzzle together over and over, long after the movie's ended. That said the movie never had a chance commercially. Combine the fact that most people are just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the ending is not tied up in a neat bow, and it's clear that this movie will stay underground. However, if you're looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, After.Life is just about as good as it gets.",After.Life

123,drewjohn-94895,Empty performances and a painful ending,3,18 June 2020,"Let me start by listing off the good parts about this film.
1. The concept: The idea of a morgue worker that has to bring the recently deceased to terms with their death could be very interesting movie
2. Liam Neeson: He was Liam Neeson. He brought some interest towards the character of the morgue worker and provided a ""not too bad"" performance.Those were the only likable things I found in the film. I will now make a list of my main problems with this film.
1. The suspense of belief: In the beginning of the film, we are told that Liam Neeson's character has a special ability to be able to talk with the dead and anyone else would merely see this dead girl's body as a what it is, a corpse. That would be fine if they stuck with those rules throughout the entire movie but they don't. There is a time when the dead girl trashes the morgue. She throws books, jars, needles, and other equipment all over the place and Liam Neeson has to clean it up. How does this work if she is just a dead body and Liam Neeson is the only one who can see her?
2. All of the performances except Liam Neeson: They all felt like your stereotypical one-dimensional movie characters. None of them have an arc. You think for a second that the dead girl has changed when she finally believes that she is dead but then at the end she goes right back to believing she is still alive.
3. The little boy's mother: There is a little boy in the movie who is very close to the dead girl, Anna, because she is his school teacher. Well throughout the movie we see his mother and it's implied that she's very sickly and you want to know why that is. The film never addresses this. It keeps giving you questions with no answers.
4. The Ending: During the movie, we are constantly changing our minds of whether Anna is actually dead or if Liam Neeson is just crazy. The least they could do is answer this question once and for all but they don't. All that happens is Anna's boyfriend also dies and ends up in the hand's of Liam Neeson after which the movie ends. Maybe this movie was trying to be subtle and ambiguous, which in some movies is fine, but this movie in no way earned it. It never makes a lick of sense, constantly feeds you questions, and then never answers anything. This movie feels like it was only made to promote a sequel that never happened.",After.Life

126,robsmith-64258,Totally rubbish,1,13 August 2021,This is the most ridiculous movie. I hate this film with a passion. If you thought you was being held against your will. You would fight for your life. Stupid stupid stupid.,After.Life
127,Rizzlie,"Good idea, great actors, but the film just has too many flaws.",3,11 August 2010,"I understand that this is a film that will divide opinions. Perhaps it is intelligent. Perhaps it has a most wonderful, original idea for a movie that made me rent it in the first place. Perhaps Liam Neeson and Christina Ricci are wonderful actors. But it doesn't change the fact that the film simply has too many flaws. You can accept a few in an otherwise good film, but having too many of them simply destroys the atmosphere. That is precisely what happened in this case, in my opinion.Allow me to elaborate. George Lucas once said that a movie doesn't have to follow the rules of our reality in order to be believable, it just needs to follow the rules of its own reality. This is exactly where this movie fails. It creates an unexplained horror world where something absurd happens every now and then: lights go out every time a lady walks past them with a big noise until the whole corridor has turned black (how cliché is THAT?!), plastic bumping head starts suddenly moving for no apparent reason, following a guy when he is walking. I wish the movie would have at least allowed me to believe that it was something the characters imagined in their heads, as in some other, more respectable scenes. But no, the guy didn't even see the lifeless bumpy head moving, it just did so for no apparent reason. What is so ""psychologically thrilling"" about that? These kinds of events go on and on. For example, after the might-be-dead lady escapes from the man holding her as prisoner, she suddenly starts bumping into walls (in a straight corridor!) and making a terrible noise. Possibly we are supposed to assume that she is so scared she has become hysteric, but then again she didn't seem hysteric either in the previous or in the following scene, nor is she in any immediate danger - the guy holding her as prisoner isn't really threatening in any way.The words ""for no apparent reason"" are key words for several events in this movie. Believibility requires a reason for a cause. This movie doesn't provide them, just irregular events placed around the plot - events that more often than not don't affect the plot any way, I might add.The most disturbing part for me, however, was the way it dealt with the questions of life and death. It tries to talk about in-depth questions - what happens to us when we die, and are we really that alive when we live our pathetic fear-run lives, and so forth - but ends up stating clichés such as ""we die to make life more meaningful"" or something along those lines. Something we have heard billion times before in every funeral (or B-class drama movie) we've gone to. The movie is filled with tons of other clichés as well - along the lines of ""you are more afraid of living than of dying"", and a small child telling the woman ""I am you"" when she asks who the kid is in her nightmare (or whatever you call them weird visions all the characters keep getting every now and then), and so forth. And the worst part is, these clichés just won't stop! There is hardly any action, just line after line, and EVERY SINGLE LINE seems to be one I've heard a dozen times before! I wonder if the screenwriters were on strike when this film was scripted, because a good idea just falls flat this way.And finally - what exactly happens to a person when he/she dies? The question of whether he/she will go on living as a spirit of some sort is an intriguing question. That is a question that doesn't seem to concern this movie at all. The question that does concern this movie - whether the body can go on living, running in the hallways and throwing stuff around - is not an intriguing one, not to me at least. Sure, one could respect it in a 50's style zombie-horror-movie. And if this was one, I might accept it. But this isn't one. This is supposed to be an intellectual movie raising intellectual questions about life and death. To assume that we should even consider the possibility that a MATERIAL BODY jumping around throwing things (and BREATHING, for Christ's sake) could be DEAD, is underestimating the intelligence of the same audience for whom the movie is sold to as an ""intelligent psychological thriller"".All of the above is more or less absurd. And I am a person who finds absurdity amusing. I suppose one could respect a movie for making one burst out a laughter every few minutes. But if its unintentional, there seems to be something wrong with either the script or directing (sometimes acting, too, but not in this case). Seriously, I did laugh every now and then. Out loud too, not just inside my head. And an ""intelligent psychological thriller"" shouldn't make you do that.Liam Neesom is a wonderful actor - once again. That gives this film two stars. Third one for a good attempt to create something original - even though in my eyes the attempt somewhat failed in this case. I would love to give more stars to an original and a clever idea, but every time I try to go for the fourth a picture of the moving plastic head bumps into my head and once again I begin to laugh.",After.Life

After seeing it I think this film has nothing to do with after life but about life itself, and how we live it. Maybe we are dead already. Are we living it? or just let life pass through us?Spoiler alert!Anna was afraid to love, and so she lived without any passion. We all let things die in us, specially feelings, and most of us don't do what we want for fear of suffering, like she did.

129,zombiegurl212,Extraordinary and stunningly beautiful,10,9 November 2009,"This movie completely blew me away. It's not your ordinary Hollywood genre film, it's literally extra-ordinary. Yes, it's a genre film. And yes, it has gory scenes and some very scary scenes. But it's the overall creepiness of the film that really gets under your skin. I literally cannot stop thinking about the film and still get shivers thinking of it.It also has some hilarious dark humor. The director subtly pokes fun at some of the clichés of horror/thriller films. Like when a police officer comes to see his brother's corpse. You think he's going to save Anna (Christina Ricci) but what happens is so darkly twisted that it will literally take your breath away! Liam Neeson was particularly good as the sinister undertaker. He has this amazing presence. I also was pleasantly surprised by how good Justin Long was. It's not his usual role and he was exceptional.But more than anything else this is a stunningly beautiful film. The colors and visuals of the movie are extremely powerful and really help create a weird and very creepy world.An extraordinary film. Definitely catch it when it's released in cinemas!",After.Life
130,stamford4230,Thoughtful & Provocative,10,8 November 2009,"It's a rare pleasure to come across a genre film that's both original and beautifully made. At one level it's a tightly made horror thriller with enough scares and creepy moments to keep the most ardent horror fan happy. But at another level it's also a thoughtful and provocative examination of what it's like to be dead -- or more importantly, what it's like to not be living.The film starts by following a young woman, Anna (Christina Ricci) trying to cope with her depression and a relationship that appears to be falling apart, and the local funeral director, Eliot (Liam Neeson) as he prepares for a funeral. The opening sets up a suspenseful inevitability that Anna's and Eliot's paths will soon cross.But it's when Anna has a car crash and wakes up on Eliot's slab that the film really kicks into high gear. Eliot calmly tells her she's dead and he's preparing her body for her funeral. Despite Anna's pleas that she's still alive, Eliot's chilling calmness convinces us that Anna is really dead. Eliot has a gift. He can talk to the dead to help them transition to the afterlife.It's a fascinating premise. A funeral director helping people come to terms with their death and the regrets of their life so they can be finally at peace and move on. Anna asks if she's ghost, and we sense that perhaps she is. That maybe ghosts are only transitory during the period between death and moving on to an afterlife.But as the film progresses, Eliot's behavior becomes more sinister. And as the film literally becomes darker, Eliot's motives become less clear. Is Anna really dead? Or is Eliot drugging her so she only thinks she's dead? The answer is surprisingly evasive. At one stage I thought she was definitely dead but then subtle clues made me think she was alive... and then 10 minutes later I was convinced again she was dead! The strength of the film is that you're never quite sure until the very end.The performances were incredible. Liam Neeson's looks were enough to send chills down my spine. An amazing actor. Christina Ricci was very convincing and very sexy! And Justin Long was surprisingly good in a serious role (although the film was also darkly humorous in places).A strong, intelligent story. Great performances. But it was the overall look that really blew me away. Beautiful colors and striking visuals -- especially with Anna in a vibrant red slip lying on a white slab in a cold gray room. Stunning! This unusual and very original film will not be to everyone's taste, but audiences who enjoy thoughtful, provocative film-making will be delighted to find something in the theaters that's not a gore-fest or comic book.",After.Life
131,fullerjo,Great Commercial Film,10,9 November 2009,"Me and my boyfriend were lucky enough to get tickets to the film in Santa Monica. We both loved the movie. We saw quite a few movies at AFI, including all the big gala movies like The Road (which was kind of disappointing) and Precious, and this one stood out (it also got more applause at the end than the Road and Tom Ford's film).The premise of the movie is fascinating and well executed: what happens when we die? It's one of the great mysteries of life and one that people have been contemplating for centuries. Agnieszka Vosloo's take is very original and very compelling: there's a transitional period between our death and when we buried. A period when we have time to reflect on our past and come to terms with our death (and life!).It's an intelligent film but also a highly commercial one. Great performances from an A list cast. Liam Neeson in particular was devastatingly good in the lead role as the funeral director. He was believable as both a kind-hearted ""angel"" helping people transition to the afterlife, and as a sinister ""psycho"" who may be burying people alive. Both interpretations were equally plausible (we never know the ""truth"" until the very end of the film (and even then my boyfriend was convinced she was dead all the time while I think she was alive!).An intelligent, scary, creepy, stunning, visual movie!!! It should be a huge hit if well marketed. I can't wait for it to come to the cinemas (hopefully soon) so I can watch it again. This is definitely the sort of movie that you could watch more than once and discover fresh things on each viewing. I haven't heard of this director before but, based on this film, she'll surely have a great career ahead of her. I can't wait to see what she does next.",After.Life

I'm glad she did.Finally a film that doesn't treat audiences as complete morons. It's intelligent, sexy and very chilling. It also made me think about my own life and perhaps there's some changes I should make before it's too late.And although I'm not the typical audience for Hollywood genre films, properly marketed this film could resonate with more mature audiences - and make an absolute bomb (we do go to movies as well).",After.Life
133,haroldthompson74,Very Retro!,10,10 November 2009,"Loved this film! Very very retro. Very 50s horror thriller. The AFI site said Liam Neeson was like a modern Vincent Price and I totally agree. The clothes, the phones, the colors were all a homage to the classic horror films of the 50s and 60s. The director was also clearly ""poking gentle fun"" at the whole horror genre in some of the scenes and the dark twisted humor was awesome! From the Q&A afterwards Christina and Justin obviously had a lot of fun making this music (Christina's comment about taking off her clothes brought the house down!). It's a smart, modern, sexy film with great scares and great visuals. The acting was stellar as well. Loved Liam: man that guy's got a scary chilling look.

Normally I don't add comments or even vote on IMDb (laziness being the main reason) but this film has stuck in my head more than any film I saw at AFI or AFM (or in fact any film I've seen in the last year).On the surface it's a genre film and all the genre elements are there - it's scary, creepy and very chilling. But it's much more than that. It deconstructs the genre with both humor and respect. The director is obviously a genre fan, and shows respect for the genre conventions while poking gentle fun at it.And as a genre piece it works extremely well. There's a forbidding menace hanging over every scene that gets deep under your skin. Liam Neeson as the Funeral Director is tremendous and makes the duality of the character very believable. Justin Long is also a revelation - he can do serious acting! But overall I think it's the message of the film that stays in your head. What does it mean to be dead?

A miraculous drug that works hours (and even days) After.Death (ha,ha) on a ""dead"" body, which presumably has no circulation (hint, hint).

A hidden, and never dealt with (why bother with details?), conspiracy of cops, hospitals, doctors, paramedics, to provide an apparently endless supply of freshly ""deceased"" body to our ""heroe"", with all the paperwork properly done.

Contradictions like ""people have to die to provide space for the ones who really want to live"" but, nevertheless, you do kill the only character that, throughout the whole movie, seems to try to have a life (the boyfriend/fiancé).Add all the above ingredients, throw in good production values, competent acting from the two lead actors, at least, plus a competent soundtrack, and you end up with a plot with no suspense, no depth, no development, no (satisfactory) end.

136,lisaletendre,is he? is she?,5,23 February 2013,I had to be middle of the road with marks out of ten. That's how the movie left me feeling. Is she dead? Is the little boy's mother dead? Is this a supernatural film or is the funeral director just a good old fashioned serial killer? Are his words meant to soothe the dead or is he justifying his motives for killing them? Is the little boy a future serial killer? Did he kill his mother as did the funeral director? Or did the mother die of natural causes and the little boy can speak with the dead as well? Is the boyfriend so distraught with grief and guilt that he's hearing things or is his dead girlfriend really trying to reach him? The cop that went to see his brother in the funeral home. When he goes over to her was he trying to determine if she was dead or not or was he just being a perve as well and copping a feel?? So many times I will watch a movie right to the end keeping an open mind hoping that the final twist will blow my mind only to be let down by the 'answer'. Then I want the hour or so I just wasted given back to me or any money I may have spent refunded. Is it a tongue-in-cheek horror film with hammy clichéd performances?

137,harryhotspur68,A Question of Life and Death,8,10 January 2010,"A woman, Anna (Christina Ricci) wakes up in a funeral home and is told by the undertaker (Liam Neeson) she's dead. Debut filmmaker Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo sets up an interesting premise, and as the story unfolds we're never quite sure whether Anna is indeed dead, and unable to come to terms with her death. Or whether she's in fact alive, and the victim of a very sick undertaker. You'll have to watch it yourself to find out the answer, and there's enough twists and turns to keep most audiences guessing until the very end.The film is well made and ambitious for an indie film. The director handles the genre scares and thrills with the assured skill of a veteran, yet refreshingly poses some interesting and awkward questions about life and death and the fragile line that separates them. However, the main reason I've given this film an 8 rather than a 9 or 10, is that I'd have liked to have spent more time on the intriguing question about what happens when you die. It's a powerful question. I suspect the producers were more interested in genre scares than thoughtful analysis. Still an amazing film and one I'd highly recommend",After.Life

The type of film you have to see twice so you know what to watch for and enjoy piecing together the puzzle long after the movie has ended. After.Life is like an illusionist misdirecting an audience while the all the time the truth lies plainly in sight.But be warned, this film is not for everyone.

The story has many faults and is more European than Hollywood -- and the narrative has frustrated many reviewers and audiences. But the film also has tremendous power which I salute. With a more classic narrative script, this director could have had a hit on her hands... but then would it have been so unique? I don't know.

After.Life looks like an art film but has tremendous scenario. It dares to ask intelligent questions and answer the questions in unpredictable ways. It is not a horror story but sublime existential examination of life and fear we have of missing out on something. ""If only.."" we say. ""If only I had more money, or more attractive, or a better house"". We spend lives dreaming but not living. Is Eliot (Liam Neeson) the judge and executioner?

I'm giving this movie a 3 purely based on the fact I saw Christine Ricci bare all for about 30% of its duration and that in itself deserves some credit. The movie itself has a great premise but utterly fails to follow through as it has so many obvious plot holes. The audience is constantly left questioning scenes from start to end as the story tries to be far smarter than it actually is.It's really the sort of movie that by the end of it your just kinda peeved off by the stupidity of it all instead of being wowed by the mind blowing conclusion and questions of mortality it tries to deliver on.,After.Life

It's a clever, smart indie thriller that twists and turns like a well oiled roller coaster. Look at the message board. Huge discussions on whether Anna (Christina Ricci) was dead or not. And a lot of smart people picking up clues that I completely missed (I guess I should watch it again). The acting was superb particularly Liam Neeson whose understated menace was chilling. But best of all was the overall stylish atmosphere the director created. Cool and a little unsettling. The movie has flaws, mainly in the narrative flow, but I'm being kind and presuming that was a function of budget rather than talent. I have a sneaking feeling this film will become a cult classic like Donnie Darko. I just wish studios would make more movies like this.

So many films this year have been so tame and lame it's refreshing to come across a movie that's so different and so provocative. Different because it refuses to follow a classic narrative. Provocative because it dares to leave questions in the audience's mind. Most people will hate the ambiguity (in fact you just have to read some of the reviews here) but for some it will a welcome respite from the dumb (and getting dumberer) movies out there. The answers to the riddle that is at the heart of this movie are all there, as well as quite a few red herrings and slight of hand.

More important and meant with all do respect, I really enjoyed Christina Ricci's tastefully done nude scenes.

I love films like this that make us think about something from another perspective, such as death. When do we die? Is it when our heart stops, or when we stop living our lives to the fullest? Could you come to terms with your own death if you where in Anna's (the main character's) place? Are we really alive if we're so guarded against pain that we completely stop feeling? These are all really good philosophical questions posed by the movie. Here's how I believe the movie ended. I think that Liam Neeson's character was a serial killer, and that Anna (Christina Ricci) was alive the whole time. There was a little boy in Anna's class, and you could tell he was creepy and strange from the beginning, and in the end it looks like he has become Neeson's protégé. Throughout the film a lot of evidence was given for both the argument that she was dead, and the argument she wasn't. Before I watched the film, I had read that the ending was kind of ambivalent, but I personally thought it was clear after seeing it myself. First of all Neeson scared the crap out of me the whole movie. He had crazy serial killer written all over him throughout the film. There are too many examples of this to explain. Also, Anna's breath fogged up a mirror, and to be dead, she did a lot of breaking things and talking. I'll admit that there were some things that made me think she was dead, but Neeson was just too scary not to be a serial killer. I think that the film would have been better if they had made the audience think Neeson was a serial killer, but in the end reveal that Anna really was dead. That would have been a nice twist. But no.. The premise was enough to make me want to see it regardless of any bad review I read, and I thought it was a good film that defiantly has a uniquely scary element and overall mood to it. The acting was amazing, but the directing was lacking. I think that if M Night Shyamalan had directed, this movie would have been a blockbuster. I look at it like a recipe. You have all the ingredients you need, and they are all great quality, but someone just didn't put them together quite right.",After.Life
150,anadeea_ag,Brilliant movie,9,30 August 2010,"Everyone is wondering if Eliot Deacon is a serial killer,a psychopath or if he is just a medium and he is helping people to cross over.And also everyone is asking if Anna Taylor is dead or not. In my opinion there shouldn't be such questions because the movie just presents an idea, the idea of being dead while living, having a dead soul and those ideas are covered by real terms, the movie presents a palpable situation, but the scenario it's just a symbol.Actually,if we analyze every single part of it we will find out that there are plenty of symbols.The beginning of the movie was not so impressive ,but I kept watching because I wanted to know which is the purpose of Eliot by doing all those things. But after a few more minutes ,I stopped wondering and I understood that I don't have to look forward for the ending, because the movie was more than I thought it was.Eliot represents the desire of human being to realize the importance of life.I think everyone should stop asking and start thinking at the real meaning of this wonderful movie.",After.Life

As Liam Nesson slowly convinces you to let your guard down, our suspension of disbelief is slowly dissolved by Wojtowicz-Voslov's stingy release of information: Is she really dead, is Liam's character a benevolent wise ferryman or up to some lesser gain? Just when I was lead to one resolve the story would change to the other, and this just pulled me in over my head, but that's why I watch horror movies. Unlike 'b' horror movies this one leaves you in peaceful state rather than scared to death, or laughing at its clumsy form. I thought the casting was perfect! Liam Neesan showed us a deeply creepy side we never knew he had, and FINALLY there is a director who was not afraid to let Christina's inner Gothic charm shine. The director's portrayal of a lonely ghost, or maybe not a ghost at all, gave her character unlimited dimension. I'll be watching this one again!!",After.Life

154,Griffinaz,Movie ending-Contains SPOILERS,5,19 March 2011,"To learn about the bulk of the movie read the other reviews. I only wish to comment on the ending and how I feel this movie could have gone from mediocre to decent. As mentioned in the other reviews, Anna Taylor ""dies"" in a car accident and wakes in the funeral parlor where most of the movie takes place. Through the rest of the movie the audience is guessing back and forth on whether or not she truly is deceased. In the end we are lead to believe that she is in fact quite alive. The movie had a very good ending point at the funeral with the dirt being tossed on the coffin as she awakens from her drug induced sleep and screams. The movie could have ended there with just a few additional scenes. The one where the child Jack is burying the live bird and makes a statement about it being better this way, as this indicates that he has accepted the mortician as his mentor and has started down the road as the apprentice to continue the grim works, and then finalize the movie with the scene of the mortician admiring his trophy wall as the camera backs away showing the sheer volume of images pinned to the wall, then fade to black. The additional scenes with the drinking, driving and Fiancé being killed was not important to the main plot of the movie and the additional scenes involving his accident and later demise confused the ending creating a lot of the confusion everyone is commenting about.I did not see this film as intending to explain life after death or any of the additional comments of that nature. I saw it as a decent suspense thriller with a disturbing demise for the numerous victims. To make up for the time cut by removing the fiancée final scenes they should have added some character building scenes at the beginning so then audience gained an emotional connection with the Anna Taylor character making her demise that much more intense.",After.Life
155,mtdallaire,I'm on the fence with this movie,7,11 July 2011,"I'm on the fence with this movie. Is she dead? Is she alive? She can smash things, she is locked, she is hallucinating and the funeral director is convincing, she also never feel even after 3 days, the need to drink nor go to the bathroom (I mean, your body would force you to do so).... So you think, well, maybe she is dead, and the funeral director really has a gift (curse)... but then, the fog of the glass, the drugs, the phone call... it's just weird, now you think, she is alive. At the end, I don't know if the girl trying to break out from the casket is just in her boyfriend imagination or she really is doing it?!?! Clearly, he didn't want a chat with the guy at the end, because he used a special tool to finish him... There is also a possibility of a complete other option, the dead peoples are really dead and the funeral director is really sick in his head (with schizophrenia and psycho) and imagining all the characters to be real when in fact they really are not. This would make the entire movie relevant...?! The chats, the drugs and the fact that the other people don't see anything wrong about the situation, cops, family, etc...The little boy doesn't make sense in that story. The character could have been removed and it wouldn't change the story in anyway.This movie is a thinker and it sucks that I will never know the real answers or the intent! Good job!",After.Life
156,deegeebee,Not Your Average Supernatural Thriller,7,16 June 2011,"The story line of this movie could have been a little clearer. There are too many things to think about in order to put the pieces together.It's disturbing to me that I gave this type of movie as much thought as I did. Maybe there is a little bit of 'Jack' in me too.Critics review this movie as a supernatural thriller. People die and think they are still alive. While in the process of letting go of the physical, there is a friendly mortician who helps them cross over.I think this is not a supernatural story at all but could really happen. That fact makes it even scarier.Here is my take on the movie.Eliot Deacon (Liam Neeson) is a serial killer. He causes the simulated untimely 'death' of his victims. They are brought to his funeral home where he toys with them for several days before finally burying them alive.Like most serial killers he keeps mementos of each victim in a brown paper bag that has their picture attached to the outside.Deacon is a mortician who does 'normal' funerals but also drums up new business fulfilling his need to dominate and kill his victims.Dead people are photographed with their eyes closed and the ones who he will bury alive are photographed with their eyes open.The old lady has her eyes closed in her picture. The young guy, (Anthony who was 'always confused') is one of Deacon's victims. His eyes are open in the picture.In Anna Taylor's (Christina Ricci) case, he uses his white pick-up van to harass her on the road eventually causing an accident. Being first on the scene, he administers a drug that simulates death. Later, armed with an official death certificate, he convinces her that she is, in fact, dead.Her warm breath appears on the mirror upstairs in the funeral home only to be quickly wiped off by Deacon. It appears again while she is lying in the casket before the final viewing and it is here that Anna realizes she is still alive. Also, the scar on her forehead looks pretty good at this time. The stitches covered up pretty well with makeup after partially healing.He gives her a nice funeral (at mom's expense) and buries her alive.Possibly a side effect of the drug is no hunger and that's why she never eats. Another side effect might be susceptibility to suggestion - don't know but it seems plausible after being constantly drugged. It obviously causes weird nightmares.Eliot does refer to 'cleaning up (bodily functions)' a couple of times. That would be easy to do with a water hose and slab having a drain at the foot. He may also help his victims along with their bodily functions while unconscious on the slab (catheter, enema etc.).Anna spends a lot of time walking around the preparation room unclothed. This leads me to believe that Deacon chose her for a 'special' reason. Who knows what else he did while she was unconscious? Paul Coleman (Justin Long) visits his detective friend Tom Peterson (Josh Charles) telling him that he thinks Anna is still alive. Peterson writes it off as grief but another officer knows of this drug (Hydroniam Bromide) that can simulate death. We later see it is the same drug used by Deacon and kept in a box in his desk drawer.At the funeral of Anna's piano teacher he opens his mouth showing it was not sewn closed like the cop's brother. It also shows he is still alive. Thinking back to the beginning where he is shown lying in the casket, there is a hypodermic needle and infamous brown bottle on the table next to him. He obviously told Eliot earlier that he likes white roses and 'they seemed appropriate somehow' when his widow asks Deacon how he knew. Same thing when the Beatrice Taylor (Celia Weston) asks about her daughter's violets. ('They seemed appropriate.') Jack (Chandler Canterbury) has no friends and is bullied by the big kids at school. His mother is a total looser who is hypnotized by TV game shows. But the really creepy part is how he likes to hang around the funeral home. (That's so much better than playing baseball!) Even when out riding his bike, he ends up at the funeral home. One time he sees Anna, his teacher, through the upstairs window of the funeral home.Jack has the quirk of crushing flower petals between his fingers and smelling them just like Deacon. The baby chick is moving and still alive when Jack closes the box and sprinkles dirt on it essentially burying it alive. Jack's entire life is training him to become Deacon's apprentice.Introverted, bullied, and lack of attention from his mother have a lot to do with Deacon becoming Jack's 'father figure'.Eliot and Jack follow Paul in the same white pick-up van knowing they can cause an accident like Anna's. Getting there first, they administer the Hydronium Bromide.Back at the funeral home, even armed with an official death certificate, Eliot knows he could never convince Paul he is dead.To keep his secret, Deacon is left no alternative but to embalm Paul alive.",After.Life
157,alan-oursland,Poorly written story,2,19 June 2011,"I like stories that have a consistent ground truth behind them. Movies that end intentionally ambiguously (such as Total Recall or Inception) annoy me. This movie is worse. It seems to have a ground truth but presents a world that violates that truth.I've read on the forums here that the director's commentary claims that Anna was alive and that the funeral director killed her.This may have been the director's (or the writer's) intent, but there are also story elements that indicate something else is going on. We see dream and hallucination sequences that seem to contain information the dreamer wouldn't know. There is a bobble-head doll that turns to face Paul as he walks around the room.The idea that a living Anna wouldn't fight more completely breaks my suspension of disbelief. She doesn't seem to eat for days (or have other bodily functions).In the end, this is just a movie. The director's intent in telling a story does not make it fact. There is no ground truth in reality and not even a decent facsimile in fiction. The film was shot, edited and acted very well, but no level of production quality can make up for a poorly written story.If you would like a visceral thriller built around the theme of an idea, you will probably enjoy this.

159,cumpane,Strong themes of misogyny and male violence,7,28 December 2012,"While I concur with other reviewers that there are a variety of ""problems"" with this movie, I find the tendency to see this film superficially to be a severe handicap to apprehending its true message.Liam Neeson's Deacon character represents old masculinity: repressive, envious, suspicious of women generally. ""Apple Guy"" represents the new man...he seeks what old masculinity never concerned itself with: the inner woman. More than a mannequin that cooks, Woman is to the new man an undiscovered country full of promise, adventure and ultimately, liberation for himself as much as for her.Deacon's interaction with the ""dead"" woman and the language used, which is dismissive and pacifying, reveals a general misanthropy. The interaction itself, though, points to a particular misogyny in confrontation of a woman in his power who cannot escape and who cannot fight back.The new man believes he knows something and Deacon is aware of this. His envy eventually leads him to kill the new man; crucifying him for taking the wrong side (the ""dead"" woman's). He succeeds, as he kills the hope inherent in new man's quest, throwing it on the pyre of old masculinity's Even, self-loathing and fear of Woman and any who invest Her with full humanity, as the new man does.The little boy is indoctrinated into Deacon's world of hatred and so the traditions of old masculinity live on.I can't believe there has been no feminist critique of this film.

Great performance by Liam Neeson, he's got a chilling laid-back malevolence that's more scary than if he was ranting and frothing at the mouth. Spooked the bejesus out of me. Ricci was OK. Long replaying his clueless boyfriend role.Hopefully the director won't get seduced by Hollywood and go onto to churn out overblown garbage.

You're never sure whether she's dead or alive, and by the end of the movie you're left guessing. There's obvious clues, and you only have to look at the message board to see how much debate there still is going on despite the movie being over 3 years old.

163,furtherintime,"A confused, clumsy piece of pretentious melodrama.",3,12 August 2010,"Ah, here we see yet another self-assuming, clunky mess of a film. We should have known, having seen the pretentious dot that has been placed between the two words of the title for no apparent reason.The opening is somewhat promising, involving a bored and depressed Christina Ricci, who gets involved in a budget-effective car crash and wakes up in a funeral parlour with the grim Liam Neeson looming over her, explaining that she is in fact, dead. That he tells her her blood flow has stopped before promptly injecting her with drugs (a rather pointless endeavour for someone with no circulation) denies the essence of her film-long confusion. But that doesn't seem to bother anyone at this point, because we like to give movies the benefit of the doubt, don't we. Unfortunately, Ricci's sole demonstrable skill in the film appears to be going from squeaky desperation to grim, monotonous acceptance and back again in a matter of minutes. This simply serves to add more confusion to the already bizarre plot, and ultimately makes us unsympathetic during the final scenes.The problem with the film is that it has no idea what it is. The director has clearly been hoping for a cut above the average horror flick, but there is not enough originality or wisdom to transform it into anything else. The result is a cheap and excessively melodramatic B-side horror, which lacks the spooky scares that make its tawdry counterparts so much more exciting. The fact that the film takes itself so very seriously throughout makes it all the more infuriating.One of the film's very few silver linings is Liam Neeson's understated performance as the unhinged funeral director, convincingly dishing out a mix of soothing sobriety and chilling psychosis, and managing to drag some life out of the clumsy and repetitive script. But then, you'd expect that from a man so undeniably bad-ass that he's even played an actual lion in a film.A diluted and overlong episode of The Twilight Zone, for horror completists and fans of Ricci's feminine form only.POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOWI find the ending worth a mention. Downer endings are all well and good in the right context. When the film's content is strong, and there is method and moral to the disappointment, one can still come away from it feeling rewarded, or at least provoked into contemplation.Unfortunately, none of this is applicable to After.Life. The film's plot relies on the prospect of a recovery and reconciliation between its two leads; the character development is too thin and plot points too few and far between to allow for anything else. So, after having sat through an hour and a half of dreary nothingness, we as a now solidly popcorn-eating audience expect the alleviation of some form of resolve, to reward us for enduring the rest of the film and to tick one final box in the series of clichés that it has been following so avidly throughout. But unfortunately, the film seems to think that a negative finale is a one-way ticket to critical acclaim. And once upon a time, it was, but now this is simply not enough. And so, we are left with an uninspired and underwhelming descent into rigor mortis, with the bad guy living to strike again, and again, and again. God forbid.",After.Life

The writers of the film wrote it in two different perspectives.The film was written as if she was dead and at the same time as if she was alive. If two people were to argue over if she was dead or alive during the film they both would be completely right!The film follows a young lady who is depressed and is not appreciative of her life. She gets into an accident and is sent to a mortician who has the gift of speaking to the dead.The question that still lingers is whether or not he buried her alive or was she truly dead to begin with.I had to rematch the film two more times after the first watch and i was still unable to determine if she was dead or alive due to the brilliant writing of the film.,After.Life

When she wakes up, she is in a funeral home, where the director tells her that she is dead and in transition to the afterlife. She tells him that there must be a mistake because she is awake and talking to him, to which he explains that he has a gift to communicate with the deceased. 
I enjoyed the premise of this movie, but there were some flaws. The movie lacked backbone, in which it had very little to support the overall theme of the flim. 
In the first place, there were a lot of things that were irrelevant/unnecessary to the plot that didn't really make sense anyways. ie the lights in the school in the beginning, the bobblehead etc. If I look at it logically, if I woke up in a funeral home and someone told me I was dead, obviously I would think they're insane. No one would be able to convince me that I was dead at all, especially given that I could manipulate objects, move around, make noise or see my own reflection. As soon as Liam Neeson opened the door to let me leave, I would leave, regardless of any vision or dream I have. Also when she managed to get the front door open and saw him pulling in out front, i would just run to the back of the building and break a window and get out that way. 
I think the film aims to be ambiguous without really achieving such, given that it's quite obvious she is alive. He was injecting her with the hydrogen bromide the entire time to keep her still, she could stand up, throw things, see her reflection. Her breath was present on the mirror, which he quickly wiped away before she could see, and when she saw her breath in the casket, she panicked and therefore he felt it necessary to drug her more. Also the uneasy looks across Liam Neeson's face all throughout the film, as when the police arrive. And what normal, non-psychopathic person would tell the fiance to go dig her up just after her funeral, especially if she had really been dead. The white van chased her on the highway and caused the crash, because he believed she wasn't worthy of being alive. He must have given her the hydrogen bromide before the paramedics arrived to slow her heart rate, so the coroner could pronounce her dead. Same deal with her boyfriend. And he flat out tells the kid that he's doing this, ""I'm the only one who can see the corpses walking around stealing oxygen from people who actually want to be alive, I have to bury them all"". The kid saw the teacher in the window, so the director tells him he has this gift, and offers to teach him so that the kid can one day continue his psychotic work. And the scratching on the casket after she's buried, like come on. Maybe i'm missing something, or I'm not thinking outside the box, but you can't tell me she's dead.

169,Orongo,Why so illogical?,2,5 August 2010,"In short: this movie is a waste of time.First of all, I think the cast was not chosen wisely. I know that Liam Neeson is a great actor, but for some reason he fails in performing the ""dark part"" of the undertaker, which is the most important character in this movie (in my opinion). While being excellent as the ""normal"" undertaker when interacting with relatives of the deceased, he is not able to express the feelings of his dark part. He is shouting to his dead ""clients"" in order to show how bad he is, but you still don't believe that he is convinced of what he is doing. It just looks like acting and this gives you a bad feeling when watching the movie. Christina Ricci is performing excellent (yes she looks great, and there are some nude scenes), but this doesn't save the movie. Justin Long is neither excellent nor bad. Who cares... his part is not that important for the movie.However, the cast is not the main problem, because the story is illogical as it can be. The director took it too easy with going into both directions and ignored the resulting contradictions during the final. I'm afraid, that after all the hints in the movie that were pointing in both directions, there was no room for a logical ending without removing the scenes that do not fit. The illogical story makes this movie a complete waste of time, because there is no other interesting point in this movie but to find out, what is really happening and why the hints are going in both directions.However in the end the director just throws away half of the hints and delivers an easy solution - too easy for serious storytelling.",After.Life
170,mags_04,Thoughtful and Creepy,10,9 November 2009,"What does it mean to be alive? Not a question you're going to find broached in 10,000 B.C. or 2012. But it is a question first time director Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo tackles in After.Life with surprising depth and skill. Christina Ricci plays Anna, a woman disconnected from her almost fiancé (Justin Long) and alienated by her mother, who moves about her days in a mostly apathetic haze. For the most part Anna's life seems, well, rather lifeless - until she wakes up on mortician Liam Neeson's slab only to learn that she is in fact dead. What exactly that means is the mystery.My favorite way to see a movie is when I know next to nothing about it (so I won't spoil anything here!), and that's how I went into the AFI screening of After.Life last night. I knew the basic premise and a little about the story, but other than that - nada. Which I have to say is a great way to approach a thriller. The highlight for me was Liam Neeson (no real surprise there) who brings surprising warmth and complexity to what could have otherwise easily been a very two-dimensional character. The other standout was Chandler Canterbury as Jack, Anna's young student who has a little figuring out of his own to do. Their performances alone are worth the price of admission. The director's attention to detail, dream imagery, and color (most notably a scene where Neeson washes the dye from Ricci's hair as she lies stretched across an embalming table) reminded me of the stark, Gothic beauty of Six Feet Under and Dexter. That said, this film isn't cut and dry, doesn't tie everything up neatly at the end, and asks more questions than it answers. It's definitely not your typical American movie - something I consider a positive aspect. If you don't, then I'd suggest skipping this one an netflixing Twister.",After.Life
