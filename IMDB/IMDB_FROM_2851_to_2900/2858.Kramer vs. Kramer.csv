0,MartinHafer,Some terrific performances....,10,25 February 2013,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a terrific film and I am a bit torn about whether to give it a 9 or a 10. The film isn't perfect. The cooking breakfast scene, for example, is way overdone (no father is THAT inept). But, the film does pack a HUGE emotional wallop and it is bound to leave most viewers in tears--and not in a cloying and manipulative way. So, I'll err on the side of 10--especially since the film has some terrific performances.I won't review the film or what it's about, as there are already a ton of reviews and comments on IMDb about the film and the subject matter it brings up. Now this isn't to mean I don't love this aspect of the film--I adore how the film pushes for social change in regard to paternal custody. What I'd instead like to discuss is the acting. The film earned an Oscar for Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor) and Meryl Streep (Best Actress) and the boy (Justin Henry) earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Hoffman was great. He showed a wonderful range in his acting--much greater than usual for a guy in a film. As for Streep, every moment she was in the film she was excellent, though I was surprised she got the Oscar for Best Actress since she really wasn't in the film that much. But, the one that REALLY impressed me was Henry--who just blew me away with his natural acting and emotionality. The kid was simply amazing and so real--it's a shame the Academy really won't give the Oscar to kids (though they sure will nominate them).Overall, a wonderful film but one you MUST watch with some Kleenex nearby. It sure packs an emotional wallop.",Kramer vs. Kramer
1,bkoganbing,The Love's No Longer There,10,24 March 2009,"Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by Justin Henry.What I really did like about Kramer vs. Kramer, it's greatest strength as a film is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature. Though the film is slanted in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's not presented as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. He's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when Streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while.Hoffman and Henry make do the best they can. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody.Both parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully, but in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother.Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the Supporting Actress category. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep does get less screen time than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film does focus on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. As for Meryl it's a Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screen.Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than channel Spencer Tracy in his performance.Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child. Don't miss it if ever broadcast.",Kramer vs. Kramer
2,SnoopyStyle,timely movie,8,25 February 2015,Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) is tired and leaves her family for California. Her husband Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is stunned and forced to take care of their son Billy. He had been working extra hard to get an important account. He blames it on her divorced friend Margaret Phelps (Jane Alexander) but later relies on her. His boss Jim O'Connor (George Coe) urges him to send the boy away to relatives. He brings home co-worker Phyllis Bernard (JoBeth Williams) in a hilarious scene.It's a heart-warming sensitive movie coming at just the right time in the culture. Hoffman is able to portray the man with just enough selfishness without being cruel. He is then able to transition to a more sensitive father. The kid does an impressive job for a kid. It is left a little up in the air why Joanna leaves which is fine by me. I'm glad that it's not something overly dramatic. It's also important that nobody is the clearcut bad guy. It allows the movie to not go too dark. Meryl Streep does a fascinating performance as the mercurial Joanna. It was a big winner on Oscar night although 'Apocalypse Now' is my favorite of that year.,Kramer vs. Kramer
3,Hitchcoc,The Rawness of Divorce,9,22 December 2016,"As is usually the case, there are no winners in divorce. Usually, there is no fault as people who are driven often make choices that send the other reeling. Dustin Hoffmann is a high powered executive. He is married to Meryl Streep, but even more, he is married to his work and its schedule. Streep runs off, leaving Hoffmann with their son. The majority of the movie involves the boding between the two men which is extremely bumpy at first. Hoffmann really has no clue how to raise a son he barely knows. The little boy longs to be with his mother, his primary parent in his life. But time helps heal. And then Mom comes back. What happens now? This is such a realistic portrayal of the pain of divorce and how it affects the defenseless. One of the best movies of the year.",Kramer vs. Kramer
4,mark.waltz,"Father becomes mother, but it won't be easy.",9,12 January 2015,"Meryl Streep's Joanna is a woman past the stage of a nervous breakdown. She's had it, she's tired of just being a wife and a mother, and even just having the supposed easy life of staying home and keeping house for busy artist Dustin Hoffman has sent her into a frenzy of emotions she can't rise above. Yes, she loves her young son (Justin Henry), but that isn't enough. She gave up her career at her husband's request and according to her, thus a piece of herself. When Ted (Hoffman) comes home from a hard day's work, he's still consumed by the events of the day, and can't even hear Streep tell him that she's leaving. Oh, by the way, she adds as the elevator door closes, ""I'm not in love with you anymore"". So with that, an eight year marriage ends (no mention is made of how long they were together prior to getting married), and a new relationship begins for papa Ted that he didn't have before: one with his young son Billy.Ted must now learn how to get his kid ready for school, and that means making breakfast, dressing him, and finding his way there before he heads off to the cut throat world of his Manhattan job. Being late for important meetings isn't going to win him any prizes, but overnight, he must stop thinking of just his career and start thinking of what is best for his motherless son. Where is Streep all this time? She turns up later a supposedly new woman and announces out of the blue that she wants custody even if father and son have bonded together to the point of being inseparable.This is a battle to the psychological death between the parents of the adorable Justin Henry, and even when he's being a brat (condemning the Salisbury steak Hoffman made for him and demanding chocolate chip ice cream instead), he's adorable. Father Hoffman can't deal with kid temper tantrums, telling the crying boy demanding his mommy, ""Well, I'm all you've got!"". But to tearful satisfaction of the audience, the two apologize to each other, and now, being motherless doesn't seem like such a bad thing. It's obvious whose side the audience is going to be on when this case goes to court.By this point in his career, Dustin Hoffman was always the best man at the Oscar's, never the groom, and even though he had fierce competition, it was very obvious that he was going to win for his very human betrayal of a man who changes because he has no other choice. There is great debate whether or not Meryl Streep deserved her first Oscar for this because her character of Joanna is a very contradictory character. She's minus the accents, too, of Streep's other Oscar winning characters, as well as minus sympathy as well because, mother or not, she did choose to abandon her son while ""finding herself"", and her sudden desire to disrupt his life certainly is very selfish. But selfish or not, she's all very human, and nobody would deny her access to Billy, just as long as Hoffman's Ted keeps him full time.Jane Alexander offers excellent support as their downstairs neighbor who indirectly gave Streep the courage to leave in the first place. Veteran actor Howard Duff is also very commanding as Hoffman's attorney, while JoBeth Williams has a very amusing cameo as one of Hoffman's dates who has a very embarrassing meeting with young Henry in the hall. (A TCM broadcast of this deleted the sequence since it contained brief nudity, disproving their ""uncut"" claim about the movies they show). The musical score is also very memorable, consisting of classical music re-arranged to sound almost new. New York City locales add to the charm of this movie. How can you not walk through central park and think of the few scenes which take place there from this movie? Winning Best Picture the same year over such formidable competition as ""Norma Rae"", ""All That Jazz"", ""Apolocalypse Now"" and ""Breaking Away"", this may not seem typical Academy material, but it certainly became very beloved all around. Justin Henry, too, took attention away from younger Ricky Schroeder who had been praised earlier in the year for the remake of ""The Champ"" but was pretty much forgotten by Oscar time. In reflection, while Schroeder's performance required a lot of tears and came from a film that had a mixed critical reaction, Henry's performance seemed almost effortless, as if he was living this character, from the moment he exhaustedly goes to the bathroom (realistically not flushing after being finished) to the scene where he sees his mother for the first time in over a year and runs into her waiting arms. Soap opera material for sure, but done realistically, this has emotional effect of some of the great theatrical dramas of the past fifty years.",Kramer vs. Kramer
5,gavin6942,A Film About Divorce That Was All-Too-Prescient,7,1 October 2012,"A just-divorced man (Dustin Hoffman) must learn to care for his son (Justin Henry) on his own, and then must fight in court to keep custody of him.Two things I wanted to talk about here: Dustin Hoffman's Oscar and JoBeth Williams' nudity. The Oscar is a bit of a mystery to me, and seems to be given to Hoffman for the film's content more than his actual performance. Now, I am not criticizing or insulting Hoffman -- he is a wonderful actor and is wonderful here. I just find it odd, after having seen ""Papillon"" and his other work of the era, that this is the film wherein he was awarded. It seems like his most impressive stuff was overlooked.Now, the nudity. It still amazes me to this day hat late 1970s and early 1980s movies could have nudity and still get a PG rating. It does not offend me (heck, show as much nudity as you want) but it does make me wonder why the MPAA became so lax in that time period...",Kramer vs. Kramer
6,lee_eisenberg,Oh really?,6,15 March 2020,"First let me say that Robert Benton's ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a good movie. It addresses important issues, namely the question of what makes one a good parent. Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, and the rest of the cast put in all their best efforts (not that I would expect less from them). The courtroom scene has all the tension that one would hope for in one of these movies. There's also a scene that could turn anyone off from parenthood.However, contrary to the Oscars, it was not 1979's best movie. This was hardly at the top in a year that gave us ""Norma Rae"", ""The China Syndrome"", ""Being There"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""All That Jazz"", ""Alien"", and the underrated ""1941"". Even as a movie that addressed important topics, KvK was more of a blink-and-you-missed-it movie. Everyone remembers the helicopters storming the village to the tune of Wagner's music in ""Apocalypse Now""; can anyone identify a famous scene from this movie?It's worth seeing, but don't expect it to change your life or give you a profound experience.It seems like we haven't heard from Dustin Hoffman since he got MeToo'd.",Kramer vs. Kramer
7,jboothmillard,Kramer vs. Kramer,9,6 April 2009,"I knew the two big stars of the film, I knew they both won their first Oscars, and I pretty much knew the concept of the film, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I definitely wasn't going to miss it. Basically Ted Kramer (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman) seems to have his work come before his relationship with wife Joanna (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) and eight-year-old son Billy (introducing Oscar and twice Golden Globe nominated Justin Henry). Joanna decides she can't take anymore, and leaves Ted to look after Billy on his own, which is obviously causing some strain between father and son. When Ted has learnt to adjust to his new responsibilities, and Billy seems to be coping, Joanna comes back and wants her son back. So Ted and Joanna go into court to fight for custody, Ted refuses to give Billy up, and unfortunately he loses, but in the end, Joanna realises her mistake, and that Ted is the better parent for Billy. Also starring Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jane Alexander as Margaret Phelps, Howard Duff as John Shaunessy, George Coe as Jim O'Connor, JoBeth Williams as Phyllis Bernard, Bill Moor as Gressen, Howland Chamberlain as Judge Atkins, Jack Ramage as Spencer and Jess Osuna as Ackerman. Hoffman is brilliant as the struggling father, and Streep does have her moments too. The best scenes of the film, besides the gripping court case, are when Hoffman tries to bond with his son, and the moments of stress between them, it is just a very convincing and truthful to its content. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Benton, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Streep was number 26, and Hoffman number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Kramer vs. Kramer

9,moonspinner55,"Very calculated and pressed out, but some of the manufactured heart is indeed moving...",8,21 March 2006,"The marriage of an upscale New York City couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out (""It took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door!"" a neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes on the ""motherly"" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. Highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit (with young Justin Henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), but the dynamics are intriguing and involving, and director Robert Benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness, marvelous classical music, canny editing and surefire bits of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel a lot more for her than Benton probably wanted. It all has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent. The film never falters from its preconceived path, and very fine acting nearly saves it, but I'm not sure where Benton was steering the film in the final act, and the closing scene is awfully abrupt. *** from ****",Kramer vs. Kramer
10,edwagreen,Kramer vs. Kramer- Custody Battle Was Never So Good ****,10,2 January 2011,"The best picture winner of 1979 was an absolutely terrific picture.Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep turned in Oscar calibrated performances as best actor and supporting actress, respectively.As Joanna, Streep is a disillusioned wife expecting more of life. At a critical point in their married life, Streep walks out on Hoffman and the latter has to learn to play both parental roles to their young son Justin Henry.Henry does a remarkable job with perfect timing here. He really deserved the nomination for best supporting actor. However, he would lose to Melvyn Douglas in ""Being There."" As an understanding neighbor, Jane Alexander was nominated in the supporting category, but was no match to Ms. Streep.The custody battle is well contested in the film. Both parties give justification for this reasons of wanting control over their young son.",Kramer vs. Kramer
11,sunwarrior13,Divorce And Self-Actualization,10,25 September 2012,"Kramer vs. Kramer is a dramatic film adapted from the novel by Avery Corman.The film stars Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep together with Justin Henry and Jane Alexander.It tells the story of a married couple's divorce and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son.It was written and directed by Robert Benton.Manhattan housewife Joanna Kramer walks out on her workaholic ad man husband Ted.She leaves him their young son Billy in Ted's less than capable hands. Through trial and error, Ted learns how to take care of Billy, devoting more energy to his family than to his work.Finally he loses his high-powered job because of his new priorities. When Joanna returns with her own lucrative job and the intent to take custody of Billy, Ted finds employment that won't interfere with his paternal duties.Even though he proves that he can do it all, Joanna still wins in court.However, Joanna rethinks her desires when she finally grasps how close father and son have become.Addressing the male side of the self-actualization question, previously explored from the female perspective in movies as An Unmarried Woman, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,and The Turning Point,the film focuses on father's evolution from absent parent to ideal father especially when he learns to balance domestic and professional lives. Joanna's attempt to achieve the same, however, gets buried.Only Streep's sensitive performance prevents Joanna from seeming an unsympathetic housewife.Aside from her,Hoffman was also commendable.They both deserve the Oscar they received for this film.Finally,the realistic depiction of Ted's travails praiseworthy together with the issues concerning divorce and self-realization.This film manages to be a thought provoking movie about the issues mentioned and it resists the urge to take sides or give easy answers which makes it worthy as well as the Best Picture on the year it was released.",Kramer vs. Kramer

13,preppy-3,Wildly overrated,6,2 March 2005,A wife (Meryl Streep) walks out on her husband (Dustin Hoffman) and 8 year old son (Justin Henry) after about 9 years of marriage. He learns to cope with bringing up a son on his own and holding down a job. He's helped by a caring neighbor (Jane Alexander) in the same boat. But then his wife returns and she wants full custody of their son...Well-made with excellent acting by everybody. It deals with the subject of divorce and custody rights intelligently (although Hoffman's speech in the courtroom is a bit much). Still I didn't really like this film.For one thing it was WAY overrated in its original release--how this won all those Academy Awards is beyond me. It's also quiet--too quiet. I was getting bored a few times. It doesn't hammer its point at you but is way too subtle. I was never emotionally affected by this at all--I found the movie cold and distant. Also it goes out of its way to make Streep the villain. (Also Hoffman and Streep did NOT get along during the making of this film--it shows--especially during a restaurant scene) It also has an ending that seems awfully rushed and that I didn't buy for one second. Also this all could have been avoided if Hoffman just hired a nanny--God knows he makes enough money!The acting kept me watching but the movie itself is too slow and quiet. Also Jobeth Williams pops up briefly and does a surprisingly explicit nude scene (for a PG movie).I can't really recommend this. I give it a 6 and that's just for the performances.,Kramer vs. Kramer
14,zardoz-13,"Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep have made better, more absorbing movies",8,19 May 2009,"In director Robert Benton's ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" Dustin Hoffman plays advertising salesman Ted Kramer who suddenly finds himself offered a partnership in the ad agency if he can bring in one of the biggest accounts. Elated by his big break, Kramer rushes home, late as usual, to give his wife Joanne (Meryl Streep) the good news. But Joanne shatters Ted's joy. She declares that she must leave him, no longer loves him, and must go away to find herself before she goes crazy and commits suicide.Abandoned by his wife, Ted slowly goes to pieces. He finds himself doubling as father and mother to his seven-year old son Billy. Newcomer Justin Henry plays the role with great restraint and doesn't steal the movie simply because he is cute and little. At the same time, Billy cannot cope with the loss of his mother. Kramer realizes gradually what Joanne endured and despite his energy and chin-up efforts to wring success from disaster, his own world collapses. Ted's responsibilities at the office clash with his duties as a dad. Although his boss gave him the big break, he begins to have second thoughts.About this time, Joanne returns. She tells Ted that she has recovered after a sojourn in California when she went into analysis. She has a good-paying job now and wants her son back. Kramer explodes. Nobody but nobody will take Billy away from him. A court battle over custody erupts. Abruptly, Kramer loses his job and must find a new one in twenty-four hours if he is to give his lawyer (elegantly played by the worldly, cane-wielding Howard Duff) a fighting chance.Robert Benton wrote and directed ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" from Avery Corman's bestselling novel. Certainly a movie about two parents fighting over which gains custody of a child is not the kind of movie calculated to lure filmgoers in for an evening of lighthearted, escapist entertainment. Thrill-seekers will find nothing here that is remotely spectacular. Nobody gets shot, and cars don't careen down thoroughfares ramming each other. Indeed, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" qualifies as a movie about people, their emotions, and about what makes an adult a fit parent. Several interesting issues are raised. For example, why is it that a mother by virtue of her sex is presumed to be a better parent? When it was originally released, the domestic and legal woes of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" were anti-commercial during a film season dominated by competitive, big budget pictures struggling to overshadow each other. Considering this predicament, writer & director Benton and producer Stanley Jaffe were applauded for their courage.Benton's impressive screen credits as a scenarist include ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" ""The Late Show,"" and ""Superman."" In ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" Benton has shrewdly deployed his characters in a story that leaves the issue of who hurts whom hard. Moviegoers may initially side with Ted because Dustin Hoffman is so lovable. Further, Ted has to struggle with bringing up Billy, providing for him, and keeping him in smiles. True, Joanne accuses Ted of ignoring her as a wife and a person. But we only have her word. Actors like Hoffman and Robert Redford seldom play heels, perhaps because the public cannot accept them as unsavory. Consequently, their villainy parceled out in the dialogue but rarely depicted physically.Once Meryl Streep returns, especially while on trial, her genuine remorse for abandoning Billy and her desire to be a mother again, with her tremendous efforts to prove her worth as a mother, should win the sympathy of the most die-hard cynic. The best thing about ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is that Benton resists the tendency to make either star a hero or a villain. Although the Kramers are fighting each other, neither deliberately stoops to the dirty tactics of their lawyers. When Ted's attorney asks Joanne if she were a failure at the single most important relationship in her life, she hesitates. Clearly guilt-stricken, she looks at Ted who mouths a silent ""no"" for her. Later, when Joanne's lawyer attacks Ted because Billy almost lost an eye in a playground accident owing to Ted's apparent negligence, she assures Ted that she never thought her lawyer would make the event an issue in court. Benton should be applauded for not giving either parent a clear-cut case and making one more sympathetic than the other.Benton's tactics, however, backfire. Neither Kramer wants to hurt the other. They just want to have Billy. The court battle forces them to play dirty which neither want to do. This is where ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" falls apart. The noble actions of both Kramers, their desire not to drag Billy into the courtroom, seem just too good to be true. It's a fault that Benton can overcome. Ordinarily, parents battling over custody rarely reflect on what benefits the child. While ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" doesn't quite measure up to the lofty label of masterpiece that many critics apply to it, Benton's film contains several good moments and even some brilliant ones, too! ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" gets off to a shaky start. We are shattered by the abruptness of Joanne's departure as is poor Ted. Afterward, the action settles into stride, as Ted copes with the pains of bringing up Billy. As a director, Benton is in top form showing how Billy and Ted grow closer to each other and develop a lifestyle. In a cinema season that had little to offer in terms of genuinely humane drama, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" easily won kudos by default. Nevertheless, good as the film is, Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep have made better, more absorbing movies.",Kramer vs. Kramer
15,grantss,"Great, emotional movie",8,23 July 2015,"Great, emotional movie. A powerful exploration of the causes and effects of divorce, and the controversial subject of child custody. Maybe not entirely balanced in its examination - very little is seen of Mrs Kramer (Meryl Streep) - and the ending is a bit trite and Hollywoodish. Superb performances. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep deserved their Oscars. Good support from Jane Alexander and Justin Henry (who, at 8 years old, became the youngest ever Oscar nominee).However, didn't deserve the 1980 Best Picture or Best Director.

16,Boba_Fett1138,Hoffman vs. Streep.,9,29 June 2007,"Over the years ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" has grown out to be one of the widely best known dramas. And yes this is for a good reason. Every textbook drama element is present in the movie and it's a great example of how to make a good and honest genre movie, without ever cheating the viewers. With that I mean, without ever getting overly sappy or melodramatic, although the movie its drama gets predictable in parts. But isn't that the case in basically every drama-movie?""Kramer vs. Kramer"" above all is a real character movie. I mean, it's not like the story is that much special, or something that hasn't been done before in any other form or shape. It are really the actors that make the characters and emotions come alive. Without its stars this movie wouldn't had risen above the level of an average made for TV movie, if I'm being completely fair.The concept of the movie also really doesn't sounds too much interesting. A movie about a divorce? Come on! How special can that be. Why should you even ever watch a movie on this subject? Well, let me tell you that ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a very special movie that knows how to move you. I guess that the movie should be especially recognizable and all the more touching for people whose parents really went to a divorce and had a 'fight' over custody.The biggest strength of the movie is that it all feels very real. Not just the events but especially and foremost the characters and how they act and respond to certain situations. The movie and its drama feels so real because the characters also feel so real. So kudos to Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep (although her role is not as big as you would expect), who both won an Oscar for this movie but also to the young Justin Henry as the young son and Jane Alexander, who both received an Oscar nomination. So the movie was nominated in all acting categories, which should say enough about the acting power that's in this movie. Dustin Hoffman's character really transforms throughout the movie, when he tries to as good as a father as possible. It's really touching to see.The movie shows how hard parenthood is and foremost shows that there can't be such a thing as the 'perfect parent'. It also helps to give this movie a very honest and straight-forward feeling, like with so many '70's movie also was the case.A movie that's unique in its sort and is above most other genre-movies.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kramer vs. Kramer

With no backstory to go on, we are left with a few bits of info from her as she was leaving. The implication is that she's not happy and hasn't been happy for some time.Her sudden departure leaves Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) in a very untenable position. He has a small child that demands much attention and a professional career that demands almost as much attention. Joanna dropped off the scene for 15 months before waltzing back to New York demanding her son. And that's when we get Kramer vs. Kramer.It's an excellent movie dealing with an interesting dynamic. The most common narrative is the father that walks out on his family. Should a man like that ever want custody of his kids he'd assuredly lose that battle. But what about a mother that abandons her kids and wants custody? She is the mother after all and most people would agree that young children should be with her mother. Yet, this case isn't so cut and dried. You have a mother that's abandoned her child and a father who's been a model dad. Oh, what a quandary.Hoffman is superb, Streep is always a pro, and the story itself is very compelling. In the battle of Kramer vs. Kramer I pick Kramer.",Kramer vs. Kramer
18,evanston_dad,An Intelligent and Solid Film About Divorce,8,9 November 2007,"After a decade of turbulent unrest, American movies began to switch gears and turn their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social unease to the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it's one of the best. It gets a rather bum rap now, because it's known as the film that beat ""Apocalypse Now"" for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they're not remotely the same, but can't we enjoy them both? Director/writer Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie; its strength lies in its performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep particularly, playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody, and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating, and feels authentic. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero, or Streep's straying mom as a villain. They're neither good or bad as people -- they're simply bad at being married.The film is tear-jerky at the finale, but not in a manipulative way. It earns its right to elicit sobs.Grade: A",Kramer vs. Kramer
19,HotToastyRag,Still stands the test of time,8,30 April 2020,"It's just not possible to watch Kramer vs. Kramer with the same lenses that you would have worn in 1979. The movie stands the test of time very well, but divorce and custody battles are so commonplace, more modern children than not come from broken homes. This is still a heart-wrenching, inspiring drama of a man thrust into fatherhood and learning to love it, but it's not as novel as it was forty years ago. In fact, in the 2010 flick How Do You Know, a character's mother abandons her family because she watched the movie Kramer vs. Kramer.Dustin Hoffman starts the movie at the top of his game. He's got a high-paying job, gorgeous '70s hair, and a wife at home content to raise his son. When wifey, played by Meryl Streep, decides her life is incomplete and leaves him in search of self-fulfillment, his whole world gets turned upside down. He no longer has a wife to run errands, cook, clean, and spend every waking moment with their sun, Justin Henry. He loses his great job and can't get another one to accommodate his new schedule. He still has his hair, though.Meryl Streep won her first Academy Award for her performance in this movie, and as much as you'll absolutely hate her character, keep in mind that you're supposed to. A woman who leaves her family to find herself is not someone you're supposed to like, not if you've spent the past hour watching the husband struggle. She's supposed to make you want to scream and throw things at the television, and she does. It's a wonder she didn't get typecast as villains after making such a powerful impression in this early role.This movie is full of iconic moments, and everyone will have his own favorite scenes. In one, Dustin and Justin are shopping, and after taking his son's directions on what type of things to buy based on the color of the bottle Mommy used to buy, he asks, ""What color?"" when Justin reminds him to buy cereal. In another, he's enormously stressed and doesn't want to show his son that he's upset so he tries to make French toast... in a coffee cup. I love the tearjerker scene when Justin hurts himself on the jungle gym and Dustin insists on being in the room with him when the doctor sews him up. It's a subtle movie, but it's a tour-de-force for Dustin Hoffman, who gets to explore situations and feelings many men didn't get to delve into in 1970s films.",Kramer vs. Kramer
20,AaronCapenBanner,Moving Divorce & Custody Drama.,8,7 September 2013,"Dustin Hoffman delivers another excellent Academy Award performance as Ted Kramer, a husband and father who one day is stunned to learn that his wife Joanna(Meryl Streep) has left him to find herself, leaving Ted heartbroken but also with custody of their young boy(Justin Henry, quite good). Ted tries to raise his son, while dealing with his anger toward Joanna, and trying to juggle his career responsibilities, which take quite a toll on him, though he eventually comes to bond with his son closely, which is disrupted by the sudden reappearance of Joanna, who wants custody, and has a lawyer, though what the court decides may not be the final word...Powerful drama has superb performance from the cast, expert direction by Robert Benton, and a mature, thought provoking script.

21,Sylviastel,Joanna is a very unhappy woman and it took a lot of courage to walk out this door.,10,30 January 2007,"I saw Kramer v. Kramer on video and it still touches my soul. The original score is excellent. I love the fact that they filmed in New York City by showing the sights and sounds of New York in 1979. I thought Meryl Streep showed that she's a scene stealer in this film and deserved her academy award as well as Dustin Hoffman did for Best Actor. Jane Alexander is superb as the supportive divorcée and single mother Margaret. Justin Henry proved his acting abilities as a young ten year old in this special role. The direction of the film moves quite decently for this melodrama. Films about divorce have come and gone but this film is still a classic because it seems so genuine, real, and authentic. If you have a first rate cast, writing, and a great director, Robert Benton, the film is an American classic in the same sense as Ordinary People. It's still a movie that everybody can relate too.",Kramer vs. Kramer

I was in grade 5, and still a kid, and the drive closed down 4 years later, but the film still lingers in my memory.  An adult movie, which a kid finds entertaining.  That is a mark of excellence.  Hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors, and this film proves it.  I like the Billy put down the ice cream scene, and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself.  Remember Joe Flairty crying.  Please email me if you like the SCTV skit.  Not a bad film at all, it is a story about a father, and his son.

23,Mr-Fusion,High marks for its sensitive handling of a horrible situation,8,30 April 2015,"I've gotta say, in a movie that features Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep (both offering high-calibre stuff), it's Justin Henry that really leaves an indelible mark on ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". You conjure a certain idea when you hear what this movie's about (and that's true, those are some unpleasant divorce proceedings in the courtroom, to be sure), but there's a real emotional core to this that you just don't expect. It's not bad enough that Hoffman's been left to father his child alone, but Meryl Streep has to come back for custody. Where this movie really shines is in the scenes with Hoffman and his son (Henry), both in bonding and saying goodbye. It's a beautiful relationship. Streep gets the shaft because of this, but she's still not half-assing it.This is a brutal movie because of the pervading sense that the wound always feels fresh. And you never see the emotional hay-makers coming. But the sentiment isn't artificial, and there are no overwrought theatrics. That's what I love about this; there's genuine heart to all of it. And I defy anyone to keep from welling up during father and son's dialogue scene in the closing minutes (""You're not gonna kiss me good night anymore, are you, Dad?"").8/10",Kramer vs. Kramer

26,Smells_Like_Cheese,What a terrific acting movie,9,28 July 2005,"I consider myself lucky that I got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" was great to me because I think I could relate to it.Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst. Through this movie, actually, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had as just much pain as my sister and I had.Back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend this for a lot of people, because I think most can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy, and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors. It's a good movie and deserves more credit than a 7.5.9/10",Kramer vs. Kramer
27,blanbrn,Good movie that showcases the emotions of divorce and child custody. And uses the sexism theme well.,7,2 September 2007,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" in my opinion isn't a great movie, yet it is still a very good one and very watchable due to the performances of Hoffman and Streep. The issue that dominates the film child custody to me is outdone as this film to me has a stronger emotional theme of sexism, it clearly shows that a man can be just as emotional as a woman. Dustin Hoffman stars as Ted Kramer a hard working adman for a firm and he's married to Joanna(Meryl Streep) a pr magazine rep both are successful and typical New York City people. The big difference is Ted seems more at peace he just works himself to hard, while Joanna has insecurities and doesn't really know who she is yet. So one day Joanna leaves out and says it's over a shock and blow to Ted, because she's leaving their son Billy(Justin Henry) with him to raise as her discovery and search for inner self will be found in California. The scenes are fun and heart warming with Ted trying to cook french toast hey that's a woman's thing! Don't worry he learns how to make it before the films end! Slowly the bond of father and son relationship develops it becomes as close as the one Billy had with his mother really a switching of genders. And it's memorable the emotions and love that Ted gives Billy after he falls on the playground and gets stitched up it really shows a loving and caring compassion that fathers can have. Only the film then shifts to a drama when Joanna returns saying that she found herself on the west coast and she wants Billy back. So then with a tough custody battle, Ted is fired yet he's a fighter and finds a job that pays less, but yet he supports him and Billy thru the hard times. Ted may not have been the victor in court yet in Billy's heart he was as you the viewer see in the end Billy sees the real light and has grown to love and feel a bond with his father and that's who he wants to be with. A good film yet nothing great the two key elements that carry it are the Dustin Hoffman performance, Streep's was okay one of her early ones, but most of all the movie proved a man can feel compassion and love and raise a child and become just as attached as a mother even though many feel this is unfair sexism it's just a showing of good gender equality.",Kramer vs. Kramer

29,sddavis63,"Excellent, Heart-Wrenching Film",9,15 January 2003,"Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the very first time just a couple of days ago, and understood from the very beginning what all the fuss is about. This movie held my attention from beginning to end, and ran me through the whole range of emotions (and might have helped me discover a few I never knew about.)Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here.9/10",Kramer vs. Kramer
30,ElMaruecan82,"Kramer, Kramer and Kramer ...",10,24 October 2011,"To a certain extent, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a fitting title. Its merit is to define with a powerful clarity the conflict between Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep) Kramer who have less in common the last name, than a sincere a profound love for their son, Billy (Justin Henry), both the victim of their divorce and the hostage of their fight for custody.But after several viewings, I find something subtly (and maybe deliberately) misleading in the way the title reduces the story to the trial while it's only the conclusion of a long learning and understanding process, from both sides. Yes, it's easier to root for Ted, as he's the one left by Joanna and jeopardizes his career to take care of Billy and Joanna's screen time isn't enough to bring more insights about the emotional crisis that lead her to leave her son.But the film doesn't ask for a bias, it respects the intelligence of the viewer enough to understand that if the story focused on Joanna, and took time to show what kind of husband and father Ted used to be, she might have gotten more support. But Robert Benton's thought-provoking Oscar winning script, invites us to understand the side we're not standing for, in a quest for the truth, which is so complex it can't be one-sided. This is the most compelling power of courtroom dramas: to tell the truth, the whole truth, the only truth, yet it's so underused as most movie trials rely on an innocent vs. guilty basis, and the point is just to determine if the verdict will be fair.Joanna abandoned her home, renounced to her duty as a mother, in a sort of desperate existential impulse, then came back to ask for custody. Ted, while not the perfect father took care of Billy with what was at hands, and the whole film is about his learning of becoming a good parent. It's hard to believe this is not an open-and-shut case, but this is why I mentioned courtroom dramas with uncertain truths: take ""12 Angry Men"", it's never about getting certitude but more about getting closer to a more reasonable approach, deprived from any emotional or sentimental bias.The bias toward Ted is reinforced through something clearly mentally unstable in Joanna's behavior, yet Meryl Streep's extraordinary performance brings a three-dimensional aspect to a mother, from the very first frames, make it absolutely impossible to believe she doesn't love Billy, or she is not a good mother. strong enough to understand the threat her mental state would have caused for her kid. Ted questioned the courage of Joanna for such a 'selfish' act, but he deliberately denies her desperateness. She felt she wouldn't be a good mother as long as her mind would be polluted by her hostility against Ted. Objectively, we can consider Joanna's act as necessary but immature.But Ted isn't a model of maturity either and his relationship with Billy indirectly highlights what kind of man he was. And it takes more than fidelity, than a job, to be a good father. Ted's mistake was basically to take many things for granted and wasted the most precious time of his life, trying to earn it. The point is not to judge if he's right or wrong but he clearly appears like a workaholic incapable to dedicate a time for anything but his work. In the first confrontation with Joanna, he's so blinded by his promotion he can't hear her telling she's leaving. When he faces the sad reality, he denies his responsibilities.And the collateral damage of these immature attitudes is Billy, the heart of the story. The movie realistically depicts the struggle between a father and a kid to reconstruct a relationship, and Robert Benton's direction admirably depicts the evolution through three important stages: denial, anger and acceptance. Ted denies his part of responsibility, blames Margaret (Jane Alexander), the recently divorced friend who probably brainwashed Joanna with her feminist ideas and he even promises his boss that he wouldn't let this situation interfere with his job. Both Ted and Billy act as if it was a temporary situation.After the first letter confirming that Mommy will never be back (hence Ted's immediate decision to remove every trace of her presence), the anger can be perceptible as both understand they'll have to endure each other. And this state of anger escalates until the emotional highlight of the film, and its defining moment with the ""I hate you"" scene is the pinnacle of Ted's nightmare, and probably the only way he and Billy found to exorcise their fears and anguish, because after that, they understand that it's time to learn about living together. And Ted learns to become a part like Joanna used to be, a reality highlighted by his new friendship with Margaret.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is about two persons progressively understanding each other, after a reversal of roles. Joanna allows herself to be selfish, and enjoy a sort of freedom, to understand that this feeling would be worthless without the beautiful experience of motherhood. And Ted, for once, faced selfishness and learned about caring, about being patient, about struggling, in other words, becoming a good parent. Never patronizing, the movie depicts with an extraordinary realism, served by close to perfect performance, the documentary-like reality of divorce (three simple breakfast-making scenes illustrate the evolution of the father and son's cohabitation)""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is the coming-of-realization story of two persons; trying to improve themselves in the name of their love for Billy and in fact, the love between them. And as there's no love without recognition, empathy and sacrifice, the film conclude with two decisions from both Ted and Joanna, so generous, that whatever their flaws were, the two Kramers are finally redeemed.",Kramer vs. Kramer
31,MOscarbradley,"A good, strong American film that is still worth seeking out.",8,20 October 2019,"It may not be the masterpiece many people claimed of it when it first opened but ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is still one of the finest, grown-up American pictures of its decade. It could have been unbearably cute but writer/director Robert Benton, adapting Avery Corman's novel, approaches the subject with such a degree of honesty it is both unsentimental and very moving; he even manages to get a great performance from seven year old Justin Henry as the child caught in the middle of a bitter divorce, (he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor).Of course, at its heart is a magnificent performance from Dustin Hoffman as the single father, doing a remarkable job of raising his son when his wife, (relative newcomer Meryl Streep), walks out on him in order to 'find herself'. The plot involves Streep's attempt to gain custody of young Henry a year after leaving him. This was Meryl's first Oscar winning performance, (in the supporting actress category), but I find her work here highly mannered. Much better is Jane Alexander as a friend and neighbour who comes to Hoffman's rescue; hers is a lovely, natural performance, totally without affectation.A good deal of the film's strength lies in the little domestic details of Hoffman's relationship with his son and in the way Hoffman deals with the issues confronting him. Seldom has a Best Actor Oscar been more richly deserved. It's also a great New York picture; Nestor Almendros did the superb cinematography. Unfortunately Benton never lived up to the promise he showed here and in his earlier films, ""The Late Show"" and ""Bad Company"" and has done nothing comparable since. No masterpiece then but a good, strong American drama that is still well worth seeking out.",Kramer vs. Kramer
32,gbill-74877,A dissenting view,4,7 August 2021,"A couple of great actors and a film that was well-made, but it was irritating to me that its narrative was so dominated by the male point of view. Meryl Streep disappears for about half of the movie and we're told about her character's perspective, but it just doesn't compare to everything we see happening with Dustin Hoffman, whose character juggles a demanding job, single parenting, and dating, and comes out looking like a saint by the time the film's done. Both come to self-realizations of sorts and own up to their shortcomings I guess, but overall, I felt more bias than authenticity in the script. I disliked the weakness in Streep's character, felt the film was manipulative/melodramatic in pushing all those emotional buttons, and hated the ending.",Kramer vs. Kramer

34,lesleyharris30,"A Well Acted Film that withstands the Test of Time,",9,8 November 2015,"Kramer vs. Kramer is an outstanding movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast all around. It's a dramatic, and at times very surreal, film that deals with the subject of divorce in the most blunt way possible, showing how a couple can simply wake up one morning and realise they don't love each other anymore, and fight for the custody of their child, it's dramatic and it never cuts corners or tries to be sweet, it's just life. The plot is very slow moving at times, which is my only real issue, while it's nice to have a slow pace that mostly consists of dialogue, there comes a time when we want the plot to develop, there's a very long period where we don't see or hear from Meryl Streep's character, and are left feeling very anxious. The performances are magnificent and this type of film couldn't have been good without that, Dustin Hoffman, one of my favourite actors, shines in this role, he could definitely relate to Ted Kramer and played him very naturally, he bottles up his emotions, which is just as powerful as crying, his scenes with his on screen son Justin Henry are the highlight of the movie, there is a real love and bond there as Hoffman is forced to become a real father figure. Meryl Streep also shines in all her scenes, she's a miserable, emotional wreck and it can be seen in every moment she is on screen. A powerfully acted and surreal masterpiece, Kramer vs. Kramer still holds up today and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.

36,ironhorse_iv,"While, the movie is call Kramer vs. Kramer and a Kramer will win, in the end. In my opinion, we all win, because this movie is great.",8,20 January 2015,"Kramer vs Kramer is one of the most realistic depiction of a family being torn apart by divorce and one of the first, on film. Adapted from the novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the movie tells the story of a married couple's divorce, Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son, Billy Kramer (Justin Henry). Directed by Robert Benton, the movie reflected a cultural shift which occurred during the 1970s, when ideas about parenthood were changing. The movie serves as Hollywood's answer to many contemporary questions toward divorce. This movie forever put a great understanding about how hard it is to be divorce and raising a child. The movie is made out to be a divorce drama, but you barely get that until ¾ in the film. It's more about Hoffman's character, learning how to become a better father than an actual showdown between the two parents. This is one of the first film that portray a father in a more sensitivity type role. The father in the film takes more of an attachment style of parenting, when Joanna choose to live outside, the traditional role of being confined to some extent to an ideal mother and wife. You really enjoy the film for each scene in the movie, where Ted Kramer grows closer and closer to his son and takes his duties as his father, very serious. One of the most famous scene in the movie is the 'ice cream' scene that gets me every time. Dustin Hoffman really knew his role, and how rough divorce could be, because at the time of filming, he was going through a real life marriage separate with his first wife. Indeed, Dustin Hoffman deserve the Academy Award, Best Actor win for this film. The same goes to Meryl Streep for the supporting role. Joanna is not an easily appealing character, but Meryl Streep makes her likable. Meryl Streep at the time, was still recovering from the death of her lover, actor John Cazale from lung cancer. It's sad, that Meryl Streep is barely in the film. The scene with Meryl Streep in the courtroom was her Oscar breaking moment. No matter, how good, Ted Kramer can serve the mother role, in the end, it's hard for the child to break their maternal bond. Still, the ""tender years"" doctrine that states mothers are better parents than fathers of young children was on the wane by the late 1970s, when the film came out, thus it's unlikely a judge would still make that the sole basis of his decision. I'm really glad, that the movie gave equal weight to both parents, showing their strengths and faults. There wasn't a lot of mean-spirit arguments or fighting between them. I'm kinda glad, because it would had turn me off, from enjoying the film. It's very importance to show both Joanna and Ted's points of view, rather than one. If, they only did one, it would be, very off-putting. The movie even made me, like Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. He deserve his nomination. Unlike, many other child actors, at the time, he wasn't annoying or seem inexperienced in his acting chops. He played the role in a very maturely for a child, his young age. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff, and George Coe. The movie also make great use of classical music like Vivaldi's Concerto in C major for mandolin and strings and Henry Purcell's work. It appears over the opening credits and throughout the film. It was a joy to listen to. Made in 1979, the movie is a little dated. The story lacks substance compare to today's soap-operas. Its rating is bit questionable. The movie is rated PG, but the movie has some foul language, drug use and nudity that puzzling to see in a PG film. I guess, 1979 was a little more open, than parents of this generation. It's more PG-13, these days. It really up to the parent if they really want to show this movie to their children. I do think, children do need to understand what divorce is all about and this movie still is one of the best films that cover that issue. It has a positive message that encourages sensitivity, understanding, responsibility, and tenderness in child-parent relationships. The film gives good examples of positive ways of dealing with anger, fear and disappointment. No wonder, why this film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1980. Overall: It's a very thoughtful film. I'm glad, that I watch it. I believe kids and parents who've been through divorce will find much that is relatable and if a movie can help people dealt with it. Then I think it's a good movie. I recommended it.",Kramer vs. Kramer

The film does a good job of conveying the pain of divorce, although it tends to pull a bit too much at the heartstrings at times. Hoffman is terrific as a man who is so immersed in his job that he unwittingly neglects his family and pays the price. Streep does a good job in the difficult role of an unsympathetic character, a part she parlayed into stardom. The always reliable Alexander turns in another fine performance as a supportive friend.

38,sol-,Versus,7,20 April 2017,"Forced to take care of his young son when his wife walks out on him, a workaholic finds himself in a custody battle when his wife returns eighteen months later in this emotionally charged drama. Dustin Hoffman is excellent in the lead role with many remarkable moments throughout, mostly notably the way he slowly comes apart while making breakfast for his son for the first time. The film is shot with a number of superb subtle touches too, such as the camera every so slowly zooming in on Hoffman in the scene where he is fired. While many of the themes here are nothing new (juggling family and work; single parenting), the quality of acting from all concerned elevates the material. The best aspect of the film is probably how we are given a chance to hear the mother/wife's side of the story in the second half of the movie. While the movie is nowhere near as two-sided as it could have been, there is something touching in how the mother/wife is never turned into a villain - especially since her request to have her son back initially seems plain selfish. Meryl Streep is very good in the part too, turning what could have easily been a detestable character into a relatable human being. The conclusion here might not be particularly realistic, but with a sensational closing shot and memorable final dialogue exchange between the two leads, it is hard to resent the choice of ending.",Kramer vs. Kramer
39,johnnyboyz,"Brilliantly directed, acted, shot and written  a genius piece of character study.",8,26 June 2007,"In what some call one of the most perplexing decisions made by the Academy when Kramer vs. Kramer was awarded the 1979 best picture Oscar over Apocalypse Now, after viewing the said film; I can say that for whatever reasons they had, they had them on good grounds. The reason I can't say if they're right or not is because I haven't seen Apocalypse Now.Kramer vs. Kramer is a character study  it's a raw character study of two people called Ted Kramer (A then 42 year old Dustin Hoffman) and Billy Kramer (A then 8 year old Justin Henry) who are living together because Joanna Kramer (A then 30 year old Meryl Streep) walked out on them. What's good is that this happens really early on in the film so there's no need for build up towards Joanna and we don't immediately know the reasons for her walk out which means that after five minutes of her and an hour and half of the other two; who do you think the audience are going to make the link with and, ultimately, root for.To say that this film merely centres around two people living in a New York apartment is too-a premature statement. The film slowly builds up, biding its time and brilliantly placing its scenes of a different nature as the fist hour to an hour and a half goes by. The way in which Ted Kramer tries to balance his work and the time he spends with Billy proves to us how busy he really was when there were three in the household. Also, the way in which things get more and more desperate as the film wares on is heart and gut wrenching. Sorry if this does sound like a spoiler but Ted's attempts to merely 'blag' his life as he sits on top of a brilliant portfolio and a big promotion business-wise yet home comes-a-calling whenever things look good is simple yet truly gripping film-making. Not only this but we start off with a simple thing like making breakfast and his attempts to do that right  just the way Billy likes it; it doesn't go a hundred per cent correct but it'll do. However, on the scale of things that was just one breakfast the morning after Joanne left, now think of the bigger more important things.What's also clever about Kramer vs. Kramer are the little things that perhaps go unnoticed. The fact that Joanne is made to look like the antagonist yet barely features for the first third. When she does eventually turn up, the film is turned on its head and the routine we've got used to suddenly flips over and goes down a different route. This just places the audience more and more in Ted's shoes and it's fantastic when you think about it. Also, the fact that one of my favourite sequences involves a long tracking shot early in the morning as Billy walks into the kitchen, notices Ted reading a newspaper, sits down and as the camera reaches its destination; it pauses  expecting something to be said but nothing happens and we cut away to the next scene  fantastic stuff.With Ted's desperation getting more and more intense as his job and life begin to crumble around him as well as Joanne's re-emergence from the woodwork and her demands  it can be looked at as tragic yet entertaining, wholly depending on whether you've been through a divorce or not only this will only further place you in the shoes of Ted.Kramer vs. Kramer is a well directed, well acted and well shot film that plays with film conventions and successfully plays with the audience as well  definitely recommended if you're after something smart.",Kramer vs. Kramer
40,filipemanuelneto,"Excellent, at all levels.",10,12 September 2020,"There are no easy weddings. Whoever is married, let him say it for you! And there are no easy divorces. There are always moments of accusations, acid exchanges, traumatic legal struggles, and children are often the most affected. This incredible film is about that.Ted and Joanna Kramer were just another couple in an agonizing crisis: with work increasingly demanding, Ted was no longer able to pay attention to his wife's emotional needs, and the emotional divide between them became insurmountable. She packs her bags, walks out the door. He leaves everything behind, including his own son. Ted will have to change his life and learn to be a mother and father, knowing in advance that he will not get the same time and reasoning available to work at 110% as he did before. And the ghost of a legal battle for the custody of the child will always be a sword of Damocles on him.The film is really good, it approaches the problem with a rare elegance and we can actually follow the changes in the routine and in the behavior of that father and that son, as they adapt. The script was wonderfully constructed and the emotional bond that we are establishing with the characters is fast and solid. At times, I felt that the film sided with the father on many issues, and that the maternal figure was almost condemned by the end of the marriage. On the other hand, the film raises very serious and pertinent questions as to how the courts, often relatively informally, tend to favor the mother's side in custody disputes. I think the way in which Ted Kramer exposes himself in the scene where he is asked about it in court is a real libel for defending a father's ability to be considered as good as any mother to raise her child. It's a joke, thirty, almost forty years after the film was made, and men are still a long way from earning the right to better prospects in a legal dispute over a child.The actors did an excellent job. The film has a relatively small cast, and everything revolves around the family in disintegration. Dustin Hoffman is an excellent protagonist and really deserves to be acclaimed for his interpretation which, moreover. Beside her, equally grandiose, Meryl Streep manages to save her character who, in the hands of an actress without her talent and ability, would become a simple villain empty of content ... the only thing that may have hindered her is to have really little time in the film. Justin Henry, who gave life to the couple's young son, also knew how to work very seriously in his role and the way he did it was truly worthwhile, considering his age. Finally, a word of appreciation and praise for the work of Jane Alexander, in the role of the neighbor and best friend of the couple.Not being the type of film where technical details stand out, it maintained a regularity that accentuated its elegance. Cinematography contributed decisively to this by using colors and light well, and maintaining a generally neutral contrast (in some scenes this was purposely altered). The sets and costumes are also very good, and I personally would like to highlight the way the decoration of the house changes over time: the maternal figure disappears, the ""feminine touch"" too, things become more practical. Finally, a note of praise that seems fair and important to the soundtrack, built on a solid foundation of melodies by Vivaldi and Purcell, two giants of Baroque music. As a confessed and incorrigible music lover, I was delighted to appreciate this soundtrack.",Kramer vs. Kramer
41,leplatypus,And vs feminism too (tv),10,12 March 2015,"I liked late 70s movies as it was the years where i was a little kid. I opened my eyes to the world at this moment and coming back to this time is always emotional for me. This movie was all the more interesting for me that it deals with parenthood so this was also the life of my parents back then. For years i heard about it for its cast and divorce fight but now that i have watched it, i realize that it's rather a pro-man movie. Indeed, Streep doesn't lack anything or suffers however she left the home on a impulse and she is really depicted as bad ! Then, Dustin proves he can be as good as her for educating their son and managing his job. So it's really a surprise and a great moment to see a movie so oriented in one point of view. I'm sure today it would be impossible to shoot it as nobody would want to be so assertive ! The dynamic classic musical piece that opens the movie is really well chosen as the movie is just like that : fast paced, emotional. The kid is really excellent and there's a good chemistry between the two guys. I think that Dustin is a great father as he really understand his son and can be as much stern as caring. He gives also a amazing lesson when pushed to his limits, he never indulges into violence. I also really liked when he wants to cry but instead offers a big smile. So it's truly a classic and i would recommend it without hesitation to my future family !",Kramer vs. Kramer

The courtroom scene is good but it's not up to the level of the rest of the movie. ""Kramer vs Kramer"" also has one of the biggest cop-out endings of all time. The ""happy"" ending is unrealistic. It feels like an add-on after test screening reactions. The filmmakers were more concerned with the audience leaving happy than they were with being real. The ending doesn't ruin the movie. It just never would have happened. The only other demerit, and it's also not a deal breaker, is Meryl Streep. I've become more and more tired of Meryl Streep and her ""acting"" over the years.

43,SAMTHEBESTEST,A heart touching drama on divorce and parenthood that could have got more emotional and intellectual if wanted.,7,12 April 2020,"Short Review :-
Watched Kramer Vs Kramer (1979)A heart touching drama on divorce and parenthood that could have got more emotional and intellectual if wanted. See, divorce and parenting a child have not been new subjects in Hollywood but Kramer vs Kramer doesn't make it too typical or dramatic instead it shows Mother and Father's point of views with honesty even when they looked like turning ugly in the courtroom. This is the most practical version of fight of A mother who loves her child very much but an unhappy wife ask for his son's custody vs a Father who loves his child very much but couldn't give enough time to his wife due to work commitments. What i personally felt that this film could have got little more emotional and intellectual in the climax and i might have had bunch of tissues. The last scene when Meryl Streep goes up in the life to meet her child could have extended and i would have love to see some emotional and intellectual affair between the Mother and the Kid. Whether it is The original or its Bollywood remake 'Akele Hum Akele Tum' both the films missed a chance of a classic ending that can be remembered forever. Under the smart direction of Robert Benton, Actor Dustin Hoffman does an excellent job in the lead role whereas Meryl Streep as his wife plays supporting role with conviction. Well i loved the kid more (Justin Henry). Overall, this is a Fantastic film but 5 Oscars against films like #ApocalypseNow 'Being There' and 'All That Jazz' .. well, we can certainly have lots of argument on that.

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Abundance of talent makes for cinema's most extraordinary domestic drama,9,4 July 2009,"Normally, movies stay out of the realm of ""domestic drama,"" and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That's not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. That's a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman.The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in Academy Awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits (""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Superman"") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.",Kramer vs. Kramer
45,imseeg,"Incredilby endearing, true to life divorce drama. Oozing with affection for the love of family. Brilliant seventies classic!",10,24 August 2019,"However ugly or depressing divorces might be, this movie is uplifting, oozing with affection and love. What makes this movie so great is the excellent portrayal of the human shortcomings of parents when love has gone, while the love for their children is still strong.My heart melts every time I see it and I am not a sentimental person whatsoever, but this movie touches me deeply with it's honest, heartfelt true to life portrait of the love a parent feels for his/hers own children, who can get torn apart during a divorce. Kids blame themselves for any divorce, that's the nature of their thinking. Parents blame each other, but rarely any grown up blames him or herself for a divorce.Magnificent acting performances by Meryl Streep (she radiates) and Dustin Hofmann. One of the best roles ever by a kid as well. Terrific direction. Beautiful editing and photography. Simple, yet such a powerful soundtrack. Everything about this movie oozes brilliance. I truly think it is one, if not THE best drama of the entire seventies. Incredibly endearing!",Kramer vs. Kramer
46,jzappa,Nearly Great,9,4 August 2008,"Kramer Vs. Kramer is a near-heartening drama about shocking, drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband, in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman, to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless, relentless and impatient, but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite, he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. He's been focused on his career in advertising, and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself, chaos ushers in immediately. He's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile, as he befriends his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime, his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated, subjectified for the audience, the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.",Kramer vs. Kramer

49,ackstasis,"""How much courage does it take to walk out on your kid?""",8,10 December 2007,"'Kramer vs. Kramer' succeeds so tremendously, not because it shows us something that we've never seen before, but because it shows us life as we know it. The relationship between Ted Kramer and his young son Billy is really nothing remarkable  almost every father in the world shares a similar bond with his own son  and yet, paradoxically, this is what makes the film such a remarkable achievement: it is a window into real-life. That year, though 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' was undoubtedly the more impressive piece of cinema, the Academy decided to award the top honours to a film that was more intimate and closer-to-home {perhaps they were also hesitant, after 'The Deer Hunter (1978),' to reward a war picture two years in a row}. 'Kramer vs. Kramer' received, not only Best Picture, but also a well-deserved Best Actor {Dustin Hoffman's first win}, Best Director {Robert Benton}, Best Adapted Screenplay {Robert Benton} and Best Actress in a Supporting Role {Meryl Streep's first win}. Young Justin Henry, aged 8 years, became the youngest actor in history to be nominated for a competitive Oscar.At the beginning of the film, we are immediately aware that Ted Kramer (Hoffman) is not a perfect husband. His commitment to work means that he has largely neglected his strained wife, Joanna (Streep), and, indeed, he isn't even listening to her when she finally announces her intentions to leave him. With Joanna having departed for California in order to ""find herself,"" Ted is left alone to care for their young son Billy (Justin Henry), during which time he must juggle both his working and family lives. As Ted takes up this mammoth task, we notice that, up to this point, he hasn't been much of a father, either, blundering his attempts to make a simple breakfast and having to ask in which grade-level his son belongs. Eventually, however, though it reflects rather poorly on his career, Ted and Billy formulate a truly touching father-son relationship, and, for the first time, Ted seems satisfied with his family life  until, that is, Joanna returns to claim custody of the child.Perhaps it's just being a male that influenced my emotions, but I absolutely loathed Joanna Kramer. The mere notion of a mother walking out on her son, only to return 15 months later with the expectation of receiving custody, left me absolutely livid, and, were it not for the character's final act, I might even have labelled her as the film's ""villain."" However, to do so would probably oppose the primary message of the film, which is that both Ted and Joanna are young Billy's parents, and that they must each come to accept this, and to accept that they are both equally responsible for the well-being of their child. The ending of the film, with the elevator door closing to irreparably separate Ted and Joanna once more {destroying any idealistic hopes that the two would get back together} creates an open-endedness to the story that I thought was very suitable. As in real-life, there is no clear resolution to the story, and the future is hopeful but uncertain.",Kramer vs. Kramer
50,runamokprods,"A very special film, even all these years later",10,28 January 2012,"A wonderful, beautifully acted film about the meanings of love, friendship, and above all parenthood. This is the film where Robert Benton's complex humanism really comes to full flower. In a situation that almost demands taking sides – a sudden divorce leading to an unprepared father taking over childcare only to be challenged for custody when the mother returns 18 months later – Benton manages to make everyone a complex human being, with strengths and weaknesses, trying their best to do the right thing in a painful, messy situation. Hoffman, who has been brilliant so many times playing characters far from himself is perhaps the most moving he's ever been playing a character that director Benton described as really, honestly playing himself – perhaps the hardest character of all. Streep takes a woman who could have easily come off as the villain of the piece, and makes you understand her actions - - even abandoning her little boy. Jane Alexander is wonderful and subtle as the slowly developing friend Hoffman makes as a single father, and young Justin Henry is utterly real in a way few child actors are as the 7 year old stuck in the middle. It's also beautifully, if understatedly shot by Nestor Almendros. It's flaws are minor. Some of the supporting roles, while played by terrific character actors, are a bit more one note and characturish than they need be. And some of the courtroom theatrics feel just a tiny bit well, theatrical. Also, there's a logic point that's always bugged me – why doesn't Hoffman – doing quite well on Madison Avenue, hire a part-time housekeeper or nanny to help him from becoming terminally overloaded by the combination of career and single parenthood? Last family politics have changed enough in 31 years that no longer would the climactic court fight stack up quite the same way – it's no longer a rarity for a man to want custody of his children - but that's not a flaw in the film, just a welcome reminder that some things do get better.And none of the above are enough to detract from the fact that this is storytelling and acting of the highest order.",Kramer vs. Kramer

53,CubsandCulture,While it is dated a moving film of fatherhood.,7,14 January 2019,"I am sure that back in 1979 that the divorce story element was a lot more contentious than it is today. I find that the court proceedings have a little bit of a dulled edge because of that. Nonetheless, the screenplay's sharp observations about the struggles of a workaholic father going through a separation and learning to be a good person still really resonant. It is in the details of being unable to make french toast, or the dread that Hoffman shows during the accident. This is a tasteful drama that is worth seeing.While the film struggles mightily to not take sides and present both Ted/Joanne as flawed fully realized people at fault the decision to spend no time with Joanne in CA wounds the film somewhat. Her inability to see how far Ted has come feels vindictive and unwarranted by the text of the film. Benton and Hoffman both were going through a divorce while making the movie and while they are fair to the female characters the film is too far in the male perspective. There is a undercurrent of too much blame placed on Joanne. Further a few lines about feminism make the film feel regressive.This is only a moderate issue and I think Streep's performance helps to counter much of it. Joanne is always sympathetic as she should be. The film is very straightforward and conventional. It was a dull, but good choice, for Best Picture to end experimental 70's on.",Kramer vs. Kramer
54,estebangonzalez10,A compelling family drama with remarkable performances.,8,4 September 2015,"""Mommy stayed here longer than she wanted because she loves you so much. And the reason why Mommy couldn't stay anymore... was because she couldn't stand me. She didn't leave because of you. She left because of me.""Robert Benton's third feature film, Kramer vs. Kramer, still stands out as his best. This 1979 family drama which explores interpersonal relationships and the effect divorce has on the family, remains very relevant in today's society. It is one of those rare classics that has managed to age very well due to its universal theme. In order for an authentic drama like this to work you need a strong script and believable actors. Kramer vs. Kramer has both, Robert Benson did an amazing job with the screenplay adaptation of Avery Corman's novel and the dialogue in the film feels authentic while avoiding any false notes. And of course you couldn't have had anyone better than Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep to play the divorced couple. Hoffman was already at the height of his career, while Streep was just getting started proving she's always been an out of this world actress. Both actors won their first Academy Awards for this film, and it wouldn't be their last. But in a film like this no matter how good the adult characters are, you need to have a child who can win over the sympathy of the audience and engage them emotionally. Benton made a huge gamble when he hired inexperienced Justin Henry for the role, but it payed off marvelously. At only 8 years old Henry was nominated for his supporting role. The scenes he shares with Hoffman are endearing and the relationship between the two is the center of the film. It was the subtle moments that the two shared together that stuck with me the most, like the scene where the kid challenges his father's authority by eating the ice cream. These were improvised scenes, but they added to the authenticity of the film. That relationship between both of them is key, as we witness the transition and evolution of Hoffman's character.The film opens with a shot of Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) packing her clothes in a suitcase while she waits for her husband, Ted (Dustin Hoffman) to return home from work so that she can break the news to him that she is leaving him. Apparently she has been unhappy for quite some time now and she wants to discover who she is. Despite being heartbroken about having to abandon her young son, Billy (Justin Henry), she is convinced she has to go. Ted, who hasn't the slightest clue about housekeeping, must now learn to manage his work while taking care of his son. During the early scenes we see what an inexperienced father he is, he can't prepare breakfast for Billy without burning everything. But as the movie progresses we begin to see the transformation that Ted goes through and what a caring father he becomes. His career does begin to suffer and he begins struggling to keep his job, but he has learned to put his son's life before his own. With the help of his friendly neighbor, Margaret (Jane Alexander), he becomes an expert at parenting, but that is around the time that Joanna returns back to the city and tells Ted she wants to take her son with him. A court battle for their son's custody ensues as neither parent refuses to live without their son. The film builds a great father and son dynamic during most of its runtime and that is what makes the courtroom drama so compelling near the end because the stakes have been settled. I don't think this film would've won the Oscar for Best Picture if it weren't for those intense scenes during the trial. The testimony each parent gives is compelling and the performances in those scenes were superb, but I actually enjoyed the quieter and more subtle moments in this film. The scenes were Hoffman is sharing some time at the park with his son or simply reading a story to him. Those were the moments that made this film ring true and authentic. I think that the film could've ended on a stronger note if it decided to have ended some five minutes before it actually did because it ties things up too neatly at the end. The final kitchen scene would've been the perfect moment to end it, but I won't complain too much because the film is compelling and the performances had me engaged from the very opening scene. Kramer vs. Kramer still resonates with audiences today and it is a great example of how to make a compelling family drama about the effect that divorce has on the family. I enjoyed every minute of it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Kramer vs. Kramer
55,mattkratz,wonderful!,9,26 January 2011,"While I will admit that this movie is pretty much dated (themes, camera work, etc.), it is still a marvelous movie. Dustin Hoffman gives a terrific performance and deserved the Oscar he received as best actor as a career-driven advertising exec whose wife (Meryl Streep) all of a sudden walks out on him and his son, leaving them to fend for themselves. The problem is that with Hoffman, work and career have always come first, and he hardly knows his son. He hardly has any housekeeping skills (as demonstrated by a hilarious french toast scene at the beginning), but things progress. He gradually becomes a better father. By the time the mother returns and decides she wants the kid back, they have bonded so much that he fights her for custody. The courtroom scene is memorable, as is the entire movie. It deserved every Oscar it got (picture, actor, supporting actress, etc.) as well as the terrific review by Leonard Maltin. Other memorable scenes include when Hoffman rushes the kid to the hospital and the bedroom scene. I guarantee you will love this movie-a must see! *** 1/2 out of ****",Kramer vs. Kramer
56,smatysia,miscellaneous observations,7,18 June 2002,"The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a pretty weak field for Best Picture that year. I think ""Apocalypse Now"" should have taken it, but the Academy probably felt it was too violent and strange, plus Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unlikeable character. I don't usually compliment directors, but I really liked that bit with the elevator doors. Grade: B",Kramer vs. Kramer
57,jimbo-53-186511,"Worthy subject matter and well meaning, but with one major problem",6,29 November 2014,"Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is an advertising executive whose career means everything to him. In fact, it means so much to him that his wife Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) can no longer tolerate his behaviour anymore. Joanna leaves Ted and also leaves their 8 year old child in his care. However, Ted finds himself in new territory when he now finds that he has to struggle juggling both working full-time and looking after his son.This is a film that for me will always be relevant - it's actually probably more relevant now than it was when it was made as divorce rates are probably higher now than they were in the 1970's. The film begins OK; Joanna leaves Ted and we find ourselves engaged when Ted is forced to actually take an active role in being a parent. It shows how much he relied on Joanna and clearly he took her for granted (of course he only realises how much she actually did after she left him). This is all fine to begin with, but the problem I had with this film is Joanna's disappearance for 15 months. 15 months? Really? What kind of mother would do that? I expected her to perhaps leave Ted with their kid for a few days possibly a week to give him a lesson in parenting, but I just couldn't accept that any rational parent would disappear for that long. Later in the film, Joanna does explain her reasons for going away, but I still didn't buy it. I don't care what anyone else says, abandoning your kid for that long is unacceptable!! There are many things that this film gets right and one thing I did like about it is that it does, at least, represent both parents as being flawed individuals. It would have been very easy for the writers to put all the blame at the door of one of the parents, but this would have been both unfair and unrealistic. There are many humorous and heart-felt moments during the film - many of which involved Ted and his son. I'll admit that I was pleased that his son ended up bonding better with Ted towards the end.Despite the fact that Ted was made out to be the villain of the piece at the start of the film, I personally found that I connected more with his character than I did with Joanna. I think the main reason for this is that I saw that he was flawed as a person rather than bad - look at the pressure he was under at work (even his boss kept telling him that his work is more important than his family - he didn't use those exact words, but it's quite clear that he wanted Ted to put his job before his family). Yes Ted should have remembered that blood is thicker than water, but at the end of the day he needed to keep his job to provide for his family. He made mistakes, but I actually liked his character. It perhaps would have been better if Joanna's character was developed better as we would have then got more of an insight into her characters thoughts/feelings and I would have then been able to connect to her character. However, her character is quite thinly written so it's actually impossible to do this. Kramer vs Kramer is an enjoyable film that is funny and heart-felt and both Hoffman and Streep were excellent. It probably deserves a 7 or 8 out of 10, but I was so annoyed by Joanna's actions that I had to downgrade it to a 6 out of 10. It's still a film that I would whole heartedly recommend watching though.",Kramer vs. Kramer
58,davispittman,Very moving drama that is powered by the amazing performances,9,7 April 2017,"This best picture academy award winning film really is deserving of that victory. It's got everything that a great film needs to succeed. First of all, the acting is great, I mean spot on! Meryl Streep shines the most out of all of them, she deserved that best actress Oscar oh so much! She plays the wife of Dustin Hoffman and mother of a 6 year old boy. She decides to leave her husband because she is so unhappy. Her very emotional performance as Joanna is one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie period. Dustin Hoffman also gives a great performance. His character spends the vast majority of the movie trying to be a better father to his son, learning how to take on both responsibilities of his soon to be ex-wife and his. I also adored the child actor that plays their son in the movie, one of the youngest academy award nominees ever! He is such an impressive young actor, it's amazing to me to see child actors be so professional seeming and mature in their on screen performances. The script for this film is written with such great detail. It really focuses on the father-son relationship, and it also hones in on Joanna and why she left and why she wishes to reconnect with her son after leaving. Love and family is at the heart of this movie. I absolutely adore this film and I suggest it 100%! 9/10 for Kramer vs Kramer.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Highly recommended to watch.",Kramer vs. Kramer
60,gcd70,Moving Beyond Words,7,13 February 2008,"Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.One of ""Kramer v. Kramer's"" great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton, who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with ""Places in the Heart"", where he showed, as in ""Kramer v. Kramer"", that he has a natural ability for working with children.The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations, two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As said wife Joanne, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again, and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came his way.Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect.Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go.Certainly if nothing else, ""Kramer v. Kramer"" demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child, especially not the child himself.Saturday, June 10, 1995 - T.V.Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction, both from Robert Benton, it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle, and a top cast of extras.This highly emotional, heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 Academy Awards for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Streep).Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - T.V.",Kramer vs. Kramer
61,MarieGabrielle,Still effective....,9,2 September 2007,"And an affecting story, at that. The acting is temperate, not overdone, and the situation is real. Dustin Hoffman as a mid-level ad executive, suddenly dealing with his wife's desertion. The Streep character certainly comes off as cold, initially, but there are subtle layers of confusion and indecision, as anyone who has ever endured a divorce or family estrangement will be quite familiar with.I do not agree this is a black and white issue; few human stories are. The interactions with Justin Henry and Hoffman are memorable and heartbreaking at times, the child confused as to why his mother would just leave the family home.A few good cameo performances with Jane Alexander as the concerned neighbor, Howard Duff as Shaunessey, Kramer's family law attorney, and George Coe as Hoffman's heartless boss who fires him even as he is at the height of a custody battle.Overall, a significant film which still holds up today. 9/10.",Kramer vs. Kramer

63,Movie-ManDan,The Best Movie Ever Made About Divorce and Custody.,10,25 October 2014,"Dustin Hoffman had already been riding high in the movies long before doing this. Things like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy showed that he was then and is now one of the best of the best. Kramer vs Kramer is arguably his best movie and most powerful performance. The only other arguably better is Rain Man. But Kramer vs Kramer and Rain Man are vastly different, with both leaving equal impacts.Ted Kramer (Hoffman) is a successful workaholic advertising executive. One night after returning home late with big news, he finds out his wife (Streep), who feels isolated and socially abandoned, is leaving him and their son Billy (Henry). Ted's frustrations about being both parents to Billy and doing well in his job become virtually unbearable. While Billy must deal with the abandonment of his mother and the weak relationship he has with his father. Just as Ted starts becoming a good parent to Billy and a success again at work, Joanna returns wanting her son back. Ted bears a slim chance of winning.I read the Avery Corman novel before seeing the movie. It was the first and only time I have ever legitimately cried while reading. Some things in the movie have been changed, but most things have just been taken away. The novel isn't long, but the movie would likely be a miniseries if went directly by the book. So is the book better than the movie? With a different cast, it would have been. As mentioned before, Hoffman gives the performance of a lifetime as a pressured yuppie. Hoffman plays Ted as a heroic type that will do anything he can to be the best parent he can be. Meryl Streep won her first Oscar for and is also one of her most underrated roles. One of the themes in the movie is women's rights and gender equality, that is seen as Joanna gives reasons for walking out on her husband and son. Justin Henry was just a little kid that gave a better performance than half of everybody in 1979. In the 70s, divorce was an uncommon thing. Now, divorces happen left, right and centre. So Kramer vs Kramer is perhaps more relevant today than in the 70s. With divorce and custody as the main themes, gender equality, social abandonment and work balancing are other themes that are shown very well in this. You will watch this movie and never forget how it impacts you.",Kramer vs. Kramer
64,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Even Meryl Streep couldn't ruin this movie,8,15 February 2019,"Nominally, Kramer vs Kramer refers to Ted vs Joanna, with custody of the kid being the payoff. But for at least half the movie Kramer vs Kramer is really Ted vs Billy in a war of wills.
All 3 principals are eminently believable as real people, with Hoffman delivering a relatively restrained performance. Streep's usual crying act being relegated to the fringes where it belongs. And the kid stealing the movie with his natural acting.
It's a testament to this movie's enduring appeal that has survived Streep's career turning into a cliche of bawling, tics and bad accents. Though I'd like to point out that SCTV had her figured out very early on when the Farm Film Report's Billy Saw Heerock and Big Jim McBob (John Candy and Joe O'Flaherty) brought her (well, Catherine O'Hara playing Streep) on the show and ''blew her up real good.""",Kramer vs. Kramer
65,Kingslaay,An Incredible film,9,20 February 2017,"Kramer vs Kramer is definitely one for the ages. It is story of a workaholic husband (Dustin Hoffman) who is left carrying the 'baby' or his young son after his mother (Meryl Streep) leaves the home. She is unhappy with her life and seeks something else. We see a troubled and frustrated Hoffman try to take care of his son and be on top of a demanding job. The realism and ease which this is conveyed is effortless. Throughout the story we see the son and his father clash only to make up and become closer. Hoffman also befriends a female family friend in the building showing his growth. When we see Hoffman and Billy wake up and make breakfast together in silence we observe a great routine this family has developed. No talking is needed because it has become their way of life that the two easily carry out, watching this you will assume this has always been the state of affairs. Touching moments that resonate with the audience are when Hoffman teaches his son to ride a bike or takes him to his play and helps young Billy remember his lines. When Hoffman is fired and about hit another hurdle he is able to quickly secure another job in his field and shows off his office to his son. The bond between father and son is emotional but not overtly emotional which really works in the films favor as appealing to all audiences. He has been able to fulfill both roles as father and provider, he has made it work. The bond is threatened to be broken when the estranged mother returns and seeks custody of Billy. During the trial period one morning Billy looks up at his father, appreciative. When the two embrace and Billy starts crying no words are needed in the scene as it speaks volumes, a perfect scene. You can see both sides at the end. You are supportive and rally behind the heroic father who has managed to build a happy and balanced life for his son while holding down a decent job, he made it work. Yet you are also sympathetic towards the mother, who while she was selfish she may have been dealing with many issues. The film purposely left out these details to make you wonder and not make an objective assessment. So when it comes to the trial it may be difficult to completely decide which parent Billy should be with. Hence is the power and beautiful film making of Kramer vs Kramer because the audience can try and reach their own verdict which may not be so easy.The brilliance of this film also lies in its simplicity and the simple way the the story is told to its audience. You are easily taken on a journey, you understand it, you believe it and most importantly you feel it. The acting is first class. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in his portrayal and very worthy of his Best Actor Oscar. Billy and Streep also give very good performances. The music also deserves praise, not only is it consistent it is quite beautiful. Kramer vs Kramer won 5 Oscars, including best film and director. I believe 7.8 is far too low for this simple and yet perfectly executed film. It definitely deserves a spot in the top 250 films as it is truly a classic and definitely one for the ages. 9.5/10",Kramer vs. Kramer
66,PredragReviews,"As ""Human"" as you can get.",8,11 May 2016,"Kramer vs. Kramer is one of these films, though I would argue that it's not aptly named, since they're not really at each other's throats the whole time, and when they are (which isn't ever as vicious as some of today's court cases), it's only during the third act of the film.The film starts off by introducing all of the principal characters. The mother, Joanna (Meryl Streep) is putting her child (Justin Henry) to bed, and Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is having a late-night talk with a co-worker. By the time he gets home, Joanna says she's leaving him and the plot is set up. What follows is a long series of scenes which show how Ted has to adjust to being a single parent, and culminates in a courtroom battle as Joanna, after a long period, fights for custody of her son. What I feel like the film does well is not paint everything as black or white. Ted isn't portrayed as a wholly perfect father, yet Joanna isn't portrayed as a villain. I will say, however, that not as much screen time is allotted to Meryl Streep so that her character's motivations come off as a bit selfish at first. Still, the meat of the story is in how her decision to leave affects her husband and child, and there was certainly a lot to process.

The performances were also top-notch, even from the child actor portraying the son. This is a very emotional film at times, and every such moment felt real and believable.

69,sharky_55,I'm all you got.,8,4 June 2016,"Kramer vs. Kramer begins with the picking up of the ashes of an eight year marriage. We are left trying to assemble the broken pieces of the Kramer household in the period where we would be conventionally just being introduced and warming up to the characters. So it is a mystery, in a sense, working backwards - clues are laid out in front of us and we must try to decipher them and answer the question of why Joanna Kramer might want to walk out on her husband, but more importantly, her seven year old son. For a moment there is the suggestion that there may be a disability in play, but soon we realise that he is just another clumsy seven year old who wants ice cream instead of dinner. What Benton does here is use Joanna's absence as actual narrative. The wide swathes of the motherhood experience missing from the household tell us all that we need to know about her previous role. Billy is well-drilled; he knows exactly what brand of cereal and detergent is the best, has memorised where all the kitchen utensils are, and from rubbing of his mother's shoulders seems to be the better cook too. Ted knows none of this. He doesn't even know what grade his son is in. These early sequences of him struggling to reconcile his new duties as a father and handling a major account at his work are the easy, sentimental stuff that must inevitably occur when we are dealing with stories of parenthood. Yes, Billy may be a little brat at times, but he is also only seven, and Ted must re-learn this again and again. Until they are finally bonding, and must bide their time before it is ripped away from them. It is not so hard to get through this familiar material because Hoffman is such a natural at the role - the moment where he sees Billy wobbly take off on his bicycle and his face creases up the widest smile you have ever seen is so believable and such a relief because we too have been taken on this journey and we know the baggage that lies heavy in his heart. The early, chaotic french toast breakfast is later masterfully contrasted with another breakfast; again it is french toast, and this time they have mastered the routine, but there is a deafening silence because of what is to come, and they are trying to enjoy every last moment of it, but also trying to pretend like it isn't coming. Many have labelled this a court-room drama. I think this is the wrong tag. It comes with the assumptions that the dialogue comes thick and fast and there are pre-determined moments where we gasp and the lawyers strike dramatic poses and swap steely gazes. This is nothing as flashy and surface-level. The lawyers themselves are still snappy and ruthless. Joanna's in particular has completely rid himself of any heart and narrowed his sights on not only getting Billy back but also destroying all constructs that Ted's fatherhood might have erected. He repeatedly cuts off Margaret because he is not interested in the backstory but only getting his conviction soundbites that paint a much different story than what is really happening. No, the meat of the story is here, but it is not within the court system and the way it strips down everything to nothing but cold, hard facts and twists their intentions cruelly. As each side pleads their case both Joanna and Ted begin to realise that their battle is a fruitless one if Billy is to suffer for it, and start to turn back on their own arguments. The clear cuts and divides in the law are revealed to be not adequately equipped to handle such delicate and emotionally jumbled issues. If this wanted to fill seats it would have had young Billy himself take the stand and somehow magically see things clearer than the adults and repair the broken marriage. But he is only seven. Rarely can a film be so impartial. It asks nothing of its characters but complete honesty. Are their egos worth ripping apart the life of their young son? In the end, they make the right decision.",Kramer vs. Kramer

You lead a busy work-schedule and it is impossible to balance your job with looking after your son. And yet you need to work in order to put food on the table.This is the dilemma of the film. This excellent man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), advertising executive is just given his agency's biggest new account. After spending the evening chatting with his boss about handling a new and very large account, he returns home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) in the process of leaving him.Ted is left to raise their son Billy (Justin Henry) by himself. Ted and Billy begin to resent each other as Ted no longer has time to carry his increased workload, and Billy misses the love and attention he received from his mother. After many months of unrest, Ted and Billy begin to cope with the situation and eventually grow to love and care for one another.Then we find the most controversial part of the film: the battle for custody of Billy. It seems to me SHAMEFUL when two adults fight over custody their child.Finally, the court awards custody to Joanna, not so much due to the evidence on both sides but due to the assumption that a child is best raised by his mother. Ted discusses appealing the case, but his lawyer warns that Billy himself would have to take the stand in the resulting trial and Ted cannot bear the thought of submitting his child to such an ordeal. He therefore decides not to contest custody.On the morning that Billy is to move in with Joanna, Ted and Billy make breakfast together, mirroring the meal that Ted tried to cook the first morning after Joanna left. They hug in a very tender moment as they both know this is their last breakfast together. Joanna calls from the ground floor, asking Ted to come down to talk. She tells Ted that, while she loves Billy and wants him with her, she knows that he is already home, and that his true home is with Ted. She will therefore not take him. As she enters the elevator, she asks her ex-husband ""How do I look?"". The movie ends with the elevator doors closing on the emotional Joanna, right after Ted answers, ""You look terrific,"" as she heads upstairs to talk to Billy.Every cloud has a silver lining. Ted fought for the love of his son and WON. In conclusion: LOVE ALWAYS WINS IN THE END.Excellent acting by all actors involved. During the filming Dustin Hoffman actually bonded with Justin Henry and he stated that he looked upon Justin as his very own son. Meryl Streep has a small role in the film but she is effective in the character she portrays of a frustrated woman who sees no worth in the life of a housewife.An excellent film to watch with your family.

I'm glad that it won more Oscars than ""Apocalypse Now"" because it deserved.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a great film, generally well made and balanced. And it stands the test of time, too. Not only it doesn't look too dated, but also its cultural impact is long-lasting and its realistic story remains as significant as it was in 1979. They don't make movies like this today.This movie is depressing but it has humor as well. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the movie or place to discuss such thing. For a movie like this, such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary.The story is interesting. The actors's chemistry is perfect. All of the actors are great, but the 3 main ones are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance ever here as Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And cute little Justin Henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna.The score is all Vivaldi. Simply dazzling.This motion picture has also good character development. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust these responsibilities with his job after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes how though life is, with the problems in his job and the return of Joanna, who wants the custody of their son. But even Joanna changes for better.This movie has also some though things, such as courtroom scenes where both Ted and Joanna face brutal character assassinations unleashed by the lawyers. Another though thing to see is when poor Billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy (a plane) and gets seriously injured on the face. But then again, the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense: his father runs quickly and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital.Overall, this is a movie which is a good lesson of life.This should definitely be on Top 250.",Kramer vs. Kramer

It has such excellent narrative drive. Once you stick Kramer vs Kramer on, and Alice Kramer leaves Ted to juggle work and their young son, telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself - you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them. And even once you know how things do turn out, each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its a joy to watch it happen again and again.Make no mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment: its a very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved.10/10.For one of the best scripts (born out of conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was going through a divorce at the time) ever written, executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly. Not to mention what a great, involving story it is. Put simply, a perfect film.",Kramer vs. Kramer

The entire cast is excellent, but then again, it had to be in order to keep up with Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep.  It didn't take me long to get hooked on this film, and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good, this is top-notch entertainment.

78,AhmedSpielberg99,Let the characters defend themselves!,9,16 November 2018,"I can't believe how many times I snapped my opinion! That's for the most part because the movie refused to take sides, but in a very remarkable way. Simply, the movie seems as if it had shied away from interfering with the Kramers' divorce subject, and therefore let its characters to compete with each other on making viewer biased towards him/her. And that's exactly what made the main characters flesh out, of course besides the fact that they are played by Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep.Both Dustin Hoffman (one of my favorite actors of all-time), and Meryl Streep (one of, if not the best actress of all-time) gave unbelievably authentic performances that could be the best performances of their respected careers. They definitely deserved their Oscars!The only issue I have with Robert Benton's masterpiece that I could have easily ignored is that I found the interrogation part of the courtroom scene was a bit tad monotonous only because I became totally torn between both Ted and Joanna because the baffling honesty of their justifications. I know that sounds more like a good thing, but I got tired at the end of the sequence of the constant rejections of the defense lawyers. So maybe the sequence could have been a bit shorter as we became aware how it would end.Kramer vs. Kramer is easily the most sensitive, absorbing, and heartbreaking movie I've seen of its kind. In part because the exceptional cast, but largely because Robert Benton's significant adapted screenplay that is as simple as it's profound, and indisputably because of his tangible and nuanced direction.(9.5/10)",Kramer vs. Kramer

80,Bolesroor,"Good, Not Great",5,2 May 2005,"""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" is a movie-of-the-week made moving by grade A+ actors. This is not to discount the film... it isn't terrible, but without the great performances by both Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep- who flesh out their rather-thin characters into nearly realistic people- it is much ado about nothing.I was disappointed watching the film because there was nothing memorable about it... it was a slight experience marked by a lack of substance. Even on the second viewing many years later I had forgotten the film as quickly as the end credits had rolled. What WAS important about this movie was that it represented the first-time Hollywood really acknowledged the downfall of the American family, an endangered species being increasingly torn apart by divorce in which the children emerged as victims and pawns. I'm sure it was more sensational at the time of it's release... but today a woman leaving her husband and forcing him to raise their son alone is not going to win Best Picture... a film today with a plot that tame might never get made. I suspect in fact that ""Kramer's"" Oscar sweep was due more to the film's amazingly talented actors- both at the top of their game- than the actual film itself. Streep is very good in a role that is *entirely* unsympathetic... we're given no reason for her departure and no rationale for abandoning her child. A lesser actress in this role would have had the audience hissing, but Meryl Streep gives us at least some insight as to Mrs. Kramer's motivations. Dustin Hoffman is great, believable as a father and human enough to engage anyone. The film sidesteps many key issues very cleverly, such as never showing us Mr. & Mrs. Kramer happy together, a necessity since Hoffman and Streep are not only unlikely as man and wife, they also share zero chemistry, unless of course they're out-acting one another from opposite sides of the courtroom.A film that stands the test of time will linger on your mind, bear repeated viewings, and be just as vital today as the day it was made... ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" is long past its expiration date. The performances are still watchable, but not essential in either actor's canon; Hoffman and Streep have both been in many timeless films... ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" is not one of them.",Kramer vs. Kramer
81,khatcher-2,Drama with still valid sociological aspects,7,7 December 2001,"Ever since `Midnight Cowboy' I have been on the lookout for films with Dustin Hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed. Ever since `Kramer vs Kramer' I have been on the lookout for films with Meryl Streep and have mostly not been disappointed. She gave a superb performance, really one of her best, in `Sophie's Decision' and I lapped her up in `Out of Africa'. That these two actors came together over 20 years ago for `Kramer vs Kramer' was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society.
On divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time, though the kids seem to suffer most..Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes: even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just simply magnificent. Just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? Benton managed it, and of course with Hoffman there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing, and convincing. Justin Henry's performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time. The best thing, once again, was the naturalness, there was no going over the top, so frequent these days.This film came up again on the small screen the other night, though I have had it in my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything.

82,RossRivero99,A brilliantly executed drama film,10,12 April 2014,"Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer really shows all of us of what kind of emotional effect a divorce between parents can really feel like to their children.

While Hoffman's character takes care of his son he gets let go from his first job by his first boss then gets another job on the next day which is 3 days before Christmas. Director Robert Benton has created a drama movie masterpiece while creating this film. Also the movie got the main people in the film their first Oscars, which was Dustin Hoffman for best actor and Meryl Streep for best supporting actress.

It isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but it does not mean it still isn't important. I thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it. The performances were the best positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of his best roles he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him. Billy, who is Hoffman's son, played another great performance along with Meryl Streep, playing the depressed mother of Billy. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it.

The two bond and become very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is going perfect Ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son. Ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with Meryl Streep, and young Justin Henry is impressive. It's a sad emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well-made and inspiring film.

87,christophe92300,Good execution,7,18 May 2013,"What strikes is the impeccable acting of Dustin Hoffman in the role of the father and the incredibly natural young Justin Henry (Billy), largely contributing to the quality of this feature. A lot of people rave about Meryl Streep's performance when she isn't very present and has only a good scene at the courthouse... and that's it.As for the scenario, the story is quite banal — maybe less at the time — but very accurate: the situations, the dialogues ring true which is already remarkable. But the movie suffers from a badly structured plot: the story is set too quickly with no proper pre-split introduction which among others biases the viewer's judgement on Joana; then, the first part seems a bit too long and sometimes not enough dynamic whereas the legal outcome is expeditious. There is also a certain coldness towards the characters, to whom you hardly get attached to despite some very touching scenes.One can also regret the cinematography a bit too academic, with no big flaw but no particular cachet, which emphasizes a bit more the convenient aspect of the movie, still good but from which no real power emerges.",Kramer vs. Kramer
88,jhaggardjr,Brilliant drama,10,8 June 2000,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in ""Rainman"", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable. **** (out of four)",Kramer vs. Kramer
89,Offworld_Colony,I've never seen a Robert Benton film...,10,17 February 2020,"...but now I'm hooked and not often does a film pop and resonate so much that I want to envelop myself in an entire filmography of its creators.Additionally, I expected this film (one I have never seen) to be a comedy, the poster and the title made me look forward to a zany, light-hearted, early-80's family picture with some sentiment and darker sprinkles towards the end. Boy was I wrong. Yes, the film develops its sense of humour, beautifully I might add, but it's first and foremost a serious drama about evolving gender roles, mental health, love, jobs and parenthood.The Vivaldi music is perfectly placed and utilised, the film encompasses so many little character quirks and small moments without being unfilmic. It manages to have an intimate male/female relationship without it ever looking like it will blossom in to cliche romantic love and there's no question that Streep and Hoffman won't get back together which focus the movie. Despite the film's theatricality and ancientnesss, it's still a relevant film today I feel in many ways. Today it would be made to show a more female POV (and perhaps it should) but at the time I think it very much set out to show other Men that Men could have the same hearts.",Kramer vs. Kramer
90,mcfly-31,Audience vs. Audience,5,5 July 2010,"Perhaps I saw this too late. 30 years too late. I kinda, sorta experienced this in a way, being a child of a 70s divorce. But as a kid, I hardly understood it. Hearing my mom lambast my dad for 30 years since has shed enough light on it, but as a film, I dunno.The success of this film ($98 million dollar box-office in 1979!!) and the all the major awards is gobbled up, were definitely a sign of its time. A hot-button issue in the late 70s, of Disco Dads ditching their families for a little extended adolescence on the tiled squares. The only nuance here is that the roles are reversed, and it's dad who's left holding the kid. The wife portrayed here is not a partier, but does go the ""I need to find myself"" route and disappears for a year.This was my first problem with the film: Streep is barely in it. She bolts for nearly the first hour of the film, not allowing for the title to live up to itself until it's much too late. What follows is a series of vignettes of Hoffman adjusting to the single-dad routine, and the expected chaos it brings. Work-wise, dating-wise, it's all effected. It's during these sequences that Hoffman probably didn't care that Streep was absent, because he's given a tour-de-force playground to carry the film with. Not sure if it was Oscar-worthy, but definitely your typical Hoffman likability.Streep, on the other hand, doesn't work here. When finally glimpsed, she's staring like a stalker through a restaurant window, and of course, shows up later demanding the kid back. Her lawyer's slimeball tactics make her come off worse because we don't really know what *she* was doing in her year away. Which is another direction the film desperately needed to go into. If you want to contrast the breakdown of family and marriage, we need to see a cause, how both parents cope apart, and finally a resolution, to garner a full understanding of both sides. All we know is that Streep went West and got a therapist. Woooooah.As far as Henry is concerned, he wasn't staggering, but he delivered. Again, just like his mother, there are moments where we can't stand him, and he loses our sympathy. Fortunately, by the end of the film, he's come to his father's side and we pull for them as a unit, not just for Hoffman. In typical Hollywood fashion, they go for his waterworks to bleed ours, and it'll be effective for some. It didn't get to me, but that might be a testament to director Benton, for not overdoing it. Just the right note was hit with the kid's weepy reactions.Major demerits for the film's editing, which was often choppy and ill-timed. The fall off the jungle gym and the peeing bits were sloppily constructed. And lest I forget the lack of a musical score. They use the same Italian restaurant cue like three times! And it's massively inappropriate for a film of this nature. You feel like you should ready yourself for some flamenco dancers to enter the frame. Plus the infamous JoBeth Williams moment seemed like a forced laugh that just looked eye-buggingly awkward. Tack on an abrupt ending...the film has its flaws.I think the biggest would be the story's effectiveness. Even placing myself in a 1979 time-frame didn't help, as this didn't have enough punch for a feature film. Hoffman works, cooks, chats, walks the kid to school, gets a lawyer, on and on. It's all too brisk. Performances save it, yes, from being totally dismissed, but undoubtedly is a film that wouldn't have the same impact today.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Yet at the same time I can't help but wonder if the film, by leaving her to the bookends, reduced her to the mere emotional and irrational woman trope, saved at the end by the easily redeemed (it is admittedly a poignant journey through parenthood) formerly absent husband and father. This issue aside, it's certainly clear at least that each and every individual scene is written and acted marvelously.",Kramer vs. Kramer
92,roghache,Wrenching custody battle highlights anguish of divorce,7,21 March 2006,"This movie is a classic work of cinema that captures vividly the agony of divorce, primarily from the perspective of the father. Dustin Hoffman displays sheer perfection in his role as a newly divorced dad who must adjust to the demanding role of sole caregiver to his young son, Billy, all the while trying to juggle these new parental demands with his job responsibilities. Meryl Streep is competent in the extremely unsympathetic role of the self centered mother who feels ignored, unappreciated, and generally put upon by her workaholic husband and goes off to seek her own self fulfillment, unfortunately abandoning her poor, innocent young son in the process.The story begins when Joanna Kramer seeks a divorce from said workaholic husband, Ted, who admittedly, and not to his credit, has put his advertising career ahead of his family. She leaves their little boy, Billy, in the care of her husband, who really in a sense doesn't even know his son, and must now learn to do all the mundane little tasks (such as cooking breakfast) that of course Joanna always used to do. In the process, Ted develops a genuinely close bond with Billy, and vice versa. Later Joanna returns, wants Billy back, and a custody battle ensues...Kramer vs. Kramer. The film gives a marvelous portrayal of Ted's wrenching situation as he has the responsibilities of single parenthood foisted upon him, in addition of course to coping with the devastation of marital break up. We see Ted getting to know both his son and his way around the kitchen, developing a mutual sense of closeness with Billy, and engaging in all the touching little daily routines the pair establish in their household. Above all, the devastation of this father is conveyed vividly, as he faces the frightening prospect of losing custody of his son. Personally, I found Joanna so intensely self absorbed and undependable, I felt like slapping her most of the time and cannot imagine that she would elicit much sympathy from the majority of viewers. Parenthood is not a role that provides for sabbatical leave and her attitude of ""Now I'm back and ready to be a mother again"" failed to cut it with me.The court battle is riveting, especially as we cheer so totally for the ill treated father here. It shows the justice system's tendency to favor the mother, unless she is declared unfit. I personally see this as the case here, since Joanna has abandoned her son for her own selfish pursuits. However, the judge of course doesn't see matters quite from this point of view. Also, the film highlights the court's definition of parental fitness in terms of financial success. Joanna (the unstable, undependable, irresponsible parent) has in fact obtained a good employment position since she abandoned her motherhood role and now earns a substantial salary, while Ted (the stable, dependable, and responsible parent) has unfortunately been demoted due to the time constraints of single fatherhood.The movie gives a masterful portrayal of this father's struggle and of course the overall anguish of divorce, though unfortunately NOT told from the viewpoint of its major victim...the child.",Kramer vs. Kramer
93,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,This one hits! So good & so hard! Let it rain,9,16 November 2020,"Quite often great movies are bridges to other great movies. I watched Marriage Story (2019) this week and loved it deeply - several people read my review of that and referenced Kramer Vs. Kramer. I have heard this name mentioned on occasion throughout my life but never had any idea what type of film it was. When some film nut friends of mine called it ""the same film as Marriage Story, but better"" I had to check it out. To my satisfaction, it was currently streaming free on Amazon Prime.I loved this movie just as much as Marriage Story, and while they are extremely similar, especially in their second halves, they both offer completely different rewarding elements. When honing in on a relationship, every movie is going to have its own identity and be worthwhile as long as the characters are fleshed out with enough depth and sincerity. And this and Marriage Story both accomplish that thoroughly. The main difference for me was that while in Marriage Story I mostly placed myself in the husband's shoes, this film primarily put me in the seven year old son's shoes. This film does much more focusing on how the marital turmoil is disrupting the development of the son at such an impressionable age. As someone who had my parents get divorced when I was 10, and quickly had my relationship with my father become estranged then only have that slowly increase for the rest of his life, I related to this story on a very deep level and it was a very emotional experience - much more so even than Marriage Story.Dustin Hoffman always has a strong presence, but I believe this is my favorite role I have ever seen him in. His transformation occurs quickly and with great force and a lot of heart - it's phenomenal. I recently watched Rain Man for the first time and though he did a great job, I found that movie to be pretty mediocre compared to this one. This is the oldest movie I have seen Meryl Streep in, and her performance is also very notable - her character has a very unique presence, mostly in the sense that her strongest characteristic is her absence. She's not all there, physically OR mentally - it's unique, and complex, and feels very human. In the end, there are a lot of tears, and it's definitely one of those ""when she cries, I cry"" movies. There's something iconic about her every time she cries in this film.There's a neutrality to this film that puts it above most movies. That's what real life is usually like - no real endings, just polar elements that exist and continue simultaneously. If you're in the mood for a good family or breakup drama, this is one of the strongest offerings I have ever seen. This won Best Picture in 1979 for a reason - totally worthy! You wanna cry? This one will probably do it for you! Highly recommended.",Kramer vs. Kramer
94,h-28658,A very well acted film.,7,12 July 2020,"Dustin Hoffman as Ted is very impressive as his life changes and becoming a single parent. The way he has to navigate work life and parent life has its ups and downs. Hoffman is funny at times, very emotional and has the facial expressions and mannerisms to make me care.",Kramer vs. Kramer
95,dr_clarke_2,More complex than it first appears,10,10 June 2020,"Kramer vs. Kramer is often described as a legal drama, which is technically true but an oversimplification. Actually, Robert Benton's 1979 Academy Award winner is about the struggle between Ted and Joanna Kramer for custody of their son following their divorce. The issue of father's rights is just as relevant today as it was in 1979; but whilst it is easy to think of the film as a rallying cry for fathers in Ted's position, it's far more complicated than that description would suggest.
The film opens with Joanna Kramer leaving her husband Ted, walking out on him and their son Billy. Ted's life fundamentally changes, as he is forced to prioritise his son over his career and the first half of the film charts his struggles to look after Billy very convincingly. It also makes him realise that Joanna's departure was probably his fault as he failed to understand what she was feeling. Indeed, whilst we are expected to side with Ted (and for the most part we do) based on very little information about why the couple split up, her stated belief during the first part of the film that she is incapable of looking after her son represents psychological issues which are only later explored during the trial scene. Early on, the issue seems almost closed off when Ted asks ""How much courage does it take to walk out on your kid?"", but it is revisited when the pair is in court, reminding the audience that when families break up, the psychological consequences - as well as the legal ones - can be complicated.
The details of the custody case are - apparently - not entirely realistic. However, within the context of the narrative they work perfectly well, and the court scenes see Benton's screenplay casting a light on the ruthlessness of the legal processes involved in child custody battles: both Kramers seem shocked by the brutality of the questioning they receive in court. It's undoubtedly Robert Benton's best film as director, and as both director and writer (he based the screenplay on Avery Corman's novel of the same name) he really gets inside the characters' heads.
The acting helps of course. Dustin Hoffman - not atypically - gives an extremely impressive performance as Ted. He never fails to be convincing, regardless of the emotions Ted is exhibiting, and he's astonishing during scenes such as when Ted is frantically trying to get a job in 24 hours, creating an impression of barely restrained emotion. Meryl Streep is just as impressive as Joanna, making her far more sympathetic than she might have been, adding nuance to the plot. Mention must also be made of Justin Henry, who is very good as young Billy, giving a remarkably naturalistic performance especially considering his age.
Cinematographer Néstor Almendros makes great use of close-ups to focus on the actors' faces at key moments, and there are important details, such as Ted packing away Joanna's things as he starts to settle into his new role as a single father. Almendros was famous for his preference for natural - rather than studio - lighting, which helps the film's realistic look. When Billy falls and injures himself, the camera follows Ted as he runs through the city to the hospital with Billy in his arms, capturing the character's sense of panic. The soundtrack is credited to six different composers, one of whom is Antonio Vivaldi: it works really well too. The overall result is a thoughtful, worthy and above all impressive film that barely seems to have aged at all.",Kramer vs. Kramer
96,jayjaycee,Pioneering divorce drama,9,22 April 2020,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a 1979 drama directed by Robert Benton starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. Having watched ""Marathon Man"" recently got me in the mood to continue watching the other essential films of Dustin Hoffman and so I proceeded this undertaking by giving this highly critically acclaimed drama a shot. As I haven't expected it differently from a phenomenal cast like this one, the final outcome hits at the very correct spots. On the basis of Avery Corman's two years earlier published novel of the same name, director Benton took it and made the highly complicated conflict come to life with the indescribable power he got out of his two leading actors. Both Hoffman and Streep are the literal buttresses of this deeply affecting divorce drama. If my researches are correct it's also kind of revolutionary in its own way, as it questioned the gender roles in such cases and gave an insight into the emotional worlds of both fighting parties, the mother and the father. What else can I say with such extraordinary performers as the protagonists? Hoffman is once again incredible in his role and as I repeatedly expressed it on several occasions, the man is undoubtedly one of the best actors to have ever worked in Hollywood and his performance in here is nothing short of masterclass acting in its rawest form. Even though one might assume that he's outshining everyone else here, there comes Streep with her comparatively short but not less outstanding performance as the struggling ex-wife. There you have two gods of acting, giving equally breathtaking powerhouse performances, with a child actor also doing undeniably extraordinary work and the three alone could make this whole film worth the watch and yet it's by far not all this movie has to offer. Writer-director Benton managed to perfectly adapt the emotional conflict to a complex screenplay that knows how to mesmerize the audience. The film's basically divided into two parts: In the first half, advertisement manager Ted Kramer all suddenly has to deal with his son after his wife left him. What makes this first half stand out is how well his character develops, as he goes from an overwhelmed and struggling single parent who actually has not a single idea of how to deal with his son to a caring father who more and more gets to know his son while disregarding his well paid job for him progressively. It's a rollercoaster ride of a development, the more time they spent together the more their shared bond improves and they make the best of this situation, even if it's not always easy. Next to this, the chemistry between Hoffman and Henry is constantly truly genuine and some dialogue they share so painfully realistic. May it be Billy bursting out in tears and screaming for his mother or Ted trying to explain his son that it's not his fault that his mommy left him, it sent shivers down my spine, definitely. It's even more gut wrenching as most of the shots are close-ups that underline this fragile intimacy even more. As the wife returns out of nowhere, the even more crushing second half begins with the fight over custody as the main focus.
Just when you thought it couldn't become more heartbreaking the film concentrates on an unanswerable question: Where does a child of divorced parents belong? Even if the film tries to justify the motivations of Joanna Kramer to a certain degree, it's obvious that it rather sides with Ted and pushes Streep's character in a villain type of role. I don't know if some more objectivity would have suited the film better, but I the way it is, it tackles some sort of controversial topic: Is motherhood superior to fatherhood? During the film I felt deep sympathy for Ted and even though I know that he made mistakes in the past and is responsible for his wife's suffering in some way, I really can't deny that I heavily disliked Joanna and her behaviour. I mean, she leaves the family and distances herself from her responsibilities as a mother and deserts her son who needs her more than ever and simply disappears for what seems like forever, only to all suddenly show up after one and a half year and after he kind of got used to the situation that he's now alone with his father. On top of that, she even has the audacity to claim that it's her right to take him away from Ted after all the things she did? I'm sorry, but it's hard to not judge her. Even though the question of fault is not fully answerable, because her motivations make sense in a weird way, the tendency to declare her the guilty party is immensely higher. On one hand, who does she think she is, on the other hand we are aware what lead her to this terrible decision, but since it's not depicted on screen, the opportunity to emotionally comprehend it is prevented by it. Still, there's actually no winner and no loser when it comes to the question of who is the better parent. The whole court scene is actually nothing but a war that can't be won, still I was mad that she eventually won simply because she's the biological mother. That's another thing that makes this film somewhat controversial, as it heavily criticises the fact that such topics shouldn't be decided on the basis of sex. It's something that could only turn out horrendous, either way. All in all, this heartbreaking divorce drama is a pioneering entry into its respective subgenre, as it illuminates even the smallest detail of this complex and heavy theme. Even if it's a little biased, the film still offers enough arguments for both sides of this fight and brings the viewer in a moral dilemma as well. Lead by a powerful Hoffman and a phenomenal Streep (who both were awarded with an Oscar deservedly) the film knows how to cast a spell on the audience and give it a constant feeling of discomfort. It's a sensitively narrated and touching drama that gave a deep insight into a delicate topic that many people always have suffered from, but that was never made into a big thing. This film here showcased even the ugliest sides of it and as the pioneering and outstanding achievement in drama that it is, it's still a guideline for this genre. I'm pretty sure a film like ""Marriage Story"" wouldn't exist without this one here. A classic that definitely packs a punch. Simply superb.",Kramer vs. Kramer
97,ilpohirvonen,Little Moments of Intimate Truth Forty Years Ago,7,16 July 2019,"A woman's wistful face rests on her hand in darkness. It's pitch black around her, but her sympathetic face is lit up like that of an angel. Her eyes are a little wet, and she is looking down. ""I love you, Billy,"" she utters. A quiet, lethargic response from the off-screen space, ""I love you, mom,"" expands the space by sound before a cut to a larger shot scale does so by image. This little moment of intimate truth, the mother's truth, that of a lost woman played by then not yet even a star-on-the-rise Meryl Streep, is but one of many in this gem of a film called ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" (1979). The opening scene establishes a certain tone for the film, directed by then accomplished scriptwriter Robert Benton, it establishes a calm tone of realist minimalism, but it also sets up the film's concise exposition. It continues with a parallel cut that reveals the mother's husband, a young advertiser on the rise in his company, played by the then already established method actor of films such as ""The Graduate"" (1967), ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969), and ""All the President's Men"" (1976), Dustin Hoffman, walking away from work with his boss who is making big promises to him about the future. Arriving home, excited about the news of potential upcoming promotions, the man is met with his wife's impassioned words: ""I'm leaving you."" Not only does she leave him but also their 5-year-old son without giving any promises of return. Thus starts the development of a father-and-son relationship between the dad and his estranged son. Through trials and errors, ups and downs, they come together, get closer, and form a tight bond on broken ground. Their new found relationship is interrupted by the mother's unexpected return which drives them into a difficult custody battle.Sweeping the Academy Awards, winning all the biggest five Oscars, Benton's ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" never feels what many nowadays call an ""Oscar film."" While it speaks to us, while it still resonates poignantly with our innermost feelings, it comes from a different time in film history before there was such a thing as an ""Oscar film."" There's a cliched saying, ""they don't make them like they used to,"" which is often applied to films from the golden age of Hollywood, but there's a truth to it when used appropriately. In addition to the golden age of Hollywood from the late 30's to the early 50's, there was a second renaissance in American popular cinema. It took place from the late 60's to the late 70's, and it is known as New Hollywood. In many ways, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" embodies this decade of artistic transition. Alongside films such as Allen's ""Annie Hall"" (1977) and Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman"" (1978), Benton's film exemplifies a new cinematic realism in American film that had been fine grained enough and that had reached such a level of effortless sophistication that it was possible to just put actors in real spaces and let them go with it. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is often seen as some kind of a watershed moment as it depicts divorce and custody battles with a new sense of maturity and elegance, giving both parties an equal stand and refusing easy answers. Although the film is told primarily from the man's point of view, there is not a moment when the spectator could hate the mother after the brilliantly executed opening scene. While the film exemplifies changes that were taking place in western society during the second wave of feminism, it does this not by intention or force but due to its intuition that has been achieved by the New Hollywood aesthetics of realist minimalism. Sobriety is in its nature. It's funny to think that Francois Truffaut almost came to direct ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and how different -- no matter how fitting with Truffaut's own oeuvre in the late 70's -- the film would have been like. It owes its heart to Benton's touch and its homely feeling on familiar ground.Of equal importance, in this case, it must be stressed, are the performances by Hoffman, Streep, Jane Alexander as their mutual friend, and Justin Henry as Billy, who is still the youngest actor ever to receive an Oscar nomination for his performance. There's true power of emotional presence. Hoffman was in the middle of divorce even before production, and Streep had recently broken up with her boyfriend. There is improvisation and there is honesty. The first rewrite sessions of the script with Hoffman, Benton, and producer Stanley Jaffe have been described by Jaffe as group therapy. The method acting, Benton's minimalism, and new American realism all breathe freely from the film's audiovisual texture that feels and tastes like ordinary life. It's a little film, it's simple film, but its smallness and simplicity are something that is lacking in American popular cinema forty years since its premiere. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is full of these little moments of intimate truth that make you marvel. The father grabbing a hot frying pan in the middle of an unprecedentedly hectic morning, the son revolting by taking up ice cream from the freezer before finishing up his dinner, them shopping together, two divorced friends just talking on a park bench while their children are playing before them, a glass thrown against the wall in bitter anger, a hug that lingers between the father and his son, a terrified run through the streets, a quiet nod in court, a sigh, and an exchange of looks between the doors of an elevator. They ask to be enjoyed, they ask to be to be cherished and embraced as they are -- just because they are. Because they are real.",Kramer vs. Kramer
98,mnpollio,Absorbing and thoughtful drama with one glaring flaw,7,1 June 2011,"I usually do not much care for mundane cup-of-coffee dramas revolving around such realistic developments as custody trials or divorces or wills, but even I must admit to a good deal of success achieved by Kramer vs. Kramer.Dustin Hoffman is the male Kramer, a driven career man who is very much of the school that the man goes to work and concerns himself with bringing home the bacon, while the little lady sits at home and does the housework and rears the child. When his wife, played by Meryl Streep, decides this is too suffocating an existence for her, she bolts. This leaves Hoffman with the onus of balancing his work with trying to raise a young boy (Justin Henry) that he barely knows. Once the two bond in the absence of Streep, she returns to sue for custody of the boy and the film delves into a protracted court battle as to who would be the better parent.There is nothing especially surprising in Kramer vs. Kramer, but it is the execution that brings it together. Director Benton knows how to present everything in a matter-of-fact fashion with enough emotional impact to ring true with the viewer. And while the film maintains enough of an aloofness that fails to wring all of the drama out of the material it could, it certainly does engage the viewer and elicit our sympathy for the main characters.Hoffman is quite good in a no-nonsense performance as the man who evolves from driven career guy to loving father figure. Henry is solid, but I think granting him an Oscar nomination was pushing it. Ditto, Meryl Streep. I love Streep as an actress, but I think it is unfortunate that her two Oscars were awarded so early in her career before we really got to see the kind of range she was capable of. Her Oscar for this film is indeed puzzling as Joanna Kramer functions as little more than a plot device. She is included to cause the crisis that starts the melodrama and brings the father and son together, and then returns at an appropriate moment to cause crisis number two in the guise of the custody trial. Watching Streep in this film now, one is amazed that she comes off as so flat and emotionless - even in scenes with her son. This performance fails to hint at the kind of acting legend that she would deservedly become in a few years time and the Oscar thus seems wasted on her here. By contrast, Jane Alexander makes a much more believable contender as a concerned neighbor, who initially chides Hoffman for his selfishness before ultimately becoming one of his defenders. It is a very well done and nicely layered performance.The film also brings up the canard of a legal system that favors the mother over the father without any justification, but it fails to mention that there were/are many states that favor the father over the mother. As a child of divorce myself, I was consistently confounded by a Maryland legal system that constantly gave special treatment to a father who was a violent alcoholic, but seemed to feel that a mother who had none of those issues was second class. Yet KvK often fails to mention that there are places where the pendulum swings in the other direction and somehow makes it seem that only mothers get preferential treatment.Additionally, it becomes a bit annoying that the film wants to deify Hoffman for balancing work and child-rearing like it is some sort of impossible miracle, but fails to mention that there are tons of single parents, especially women, that were doing what he does in this film for years previously without any glorification whatsoever. Really, what choice did Hoffman's character have in light of the events? Much like the legal system it derides, the film often stacks the deck in favor of Hoffman's dad and barely averts making mom Streep into some kind of one-dimensional villain. The final moments of the film avoid such a development with a not entirely convincing about-face on the part of her character, but prior to that Mom is really little more than a forgotten contrivance who enters and exits the action based solely on how it will impact the central father/son pairing. There is something just a tad irritating about that.Yet even with that rather glaring flaw, it is impossible to deny that KvK does succeed in its modest goals thanks in large part to Benton's assured director, and heartfelt performances from Hoffman and Alexander.",Kramer vs. Kramer
99,v-56289,divorce,7,27 March 2021,The movie was good. I still however can not figure out my opinion on Mrs Kramer.. I think it could have been developed more. Also it was a little too slow (sometimes boring as we are used to too much action in current movies) and the quality is not the greatest.. but the movie is over 40 years old..,Kramer vs. Kramer
100,The_Wood,a relevant family drama 9/10,9,9 March 2002,"All though the subject matter might not be very intriguing, because it sounds so basic; Kramer vs. Kramer is a surprisingly solid film that deals with what it takes to be a parent.  The film is centered around Dustin Hoffman's dedication to his child -- and the sacrifices that need to be made.  It also deals with how divorce can confuse a child.  This film is not manipulative nor sappy, but just honest -- almost like it was a documentary. Whether or not it was worthy of Best Picture is an other question entirely.",Kramer vs. Kramer
101,eshwarmail,Familiar premise elevated by extraordinary performances,9,8 January 2017,"Reviewed October 2011Though it treads on a very familiar premise and stays predictable throughout, it is a movie that easily stands on it's own for it's terrific performances and a seamless screenplay filled with wonderful moments both joyous and otherwise. It is not for no reason this movie has catapulted two of the most critically successful actors of their generation. The story starts with an unhappy marriage between Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) & Joanne Kramer (Meryl Streep) that ends to Ted's surprise and finds himself as the lone caretaker of his son right when he has taken additional responsibility at work. He finds himself inadequate as a father and in profession even while giving his best. He gets fired eventually but makes peace with it due to his unwavering love for his son. Just when things are getting saturated, Joanne comes back for custody of her son. Rest of it is Kramer vs. Kramer in court and how it is taken care of in the most mature and audience pleasing way.The plot isn't as hard-hitting as other marriage-on-the rocks movies like 'Revolutionary Road' or 'Blue Valentine', but it adds another dimension to it for it's practicality than blind emotions. It has a tight script that connects with the audience so frequently with plenty of terrific moments and apt performances. Evaluating the lead's performances is a futile experiment here, since all know what they are capable of. They give one of their best. Enough said. Not to forget the kid, who is terrific and the one who binds all the threads in this plot. If you don't feel for him, there isn't anything much the leads could've done to satisfy on the emotional level. This isn't the first time I have watched this movie and definitely not the last. Mind you, I don't normally repeat. So this is kind of special.",Kramer vs. Kramer
102,antagonist117,"Benton's script is challenging, crowd-pleasing, and perfectly balanced",10,23 January 2014,"Robert Benton, a man from Texas whose previous screen writing credits include ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967) and ""Superman"" (1978), had a very different and difficult task to achieve when he adapted the screenplay for ""Kramer vs. Kramer."" This is a story that, to tell correctly, demands perfect balance. The movie can lean to one Kramer's perspective, alternately Hoffman's character or Streep's, but it can never consign the other to a mere antagonist role: each has to be completely sympathetic and redeemable even when they are at their lowest or potentially in the wrong. The equation becomes more complicated when role-reversal is involved. If Hoffman's Kramer is any more or less capable a caregiver to their 7 year-old than Streep's Kramer, or if hers is any more or less driven to succeed in business than his, the balance and the film's message of equality become compromised. At the same time, if they are too perfectly malleable as characters they cease to be true-to-life and therefore lose their relevance as tools of social commentary; their clearly-delineated roles—a dissatisfied wife and a career-driven husband—are what determine the kinds of challenges each face, and their respective arcs remain linked to these initial identities even as they subvert their usual meanings and transcend their presumed limitations. Toward the end, Benton indulges in some overwrought courtroom theatrics (""OBJECTION!"" ""Overruled!""), and the resolution of the story is ultimately a bit of a cop-out, but it can be argued that these decisions also point to his wisdom as a screenwriter inasmuch as the film's message had already been conveyed and all that was left was to leave the audience as happy and entertained as they were (hopefully) enlightened. Aspiring screenwriters may find much to admire and emulate in Benton's delicate, unflinching, yet broadly accessible achievement.",Kramer vs. Kramer
103,kurciasbezdalas,Very interesting and revealing film,10,11 December 2008,"I've seen many Dustin Hoffman's movies like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but his characters are much to often calm or even shy persons. I expected him to be in this movie the same as he was in Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this film and kinda reminded me of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end. I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son. This movie is also revealing. Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Streep plays a woman trapped in the traditional role of working wife and mother, who decides to leave the relationship--leaving her child with her husband. Later, in a change of heart, she seeks custody of the child and a court battle ensues.Though not quite a starring role, Streep has considerable screen time and presents a multi-faceted image of a woman attempting to come to terms with who she is and what she wants out of life. It's a moving performance and provocative film, that challenged the accepted strengths and weakness that men and women bring to parenting.

Justin Henry was eminent as little Billy.The most endearing quality of the film is the superb writing and direction by Robert Benton.

Most impressive where these non talking scenes with father and boy eating/cooking in the kitchen to show their close relationship (actually all ""eating/dining/cooking"" scenes that portray the relationship development in a creative way!). Would modern scripts be bold enough to make the decision to include those slow paced scenes today? love it.
I was not really in sync with Streep's role, as we do not get enough information on her emotional background and pre-story. So many of her actions felt a little off bc. for me the background was missing and I guess Streep cannot really fill that whole. Overall amazing performance in my view though.

Ted has absolutely no idea what to do or how to take care of Billy, since all he knows is work. However, as time passes, his fathering skills slowly blossom and the audience is escorted into watching the beautiful relationship a newly-divorced (and still adjusting) father has with his son.This was a well-done movie when it comes to what it wanted to portray. The actors were great and very fitting for the roles, the slow progression of the relationship between Ted and Billy was realistic, and all the emotions in the movie was conveyed to the audience brilliantly. I did not however feel like this one deserved a perfect score, even if it did touch me. Hm.While ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is not the best movie out there, I think that it is one of the best movies portraying child custody battles between parents. I think that anyone who watched this movie could see that what happened in this film was a hard and difficult process emotionally for both parties and the child.

They live in perfect harmony now. Then the mother reappears. She hasn't been present for almost a year and a half, and now she is wanting custody of this confused little boy.

The court system of today favors women over men again and again and again. This movie shows the disastrous and ridiculous effects of that. That's why it's such an important film.The cast really is brilliant here. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep both give Oscar-deserving and winning performances. Hoffman is exquisite as the struggling and loving father Ted. Ms. Streep gives a superb performance as the somewhat confused mother. You'll hate her sometimes and truly feel for her others, but she acts beautifully. The little boy, Justin Henry, is also excellent.Watch this movie. It won five Oscars and deserved them all.

The directing is face-paced, and no one at any time seems superficial in their roles. Anyone who has gone through, or is going through a divorce, or even a bad marriage, will find some great meaning and insight from this movie.The only drawback is Meryl Streep. I always believed that she was an over-rated actress. But in Kramer vs. Kramer, there is something missing from her character that I think creates an aloofness in the scenes that she is in. I could tell from her body language very early on in this movie that she had strong emotional problems. Throughout the film, she seems so quiet and unsure of herself that you begin to feel even MORE sensitivity for the real troubling issues facing Ted (Dustin) and Billy. (Justin) Their scenes together are SOOOO well done that you really see them as a father and son and not actors. There is also no sappiness or soap opera dialog to muddle this fine story.

It's all about ordinary people with our problems. What's different and catchy about Robert Benton's film-making was here we are not trying to put ourselves in the actors' shoes, the actors are trying to put themselves in our shoes.The story is about the Kramer family which is broken, father and mother are separated, and they have to fight for their son's custody in court against each other. After his wife walks out on him, Ted Kramer's life completely turns upside down. He has to take care of his son, Billy; but at the same time he's very busy with his position in an advertising company. Soon, he loses his job; Billy has an accident; his wife wants Billy to live with her. Against all the problems Ted is facing, he always fought with his heart. Ted's a very emotional and sensitive man, but a strong person at the same time.Ted Kramer character was a new model for Dustin Hoffman. But since the late 1950s' Elia Kazan's pioneer approach of modern drama making on film, with the basic instalment of the leading actor into a conflict, Ted Kramer's strong character raised Dustin Hoffman's acting to become a legend ; just like it did to Marlon Brando, Sylvester Stallone, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson with 1970s'.Something more about the movie; the linear cut has been 43 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Most of this cut has included Meryl Streep's deleted scenes. Also Meryl Streep has been originally cast in the role of Ted's one night stand, eventually played by second supporting actress Jobeth Williams. Meryl Streep's role as Joanna Kramer has been primarily offered to Kate Jackson; but due to her contract rules with the TV-series Charlie's Angels, she hasn't been able to accept this role. Joanna Kramer character has been designed to be the leading actress and subject to have more scenes, before director Benton making the last decision of the plot's focus point.Both Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman today have splendid fame on movie career, and Kramer vs. Kramer was an important milestone for both of their careers. Dustin Hoffman's Oscar speech winning the best actor at the 1979 Academy Awards ceremony is one of the best Oscar speeches of all Academy Awards history; like the movie Hoffman's Oscar speech is also available to watch on Youtube.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Joanna Kramer returns back after sometime and files a lawsuit to claim the responsibility of their child. Joanna wins the case on terms of motherhood but Ted wins the heart of Joanna as a caring father who would risk his career for his son. And as the saying goes ""they lived happily ever after"".It was easily the best performances Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep gave in their acting career.

I will never forget the kid falling off the jungle gym and that ""blank"" (pardon my french) Meryl Streep using it against Dustin Hoffman in court. I think it is great that the two stars from this movie are still relevant today more than 30 years later. This is a classic. I think what spoke to me most about this movie was how it mirrored in subtle and not so subtle tones the changing landscape in America that really gained momentum in the 1970's. How women are more than just the roles men assign them, how men can make caring fathers, that women can and sometimes should make more money than men, how not all marriages are going to last forever, and finally how that can affect a small child. I can't say for sure but because of those struggles not so long ago, I think kids today are better prepared for divorce today. Its all around them, and there are support systems both private and public. We learned a lot from struggles that seemingly occurred ages ago. That is what I liked about Kramer vs. Kramer, it made me think as well as entertain. I am not sure that was the purpose behind this Robert Benton creation, but I think just like movies such as ""inherit the wind"" paint a picture from another time in American History and how we have changed as a people since, this movie does that as well. In that sense it also shows how much we have not changed at our core.

118,madanmarwah,A memorable film of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep,8,24 July 2021,"I had seen "" Marriage story"" some days and I was disappointed with the director's handling of the plot about marital discord and the battle for child custody after the dissolution of marriage. I then remembered a film of yester years called "" Kramer vs Kramer "" which dealt with the subject in a sensitive and touching manner. I saw this first rate film made memorable by the acting of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep in the main roles. The film opens with Meryl informing her husband Dustin one night at home that she is leaving him as she has suffered years of neglect. Life collapses for Dustin and he desperately struggles to hold on to his job and look after his 5 year old son. There are quite a few touching scenes of father son bonding in the kitchen/ bedroom. Dustin making French toast for his kid is a scene worth watching. Similarly the kid's midnight encounter in the corridor at home with Dustin's lady guest remains amusing. Without getting unduly loud the director shows the agony of Father, mother and child. The courtroom scenes are realistic and the melodrama is kept under control. Both Dustin and Meryl turn in excellent performances and this remains a strong point of the film. The film remains topical even today.",Kramer vs. Kramer
119,Willie-12,Powerful Drama With Exceptional Acting,8,29 March 2011,"Recently I've decided to watch what are considered to be some of the best movies ever made that, for whatever reason, I've never seen before. The first movie on my list was Kramer vs. Kramer. And I wasn't disappointed. This is a powerful film with some of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. There have been some that have suggested that because this movie is dated a bit (go figure...as time goes on movies get older) it's lost some of its luster. However, I think that the fact KVK is over thirty years old actually makes it more compelling and intriguing, not less. This was the time of no cell phones, no texting, no personal computers (for the most part), no email, and no social networking sites. When one didn't have custody of their child it was letters and land line phone calls only when the child was with the other parent. When you take that into consideration, it makes the film all the more powerful as far as I'm concerned. And the acting, as has already been mentioned, was phenomenal. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep give everything they have to their performances, and thus portray their characters in such realistic fashion that it wasn't difficult for me at all to imagine that these were real people living in the real world. And I liked the fact that the makers of the film showed no bias towards either Kramer. They were both very vulnerable and imperfect people who loved their son very much. Some might think that the conclusion of the film was a cop out and that's understandable. The ""happy"" ending did feel a bit out of place for a film that was otherwise pretty somber. However, if one thinks about it, it wasn't really a happy ending. At least not in the conventional sense. Despite the fact that Meryl Streep's character decides not to take custody of the boy after she wins in court, there is still a road behind the Kramers (and, no doubt in front of as well) that is littered with heartbreak and sorrow. A mother who won't get to be with her son as much as she wants to be. A father who will still have to raise his son in the absence of a mother. And a boy who is caught in between.",Kramer vs. Kramer
120,ijonesiii,You Don't Divorce Your Kids...,9,3 December 2005,"KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years, walks out on him, leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton's incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. For instance, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she's leaving him, she doesn't just storm out the door...she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim...it was thought about and Joanna felt, with no other option than to leave, if she was leaving she was going to do it properly...and with no specific plan in mind, she did not think it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who doesn't know why his mom is gone and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film's conclusion. This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too...Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream...Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party...Billy catching his dad's one night stand (JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom stark naked, but it's the moments of human drama you remember...Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym...Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper...""Shame on you."" And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind? But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast. A must-see.",Kramer vs. Kramer
121,BoomerDT,40 years later...still underwhelmed,6,2 September 2020,"This was my first movie date with a lovely lady who became my wife. I really wasn't that impressed with KVK in 1980, last night we again viewed it on Prime. Once again, same reaction. A pair of great actors, Hoffman and Streep (who cries a lot, as always) and good supporting performances by Jane Alexander and Howard Duff. It's hard to feel any sympathy for Streep's character-I believe an alternative to walking on her spouse and son would to have given an ultimatum to Mr. K-either let me go back to work or I'm gone. In fact the two of them could have saved a bundle on attorney fees by either going to counseling or mutually agreeing to a shared custodial arrangement. But then we wouldn't have much of a movie, would we? In any case, the ending leaves you wondering why the two of them, especially Mrs K, couldn't come to this solution earlier. No way in the world this should have cleaned up at The Oscars. Then again there have been a number of pedestrian films that have been honored.",Kramer vs. Kramer
122,MovieLuvaMatt,Extremely powerful with one of Hoffman's best performances,9,5 February 2004,"I was thoroughly moved by this powerful motion picture that doesn't seem to contain a single weak moment.  Though there are a couple of films from the 70's that I regard as great, and this will be added to the list now that I finally got to see it, in general films of that decade had the tendency to be slow and boring.  I didn't feel the same way about ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" at all.  It does a terrific job at showing how much the divorce of two parents can really hurt a child, as well as the value of spending time with a child and not putting things like work as a top priority.  Dustin Hoffman's character is sympathetic, but flawed, and that's what I liked so much about him.  He isn't written as a caricature, but like a real father in that type of situation.  You're able to sympathize both with his willingness to keep his job, and the child's willingness to spend time with him.  Nowadays, divorce is such a common thing that it doesn't even seem to be a big issue anymore.  Thousands of children end up in the same situation as Billy (Justin Henry).  But that doesn't mean we have to take things like that for granted.  It must be extremely difficult for a child to find out one day that mommy or daddy can no longer be there for him or her.  Though Meryl Streep is only on screen for about 30 minutes, she does a terrific job as well.  Even though I didn't sympathize with her deserting her child out of the blue like that, I was able to understand her feelings that conflicted between her love for her son and the overwhelming responsibility of having to be there for him 24/7.  Both Hoffman and Streep deserved their Oscars.  I don't think Hoffman has ever given a performance that was less than excellent, but his portrayal of Ted Kramer definitely ranks up there as one of his best.  It's such a multi-dimensional character and he pulls it off with flying colors.  Next to his performance in ""Rainman,"" I have to say this is his best work.  And even Justin Henry was wonderful.  His chemistry with Hoffman seemed perfectly natural, and my guess is they spend a lot of time bonding off-camera.  I always have a theory that whenever a film contains a child as one of the main characters, and it's not some dorky family movie, it usually turns out either good or great.  My theory certainly works in this case.  Just as a little side note, I find it funny when I compare the MPAA now to how they were 20-30 years ago.  The film has a PG rating and it contains a full-length scene where a woman is not only naked, but she's naked in front of a child.  Nowadays, that would be too racy for a PG-13.  But it's good that it received a PG, because this is a film that parents should watch with their children. My score:  9 (out of 10)",Kramer vs. Kramer
123,Chuck-149,"A very good movie but essentially thanks to the master, Dustin Hoffman.",8,8 September 1999,"What's very good about this movie is that it has a little bit of comedy thrown in with a tearjerking drama.  However, this isn't one of those movies that rank in a class above others.  ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a very good movie that could be placed in the ""good movie"" class.  But if anyone is to say that it's excellent, it's natural that they would say that for Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance  Hoffman is Ted Kramer and Meryl Streep is his wife.  The movie begins in the middle of the night.  Meryl Streep walks into her son's room as he sleeps and wakes him up to tell him goodbye.  We automatically guess that she is going to leave her husband and her son.  The only problem is that Ted doesn't much time with his son so he doesn't know what he likes and hates. And so begins Ted's true discovery of his love for his son.  However,  his wife comes back after a while and asks Ted to be allowed to have the boy back for a short while.  After his refusal, Meryl Streep takes Hoffman to court demanding custody of the child.  The end of the movie is probably the best part of it.  The trial scenes are excellent and the ending is one of the sweetest saddest and yet happy endings ever.  The best scene of the movie has got to be the ice cream scene.  If you're going to watch this movie, watch it for Hoffman's and Streep's performances mainly.",Kramer vs. Kramer

125,Wilbur-10,"It's very good, but didn't quite deserve the Oscar sweep which it received.",9,9 May 2003,"A virtually flawless drama concerning marriage break-up and the ensuing custody battle. Don't be put off by the storyline - the film has quality stamped all over it, and anybody with an appreciation for the cinema will lap it up. I'm a B Movie horror & sci-fi fan, but 'Kramer vs Kramer' is still in my Top 50 films of all time list.I'm sure everyone is familiar with the plot, so I won't go over old ground. Needless to say that Dustin Hoffman is excellent, but is matched by Justin Henry who really does give a performance by an 8 year old which is Oscar worthy (he was nominated for Supporting Actor but didn't win). Meryl Streep is fine in a difficult role which is bound to elicit little sympathy from the audience - fortunately her part becomes more secondary as the storyline develops.There's little else to say really - the classical music score is spot-on, the film forces you to cry without resorting to crass tear-jerking sentimentality and the ending works, despite being a bit implausible. A fine film to round off the best decade of cinema. The only real grumble I have is that 'Kramer vs Kramer' was used by the 'powers-that-be' to make a point and dampen down the fire which the new wave of young, radical directors were stirring. The film was rushed out by Columbia to qualify for the 1979 Academy Awards and compete against 'Apocalypse Now'. As top notch as 'Kramer vs Kramer' is, the Best Film Oscar it won should have rightfully gone to Coppola's Vietnam epic.BEST SCENE - the French Toast breakfast fiasco.",Kramer vs. Kramer
126,DVR_Brale,Seriousness and playfulness that will always be relevant,9,1 August 2017,"Kramer vs. Kramer (KvK) is the only movie which kept me sad from the beginning to the very end. It's a sad story which includes all repercussions divorce brings along. This movie highlights what husband, wife and children have to bear in such a case.Not everything is always so gloomy. That's why KvK contains comedic elements made with great care: those never steer away from the main point but rather contribute to movie's realism. Since the main focus is father-child relationship, getting rid of comedic elements would undoubtedly make the drama feel more feigned. This just is what people go through when divorcing. And that's where the quality of this movie lies: nothing feels flamboyant or made in a way to suit a certain ideology. We see how father and son deepen their relationship but we see a lot of low punches between adults as effect of lack of communication and sincerity. Anyone who talks about divorce with ease should watch this movie.Almost thirty years later, when divorce rates seem to go higher then ever before, western world is in need for such a movie. It's sincerity, seriousness, playfulness and masterful acting are, I'm sure, always going to be appreciated and relevant.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Along the way he must learn to be a ""mother"" to his son, as well as father and to keep his career on track.Meryl Streep, just emerging as a major star in this film is excellent as the wife and little Justin Henry as the son caught in the middle brings a tear or two to the viewer's eye.Also giving excellent performances are Jane Alexander as the neighbor who befriends Hoffman and veteran Howard Duff as Hoffman's attorney.Don't miss the scene where Hoffman's girlfriend, played by Jobeth Williams (in the buff) is met on the way to the bathroom by Justin Henry.",Kramer vs. Kramer
128,Sanou_san,Exceptionally touching,10,5 March 2008,"Certainly when I saw this movie at HBO, I was bit erratic in following the plot, but it catches my attention when seeing Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly I'm not enthralled watching old movies, but then in the long run it changes my point of view. Seeing this stirring film made me experience once again couching at my seat not noticing my tears suddenly roll down my cheek, and then after, let loose a heavy sigh in realizing the impact of what I've just witness. Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I've witnessed for a long time that even I, myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional, but is not saturated with such. The characters weren't unrealistic for their roles; they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film, like the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding, I can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different, then performed it well. Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times, when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it, catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.",Kramer vs. Kramer
129,jillbeckinheim7,Powerful film about the horrors of divorce,7,29 October 2021,"Powerful film about the horrors of divorce. Christ warned about this. Divorce kills.Dustin Hoffman shines as Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man having to juggle at least three different challenges in life: jilted husband, workaholic ad executive and loving father. Meryl Streep as Joanna Kramer was less central to the movie simply because Joanna was absent for a good part of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for his money. The true standout, though, (in my opinion) had to be young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital breakdown, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely believable in this role as he deals with the conflicting emotions around his mother and his adjustment to life with Dad, only then to have the confusion around why he should have to leave his Dad when it was his Mom who walked out on him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a beat in this very difficult role.All in all, this is an excellent, Oscar-worthy movie whose only weak point was what I thought to be a truly disappointing decision to go for the sappy and happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here.",Kramer vs. Kramer

This is a very common story, that I saw in many movies before. Everything important happens in the last few minutes of the movie. The subject develops very slowly and somehow makes me bored.But the best thing in this film is little Kramer. His play is wonderful indeed. He is very natural.The rest is quite normal, but anyway, I rewarded the film with 6 points.",Kramer vs. Kramer
131,severindringel,a sympathetic character study that touches on important subjects,8,14 March 2021,"Ted Kramer is a New York advertising salesman who is on fire for his job and has just received a lucrative promotion. He rushes home to celebrate the good news with his wife Joanna. However, he is caught cold by her when she announces that she is leaving him and does not show up for months. Ted eventually has to learn to make his five-year-old son Billy the priority in his life, which has a negative effect on his professional ambitions. When Joanna suddenly returns and sues for custody of their son, the former couple end up in a bitter court battle.Dustin Hoffman had already underpinned his status as a high-profile method actor well before Kramer vs. Kramer. The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy or Lenny are just a handful of examples of his high-profile roles to date. With Ted Kramer, Hoffman plays a much more grounded character who, as a workaholic, even recalls the cliché of the male image of the time. As soon as he realises that he and his son are on their own, he takes us on a sympathetic character study in which he becomes more empathetic and understanding towards Billy from scene to scene. His few scenes with his ex-wife Joanna, played by a superb Meryl Streep, are marked by mutual respect and fears of loss regarding their son. Streep plays the vulnerable and insecure Joanna with a great deal of emotion and the necessary depth to make her character endearing despite the abrupt abandonment of Billy. She manages to steer viewers to her side even though Hoffman is the real protagonist of the film. Justin Henry gives a highly mature performance for his age in the role of Billy. The back and forth between his parents varies almost by the minute, but without becoming exhausting. Also worthy of mention is Jane Alexander as Margaret, who grows closer to Ted after Joana's departure, whereupon the two form an unexpectedly close and authentic friendship.Director Robert Benton has succeeded above all in taking a neutral and unbiased stance towards the two parties in Kramer vs. Kramer. This is particularly evident in the courtroom scenes in the third act. The big exposures are absent, there is similar fairness from both the male and female perspectives. This may sound as if Benton does not dare to go below the surface, but exactly the opposite is the case. Through the simple structure, he makes reference to the then emerging discussions about gender roles, the status of men and women and many other social phenomena such as work-life balance or custody. Divorce and power struggles over children can be messy, it even is here to some extent, but overall Kramer vs. Kramer feels very real and is not uncomfortable at any point. The ending may be a bit convoluted and doesn't seem compellingly logical, but that doesn't change the fact that Kramer vs. Kramer is a simple, rock-solid film that you take to your heart with all its transparency and closeness.",Kramer vs. Kramer
132,sildarmillion,40 Years Later...,10,24 December 2020,"... I can see why this movie won an Oscar.This movie came out a good 10 years before I was even born. Now, 40 years later, at once it's incredible how much things have changed.This movie is about a custody battle over a seven 7-year old child by divorced parents. The movie is incredible because of the thorough job is does exploring the issues around the divorce and the custody battle, and it is so rare that we see characters engage in such honest retrospection in films.In 2020, what was amazing to watch was how unaccommodating society (especially the workplace) seemed to be of single fathers. Mr. Kramer's boss seemed to have the attitude that ""You're supposed to have a wife who maintains everything at home so that you can focus on work."" He showed so little compassion for the fact that Kramer really needed to prioritize his son. I wonder if he would have bene the same way if Kamer's wife had died rather than having left. Maybe he would have been more outwardly sympathetic, but the consequences may have been the same.In some ways, the movie does feel dated, but in others, I thought it was good to be able to look through a window to the past and see how far we've come, even if we still have a long way left to go.",Kramer vs. Kramer
133,Essay-Kun,MARRIAGE,10,23 July 2021,"Kramer V Kramer has to be the epitome of a marital relationship gone wrong and the productive outcome and self-realizations about Marriage.The movie starts with Ted, the husband being too career-oriented and focusing on the path to promotion as he closes down a huge account for a firm he works for.And Joanne, the wife who has shown to be suffering and self-loathing towards life, that she's lost control of everything and she leaves the home.~ For a day or two, it takes ted to realize she ain't coming back.For the first time, he handles the pressure of parenting and things don't really look in a good stance.Fast forward he's shown to struggle at the firm but he never leaves his child's side.He changes his priority to the only family he has.For which he's warned by his boss that if this ain't working he's not gonna be in the business too long.~ Ted and Joanne's friend Margrett is shown as an already divorced woman who is going through the rough patch and the consequences post-divorce.She has a good friendship with both of them and comes to help Ted with his son Billy sometimes whether it's at the park or home.Quite a beautiful relationship.~ For the third part, Joanne is shown to have come back after figuring out things after 1.5 years and demands the custody of her son to which Ted is baffled.The thing which irked me the most was she didn't care to show why she asked for it, for most of it was straight away fact that she wanted billy.They go to court and as you know the lawyers make it dirty with the framing of issues while examing both the parents.It's a lovely revelation, that both the parents recognize their shortcomings and accepted without being selfish and egoist their flaws for which they were responsible.The courtroom drama was awesome, both the lawyers had a great impact on the questions they chose to ask and represent, the corners they took and the slam they hit.Obviously in the end motherhood precedes which is eventually the right decision, but this is where the movie has 3 morales right there :1. Miscommunications is the major reason for the falling of any relationship.People forget or tend to ignore the communication to such an extent that things become complicated, they no longer have confidence in themselves, which leads to misunderstanding and quarrels and finally divorce.2. A woman's ambition, today it's a different story altogether, but yeah it exists.The ambitions of a woman and the compromise she makes to complete and settle down with someone.Coz it's the woman who completes the family.She's the care holder of the house. She's the one who looks after it.And often woman finds themselves in such a situation where the hollowness and emptiness eat them from the inside.For sure this can be avoided through means of communication and care, but it was already too late in this scenario.I can understand the fact but still leaving a child especially in his prime childhood can definitely create a scar in his life.It's in no way justified but circumstances can put any person in any situation.In that sense it's not about what's right or what's wrong, it's about what needs to be done.3. That a father can't be a great single-sex parent.Ted in this movie has done everything that a father would do and this movie also tries to fight against the generalization that men can't be good parents.All in all, it is such a wonderful experience to watch this movie.I loved it.Deserves the oscar.PS: No questions and comments on the acting, the screenplay, the dialogues and the cinematography coz it's perfect, I wouldn't change a damn thing about this movie.

135,aidosh94,Easy Oscars?,9,28 October 2007,"I think not! I mean yeah if you compare this film to The Godfather, or maybe a little older film like Casablanca, or maybe even a little newer film like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie, or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films (you should never do that) which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us, once again, one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors, in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help it, I think she's great). Meryl Streep, even though she's in a supporting role, is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age, his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful, so I say good job to cute little Justin Henry. While I was watching this film for like the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed, cause I haven't seen any of them, but from what I've heard, Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this film deserved it's five Oscars, and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future, just like it has for the past 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.Thanks for your time.",Kramer vs. Kramer

That message is basically that if we are all a little more understanding of people's differences, then we can all get along a lot better. The film shows a father being thrust into an unorthodox family unit - just him and his seven year old son. It shows him doing a good job too and benefiting from the experience. It shows that as much as we try to live in conventional family units, sometimes that is not possible. And that we should sometimes show people living outside the norm as heroes. SPOILER The reconciliation at the end between the mother and dad also encourages us to understand and listen to others more.

It happens suddenly to the husband Ted, but we later know it happens not suddenly to her. Being left with his son, workaholic Ted has to take care of his son by himself.Dustin Hoffman plays Ted. Ted has been obsessed with his job as an advertising art director, and he is the type of man who believes his hard work alone makes his family happy. He even doesn't know what grade his son is in. He is clumsy when he deals with his son, which is comical, but he certainly loves his son.The film goes in a very fast, brisk tempo, which reflects how busy Ted is. It also prevents the film from going too depressing. Most scenes have no music, which gives scenes tension and makes the acting stand out.Justin Henry as Billy, their son, is another excellent actor. He is a very real seven-year-old boy. The interaction between Ted and Billy is funny and lovely. Billy sometimes becomes sullen because he misses his mom, but learns his demand for mom only makes dad worried.In the latter half of the film goes on a legal battle between Ted and Joanna over custody of Billy. At the court, the former wife and husband express their emotions at each other which they never did when there were married. Meryl Streep as Joanna plays her dilemma between being a mother and being ""a whole human being"".What lies there is a historical background. It was in the 70s, when roles of fathers and mothers, or more generally men and women, were changing drastically. How do you balance your career and parenting? This issue is thoughtfully examined in this film from both a man's and a woman's view.",Kramer vs. Kramer
141,andy-933-696608,Kramer Vs. Kramer review,9,14 January 2011,"The films themes are both very common, very believable despite some being very morally contradicting. Its obvious most children prefer to be with their mothers rather than their fathers, mainly because since the mother applies the more nurturing and more comforting form of parental expression. I'm not saying that Fathers can't have the skills to properly raise a child, Hell I believe sex shouldn't be an issue at all. In this well directed, and no doubt tremendously orchestrated film adapt ion of the novel, Dustin Hoffman as Ted Kramer, proves with both determination, and surprising persistence that the love he has for his son Billy (Henry), playing both Mommy and Daddy at the wake of marital abandonment. Joanna Kramer (Streep) like any mother, faces the questionable doubt of her abilities to properly raise her child, resulting in her retreat from parenthood, leaving her son and husband. She can't be characterized as an irresponsible parent, but more insecure than others, leaving her child of neither selfish, nor irresponsible judgment, but rather the knowledge of her flaws, thus causing her to run away from further expressing those flaws. She gives Ted the typical nonjudgmental answers of ""its not you its me"". She was right. Just by observing her physical expressions during the films introduction, we can see she is sort of disturbed, and very depressed, battling some sort of gripping demons. Lets not call her nutty, just not complete at the moment. You'd think a guy as committed to his work, and his outside life as creative art director, Ted would have very little to bring to the table. The truth is he did at first. But in the course of the films slightly determinable time span, the very clear and meaningful efforts he makes to raise his son, prove just how good of a father he is. He teaches the kid to ride a bike. He has breakfast, and dinner with kid, conversing humorously with him as they make it together, and he ran to the hospital, like a madman at the very sight of seeing his kid injured. In the course of his journey of ascending to true parenthood, of which he lacked in the beginning, probably in the views of Joanna's close friend Margaret (Alexander), Ted's life becomes more and more complicated, as his responsibilities with raising a child on his own, conflict with the opinions of his superiors at work. In the 15 months since his wife left him, Kramer's performance at work has given less confidence to his boss John Shaunessy (Duff) and more incentive for his termination, with a little sense of respect. The whole taking them out to lunch, and then firing them method, seems both lacking in any respect and dignity for both parties, posing a big problem for Ted, because Joanna is back and wants Billy. I definitely thought of Joanna as a complete hypocrite. It was nice that she actually got herself some therapy, and worked out her issues, only to reclaim her son like a shamelessly depressing excuse for a parent. In the wake of her return, the film's title ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" becomes real, as the 2 parents battle out in court, and with the tension of knowing in the end, whoever loses, the result could be devastating to Billy. The Lawyers for each party were pretty vicious as well, each launching a barrage of tough and almost infuriating questions. On one side we Ted's lawyer asking Joanna questions referring to her general mother hood, as well as her motivations for leaving in the first place. On the other side, we have Joanna's lawyer questioning, Ted's old, and even his currently small, but well manipulated flaws to his advantage. I'm sure plenty of viewers felt relived when Ted's selfless determination to keep his child got him a good job just in time for court, only for the hopes of Billy and Ted being together to be shot down at the mercy of Joanna's higher salary. When all is said and done, the case result's becomes obvious, and the judge goes for the typical motherhood BS I brought up earlier. To even my surprise, Joanna's conscience causes a change of heart, to give full custody to her ex. Despite the films touching message, and reasonable direction, Streep's opposing character having a hypocritical motivation of fighting for her son, one cannot but be amazed by her performance, and how it just captures the very insecurities, and her self doubts as a mother. You can just see it in the way she speaks so shy and nervous towards anyone. Hoffman on the other hand, captures his character with plain and simple, but still very inspirational moral responsibility. In the course of the film, he was father with general love with his child, and when placed in the position of being both parents to Billy, his understanding of his son's love for his mother pushed him to try harder. His character development was very basic, but believable, which it should be. I myself have been raised by a great mother who has had to play both parts. The film's direction doesn't over dramatize Hoffman's development from a workaholic bread winner to workaholic/ loving father. Billy in general, was reason enough for his improvement. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" displays more than just a courtroom battle for a child, as it also sends a message of what is truly right for a child, and that the sex of the parent doesn't matter. All the matters is the concept of love, and the actions that parent, mother or father, takes to show that child.",Kramer vs. Kramer
142,silva-w-pius,Acting at its finest,8,4 January 2014,"Sport constantly speaks of legendary match ups, each claiming its own to be the most intense and exciting of all; Football has Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, Cricket has England vs. Australia, and not to be outdone, Tennis speaks highly of Nadal Vs Federra. But with 5 Oscars between them, Dustin Hoffmann vs. Meryl Strep for me it is the greatest match-up of them all.It was a cold winter's morning on what was the eve of the eve of Christmas, rather bored with the usual TV Christmas offerings, especially after seeing Wizard of OZ and It's a Wonderful Life for the billionth year running. I fancied a change so I decided to rent a DVD from the library. Upon arriving I was surprised to find that it was just about to close earlier than usual on account of Christmas, but as I was just about to turn around and walk back home, suddenly just pass the right shoulder of the rather pretty 20 something librarian (not at all like the stereotype) a golden halo engulfed a particular film on the top row, Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, and slowly like a mouth attracted to a flame, I was sucked in. So after using my award winning charm to convince the librarian to let me in for a couple of seconds just to burrow the film, I returned home with the DVD. Then all most like a scene from a Harry Potter, it practically flew out of my arms, straight into my computer and begin playing almost by magic. What follows was an unforgettable whirlwind of a roller coaster of emotions and a sublime demonstration of actors at their very prime, who had visibly spent all most of their lives carefully developing their craft, dedicating themselves to the work and doing the best with their natural talents. Making for one of the best ensemble performances I have seen in a very long while. A screenplay written and directed by Robert Benton, based on the novel by Avery Corman centre's on the turbulent first couple of years experienced by a high flying advertising exec Dustin Hoffman, who upon receiving the greatest boost to his career yet, simultaneously has his world turned upside down, when his a wife Meryl Streep decides to walk out on me, leaving him in sole care of their 5 year old son. At first the Hoffman character finds it difficult to manage a career and a small child, which eventually means he gets fired, but soon with the help of Margaret (Jane Alexander) a friend of his wife's help, he becomes better accustomed with the father role, which turns out that he is actually quite good at. But just when his relationship with the boy grows increasingly stronger, the mother returns 18 months later and drops another bombshell on him as well as myself, when she files for exclusive custody. What follows is a long painful struggle for a boy they both deeply care about and love. The film itself earned Robert Benton an Oscar for Best Director and Adapted screenplay, but his existence and triumph. From a technical perspective, the film was near perfect never a note out of place. But rightly or wrongly he is almost completely sidetracked by the mammoth performance of the two leads Dustin and Meryl. Although retrospectively looking back it shouldn't have been of much a surprise when you take into account both actors film CV's. With 5 Oscars between them, both are very impressive, just Dustin alone (Aka the king of the 70's) has appeared in a whole host of critically acclaimed masterpieces, among them are; Midnight Cowboy (My personal favourite) Rain Man (his Oscar winner) and Straw Dogs (His most underrated film). Then you have Meryl with; Deer Hunter (My favourite war film), Out of Africa (my favourite Meryl performance outside of Kramer vs. Kramer) and Sophie's Choice. What I loved most about her performance here was her ability to draw empathy from the audience, even when her characters actions in the hands of another actress, would make her extremely unlikable person. Yet Meryl even from the start when we see her in the close up, with all the love and affection in her eyes as she looks down to her child, you can tell the decision to leave was extremely difficult, even brave. While Dustin also showcased a controlled performance, in a place where less experience actors would have overdone it, with the Oscars in mind, Dustin's only focus was to portray such a complex character as honestly as he could, and do the source material justice, but most importantly he gave a very giving performance to anyone with the pleasure of sharing the screen with him, allowing himself as well as them to shine. Kramer vs. Kramer is a stunning demonstration of fine acting talent, and would serve any aspiring young actor or actress as a seminal manual in the acting craft at its very best.",Kramer vs. Kramer
143,sharkey197,A surprising class winner,10,23 August 2009,"I decided to show this film to my critical viewing class in the unit that deals with social changes and gender roles. I was a little apprehensive because it's a small film, with almost all dialogue and this goes against the grain of what these kids are used to. But since I'd always wanted to show a Meryl Streep film as well, it seemed like a good risk.To my complete amazement, the class LOVED it! It was only later during discussion that I realized they could relate to it because of the divorce and how it effects kids. So many of them had similar situations, including the kid who shared that his mother hadn't wanted him either, and that's why he lived with his dad (gulp!). Nobody complained that there were no special effects or violence--they were totally into the story.One unexpected side effect--they loathed Meryl Streep. Of course, it was the character they were reacting to, but it was very surprising that they were so emotionally invested they really had trouble separating the actress from her performance. I found out that most of them didn't really know her work--except for the Devil Wears Prada--and felt vaguely guilty that I'd turned off a generation to this magnificent actress. So I slipped in an extra film for fun and showed The River Wild. I wanted them to see her in a more heroic vein. Most of them liked the film very much and were able to comment on the broad contrast.Sometimes teens really surprise you. I really thought they might hate it. Instead, it's a definite film for next year.",Kramer vs. Kramer
144,nnwahler,"....was one of my big faves, at least at one time",10,9 April 2017,"Time was, 35 years ago, when I rated this as my third-favorite movie of all time. I'd watched it a total of three times, thought Hoffman's performance was the greatest, and much later bought a Beta copy of it. Of course, in '79 I'd seen very, very few movies then; I'd be familiarized with the historical classics in a film class several months later.I watched that Beta tape once, and never felt a need to see it again. And it's rather astonishing how far down this critically hailed film's reputation has gone. For its time, it marked the emergence of a new male image: the non-macho man of the 80s who feels free to display some normally female traits, like sensitivity and shopping and seeing his child to and from school safely. As well as trials and tribulations of single parenthood. Well, that redefinition of masculinity almost immediately went out the window with the election of a new president. Testosterone and T-bone steaks still reigned supreme, and the epithet ""wimp"" came back stronger than ever.I still remember my second viewing of this movie, just shortly out of the theaters and available to the 16-millimeter student cinema groups at universities everywhere. The audience was booing and hissing Streep's character when she came back to claim hers and Hoffman's child, and particularly during the climactic courtroom scene. They saw her as the heavy who just up and abandoned her family. Not that I found this especially revolting, but this viewing experience was unanticipated.I saw it again just two weeks ago with my folks; my father tuned it in about a quarter of the way into the film. It still flowed beautifully right through to the end, and it seemed an utterly magnificent three-fourth's of a movie. I'd love to watch it again, complete of course; just not right now.",Kramer vs. Kramer

However, the representation of Mr. and Mrs. Kramer is deeply problematic. The film does not even give Joanna a single chance to win audience sympathy. With all the father-son bonding scenes that populate the film, the film is quite openly biased in favour of the husband. It is never elaborated what the husband might have done to drive Joanna over the edge. The narrative seeks sympathy for Mr. Kramer and the child who have been 'abandoned' by the 'heartless' woman.

Instead of a review, let me add a few random thoughts.First and foremost, as opposed to some other reviewers, I liked Meryl Streep's performance. Hers was s small role and the role itself was not perfectly written but, as far as I can judge, she did the best she could.On the other hand, at least in the beginning of the movie, not only that Dustin Hoffman's character was deeply flawed but he himself overplayed it. In particular, the first breakfast scene was ridiculous. I would certainly never hire a person as sloppy, as disorganized, and as incompetent as his character was. Luckily both Mr. Hoffman and his character improved as the movie went on.Here is a question to the readers who lived on Manhattan in the late 1970s. Was it then possible to rent an apartment with at least 2 bedrooms with a 30K income? This is what both parents did.Was I the only one who was annoyed by the constant product placements in the movie? I don't recall seeing any other movie with such a product placement galore.Also, why was everyone constantly drinking some booze?Jane Alexander was great!The ending was, well, it was a typical Hollywood ending. I read in Wikipedia that there were plans to invite François Truffaut to direct the movie. It would be interesting to speculate if he would have agreed to such a compromise.The bottom line is that it's worth seeing the movie. I did at least 3 times. First in 1979 and now, 40 years later, I did it again.",Kramer vs. Kramer

There are aspects of each parent that drives the audience to feel convinced or uncertain about what the final fate of Billy Kramer should be. Ted is given a generous character arc that brings him from caring but work-engrossed father to exemplary dad. Joanna leaves in what seems to be poor taste but does seem to return in a much healthier light. The film is a reminder that marriages don't always last but the tenderness of the family unit can stay strong with a child. Performances are strong all around; I'd even be willing to offer my hot take is that Jane Alexander should have beaten out Meryl Streep. I give Kramer v Kramer an 8/10.",Kramer vs. Kramer

It touched both the emotions and the intellect. Due especially to the incredible performance of seven year old Justin Henry and a script that was sympathetic to each character (and each one's predicament), the thought provoking elements linger long after the tear jerking ones are over. Overall, superior acting from a solid cast, excellent directing, and a very powerful script.

155,critical-escapist,"The classic of the divorce genre, but fails to meet my expectations.",5,23 March 2006,"Kramer vs. Kramer, the film that became an instant film-classic in the genre of family divorces strikes a chord with me. I have experienced the circumstances of divorce is my life and I was really hoping that the film would give divorce some justice. The story is quite simple in this matter: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is a man who puts his career before his family. One day his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaves him and also leaves her child Billy (Justin Henry) behind. Ted must now learn to be a father to his young son Billy and handle the responsibilities of fatherhood. What happens later in the film is that we start to understand the character of Joanna when she comes back to claim Billy and she takes the problem to court where things should be well, settled, right? The film offered light comedic moments from the first few minutes, but as we get more into the film itself, the comedy just lost its touch. Writer/Director Robert Benton could of had added more development in the film as well as more small snippets of comedic moments.The performances makes the film much, much better.The story lacks dimensions. Throughout the story, I felt that the plot was too simple even though I guess we do lack simplicity in the cinema. The dialogue seemed flat and at some point as if Hoffman was just talking to the wall. But what makes the performances so great? Hoffman and Streep nearly saves the movie and we look at these two actors and think that nobody else can claim this role. They look at everything with honesty and intelligence and we are convinced that these characters are approaching hazardous areas and lines they wish they didn't have to cross. As for Justin Henry, who plays Hoffman's son  he is quite good here too. (But my favorite child-actor performance still has to be Haley Joel Osment's in the The Sixth Sense.) Jane Alexander, who plays the single mother downstairs has perfect chemistry with Hoffman and we do believe that these two are friends having a everyday conversation. But I don't know how much you can trust me with my review: I haven't even read the book.The best ending ever? (spoilers) I having a mixed reaction to this film, unsure of how I feel about it. But I do have a definite answer to the ending because I loved it. I would try to not to spoil this for people who hasn't seen the film, and for those who have, it would be nice to know if you agree/disagree with me. The scene I am talking about is the very last scene in the lobby, where Ted and Joanna are talking to each other. Joanna is in tears, saying how she was taking her child from his home and Ted tries to comfort her. She wants to have a word with Billy so she enters the elevator to go upstairs and she tries to neaten herself up and asks Ted, ""How do I look?"" And he answers by simply saying, ""You look terrific."" The elevator closes between them and the film ends. Is this the best ending ever? Well, I thought so! The documentary found in the DVD  I would like to put in some comments about the documentary, ""Finding the Truth: The Making of Kramer vs. Kramer."" I really enjoyed the documentary and learning more about the film. I think the interviews with Hoffman were the most interesting. He is really hilarious to listen to and how he thought Henry looked like a ""sitcom kid"" is actually a worthy comment. Plus, we hear about how the signature moments in the film is all due to Hoffman's behalf: From the ice cream scene, to the shattered glass scene, and to the court scene where we see Ted nodding his head when Joanna was asked if she was a ""good mother.""

His character asks if a mother is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex. It's an interesting question that caused a lot of discussion when the film was in theaters.

In a world too cluttered with garbage, this is a chunk that should head straight for the incinerator. The 1970's was the decade of the baby boomer--and since I am one I think I can say without shame that shooting is too good for the principles in this cheap-shot.Director Robert Benton insists that he made the character of Joanna Kramer sympathetic and believable, and I'm assuming, in retrospect, that Meryl Streep--in this early outing--gave Benton just what he wanted. If she did, then what he wanted was far from sympathetic and believable only as a whining monster--for that is what Joanna Kramer is, a monster who wants it all, no matter what it costs anybody else in her life. I kept hoping for the deus ex machina to come in and strike her dead! Joanna is a cold, unlovable bitch and Meryl did such a good job of portraying her that it took me a long time to look at her in other roles to realize what a wonderful actress she is! Of course she has long since proved her versatility as an actress--the ghastly and unwatchable ""Mamma Mia!"" notwithstanding! Hoffman's performance is winning, and if the kid is a bit treacly, well, aren't they supposed to make you say ""a-w-w-w-w"" even as you barf? This film, obviously, is not high in my list.

I regard that as a big plus, the ability to present in front of the audience a story bereft of any prejudice. The father-son relationship is the chief highlight of this film, it's great to see it evolve so beautifully. When father and son set out to strengthen their bond around the film's start, they do so with trying out their hands at cooking some French toast. Their shoddy preparation doesn't lead them to getting any French toast cooked. Towards the film's end, there is another French toast scene.

See the film again and compare situations and possibilities from then(1978) with today. I think that many things have improved but there is also still a lot to make better .,Kramer vs. Kramer
165,wlandolfi-1,Good But Kind Of Over-Rated,7,31 October 2005,"KRAMER VS. KRAMER was a big hit for everyone involved when it came out in 1979 as it won awards for Best Actor for Dustin Hoffman, Best Supporting Actress for Meryl Streep and Best Picture. This movie was also significant as it is probably the first major movie to deal with divorce; an unfortunate but common occurrence in every day life. KRAMER VS. KRAMER tells the story of Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), an ad-executive who comes home one night only to find that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him with their 7 year old son Billy (played by Justin Henry). The movie goes through the day to day events as Ted tries to care for Billy and hold down a job. However, no sooner do the father and son learn to deal with one another that Joanna comes back and wants her son back. Of course, this leads to a court case where the two fight to have the kid. As was often the case with divorces at the time (this took place in the late '70's), the judge sided with the mother. However, after Joanna won the case, she came to decide at the very end that Billy indeed should stay with his father.In viewing this movie and I have done so a number of times over the years, I feel this movie is kind of over-rated. Here are some of the flaws that I see in the film. First of all, in the very beginning of the movie, we see that Joanna is packing her suitcase and basically announces to Ted that she is leaving. She doesn't seem to know where she is going or anything. Also, there does not seem to be any build up. True, the movie starts that way but I kind of felt there should have been a real confrontation between the couple first. On his part, it seemed like he had no sense that his wife was about to leave him although it is true that Ted Kramer was portrayed to be totally obsessed with his work. Of course, as I mentioned before, the bulk of the film deals with Ted learning to bond with his son. Another problem I had was that when Ted lost his job, he got a new one in ""less than 24 hours."" I realize that this was in the days before corporate downsizing laid people off in droves and it probably was not as hard to find another job that was self-supporting as it would be now. However, even back then, I don't think he would have found another job on a par of what he was doing (although it was considered a step-down for him) so fast despite his hustling for a new one. The movie does show that he was desperate to take ANY job at that point and it is true that when one is desperate, he or she will often do whatever it takes to get a new job. Anyway, I also had a problem with the way Ted conducted himself in the court scene when he was asked upsetting questions pertaining to how he made mistakes on the job and ultimately was let go. Granted, Ted was upset and rightfully so but I felt he should have handled himself better by keeping his answers short and not rambling on to defend his actions. As I mentioned before, at the time the movie took place, the judges almost always sided with the mother in a divorce but I do think the way Ted conducted himself may have contributed to why the judge went against him. Lastly, I felt that the ending did not seem plausible. At the end, Joanna, after winning the case, decided that her son did not belong with her but with his father instead. It did not make sense to me that she would have gone through all the trouble of fighting for custody only to say that her son did not belong with her although it was true that she did not really know what she wanted in her life. To me, a more realistic ending would have been that Billy went to live with his mother and that after work one day, Ted would go and pay a surprise visit to Billy. This would show Billy that while his father might not have full custody of him, his father would continue to be an important person in his life.In reading the comments I have just given, one might conclude that I did not like the film. That's not the case. It's just that I was pointing out what did not seem right to me. However, I did like the movie in the sense that some years ago, I took the time to buy a video-tape of it. Also, I enjoyed some of the scenes including where Ted makes French toast with his son. The scene where they do so after the trial showed how much closer they were from the beginning of the movie. Another scene worth mentioning is the famous one where the woman Ted is dating is staying over and Billy asks her (while she is naked) ""Do you like fried chicken?"" as it showed how cute and innocent he (Billy) really was. Overall, the movie did a good job of showing how Ted and his son bonded as there were scenes where they read together etc. I would say that was probably the strongest aspect of the film.",Kramer vs. Kramer

Ted doesn't know a lot of things like how to make French toast. Ted comes to do so many things that he has not done before. It is such a hard work for him, but they are getting closer and closer compared to before. One and a half year passes by, Joanna comes to Billy back. She decides to try a trial. How will they be in the end? The reason why I watched is my friend recommends me to watch. As my friend told me, it is worth watching, because the theme is family. We can understand the story easily, because it is related to every person. After I watch it, I come to think what the important thing it is, and if I were in the same situation as Billy, what I would think and feel. I want to recommend this to my friend too.",Kramer vs. Kramer
167,spotatoes,"A Thoughtful, Touching Drama",9,5 July 2018,"When it was first released, the subject matter of Kramer Vs. Kramer was not as commonplace as it is today, and so there was some shock value in it. As a viewer today, since something like fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, that shock, small as it was, has now completely disappeared. Maybe that's lost the film a sliver of its power, but, there is still enough here to make it compelling. The performances of Hoffman and Streep are utterly brilliant, conveying comprehensively the raw emotion involved in such a set of circumstances, and Justin Henry is outstanding as Billy. This is a tearjerker, but the tears come organically as a result of the story being told, and it never feels mawkish or manipulative in any way. So many films like this have resorted to sentimentality and to taking sides, but Kramer Vs. Kramer doesn't do that. It just uses a careful script, enhanced by deft direction, performed by truly great actors, to tell an honest and affecting story. If you haven't seen it, firstly, where have you been? And secondly, search it out and was it. It's pretty wonderful.",Kramer vs. Kramer

The general plot is that Joanna Kramer(Meryl Streep), after years of marriage, finally walks out on Ted Kramer(Dustin Hoffman), and a court battle ensues over who gets custody over the child. I won't go into too much detail, as that would ruin the story for you. In my opinion Meryl Strepp is the best actress of all time, and she and Dustin Hoffman are as good as always.

The man finally learns how to take the responsibility of a father to a son. It is not about giving birth but more important is to nurture him day by day.

However, even a good story can be ruined by bad acting, out of place cinematography, or weird philosophical directing. With Kramer vs Kramer, however, the acting was brilliant. The one nuance I want to point out here is that child acted like a child would--curious, but in general doesn't seem all that effected, but is more affected by the bashing exchanges between the mother and father--and this is why this film shines--it sheds light on a subject that children of divorce have to struggle through, among many of the hardships that people don't think of when considering the after-effects of divorce. Highly recommended.",Kramer vs. Kramer

The acting is flawless; so flawless that it doesn't even appear that they are acting. Dustin Hoffman is simply a joy in this movie. He's superb, and the love that grows between him (Ted) and his son (Billy) is so moving and sincere. It's just as powerful, if not more, than any romantic storyline out there in the movies. This is love. A love between a boy and his father. It's deep love. The type of man which Ted grows to be is a beautiful human being, and this is all due to love. He becomes a perfect role model for what a parent should be. Hoffman is excellent. The boy actor is perfect.

Very soon we have no choice but to see how  good a man he is (at least with his son, since they don't show the relationship he had with his wife).  Dustin Hoffman portrays that father very intensely (as with every of his characters in his career I think) and I found that Justin Henry is a fantastic kid actor.

175,sairam-subramani,Heart-warming tale of man and child caught in a custody battle,9,27 January 2011,"I have watched many movies and shows on TV that deal with divorce, but none as realistically and wonderfully as 'Kramer vs Kramer'. Led by Oscar-winners Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Meryl Streep (Best Actress in a Supporting Role) and a wonderful 8-year old Justin Henry, the movie deals with the difficulties faced by a family split by divorce.Once the basic outlines are revealed, the movie progresses to a touching story of a father who must manage his son on top of his usually busy work-schedule. As he struggles through this burden, he also learns that there is no substitute for the love of a child. He in turn becomes a competent father till things take a turn for the worst. How he handles this situation is admirable.In the golden decade for movies, 'Kramer vs Kramer' definitely doesn't compare to the likes of titles like 'The Godfather (Parts I and II)', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Sting', but is a classic in its own right, thanks to a brilliant script, sensational acting and wonderful scenes that will move you to tears.",Kramer vs. Kramer

People became too self-orientated and egoistic while searching for something they felt was missing inside of them.

Everybody's concentrating on pursuing their careers thinking that will make them feel complete but it only brings more misery.Joanna was feeling lost, unfulfilled and not useful? Well, she could have got herself a job. Yes, mother is the most important person in every child's life (especially from 3-5 years of age), but she could have paid a nanny from the earned money. Ted worked, took care of a kid, without the nanny. All alone. He managed somehow. Because he loved his son and felt responsible for him. The child doesn't come from out of nowhere, by it's own will. Father and mother are responsible for that. where was Ted when his son hit his head? HE was there! The bigger reason why Joanna left Ted was that she needed a man, meaning a lover.

179,Myrzan,IMHO this movie sucks (possible mild **SPOILERS**).,5,4 February 2005,"I'll first mention some movies I consider to be good so you'll know a bit what's my taste: L.A Confidential, American beauty, Gladiator, Blade Runner, Usual suspects and Forrest Gump.I have nothing particular against Streep or Hoffman. I have seen some of their other work and liked some of it. But I did not like Kramer vs Kramer.Maybe I was born too late (1980) to get this movie or something. I also didn't quite get Easy Rider, though I liked it more than this. But both of these movies somehow felt so.. seventies. It feels a bit like trying to watch a episode of Charlies Angels with a serious attitude. If you think you could do it, then maybe you can also enjoy this movie. Me, I inevitably get this more or less campy feeling. With Charlies Angels it doesn't matter but with Kramer vs. Kramer it really gets on my nerves.This movie felt a lot like Terms of Endearment except IMO this wasn't as good. In ToE there was Nicholson who gave the movie a lot of kick, Kramer vs Kramer felt in comparison really lame.Short synopsis: The movie is about this married couple with 1 kid (a boy) who break up because the guy pretty much dedicates his life to his work. The wife takes a hike but comes back after a while and then they start to bitch & whine about who'll get the kid.Some things that annoyed me: In the beginning of the movie when Teds wife left, why didn't the guy try to hire a nanny or something? This felt annoyingly illogical. Even his boss suggested he should get help. There were also other conflicts that seemed to be more or less made up like this. Ted and his wife never _really_ tried to talk to each other. It felt strange. If this was their relationship how did they ever even get married? Did they perhaps meet in a bar and then it was like ""Hi I'm Ted wanna get married with children?"" ""Mmkay cool.""First the movie felt too toothless and soapy, then when the child custody trial begun it turned into this stereotypical ridiculous slandering contest. Too much of the time the movie somehow didn't feel believable or fluent.IMO this movie isn't really worth watching. See Terms of endearment or Sleepless in Seattle instead.",Kramer vs. Kramer

How did this movie wind up winning five OSCARS. Unless the Academy was on something, this movie shouldn't even have been nominated.The movie tells the story of a man, Hoffman, being left by his wife at the beginning of the movie to ""find herself."" Huh? Find herself? Anyway, thats just the beginning. Soon Kramer, the husband, must change himself to accommodate his son. He misses appointments at work and he gets yelled at by the boss. So this is going on and Hoffman is beginning to start a new life. Suddenly Meryl comes back. She wants the son back. Then we go to a trial and somebody, I won't say who, wins.That is essentially the movie in whole. Now how was this Oscar Material. First of all the characters are not likable. I could not feel pity for them at all. I acutally felt pity for the boy in being raised in such a poor environment. Plus, the story didn't seem logical. A mother leaves her child, goes to California for eighteen months, comes back asking for her child back. Why didn't they at least try to maybe heal their marriage?These performances weren't good at all. Although the little boy's performance did make me sad for having been left by his mom and now having to rely on his dad, who hasn't been paying attention to him due to his apperent work-alcoholism.The movie does have a message that I can't reveal cause I don't want to spoil the ending, but once you see the movie you will know what I mean. I do agree with the message the movie is trying to portray, that maybe the father is sometimes better than the mother.The movie was not special in any way. It was jsut another movie, and I must admit it had some really funny, if not touching scenes. One of the scenes was where the boy and the father both sit at the table and read the newspaper at the same time. I just started laughing, it was so funny and touching. Besides another scene which is pretty funny, so I don't want to spoil it, there is nothing special.This was not Hoffman's or Streeps best performance. Far from it. Hoffman's best performance was in Tootsie and Rain Man, for which he won the Oscar. This performance was tame and not convincing as many of his performances are. Streep's performance wasn't Oscar worthy either. People this was not a good movie. Merryl's best performance was in Sophie's Choice, which is in my opinion the greatest acting done ever.I gave the movie a six.

182,ImKnaveOfHearts,One Time Watch,8,25 May 2021,"A simple divorce story that pulls a lot of emotional strings. Kramer vs. Kramer is based on a novel by Avery Corman of the same name. This legal drama is a 90s movie but worth a watch, starring; Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. (Although we see very little of Merly but she leaves her mark on the movie).Story Line & ActingA very straight forward storyline of a custody battle. This transcends into sharp arcs that mature the characters (main and the supporting ones). Like most movies, there is a period of transformation and it works out in par with time. The child actor played by Justin Henry gives a marvelous display of 7-year-old. Dustin takes his role to a new height (we know he won an Oscar for this movie and even slapped Meryl) - Totally justified.My Favourite (no spoiler)One of my favourite scenes were of the 'French toast' which circles back to the climax scene from the start. This also builds up the relationship that wasn't absent but wasn't present either between father and son.The dramaThe range of emotions that go on are commendable and cannot be ignored. The subtracting the work-life to balance household chores. The parenthood rather fatherhood; the irritable, less patient but protective. Friendship with a common loss and community that the father wasn't part of. The hue of emotions with a subjective verdict of good or bad and as simple as white or black. This all makes it a near perfect movie.My verdict: There wasn't a moment in the movie that I would want to revisit or watch it again, It was a onetime watch movie, that captures attention and plays on emotions.",Kramer vs. Kramer

The movie covers its difficult topic about as well as it can be covered. It doesn't offer any easy answers, like so many similar movies. Thus it respects the subject matter and presents hard emotional truths for us to swallow. And that is how a person can develop a wise heart. Ideally, all movies would be working toward promoting the right emotional and intellectual responses in all of us, instead of desensitizing us toward serious human issues and rendering us apathetic and stupid. Kramer vs. Kramer demonstrates how a movie, simply by provoking the right questions and framing issues discerningly, does not have to offer many explicit answers to be extremely meaningful and constructive. And, in a way, doing that is an answer to life's problems. Perhaps one of the most important kinds of answers of all.

Watching today, the father Ted (played by Hoffman) was penalized for supporting his family and putting food on the table, while poor little Joanna got her fee fees hurt and mysteriously abandons her husband and child for months and months with no explanation. Joanna, played by Streep is almost embarrassing with her overacting emos. Joanna had plenty of options available to her, but took the coward's way out. There was marriage counseling (Ted would have at least tried), or how about just talking instead of acting like a wounded teen that can't go to the movies on a Sat night.

192,folk-rainbowfan,Very Realistic Drama With An Unorthodox Ending,8,12 July 2012,"OK, so here's what happened to me...I was sitting in my chair at home, all alone, and on netflix, wanting to watch some sort of drama that I knew I would love. I had watched ""The Graduate"" the previous night, so I didn't mind watching yet another Dustin Hoffman movie. I had absolutely no prior knowledge of the plot nor the theme of the movie. I chose it simply because it had Dustin Hoffman in it. After starting the movie, I was in for one of the biggest movie shocks of my life. Not because it was better or worse than I had expected, but because I could relate to it. My parents got divorced, and although divorce can be a terrible thing, there was no happy ending to the story of my parents divorcing and leaving my brother and I to figure out what to think and how to feel about such a sudden and deliberate act of irresponsibility and above all, confusion. My mom was asleep in the couch, but because she is such a heavy sleeper, I knew I would be able to watch ""Kramer vs Kramer"" without her watching it with me. I was wrong. She woke up towards the beginning and immediately said ""Kramer vs Kramer?"".... she knew what I was watching. I watched it with her, but we didn't look at each other until the very end, and then she left. I would give this movie a 10 due to the connectivity I had with it, but I must give it an 8 due to an issue I had with the plot: the ending. The movie was great, the plot was great, the situation was unbelievably realistic, but the ending was not. More often than not, divorce does not end well. There will always be problems, and the child (or children) will never be completely happy. It was total Deus ex Machina. I don't know what to say? I mean, first Mrs. Kramer leaves, goes to California, sees a whole bunch of people, and 18 months later she comes back and demands custody? Then she basically says ""oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that my son is happy living with his father, who is a great parent."" Then she decides to let her son live with the father after spending thousands of dollars in lawyer fees? I hate to sound rude or anything, but even if she did realize that her son would be better off living with his father, I wouldn't pay a lawyer $15,000 and then walk out of that apartment empty handed. You have to realize that people who get divorced lose all rationality and the ability to reason, because if they had it in the first place, they would never have gotten a divorce. You don't just leave your child and then say ""oh, I love my child, can I have him/her back please?"" All in all, the ending was exactly how it should have turned out, but it reality, it doesn't. I only like this movie because it gives me hope to think that people will watch this and realize that divorce is not a pretty thing, and even if divorce is the only way, you can at least cope with it and do what's best for everyone, and not what's best for you.",Kramer vs. Kramer
193,Virilene-Manly,Hype vs. Reality,4,14 May 2016,"Satisfied to have finally seen this film, some 37 years after it first came out. Viewing the film fills in a gap of my pop-cultural understanding at least. The content, however, is extremely dated, reflecting the fact that it is a product of its time. Not at all surprising to hear that the film was based on a reactionary, anti- feminist, quasi-misogynist novel, which is made manifest by the total subordination of Streep's Joanna to Hoffman's Ted. Don't be fooled by the false hype of two great actors going head-to-head. The very, very young Streep is hardly in the film at all, and the character Joanna's motivations are only thinly alluded to, never fully explained. This is strictly a vehicle for Hoffman to project as hot-shot advertising executive transitioning into a put-upon father. For his part, with the exception of Marathon Man and Tootsie, Hoffman never fails to remind me how much I'd really rather be watching Al Pacino in the same role. The supposedly climactic court scene is so cheesily melodramatic and utterly false. that it can only be viewed as some misogynist wet dream, complete with ridiculous shouting and badgering by conspicuously male divorce lawyers. Joanna's speech, supposedly penned in a fit of brilliance by Streep herself, is cringe-inducingly nebulous. Streep can be forgiven, she was only 27. The director/""screedwriter"" Robert Benton shouldn't be let off so easily, however. In the end, this is fairly typical 70s schlock that turned out to be quite profitable. Good for the business of ""movies"", bad for the art of cinema. My curiosity was more killed than satisfied.",Kramer vs. Kramer
194,ric-brasacchio,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,19 March 2014,"Kramer vs Kramer is an excellent movie. The story is pretty easy - SPOILER - there is a family, the mother (Meryl Streep) escape from home and the father (Dustin Hoffman) have to deal with everything, including their son, by himself. The acting is tremendous and Mr Hoffman and Mrs Streeo are at their best. There are no unexpected twists in the plot and it's very easy to follow the story. Even though a plot without twists doesn't seem very appealing, the acting will get you glued to screen. Furthermore all the music and the shots are very accurate and precise; especially for a movie realized in 1979. I suggest everyone to watch this movie.",Kramer vs. Kramer
195,mp234003,Liked it,8,1 January 2009,"I thought this film was quite good and quite entertaining for a film heavy on emotion. I agree with what another user wrote about the script being sympathetic to the three main characters. I think that this is what what made the film good. It didn't villainies either Mr. or Mrs. Kramer and it was refreshing, I think, to see two people essentially work the issue out on their own and eventually do the best thing for Billy. And, although it was a little strange, I actually liked the music in this film as well. For some reason the music seemed appropriate for the journey that the three main characters embarked upon. This movie flowed quite well and didn't doodle, like some emotionally heavy films tend to do. It dealt with a serious situation but didn't take itself too seriously. It simply told the story in a straight forward way and it worked quite well.",Kramer vs. Kramer
196,manzoor,One of my top 5 movies of all time,10,29 February 2000,"""Kramer vs Kramer"" was the best movie when I first saw it (almost 15+ years ago) and it still is. Everything in it, the acting, the photography, the cast, the background music everything was as close to perfection as any movie I've ever seen. And of course the ""plot"" - I've never seen anything that even comes close.It's about a Man whose wife just left him to go ""find herself"". It's about his career, about his marriage (that he probably took for granted) and his son.It's about a woman who has just left her husband and her son to go find herself. To figure out who she is (independent of being a wife and a mother). And it is about her son whom she loves dearly.It's about a little boy whose mother has just left him and whose father is not really prepared to be his ""father"" and his ""mother"" though his father loves him very much.But mostly it's about a man his son trying to get on with their lives without the person who had kept it all glued together. It's about the father learning to make french-toast, it's about the son learning ""mommys sometime go away"" even though it was nothing that he did. It's about learning that some things are more important than your career.",Kramer vs. Kramer
197,stebbif-2,Excellent and unforgettable movie,10,28 March 2000,"This movie is one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are just superb in this film and they both won an oscar for their acting. In this story we see the positive and negative side of how it affects kids when their parents divorce. Justin Henry is very good in the role of Billy Kramer, the son of the divorced couple. The final scene with Streep and Hoffman is simply unforgettable and superb. This film won the best actor and actress in a supporting role and of course as picture and also won for best director. This is one of those film which improves with the years. It´s simply unforgettable and excellent example of the best of the best in the movie history of the 20th century. See it and you know what I truly mean. It will in the future be considered as one of the milestones of the pictures from the seventies",Kramer vs. Kramer
198,pablo43_1999,I Was Extremely Surprised,10,21 August 2000,When I put the tape in the VCR I thought that I would spend the next hour and a half feeling bored.  I had no idea that Kramer Vs. Kramer would have such a powerful impact on me.  The story of a fathers struggle in learning how to love his son is absolutely amazing.  His love is then tested when the wife who left him comes back and tries to win custody of their child. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep both deliver flawless performances in the beautifully moving film.,Kramer vs. Kramer
199,AlexandreaCassandra,Kramer vs. Kramer,9,23 September 2009,"As I said in my review of RAIN MAN, a family drama doesn't have to be an epic (like fellow nominee APOCALYPSE NOW) to win Best Picture. (Coincidentally, Hoffman appeared in both films.) KRAMER VS. KRAMER isn't just about divorce, it's also about a father trying to connect with his son and juggle a successful career at the same time. This is something every mother, father, and even child can relate to. Dustin Hoffman is Ted Kramer, said father in this wrenching film. Meryl Streep is Joanna Kramer, the other half of the title. Jane Alexander is their friend and neighbor, Margaret Phelps. And 8-year-old Justin Henry is Ted and Joanna's son, Billy. Along for the emotional ride is Howard Duff, as Ted's lawyer John Shaunessy, and JoBeth Williams as Ted's bed partner and secretary, Phyllis. Based on the 1977 novel by Avery Corman, KRAMER VS. KRAMER deals with the effects of abandonment (this time by a mother!), divorce, estrangement, and reconnection. It is a sobering look at a successful executive who's life couldn't be better until his wife leaves him due to unsatisfaction and marital unhappiness. His attempt to connect with his little son, the boy's mother returning after ""finding herself,"" and ending in a bittering custody battle. What can you say about this film? I'll tell you! It was something that I, a very stubborn young man, could understand and relate to. I, myself, was a child of a broken home. My parents were Ted and Joanna; and I was Billy! This film deserves every accolade it got! Anyone, who disagrees has either no heart or no common sense! (But, you're entitled to your opinion.) Winner of 5 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Stanley R. Jaffe, producer; Best Director and Adapted Screenplay - Robert Benton; Best Actor - Dustin Hoffman; and Best Supporting Actress - Meryl Streep; along with nominations for Justin Henry for Best Supporting Actor and Jane Alexander also as Best Supporting Actress. This is a film that inspires and unlifts the spirit just by telling a realistic story without explosions, special effects, or violence. Though I did enjoy APOCALYPSE NOW, I still think KRAMER VS. KRAMER deserved to win. Why? Because it made me cry, something that is very difficult to do! That scene where Ted and Billy say their supposed good-byes (Joanna wins, of course; the mother always wins!) tore me to shreds. Incredible!",Kramer vs. Kramer
200,waterytwist,What a great movie!,10,6 August 2003,"It is my first time watching this movie.  I loved it, especially the vintage clothing.  Dustin Hoffman, a great actor in the movie.  Meryl Streep was not on that much.  It was a nice simple film about life and family values.  It reminds us that life is not just about work, it's about little things you do everyday.  Such as making breakfast, bringing your child to school, reading a bedtime story, etc. Overall 10/10.",Kramer vs. Kramer
201,patrickcoelho,About a boy and his father,6,20 June 2007,"Well, this movie is actually more about the father. Hoffman, who won his first Best Actor at the Oscar's for this role, has surely done better stuff before this. Most people who have seen ""Midnight Cowboy"" would vouch for that. However, what's compelling about the film is the relationship between Hoffman and his son, played by a very cute Justin Henry. Hoffman is best when he is paired off with another compelling character - as Anne Bancroft in 'The Graduate', Steve McQueen in 'Papillon', Robert Redford in ""All the President's Men"" and Tom Cruise in ""Rainman"" show us. Meryl Streep is a bit lost as the slightly neurotic wife who walks out on the family (a character that feminists would not have been too happy about). All in all worth a watch, but I wouldn't go back to it a second time. I think the reason why the movie did so well was because of the sensitive issue it dealt with -- divorce and custody of a little child in the late 1970's.",Kramer vs. Kramer
202,Chrislongley-303-908980,Is great!,6,28 February 2012,"""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a terrific drama about an unhappy woman who walks out on her husband and young son. The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in ""Rainman"", which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable.",Kramer vs. Kramer
203,tjb103,Why doesn't Kramer vs Kramer get more recognition for the great film that it is?,9,6 January 2005,"While I do not consider Hoffman to be the pinnacle actor from 'the golden age' of the 70s (I mean he clearly must have been doing 'Outbreak' for the money or something), I cannot fault him in this wonderful performance. It is, in my mind, one of the hardest genres to do; the basis for most TV films on on a Thursday afternoon, so hats off to Robert Benton for the TERRIFIC script. Hoffman has never been better as Ted Kramer, and I found myself becoming deeply involved in his plight to keep his son. He rivals Pacino for acting with his eyes (in this I mean the way he uses one simple look to express everything he is feeling - for instance his look after his son tells him that he loves him), and it was just a really believable story portrayed by Hoffman in a really believable way. I feel that writers and directors these days often don't consider what is credible to the audience enough - even in science fiction, if that makes sense. I think that Dustin Hoffman, despite his numerous Oscar nominations and the two he succeeded with (this film rightly being one of those), is underrated and does not get as much praise as he deserves. But one great actor and a great script does not make the perfect movie. Think of the greatest films of all time: Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Casablanca, Schindler's List etc. - all may have great scripts, and all may have great leading actors in Travolta, Brando, Bogart and Neeson, but it is the supporting cast that truly turns a very good film into a great film. Meryl Streep is the best screen actress of all time by a country mile - and her part in this film is a significant one that makes the film what it is. Just watch the courtroom scene - MY GOD that is good acting. And once again, she is believable. She is in nearly all her films, but here this statement rings true more than ever. And do not forget the part of Justin Henry - who unfortunately did not go on to set the acting world alight: a shame considering his obvious talent in this film which in my opinion (and I know I'm laying the praise on pretty thick here) is the best child performance in cinema history: even better than Nathalie Portman in Leon. So to conclude my little film review, I hope that I have influenced someone out there to have a look at this movie that won several Oscars and appreciate it in the way I have. If not for Hoffman, or Streep, or Benton's script, then watch it for Kramer's lawyer's awesome moustache.",Kramer vs. Kramer
204,Jake_GoldsteinStreet,Kramer vs. Kramer was Groundbreaking,9,8 June 2014,"The movie Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman who won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Ted Kramer, Chris Henry who played Billy Kramer who was the youngest ever nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and last but not least Meryl Streep who plays Joanna Kramer the erratic mother of Billy Kramer and ex husband of Ted. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work. In the early moments of this film you see Joanna leaving Ted because he never listens to her and has a idea of what a wife should be like and she isn't but he doesn't understand that. Ted is now left with Billy who have troubles, whether it be trying to make breakfast, Ted having troubles at work or Billy spilling what looks like Cranberry juice on slides for Ted's big presentation which lead to him losing his job. The turning point of this film is when Billy decides to be a rebel and eat ice cream before eating dinner and Ted gets quite mad and throws him into his bed and calls him a little crap. Also, their is a strong friendship that continually builds between Joanna's good friend Margaret played by Jane Alexander and Ted. They have a lot in common, both were recently divorced and have young children. Later, Joanna comes back from her extended trip to LaLa land expecting to regain custody of her child. Her main tactic against Ted is saying that Ted caused Billy to ""almost lose his eye"". Everything ends well when Joanna steps up and decides that Billy's real home is his room in Ted's apartment. The final words lead us to believe that Ted and Joanna might get back together when he says ""You look terrific."" when she is going up to see Billy for what may or may not be the last time.

I haven't quite been through a divorce or legal custody battle myself but I do have a 4 yr old daughter and went through a 9th month period where the father of my child left us, so I totally relate to the emotions portrayed in the movie. In a situation like that, for me, the person who I felt the most for and just broke my heart apart to watch, was the little boy but that's not to take away from the obvious that it's just so emotionally exhausting for the parents as well in a situation like that.The performances by all the cast was stellar with exceptional recognition to Meryl Streep, Dustin Hoffman and the Little boy (not sure what his real name is). Such well deserved Oscars for Meryl and Dustin, it would have been great if the little boy had won was well as he was also nominated (and at only 8 yrs).Even though I cried a lot, (and you probably will too) I would recommend this movie for everyone.It is one of those timeless classics that is just as much relevant and relate able to today as when it was first made, and probably in 50 - 100 years still. I will be watching this again soon, its really just that good!!! If you haven't seen it, you really should! 10/10",Kramer vs. Kramer

It keeps you entertained, but it doesn't give you much to talk about.",7,23 October 2014,"The lead (Dustin) and both supporting (Merryl and Justin Henry 'Billy'), keep the audience mindful throughout, and hopeful for a big upcoming reward. But at every corner when the action appears to be about to throw you from your chair, it brings you right back down without never achieving a climax. The relationship between Ted and his son is pleasant to watch, but is just too uneventful. Someone might expect the courtroom scenes to present some kind of revelation and build to a climatic moment (the title of the movie directly refers to a court of law dispute between the two 'Kramer' parties), but all that is said we the audience already know. All that the two lawyers do is put up a show of bravado with nothing ingenious in their speeches and we remain without knowing what really led the jury to their verdict (we have to settle for the all too general remarks made during the movie which 'normally' lead a jury to decide). The film reaches a moment when is difficult to care about the fate of the child, I myself couldn't care less if our hero Dustin would keep custody, or if crying Meryl would be the one taking him home.",Kramer vs. Kramer

People are like volcanoes.The more lava is trapped inside them,the bigger the explosion...That's was exactly the case of Joanna Kramer..A mother and wife who was trapped inside her husband's routine,until she couldn't take anymore. On the other hand,the case of Ted Kramer,a workaholic father who forgets that family is above all,gives a great life lesson. You have to struggle for what you love. The more you struggle,the more you will have to overcome difficulties.Ted had to learn how to live and communicate with his son,who finally became the one and only person in his life.

At the last 10 years, we are so disappointed from all new movies - stupid stories for example ""No country for old man"" or ""There will be blood"". This movies are not serious, and in them don't have deep trues, they take us nothing, just stupid actions and more stupid soundtracks. The level of our cinema decrease and if this continues, the situation will be absolutely catastrophic.

209,hummel-5,"Fantastic Performances From Hoffman and Henry, Great Direction",10,14 August 2006,"I hadn't seen this film in maybe twenty years. When I first saw it I was not a parent; I am now. There are few films that do a better job of explaining of how it feels to be a parent, and how much a young child depends on you.Be sure to watch the outstanding documentary about the film (after you see the movie!)--it gives you a rare look into the wonderful collaborative atmosphere that surrounded this movie. You can see why some directors who like to have total control (hello, Woody!) would not enjoy working with Hoffman, but you can see how wise Benton was to draw on Hoffman's own personal experience of divorce. The movie is so rich, the performances so real, the direction nicely understated when it needs to be, and the emotions so intense.This is a ""small film"" that is so well done, it illuminates better than any grand statement about parenting ever could. I was deeply moved by this film.As I say in the summary--the rapport between Hoffman and young Justin Henry is so real, and their individual and collective performances are off the scale. They're too realistic and human to even measure. I've never seen anything so authentic. Director Benton deserves so much credit for letting the actors find the truth of this movie's story.In terms of weaknesses, there are few, but I thought Ms. Streep wasn't quite as convincing as the rest (she's better near the end), and that Hoffman's ""party kiss"" was also a false note. Other than that, everything else is so true that I really had to give the film a ten, and the DVD with this fantastic documentary also merits a ten. It was so generous of all the creative talent to give their time for interviews over twenty years later.Great, great film!! You can see why it won five Oscars.",Kramer vs. Kramer
210,Candy-Holic,Clearly one of the greatest films ever made!,9,4 February 2006,"What can I say about Kramer vs. Kramer? On the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself. It delivers many fantastic moments, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry. You sympathize with the characters and you care about them. Many films fail at this, Kramer vs. Kramer is a success.I think everyone would agree the acting is superb. Once you watch Kramer vs. Kramer, for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional. The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen. There's some beautiful chemistry between them. I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry. He's different from any other child actor I've ever seen. He's amazingly natural.Also, there's some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep. And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career! The story is very well written. It's simple but complicated at the same time. The concept is the simple part, the feelings associated is the complicated part of it.If you haven't seen this film yet, you're definitely missing out!

211,mousetrap32,"A movie with a simple story, told superbly well",10,1 February 2001,"This movie always works for me, no matter how many times I see it. I often wonder how they took such a simple story and made it work so well. The answer would probably lie in the acting of all the cast, even the child actor Justin Henry. The chemisty between he and Dustin Hoffman made for some very memorable scenes, and this is why we get drawn into what seems to be an often told tale. Some of the best scenes for me are those that involve no dialogue, just action. We see them getting up in the morning, walking to the bathroom and into the kitchen. They co-operate without speaking; they get donuts for breakfast, milk, glasses, Hoffman reads the newspaper and Henry reads a comic book. Again, later, the day Henry is set to leave, they quietly make french toast, they do it like a well oiled machine unlike a previous scene where the impression was they didn't know too much about each other for a father and son, and quite obviously it was rare for Hoffman to be in the kitchen doing ""mom"" duties. We see them grow together throughout the movie, and this is the big attraction for me.There is no padding in this movie, each scene is needed and tells what it is supposed to. Unlike other movies of this theme, you never cringe, and you get a sense of these people and what they're about. The story is painfully honest, and superbly done.",Kramer vs. Kramer

I am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me, but this movie had all the right combinations for ""stirring"". The passion of the actors,without the overacting, the aching for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, all make this a must see movie, despite the fact that it is 1970s. This is definitely not an ""old movie"", but a classic/vintage movie. I hope you engage with it as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful, but once they are made the pain will subside, but only gradually. This movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost/lack of love.

As a feature film, it's used technique the documentary usually uses, which renders the basic tone with on families. It's actually story to fit my time but set up in different cultural environment with mine because I got similar age with Billy's. The minimalism storyline has been strictly framed within a case of court battle, following which the struggle for a son ward ship between parents was recorded comprehensively on various levels and angles. In fact, the film's painted an imagery of family affair for audience with Kramers as very much reflection of the condition of other families worldwide. The film becomes gradually fascinating alongside the step-by-step deeper analysis of society then conflicts getting more serious, eventually, the nature of countless social problems step-by-step came up with digging then discovering. Despite the title seems to suggest the battle between parents, actually much beyond that, it is a bit tricky and witty, an implication of struggling between Ted Kramer, his wife Joanna Kramer and his son Billy Kramer. The film ends with court sentence, no winners instead of all exhausted losers because the court would give Billy painful experience really as the crime his parents committed has.Once the court started to process the case of son's ward right, Billy was badly hurt in psychological term just like a victim. Moreover, the lawyer on behalf of Ted Kramer seems out of control and lost his mind when the result defines them losers, he even wanted to take account of innocence of victim to gain sympathy then win this war, with that they consider to make appeal with Billy appearing on court. The court event will haunt Billy's growing-up life as very severe spiritual pain, which will be healed long time after.Sometimes, the mankind's cruelty could be expressed even much more serious than animal kind's. Disney's ""Lion King"" has proved that how much encouragement dad lion prepared to save his son's life when attacked by wolves. Dad lion always tried to protect son all time with fearless passion. Mankind would be taught the lesson of love for survival because man's just pupil to nature. In reality, the friendly relationship between people on highly civilisation level does not exist anymore since the law rules the world. People has to express or be expressed the cruelty against somebody else for their own survival in such an urbanised environment. What a stupid pursuit to civilisation! The most ruthless careers must include lawyer and doctor. Yet both of them have been earning the most expensive salary, meanwhile both are ruthless group without any mercy to clients.

At first I thought this was only another Hollywood dramas in which people cry all the time and make you cry as well (humans are naturally prone to cry in front of other people crying, and Hollywood takes a lot of advantage on it). Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in this movie, just as Meryl. They're both very talented. This movie captured my attention and emotions in the very first 20 minutes, which is rare when it comes to drama. It happened that I caught myself crying like a little baby at the end of the movie. It really made me think about how destructive a divorce can be, just as much as an unhappy marriage. I really recommend you guys to watch it",Kramer vs. Kramer
220,ebcarrier,Dustin Hoffman rocks & gets rocked in 1970's NYC Ad World,8,17 September 2007,"This is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a Manhattan ad agency: the pressure to perform; client and agency demands; the parties; the creativity; the money; the cool surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. Toss in parenthood for Dustin Hoffman. The movie is textured and deep. It follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his the relationship with his son. While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for least screen time to win an Oscar? She sure can deliver when she is on, though.",Kramer vs. Kramer
