0,SnoopyStyle,Confused bad science and history,5,23 December 2013,"ITC accidentally discovers a worm hole to Castlegard France in 1357 and they sponsor a dig at the site. Archaeologist Prof. Edward Johnston (Billy Connolly) gets sent back in time. Then his son Chris (Paul Walker), and his students Kate Erickson (Frances O'Connor), François Dontelle (Rossif Sutherland), and André Marek (Gerard Butler) find a strange plea for help from the professor in the past at the dig site. Finally they're told of the time travel. The group and company security Frank Gordon (Neal McDonough) goes back to try to retrieve the professor.It's a little too complicated and too confusing of a setup. The group would never be a good group to send back. The languages have changed over time. They would need experts at medieval languages. And they are way too easy to convince to go back. After all, they're going into a war zone. Not to mention there is the possibility of changing history. None of it is treated seriously. It has a lot of scientific gobbledegook that added up to whole lot of unreasonableness.After ignoring all the unreasonableness, it tries to be realistic with the action. It's not flywire kung fu fighting. It's amateur sword fighting from Medievel Times. The characters are too manic. The constant bickering doesn't make for a fun watch. All the time they're there. I keep thinking they're changing the past, and nobody cares one bit. It's not a thoughtful group, and it's not a thoughtful movie. On top of everything, we're suppose to root for the french who are the good guys.",Timeline
1,claudio_carvalho,Great Sci-Fi Adventure,8,13 November 2004,"In Dordogne Valley in France, Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly), his assistants Andre Marek (Gerard Butler) and Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor) and a team of archaeologists find the ruins of a castle called 'La Roque' and a monastery, destroyed in 1357 in the War of One Hundred Years between France and England. His son Chris Johnston (Paul Walker) is working with the group because he is in love with Kate. The sponsor of the expedition is the International Technology Corporation (ITC) and after the travel of Professor Johnston to a meeting with the executives of ITC, the team finds a plea for help and a lens of Professor Johnston in the ruins. ITC sends a plane for bringing the group to the headquarter and explain them that their research team had accidentally found a wormhole to that place in the Fourteenth Century, and the Professor had insisted to travel in time to help his discoveries, but now he was trapped in 1357. The group decides to travel to the past to help him, and this is the beginning of a great adventure. I glanced the titles of some reviews and I do not agree that this movie is awful or a waste of time. On the contrary, I found it a great movie, having action, romance and everything else that I expect to see in this genre. I highly recommend this movie for fans of sci-fi stories with time travel. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Linha do Tempo' ('Timeline')",Timeline
2,nogodnomasters,Not a Cliffhanger,6,23 June 2019,"If you have seen LOTR twenty times and want to take a break and watch something else. Timeline might do. It is science fiction, but not good science fiction. The ""science"" in it leaves a lot to be desired. How did they do those quick field C-14 readings? It is a love story, but not a great love story as there is virtually no character development. It is history as there was a 100 years war, but the facts in this story are manufactured. This was year 20 of the 100 Years War and even if the English did win this battle, it really would not have altered history as England simply didn't have a big enough army to hold and occupy France, even if no one lived there. They couldn't have won that war. . . even in a 100 years. Yes, it is also an action flick, but don't expect a lot of it.A corporation accidentally discovers a wormhole and time travel. The wormhole always leads to the same place in time, Castleguard in France, 1357. They transport back an archaeologist who gets stuck back there. They then send back a party to rescue him. Like most movie rescue parties, more people die trying to save one person than what it was worth. Oh yes, a woman is saved, who was supposed to die and this was supposed to have altered history, shades of Dr. McCoy!",Timeline

As a group of medieval re-enactors were used for soldiers in battle sequences . The crew of the movie visited various European castles from around that period , the late 1300s , to make the castles and towns look as realistic as possible. The runtime film is adjusted about hundred minutes and for that reason isn't boring , neither tiring . The movie blends action , historical events , suspense , medieval battles and is enough amusing . The picture didn't fail at the box office but wasn't a real success either . From the start until the ending the action and the fast-moving is continued but there is a wrong pace . The picture is partially based on historical events ; however , the battle of Castlegard is not an actual historical deed .

4,wes-connors,War Time and Again,4,12 January 2009,"After a confusing opening, the story moves to an archaeological dig, in France. There, action-oriented Paul Walker (as Chris Johnston) visits Scottish professor father Billy Connolly (as Edward Johnston). Although visiting only twice annually, Mr. Walker has managed to fall for female archaeologist Frances O'Connor (as Kate Ericson). But, Ms. O'Connor prefers digging dirt to digging Walker. ""It sucks big time,"" he tells ace excavator and Scottish sword enthusiast Gerard Butler (as André Marek).After two days pass, the excavating team receives a message from the suddenly hike-taking Mr. Connolly, who has become trapped in the year 1357. As it turns out, the absent professor has been traveling through time, due to the discovery of a wormhole (time portal) by the International Technology Corporation (ITC). Walker and a team don 14th century clothing, and go 600 years into the past, to rescue the professor. They have six hours. Stuff goes wrong... horribly wrong! Not a very good adaptation of Michael Crichton's original novel - but, you can see it is an interesting read. The main story and ""romance"" is, herein, between Walker and O'Connor. But, the one to watch is Mr. Butler, who meets his ""soul mate"", pretty Anna Friel (as Lady Claire), in the past. And, Michael Sheen (as Lord Oliver) goes to the head of the cast, performance-wise. Director Richard Donner fills of ""Timeline"" with plenty of ACTION at the expense of storytelling. Some nice settings (while not always practical) and scenery (Québec serves as France) aren't enough to sustain interest.**** Timeline (11/19/03) Richard Donner ~ Paul Walker, Frances O'Connor, Gerard Butler",Timeline
5,Doylenf,Another Michael Crichton science fiction novel that strains credibility...,6,30 July 2005,"Some of the comments here make TIMELINE seem like the worst science fiction story ever to hit the screen. While the logic is flawed--in fact, non-existent at times, especially with regard to time travel --the presentation by Richard Donner does have some solidly entertaining moments. Unfortunately, he fails to bring the characters alive by spending too much time on detailed battle scenes.The trouble is the script, not the actors. Obviously it was necessary to condense all the technical jargon and explanations made by Crichton in his novel in order to have a film that still runs two hours. But Donner has decided to lavish all his time and attention on the extravagant recreation of the medieval battle scenes, neglecting to flesh out any of his characters. As a result, the film rushes from one breathless battle to another the moment the entry into 14th Century France is made--and it's hard to root for characters who may be killed ruthlessly but have failed to come alive in the first place.Unfortunately, neither of the young female leads is charismatic enough or credible enough to warrant all the attention they get from the male leads. On the other hand, the leading men (Ken Walker and Gerard Butler) have looks to spare, both of them superior in the looks department. Acting-wise, Butler has a distinct advantage over Walker, making his Andre Marek, the archaeologist, the film's real hero, giving his character the sort of backbone missing in Walker's performance. Butler's flirtation in the boat scene is skipped over too lightly, an example of how weak the love interest is in the scheme of things. Director Donner should have put a little more emphasis on this scene to make the twist ending more credible.While the sets are stunningly recreated, the extended battle scenes become a bit exhausting after awhile (hard to tell whether you're watching LORD OF THE RINGS, GLADIATOR or BRAVEHEART combined), and, of course, none of the storyline really makes sense when you stop to think about it.But, as an action flick, it's fairly worthwhile as a film rental. Having seen Butler in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, I was interested in checking him out in other films and see that he's a very capable actor who has yet to find a really good vehicle for his considerable acting range.As for the bitter complaints about all the changes and omissions from Crichton's book, credit should be given to the scriptwriters who were able to pare down all of the exposition and technical jargon into a workable script. I understand the writers on JURASSIC PARK had the same problem and many changes were made.Trivia note: Brian Tyler's busy background score is riveting. Jerry Goldsmith had to withdraw from the assignment due to illness and Brian does a fine job as a replacement, adding much zest to all of the action sequences. And the outdoor photography in Quebec (serving as France) is truly excellent.",Timeline
6,preppy-3,"Big, loud, noisy...and dull",4,21 July 2005,"Silly time travel movie. A archaeologist (somehow) finds a ""wormhole"" to 1347 France. That's when there was a huge battle (or something...history isn't my best subject). He goes back to get artifacts...and never returns. So his stupid son (Paul Walker) and friends (Gerard Butler, Frances O'Connor and some others who are just there to get killed) travel back to find him. Naturally everything goes wrong and they may be stuck there for good.What's wrong with this movie? Just about everything. The script is REAL stupid...full of implausible situations and characters and some truly jaw-dropping twists and turns. Aside from the dubious ""science"" I find it hard to believe a bunch of people from 2003 could even remotely understand French from 1347. Yet they have no trouble talking here. The stupidest subplot (and that's saying a bit) has Butler's character falling in love (very quickly) with a French lady who he knows will be killed. Oh, the irony (sarcasm)! There are tons of explosions and fights to keep the audience awake. It all ends with a big huge battle which LOOKS expensive but I was bored silly. There's also lots of casual violence and killings in the movie--but there's never any blood so that makes it OK for a PG-13 rating.As for the acting--Paul Walker (the ""star"") is VERY handsome with a nice body but simply can't act--at ALL! His blank stare (flashing his big baby blue eyes) quickly becomes annoying. I was SO hoping he would get killed. He makes Keanu Reeves look like an accomplished actor. The rest of the cast either overacts (Butler and O'Connor), underacts (Billy Connolly) or just have this pained look on their faces (understandable). The biggest surprise was Gerard Butler being so bad. He's been very good in other movies.This was a HUGE box office bomb--it's easy to see why. Purportedly if you're a scientist or a history major this is hysterically funny. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 4.",Timeline

You could, but you really wouldn't want to.The Michael Crichton's novel ''Timeline'' was not well served by this screenplay that tells of scientists that travel back to 1357.The movies was painfully long and there was no chemistry between the love interests.Andre (Gerard Butler) and Lady Clare (Anna Friel) went from how do you do to commitment in record time. Then he has to decide whether to travel back or stay. Duh! Then there is Chris (Paul Walker),and Kate (Frances O'Connor). Walker, who became a star with ''The Fast and the Furious,'' just has to smile to get the girl. So 1950s.The fact that we really can't relate to these characters means that we really don't care that the time machine may not work. Let them get stuck in 1357. They deserve it.",Timeline
8,Boba_Fett1138,It falls flat as an entertaining and ambitious movie.,5,23 December 2005,"""Timeline"" is a movie that sounds good on paper but as a movie it falls flat. This is due to several reasons of which the cast and the script are a few.I really enjoy time travel movies in which 2 different cultures and times collapse. It's always good for some entertainment and an imaginative story. Than how comes ""Timeline"" doesn't work as entertainment? Well, mainly because it's simply not entertaining. From a director like Richard Donner you should and could expect some more entertainment and fun. The movie takes itself very serious, which makes the story uninteresting and at times also hard to follow. Basically the movie is about the British and French fighting each other, without us ever fully understanding why, or caring about it. The story had all the potential of becoming a sort of new 'Indiana Jones' like adventure movie but unfortunately the end result is far from that. At times the story gets incredibly lame and predictable.The movie is terribly miscast. Basically all of the archaeological roles, are terribly miscast and no one is believable enough in their roles. There are some good actors in this movie but they are however not suited for their roles in this movie. Because of the odd casting choices, we also never really get to care, or know the characters well enough. The movie also lacks a good real main villain, with some clear motivations.In a time when we are accustomed to movie fights like in ""Gladiator"" or the Lord of the Rings movies, you have to come to the simple conclusion that the fight sequences in ""Timeline"" are a disappointment. The scene's are relatively cheap looking and lack a sense of scale.The movie isn't bad looking and there are still some good scene's though. Also the musical score by Brian Tyler was a good one, even though I would had still prefer Jerry Goldsmith of course.Not entertaining enough and the story and characters fully prevent this movie from being a good one.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Timeline
9,view_and_review,$80M on this Crype,2,28 February 2021,"In ""Master and Commander"" (also released 2003) the French were the bad guys and the English the good guys. Rating: 7.4/10. In ""Timeline"" the English are the bad guys and the French are the good guys. Rating: 5.7/10. Correlation? I don't know, I didn't like either movie, but at least ""Master and Commander"" was a better production.I only watched ""Timeline"" because I like time travel movies; even the bad ones. This would qualify as a bad one. This time travel movie was different in that a company called International Technology Company (ITC) --I know, really creative-- discovered a wormhole that sent three-dimensional objects to 1357 Castlegard, France. That was never their intent. And it was doubly bad because this was a hotspot during the ""100 Year War"" (I missed that lesson in world history).An archaeologist named E.A. Johnston (Billy Connolly) went back to 1357 and got stuck. ITC then sent seven, count them, seven people back to get him. Was he that important? No, the movie just required extra bodies for more drama: deaths, love interests, splitting up, etc. The seven people that went back for him were his son Chris (Paul Walker), female archaeologist (hence love interest) Kate (Frances O'Connor), male archaeologist Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), French translator Francois (Rossif Sutherland), ITC employee Gordon (Neal McDonough), and two nameless ex-Marines.This blundering movie failed as a sci-fi, failed as a time travel movie, and failed as a romance. This made-for-TV-movie had SyFy Channel original written all over it, that's why I can't believe it had an $80,000,000 budget. They had very few rules for their temporal journey and one of the rules was not to bring any modern weapons. Well, nameless temporal traveller number one brought a grenade. He screwed up and blew up the ""time machine."" That was all that was needed to artificially create more drama.Like any bad time travel movie, the time travelers created all kinds of waves in the timeline. This really should've been a comedy these ""scientists"" had such little regard for history. In the middle of this terrible adventure Kate and Chris predictably fall in love and the time travelers play a critical role in the Castelgard battle. I got a little over half way through the movie before bailing. There was nothing of interest for me to continue watching. This was another Hollywood big budget turd that they make just because they can.",Timeline
10,neil-476,Aghast time-travel fan pokes holes,6,31 August 2006,"There are two types of time travel story. One type (let's call it Type A) says that if you change something in the past, the consequences of that change ripple forward in time, Butterfly Effect-style, so that the present you return to is changed. Type B says that anything you do in the past has already happened and is already reflected in the present you left and return to although, for dramatic reasons, you may not realise it until you return. Logic dictates that the two types cannot co-exist.Timeline tries to have its cake and eat it too.Lady Claire's death at the hands of the English is the galvanising event which led the French to victory we are told, before anyone goes back in time. By saving her life past events are changed, although the greatest (possible) Butterfly Effect-type change we notice is the inscription on the sarcophagus when our heroes eventually return - this is a Type A time travel story. Yet the sarcophagus existed before they left, complete with effigy of one-eared soldier who turns out to be the chap who stayed behind. This is a Type B story.Having the two together is cheating! Possibly this is no more than a time-travel story fan's geekish quibble. Putting it to one side, the film is a tolerable yarn, full of action and with science fiction trimmings. The book is better, if a little heavy in science fiction technical gibberish, mostly useful for finding reasons as to why some of the more obvious ""Well why don't they...?"" questions (as asked by my wife every time we watch a film) aren't possible. By omitting that gibberish, in the interests of speeding everything up, the film presented my wife with a good half hour of questions which the book circumvented.",Timeline

12,mm-39,What can I tell you this movie is awful,4,25 April 2004,"Spoiler I mentioned this movie is awful here is a few reasons.  The acting and budget is ok, but there is no way to cover the bad story.  These dudes go back in time to retrieve another historian.  Problem, besides draged out story line, useless dialog, and unbelievable actions of the cast, is the cast does everything possible to destroy the time line. (maybe they could have include necular weapons into the story)  I was waiting for a parallel universe to happen where the future is change ie the Butterfly Effect; doesn't happen and no time line ulteration weakens this story.  Wouldn't having a historian being left behind be the most dangerious option for time travel.  The guy would become another psyhchic reader who could greatly ulter the future.

13,dromasca,Disney-level entertainment (meaning bad),5,12 April 2004,"It is such shameful to see a book of one of the best science-fiction writers today being turned into plain stupid family entertainment venture. Michael Chrichton's books are often about the moral implication of science, about the mis-use of science for capitalist profit. Using smart setting, humor and catching action they are pageturner and convey real messages. The cinematic pace of the action resulted in many good films, but this is not the case here.  'Timeline' may not be one of his best books, the plot in the book has some holes of itself but it still has the author mark, is complex and the characters are more than simplistic sketches in the film version. The film is almost as bad as most of the Disney Studios  movies are. Some decent acting by Billy Connolly is not enough to save the day.

14,MLDinTN,Be wary of any movie that makes the French the good guys,3,13 July 2005,"Timeline is a badly written sci-fi film. This corporation has invented a time warp that only takes you back to a specific date in history, which is when the French triumph over the English at this castle. Why the time warp only goes to this particular time still doesn't make sense to me. So, Chris's dad gets stuck in history so Chris and his friends including the girl he crushes on, go back to rescue him.. They wear these necklaces that tell the time they have before they must come back. One of their friends is French so that doesn't go over too well when they are captured by the English.Many of the actions are silly, but what I really thought was ridiculous was having the French speak English. They said some things in French with subtitles. I mean, the French hated the English and wouldn't lower themselves by speaking English all the time.Then there was the silly romance between Marek and the French chick. Like he couldn't find anyone from his own time.FINAL VERDICT: It was all too corny and a bad story line. Plus the fights were terrible.

16,tabuno,"Good Effort, Compelling Movie",6,25 January 2019,"27 November 2003. The movie adaptation grabbed me much more than the book. The images, the sights, and sounds really solidified into reality when brought to the screen and the compressed timeline made for a more intense experience without overlooking the human element. The most brilliant scene is a matter of a look, an expression on Claire's face when she encounters honor and chivalry, and bravery of another. Unfortunately, the movie in order to capture a larger audience glosses over the language barrier and sticks to the simpler time travel as opposite to the multi-universe theory of quantum foam. But the ancient battles and strategy, the weapons of war were well captured even more so than ""Excalibur."" The movie was solid not so much because of the performances, the acting, but the script, the light humor that the book left out. As with the book, the lack of modern-day thinking used in the past didn't fire up any large contrasts, the supporting characters get killed off in a rather unlikely fashion. But this adaptation of the novel was great and really brought alive the rather slim story descriptions offered in the book. This is a compelling and commendable effort to bring the collision of the past and future and alternative universes into better focus with an entertaining and enjoyable vehicle. Seven out of Ten Stars.Updated. As a movie on reflection, the period set and design and action is gripping and compelling, yet for a sci fi time travel movie it presents serious flaws and missed opportunities. The script plots seem manipulative and the use of future knowledge and military tactics and/or martial arts seems very weak. Overall, this movie doesn't really meld the period of history with the future travelers very well and it would have been a better movie almost to have excluded the time travel plot in the first place ironically.

They have to try even harder now to go back to present something that is very difficult since their time machine has some problems and some conflicts and interests come in front that might lose their window of returning.I have to admit that I had high hopes for this movie because I had seen the trailer and also the cast. I was a bit disappointed by it but I enjoyed it. It's an average - good movie just to spend your time and nothing more, it has an interesting plot with some exaggerations that I found a bit annoying but it's a good afternoon movie. I liked the interpretation of Gerard Butler who played as Andre Marek and in my opinion, he was the best in this movie. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Anna Friel's who played as Lady Claire and Billy Connolly's who played as Professor Johnston. About the direction which was made by Richard Donner I believe that it was average because there were some very boring points in the movie that it would be good if there were speed up a little since there weren't so important.To sum up, I have to say that ""Timeline"" isn't a bad movie just an average with an interesting plot and with some good interpretations made by its cast.

20,Anonymous_Maxine,Never underestimate the importance of release forms!!,8,4 December 2003,"Speaking of time travel, there is an interesting paradox that seems to surround movies that involve time travel (The Time Machine (namely the remake), Timeline, Time Cop (for obvious reasons, admittedly), etc), in that no one seems to like them but they keep getting made. Well, maybe no one likes them but me. I can't get enough. I think that the fact that their popularity seems to exist only among filmmakers (and me), and not the general public, is more a symptom of sci-fi in general. Science fiction is one of the two easiest genres to be badly screwed up (the other, needless to say, being horror), with a massive quantity of awful movies being made for every one good one that comes along, and a massive number of good ones for every great one. So do the math. The great movies are not common. 
I would say that one of the main reasons that these movies are generally not too well accepted, especially science fiction ones involving time travel, is that any amount of time travel involves a certain perspective on the world (pertaining to time travel in the past), while time travel into the future involves a certain imagination of what the future will look like, and that vision is not likely to be very similar to your own vision of the future. Hence the common dislike. I, on the other hand, get a huge kick out of seeing other people's imagination about what the future will hold, which is why I tend to enjoy time travel films so much. There are exceptions, however, such as the fact that the people who made the 2002 version of The Time Machine seem to have a massive misunderstanding of the mechanics of evolution (both of organic life as well as the evolution of the language spoken by the creatures 800,000 years in the future), but for the most part, I think time travel movies are not assertions of what the future will look like, but a more direct approach to the very basic function that all movies are meant to create  escapism. What better way to escape the routine of daily life than by going to a completely different time?That being said, I'd like to take this opportunity to defend Timeline, because scanning through the other reviews on the IMDb is enough to reveal that there are a lot of people out there who didn't appreciate it as much as I did. Roger Ebert was certainly less than impressed. Okay, so I could have done without Paul Walker, who hasn't been in a good movie since Pleasantville (I should say whose ONLY good movie was Pleasantville), but the overall premise and execution of the film I found to be tons of fun. There is a lot of talk about nothing interesting being done with the premise, and while I can't say that I completely disagree, it also doesn't completely bring the movie down.True, there are millions of possibilities that the movie could have explored, and it only explored maybe five of them, but they were still fun. For example, the actual experience of traveling through time (which I was very much looking forward to, given the fact that the travelers have to be broken down to a molecular level) is conveyed with nothing more than a series of underwater shots and a bunch of dissolves, very disappointing. Then there is the fact that so much could have been added had someone from the 14th Century been brought back to the present time, which would have been more interesting since they would not have had any idea what was going on, unlike the scientists. But I guess that was already done in Kate & Leopold, another movie that I genuinely enjoyed but that received lukewarm reviews. There was a very interesting event involving someone that snuck a hand grenade back into the 14th Century (perhaps knowing that they were going to arrive right in the middle of a war), only to zap himself back in time after pulling the pin, just in time to destroy the machine that sent everyone back. This, unfortunately, is where the movie really starts to fall apart. We're told at the beginning that this machine has been able to fax actual, 3-dimensional objects from this machine to an `identical' one in New York City. The question that immediately arises, then, is why the hell don't they go to that machine to get the scientists back instead of furiously trying to repair the exploded one? (spoilers) Then, of course, you have the `villain' who ultimately refuses to allow even an effort to get the scientists back, since they only have the machine back to 81% performance when they begin to run out of time. Simply having the scientists sign release forms upon their departure would have solved that problem right away. They already knew that they sometimes had problems getting people back in the same condition in which they left, you would think that it would have been standard procedure. There is, of course, the question of ethics, but this guy was clearly more concerned about their resulting deformities `ruining us.' It was also pretty clever how they introduced a deadline into a movie involving time travel, by the way. There is nothing more frustrating than the characters rushing to get something done in a movie in which they can simply travel back further and have more time. This was one of the only things that bothered me a little bit about the Back to the Future movies, how Doc is always rushing around saying, `Damn! I'm late!' But I guess it's kind of like when you were a kid playing Nintendo and you used to get mad at the video game even though you had the Game Genie and had infinite lives. Come on, you had the Game Genie, didn't you??Anyway, in order to travel back in time in Timeline, they open up a wormhole, I guess in the space-time continuum or something, which only stays open for a certain length of time before closing again, and the people have to come back through the same wormhole that they left in. Hence the deadline and the opportunity to include one of those digital clocks counting down the time that Roger Ebert loves so much. Now, while the movie ignores tons of possibilities that could have been explored with the concept of time travel, I really liked the idea of the scientists themselves going back and thoroughly altering history, one of those things that mostly all time travel movies and books (even The Simpsons) before revel as the ultimate thing NOT to do when traveling through time, especially into the past. 
Not so here, the professor, first of all, is able to send a message back to the future in leaving a note and his glasses to be found 600 years later so that his contemporaries will know that he's in the past. They travel back and arrive right in the middle of a war, hence the widespread and justified complaints that the movies simply uses time travel as an excuse to stage some elaborate battle scenes. I can hardly argue with that, but due to my own undying love of time travel in the movies, I found much more beyond that to enjoy. It could have done so much more, but the entertainment value is hardly sacrificed.",Timeline

This annoying movie was the first one I saw at the cinema in 2004. I only went, cause some friends were going to see it, and I tagged along. Honestly there were times through this overlong film, watching it, a painful and straining process, I just wanted to leave. I expected this to be a science fiction, in space kind of film, not one of medi evil, so you can imagine my disappointment. It's very start had me excited, then... I expected more from director, Donner, who kind of had me thinking, has he lost the plot. The actors aren't at fault. They give it what they got, lead Walker, a bumbling mess of a performance, that's unconvincing. He's the oversexed son, would you believe of archaeologist, Connely. Bumbling jock, Walker's character, Chris, an avid inventor, only has eyes for Oz's Francis's O'Connor, who's too occupied in her work to care. Walker's scenes kind of do come as a compensation as in what is a slow, dull, 111 minute film, where honestly you want to turn off. When Connelly, is somehow transported 600 years back to medieval times, it's up to Walker (who's acting here, does boost up) and his colleagues to travel back in time and rescue the father. Timeline came as such a disappointment, shamefully wasting so more good actors. Medieval pics like these, to me are only good if they have a lot of gore, and much more is at stake. Timeline's problem painfully lies in the plotting and it's mostly flat journey of too much screen time wasted, and especially the latter of my last sentence. We don't care here, but more so, this formula and story is so old hat, it's quite easy, to lose focus here. Again Mr Donner needs a good talking to.

Good casting with Paul Walker even though he failed to deliver an exciting role. Done. Now onto the negatives which would never end if I had the time. First of all the acting from everyone including Paul Walker was the worst, most boring, tired, ever from these actors. It was like none of them had wanted their roles, but Richard Donner (director) had held a gun to them and forced them to take the role. Either that or they accepted before reading the script. Second their was way to much talk and when some action came along, well let's just say if you didn't know what was going to happen then you don't watch a lot of movies. The movie never should have even been considered to be made, with such a week storyline and all the soppyness the book had in it. Bottom line is if anyone reads the sypnosis on the back cover of the DVD/video and is excited about the movie well their are a lot of freshly painted houses out there just waiting for you to go and watch the paint dry on.",Timeline

Well, I think the answer is not any of that; it's ALL of that together!

24,dfranzen70,Icky-bad.,2,27 April 2004,"In the pantheon of gosh-awful movies, Timeline isn't quite as bad as, say, Showgirls, but only because its deficiencies are hilarious when viewed with the correct perspective.First, one must consider that the movie is based on the Michael Crichton book of the same name. Okay, that's usually a blessing; I believe people are more likely to go to a movie if Crichton's name is attached to it. Think Jurassic Park, Disclosure, Coma, and so on.Then consider that the director is the skilled Richard Donner, the auteur who brought us the Lethal Weapon movies. Since Timeline is supposed to be a sci-fi/action/thriller, he seems like a good choice, right?But oh, the troubles! How can I count them all in a compact way that won't bore you? It won't be easy, but trust me on this: It'll be easier than your sitting through Timeline.If you're expecting this movie to be an adaptation of the novel, you'll be disappointed. The most basic outline of the plot remains (young excavators travel to 14th century to rescue professor), but so much has been changed. Now, it's not uncommon for a screenwriter to make changes that he or she feels will make the story more cinematic, and sometimes these changes even make sense within the book's storyline. Here, for some reason, one of the youngsters attempting to rescue Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) is his son Chris (Paul Walker). In the book, Chris was an archaeologist who was forever pining after one of the rich local French ladies. Did the screenwriter feel a stronger bond between Chris and the professor was necessary? Weird. But leaving the plot changes aside, the performances were wildly awful, almost universally. Walker, who's been decent in such movies as Varsity Blues and The Fast and the Furious, comes off as completely clueless here as Chris, even though the character was pretty bright in the book. Walker delivers each line in a weird, nonchalant surfer drawl, leaving me to finish each of his lines with a ""dude."" ""Okay, I like, don't know where we are, but I think we're like, lost. Dude."" You see what I mean? What was he even doing in this movie? Chris is supposedly Johnston's son, but his is a distinctly American accent (Connolly, of course, has a very thick Scottish brogue). This may have been explained in an early scene, but I had already settled into full mocking mode by then.The others are no better. Frances O'Connor plays Kate, a skilled climber. We know she's a skilled climber because she reminds us in practically every scene she's in! ""Someone has to climb on this roof and drop down to the other side!"" ""I'll do it! I am the best climber here!"" Yes, you go. Go, Kate, go. She was so busy proving how wonderful she was that she forgot to turn in a nuanced performance. But that's okay, because her character was as well developed as a Polaroid print two seconds after it's been taken.To be fair, nearly every character is nothing more than a cardboard cutout, a caricature of Good or Bad, Strong or Weak. It's like the screenwriter had just taken his first creative writing class and hadn't gotten around to learning how to flesh out his characters. But Connolly as the professor? Why? Because he's Scottish, of course. A Scotsman digging in France with Americans and Englishmen. Maybe the filmmakers felt Connolly was able to evoke a sense of authority; if so, they miscalculated miserably. Connolly was as strong as a wet kite in a ferocious wind. So, to recap, the writing was awful, the acting was pathetic, and the direction was suspect. Oh, and the casting was subpar.
As I mentioned, I mocked this movie freely. Luckily enough, I was watching it at home, where the only other living creature save the roaches was the dog, and he was mocking right along with me. I was quite happy that I hadn't spent the money to see this in the theater and was therefore able to make fun of the movie in the comfort of my own home. The screenwriter should be ashamed to have changed so many details from the book, because the changes didn't help things (and often confused the plot further for those who had read the book) and were wholly unnecessary, to boot. But don't worry, Michael Crichton fans! The failure of this movie won't prevent the adaptation of further Crichton books; there's a Jurassic Park IV on the horizon.",Timeline

26,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Fun stuff,7,18 July 2016,"I really enjoyed Richard Donner's Timeline, despite some bad reviews and an awful reputation. It's based on a book by the great Michael Crichton, and centers around what is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable premises out there: time travel. There's nothing like a time travel flick, in any way, shape or form. I'm a sucker for them. This one starts off with an archaeological dig somewhere in England, leading to the abrupt discovery of forces that allow a wormhole in time to be used, sending people back to the middle ages. Paul Walker discovers that his researcher father (Billy Connolly) has made the leap back in time, and may be in trouble. Along with his sort of girlfriend (Frances O Connor) and his father's friend (Gerard Butler) they venture back to find him, and of course everything goes wrong. They land smack in the middle of a skirmish between a poncy English lord (Michael Sheen) and the leader of the French faction (Lambert Wilson), with no identities, nothing to defend themselves with and not a clue what to do. Back home in our time (or, rather, 2003. Time flies, don't it?), the head of the program responsible for harnessing the wormhole's power (a slimy David Thewlis) is a greedy prick who can't really be trusted with the technology, prompting the suspicion of his assistant (Matt Craven). Walker, Butler and company are now faced with a full on castle siege that's quite the dandy set piece, forced to take up arms and fight for their lives as well as a way home. Walker is amusingly out of place in a medieval setting but it works considering the plot. Butler is terrific, bringing his old world style to a character arc that is lovely to see play out. Connolly, although not in the film that much, lights up the screen with his genial kindness and likability that he brings to every film. Neal McDonough, Anna Friel and Marton Csokas also costar. It's simply an adventure piece that doesn't think logistics too much, and in turn doesn't require you to do so either. Underrated stuff.",Timeline

The same professor that just went on a trip some days ago! The team discovers that the professor has been able to go back in time through a wormhole, to Castlegart during a decisive battle between England and France. Now they must go after him and rescue him!Now, time-travel is tricky business. Not only because it has never been done (to my knowledge anyway :) ) so the technical aspects to explain how it is done is hard to make believable. Then there is the problem with messing up history, making a coherent story and plot hard to make. But if you manage to pull it of, it has great potential. So, in my opinion, it is very brave to make an attempt on a movie based on time-travel.Here is a try, but unfortunately I must say they failed. I know that as a viewer, one should accept some implausible and fantastic explanations, especially in a genre like this. And as I like this genre I'm willing to stretch pretty far, but this movie contained a few to big ""holes"" that made this movie fail.First, it is utterly predictable from the start (For example, take the painting leading to the tunnel, now who would ruin such a beautiful painting? Take a guess). Therefore, there is no suspense really in the plot, other than to see if the movie actually recovers potentially plot holes and manage to pull it off. Therefor the entire sub plot which takes place now, which only serves to create a time limit on the traveling team, become just annoying and we would have been better off without it. If a time limit was deemed necessary it could have been created differently, for example the wormhole the travel through is unstable and is predicted to collapse within... Then there are some technical problems. How does the ""markers"" work. I didn't find anyone actually attempting to explain that, and they are a major part of the plot. And the few explanations given was contradictory. As I understood it, activating one marker should bring the whole team back but that obviously didn't happen when markers were activated. The there are the wormhole itself. It is explained, once again as I understood it, to be leading to specific time and place. So when the team enters the wormhole to go searching for the missing professor, shouldn't they arrive on top of him since the wormhole was fixed in time?The actors did their work however there really wasn't any ""chemistry"" in the relationships present (father son, love...). It was nice to see some expense and effort had been made to battle scenes (the armies consisted of more than ten men) and costumes, building and so on...

In fact, the whole cast give average performances with the exception of Paul Walker, who is just dire in any movie and has all the on-screen charisma of a Thunderbirds puppet.The timetravel scenario here has our heroes travelling back to rescue Connelly, who has got himself stuck in time. Naturally, when attempting a rescue, you have to send a couple of ""real"" soldiers along, in case things get rough. Also naturally, these ""soldiers"", in true Star Trek-Red Shirt fashion, get killed virtually immediately and so are less than useless.There are lots of ""hmmmmm....."" moments, even for someone not well versed in medieaval history. The Greek Fire was my favourite - we're to believe that Connelly's character is not only an historian, but also an accomplished chemist as well. Yeah right.Not the least puzzling is where the money went that they put into this film. The costumes look like something out a cheap amateur dramatics stage play, there are very few special effects and no big name actors to soak up the cash. Everything looks more like a TV movie than a big budget production, right down to the Frenchies speaking perfect, modern English when pushed to it.If you just let the movie wash over you and really make an effort to not look too hard, then this movie is an OK way to spend an hour or two.

The beginning was sort of thrown together. I doubt people would agree to just step into a wormhole on a moments notice. Several characters were interesting but undeveloped. Who is Decker? The English Duke Oliver - what is he about - seemed like a good villain, but vary little depth?

For Donner, a journeyman director with several top-notch entertainments under his belt, this is hopefully the nadir.

With costumes borrowed from a traveling Renaissance Festival and actors borrowed from the local community theater, even the brainless idiocy of ""From Justin To Kelly"" reads like Citizen Kane when weighed against this bone-chilling waste of resources which could have gone towards fueling that political lie of making hunger a memory in Africa.From the modern-day blue-tinted laboratory (replete with grailed platforms, flat-screen monitors which display nothing but cack and things that sparkily go ""bzzz"" when they explode), to the chain-mailed medieval riders (wielding unwieldy swords and speaking in modern English accents), to the populace of 14th-century France (outfitted in clean rags and milling aimlessly everywhere for atmosphere), every aspect of this movie simply oozes INAUTHENTIC like a Burt Reynolds hairpiece. The appalling acting doesn't help.Notably pathetic in her role is Frances O'Connor, who performed spectacularly as the troubled mother in ""A.I: Artificial Intelligence"", yet who has forgotten how to stop ""indicating"" in this movie  her every move an overt caricature of an emotion, like an acting student who has just learned how to ""not look at the camera"".Paul Walker, who held up well as a supporting actor alongside the talented Steve Zahn and the delectably sweet Leelee Sobieski in ""Joy Ride"", cannot seem to inhabit his ""leading man"" role here with any conviction, as his on-screen presence is constantly overpowered by any day-player, mule or piece of rock which accidentally shares the screen with him.For Billy Connolly, this is one of those roles that he wished he'd never accepted.Written by Michael Crichton (whose stories have become as hit-and-miss as Stephen King's when translated to the movie screen), the plot centers around some boring English-French war in 1347, into the middle of which modern-day archaeologist Billy Connolly is dropped accidentally, for the sole purpose of having his archeology students and his shiftless son travel back in time to attempt a rescue. Usually, when this plot device is utilized, the modern-day protagonists exploit their elevated knowledge of history and technology to bode them through the adversity of their escape from the ""past"". In this piece, that involves time-traveling amulets which never work  and lots of running. And PLENTY of unbelievably deplorable acting from Frances O'Connor.While one of the character actors is tripping over his line-read trying to convince us that he's not talking PURE bull (but merely a watered down version thereof) regarding the ""time-machine"" and worm-holes, Paul Walker actually says, ""Personally I don't care about the hows and the whys""  and we realize that neither do the film-makers. Immediately, all attempts at explanations regarding the machine's logistics cease and the time-machine is relegated to a McGuffin.To inspire some shred of dramatic tension (which could not be culled from the inane characters alone) the machine delivers Our Heroes back to the Middle Ages (via the process of fallacious physics) and then promptly blows up, due solely to the WELL-TRAINED MARINE whose first act when stepping out in medieval France was to present himself as an easy target to a bowman, then teleport back with a grenade conveniently about to explode. The OTHER Well-Trained Marine was killed even quicker. Yeh - semper fidelis, my foot! In a movie like this, when the protagonists' only means of escape is destroyed, there is not one shred of doubt that, by the time the ""ticking clock"" has reached the final few seconds, some OTHER specious plot device will come into play to BRING THEM BACK safely. And it does, due to their whining geek physics pal.Every so often the movie flashes back to ""the present""; to the destroyed lab where all the character actors ineffectually bicker over how to reconstruct the time-machine, taking opposing sides simply to create dramatic tension, rather than because they really know what they're talking about, and also to lend gravity to the ""ticking clock"", which we don't really care about once Frances O'Connor takes the screen again to pain us with more abysmal ""acting"".At a certain point, this movie becomes unwatchable. It is pointless to describe banal plot contrivances and indescribably vapid acting performances when the movie is literally glutted with both. And one of the biggest surprises is  it's Richard Donner at the helm! This is the director behind ""The Omen"", ""Superman"", ""Lethal Weapon"". What drove him to this low state? Did he really think that the generational draw-card of Paul Walker would hold up the indolent story and lackluster directing, not to mention the unmentionably insensate acting of Frances O'Connor? Then there's the French woman who seemingly can't hold onto any particular accent, and who FOR NO REASON disguises the fact that she can speak fluent English until the laziness of the plot makes it convenient for her to do so.Have I mentioned that Frances O'Connor's acting makes Hayden Christensen look like Sir Lawrence Olivier? The titular ""timeline"" has nothing at all to do with ANYTHING, as these characters in no way seem concerned about altering history for better or worse. As far as we can see, they have no stake in anything except transporting Billy Connolly back to the present, all the while arguing over their time-amulets and shushing each other, whilst a silly and lazily-directed war that doesn't concern them in the least roils around them.Oh, did I fail to describe Frances O'Connor's dung-heap of a performance? With his talent for bringing out the absolute NON-actor in human beings, even George Lucas could not have made her performance any more stilted, stunted, immature and uninformed.Time travel should exist for the sole purpose of being able to go back and stop this movie from being green-lighted.Night Arrows!!(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)",Timeline

The film is no more interesting or clever than a two hour long episode of the old Sci Fi series ""Sliders"", and at least in Sliders, you could differentiate the characters. Timeline is my least favorite of Michael Crichton's projects, and, more objectively, probably his worst film.A group of archaeologists obsessed with medieval France find themselves connected to a corporation experimenting with time travel, and must go back to rescue one of their number from the very period they are studying. OK - we suspended disbelief for Jurassic Park because we wanted dinosaurs to clone from a couple of nanograms of degraded DNA of an insect that evolved several million years after their extinction - so why not? I am a professional archaeologist, and I sometimes teach paleontology in my earth science classes. So I can't be 100% objective about this, but on the other hand I can't avoid making the following comment. First - survival in my field requires having your head firmly rooted in the present. Second - the depiction of the time and place offered in this film is utterly outrageous - medieval people are depicted as hordes of competing psychopaths. Third - let's not even discuss the linguistic issues.My problem with this film isn't simply the extravagant, silly, and not very original plot. The script permits little character development, with the exception of Gerard Butler and Anna Friel's characters (and luckily for us, their acting is up to the challenges of their roles). While the acting is decent, there are times when the disinterested script trips the performances up and makes everybody look... well... at least mediocre.Bottom-line: This film is well photographed, has lots of action, some interesting (though absurd) sets, and a couple of likable characters, but is deeply injured by its lack of originality and poor character development.

Story, writing, acting, directing, production values; all passionless. It succeeded in being almost absolutely devoid of any excitement whatsoever. What was an actress of Frances O'Connor's caliber doing here? More importantly, why wasn't she acting? Remember Jurassic Park? Sam Neill's reaction when he first sees the big dinosaur? He's so wonderstruck that his legs can't carry him; he falls on his ass in sheer, gawking astonishment. THAT's a reaction!! The archeologists in Timeline, however, upon hearing that they can be sent back in time, hardly bat an eyelash. They hardly do more than stand around shrugging! Same thing once they've actually gone back to 1357! They hardly bother to even look at the sights around them (well, they do, but not at first, when the impression is at its most potent)! It's ridiculous! Like I said, passionless. Nobody involved with this movie appeared to care about it. The story is a tiny one, revolving around a couple of cheap sets. Historical research is an unknown concept. No effort was made to make the language of the 14th century even slightly authentic. And of course the timeline is inconsistent. Before they leave for the past, they see traces of *both* their original past (which they change) *and* the effects of what they haven't changed yet! *GOD*, the people who write these things are morons!Anyway, the movie had one thing to like. Anna Friel. When I went to see it, I didn't even know she was in it, but it was a very positive surprise (since I'm a big fan of hers). She was the one person who took her role seriously. Unlike the others, *she* was believable in her setting. Because of her, I give this movie 4 out of 10, instead of 3.(Yeah, I mean, it was pretty awful, but it does deserve more than a 1 or a 2.

As other IMDb'ers have mentioned, character genders and ages are changed willy-nilly, major plot lines are hacked away or otherwise butchered, motivations and relationships are drastically altered, and the neat little ending involving Marek is telegraphed right from the beginning. Even the nature of the ""time travel"" involved has been changed. This is a terrible film that only gets as high a rating as it does from me by virtue of its reasonably decent production values and cinematography. If you enjoyed the book, avoid this one at all costs. It will only irritate and sadden you.

Like nearly all the reviewers here, I was hoping for more.  The complex setting of the time travel gimmick of the book is reduced to a worm hole and the rest of Crichton's marvelous historical details get crammed into a great leap of poetic license which adds to the deterioration of the story.  Alas, we're left with too many loose ends and have to swallow so much on faith and, for those of us who are historical mavens, to look the other way while the principals are speaking modern English and French-- neither one of which obviously existed in the time period.

The reason: Walker's father, played by Billy Connolly, had stumbled upon a wormhole through the time/space continuum, and became trapped in the Middle Ages. There is some suspense, which comes from various elements: attacking English knights, worries about damaging the process of time, and other dangers.

44,oOoBarracuda,a Timeline best to be left alone,1,15 January 2016,"I'm not one of those movie watchers that all too often states, after a disappointing movie, ""Well that was two hours of my life wasted."" I always felt that phrase was thrown in a flippant way by half- hearted movie goers. I may have to change my tune after watching Timeline. I have been searching and I just can't find much of anything positive to say about this movie. The benefit of watching a lot of movies is of course seeing great films, especially ones you may not have seen otherwise. The downside to this formula is that the more movies you see, the higher your chances exist of seeing a movie that is just dreadful.Timeline involves a group of archeology students, their professor, and his son. Their goal is to erect and use a 3-D fax machine to transport objects to different places and times. With this tool, they attempt to time travel. When our lovable professor, Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) finds himself in 1357 France, it is up to his team of students, led by his son Chris Johnston (Paul Walker). What was supposed to be a simple retrieval and return to the present turned into a disaster with the team nearly being stranded in the middle of a war. When the lead of the team is killed, the inexperienced time hoppers are left to their own devices to try and get home safely, with only a limited amount of time to do so. One of the team members, Andre Marek (Girard Butler) finds love while in France, and decides to stay leaving his team in shock. Eventually, they make it back, with the professor, vowing never to time travel again.What could have been a great story was bogged down by poor acting, disjointed story-telling, and needless explanation. It's a time travel movie and at this point time travel is impossible, the audience understands this before the movie even begins, there is no need to explain to me the how the method of time traveling is working in the movie. I am quite comfortable with the suspension of disbelief it takes to enjoy a movie, had the director respected the audience more and cut down on the explanation, it could have been a more enjoyable experience. Cutting down the lengthy explanation probably wouldn't have made much of a difference though as the acting was far from good. Having never been a fan of Paul Walker or Girard Butler, I shouldn't have expected much from the acting in this film. Both of them were unbelievable in their character, and even though the story revolves around a group of time travelers, the group themselves lacked any chemistry. Even the love stories of the film lacked any passion to lend to their credibility.There was also absent a character in this film that one could root for. There was no one engaging in this film to grab the audience's attention. Timeline proves that a well-shot film will need more than looking good to be good. I am told by fans of the book, that the filmmakers took too many liberties with this film, perhaps which lends to my dislike of it, though having never read the book, because it is just too far out. With no good acting to experience again, a horrible story, and a poorly done far-fetched concept, the only thing I can be sure about Timeline is that I will never see it again.",Timeline

He wrote Westworld, the story of a pleasure park where the man made attractions go wild and rebel against their human captors. Do I have to go on? Sounds like the sequel, and the Jurassic Park movies? Sure he's done different things since, but that really stuck with me and bugged me to the point of not watching his movies or reading his books.It would be great at this point to say I've been turned since watching this movie, but I can't. Not that the movie is the same story, there are similar moralities to it, but that it's not that great. The story is clumsy and character decisions are weak, a large part of it is very much stock plot and whatever could be deemed as new and inventive just seems to plod along and doesn't really have the depth to it.What I did like was the editing. Skipping back and forth between the times was well done, and just at the right moments to add tension, but everything just seemed destined to happen. When you should have been sitting wondering what they were going to do and how, you already knew or had a fair idea, and it just seemed to happen.The big battle scene was incredibly well done, and along with the sound editing made for some mighty seat leaping moments. Yet I keep coming back to the bad points, and I can't get past them.Billy Connolly was awful in this, and that's strange because he's been so good in other movies. Some of the other casting was flat and uninspiring, with Neal McDonough playing the same character he did in Boomtown. However, Gerard Butler was good, and I'm not just saying that, he was.

Surfer dude and some kind of European Barbara Hershey.I loved the concept, but I could not follow the plot in the action. The war is between France and England and these people are neither French nor English. So why was everyone trying to kill them? Mistaken identity? They weren't wearing battle gear.The idea of changing the course of history seems to be a separate issue from finding their professor and getting back home. But I guess you are supposed to believe that the whole thing was meant to happen.

This film really should have been played tongue in the cheek or in a Saturday Matinée serial style. The film begins with the obligatory scientific types in the laboratory explaining the whizz bangs (usually spoken in dreary monotones with bad sound and fixed camera to give the kiddies time to get popcorn and finish queuing for the restroom). The lead scientist or corporate head is the villain - boo hiss! The young students then gleefully step into the time machine with almost no hesitation and after arriving in France during the hundred years war, get picked off one by one until only the most handsome are left. The plot is ludicrous - the acting is worse. There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a tank through. One character is taken along because he speaks fluent French! I am sure that the French spoken in 1357 would have been as unintelligible to modern ears as would spoken English (try reading Chaucer) but the characters seemed to understand each other perfectly, although the Scottish accents were noticed.Aside from the characters running around like excited children who have just been let out of school, my biggest problem was that the plot had gaps as if important explanations had been left out. Why, for example, were they so desperate to get Becker back, and why had he made so many trips? I would have thought one trip to 1357 was enough. This, after all, was the time of the Black Death. I wanted to see more of the scientists and find out exactly what it was they were covering up. Maybe the book explained it, but the film didn't. I also thought that the film, or book, sacrificed plot in favor of slam bang action.

Timeline follows form and takes readers into a place where time travel is possible through wormholes and other science fiction type methods. Too bad the movie just takes the audience back into a dumb action movie. That's someplace we've been to a lot, and some of us don't want to be back. There are so many ideas yelling to be capitalized on here that it's a HUGE disappointment when director Richard Donner leaves us there, wanting more, but not getting it.

Somehow, some people are sent back in time, and it's up to our hero, Paul Walker, to bring them home. People who are interested in the 14th century fear going back in time when you'd think they would relish it. It's like a weatherman not being interested in chasing tornadoes.

So as I've never read the book, my expectations won't be too high. They weren't, and so I am relatively unscathed. I won't go out of my way to try to defend the film. I'll admit openly that it's pretty bad in terms of plot holes that are so big you could put a medieval castle in any one of them and still have room for a few more.Nevertheless, the concept behind the plot is a good one, even if the execution isn't. The idea of someone vanishing and artifacts being discovered that belonged to him and have been dated to a time hundreds of years previously sets the tone for a mysterious adventure. Unfortunately, the plot illogicalities take over from there and what could have become a great tale, doesn't.Personally, the high point for me is Paul Walker; he's a gorgeous guy I fell in love with after seeing ""The Fast and the Furious."" and although he isn't a great actor, he can be good.

We are given a time machine that leads to 14th century France via wormhole. When an archeology professor is trapped after entering the time machine, the engineers behind the device feel that its necessary to send a rescue team, which includes several of his students.

The costume work, building design, and characterization was believable. I can't say exactly how historically accurate the set was, but it convinced me.The acting and dialog is mostly uninspired. The only real characters I cared for were killed off early (with the exception of the English and French lords). I suppose this is much like other Crichton novels and movies, but this time there is no provocative science to fall back onto.The film is indeed imperfect, but it was not horrible either. Maybe if I had read the book, I would have been disappointed at some lost potential.

He does not seem to fit into this film any more than the Fast & Furious movies, and his acting hasn't improved.  He's just not a believable hero.  Fortunately, great performances by the rest of the cast, particularly O'Connor and Friel, prevents him from interfering too much with a great story.Another element to look forward to is the beautifully shot scenery.  It and the sound FX even help to make up for the mediocre and over-mixed original score.",Timeline
67,filmbuff-36,"Dude, we're totally back in the Middle Ages! Heinous!",5,14 December 2003,"There's a reason why time travel has remained a staple of science-fiction for more than a  century - human beings will always be curious about the past as well as the future. To be able to fix past mistakes with the advantage of hindsight or to know what to expect in the years to come are basic human desires common to everyone.The producers of ""Timeline"" may have benefited from owning a time machine. If they had taken a ride in Marty McFly's DeLorean they might have been able to prevent the mistakes in casting and scripting and made something that lives up to the idea's potential.An archeological team led by Professor Edward Johnston (Billy Connolly) is excavating the ruins of Castlegard, site of a medieval battle between the French and the British during the Hundred Year War. Johnston's son Chris (Paul Walker) is visiting, a man not interested in the past but in getting closer to his father's assistant Kate Erikson (Frances O'Connor).Trouble arises when Professor Johnston goes to his benefactor, the International Technology Corporation, to get more funds and information about why they are so interested in Castlegard. When he does not return Chris, accompanied with Kate, historian and medieval weapons expert Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), physics expert Dave Stern (Ethan Embry) and Francois (Rossif Sutherland) head to the company headquarters to figure out where Johnston has gone.It seems ITC, lead by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis), has stumbled onto a worm hole that leads back to 1357 while trying to perfect teleportation. Professor Johnston went back to see the era first-hand but got stuck there, and now his students must go back to rescue him. However, there's a catch, the group must collect him in six hours, otherwise they'll be stuck in the 14th century forever.The movie could have been great had the filmmakers taken more time to examine its premise, but as it stands the plot is just mechanical. Once in the past the group just goes from one incident to another in a single-minded goal of rescuing Johnston.There is no moment of wonder at the medieval world or any insights that looking into the past might reveal to 21st century travelers throughout the film. The visitors' knowledge of the area and upcoming battle do indeed come in handy, but they use this information only to survive and not to learn anything worthwhile.The movie certainly looks good, with some fine attention to period details. The clothing and buildings look authentic, though the people inhabiting them are a bit cleaner then they would have been. The siege on the castle is also well filmed with trebuchets and catapults launching flaming bombs at Castlegard.However, for a movie about survival and battle, everything is handled apathetically. The characters seem to be going through the motions when delivering their lines and there isn't much tension in the fight scenes. It adds up to a boring action movie, and boring is one thing an action movie should never be.It's also funny to see a film so selective about being authentic, such as making it a point that modern people should not carry modern equipment with them to influence history, but having medieval characters speak modern versions of English and French. It's also a strange that the movie takes sides, portraying the English as evil tyrannts and the French as noble defenders of their home. In reality, both sides were ruthless during that era.As an actor, Walker comes off as a poor man's Keanu Reeves. You read that right - Walker makes Reeves look like a nuanced performer by comparison. He shouts lines with little conviction and acts like a dork through most of the film.In fact, with the exception or Butler's Marek, it seems like amateur night in the acting department. A scene where O'Connors' Kate breaks down crying will have people laughing. Even Embry, normally an okay actor, gives an unmoving performance. His character stays behind in the present and comes off as the ""self-righteous scientist"" who squares off against Thewlis' heartless business man, a typical feature of this movie type.Director Richard Donner once made great movies like ""Superman"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" but can't rescue this mess. It's been five years since he's done a movie, and he seems rusty. The camerawork and set design are both excellent though, and belong in a better movie.Like most stories by Michael Crichton, ""Timeline"" makes scientists into noble humanitarians and corporate heads into greedy slime to create artificial drama, and it comes off as exploitive pabulum that detracts from where the attention should be, on the action.Since the action isn't good, what's left is a story where the heroes cry, complain and act selfishly while the movie tries to convince us that they're intriguing characters we should care about. ""Timeline"" is a wholly forgettable experience, and memories of the movie will be teleported out of the minds of the audience not long after leaving the theater.Five out of ten stars. Just stick to the ""Lethal Weapon"" series Mr. Donner, and Mr. Crichton, please exhibit caution before letting another one of your novels be ruined with a horrible on screen versions (but then, you haven't had a good reputation of doing that).",Timeline
68,Uthman,Surprisingly good,7,18 April 2004,"I thought TIMELINE started out a bit shaky, but before long I was hooked by the story. The characters are very appealing, and the action never flags. Granted, as medieval action flicks go, this is no BRAVEHEART, but it's a solid 7/10 in my opinion. I have no idea why the typically savvy IMDB users rated it so low.It should be pointed out that the English language spoken in 1357 would not be understandable by any modern American other than a scholar of Middle English literature. Just glance over a little Chaucer (died 1400) to see how alien our mother tongue was 600 years ago. Also, keep in mind that this film was set before the Great Vowel Shift of the early 15th century, through which our language traded German-sounding vowels for the familiar modern forms. Crichton handled the language problem quite deftly in the novel. I wish the filmmakers had take a similar approach, rather than catering to the lowest common denominator.The DVD has three nice ""making of"" documentaries, on top of a very pretty transfer from film to digital, so I recommend TIMELINE without hesitation.",Timeline
69,rapt0r_claw-1,"An enjoyable film, nothing special.",7,8 August 2004,"It seems Crichton book-to-screen adaptations have gone downhill since ""Sphere,"" and although ""Timeline"" continues the trend, it remains a highly watchable story about time travel and fourteenth century Europe. Unlike the usual ""time machine"" of most other films, ""Timeline""'s contraption is instead a fax machine that destroys objects and reunites them at a different point. This contraption reminiscent of a 50s Duck Dodgers cartoon, messes up big time and opens a ""wormhole"" to 1357 Castlegard, France. An archeologist who studies Castlegard goes back in time and is lost. A group of his students and son time travel to 1357 to recover him.One major flaw in the screenplay is the doing away with of the parallel universes idea that Crichton exploited. The theory goes that the past, present and future are all occurring at the same time, each infitesimal span of time is its own little universe, except universes can't contact each other. Other times are floating all around us. This has been revealed through molecular studies. With a quantum computer of impossible size, you fax objects and people to other times. This is exactly what Robert Doniger and ITC have accomplished. This complex theory has been entirely done away with, leaving only the insignificant wormhole to fourteenth century France.
Even such heinous distortion of source material isn't enough to kill the film. One of its strengths is the manner in which events from the book are brought to screen: the gore level is upped, the precision of a beheading maximized, the death of a character made all the more cool and fun to watch. Yes. That's one of the better things about the picture. Morbidity. Back to story. There is an undue amount of distortion of the story for no apparent reason whatsoever. Why do you have to make Chris the professor's son? Worse, why keep mentioning their kinship AGAIN and AGAIN. We KNOW Chris is the professor's son!

No it doesn't do justice to the book and not all the actors are great, but there's a great sense of desperation throughout the film. The pacing is breakneck and the middle ages are depicted as brutal and ugly as they really were, unlike the romanticized accounts we usually get, i.e. ""Dragonheart"", ""First Knight"".Paul Walker, and if's there's a duller actor on earth let me know, plays Chris, son of a noted Professor who's gone missing in time. Specifically 14th century France. Why France? They really never explain it to us, but it looks convincing. He's accompanied by a tough history freak, the terrific Gerard Butler. his would-be girlfriend Kate, Fracois, their terrified interpreter and a marine and his two buddies. Beware the marine.The time-travel is plausibly explained here and the effect, if a bit of a letdown, are adequate. Once our heroes hit Castlegaurd France, 1357, things start to fly. Terrific fights, good swordplay and frequent flashback to the boneheaded scientists back home. Did I mention our heroes have only so much time to rescue the professor, an underused Billy Connelly, and get back home?The actions scenes here are really good, definitely the highlight of th film. there isn't much time for character development. Though there is a nice romance between Butler and Lady Claire. Their scenes are the best and the only one with any sort of humor. The rest of the film is played very seriously! Still I liked Timeline, is moves fast the baddies get their due, doesn't David Thewlis ever play a nice guy? And the heroes are actually heroic!!

The director fails to establish a decent rhythm or to get you to care about any of the characters.  Everything is loud and forced, with a bombastic music score to presumably help cover up the huge gaps in logic.  I have liked some of the actors in earlier roles, but I'm sorry to say none are shown to advantage here.  Frances O'Connor overacts all of her scenes at an intensity level about 10 degrees too high, becoming really irritating before the first 15 minutes have passed.  Paul Walker is so wooden and lackluster he makes the past standard bearer of bad actors, Keanu Reeves, look like Sir Alec Guinness.  I sure hope he's using some of the money he's raking in now to sign up for acting classes (and voice training!).

However, one can certainly sense the loss of plot.The movie is okay as an adventure/time travel film, if you simply like chases, stuff blowing up, fighting, etc. But there are also supposed to be several love stories which are ineffectively put in the film, especially between the main lead actor & actress, suddenly they are kissing and in love. Indeed there is probably way too much action, and not enough dialog or plot development.Even without having read the book, I felt while watching the film that the pointer scene was extremely rushed, empty, and unsatisfying. (In the DVD commentaries the director bragged about how they compressed that particular 150 pages of the book to five pages of script.)

Go to woods...This movie really could have been great. There is a creative premise about teleportation and a chance worm-hole. The topic of Mid-Evil warfare has certainly been robust enough to support films as diverse as Henry V and Les Visiteurs. The costumes and set design were superb, right down to the details of the English pikemen's helmets and the swinging baskets on the Trebuches. But none of that can excuse the script taken by the script into what is a lazy exercise in copy-paste writing. Not to mention the sloppy backstory about the prior time traveling done by ITC, the guy showing up unexpectedly in the dessert. The plot seems to skip along without much thought. Rules about no modern weapons (presumably to preserve history) don't get you much when the timetravellers take with them an utter disregard for killing, wiping out possible generations of future leaders or garbage men. The creative team on this film should hang their heads in shame.The love story also disappoints. The Chris-Kate romance is set up well enough with the scene between Chris and his dad. They give a very natural performance. And then we meet Kate: she's a wallflower archaeologist. No, wait, She's a no-hesitation marine. No, wait, ... But even the Kate's sketchy character beats Lady Claire, who looks like a French peasant throughout the film and shows no particularly quality that would explain Marek's devotion to her.

Like laughing in scenes you were supposed to feel sad about. Or, my favorite, playing ""spot the plot hole"". Mind you, most movies have at least some plot holes, but if they've distracted you with really good performances or a compelling plot or cool effects, then you ignore and forgive.Unfortunately for Timeline, there's nothing worthwhile going on so you're forced to entertain yourself by trying to imagine how such talented folks could spew such c-r-a- p. By the way, I have not read the book, so I must respectfully lump Crichton in with the rest of them.If you plan on renting (or gods-forbid, buying) this DVD, ponder these little gems (and yes, these could be considered SPOILERS):So how, exactly, did that fellow found in the desert at the beginning of the film get back to the present time? Don't you need that ""fax machine"" to time travel? Or did the wormhole conveniently open up and grab him? Riddle me that, Batman.Boy, those 14th century Englishmen sure did sound modern to me. I would hope that anybody with a high school level education would realize that people talked different back then. Even Shakespearean-era English is hard to follow, and that's a few hundred years after. Given the attention to detail to costumes and architecture, I should have hoped somebody on this project would have suggested adding at least a few ""thou""s, ""verily""s, ""hast""s and other King James-isms. (I don't speak French, but the French sounded too modern as well.)When asked if she's married, Claire, the French ""lady"" replies, ""We have been at war with the English since before I was born; there's no time for marriage."" Ok, so I guess the French stopped procreating for about a 100 years because they didn't have time? Or perhaps they decided that whole Catholic idea of no sex out of wedlock was just too impractical. Maybe this isn't exactly a plot hole, but it sure is a silly line.Notice that the first time travelers to get themselves killed are two ex-Marines. Two HIGHLY TRAINED SOLDIERS easily picked off by knights. Please. The surviving Marine then proceeds to see very little action and then succumbs to wimpering. I'm not buying it.And while I can understand said Marines smuggling weapons back in time, why a hand grenade? Wouldn't a hand gun provide more effective protection? Ah but then the filmmekers wouldn't have an excuse to blow up the time machine in a lame effort to add yet another layer of completely unnecessary suspense...And speaking of suspense, I don't understand why Donner (the director) felt the story needed to be propelled along by a never-ending string of artificially induced cliffhangers.To me, the compelling thing about time-travel movies is how they can show how alien the past or future is to our present. Even Back to the Future did a far better job of bringing a sense of wonder to the prospect of actually landing somewhere in the past.

Which it was, and you can trust the reviewers who claim the film is even more flawed.The tale shoehorns modern day archaeologists into 14th century France with a ludicrous - and very expeditious, by the way - explanation and set-up for time-travel. The first half hour of the film is so rushed that there is no time for the hapless characters to act awed by what they are experiencing, and therefore the film immediately loses credibility and impact. But, that is neither here nor there because true to Crichton's book, it is all just an excuse to manipulate a time-travel actioner.Woeful production values and direction further hinder this unbelievable farce, causing it to appear to be a lackluster made-for-TV movie with budget concerns.

The enormous ITC project has been rendered down to two blokes and a couple of mirrors where, if you make a squinty face and have a wind machine in your face it will apparently make you look like you are travelling through time. Jesus. David Thewlis as Doniger? Are you kidding? The book goes to such great lengths to educate but the screenwriter throws it all out the window. Knights practice with real swords in the book because they would never use mere wooden ones. So of course in the movie they're clacking away with wooden swords. And it just goes on and on.The cast overact as if they've never acted in their lives (Butler's moronic gawping is particularly annoying), everything is rushed and the twist of having another ITC employee already in the past in disguise is completely botched by him just telling them.I'm not one of these people who are never happy with the movie adaptation - this is simply a bad movie, period. Maybe if Donner had more faith in his audience and had turned in a realistic character adventure instead of an action movie for five-year-olds, things might have been different. Hard to believe this mess came from the guy who made Superman.Things do improve in the second half, with a huge battle, but this is mostly because the actors don't have to speak their awful dialogue as much.

But that doesn't mean the movie isn't fun though. It is based on the Michael Crichton's novel by the same name. Crichton is responsible for many great books, but is most known for Jurassic Park, which was famously adapted by Spielberg. With this being said you can definitely expect a story with a great premise. Timeline follows a group of archaeologists who are digging a site at Castleguard, France. They are funded by a technology company, ITC, and have been receiving hints about their site to the point where the boss, Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly), becomes suspicious. He goes to find out what the back story is and the next day his crew discovers a new room at the site which has a note left by the professor from 14th century France. The professor's son, Chris (Paul Walker), and the crew led by Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor) and Andre Marek (Gerard Butler) go to ITC to find out what is going on. They learn that the company built a 3d fax machine that tapped into a wormhole sending its packages, or in this case humans, back to 14th century Castleguard, France. The group then heads back in time to go save the professor, who was sent back there to figure out the connection of the wormhole and their site. While the film has a great premise it probably would have been a lot better if it was made ten years later with a bigger budget. The story starts off strong, but then proceeds to tail off into B-movie territory.

86,FloodClearwater,Solid Sci-Historical Stuff,7,2 October 2015,"Timeline, starring the late Paul Walker and Gerard Butler, and featuring a large and talented supporting cast, is an underrated film based on a very underrated book by sci-thriller master, the late Michael Crichton.This was always going to be a tricky film to make because the book's story is based on the sci-fi premise of time travel. The film preserves most of Crichton's brilliant plot--a tech firm in the American desert is trying to invent teleportation but stumbles into a wormhole that only sends the transported back in time to the year 1375 and a village in France during the brutal 100 Years' War.The actors making up the principle groups of story characters, the oily and secretive tech guys, the erstwhile archaeology students who get caught up in the tech guys' invention, and the, of course, late medieval English and French combatants the first two groups both travel back in time to encounter, are well-cast and well--directed by Richard Donner. Particular supporting role standouts here are Marton Csokas as Decker, David Thewlis as Doniger and Michael Sheen as 'Lord Oliver.' Anna Friel is perfectly medieval and ladylike yet attractively modern as Lady Clare, and Neal McDonough and Matt Craven post terrific performances as the wayward tech firm's henchmen.What gets left out from the book, what really has to get left out unless Donner et al were to pull a Peter Jackson and stretch Timeline into three films, is the trove of rich, textured, historical detail about virtually every aspect of the little French village and castle combination that the story circles around. The book is, indeed, better than the film, simply because Crichton's historical fiction writing work on all things 'Aquitainian' in Timeline equals or exceeds anything Bernard Cornwell or Tom Clancy have ever put out in terms of nourishing minutiae. But you can't competently get all that in inside a 2 hour film. With the exception of a few scenes where a character here and there is ""run through"" with a broadsword, Timeline is almost a family- friendly film, something that young people and the mature crowd can enjoy together. Almost, parents, screen it first. Most Crichton fans have never heard of or read Timeline, and most Richard Donner, Paul Walker, and Gerard Butler fans have never seen this very solid little 2003 film. Hopefully those oversights are rectified as time moves forward, because Timeline is an underrated film based on a very underrated book, and that means it deserves an audience.",Timeline

88,youngsteve,Travesty of a film,2,12 June 2016,"I first watched this film around four years ago, and it seemed an OK historical actioner with SF elements which passed the time. I had heard that the film deviated wildly from the novel & was not liked, so I finally got around to reading it, & now viewing the film again agree totally with the criticisms. The plot not only deviates wildly, but makes little sense, & contains laughable acting throughout.In the book the two female characters are two of the strongest in it, & both are very resourceful, brave, physically strong, particularly Kate Ericson. Here they are completely the opposite, hysterical, weak, & seemingly brainless in general. Neither would have lasted 5 min in the novel. For some reason Lady Clare is now the French Sister of Arnaut & doesn't speak English, & in the final minutes has to be saved from hanging in the castle, despite never going there in the novel. In fact all the characters seem to think if they jump around panicking something well happen.Obviously all the English are rotten creeps who butcher the local population, burn down Castlegard (which never happens) and are the villains whilst the noble French are the heroes. The novel correctly shows them all to be extremely violent & not to be trusted. For some reason Lord Oliver is actually a lot nicer in the film than the novel.ITC is in reality a multi billion organisation with state of the art equipment, though in the film it looks like the cast have walked into a budget laboratory, where mad scientists rule. Doringer, who is a not very nice sociopath, is here more of a misguided guy scared of his own shadow.I could go on, but one word of warning, if you are going to see the film make sure you haven't read the novel first as you will be sorely disappointed. Hopefully, one day they might make a decent series out of this, as it has loads of potential, but please have a different cast, as this lot are shocking. Michael Sheen excepted.",Timeline

90,FranktheRabbit,This film is history...,4,20 December 2003,"Timeline (2003/Richard Donner) ** out of ****Michael Crichton has written some of the most entertaining novels of the late 20th Century. ""Timeline"", one of his more recent novels, has just been adapted onto the big screen by the man that brought you Lethal Weapon.I saw the movie with my parents, and both of them read the book. After the movie, we went to dinner and discussed it, and they informed me how poorly adapted the film was from the book. Judging by the comparisons that they made from the book to the movie, I think it is safe to say that the film was poorly adapted into a Hollywood popcorn flick.The story is about archeologists in France who go back in time to rescue one of their own, who is in great danger. So they travel back to 1357 France to search for the father of one of the archeologist (Paul Walker in a horrible performance as usual). There are two good things about this movie: The Final Battle sequence; and Gerald Butler. Butler plays one of the archeologists who is very fascinated with the new environment that he studied about in his own time. He is easily the most likable character of the bunch. The final battle sequence was very good and entertaining (unlike the rest of the film).The main thing that ruined the film for me was Paul Walker. In my opinion, he is the worst actor in Hollywood today, and the script didn't help. Though there is some hope...the film is suspenseful in some parts and at one point even has a conscious and some honesty. For instance: After one of the archeologist kills a soldier, instead of acting natural, they are perplexed, and actually sit down and think about what they have just done. So, there is something going for it.In the end, it all comes down to this: ""Timeline"" is just a book adapted onto the screen as Hollywood garbage. But there are some good qualities. -30-",Timeline

If you haven't read the book (which I have and you should) it is all the more horrible. At least if you've read it, you can conceive the brilliance BEHIND the terrible (there is no other word) story.I don't know if it was Billy O'Connolly just deciding to go back a few centuries ""just to see"" if he could survive the great war by himself (which he can't). Or if it was that Kate girl screaming ""yahoo!"" when they found the end of the tunnel. Or if it was Chris calling out to Marek ""come on, we're going home!"" and Marek holding a beautiful girl in his (admittedly fabulous) arms replying ""I AM HOME ... tell the others I said goodbye"" This was a painful, painful movie.It had several moments when it could've been a real movie. When Marek kills someone (in defense) he looks genuinely and suitably anguished. But then the moment passes and he (tally ho!) decides to jeopardize everything and run around after Lady Claire, wreaking havoc on history.And the people ARE beautiful. Paul Walker and Gerard Butler are possibly the two most beautiful men in the world. They were EXACTLY the Chris and the Marek of the book. Even David (who, for some reason, is ""Josh"" in the movie) was fine.I understand that they were pushed for time (joke) in cutting the book down but maybe less time could've been spent drinking beer and flirting on the dig and more time could've been given to the magnificent journey in 1357.Did you know that there is a fantastic scene where Kate finds the mythical deranged knight in a ruined chapel and he drags her to a block to cut off her head??? More of that and less of the headless-chicken action.More of Marek without a shirt on ...",Timeline
93,Bob A-2,Predictable time-travel plot; cheapness is in lack of imagination,4,27 August 2005,"Suckered myself into watching Michael Crichton's Timeline, based on author's reputation. Name of producer Donner should have been clue as to film's actual cheapness, but low-budget sci-fi can be okay, like Tycus (a sort of When Worlds Collide remake) or Asimov's Nightfall (apparently inspired by HG Wells' story Kingdom of the Blind). Timeline turns out to be formula retelling of Final Countdown, with now-predictable ""surprise"" ending, except here time travelers have gone back to medieval battle instead of Pearl Harbor. Some identifiable Crichton touches, but already handled in other stories.When I identify the film as ""cheap"" I must amend that the visual effects of battle scenes, electronic zapping and medieval fortresses (we'll assume computer-generated) are quite plausible. The prosaic photography and the aforementioned lack of creativity in the story line are more what I mean.No-name cast (all very good actors) tells us that cost was cut in that area, but this type of venture is exactly the type of place where new hopefuls can earn their veteran credentials without being too embarrassed by a shameful past.

94,experten,Big time adventure,9,24 July 2004,"1. Paul Walker does not ruin the movie. Btw., it is rare that an actor alone ruins a movie, the director and the story are usually more important.(True are that some actors can make a movie a lot better. Paul Walker may not be one of them.) 2. The acting is good. Director Donner knows what he is doing.3. Those reviewers on this site complaining about plot holes, stating that the movie makes no sense have no good examples of this.4. Those reviewers are always complaining about time travel movies because time travel in itself makes no sense, it is almost as hard to understand as eternity or trying to imagine the end of the universe.5. It is an action movie based on time travel. If you do not like action movies and/or can not accept time travel because it is illogical you will not like the movie. 6. However, if you like action, Timeline has a lot of good action, impressing battle scenes, good enough acting, fantastic music, no boring parts, lots of suspense and an unusually interesting storyline.7. DeNiro, Pacino or other big names are not in the movie, but if that makes you think that a movie can not be good or the acting has to be bad, then do not watch the movie.8. It is an American mainstream movie. This means that Crichtons scientific explanations are not present in the movie. I have read the book and found the theories about light beams interesting, but I can understand that it would be too hard to follow for a lot of people and it would also ruin the movies high tempo. However, the lack of explanations does not make the movie illogical it only means that everything is not explained.9. It is entertainment, not a science documentary that a lot of the reviewers seems to think, complaining about why an actor who is not a Scotsman is acting that he is (it is his job), why people can understand each other and those standard language faultfinders arguments. Would you clever faultfinders prefer a movie where everyone spoke medieval French or English that you could not understand? Of course you would have preferred that, also without subtitles because in real life there are no subtitles when people speak.

It is almost like experiencing two very different stories with a similar foundation. Having read so many negative comments on the film, I expected to hate it but actually enjoyed it. The enjoyment, however, came because I had the background knowledge of the book and all of the missing pieces. I suppose that the book could only have been portrayed in a 6 hour mini-series if justice were to be done and I anticipated some streamlining. But they left out too much of the good stuff. Timeline is an entertaining and informative novel but the film focused on the action/entertainment and let Michael Crichton's research fall by the wayside. Perhaps the producers feared it would be too erudite for the common movie fan unless they thinned it down to the marketable nitty-gritty. In the book, Claire was a very complex and unpredictable woman. In the film, the script made her one-dimensional. Missing, too, were the challenges of language which could have added so much to the film. And I really missed Chris and Marek in the jousting tournament. I could go on but the bottom line is that had the film worked in another 30 minutes of material instead of focusing on the action it might have been an excellent work.

This action/adventure movie is mildly entertaining, eventhough it deals with the notion of time travel which has always been an interesting subject for cinema.A powerful technological corporation creates a machine that can transport physical objects through space from one location to another. Problem is that it doesn't work correctly. They discover that instead of transporting things through space, it's sending it through time. When a Scottish archaeologist (Billy Connolly) is sent back in time to 14th century France, he leaves messages of help for his students in the present to find. So the students and his son (Paul Walker) travel to the Middle Ages to locate him and bring him home. Two major obstacles stand in their way. The archaeologist is captured by the British and the transportation device is blown to pieces, due to a grenade sent forward through time, by accident.The beginning grabs you almost immediately. A man appears out of thin air, dressed in rags, and collapses on a deserted road where a passer-by (played by Donner regular Steve Kahan) picks him up. During the opening, intercut with the aforementioned scenes on the road, there are beautifully lit shots in a forrest of the same man being chased by a knight on horseback. As the movie progresses you begin to analyze that beginning, realizeing that it doesn't make much sense. Nor does the moviemakers bother to explain the occurance when a character brings it up. Why the man appeared on the road, and not in the transportation machine, is never adequately addressed?Michael Crichton has successfully made a name for himself in the realm of science fiction. His Jurassic Park novels were adapted for the screen during the 1990s to blockbuster success, thanks in large part to it's director Steven Spielberg. Crichton has been associated with such winners as ""Westworld"", ""Coma"" and Robert Wise's ""The Andromeda Strain"", whether it's in the capacity of director/screenwriter or based on his source material. There has also been disappointments. ""Congo"" and Barry Levinson's ""Sphere"" failed to attract audiences. This movie comfortably fits inbetween the hits and the misses.What stands out about this movie is that Donner has cast actors rather than stars. Walker is probably the most well known of the cast due to his starring roles in The Fast And The Furious movies. David Thewlis and Frances O'Connor have received critical acclaim on previous films. The other cast includes Connolly, Matt Craven and Anna Friel. To some, the real star is Crichton and his novel. The old adage is that the story is the star, the one thing that truely matters. Without a great script, the talent won't be interested.Problem is, that the story isn't partically that good. While it has an interesting idea, the screenwriters don't explore all the possibilities that the notion of time travel possesses. For an action/adventure, the midsection is slow. Both of the love stories woven into the narrative are so unbelievable that it grinds the movie down to a halt. Only two things could've saved this movie. If a big name star headlined this tale then their appeal would've blinded audiences to the problems in the writing. And why Crichton wasn't hired to adapt his own novel is a mystery?Suspension of disbelief plays an important part in the majority of movie genres. Science fiction, fantasy, action, comedy. Any type of movie that doesn't necessitate realism falls into this category. But Yank Walker as the son of Scot Connolly, that's truely unbelieveable. I haven't seen a more ludicrous choice of casting since Dustin Hoffman played the son of Sean Connery in Sidney Lumet's ""Family Business"".On the plus side, you're never too sure which characters are going to live or die by the conclusion. With some movies, you know instinctively which person's going to be dispensed with. It's like watching the original series of ""Star Trek"". The crew beams down to an unexplored planet and there's always an extra that beams down with them, someone you've never seen before. Their costume is different, they never speak and in numerous cases they don't even have a name. (The comedy spoof ""Galaxy Quest"" reinforces this theory.) With this movie, it comes as a surprise when certain players are killed off.Movies that deal with the notion of time travel have always held the public's interest no matter how sophisticated or Z grade the production is. Majority of the intellectual time travel films bring something new to the table. But ""Timeline"" plays it safe, useing pre-existing theories and conventional ideas.The standout is the climatic medieval battle scenes. Donner is well versed in the action department due to his work on the Lethal Weapon series. These scenes, filmed at night, are exciting, breathtaking and well executed. It's a shame that the rest of the movie isn't as good.It's ironic in post Gulf War II that the villains of the piece are the British and the heroes are the French. I'm sure that this aspect of the movie will make it unpopular in certain world markets. Yet another movie that'll suffer due to being released at the wrong time.Overall, ""Timeline"" takes itself way too seriously. What's needed is a self depreciateing sense of humour, characters making fun of the situations that they're in. No one ever questions whether time travel is possible and they take to it as if it's like riding a bike or some other mundane activity. Since the early movies of Terry Gilliam, every movie set in the middle ages seems too hygienic as if all their costumes have just come back from the cleaners. Filth and squalor seems more appropriate. This is an OK movie, best suited for video though the battle scenes will lose its impact on the small screen.",Timeline

I loved this movie and found an actor in the title role I had never heard of before, Gerard Butler. He is so handsome and so charming. The movie was great, a new spin on going back in time, cast was varied and good story line. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. For a fantastical movie it was well done, and colorful, good battle scenes. I did not read the book, so I cannot compare it to it. I know Hollywood always changes everything. All I know is I loved the movie, and it is worth your while to see it. I have watched it over and over again, just cannot get enough of Gerard Butler!!",Timeline
115,StevePaget,"Terrible, predictable, ham-fisted time-travel movie.",2,21 July 2004,"(Spoiler Warning. Some of the events in the movie, such as they are, will be revealed.)Now here's a movie with serious problems. It is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, which is sometimes a good omen (Jurassic Park, Coma, Westworld) and sometimes not (Sphere, uh... Timeline). I do have the book, but I have not got around to reading it yet. After seeing this I may never get around to it.There are two type of time-travel movies. Movies which feature time travel, and movies which are ABOUT time travel. This is a movie about time-travel and little more. The story is very, very simple: A group of archaeologists are working on the remains of a French village, which was the site of a great battle between the French and the British in the 1300s. Suddenly they discover some artifacts in a sealed chamber which seemed to belong to the leader of their dig crew, who has recently gone away from the site on business. How did the items get there? And why did he leave a note in ink which carbon-dates to 600 years ago? Fairly obviously, the crew members all go off in search of their friend and discover he has travelled back in time to the date of the battle. They follow and get embroiled in the cut-and-thrust of medieval war. Etc etc etc. It's not exactly gripping, and if it wasn't for the time-travel element I doubt anyone would be sold on the idea of watching a French/English siege movie.So this film depends for its life on the fact that people find time-travel intriguing. That's not a problem in itself (as Back To The Future is wholly about the mysteries and problems caused by dickering about in the time stream) but it has to be done well. This is not done well.The problem with movies like this is that they have to create a premise that explains why travelling back in time is possible. But it can't be too easy, otherwise where's the drama? In order to inject tension, there have to be reasons why the travellers cannot just come back at will. Back To The Future was excellent. The car ran on nuclear fuel. None of that in 1955. Brilliant.Here, they spend so much time propping up the shaky premise that the story was forgotten. It's just not a very interesting plot. They can go back in time, but to get back they need these little medallion things. And those run out after 6 hours. Oh, and they have to be standing in the open with no obstructions for 40 feet all around (so no pressing the little button in a building, or near trees. Or.. well anywhere really except for one spot in all of France, it seems). Oh, and they can't come back yet anyway, because someone has blown up the machine with a grenade. So they'll have to wait until the VERY LAST MINUTE of their 6 hours before it's fixed.This plot is being held together with sticky tape, for crying out loud.It is also very predictable. Early on in the movie a woman discovers a beautiful wall mosaic which has been smashed. ""Who would do a thing like that?"" she asks. ""YOU WILL!"" screams the entire audience. Not content with that, they do it again later. ""I wonder whose tomb this is? It's a knight with an ear missing"". ""IT'S YOURS!!!"", we all shout. For the rest of the movie we're all willing him to get his bloody ear cut off so we can get it over with. Time-travel movies often employ this sort of ""set it up/pay it off"" method of storytelling. But this is ham-fisted and obvious in a way that BTTF never was.The acting isn't terrible. Billy Connolly does his best as the old archaeologist guy, and the other leads are pretty and harmless. I do wonder why they cast Anna Friel as the French Lady Claire. She wouldn't be my first choice. Her accent is terrible, but luckily she limits herself to sub-GCSE French speaking (""Allez! Vite!"") and conveniently her character is fluent in English too.The movie ends, the princess (sorry, Lady) is saved and the evil corporation who invented the time machine is presumably finished. And so am I.I'm just wondering. The novel of Jurassic Park was considerably different from the film. I wonder if Timeline might be redeemed in print? I might have to give it a go.",Timeline

Although the science behind how they got there didn't make much sense, the movie was good. I didn't quite understand how the artifacts they found in the future had to stay how they were in the past, I guess showing how destiny is pre-written? The battlegrounds and the sets themselves weren't as great or cinematic as Game of Thrones or The Borgias, and these are TV shows.

It should have been a great adventure but instead it comes off as a kiddie movie with gore and violence. A major problem were the characters themselves: most of the main characters were annoying and irritating and definitely charisma-less. In particular, one of the lead female characters (Kate the archeology student) comes off as such a strident and shrill pain-in-the-butt that I had high hopes of her meeting an early demise. If I had been there and it was up to me, instead of catching her, I would have given her a little shove off that thatched roof - ooops! Another annoying character, who seemed essential to the group, was surprisingly disposed of early on and all I can say is, ""Merci beaucoup!"" As for the other problems with plot holes, etc., such as that the English and French that was spoken at the time would probably not have been intelligible to a modern speaker of those languages...well, so what?

(But then, if you were going into a Michael Crichton scifi-book-to-film translation expecting accuracy to the book, you obviously never saw ""The Lost World"", which in terms of book-to-film accuracy makes this look like ""The Lord of the Rings"" by comparison. In fact, given how the Jurassic Park series fared, I was pleasantly surprised that material from the early chapters (before we meet our main characters) was even included at all.) Taken for what it is - a popcorn film - it's a pretty good one.

Some of the actors (the dad and love interest of Walker especially) turn in laughable performances, the plot is very thin, and the science of it is not very well explained or sound.First they say, you need clear space to use the teleport thingy, than a guy teleports in the middle of the woods surrounded by trees. Than the whole beginning with the guy, who appears in the desert...How can he appear in the desert if all the teleport thingy does is gets you back to the machine in the present?

It works OK as a sequence of events although you get the feeling that it's all too rushed. There are a lot of characters and none of them are well developed. They've made the mistake of trying to include everyone from the novel rather than focusing on one or two. However, the real problem with this movie was the script.

However, i still rented out this movie, thinking that being based on a Michael Crichton novel, it cannot be that bad. But here is one movie that deserves its awful reputation. Is it the horrible horrible acting? Is it the historical inaccuracies? Is it the gaping holes in the very predictable plot? Well yes. Pretty much. All of these reasons make Timeline an often hilarious yet ultimately dreadful viewing experience.The plot centres around the transportation of an archaeology professor (Billy Connelly) back to 1357, during the middle of the England/France 100yr war. It is down to his team of younger excavators and his unenthusiastic son, Chris (Paul Walker) to go back and bring him home.Frances o connor, as the Professor's assistant Kate, in particular stands out for one of the most hammy and immature female portrayals i have ever seen. You want to try and blame it on the script but even that cannot be excused for her over-dramatic and pi55 poor performance that makes Paul Walker appear to be Oscar worthy, which of course he isn't. I would suggest that if Walker does want to be taken seriously as an actor, which he has stated more than once in many interviews, he would be best to choose his films a lot more carefully. Here, he does not prove that he can handle leading a film. In fact, he himself seems embarrassed, pulling all kinds of faces as he hides behind the other characters in the shadows.Anna Friel is yet another woefully miscast actress, who takes the role of French Lady Claire. Now, maybe it is because i grew up watching her as lipstick lesbian Beth Jordache in Liverpool soap Brookside, but as a french graduate, i certainly am able to say that her accent is pitiful and incredibly stereotypical. Maybe, to make it easier for her to grasp, they only give her a few basic lines in French such as ""allez, Allez"" and then suddenly her knowledge of the English language suddenly improves tenfold and her accent comes and goes in spasms. Why oh why can the producers not hire authentically French actors. Most of them speak better English than the Brits do French. Added to this the complexities in the development of the British and French language and we have many horrible historical inaccuracies. They simply did not speak the same language that is spoken today.I am not even goosing to mention Billy Connelly's humiliating role as an incompetent and dawdling professor that surely ranks as his personal career low.

If you haven't read the novel you can enjoy it as a nice and decent action movie set in the Middle Ages. But if you've read it, well, you'll find some important changes and cuts.The first thing I noticed once the film was finished is that Marek's character isn't well defined, since he decides to stay in the past, but the script doesn't tell us that he has a great passion for this historic period. So a person who hasn't read the book can't understand his choice; you can say that he's in love with Lady Claire, but it's a poor motivation.Then, there are some sequences which aren't in the film: the mill and the tournament scenes are totally cut off from the screenplay.Another basic question is the way the characters keep in touch with radio transceivers. It's important because through this narrative means, in the novel, the characters find out that there is another person from the present day.Lesser important things: the existence of characters created by the film's writers who isn't in the novel (like the French guy who is sent with our heroes to help them with the language, even though in the novel there is a character who knows Occitan) or some changes in certain characters (e.g. Kramer is a woman in the book).Even Doninger's end is slightly different: in the film he's killed by a knight, while in the novel he is sent in 1348, during the Black Death.",Timeline

I don't how I would have understood any of what was going on if I hadn't read the book or been familiar with science fiction.Main problems:Clunky exposition. I can understand that they had to simplify it it because the book spent a lot of pages on it. The funny thing is despite dumbing it down they still left in jargon terms that were never explained. From this I assume they were expecting Sci-fi junkies (like me) as an audience - in which case I don't understand why they would essentially take out all the sci-fi and make it into an action film!Left out any quantum physics explanation or explanation of the many worlds theory. Perhaps understandable, however I felt Crichton came up with a novel approach to time travel and that would of set it apart from other time travel movies. In this movie it is merely plot device.They removed essentially all the best scenes in the book. They removed a lot of the humour too. - Poorly edited - No dramatic tension. You pretty much never fear for the safety of the characters. Linked with the last point: you don't feel enough of bond to any of the characters to care what happens to them in the rare cases they DO look like they in danger. They were obviously very focused on making the movie fast paced. It was that, but if they just spent a little bit of time on character development the action might have been actually been interesting. Forced romance with absolutely zero chemistry or tension. There was romance in the book but it was handled completely differently. Crichton even did a better job even though romance isn't exactly one of his strong suits. Not enough character background to understand the character's motivations. People randomly miraculously learning to speak English.It doesn't explain why ITC is funding a group archaeologists.",Timeline
139,tbirdman-1,Not a bad movie though it could have been much better,6,4 March 2006,I have not read the novel by Michael Crichton though I watched this movie on cable TV expecting a lot and in the end I came away quite disappointed. I never saw it in theaters and now I'm very glad that I did not waste my money! The story started out promising and throughout the film much about the time travel part and how the professor went back in time was left unexplained. On top of all that I found that the casting of Paul Walker was fine. Though there was not much development to his character and ditto for the rest of the main characters as well. Frances O'Connor played her role well though overall this movie could have been done better. Paul Walker is overall a strong and likable actor who can carry any movie on his own. How did he manage to get cast in Deep Blue!? Most likely to appeal to the young female movie goers. Just as Jessica Alba was cast for her sex appeal to male movie goers. Though sadly Paul Walker passed away late last year and his fans are still mourning his untimely death.,Timeline

Nothing special is there to be said about directing or visual effects either.This is probably one good film to make your kid a trifle interested in archaeology, but hardly more.Summary: Best captured en passant",Timeline

I wonder what kind of stuff they're teaching in the schools now, because you used to have to know two to four Romance languages just to get in grad school, let alone do any postdoctoral work. But it's France, so, O.K. ""Timeline"" gives a historical basis for disagreement in Franco-American relations by sending an American back in time to cause the problems. These unbiased and logical minds spend less than ten minutes between discovering the time machine and getting into it. Only one of them doesn't go, I guess he's the ""control"". The compelling argument the cruel ""suit"" uses to get them to go is their comparative superiority to navigate the time due to their knowledge. A dark secret lurks.But their vanity shields them from questioning what went wrong. The beginning scenes in the Dark Ages are horrible. Someone saved a few cents on the special effects budget, it's just a bunch of theatrics then a cut to the river they supposedly appeared in. Then they walk through a forest that looks suspiciously like the Hollywood Hills. The ""manor"" they've been studying looks like a paper maché shack thrown up on hockey sticks.None of these modern day scientists know Karate or Tae-Bo, have any money/valuables or relations back then, but show up in a group anonymously in the Dark Ages and expect to go about their business unnoticed. Because they've studied the Dark Ages and people did that all the time. None of them can defend themselves worth a damn. Nobody brings a Red Cross pocketknife. They shift from egging each other on like rednecks on ""The Family Feud"" to panicked hysteria and physical attacks regardless of nearby threats. In one scene the professor's son leaps at their guide, although the English soldiers searching for them are directly less than fifty feet away. The script gets so bad though you can't blame them for forgetting. When the group yammer at the corporate Satan for sending the Professor back to the dangerous Dark Ages, a few lines later one of them demands to know why two marines are coming along.The marines don't do too well, they get offed seconds into the trip. Obviously Dark Ages behavior wasn't in his Seals Training module. One of them scurries like a churl wide-eyed before oncoming horses and gawps at his pursuer until he bites it. The other takes a few arrows before ripping the stop off a grenade. Evidently he could pocket a grenade but an arrow-proof vest wasn't a good idea. Transiting through the portal (all done with smoke and mirrors, check) the entire lab is exploded. The CEO is shocked, shocked, that even while he'll evade every law and invent new ones to avoid, his time travellers have tried some portable life insurance. What the evil greedy czar of business doesn't tell them is that the DNA reconstruction process has a few bugs in it Supposedly several of our crew should be giants, much larger than the average men of that era, but even the ""warriors"" look like some guys plucked off the lot coffeehouse. Lord Oliver's lady isn't even accorded one shot, just shuffled aside off screen. The Manor parlor looks darker than a stable. The point of view is hard to follow, it strays from broadly scenic to capture the vast panoramato broadly scenic to capture the vast two-shot and the actors leaving frame awkwardly. Ah, the accents. Marton Csokas (XXX, The Fellowship of the Rings) is half Czech, half Australian, and does a two-faced combo English drawl/American whine. Gerard Butler, (Reign of Fire/Phantom of the Opera) who I thought was Irish, pretends to be Scottish. Anna Friel, an English actress, plays a Frenchwoman. How she understands Butler I have no idea. Frances O'Connor, the wonder of ""Mansfield Park"", plays a shallow and not-too-bright archaeologist who is ""obsessed"" with her work. Connolly's Irish accent is never explained. David Thewlis, (English) plays the corrupt American twerp. Lord Oliver, the English chief pillager, sounds authentically English by way of the Tottenham Court Road. The French Lord, Arnault, is played by legitimately French(and half Irish) Lambert Wilson, (the Matrix III, Sahara) who outclasses them allYou may remember him from some Calvin Klein ads he did whispering about ""Obsession"". You'll know the better actors in this movie by the amount of hoods, helmeting, and hair they have dragged across their face. You can't blame them for hiding..This movie seemed to be a first class assembly and it was as if the main actor, possibly Sean Connery or Harrison Ford, had dropped out from playing the Professor, Lord Oliver, or the CEO, and they made the movie anyway. Certainly the script couldn't have been an incentive. Michael Crichton must have bawled all night after seeing this. I read the book and it's as if they warped parts of it on an acid trip and other parts at 16 rpm. What other reason can there be? What, Michael Caine got choosy suddenly after 40 years? You know you're in trouble when an actioner with this much talent comes out and the over-the-line name in the trailer is.Paul Walker. That's right, white-bread, empty-eyed, one dimensional Paul Walker. He dresses Mervyn's. He looks 12. You usually tune into a movie like ""Timeline"" to see the villain get his comeuppance.

But it's actually quite a gentle film, okay for kids and sensitive people. This film is an enjoyable watch for people who are willing to just sit back and relax. Movies are entertainment, not a PhD's thesis. A word about the old English speech: In the few films where a lot of the old style speech has been used, people complained by the thousand because they had such difficulty understanding it. In the 13 hundreds if they were to do a play where they spoke in 21 century style, they would get the same complaints.Gerard Butler who stood out in the roll of Merick, is an actor with a great screen presence who looks and acts remarkably different in each film he is in.

This is one of the many examples of ""Holly Weird"" butchery when it comes to ""book to movie"" translations and interpretations. After reading Jurassic Park and then seeing the movie, I realized that you could tear the book in half and you'd have the movie script.Hollywood is running out of ideas and is desperate to keep the audiences' attention by convoluted original story plots into explosions, meaningless dialogue and unnecessary nudity unto the screen.For those who are intellectually challenged this movie will appeal, however; for those who want a lot more I recommend reading the book.

145,wbg02,"at best fair, mostly mediocre",6,6 May 2006,"I thought the book was mediocre to fair and after having just seen the movie, that is how I rate the film as well. First of all, the English and French languages in the fourteenth century would be unintelligible to most modern speakers. To have all the characters be able to communicate with the people from the past, rather than just the couple of experts in the ancient form of the languages as in the book, is a glaring mistake caused by lazy film-making. Secondly, the film, apparently to justify the heroes aiding the French, have the English as all bad and the French as the ""good guys"". The book more realistically portrays both sides as being led by ruthless men. On the plus side for the film, director Richard Donner, an old pro, was able to present a visually captivating final siege of a castle. The movie also rightly focuses on the character Marek portrayed by Gerard Butler who gives by far the best performance in the movie. Timeline avoids the temptation of making the film all about the character of its only known ""star"", Paul Walker.The movie's basic flaw is also the fundamental problem of the book. It is essentially just one chase scene after another. Of course the same could be said of Chricton's Jurassic Park; however, being chased by dinosaurs on an island is more thrilling than being chased by Englishman through innumerable castle hallways. More seriously, the sense of wonder presumably an archaeological team would have if it would suddenly plop into medieval Europe is mostly absent. Since the premise is so weak, the book only briefly and the movie hardly at all allows the characters to explore the 1300's before they are running around again. To sum up, the movie is competently done. This is not a case of a movie destroying a great book. It is just a film that couldn't rise above its weak foundation.",Timeline

I was just disappointed that they left out the whole tournament, and the character of the black knight, but I guess De Kere was enough.  Have a piqued your interest?  Good, then go and read the book.There were just 2 problems I had with the movie: The first and foremost would have to be the casting of Paul Walker.  Who in the hell decided to have his talent less ass as the lead role?  Everybody else acted circles around him, and it really showed.  The second was really a minor thing and shouldn't base your decision to watch it.  It's just that La Roque and Castlegaurd looked 600 years old when they went back, and if it's 1357, those castles should look new.But as I said before, the movie stayed true to the book pretty well, and except for the cut out scenes, different explanations and changing around of characters, it was good.  I mean you should expect that from a movie adaptation.  However if you do want a little tidbit of changed info from the book, the character of François never went back to 1357.  If fact he didn't even know about it.  François was the French Prime Minister that kept good relations between Doniger and France.  Oh and Chris was never Johnston's son.

It was fairly realistic for Hollywood; everyone spoke modern English and French, wore spotlessly clean clothing and apparently visited a dentist frequently, but there was no magic or obvious historical errors. Weapons tended to be fatal but deaths were very clean. (I guess it's an improvement over the movies where limbs get hacked off and blood everywhere and the victims keep on moving.)(Some light spoilers follow) It didn't do much for me. There was too much Hollywoodism; a huge plot point was blatantly foreshadowed at the start of the movie, and the only question was who. They did the standard ""take too many characters into a dangerous situation, and kill a few to show this is a dangerous situation, but the rest are now Characters and are only to be killed Dramatically."" The characters are all archeologists who were exploring the ruins of the time they are sent back to; but they frequently don't use common sense and the information they are should have to figure out what's going to happen. Once or twice they get in what are effectively prisons with the door left open, because apparently people from the Middle Ages are too stupid to see the obvious way out. Lastly, I'm getting tired of Michael Crichton's evil inventor business men who cuts corners and ignore safety, the same one that's shown up in several other movies. He's just not a believable character, especially not here. The ending was cliché, to top it off.But, if you can get beyond the plot, it's not a bad movie. The actors are decent and cute enough, it's a beautiful countryside with a nice reconstruction of what was apparently a fairly accurate France of the time (I'm sure a historian could pick nits, but I couldn't.) It has some nice battle scenes; nothing as good as Braveheart, but that's a high standard.

Technical difficulties, and the unfortunate time travel to arrive on one of the most gruesome battles in Medieval France results in a battle for their lives as the danger rises with every hour. No doubt, a lot of poetic license has taken place in the History department. I actually found this movie quite funny, I laughed quite loud at the blatantly obvious change in history. I guess this could have been excused if it was more of a quality production, however I didn't find the special effects anything special at all. Paul Walker, Francis O'Conner and Gerard Butler are all good actors. If hte acting was poor the film would be so much worse. Good thing money was spent right in some areas. The script made me want to scream in anger. If the English are following you and trying to kill you as you wade down a stream with a military leaders sister in a small barrel next to you, and you could very well be slaughtered at any moment, you don't try and pick up a chick! Enough with this, lets make out with people whenever we want regardless of the total not romantic situation we are in! Maybe I'm just jealous because it was Gerard Butler.mmm I wouldn't see it again.",Timeline
167,Fulcrum,Timeline To Mediocrity,6,25 November 2003,"I did not have high expectations going into this movie but still came out unfulfilled... and it wasn't because I didn't get enough popcorn.  Richard Donner is obviously in his element when directing action sequences.  The attack by the French on the hilltop castle was thrilling and visually stunning.  There were also a few fun 'jump outa your seat' moments.  Good cinematography, quality costumes coupled with beautiful scenery shots were certainly pleasing to the eye.  But without a strong lead actor and the writing to accompany him/her, this movie just didn't have what it takes to entertain fully.  Paul Walker just can't shake that surfer dude persona from ""The Fast and Furious""... unless he masterfully succeeded portraying the awkward California son?  Naw, it was just bad acting or poor casting.  I just couldn't warm up to his character.  Combine that with a rushed plot and untapped actor talents (Anna Friel) and you have a movie that just doesn't fully entertain.  Perhaps someone who read the book would feel more informed but I came out with too many unanswered questions and a feeling of apathy.",Timeline

This movie also isn't as much an adrenaline rush as, say, a horror flick or The Expendables.This being said, just because it's not like the book does not mean that it is bad. And just because it doesn't have AA12's and heavy machine gun fire doesn't mean that it's boring. This movie does have a lot of adventure- from sword fights, to castle sieges, to fleeing from angry knights. It has an interesting storyline. The actors (including Gerard Butler and Anna Friel) are great and the props and costumes are superb.In short, this movie is made for an audience that appreciates a good blend of action and storyline.

171,crossing_lethe,Meh - mild spoilers ahead,4,7 August 2005,"As much as I would like to love this movie, it's just not going to happen. The script is nothing special - in fact, it's just plain bad in many places. One of the most notable instances is Claire only communicating in French with Marek and the other time travelers at first despite being completely fluent in English. Another is the ITC's determination to kill off one of their men they left behind instead of going to get him. Why do they want him dead? Nobody will ever know - Unless it's in the book, that is.The actor's performances are enough to make or break a movie, regardless of the quality of the script. It is especially important for the main characters to shine - see Gina McKee's tanking of ""The Forsyte Saga"" or Johnny Depp's rescue of ""Pirates of the Caribbean:CotBP."" The former's bland portrayal makes the storyline of her central character seem implausible while the latter's energetic portrayal is credited with saving the pirate movie genre.For the most part, the character portrayals here are uninspired at best. At worst, they're the reason why God invented Razzies. Paul Walker's career is living proof as to how far good looks can get you. His wooden acting is more than any suspension of disbelief can overcome. One wonders if there's a deal out there that Paul has to do so many mediocre B-list action/horror flicks before he gets to become a real boy. The usually fine Billy Connelly and Frances O'Connor do nothing to rise above the script. Ethan Embry isn't all that bad, except for being woefully miscast. Anna Friel is just plain lucky that I have a bad ear for accents and can't tell if one is really badly imitated. Most of the other actors - like David Thewlis and Marton Csokas - sleep through their roles. While watching this film, it seems like the majority of the actors saw it as simply a paycheck and didn't bother to try.The only good performances - recognized by the fact that they make certain parts of the movie watchable and, dare I say, even enjoyable - are by Gerard Butler and Michael Sheen. Both of them seem oddly animated in a cast of cardboard cut-outs to the point that they seem out of place. Having the larger role of the two, it's mostly Mr. Butler who carries the film. By and large, the movie isn't too bad as long as you don't try to think about it. Ignore the plot holes and the bad acting and it isn't so bad.

The wrong things were cut, important issues not explained, story bits changed for the worse.....I guess you have to blame the screenwriter and director. The characters were not developed enough... You didn't care enough because they were cardboard cutouts. Paul Walkers acting made me think of old Disney Movies from the 70s. Frances O'conner was better, but still not believable(I like her voice). The others were better yet, but it still was a sterile, empty world and never drew me in.....They didn't even seen to spend much money on the sets. 14th century village that were clean????

However, I have to ask- did the other reviewers even READ the book?? Lets be honest people- it's almost impossible to make a movie that follows the book exactly, word for word. It would be a 12 hour film! In my opinion, and this is stated from someone who has read the book numerous times, the movie Timeline does a good job picking up the highlights of the book, keeping as close to possible to the original story. Some of the mumbo-jumbo technical stuff is glossed over in the film, and I praise the screenwriters for that, as adding it would have made a confusing, boring mess to the movie. One of the greatest parts about Hollywood is the use of creative license. Yes, the film uses this during spots, but NOT enough to detract from the book plot. Yes,the acting is definitely not the greatest (with maybe the exception of Matt Craven), but again, NOT enough to detract from the book plot. This film takes what the readers loved about the book and changes very little. I could easily correlate the two. And I challenge the negative reviewers to find me a movie that doesn't change some parts of the book it is based upon. If you like the book, give the movie a chance.",Timeline

I don't even really like time travel movies, and I still liked it. Partly because they don't really change anything, what they've done what already meant to happen if you know what I mean.

(Sigh.) What a steaming pile of nothing in particular.Thankfully I haven't read the book, so at least I was spared the full horror of this tiresome made-for-TV style widescreen time waster. What I got from it was just boredom, a mild sense of betrayal (made easier to bear by low expectations), irritation at the careless plot holes and appallingly uninterested acting, and a growing hatred for the characters that had me rooting for . . . well, no one.An exception to the otherwise universal pointlessness was Gerard Butler as Marek. He really stood out. In fact his brief verbal description of the siege of Castlegard early on was probably, in terms of action, the most exciting moment of the film. He almost made it seem as if something interesting might happen later.But Anna Friel did have a cute smile, no doubt about it, and the wayward comings and goings of her medieval Frenchness were a highlight. The maniacal rugby playing English leader, Lord Whatever, was all right in small doses. The colours were nice enough, and the river was a believable river. Also the catapults were good.The rest was dreadful, but not in a great way. David Thewlis, for example, seemed to be played by a stand-in, not that anyone else was fully present (again, except for Butler, perhaps he didn't get the memo). And between them Billy Connolly (stumble, whimper, whine), Paul Walker (""Be careful!"") and Frances O'Connor (who am I in this scene?), along with whoever cobbled together and okayed the script, created the most lacklustre and unlikeable bunch of bewildered heroes I think I've ever seen outside of satire. But, and this must be stressed, they were not funny.The villains were equally pathetic. The plot absurd. Events ""back in the present"" did not add drama to the medieval storyline, but just sort of interrupted it like commercial breaks.

179,fondablaster,Source material and a supporting cast offer little help to cinematic failure,2,16 February 2005,"""Timeline"" is arguably the best novel Michael Crichton has written to date. It transcends genre with a brilliant blend of Science Fiction, fantasy and historical accuracy. At its core is an intense drama built around honor and valor; around romantic tension and fruition; and around the ideology that the protection of friends and family is worthy of any sacrifice. Crichton's descriptive prose is eloquent and his dialog is at once vivid and realistic, voiced by characters that the reader may either love or hate but never feel indifference towards. The characters demand the respect of the reader's convictions because the novel is so well-written. This reader found it simply unputdownable. Conversely, and unfortunately, the movie adaptation is nearly unwatchable. Director Richard Donnor (Assassins) does what he can with a pathetic attempt of a screenplay translation tag-teamed by part-time writer Jeff Maguire (In the Line of Fire) and newcomer George Nolfi (Oceans 12). It is not a total disaster. Some of the acting is above par, but only from the supporting cast; most notably the minor characters played by Billy Connolly, Ethan Embry and Rossif Sutherland. The leads, portrayed by Paul Walker (2 Fast 2 Furious) and Frances O'Connor (Windtalkers), were appalling awful, accentuated by the absence of any of the chemistry that made their literary doppelgangers so appealing. On the upside, the costumes were wonderful and filled with detail. However, it is unfortunate that such apparent hard work was wasted on this dreck. And, as is typical with a big-budget Hollywood production, the special effects are decent. But the real trick pulled off here is how the filmmakers were able to butcher a stylish and effective 460+ paged novel and, with less than two hours of screen time, turn it into a generic, pointless action flick. This is the worst Crichton adaptation since ""Congo"" and the worst Richard Donnor movie since his last one. Let's hope this is his last one.",Timeline

Just watch it and enjoy it for what it is! I'm glad I saw this in 2003 before reading the review sites like now that give it a low review. I would have missed it having judged it being rated under 6 stars.It's one of those gems of a good movie that got a very false and fallacious review mostly by book fans upset not falling the book to detail.

181,analyst12,Honest-to-God-truth about the film,8,26 May 2006,"A lot of comments revolve around loving the book and hating the way the movie changed main plot points and characters.That's bullcrap and if you're thinking about watching the film, just ignore it.I didn't read the book, so obviously I'm not talking about the accuracy of the statements about character switching. I'm sure that all of the factually accurate comments that talk (in excruciating detail) about the character depth, plot points, etc. etc., from the book are completely in order. My problem is that most of these commenters forgot to watch the movie.Here's the honest-to-God-truth about the film: It's a great sci-fi/action film. Donner is a terrific director and knows when (and how) to make the cuts. I've read TONS of Chrichton novels and seen the movie adaptations and few directors know how to deal with the technical side of things like Donner does.Keep this in mind when you watch: the film is about being a part of a highly dangerous rescue mission - NOT TIME TRAVEL. Time travel (in the film) is just the vehicle for an emotional experience, namely being really, really, really out-of-place.For example, I didn't know that Donner's team invented the character of Francois, but he was a *great* addition to the plot. Though he dies, it's not in vain *emotionally* because it demonstrates how out-of-place this handful of academics really are. It also shows the danger inherent to virtually every aspect of the mission. It's possible to do everything right and still die in this unforgiving environment.Similarly, Marek's brief history lesson about the history of Lady Claire thoroughly upstages the main rescue plot in a highly welcome way. For his subplot, he's really on the money with the line, ""we make our own history,"" and ""it's not about rocks and rubble, it's about people; what's their story? That's what intrigues us."" The emotional core of this part of the film is strangely compelling - especially when we find out how ""wrong"" the initial history lesson is; as the characters are in the past, they are literally making history as they go.Most viewers who come into the film expecting to see a transcript of the book and viewers expecting to see a movie about time travel will be severely disappointed. But, if you're looking for a movie that uses time travel as the vehicle for a really big adventure, you're in for a real treat. Timeline is about making history and being an active participant doing so. It's really a fun, thoughtful, and feel-good film on the whole.

I was impressed when every other scene was not a paradox, which is the trap so many of these types of films fall in to. Most of the action felt well placed, and not just thrown in for the sake of action, but there was a few things that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor in my opinion.What really hurt this movie was the performances. It was actually a bit puzzling, because some of the roles were really played out well by talented actors, but other parts were so pitiful it was embarrassing. For instance, Lady Claire and Merek were really well done, but Frances O'Connor's, ""Kate"" was gut wrenchingly bad.Unless you read the book, and really liked the story, I cannot recommend this film.

I found this movie entertaining enough to sit through rather than to get up and leave.  I found the ""time travel"" aspect innovative and intriguing! *spoiler* like a precursor to ""Beam me up Scottie""! Thumbs up for their time machine theory.  I was amused by the plot simply because it was so totally unbelievable that you just had to accept it - even though I can not in any way imagine that given the chain of events that occur that this crew of Archaeologists would CHOOSE to go ""back"" such as they do - especially all the ""leaders"" abandoning their project.  But OK, I went along for the ride after paying my matinee price.  If you can get past the implausibility, the movie is entertaining enough.  Lots of sword stabbing and medieval combat techniques. Albeit most scenes left me wondering WHY they would react as they did without trying to really ""fit in"" and be unnoticed.  The ending was OK although pretty predictable given the little info you get prior to their ""transport"" back.    *spoilers* - oh but poor Francios - couldn't they have just left him out - he really serves no purpose - I'm presuming he was a bigger character in the book and his 'I am a spy' thing was in the book but since I haven't read it - who knows - I certainly didn't see the need for him.  And same goes for the ""physicist"" who stays behind.  Maybe the book had a use for him, but in the movie...LAME. I thought the ""markers"" were unnecessary too since there was no reasonable explanation of why ""humans"" needed them, why the dead guy on the highway ended up there, and why the ""professor's"" seem to not be affected by a TIMELINE like the others that went back.  Again I'm guessing they stretched a good book thing that just wasn't necessary in the movie or was poorly portrayed in the film. I enjoyed André's 'It's Me' realization even if it was predictable - very amusing and portrayed in character well.I give a 5/10 for amusing me on the implausibilities enough to stick it out to the end of the movie AND because they film makers did do an excellent job of portraying the ""Archaeologists"" - even if very abbreviated.

The characters are portrayed as real people put in an unrealistic situation: while Steven Kramer is explaining the invention of the 3-D fax that opened up a wormhole, you can hear chatter in the background between confused characters. The way the characters talk to one another is the same way you would talk to a friend... or an enemy; no hammed-up drama, they simply incorporated reality into the acting and writing of this feature.Also, in most action movies, killing someone is a fairly simple task. If the hero has to shoot a bad guy, he/she does so, and doesn't think about it again. Here, when the archaeologists that go back in time are forced to kill as their last option (never arbitrarily), you see their reactions: the reactions of normal people who have just taken another person's life.So I would ask all that are weary of seeing this movie: set your inhibitions and prejudices aside, and you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon, just as I did on that summer day last year.",Timeline
194,etsoi,Big difference in thrill and suspense than the original novel,5,30 May 2007,"1. The first disappointment of the movie is too brief to cover the whole story within 116 minutes. It may take two or three chapters, or even an mini-series to cover the cream of the story, like the scientific theory of Quantum roaming, the thrill and suspense. 2. The second disappointment is the lousiness of the scene setting, especially the castles. The castle is just like a big house, too small to be a castle standing for battle. 3. The third disappointment is the love and romance element too shallow. Unfortunately, it is same as the original novel by Michael Crichton. 4. The last disappointment is the characters. The Professor is not portrayed as a wise and calm as the one in the novel. The effect is bad, because the whole team is all the same panicking, without someone wise and calm. The Professor in the original novel is like Gandalf in The Lord of the Ring.",Timeline
195,cosyCloud,Is this supposed to be like the book?,3,16 April 2004,"TimeLine the book is probably one of my most favourite books. I have read it countless times and have enjoyed it every single time. So I was very happy when I saw a preview a long while back that there was going to be a movie about the book.I wish that when people decided to make a movie out of a book they would make the movie just like the book. Don't change the plot, don't change the characters or their relationships, just leave it intact. They never do. I have been disappointed every time a book that I enjoy has been brought to the screen. I really don't know why I keep getting excited.Ok, I understand somewhat that you can't re-create everything from a book. It just wouldn't be feasible. But they changed entire genders of people, removed some more interesting moments, changed character relationships slightly, and totally bombed at all the stuff dealing with the ITC, time travel and the vileness of both bad guys.If you have read the book and seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. Some of the more exciting parts of the book were just not in the movie, like the struggle between the crazed man at the chapel, the fight at the mill and the entire tournament. I mean I was confused with the whole thing. One of Donnigers right hand men is supposed to be a woman, Chris is NOT the professors son (in the book he is father figure), the French guy that gets killed in the movie does not exist in the book, Marek is supposed to be fluent in all aspects of time period including the languages. I could go on about all the differences between the book and the movie, but there is no point. I would have to use up an entire screen just to point them out. It was a interesting movie if you had NOT read the book. However, if you have read the book and enjoyed it, a lot of great stuff was left out or warped into something different. I would say that the movie is very loosely based on the book, VERY loosely.Overall I say I was disappointed. I did enjoy Gerard Butler as Marek, Ethan Embry as David Stern and Paul Walker as Chris. The females leads (Frances O'Connor as Kate and Anna Friel as Lady Claire) could have been better.

You had almost no background on ANY of the characters, nothing to build on; ideas were gutted from the book and slopped onto the screen in a brisk, here-ya-go! cafeteria style manner.All I can say is, I'm astounded there are actually people who are gung-ho for this movie, as I feel bitter that I was excited for months waiting to see this movie and all I got was a sore mouth from constantly gritting my teeth in frustration.

This is not like someone from Shakespeare's time understanding modern English, 14th century French and modern french barely resemble each other.To make matters worse (concerning point two above), at one point the French Lady Claire is talking to the Scottish archaeologist who says ""are you seeing anyone at the moment"" and she says confusedly, ""Of course - I am seeing you!"" - the Scott says ""We are speaking the same language but we don't understand each other"".

201,margaras,Run away! Run away!,1,30 May 2004,"""Timeline"" is allegedly based on a novel by Michael Crichton. Allegedly, because although it shares the original's storyline of modern archaeologists being dropped into 14th century France, it does away with a lot of the original - changes characters around, makes several female characters male, and removes the plot hole of the original whereby it was supposed to be a parallel world rather than time travel, but that can't work because if the marooned-in-the-past Professor leaves a note for his students in the present day then it has to be time travel. In the film it's time travel and like it.I can't remember anyone who was in it except Billy Connolly, and I suspect that was because Sean Connery and Robbie Coltrane both turned it down with a look of disgust.The film is also pretty much one long fight, without any of the nuances of the 14th century world that Crichton put into his book - and doesn't make sense time and again. One of the two remaining female characters, supposedly a woman with a love of that period of history, says that being alive in that time would be as bad as being killed in it. The English soldiers are able to speak to the American and Scottish timetravellers in perfect modern English, never mind that 14th century English was a very different animal and many of the English officers and nobility would have spoken Norman French. The French very often reveal themselves able to speak English - unlikely, see previous point for reason. One French character has to have English interpreted for him and then becomes able to speak English. Funny, I didn't see him put a fish in his ear.One scene I was looking forward to was the Green Knight (? not sure of the name), who is straight out of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"": ""None shall pass!"" Was he in it? Was he heck.The English are depicted as more or less the Nazis, the basis being presumably, ""The German army was in France in 1940, so another foreign army in France must have been exactly the same"", thereby ignoring the whole historical background: the English rulers at this point were actually the descendants of the Norman French who'd conquered England 380 years earlier. All the English characters are bad and all the French, good. One timetraveller kills an English soldier and says what? ""That's for my friends you killed!""? No, he says, ""For France!"". Why?Most appropriate line in my opinion goes to the English general who says during a particularly inept French raid, ""I'm getting tired of this."" I can imagine an entire cinema audience replying, ""So are we.""",Timeline

The plot wasn't really followed through in many points, and there were a few really glaringly off moments. But it was fun. And that's what it was meant to be, fun.

This one is the exception. It has been noted elsewhere that the battle scenes are pretty good, and I agree, but for the most part, the movie and the book are only tentatively related.It is hard to know even where to begin, there is so much to criticize, but let's have a go at a few things. One might ask why two female characters in the book suddenly became men in the movie when their femaleness is necessary to the plot, and there is no discernible reason for the change. The acting, to be charitable, is very uneven, and the script is hardly a work of art--nor even particularly workmanlike. And the movie could not have been shot on film, because the lighting and daylight images have all the charm of stark and harshly lit soap operas, especially closeups.If you are attending the Daughters of the Serbian Revolution convention, and they are selling this DVD for 50 cents in their bargain bin, buy it if you want to favor someone you don't like with a gift.

It's not as though they can't act and Richard Donner has directed some classics, so what the hell went wrong? I still haven't entirely figured it out but I'm fairly sure that the screenplay / adaptation is to blame; the characters had no depth and important aspects of the storyline were either omitted entirely or rewritten to try and make them more audience-friendly. How disappointing it was to see Crichton's fantastic theories belittled to ""we accidentally discovered a wormhole"". Maybe the cast could have developed their characters a bit more but they would have had an uphill struggle from the outset.If you aren't intimidated by a book, then for God's sake read that version first before judging Crichton's part in this fiasco.

The plot is brilliant, and if Michael Crichton had written this purely as a screenplay, I am sure it would have been much better received. Unfortunately, there is an excellent book of the same title authored by Michael Crichton, which spoils the movie experience for many people. Science fiction is an extremely difficult genre to master, particularly when the science of the science fiction is set in the current age.

But when I saw the movie, I found out that this isn't Walker's movie. I don't know why he's even billed an action star when he didn't take part in any risky tasks (maybe it's because he drove a car so fast in his previous movie that he got the title action star) and the rest of the cast, esp. Frances O'Connor, are flimsy and ineffective. In contrast, the fun in the movie rested mostly on Gerard Butler's character Andre Marek. I saw Gerard in the Cradle of Life (sequel of Lara Croft, Tomb Raider) and 300 and I was awed by his intensity of bringing out his character to flesh. Acting must be inherent in him as he was able to deliver his part very well. I give this movie 6 over 10 all because of Gerard Butler. Good work, man! Cheers!

I remember Ebert saying that Rambo 3 was a ten, when Siskel questioned him he said that for the movie it was, it was a 10.Enough said! If you like fun movies, watch it.",Timeline
225,peter-w,I liked it,8,11 February 2006,"It's hard to make a movie like this, and after watching the special features, my respect for the cast and crew is high. I was expecting a sweetened Hollywood time travel movie, but was heartened to see that a real attempt was made to convey the nasty brutal and short life that folk endured in those days. I was reminded of ""The Abyss"" by the marines with the untrustworthy leader getting his come-uppance. I think the time travel wink out scenes worked well, but I did not think that the reconstruction of the mechanism after the explosion worked. The destruction was too great, the equipment to complicated to be able to reconstruct it so quickly. Better to have gone to the other unit they briefly mention having created in Europe.The film did not address the results of the deaths of people back then who might otherwise have bred and left descendants, the old grandfather paradox. I would have had all memory of Francois removed from the modern people, because Kate had killed his ancestor, or something like that.I say well done to all involved.",Timeline

This movie focuses on how a team of young archaeologists having to go back to the 14th century and to find a lost professor and to bring him back.  I like how the main characters only have a certain amount of time to travel back and forth through time, it builds up the excitement.  I like how the use of time-travel is different than what we've seen in other movies with the same subject.  But this is a movie that is more than just time-travel, it is a movie that includes war.  The war between the English and the French made the movie more interesting, and more suspenseful as to if the students can retrieve the professor and to make it back alive.  Michael Crichton delivers another smart thriller as he did with ""Jurassic Park.""  If you want another movie to enjoy and to remain on the edge of your seat while watching it, go see ""Timeline.""  It's worth it.",Timeline

228,rebelliousrose,I've rarely seen worse.,1,8 March 2004,"Timeline isn't the WORST movie I've seen this year. But only because it was a year that had House of the Dead in it. Actually, upon thinking about it, I liked House of the Dead better than Timeline. At least the combat scenes in House were realistic.Timeline is a movie in desperate search for a plot, and a point. One of the film's major problems is that Donner never quite focuses on what he's doing. There's a lot of ""hey, Mom, check out this special effect!"" but the movie never decides if it wants to be action, adventure, a period piece, a romance, or a man vs society conflict.Part of what's dragging it down isn't the acting, nor the actors, but the godawful cheesy dialogue and poor plotting. For a fairly talented bunch, there are very few moments where any of them can find any connection to their characters and do more than mouth lines. One of the best moments, acting-wise, in the film is when Gerard Butler, as the professor Andre Marek, is kneeling over the body of a man he's just murdered in cold blood- and the actor's face shows every awful moment of what he's just done. With NO lines to mess up the moment. Unfortunately every time Donner gets the chance, he goes for babble over substance.Ethan Embry is surprisingly good, managing to throw one of the movie's best hissy fits while maintaining what credibility left him by someone's decision to give him Robin Hood's beard. Watch out; when his character gets upset, his voice goes into the ultrasonic ranges, and suddenly his relationship to Tony Randall really shows.Paul Walker isn't bad. He also isn't good, but neither is the movie. He's been lambasted pretty heavily by critics, but since the first thing I saw him in, Varsity Blues, was a nuanced, measured performance, I know he's got it in there somewhere. Walker suffers from what I call ""Reeves Disease"" where no one bothers to make him act, since the pretty face is all they've hired.Frances O'Connor is the token female, in a movie with only one other female character. Every other female featured in the book's narrative has either been removed or changed to a man. Hello, Hollywood? Women can be Marines, and corporate attorneys? O'Connor does her best with a script that requires her to cling to Paul Walker at any moment that she might show some real acting, or her character any sign of being a strong female. Donner doesn't like women much, does he?The production values are impeccable, and my favorite cut in the movie was a long pan of a medaeval wagon train; Donner does the long pan, and apparently couldn't cut out the close shot of a draft horse lifting it's tail- which was unintentionally hilarious for me. Costumes are excellent and well researched, and all the villains are appropriately grimy, with greasy hair and bad teeth. I do think it was amusing that Timeline was obviously filmed before ""Freedom Fries"", since the French are the heroes.The love stories are clunky, and weigh down the action, once again upholding the Hollywood idea that you can fall in love with someone you've seen for a sum total of 47 minutes in your life, throwing your whole existence away to be with that person.I was sorry it wasn't a better movie, or even still, a worse one. Unfortunately, it wasn't even bad enough to register as a camp classic.However, Gerry Butler spends a good three minutes without his shirt, and that was a good three minutes as far I was concerned. As a sidebar, that man can RIDE; he must have learned from Attila, but he rides like he was born in the saddle. Look for when he tries to drown his horse.Another favorite moment is after listening to everyone including the French speak perfect, idiomatic modern English, one of the extras gamely tries for a bit of linguistic reality- ""Milord! Trebuchet!"" and everyone onscreen stops for a minute to stare like ""who is this twit?""It FELT like the ""six hours"" tagline.",Timeline

The main character that falls in love with Kate was the only actor who made me cringe. I was impressed with how the French was accurate and how much was spoken. The fact that the English sounded pretty much like other modern British accents is excusable because it's just an action film, and who knows what the language really sounded like then. I'd rather it tell a story than be pretentious like The Passion which pretended to know how aramaic sounded, but didn't even get the accuracy of the well-known crucifiction spike through the wrist instead of hand.

We get to see medieval times and get to think to ourselves ""What would I do if I could go back through time and live history?"".

The DVD also has sections on the making of the movie, which are inspiring if you are a film buff. The excellent cast worked well together and the production company went all the way to research and produce a film about a specific historical period.

Only reason to watch it is if you're totally bored and there are no other choices (including reading the novel), and so throwing away the time is the only available option! In that situation, you get what you deserve, a pure time killer with no redeeming attributes :(! (Alternatively, get hold of the Michael Crichton novel, it's excellent, an absolute page turner!)The story setup is completely missing and so even though the main body contains some excitement (with marginal relationship to the Michael Crichton novel), the viewer is completely on the losing end of the stick. The characterization could be worse for a couple of the characters, but by and large, the original characterization (refer to the novel) is discarded. The largest miss being the film-manufactured ""male love interest"", Chris. The movie tries to create him as something special, but he actually isn't (read the excellent Michael Crichton novel)!This movie is pure film-flam and deserves the virtually universal poor ratings it gets.

The twists are predictable, but I feel they just leave bigger plot holes.The acting is under-par, except Butler is good though, and his side of the performance is solid. Frances O'Connor - I half-expected a better performance, and for Paul Walker - he really isn't a great actor - he just has the looks. Anna Friel - not convincing at all. Neal McDonough - good enough to be a selfish dude. David Thewlis - I say stick with something like...Harry Potter. This movie didn't let him show off his acting range I think.

It's just another action movie with many open questions and without dedication.As long as the characters are still in the present, it's mostly boring and long-winded, since nothing is really happening, except some dialogs to prepare you a little bit for the rest of the plot. In the past most of the story is based on running away from some middle age guys, hunting some middle age guys, rescue some middle age guys, escape from some middle age guys, and this repeatedly several times. It is not relevant at all for the dramaturgy in the middle age part that it happens to some time travelers. If it would have been a pure middle age movie it would be still as boring as it is, maybe you wouldn't be bothered with questions coming to your mind why the whole plot makes no sense, what was there first, the story or the filmed material.

The movie is good because it takes the overused idea of time travel and gives it a twist of history. I knew from the moment that I saw it thought that something was wrong with it. After finding the screenplay and watching the movie in subtitles I don't know how many times I realized that the dialogue that Paul Walker uses is horrible. It was like watching 2 Fast, 2 Furious set in 1357 France. I think that the dialogue was poorly written and that they could have done so much better but with what they did the movie is great for it's genre.

She's running around this entire movie sporting a god-awful 80s girl-mullet and he's too permed,tan and gay-looking to be interested in someone like her, romantically. Ugh, then when they go back in time, and the ""bad guy"" asks Russif Sutherland to translate something to the other ""bad English guys"" sealing Russif Sutherland's doom... I just slapped myself in the forehead. Totally retarded. I also hated the parts where the Americans who travel back in time, earnestly try to explain to the French that they aren't English, in order to save themselves from being killed. Duh. Today, as an American, I go to England NOW, and it's very obvious, I'm not bloody English. Now insert a gap of several hundred years, it's also going to be obvious, I'm not bloody English. Now BOTH the French and the English would probably think these Americans came from somewhere surrounding the British Isle, because they are speaking a version of English, but come on... They might be mistaken for Irish before anyone would accuse the Americans of being English. Also, I think I've seen better sets at the Rennisance Festival in Annapolis. Every time an actor throws a sword I expect to see tourists cheering in the background wearing shorts and Shakespeare feathers, holding a turkey leg in one hand and over-priced beer in the other.

242,zonistonate,One Performance worth seeing.,6,12 February 2006,"I caught this on cable TV as the starting credits were displayed. What caught my attention was Gerard Butler's name. Having recently seen the film version of The Phantom of the Opera, I decided to stay tuned to watch his performance. Phantom was the first thing I had seen him in, and I really enjoyed his portrayal (yes even after watching Crawford twice in the stage version), so was interested to see if he was any good in anything else. As the movie started talking about the archaeological dig, my interest perked up.I'm not sorry I decided to watch it, as I am a history buff and have always enjoyed reading about European history. The lead acting in the movie left a lot to be desired, with the exception of Butler's performance as Andre Marek. Some of the peripheral character actors were good, as were some of the battle scenes, but Mr.Butler's portrayal of Marek saved the movie, as far as I am concerned. After going back and seeing several of his other offerings, I have decided the man has an enormous amount of talent(some yet untapped) and each movie role has seen him improve upon his last performance. He was excellent in The Jury and I also loved Dear Frankie. A chameleon, he gets under the character's skin. The camera loves him and the directors recognize that fact.I predict big things for this young talent, and I hope that his choice of materials allows him the latitude to show the public what he can do. For his portrayal alone and the charisma which he imbues in the character he plays, it is worth watching.",Timeline

Butler is a standout. As is the brief turn by Sheen. Unfortunately, Walker, who grew to be a very serviceable actor, can show a bit in over his head. O'Connor can deliver key lines with as needed dramatic American flair (better than Thewlis). There is a point after one of their escapes where they're all in a circle panicking and McDonough is really losing it. The ensuing necessary developments and twists progress the plot well. Action sequences are top notch. A little more here, a little less there...could have easily been a much more engaging motion picture.",Timeline
245,ghostreveries,Decent...some terrible acting,5,25 July 2006,"In order to enjoy this movie, do not read the book...EVER because the script is at times irrational and cheesy with cringing dialogue. However, ""Timeline"", directed by Richard Donner, can be fun and entertaining on a rainy day filled with sufficient action sequences and tension, notably with the impressive final battlefield sequence. Costumes and sets are well-researched, music accompaniment is thoughtful and appropriate with a medieval and contemporary flare. The pace of the film is fast enough to evoke suspense but not at a dizzying tempo.I'm very critical of the acting aspect of a film for I believe it could break or make a film, and in the case of ""Timeline"", I believe it hindered the film for the acting was very frustrating and embarrassing to watch. Who, in their right mind, would ever cast Paul Walker as lead male?! His performance as Chris Johnston was laughable, unprofessional, and he just seemed like he had no clue throughout the film. This guy makes Keanu Reeves look Oscar-worthy, thus such a talentless dud should not be employed in the movie industry. Frances O'Connor as Kate was, if even possible, worse than Walker. I found her too annoying, whiny, and not genuine enough. As an immediate contrast to the pathetic and disappointing performances from the two leads who had zero chemistry, Gerard Butler as Andre Marek and Anna Friel as Lady Claire were surprisingly convincing as a couple. Out of the whole cast, only Butler provided a rounded, three dimensional character in which the audience could hold sympathy to for his involvement with this film, which was a complete waste of his acting talents. It was Butler's performance that provided the only credibility to the film and saving it from a dismal rating of 0/10, so kudos to Butler who did as much as he could with such a poor, restraining script.If you're looking for a fun film, then ""Timeline"" is for you, though it won't make much of an impression.

246,GuasdualitoMan,A mediocre execution of a good idea,5,14 May 2006,"Simply put, the only thing that saves this movie from being a total flop is Michael Crichton's original story. This movie is clearly geared to a very young (early teens?) audience, which is more interested in medieval battle sequences than in why those battles are taking place or whether they are historically accurate.Movies that explore time travel have an excellent opportunity to create tension by playing with time-related paradoxes, something this movie does so clumsily that it actually interferes with the suspension of disbelief.Additionally, characters are paper thin. Things happen simply because someone wrote them into a script, but there is no logical threading of events, and no time is used to explore why characters act the way they do. Saturday morning cartoon villains have clearer motivation than this movie's bad guys, or good guys for that matter.The plot is no help - the movie spends so much time in gratuitous slaughter that important events - such as when key characters make decisions that place them in circumstances central to the story - are missed completely.As a consolation, the action sequences in the last 20 minutes or so are visually appealing, which makes the movie's end look good by comparison to the rest.If you are a fanatical Michael Crichton fan or if you are into movies with lots of medieval sword fighting action, this flick is worth watching; otherwise you will do better spending your time elsewhere.",Timeline

From the background extras it would appear that everyone had a good time which unfortunately despite what Frances O'Connor said ... did not show in the final edit. This was not the actors fault. No come on be fair ... you have to start with a good script, then develop the characters and have them interact with more depth than this speeding train wreck of a film allowed them to. What the blue blazes was everybody running around for rushing from one disastrous/near death experience to another. Never heard of lying low, blending in, sounding out the situation THEN making a plan of action. Having said that I have to admit I bought the DVD just because Gerard Butler was in it - someone give that man a good script for heavens sake.

However, the movie throws out all the details that made the novel enjoyable and opts for pure action.  What is left is another cliched sci-fi/action movie.

Although I really liked this movie, I wished they had  parts like the Jousting part. If you have read the book you would know what I'm talking about. The game was still good w/o the jousting but I would have liked to have seen it. The last battle was very cool and if you haven't read the book some of the twists would be surprising.

Naming a movie after a boring and tedious school project is not getting off to a good start. The previews came next, and those, too were horrible. Intertwining blue electricity, people in office attire, and medival castle scenes really didn't do much for me. This movie was a train wreck waiting to happen.So when I was sitting in a nearly empty theater opening night (an explanation would be appropriate here for my presence at opening night: basically my ""friends"" said we were going to see Bad Santa but then changed the plans on me, and it was off to Timeline), all of my expectations were fulfilled.People were laughing at parts that were meant to be serious, simply because the acting was so bad and the story made no sense. At every point in the movie, there seems to be another meaningless plot twist. It was so profound when that guy hitting on the medival girl said ""we speak the same language, but we don't understand each other."" Please!The special effects were horrible. The time machine looked plastic and flimsy. This should have been a made-for-tv movie, and instead they let this travesty into the theaters.Do not waste your money or your time on Timeline.

256,Cynder3680,"Butchered the book, SPOILERS INCLUDED",7,14 April 2004,"I had two major problems with this film:1) Paul Walker has got to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He sounds like the Mad TV impression of Keanu Reaves.  I expected him to say ""dude....Kate totally broke my heart....that's bogus"" somewhere in the beginning.  Sorry, that's as funny as they come at 3AM.  Anyway, he got easier to bare as the movie went on, but he definately reminded me of Keanu in is lowest form.2) Why change things from the book?  I can understand some parts you have to make the movie fit under 2 hours, so you cut things out, or shorten things and give them the same results.  But why the hell is Chris the professor's son? Why does he hate archeology when in the book he's one of the archeologists?  Why is Kramer suddenly a man, what women hating person changed that?  Not to mention in the book Kramer was also a lawyer, not a scientist.  Also, Gordon did not go back with them, did not die, and the whole character of Kramer did everything Gordon did in the book. And who the hell is Francois? Also, they screwed up the whole Chris/Kate romance thing...the book was better and not rushed (which made it seem unrealistic in the movie). If anyone was wondering, in the book Chris didn't like Kate till later, same with Kate, but nearer to the end. Lastly, I thought they could have kept in the whole part about the professor being captured cause he knew where the path was, and the whole idea that the castle started at the Green Chapel (the battle with the green knight would have been nice). The Lord Oliver character was all wrong too.Anyway, now that I'm done ranting, the movie on whole got more entertaining as it went.  The first 30 mins or so was unbearable. Other than Paul Walker, the rest of the acting was fine. Still not sure why anyone would cast someone that bad in the main role. I gave it a 6 out of 10.  Generous 7 for entertainment value, I think if you are not interested in reading the book, or can't read, the movie might be a little more enjoyable.",Timeline

However, the film still retains a good quality and the story is good, even if it doesn't follow the text and several details are removed.The only real pitfall of Timeline is the casting of Paul Walker.  Walker not only brings his ""Dude, Where's My Car?""-esque acting skills to the screen, but actually single-handedly ruins most of the dialogue of the movie. Well, only the parts that he's in.  Unfortunately, this Hollywood flop was cast into a supporting-lead role and is seen in a large portion of the film.The Bottom Line:  Whoever cast Paul Walker should be tied, beaten, and dragged behind the back of a truck.",Timeline

The movie does not capture all of the intricacies of the novel, but it stands on its own two feet as an enjoyable escape. No doubt it does not engender the ruminations on lost time that you will find in, say, the writings of Marcel Proust, but that's just fine. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be transferred to the middle ages, enjoy the experience vicariously through this movie. If you've never had those fantasies, even the cinematic adaptation of Proust's collected works won't help you.

Bad idea.The writing is bad, some of the actors do not fit their roles well, and the editing is awful (granted it must be hard to edit a movie that jumps back andforth from the past to present).I really wish that they had not invented a character (Francois) or sent Gordon back. That really didn't make sense. Also, Decker was introduced far too early. I understand that they couldn't possibly do a complete adaptation without a long movie, but this is a joke. No movie would be better than this one. The least they could have done was not drastically change the plot and lengthen the movie by another 20-30 minutes.

The conundrum of changing the future by visiting the past, but who can say who did what first? The book goes into much more detail naturally that a movie only has time to gloss over. The drama of finding things to be different than originally believe via their studious efforts. The reason why diametrically to only that time was curious as well.

You make things that sound plausible in the book, but would seem odd when seen, more visual and cinematic, more visceral and immediate. Historically, you change languages, customs, levels of hygiene, etc, so the audience isn't alienated.And you end up with a family-friendly time-travel adventure romp with a gutsy heroine and clever plot-twists that's fun and isn't too cerebral.

It has a plot which immediately sucks you in... and keeps you in. Each scenes leaves you tense with anticipation, wondering what is going to happen next... YOu almost feel like one of the characters! My favorite part about it was definitely the music, it kept you interested, sitting on the edge of your seat. It truly has an awesome score, and I recommend the soundtrack!We also enjoyed it because there is little cussing, which is hard to find nowadays. If you want a great action packed film to sit down and watch with your kids, this is the movie to see! This movie has several themes which are awesome to discuss as a family. We also all felt ourselves longing to read our history books again... and we began to study the middle ages as a family.The movie's characters are somewhat similar to Lord of the Rings, they are peaceful people thrown into turmoil, and history rests in their hands.

There are several corny and laughable parts in this movie, but the foreshadowing is great. The sets and scenery were usually excellent, with attention to detail being generally good. The costumes were pretty much time-period accurate, with nothing out of the ordinary.

It would be acceptable if the techniques used in the book would be taken seriously! I mean, replacing the whole quantum physics idea with a simple ""wormhole that can only be found by accident""? Oh please! In the book they tested everything for a dozen times and they had like 3 versions of the machine! There even was a backup plan!

Everyone in the movie is capable of speaking both English and french... except the main characters! Somehow they only understand English. Even the ""pure french people"" seem to be able to understand English :p Why didn't they do some research (why research, it's all in the book) on the languages?

Paul Walker, though very good-looking, should have gone into modeling or some other career that doesn't require him to speak. I found Francis O'Connor's character a little irritating, although I'm not sure why -- maybe just because she was romantically tied to Paul Walker's character. The film did not do justice to the Andre Marek character, played by Gerard Butler. Butler was the best thing about this movie, but his role was seriously underwritten and he didn't have much to work with, which was a shame since the book did such a wonderful job with this character.

The epic battle scene is an exciting (although predictable) climax, and the special effects and art direction are impressive, though, and probably save the rest of the movie from being a total turkey. The writing, however, could use the most work. None of the characters are fleshed out and the dialogue, disguised by thick (and mostly inauthentic) accents is quite boring.

I am often disappointed by movie adaptations of novels that I have enjoyed, so I wasn't expecting to love this movie -- but still I was looking forward to seeing the director's version of the story. Unfortunately, this movie has very little to do with Crichton's novel, was the most disapointing adaptation I have ever seen.I was unable to recognize a single scene from the movie that was true to the book.  It is easier to say what is the same in the movie's story than to being enumerating the differences.  Sometimes, the story in a movie needs to be changed to fit the medium -- but in this case the novel was already in a very cinematic format, one of the reasons I was looking forward to seeing it on film.  There was no reason to completely abandon the story, but that is exactly what they did.  The only part of the story that is the same is in the one paragraph plot summary above.The settings were all changed for what appeared to me to be budgetary reasons, although I was amazed to see that they apparently wasted $80M on it -- I have no idea what they spent it on, and I'm sorry to have helped them get $10 of it back, it was a complete and total waste.   I was expecting to see at least one of the very well described cinematic landscapes described in the book, but the filmmakers chose instead to film completely on location -- and at locations that had very little to do with anything described in the book.The characters lost all depth and complexity they could have had and were instead reduced to stereotypical roles.  Interestingly, all the strong female characters were either changed to men or, if they were allowed to stay in the movie, reduced to simple plot devices -- there only as damsels-in-distress for the male characters to save.  The male characters might as well have been football players, yanked off the gridiron and handed swords and mates.I can see how I could perhaps forgive the complete departure from the novel (although to reduce confusion perhaps it shouldn't have been called Timeline) if the movie somehow came together into something worth seeing in its own right, but in this case it was nothing more than a clichéd medieval castle siege movie, very weakly set inside a time-travel scenario.  I give it no more than one star -- there was a nice scene with Trebuchets, but that's about it.I highly recommend not wasting any money to see this movie.

290,clairobscur,A bland action flick with a time-travel pretext,3,12 September 2005,"I didn't read the book, but no comparison is needed to notice it's a poor movie.First if you expect some interesting sci-fi story about time travel, don't bother. It's just an action flick. Actually, if you like action flicks, don't bother, either.Nothing is credible in the movie. The characters (a group of archaeologists) are rushed back in time to rescue their boss, who, for some unknown reason, has himself been sent back to the middle-ages and is missing. Five minutes after they hear for the first time about the time machine, they're all standing in it, making ludicrous facial expressions. From then on they run here and there, dispatch a number of soldiers and knights and get killed when they aren't nice-looking enough. These amidst burning houses, crowds of peasants being herded here and there and besieged castles.I know you're supposed to suspend belief when watching a movie about time-travel, but here, you just can't. The behavior of the characters isn't credible. The quick techno-babble about time-travel isn't credible(and anyway contradictory). The depiction of the medieval period isn't credible. The action parts aren't credible The romances aren't credible. The battle scene isn't credible.Anyway, you've understood the plot even before they travel in time. Yes, the grave they excavate will turn out to be exactly what you expect it to be.You couldn't care less about the characters. Anyway they don't care about each other, either. Two of the main ones are a father and a son, and when one gets (apparently) killed, the other vaguely protest but otherwise doesn't bat an eye. There are romances, but you wouldn't know it if they weren't kissing each other from time to time. There's *zero* characterization. They are cardboard characters. I couldn't tell for sure that they are poor actors, because the script is really awful, so I doubt anybody could have done any good acting with it. What I can tell is that they didn't put much effort in it. They probably understood it would be a waste of their time, as it was of mine.It's not he most awful movie I ever saw, but it's just completely bland and uninteresting. Every element of the plot is rushed so that you don't have to wait before the next ""I barely escaped the knight's sword"" or ""look at the flaming arrows"" scenes. Anything that could appear to be interesting is quickly mentioned then completely forgotten. And there are a number of elements that *could* have been interesting.

It has some nice battles, lots of fire, speed, colors, and something that looks like a plot and might make sense to you ... if you have read the book.But there are some points that are really, really bad and make ""Timeline"" less than an average popcorn flick.First of all, the acting is bad, the worst performance being the one of Frances O'Connor. It's unbelievable, it's overacting, it's a lack of characterization. It's hard to believe that this actress has been cast for six other movies after failing so miserably in this one.Second, although there are some good lines of dialog (especially in the first 30 minutes or so), the script just doesn't work. Everything in the film seems to be in a rush - no time for explanation or characterization. The story has lots of leading characters, but nearly all of the 116 minutes are spent on action scenes ... many of them pointless and unoriginal. You have no reason to care about these characters, because they are totally flat and uninteresting. Maybe this is why the tension stays on quite a low level.Third, the scenery. These shots are so obviously indoor that the final fight reminds me more of a stage play than a movie. There isn't even a background in many scenes. I mean, it's night, so everything outside the castle is pitch black ... or that's what the designers obviously thought. Actually, nothing about the midage scenery looks real.

There are enough extraneous bits to the story to allow it to be pared down to a good 2-hr movie without damaging the basic story or premise.The movie plays like a high school theatresports troupe ad-libbing their way through Hamlet having read the play once.

No. The basics are there and that should be enough.What I especially like, though, is how Gerard Butler's character stays back with his newfound love. And when Kate's character actually bashes in that beautiful work of art, which she earlier says about it ""what SOB would ruin such beauty"" (I forget the exact quote)... then she realizes that it was her that did that! And when you look at the scene where she bashes it in vs the first time we see the damage, the patterns of breakage are different.

302,eincrouknight,A Good Adaptation,6,25 August 2021,"I don't think I've ever posted a review to IMDb, but a number of reviews making bad points inspired me to chime in.After rereading Timeline about two decades after I read it as a kid, I watched this film for the first time ever and decided that it is a good adaptation. It made me very happy in some areas where the screenwriters made changes I think were improvements.For example, in the the novel the team enters the Dordogne region in 1357 and starts remarking upon how clean the air is and how there are no sounds of vehicles or machines. This was a ridiculous reaction for the characters to have, unless they had literally never left the city in their lives. They could have had the experience of a beautiful, untouched forest in 1999 without utilizing quantum fax machines to teleport to another universe. I think the filmmakers may have thought the same thing about this bizarre reaction, because they have this version of Chris say something directly opposed to it: ""This could be my grandparent's house in Oregon.""However, I think it fails to be a special movie because it cuts out so much of the world-building Crichton did that created a foreign and tense atmosphere for the characters to survive within for 2.5 days. This movie comes across as generic and forgettable medieval action that we've seen countless times before.There are some reviewers on here that have read the novel and think that rating the film 1 star and listing the changes the film made is a legitimate way to approach a work adapted for a different medium. They point out changes without even trying to explain why they think it was a bad change - they just assume that any changes are inherently bad.Some of these changes still leave me wondering what they were thinking (changing Kramer to a man), but most of the others I can understand what the filmmakers were going for. Changing Chris from a student of Professor Johnston to his son helped create a justification for him being part of the team to rescue Johnston in 1357, which I believe Crichton did not adequately do. Most of the plot points and sequences that were cut make sense to me, too, though some are definitely disappointing. The biggest and most central plot elements were kept in the film, and the time travel adventure plays out in the same way as the novel.The last thing I want to do in this review is again respond to other reviews. Some claim that the ending was changed. Again, all the major points of the ending of the novel were kept for the third act of the film, though the details may differ. It ends with a big nighttime battle for La Roque castle. Johnston and Marek are in the castle, tasked with making incendiaries for Oliver. The arsenal eventually explodes Chris and Kate are trying to get to La Roque, and find a secret passage to do it. Arnaut also uses the secret passage to enter La Roque, and ends up killing Oliver. Chris, Kate and Johnston use a marker to leave, while Marek chooses to stay. Doniger is sent back to mid-14th century Dordogne, where he certainly dies soon after. The three survivors later find Marek and Lady Claire's grave. Novel / Film both end.There are differences in details for each beat, but the only significant change is that Lady Claire's final scene in the book had happened before Marek was captured by Oliver, and she had no role in the climactic battle. This was the only structural change to the ending, and I don't think it's enough to justify the blanket statement ""they changed the ending"" without clarifying that the changes were mostly minor and stayed true to how they happened in the book.",Timeline

It was probably agreed upon to do this film at a maximun of 120 minutes. Donner felt compelled to do all he could to condense this novel into that time. The first 50 pages of the novel filled up the first 5 minutes of the movie. With that there was no foundation to draw the audience into the movie like the book did through its introduction. Peter Jackson or James Cameron could have put 30 more minutes into it, and it would have been set up better (1) Dumbifying quantum theory and the believability of passing from one universe to another; 2) Character development). Unfortunately this was not done. The editing was done at such a furious pace that unless you read the book you were left confused - any viewer would then feel kind of stupid. You may be asking why keep it to two hours - I could only guess more showings on opening weekend means more $$$.On a positive note when I saw the movie I had a rough day dealing with the crazyness of life - car problems etc. - this was a great escape to take my family to, and see it with a close friend and his family. We all liked it, and felt refreshed after leaving - the 2 hours went by so fast because it did capture us all. The battle scenes were spectacular and the brutality of the middle ages were deeply felt.

I count at least (AT LEAST!) 4 conversations where almost everyone in the cast speaks or shouts at the same time (presumably in heated argument), but the only reaction I get is the need to throttle all characters--including those yelling aloud their plans when they are supposedly trying to be secret--and thus quiet-- about their actions.)My other gripe is on casting Paul Walker.  Why?!  WHY?!  The minute I heard his voice...that intonation, that lack of emotion ...my mind said:  ""Look, it's Keanu Reeves part II!""And although the battle scene was good to look at, it certainly was not suspenseful, nor was it special (the standard already having been set by LOTR, the Two Towers).  All I could hear were giggles and laughter from the audience during the ""serious"" dialogue, so woodenly delivered that I could only put my face in my hands.  (Although, to be fair, I must mention that there was at least ONE audience member who was captivated...he was sitting up in his chair, leaning forward...and I will never understand why.)Other offenses include a seriously hastily pasted-together ending, where only incomprehensible insanity must be the motivation for characters to act the way they do.

Everything worked according so that everything in the present time at the beginning of the movie, happens later in the movie while the characters are in the past. One element that didn't work with this though is that Marek was found at the end in a tomb from the past. This is not correct because for this to happen, it would have to mean that he was never in the present time and he was always in the past.

Personally, I have read the book and I was able to explain it to my friend.  When I first read it, I knew that one day someone would make it into a movie.  But I had envisioned it with actors such as Tom Cruise or Richard Gere or some of those types.  But when I saw Paul Walker cast as Chris, all I could think about was the Fast and the Furious.  His emotionless acting really could have been replaced with a child, who could perhaps show some more enthusiasm or sadness or being frightened.  But I think that the script and the ideas that were in the book were dumbed down for the audience.  But I also believe that many of Crichton's books that are made into movies have many ideas left out.  Crichton's books are very scientific and the ideas that he puts into his books seem as if they could happen. Because of all the scientific vocabulary and the sheer extent that he goes to support it all.  I believe that the director was following the precedent laid down by other directors who have interpreted Crichton's works.  But the movie could have been done better and that really goes without saying.  If you like battle scenes and a little bit of suspense, then I believe you won't be wasting your money.

I love time travel notions and action books. The plot isn't complicated and the book is an easy read. The hard part is understanding how Crichtons time travel scenario works, but it is explained in a very comfortable manner.The story is intriguing, involving, well researched and opens up like a film, thats Crichtons style.

A group of high school kids with an 8mm camera probably could have done a better job of staying true to the original story. They didn't even try to maintain the characters as portrayed in the book. Marek was supposed to be a big blond guy, and in the movie he was a mediocre brown haired guy. I just don't understand why, when books are made into movies, nobody seems to be able to stay true to the book. This movie barely made an effort at all.

Do NOT watch this movie.  You cannot get the wasted hours back.

And, they could have at least made SOME attempt to have the characters speak in 14th century (sounding) languages and used subtitles to give it a more authentic feel.

His transformation from a somewhat cowardly person to a hero is central to the book.Andre was the guy Kate depended on in the beginning.

This was a ""fun"" movie, in my unprofessional opinion.The only thing that really had any saving grace to it was Gerard Butler's performance. His character was the only one I felt had any real depth. I'd seen him in ""Dracula 2000"" (another ""fun"" movie) and also in a mini-series about Attila the Hun, and I liked him in both of those too (which is why I wanted to see this).The thing that bothers me most is the language. You have these people from the 20th (21st? when did this come out?) century going back in time to the Middle Ages, and everyone is speaking Modern English and French. Medieval languages are totally different than Modern languages. They might have been able to write to each other, but they would not have been able to speak to each other. Why did no one think to bring a linguist along? No, they just brought a French interpreter who gets killed in the first 30 minutes - not that he would have been able to do much interpreting anyway...I enjoy Michael Crichton's books, but whenever a movie is made based on one, I've been kind of disappointed (with the exception of ""The 13th Warrior"" but that wasn't really written my Michael Crichton anyway - it was ""compiled"").

A pity, since it wasn't the lack of money that made this film a flop in my eyes. The acting could be a lot worse, but all in all it wasn't inspired, so Donner may have been on drugs during this shoot. I have plenty of other explanations, all equally outrageous, but that is what happens when a logical explanation about the poor quality cannot be found.",Timeline

But it's not every day you get a 600 year old letter from your father just a couple of days before the big battle in Castleguard.I would recommend this movie to someone with a little bit of interest in history, it doesn't have to be big, and like these actors since I think they have a special way of acting, that is kind of intense, which not all people like.

I rented it first and liked it so much I bought it. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi movies for their entertainment value. I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons. I think the whole story came together smoothly. Overall the acting was good, however Paul Walker would probably benefit from a few more classes. Gerard Butler was awesome in his role as Marek.

357,lyrabeluqua,This movie sucked (why can't I shout? *confused*),1,28 March 2005,"SPOILERS AHEADThis movie SUCKED. Absolutely SUCKED. Anyone who's read the book knows what I mean, and half of you guys that have read the book are only complaining about what's missing! I was expecting stuff to be cut out. Duh the tournament scene would be cut out, and they couldn't have the timing perfect (6 hours vs 37), and they couldn't explain the science of quantum foam, multiple universes, or quantum computers, that took up at least 50 pages in the book. I was expecting all of that to be missing (and I was proved right, it was all gone) but they CHANGED THE PLOT!!!! I wasn't expecting THAT. How can no one complain about that?? In the book Claire was the niece, or some relation, to the English Lord Oliver, but in the movie she was the sister to Arnough (sp?) That made a HUGE difference seeing as they made it so that the English held her captive so that Arnough wouldn't attack them. But in the book Arnough didn't care about Claire, and in the book Claire was hardly even an important character, let alone on the good side. Claire was on both sides, or at least that's what I got from the book. And on to Kate and Chris, they made the romance between them WAY bigger than it was in the book. Towards the end they showed some romantic interest and obviously there was the very end when Crichton told us they were married. But in the movie they kissed what, a half hour into the movie? *roll eyes* it figures... On the subject of romance the only thing they got right in the book was Marek and Claire, they got basically everything right about them.... except that romantic ride in those weird boats on the river.... what was that anyways? And why did they change the characters? They always seem to do that in Crichton's books into movies.... In Jurassic Park the kids sexes were switched... sort of... the older one was a boy in the book but was a girl in the movie. And in Timeline the book Kramer is a woman and in the movie they made her a man! And Gordon? He didn't even go BACK, let alone DIE!! Why'd they kill him off anyways?! God.... And the Proffesor was NOT Chris's father!!! And they made Chris so much more stupid than he actually was. They made him seem like he wasn't even a historian, but he was! He was just very very absorbed with himself.... *grr* That movie was a REALLY big disappointment. the only thing I'm going to give it is that if I hadn't read the book first, it would have been a good movie.

Granted, translating a book into a book into a movie requires a few changes to the author's original work, but the liberties taken with this particular novel are awful. Aside from cheap/cheesy looking period costumes and bad acting (although I think that the screenplay is probably a big reason why the acting is so bad, given that there are some incredibly talented actors in this film), any fan of Michael Crichton knows that the central theme to nearly everything he writes taps into the dangers of people believing that they can exert complete control over technology without regards for the consequences.

I'm also a huge Crichton fan, and his books that have been made into films have so far fared OK.This was the exception. From the outset to the finish, i cringed with horror. Apart from the complete lack of acting talent in the main characters (maybe Marek was OK), the direction was mind numbing and the script doesn't even make toilet paper grade, the plot having more holes in it than my old tea strainer. It's hard to find anything positive in this film, apart from the relief of seeing the end credits. Where did the science and technology go?

They leave out huge sections of back story, change important details so they make little to no sense in the movie. It was just awful!

I have often thought how terribly difficult it would be to have lived then, without the amenities we enjoy today.I thought the actors were all very good, and even though the ""feel"" of the book and movie are different, I liked them both.

The costumes see pretty accurate along with the weaponry the graphics are pretty good as well. What this movie lacks is logic, it simply isn't there. I realize that it would have been hard to make this movie a decent length and still explain how things work in a better way but it should have been done. Being so open ended led to the demise of this movie in the analytical thinkers mind. Having said that though I also think as long as you haven't read the book and you make sure to not think too hard about the movie you will enjoy it. This movie starts out very slow and by the first 25 minutes you can tell whether you're going to like it or not. Paul Walker plays Chris Johnston son of E.A. Johnston the head archaeologist on a dig site that is over top Castlegard France. Chris apparently hates archeology but for some reason he is at an archaeological dig which is completely illogical. Whatever though he must be there because he is infatuated with his father's young assistant. The father leaves urgently then next thing you know he is missing so in attempts to find him they call the employer that called him for help(only a day or two has passed in the movie making no sense why they're panicked about his whereabouts). This leads you to the BIGGEST problem of this movie. Chris and a group of his dads' followers go to this company to get answers and apparently there is a company that has developed a teleportation device. They give no explanation to how it works until later in the movie but guess what they built a ""time machine"" that apparently doesn't actually do anything for itself it is just connected to a random wormhole. (This is that point where the title is named for because this is terribly illogical I mean really???) They also get these little clicker devices that apparently do they teleporting back part and without it you can't teleport back. (They also said they sent apples through this and it came back how did the apple use the clicker? Or the camera they sent I mean really) so at this point we are less than thirty minutes into the movie and I'm sure your thinking OMG why would I watch this. Honestly if you just don't over analyze the movie it won't bug you. OK let's get back on track so the group ends up getting set up to travel through time to rescue Chris' father and they are also assigned three employees to aid them in their endeavor. This part actually makes sense the company takes everything modern from these individuals and dresses them in medieval garb before they send them back(OK movie is going to redeem itself with logic =P). Once the group is geared they get teleported to the past and immediately someone is running yelling to hide in French so everyone does the logical thing and hides. EXCEPT the two former marines who are supposed to be this awesome combat support. They just stay right on the path and get killed of course (from here forward there actually is logic so in other words it begins to be enjoyable). OK so now the remaining group is in the past and on the hunt for Chris' dad and they are greeted with many medieval problems including getting locked up killing death and war. The group gets split up and they have to fight their way to be reunited and escape the past. I spoiled the first half hour so I won't spoil the good parts for you. That is if you think you can make it through the first thirty minutes. All in all this movie isn't that great but if you're bored and have nothing else to watch you probably wouldn't regret it.",Timeline

The book is certainly the worst book I have ever read, and I love science fiction. The science is interesting, but the way the book is written, the plotting, characterisation and the whole motivation is deeply deeply flawed. I haven't read any other Crighton, and on the strength of this I have given the film a wide berth. It seems that mega-authors suffer from weak editors, like super-directors suffer from weak producers. Someone should be looking over their shoulder and pointing out the crap before the public has to suffer it.",Timeline

Archaeologists have usually been portrayed as peaceful, enthusiastic scientists. I expected them to be overjoyed with the prospect of visiting an historical period for which they have an interest. However, even before they arrive in the midst of a medieval war they have all had several turns at arguing with each other. Even the scientists who developed the technology cannot agree amongst themselves. I did not seem to miss anything during a coffee break during which I did not pause the movie nor did anything important occur when I fast forwarded for a few minutes. Timeline is a fast paced action movie with a science fiction foundation and seemingly authentic medieval conflict. I would recommend this movie for a rainy day or late night insomnia.

Maybe it wasn't historically correct but hey!! it's still an interesting and suspenseful movie, I jumped more than once. To see David Thewlis (Lupin from Harry Potter -Escape From Azkaban), Peter Neal McDonough (from Boomtown) in another picture was an added bonus. Too bad David was a bad person in this one but he sure got his just rewards. It was pure fantasy, a wonderful escape from every day problems - - just sit back and try to figure out how the pieces of the puzzle were all coming together - - Anna Friel as Lady Claire was perfect for Butler's Marek. I can't believe how easily Butler can slip into completely different roles - - he's really a marvelous actor and I absolutely love his accent, wish I could listen to him talk all day and night!

My first impression was that it was a really good movie even though the costuming seemed low-budget. I thought the casting was very precise (especially Gerard Butler), though the acting sometimes could seem on-the-spot. My friends and I did find Paul Walker's character absolutely clueless at times and by the end of the movie were laughing and making jokes when he said words like Sarcophagus. It had to be the longest word he said in the whole film.Then, I read the book. Actually, I just finished it a couple of hours ago. I suppose that I can see why people are in such an uproar over it. If you made a movie that truly follows the book, you would hardly think that it was based off of the same book as Richard Donner's movie. Some people like the book better, some like the movie. I personally can't compare the two. The characters are different, the locations of things, and the events that take place are all different. The thing that I believe really sets people off, is that this movie was publicised with trailers full of scenes that actually look quite similar to the book (with a few, minor exceptions). They get all excited, go to the movies, shell out their 10 bucks, sit down, watch the movie, and as time goes on they start wondering more and more, ""Am I in the right theatre?""Overall, the movie Timeline was quite enjoyable. It had suspense, thrill, and some pretty cute guys in leggings if I may say. If you haven't read the book, go ahead and rent it and see how you like it.

One by one the characters dropped liked flies in acts of pointless violence. It didn't help the storyline to kill off half a dozen or so characters. There were plot loopholes left and right.

The dialect of French spoken in the 21st century is VERY different from that spoken in the 14th century.3-Interference- From the moment they arrived in the 14th century they altered time immeasurably! Between killing English soldiers and saving French ones to saving Lady Clair (her death was the reason the French so fierce in battle), instead they gave her a ""fairy tale"" ending! Then there is Sir William De Kere / William Decker a 21 century refugee. How can he just assume an identity 600 years in the past?

373,mercury_stardust,Do yourself a favour and read the book instead,1,2 October 2005,"After coming across the book quite by accident and ending up loving every page of it I was over the moon to know that they were making a movie out of it. This was just after I'd seen the last installment of the wonderfully executed Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, so I thought at last people are making really good adaptations! How wrong I was though. Yes it is hard for any film maker to condense the content of a book into a 2 hour time period, but when they completely change characters that really makes me mad. Marek is supposed to have studied medieval ways for years and years, skilled in archery, jousting and customs of the period. He is even supposed to be able to speak the language. Not only that, Marek is FRENCH, not Scottish. I really feel that the casting of the film left soooo much to be desired. Paul Walker just doesn't seem comfortable in the role, to me he seemed very inadequate, and that's not to say I don't like him because I do enjoy other movies he is in. In the book, Marek and Chris are in a fantastic jousting sequence, which I was very much looking forward to seeing in film, obviously it never made an appearance. I've seen movies where a 3 day time period has been satisfactorily condensed into say 2 and a half hours, no problem. For the film makers to then change it completely and say they can only be there for 6 hours dramatically reduces the amount of material from the actual book that is able to be used. It is the characters and their relationships that mostly make this such a poor film. Chris and Kate do not suddenly fall in love, the professor is NOT Chris's father, Chris has the hots for Lady Claire- who is very manipulative and NOT Arnaut's sister, Marek doesn't really show any interest in her until the end. Many of the characters hair colour and general appearance -clearly described in the book- are very wrong, and Kramer is supposed to be a woman NOT a man! Same with one of the soldiers, incidentally who are both supposed to die within minutes of arriving in the middle ages. I could go on and on about how many faults there are with this adaptation, but suffice to say the movie is a poor excuse, a waste of film and only based very very loosely on an excellent book.",Timeline

Unfortunately I decided to stay anyway, hoping it could possibly redeem itself. That was another mistake.

Wow :)If you want a Star Wars moment (celebrity characters and glitzy cgi fakery) I suggest you pass.One of the many things I am excited about is how the main characters soon find themselves taken from the slow, calm world of archaeology to the real living (smelly, scary, confusing) world they have only been imaging and (the most impressive part for me) they discover they are no longer the main characters! Great story - great acting - great pace - you really have to pay attention to keep up. I watched it on video on a movie size screen, and I stopped it three or four times to digest what had happened at several points. I love how so many people keep emerging, and they all seem to be individuals - no cartoon, decorative, or simpleton ghosts, they each have their own foibles and motivations, and they are all swept up in this whirlwind that is bigger than they are.Whew! I am stunned at how the leading actors are part of the story, and not just given screen time to show their faces - the story really moves with little regard for them while they try to catch up! They all show why they are career pros, and elevate the production.I like this movie because I like history and I think it gives the feeling most people would really have if ever this happened. This way it emotionally took me on the journey with them. Sometimes you have a role to play, sometimes you shut up and run like heck, and sometimes you watch what is happening and try to collect your wits.Superb! I don't like violence, and had I known this film had the violence I probably would have skipped it, but it was treated with enough emotional weight and honesty that I just held on and hoped for the best for everyone. It isn't gory, and unlike many movies, even the 'bad guys' were given the respect to be shown as human, which I feel lifts the entire experience from Hollywood flash to a work worth the effort and trust of all the cast and crew.Bravo!I've read reviews on imdb for maybe 6 or 8 years, and registered now, specifically to leave a review for this great film. I have only read a few other reviews, and it seems some people had expectations that were disappointed.

I would definitely watch it again if I have time. When I first saw the trailer I was dragged in before I knew it I had the Timeline DVD in my hand. It was without a doubt the greatest movies of the year. Now it's 3 years later and yet I still love it. Every actors and actresses had played an excellent role of possessing the spirits of the characters. Paul Walker had developed the skills of acting, I'm sure we will see good things from him. Even for me the person who almost failed history in school could enjoy the conflict of the past. I hope that we will see lots more of these Sci-fi movies soon in theater!",Timeline
