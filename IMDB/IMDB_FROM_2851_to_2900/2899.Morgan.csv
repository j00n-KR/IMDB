0,Leofwine_draca,Hits the mark,6,5 August 2019,"MORGAN is a familiar, small-scale thriller set at the usual remote research facility that's so frequently the setting for films these days; such plots usually involve robots or sinister experiments invariably going wrong. MORGAN is a case in point. It's about a synthetic human and her interactions with the team of scientists looking after her. This film was made by Ridley Scott's son Luke, who doesn't seem to have inherited much of his dad's panache, although this turns out to be perfectly serviceable as it stands. There are some fun twists and moments of violence that don't hold back, and a particularly distinguished cast that includes Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh and Jennifer Jason Leigh in various roles; Ridley must have called in a few favours to make this a star-studded production. Kate Mara is a fine lead, and the film, while never wowing, often hits the mark.",Morgan
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting idea but needs to be thought out more,5,4 June 2017,"A group of scientists has created Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). She/It has certain abilities and attacks Dr. Kathy Grieff (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) is brought in to evaluate Morgan and the program. She's risk management from corporate. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh) and Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones) are the senior scientists. Dr. Amy Menser (Rose Leslie) has an affinity for Morgan. Psychologist Dr. Alan Shapiro (Paul Giamatti) evaluates Morgan's emotional stability.This tries to be an interesting sci-fi. Some may compare this to Ex Machina. It would not be a favorable comparison. It needs to rethink the protagonist and who should that be. Lee has certain attributes which makes her a difficult rooting interest. That ties into the twist/reveal. By the end, the reveal is not shocking as much as it's perfunctory. After a couple of fights with Morgan, one could guess at the reveal. Also, the scientists don't act right although I put that to Morgan's mental influence. This is a good sci-fi Twilight Zone idea but it needs more thoughtful developing.",Morgan
2,Prismark10,Only human,4,15 July 2017,"Luke Scott is the son of Ridley Scott. Morgan is in some ways is a cut down version of Blade Runner with a twist that is similar to one of the many versions of the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, the one with Harrison Ford having a dream sequence.Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) is a stern and confident risk management specialist for a genetic engineering company who have created an experimental human hybrid called Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is smarter than humans with an advanced growth rate. Morgan looks like a teenager although she is only 5 years old.After a violent incident Morgan has lost her privileges such as going outside. Lee believes that the Morgan project is too dangerous as she might be too unpredictable. A psychologist (Paul Giamatti) pushes Morgan to the edge when he suggests that she should be terminated. Morgan escapes, she is volatile and lashes out. Lee follows her and is willing to take Morgan down however she can.The film is derivative, slow and not really interesting. A film about artificial life forms only comes to life in the last quarter. If you want a debate about the 'measure of a man' watch one of those episodes of Star Trek:The Next Generation where they would debate the status of Data the android.",Morgan
3,nogodnomasters,Did you ever feel like yourself,8,9 October 2017,"Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a creation of artificial DNA using nano technology to accelerate growth. Morgan injures a member of the staff and Lee (not Merry) Weathers goes to the facility to conduct a corporate risk assessment. The film starts out as slow burn science fiction, but keeps you engaged, especially when Paul Giamatti shows up to conduct a psychic evaluation. At this time the film takes off. It is comparable to other films that have more action, which I hesitate to mention for plot considerations.I liked the somewhat expected twist as I began to fear a Steinbeck ending. More science fiction than horror.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Morgan
4,kosmasp,Feelings,8,17 April 2017,"If you like Science Fiction horror, there is almost no way around this. Especially with a stellar cast like this. And while you may see a couple of things coming (it does have a very straightforward structure), there are things that you may not see. Let's say I was positively surprised at what direction this went. And I really liked the ending, which is always a make or break deal.Science Fiction low budget movies that are actually good are not that common, therefor it's a joy to see something like that being done. I also like the fact that there is a lot of female talent at hand. Which goes to show you that there are a lot of women out there who can pull their own weight, if given the chance. So go ahead and give it a chance too",Morgan
5,lee_eisenberg,"Will the ""wrong"" kind of humans take over?",5,27 December 2016,"Ever since Karel Čapek introduced the idea of robots in ""R.U.R."", artificial beings and artificial intelligence have played a diverse role in popular culture. Probably the most famous instance was Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", wherein a computer develops human qualities. Luke Scott's ""Morgan"" focuses on a human hybrid who has become violent. It's an interesting movie, not a great one. There are some intense scenes with the hybrid, and how Kate Mara's risk assessment specialist tries to deal with her. I guess that any technological advancement involving artificial intelligence is going to create these risks, as well as ethical debates about such a creation.In the end, the movie is worth seeing. I really liked the last few minutes of the movie.",Morgan
6,jboothmillard,Morgan,5,8 September 2016,"I saw the trailer for this creepy looking film just days before it was released and I went to see it in the cinema, I was intrigued by both the good names in the cast, and I hoped it would be interesting as well, directed by Luke Scott, son of Sir Ridley. Basically slightly-built and self-contained young woman Lee Weathers (Fantastic Four's Kate Mara) is a risk-assessment specialist from a company funding research projects devoted to creating artificial human beings, she is called in to investigate an incident. Lee is dispatched to a remote location where one of the company's most promising experiment projects, a human hybrid called Morgan (Atlantis's Anya Taylor-Joy), has violently lashed out at Dr. Kathy Grieff (Jennifer Jason Leigh), she had a ""tantrum"", and stabbed her in the eye with a pen. Lee goes into a discussion with the scientists at dinner, also revealing she is fluent in Chinese, she discusses a previous incident with the lead scientists Dr. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh) and Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones), at Helsinki another experiment went wrong, most of the team of scientists were killed. Psychologist Dr. Alan Shapiro (Paul Giamatti) is brought in to interview Morgan, with Lee and the scientists observing, Shapriro wants to see how much she understands human emotions, and slowly taunts and provokes her to get some kind of reaction, she does react and violently kills Dr. Shapiro, Lee realises she is too unpredictable, especially given her enhanced intelligence and strength, and must be terminated. The scientists have raised Morgan from birth, she is only five years old, but has grown to a teenage status owing to her enhanced growth rate, they have grown attached to her and cannot bring themselves to kill her, Lee plans to do so herself, but she is injected with a sedative and imprison her in Morgan's glass cell. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan, but she instead kills them one by one, while Dr. Ziegler elsewhere kills himself, Morgan kidnaps her favourite handler Dr. Amy Menser (Rose Leslie), Cheng in the house is recording an apology that the experiment has failed, hinting a ""more human"" creation was being attempted, but the result has become uncontrollable, she finishes and Morgan enters to kill her. Lee manages to escape her cell, with her extensive martial arts abilities, Skip Vronsky (Boyd Holbrook) finds her and a car chase ensues through the woods as Morgan tries to escape with Amy, until Lee and Morgan have a final showdown with a highly physical fight, which ends with Lee impaled on a fallen tree branch sticking out. Morgan leaves her to bleed, only for her to miraculously revive, Lee catches up to her and drowns her in the nearby lake, she proceeds to shoot Amy, she also shoots Skip, leaving no witnesses to what happened. In the end the executives at the company who funded Morgan's creation, including Jim Bryce (Brian Cox), sit in conference and calmly discuss the events, it is revealed that Lee is actually an earlier prototype of the human hybrid, she is apparently the ""perfect"" artificial human all this time. Also starring Michael Yare as Ted Brenner, Chris Sullivan as Dr. Darren Finch, The A Word's Vinette Robinson as Dr. Brenda Finch, Crispian Belfrage as Charles Grimes and Jonathan Aris as David Chance. Mara is good as the steely trouble-shooter, Jones and Yeoh are alright as the ones in the white coats, Taylor-Joy is certainly creepy and unpredictable lab-grown synthetic human, and Giamatti steals the show with his probing session to reach the AI's emotional limits, this scene is the highlight of the film. This film is mirroring cyborg-themed film Ex Machina, there are many similarities, with the questions of what it means to be human, it is calm the first half, then it races with high-octane chases and action, I agree with critics the change in pace makes the film go a different direction than it could of, and you can probably guess the twist towards the end, but overall the tension is maintained, it is an interesting science fiction mystery thriller. Worth watching!",Morgan
7,paul_haakonsen,Mediocre result of what should have been good...,5,26 June 2019,"Granted, while the concept of the storyline told in ""Morgan"" was quite interesting, then the movie fell short somehow. I guess it was because the movie was so generic and predictable. There was nothing offered to the audience throughout the entire course of the movie that you didn't see coming a mile away, well maybe except for the ending of the movie. That, I will admit, I hadn't seen coming.Anya Taylor-Joy, playing Morgan, was actually quite well cast with her inability to portray emotions on the screen. And the make-up department definitely also should have some praise for there was a very distinct non-human like feel emanating from her.The movie actually has some pretty interesting cast members on the list, including the likes of Toby Jones, Brian Cox, Michelle Yeoh and Paul Giamatti. And while they did individually put on good performances, they just weren't able to transcend the mediocrity that permeated the movie given the linear script.I am guessing that writer Seth W. Owen was aiming for a story which was meant to get the audience thinking about artificial life and its impact. But, for me at least, it just didn't manifest or manage to take root. And director Luke Scott was left with a script and storyline that was just, well, bland.""Morgan"" definitely was watchable and semi-enjoyable, but it is hardly a movie that will ever make it to my screen a second time. The movie just scraped by as it was the first time.",Morgan
8,Coventry,"Do paranoid androids dream of electric sheep? Nope, of killing their creators!",5,16 January 2020,"""Morgan"" is the name of an android, a piece of artificial intelligence, created in all secrecy by a team of devout scientists, in a lab somewhere hidden in a remote and forestry region. Before you start praising the downright magnificent make-up effects on the girl, bear in mind it's actress Anya Taylor-Joy's real face. She's a really good and talented young actress, but admittedly she has a bit of a weird face, which - luckily for her - helps to obtain interesting roles as the ""outcast-girl"" (also in ""Split""). Anyways, Morgan is only five years old, but she already looks like an adolescent and she behaves like a spoiled teenager. Lately, there have been serious issues with Morgan, and she even stabbed one of her creators in the eye. Corporate headquarters sends out emotionally numb but highly professional risk-manager Lee Weathers to assess if ""Project Morgan"" should be terminated or not. Needless to say, Morgan's makers grew to love her as if she were a real child, and they will not accept that's she killed based on an evaluation by an outsider. Director Luke Scott (son of Ridley who made the Sci-Fi landmarks ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"") initially tries hard to make ""Morgan"" is a very ambitious, existential and emotionally challenging Sci-Fi/thriller, but he can't prevent that it turns into a rather ordinary 'stalk & slash' type of B-horror. There are a handful of terrific sequences, notably the scene with Paul Giamatti as the obnoxious auditor, but it's ultimately too lightweight to be considered a significant genre effort. Scott Jr. managed to gather an impressive cast (including Brian Cox, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Toby Jones, Paul Giamatti) and the special effects are more than adequate, but I doubt anyone will remember ""Morgan"" in ten years' time.",Morgan
9,LeonLouisRicci,Empty Headed & Humorless...Worth a Watch for the Action & Atmospheric Dread,7,30 March 2017,"Most of the A-List Star Casting seem to Show Up as a Favor for Ridley Scott to Help His Son Luke in His Directorial Debut.Because Toby Jones, Paul Giamatti, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Brian Cox all have Screen Time that Amounts to Nothing More than an Extended Cameo.The Story of an Artificially Created Clone/Humanoid/Robot has become so Familiar as to barely Rate a Blip on Our ""Species"" Radar. So here's another ""Submitted for Your Approval"".Comparisons to the Multitude of Previous Pics are Inevitable, Predictable, and frankly the Attacks on this and others of its Type are as Worn Out as the Formula. This Film Feels Short. Not only the Running Time but the Concept, Characters, and Execution. To Call it Compact would be Accurate. Not much Time is spent on Philosophy, Ethics, or Philip K. Dick-isms.It just Presents it all in a Slick, Hyper-Kinetic Style where the Humans are as One-Dimensional as Their Creations, and it does it all with Zero Humor. It's Deadly Serious, Dour, and Oh-So Empty Headed where Nobody Dares Smile or Say Anything Intelligent for that matter.But the Action is Rough and Tumble and the Violence is Sharp. Kate Mara's Stone Face is put to Good Use and the Buttoned-Up, Starched Shirts and Short Cropped Hair can't Hide Her Beauty. Anna-Taylor Joy as ""Morgan"" is also an Attractive, albeit Creepy Presence. But who Decided to put Her in that Silly Hoodie.Overall, it's Worth a Watch for the ""Girls With Guns"" Crowd and others with Low Expectations. It's a Shallow and Slick Eight Million Dollar B-Movie that Action Fans will Like but Sci-Fi Types, Not So Much.",Morgan
10,zardoz-13,Solid But Unsurprising Saga About Artificial Intelligence,5,23 March 2017,"You've seen it done before, and you've seen it better, but freshman director Luke Scott's ""Morgan"" isn't awful. Mind you, it lacks the intelligence of ""Ex Machina""; it lacks the adventure of ""Hanna""; it isn't as outlandish as ""Splice,"" and it isn't the trend-setting spectacle that was ""Blade Runner."" Ridley Scott's son Luke has staged a solid but rarely surprising sci-fi thriller that benefits from sturdy production designs, persuasive performances from a crackerjack cast, and first-rate cinematography with beautiful scenery. The biggest problem with ""Morgan"" is ""Peepers"" scenarist Seth Owens' screenplay never pushes the envelope with its ""Frankenstein"" premise. Thoroughly underwhelming throughout, this flawlessly lensed potboiler with its surprise ending that doesn't amount to much of a disclosure will hold your attention during its meager 92 minutes, but you won't emerge from the experience saying ""Wow!"" Sadly, if you never saw ""Morgan,"" you wouldn't be missing anything. Owens' script concerns the obscure corporation named SynSect and the investigation that it has launches about a hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision-making and sophisticated emotional responses genetically modified clone under development which has malfunctioned (think Michael Crichton's ""Westworld"") and it dispatches a risk management consultant, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara of ""The Fantastic Four""), to assess the damage. Basically, this low-budget, science fiction outing doesn't shower us with a lot of special effects, aside from standard-issue banks of monitors and computers in a striking but remote architectural setting. The eponymous character Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") is never shown like Alicia Vikander in ""Ex Machina"" as a stripped down, half-robotic chassis. She wears a hoodie, and she doesn't emphasize her femininity. Neither is she as advanced as the androids in ""Ex Machina."" Comparatively, ""Morgan"" shares more in common with ""Hanna,"" except ""Hanna"" wasn't confined to a claustrophobic setting, and Hanna embarked on a journey of initiation. Like ""Hanna,"" virtually everybody connected with Morgan died a hideous death. Everything in ""Morgan"" occurs in and around the clandestine facility where the scientists conjured up the character, apart from a post-script scene in an urban locale where corporate approves the action taken by Weathers and washes their hands of any remorse.""Morgan"" breaks down neatly into a three-act structure. Lee Weathers cruises off the beaten path to a research and development facility where she meets the scientists who have devoted their genius to creating Morgan, now a five-year old in the body of a teenager, and investigates an accident where Morgan smashed up a scientist's eye. Scott and Owen provide us with flashback footage of Morgan as a tyke and we soak in the family atmosphere of the place that emanates from the collaborative feelings of the scientists. They are strongly protective of Morgan and they remain suspicious of Lee Weathers who poses a threat to their research. The last thing that these scientists worry about is having their cyborg destroyed and their research wasted. In a sense, the ending with its revelation about Lee Weathers seems like a neatly wrapped package. It strikes me that the corporation, if it were greedy, would have taken Morgan elsewhere and reassigned the scientists to other projects. Instead, the corporation destroys the robot that it created and then kills everybody associated with it so nothing about the project will ever see the light of day. Nothing in the aftermath of ""Morgan"" offers either us or the filmmakers with somewhere to go. The success of Lee Weathers isn't that interesting and the destruction of Morgan isn't as satisfying as it should have been. The murder of the family of scientists by either Morgan or Lee Weathers adds nothing except to seal everything into a nice, neat package that a sequel will never unwrap and analyze. The fate of ""Morgan"" is that it sticks to the formula but it never transforms the formula. Luke Scott is not without talent. By the third act of ""Morgan,"" Scott has changed his approach as the story intensifies. Restrained at the outset as everybody broods and Morgan makes her apologizes, ""Morgan"" concludes with an action-packed finale that Scott indulges in with a conspicuous lack of restraint, in other words, the camera-work is more active than passive than it was at the start. Again, the performances are all memorable. You feel more sympathetic toward the dedicated scientists who struggle to nurture Morgan but have been unable to discipline her than either the anonymity of Lee Weathers or the remorseful behavior of Morgan.",Morgan

This title character serves as a glorified crash test dummy amid a world in which all the actual people seem to be total idiots who have never seen modern movies, such as BLADE RUNNER, TERMINATOR, or EX MACHINA. Captain Morgan's brand of booze features some sort of cannibal on its labels, and the nut hasn't fallen very far from its tree with this namesake 'Bot.

Don't expect any internal consistency in MORGAN, as you get with Zombie flicks (""Three in the head ALWAYS leaves them dead!""). ""Ms. Weathers"" demonstrates that these 'Bots heal faster than the Wolverine, but are easier to drown out than silent screams.

Both plot lines are involving.Anya Taylor-Joy continues to impress - she commands the screen well and has a pleasing air of cold implacability while still conveying a sympathetic sense of vulnerability.And Kate Mara is a strong, if less sympathetic, presence too.This film worked well for me, and contained some interesting questions about the nature of self and humanity.",Morgan
14,anaconda-40658,A New Ex-Machina.,9,9 September 2016,"Morgan (2016): Dir: Luke Scott / Cast: Kate Mara, Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones, Rose Leslie, Paul Giamatti: Underrated science fiction thriller that mat remind viewers of Ex Machina. Kate Mara stars as Lee Weathers, a risk assessment specialist sent to evaluate a human hybrid named Morgan at a remote location. The subject, Morgan had stabbed one of the staff in the eye and doesn't seem overly clear on right or wrong. In flashbacks we are given insight into her close friendship with Dr. Amy Menser whom use to accompany Morgan on brief outdoor retreats until an incident occurred where Morgan killed a wounded deer. This will veer into a rousing action climax that is graphically brutal but satisfying in its clever twist ending. Mara as Lee is sufficient, stern and knows her job, and acts when Morgan breaks free. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the double sided Morgan who is presented as innocent but demonstrates a violent side. The staff are a mixed bag of Morgan defenders who view Lee as an intruder. Toby Jones heads the operation and immediately declares his stand on Lee's presence. Rose Leslie as Amy feels empathy for Morgan yet senses the control beginning to dwindle. Paul Giamatti plays a psychiatrist who shows up to review Morgan and ends up the victim of Morgan's latest assault. Directed by Luke Scott who shows promising footsteps behind his father. This is simple yet demonstrates a promise for greater things for him. It demonstrates our total lack of control and understanding of what eventually counters any grip that authority and society hopes to obtain. Score: 9 / 10",Morgan
15,FlashCallahan,Morgan Fair...Robotic......Child.....,4,4 December 2016,"Morgan is a very special girl who's an artificial being. Despite growing to the size of an adult within six months of being created, she still has the mind of a child, complete with temper tantrums. Kept in a remote location where she's cared for and monitored by a select staff of scientists who don't agree on whether Morgan is a ""she"" with feelings and rights or an ""it,"" Morgan becomes an uncontrollable and unpredictable force, putting them all in danger..........You would think that with the calibre of the cast, including Giamatti, Jones, Cox et al, that this should have been something very special, even though it's doing nothing more than trying to merge Ex-MACHINA with Splice, but it's nothing more than a tepid film with a twist that is evident once we see the 'star' of the movie.Mara plays an investigating agent who is tasked with deciding whether Morgan is safe enough to continue her existence, or whether she should be terminated.She's already given poor Jennifer Jason Leigh a decent wound to the eye, resulting in her role being nothing more than her explaining the origin of the titular character.Jones is the voice of reason, and Giamatti is the special guest star who is in it for nothing other than to vex the titular character, with predictable results.But this is by far the most entertaining part of the film.Mara completely ruins the movie, and although she is method acting to an extent that beggars belief, her character shouldn't have been so one dimensional, because the final shot will have you shouting nothing more than 'yep, knew that straight from the moment we saw her'.Despite the calibre of talent in front of and behind the camera, it's not a surprise that this vanished without a trace.It's pretentious, tries to be different, but has nothing new to offer.You will just experience Déjà Vu of much better films you've seen in the past.",Morgan

This is exactly what we have here, from American Horror Story to Game Of Thrones, every viewer will recognize his favorite.But does it all work together? Well, it works even as this flick isn't really my thing. The poster looked creepy but I can't say that this is a horror, this is a pure Sci-fi flick were an synthetic person is making failures and breaks out to destroy her creators, looks like the Frankenstein story. But it's up to one person to destroy it. A surprising end, that's a fact but it's a lot of characterization and blah blah. The action comes in in fight scenes but there isn't any moment that I thought, hell this is creepy like the poster showed. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad flick but for me a bit too low on everything.

A story about an artificially created humanoid being, it's not that we never saw something similar before, but that's the case for most movies. I thought it all fell a bit bland in the end. There are some flaws that bring down the credibility of the movie, for example when a normal car rams an iron gate you expect to have some severe damage at the front of your car, and in this case the car was scratchless. It's those kind of little details that bring down the quality of a movie. The acting was okay, nothing mindblowing but nothing cringing either. The quality of the images was good, looked all professional but that's not a guarantee for a good movie. I watched Morgan without much joy or suspense, just another movie I will forget everything about it in a couple days.",Morgan
18,siderite,Mediocre movie trying to capitalize on the success of Ex Machina,7,2 December 2016,"I have been waiting for this movie for a year, ever since I've seen the trailer that promised something akin to Ex Machina: a philosophical foray into the nature of consciousness. Instead we get an average sci-fi thriller with gaping script holes in an already boring and obvious story line.There isn't much more to say about it. Kate Mara does a good role, I quite like her in whatever she does, even if she doesn't dazzle with her acting skills. The other cast members are scraped from successful American and British TV shows and are there just for cannon fodder, wasting the potential of so many talented actors. As for Anya Taylor-Joy, she also continues to show her acting talent and may be the only thing that made me rate this film as average at all.Bottom line: if you don't go in with high expectations, like I did, you may enjoy the film. It's not really bad, only unspectacular in almost every way. It just screams ""wasted potential"" at you while you ask yourself why is a film with so much production value and good acting skill not doing anything for you.",Morgan
19,Hellmant,"Mara and Taylor-Joy are both excellent, in their female empowering leading roles!",9,7 September 2016,"'MORGAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi-horror-action flick, directed by Luke Scott (in his directorial debut). The film was co-produced by Luke's father (Ridley Scott), and his production company (Scott Free Productions). It was written by Seth W. Owen. The movie stars Kate Mara, Anya Taylor-Joy (of 'THE WITCH' fame), Rose Leslie, Boyd Holbrook, Michelle Yeoh, Toby Jones, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Paul Giamatti. It tells the story of a highly skilled risk-assessment consultant, who must decide whether to terminate a very advanced artificial humanoid being. The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also bombing at the Box Office. I highly enjoyed it!Morgan (Taylor-Joy) is an extremely advanced human hybrid; she looks and acts much like a normal human girl. She's highly emotionally unstable though, and she recently lashed out at a scientist (Leigh); by stabbing her (multiple times) in the eye with a pen. The company that funds the science experiment, hires a risk-management consultant, named Lee Weathers (Mara), to decide whether Morgan should be terminated. They send the specialist to the isolated location where Morgan's being held at, in order to decide whether the humanoid must be killed. Something goes terribly wrong.The movie definitely isn't the most high concept sci-fi thriller out there; it definitely doesn't rival Ridley's greatest films either (like 'BLADE RUNNER' or 'PROMETHEUS'), but it's still a lot of fun! The action scenes are awesome, it's emotionally involving, and it's also extremely intense (as well)! Mara and Taylor-Joy are both excellent, in their female empowering leading roles; and you couldn't have asked for a cooler supporting cast (not for this type of low-budget B-movie thriller). I think it's a pretty impressive debut film for Luke Scott!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Xm22965_JOo",Morgan
20,thesar-2,Morgan Freewoman,3,5 January 2017,"Seriously, just watch Ex Machina. It's 10x the movie this is.Actually, there are dozens of movies out there like Morgan. Many better, few worse. So, this is nothing new. Unfortunately, how they tried to ""shake things up"" is with a twist that's foreseen 8 or less minutes into the movie. What's left?Well, an all-star cast of great actors that, sadly, never excelled. Fairly good cinematography, but not explored enough. Interest in what Morgan can do, though never explained and the rules kept changing. Morgan is smart beyond smart without signs of how she acquired such knowledgeand never showing any intelligence in any one scene. Characters we care about with the motivations and actions of abnormal humans. And there are hot, girl-on-girl fight scenes filmed by a blind cameraman. Hey now. It's not my fault every positive I came up with the movie shot down.Morgan tells the now-ancient story of DNA manipulation, rapid growth and corporate greed. Morgan is the third attempt at creating life and after five years, she/it/buddy maims a staff member causing a suit from corporate to investigate the risk of their investment. Enter many subplots that begin, abruptly end or never explored, actions that make you wonder if even the cast were in on the script and tone-shift from sci-fi to sorta action, sorta horror and all predictable territory. After all I said above, I didn't hate on the movie. There were sparks that showed the director/writer had ideas and maybe they can be explored on future projects. Maybe they can learn from these mistakes.But for now, it's an ""eh"" or ""wtf"" film that wants to be much deeper than it appears on the very thin surface.***Final thoughts: The Fly II, Splice, Ex Machina, Alien: Resurrection, Jurassic Park(s) and Frankenstein are just the movies off the top of my head this film mimicked. I am sure there are countless othersif I did research. Not worth it. Just know this isn't the first A.I.D.N.A-gone- bad story.",Morgan

I don't like to watch a lot of previews because they tend to give too much away so I really had no idea what to expect from this. What I discovered was that I really really liked this. The movie had a type of Ex-Machina meets Hanna feel. The movie hits you with really emotion, action and makes you wonder what is real, what is right and who is in the wrong. The more the movie went on the more you questioned each persons motives. The best aspect of this movie though are the constant twists. I watch so many movies that I can usually predict what will happen about 5 minutes in, this one I could not. When that happens I get excited and end up liking the movie more. This isn't really one you can talk about without giving things away but I will say this movie is a surprise and I recommend it.

24,tabuno,A Cynical and Amazing Look At A.I. Sci Fi.,9,12 January 2019,"4 September 2016. Ridley Scott's son has put together an icy, cynical, but very intense and psychologically tight sci fi thriller. I assume that many audience members will overlook the superb acting and directing especially when it comes to Morgan, the primary character. What's really difficult to evaluate is the basic underlying premise and twist in the movie which isn't likely to endear audience members with its distinctly anti-audience pleasing expectations. What this movie does as well or better than the best of the scientifically created human movies is the theoretical presentation of the development of a life form that is usually just handled with stereotypical laziness or perhaps better described as underdeveloped primitiveness. Writer Seth Owens and director Luke Scott both put extensive and artful portrayal of artificial life persona into the big screen with both creepy and emotive effectiveness. While Splice (2009) also offered a carefully appealing psychological developmental process of human created life, Morgan offers up an additional covert agenda (with some resemblance to Alien (1979)) as well as an even closer look and vibrant and compelling relational interactions between and among the characters in the movie. Morgan spends more time allowing the audience to experience and absorb and evaluate for ourselves Morgan's existence and its meaning.Albeit, a number of audience members will likely miss the nuances of this movie and reasonably compare it to Event Horizon (2009) or Cube (2009) due to its cynical nature and that's all. Yet a closer experience of Morgan can also reveal even deeper resonating and at the same time frustrating emotions if one compares Morgan to an assassin movie like Hannah (2011) or La Femme Nikita (1990) of which there are similar parallels in character development and the ethical underpinnings as well as conspiracy theories that tie these movies together.Unlike Kurt Russell's sci fi character in Soldier (1998), Morgan presents a rather more complex and more opaque presentation than even Roy Batty's character in Blade Runner (1982). Overall, Morgan is a good addition as well as sometimes an apparent improvement on the vast majority of artificial intelligence movies to date, ranking with the best of them including the more forward looking Ex Machina (2015)(which I found an actress being too human trying to be an artificial life form instead of the other way around)), Transcendence (2014), Lucy (2014), Automata (2014), EVA (2011), and my favorite The Machine (2013).",Morgan
25,Reno-Rangan,"Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject!",5,14 December 2016,"A nicely made sci-fi-thriller, but the entire storyline was built on a very familiar plot. You can find it similarities with 'Splice', 'Uncanny' and 'Ex Machina', but I think overall not a bad attempt. I did not get impressed, so do most of the people who saw those films, especially the end scene. Though it is entertaining, particularly when it turns into an action mode.The corporate that invested in a research sends an investigator named Lee after the project was met with a small accident. During an interview, the chaos unleashes and the lab started to fall apart. The survivours does not know who to trust, but decides to save their subject. What really follows after that will be totally unexpected and another twist before the final credits.Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject. That's what all the similar topic films reveal. Then what's the point of doing such test, being doctor, studied psychology. For a film plot, they wanted to use the human sentiments and errors. Otherwise, science does not really deal like what was shown in this film.From a new director, with the decent actors, particularly Kate Mara's best in an action avatar. I liked the Anya in the film 'The Witch' and this is another good performance by her in the title role. Felt like it is a short film, because the pace was so good, even though the story was a one-liner. Minimal cast film and takes place in a remote place secret research lab.

26,Floated2,Serviceable thriller,7,26 November 2017,"Morgan doesn't offer much of anything new and from the plot synopsis, reminded much of Ex-Machina (which is a much better film). Morgan has a typical and predictable story line plot and overall not too much suspense or thrills. We understand within the film right from the beginning that ""Morgan"" would cause havoc and start causing problems potentially killing others. A clever but obvious twist from the ending was helped to save the film but it did not do much. Overall, Morgan is quite decent but could have been much better, as it is somewhat of a mess. The performance of Morgan played by Anya Taylor-Joy was good, though some issues regarding Kate Mara's performance (though some claim it was intended). We are not surprised as to why this film flopped and may be forgotten years from now.As a rewatch 11 08 21' opinions changed upon a second viewing of this film. Although the film is still predictable and so is the twist, it is very much watchable and does provide solid action and quality suspense. The runtime is short enough that it doesn't drag on.

27,eddie_baggins,A poor man's Ex Machina,2,7 May 2017,"It mustn't be easy being the offspring of a legendary filmmaker if you yourself are looking to carve out a successful career behind camera.No matter what you do to start off with, its inevitable that you're beginning works will be referenced against the works of your parent.In consideration of this, it's hard to not judge budding filmmaker Luke Scott here on debut against the works of his father Ridley and in doing so the young upstart doesn't even come close to the best of Scott's many years of solid works and at the end of the day, Luke's Morgan feels like a cheap and nasty version of a much better film in the form of Alex Garland's Ex_Machina.Sharing many similarities to 2015's sci-fi hit in the way in which it deals with artificial/manufactured intelligence and the way in which we study/deal with it, Morgan has some very cool ideas but its uneasy mix of sci-fi and horror elements combine to create a genuinely unengaging experience that fails in almost all aspects.Scott doesn't at present possess his father's talent for visual pizazz and thrilling handling of action whilst the many more conversational moments of Morgan (of which there are many) fail to properly get you in their grips, bar one particularly good Paul Giamatti cameo (when isn't this guy MVP of whatever his in?). The way also in which we are introduced to Morgan (an artificially created being) and the team tasked with handling her development also leaves much to be desired despite some solid attempts by the recognisable cast.Led by Kate Mara as emotionally void higher up employee Lee Weathers, Morgan also introduces us to Rose Leslie's loving carer Dr. Amy Menser and Anya Taylor-Joy's titular mysterious creation but unlike say Ex_Machina's wholly engaging cast of characters and scenes together, Morgan never bothers to make us care about the group were joined up with, even if at times Scott try's to manipulate our emotions in certain ways.It's arguable that there's a good story to be told within Morgan but there's also solid arguments to be made that this type of story has been told before and told a lot better and while it's great to know the Scott name is entering into its next generation, Luke certainly has a long way to go before we can start getting excited about that fact.1 injured deer out of 5",Morgan

It takes place in one area and has a small cast.The big difference between those small below budget movies and Morgan is that this movie is produced by Ridley Scott and directed Luke Scott, a name I've never herd before, yet rings a loud bell if you get my drift. So obviously, Scott's one location is going to look far more elaborate than other one location shoots and have a small cast made of some very familiar faces.It has a very Horror film style to it, with a cabin in the woods and taking more of a pre psycho style to the Horror. In this Sci-fi Drama, Morgan is a Frankenstein-like monster, a human created in a lab by a group of mad scientist, but unlike Frankenstein's Monster, Morgan is a little more aware of her small group of villager's feelings on her and is design to be more capable to deal with it, making everyone's fears on Morgan come true.Kate Mara was really hot in this movie. It's definitely a personal appeal for me as I watch. Though she is part of an ensemble cast she takes the center of attention like I've never seen before in a movie, and despite the strange haircut, she's very sexy as a cold hearted pencil pusher for a huge corporation. Plus, the movie did not have enough of my preferred eye candy, Michelle Yeoh, who plays the main scientist that put Morgan together.Overall, Morgan turn out to be such a complete film filled with so much goodness.

31,jtindahouse,The story structure is a real mess,5,18 August 2017,"Here's the problem with 'Morgan' as a film, there are two very distinct halves to the film and yet neither of them really works. The film starts off very slowly, the first 30 minutes are an absolute grind and an arduous one as that. In fact I can imagine a lot of people giving up on the film in the early stages because they thought they were in for some action and weren't getting it. At this stage I thought the film's sole purpose was to be a thought-provoking piece. Then the film takes a very abrupt turn around the halfway point and suddenly becomes a non-stop, violence-filled rampage.So let's take a look at why neither half works. The first half doesn't work for multiple reasons. One, it's been done before. The concept of Artificial Intelligence in films has been explored often and almost always the film makers like to ask the question about whether or not they should be treated as real people with the same rights and privileges. Secondly, the pacing is simply far too slow. I understand they were saving up for the second half, but the problem with that is that by that stage the audience likely no longer cares - if they haven't left the cinema already that is.So the why doesn't the second half work? Firstly, it makes no sense. We have to believe that a group of very intelligent people make some incredibly dumb decisions. From the moment Paul Giamatti's character enters the film (although his acting is admittedly terrific) all sense of logic and believability fly completely out the door. Secondly, the concept of non-stop violence isn't really enough any more. There has to be some intelligence behind it. As it turns out with the twist near the end there actually was a level of intelligence behind it all. The problem is that again the audience didn't know that fact as they were seeing it happen.There are some entertaining moments in the mix and the acting from almost the whole cast is of a pretty high standard. The twist is also clever enough and adds some brownie points. But all added together there's a lot more wrong with this film than there is right.",Morgan

Oh yeah, he is also the son of Ridley. The story involves a group of scientists/doctors that are trying to gene splice a new type of human. Michelle is the doctor in charge and the experiments are conducted in a secure, underground bunker. The doctors have had several failures before Anya/Morgan seems to be the ultimate winner. Anya has developed mentally and physically way beyond her physical age of 5-she looks like a teenager. The only problem is Anya seems to be having anger issues and when she gets mad, someone or some animal usually gets hurt-that is why she is confined to the underground bunker. After the latest temper fit-she tore out a doctor's eye-corporate headquarters sends Kate, their top risk management consultant, to figure out what should be done and then do it-you know, give Anya a sucker or terminate her. Guess which one Kate chooses? Paul is an evaluation expert that is also sent in to check up on Anya and he seems to agree with Kate. Of course, Anya does not agree with their assessment and makes a break for freedom. That is when the fun begins. There are some good martial arts fight scenes-Anya can go toe to toe with any adult at the compound-and there is a nice plot twist at the end of the movie that I did not see coming.

This engineered human is in the form of a teenage girl and as the research team has assesses her, they have grown emotionally attached, thus keeping emotions detached for a proper assessment poses a challenge, surprisingly as this one has an erratic tendency for violent outbursts. Will everyone involved be able to keep feelings at bay to make an unbiased decision? This is a well-produced and fairly well-acted film with doses of some no-nonsense violence. There is a decent twist at the end telegraphed by some clever cinematography earlier on or if you have seen many films with this story, it may not be shocking.

She talks to the scientists there who have been living at this camp for years. Lee talks to the victim of the attack who somehow survived, but she's drugged. However, she has quickly gets a sense of who Lee really is, and what she's there to do.Then Lee and we meet Morgan. Morgan is a hybrid human/AI. She's a few years old but looks like a teenager and is also developing superior mental abilities. Basically, the entire team loves her and makes excuses for the attack. In flashbacks we see how Morgan enjoyed walking in the woods and the river. One important event was when she ran into a starving and injured deer and she decided to end its misery.The next day the psychologist arrives who will evaluate Morgan's state of mind. To him she might as well be a microwave, no different than other AI. The doctor pushes Morgan until she flips out and chews his neck off. Now the crew under Lee's supervision as well as the researcher in charge decide to put Morgan to sleep. Of course others have different plans and Morgans escapes and goes again into berserk mode.

I was, like...careless.""Man has always been fascinated by artificial intelligence. Either an attempt is made to create a properly functioning living being, by making use of human remains, such as in ""Frankenstein"". In most cases a high-tech design containing artificial intelligence is made, as in ""Ex Machina"" or ""Uncanny"". In ""Closer to God"", the cloning of a human being is the central subject. Or as in ""Splice"", you'll see the manipulation of DNA from different organisms which leads to a reasonable bizarre looking being. Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) is the result of synthetic DNA and applying nanotechnology on the neural network of an organism. It's a rapidly developing human-like creature, whose intelligence and physical appearance grows exponentially. As Dr. Ziegler (Toby Jones) enthusiastically said : ""A hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision-making and sophisticated emotional responses"".But as always, deficiencies can be found in this seemingly perfect creation. As in all the above-mentioned similar stories, those who carried out the task of creator of human life (in religious circles the expression divine intervention would be used rapidly), will become victims of their own creation. That's something Dr. Grieff Kathy (Jennifer Jason ""The hateful Eight"" Leigh) experienced first-hand. A talk session with Morgan, who flew into an abusive rage, ends with a pierced eye. But like all other scientists who try to create artificial life, an emotional bond is being formed between the creator and the creature which leads to a rather protective attitude from the scientists. We see the same here as Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) is summoned to assess the situation and to take the decision whether or not to proceed with the Morgan project. This could mean the termination of Morgan's existence.The film was directed by Luke Scott, son of my ""all time favorite"" director Ridley Scott. Unmistakable he inherited the qualities as a director from his father. Even though the story isn't exactly groundbreaking, Luke Scott manages to create some suspense. Of course, the acting of Anya Taylor Joy and Kate Mara also played an important role. Morgan is kind of creepy, despite her human appearance, with her pale white face and jet-black piercing eyes. The same look as in ""The VVitch"". But it is mainly her attitude and composure that impresses. A shrewd and thought out look. And yet, Morgan can transform any moment into a raging fury, harboring a deadly aggression. Lee Weathers has that same calmness and sobriety with which she approaches the facts. Two equal personalities ending up in a fierce confrontation.The given situation with Morgan behind armored glass, was a perfect opportunity to increase the tension between Morgan, Lee Weathers and those who created her. Immediately it made me think of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". The only thing that annoyed me the most, was the intervention of Dr. Alan Shapiro (Paul Giamatti). An unstable, artificial experiment attacks a staff-member in an aggressive manner, yet this tactless, blasé behaving psychiatrist can interview it without any protection. When this ignoramus starts to provoke Morgan in a challenging way, the outcome is really predictable. What else did this charlatan expect to happen? A miraculous personality change? Although this scene conveys an overall stupidity, it's a very intense moment. It's, as it were, a tilting moment in the film. Giamatti plays his part in a brilliant way. This actor knows how to pick his roles. Mostly it isn't a decisive leading part, but each character Giamatti chooses, plays a crucial role in the course of the film. The chauffeur Ralph in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is another example.But despite the strong performances and intriguing subject, this felt like a mediocre film to me. Probably because I could guess already in advance which way it was going. Even the crazy, violent denouement with a rampaging frenzy Morgan in the lead, couldn't change the ordinary feeling of mediocrity. A kind of ""light"" version of ""Ex Machina"".

39,Amari-Sali,A young semi-human being is seemingly glitching and with that comes the need to analyze if she is a failed project or not.,7,3 September 2016,"Trigger Warning(s): Gun Violence | Blood | Flinch Worthy Violence | Depction of SuicideMain Storyline For around 5 years Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) has been alive. However, after witnessing a hurt deer something has changed, something has been triggered. To the point where, when forced into isolation, she attacks a woman named Kathy (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Leading to corporate sending Lee Weathers (Kate Mara) to check on things and do as she sees fit. Which, with Morgan being told far too much about her situation, leads to quite a bit of conflict.{Commentary} HighlightsThe fight scenes in the movie are absolutely brutal. Even without the majority having broken bones or anything like that, there is something about the intensity in Taylor-Joy's face, and the movements of her likely stunt double, which make every kick, punch, suffocation, or neck twist, just seem gruesome. And this is coming from someone who has seen a few violent movies.Alongside that praise, I must admit I enjoyed the character of Dr. Alan Shapiro (Paul Giamatti), in the small role he has. If only because this movie strongly reminds me of Ex-Machina but with more people fooled by the subject. However, Giamatti, with the young Taylor-Joy pulls this feeling out of you. It is established that, despite no combat training, Morgan is dangerous. However, every caretaker she has, and how she reacts to Dr. Shapiro, leads you to almost being in this state of not believing this girl knows what she is doing. But as he pushes her, almost like a principal with a student, trying to forcefully get to the bottom of some prank, you begin to question things. You question if Morgan, who we are told is so smart, and perhaps is learning about emotions, has learned to manipulate everyone? Or, at the very least, knows how to take advantage of them through affectionate terms like, mother, father, and friend. But then Dr. Shapiro smacks those rose colored glasses off of everyone. To the point that, if you were ever in trouble in school in which the principal and your parents got involved, you may wanna prep for a flashback.Low PointsOne of the main problems with Morgan is everyone seems so desperate to get you to like the child, or at least feel for her, that it is counterproductive. For, while we get to see her grow up and learn she is going through some weird form of puberty, at the same time you have a violent image of her stabbing someone in the eye. Then, on top of that, someone thought it would be cute to make it so everyone portrays it as a child-like mistake. Because, you know, we don't have nutcases on the news every month shooting and stabbing people because life isn't how they want. Yeah, that is the best way to make the audience fall for someone. Especially with actors who seemingly struggle to get you to see things from their point of view.Though, with so little time spent on developing anyone but Morgan, they never had a chance. Lee walks in as a foreigner in this little community and everyone tries to be friendly but it isn't like they are having multiple days of dinner and get to know you chat. The movie itself is only about 2-3 days and in that time the only interesting thing that happens, non-Morgan related, is when this character named Skip (Boy Holbrook) kisses Lee and makes you wonder if he may be the key to peeling the layers of this very calculated character. But, alas, while we do learn a bit about Lee, it is the type of information which makes you roll your eyes for even before the reveal it becomes obvious what she is. After all, why would they send one single person, well two if you could Dr. Shapiro, to investigate a dangerous man-made entity which is not only potentially violent, in an unpredictable way, but has the intelligence to possibly cause a lot of damage to the company? Both in terms of human resources and public relations. Much less, why would that person, meaning Lee, have a gun, seemingly have combat training, and figure out a way to break out of the cell that the genius, Morgan supposedly is, couldn't think of?On The FenceI must admit I admire the attempts, even if they weren't as developed as I would have honestly liked, to make it seem Morgan had some type of relationship with some of her caretakers beyond them being in awe of her. The relationship with Dr. Amy (Rose Leslie) in particular I thought was cute for with Amy not being seen as Morgan's mother, and it not being clear what age Morgan might be, I was curious as to whether Amy saw Morgan as either a friend or something more. Especially with the scene in the woods and the scene the day before Morgan was to be psychologically evaluated by Dr. Shapiro.Overall Rating: Home Viewing",Morgan
40,rgkarim,"More moral discussion than horror, Morgan fails to deliver suspense.",6,2 September 2016,"Picture it, flashing lights, eerie music and images of an artificial life being created on a giant screen. Paints the idea of a science fiction horror movie right? Yeah that's what I thought when I saw the trailer for Morgan. However, Hollywood is known for fooling us with their editing and therefore I return to my viewing spot once more. Let's get startedLIKES  A true science fiction plot  Decent acting  Twist in the endTo quote a friend, ""We seldom get a true science fiction movie that isn't drowned out by CGI action scenes and grotesque monsters."" Fortunately, Morgan defies that trend and dives deep into the core of the genre, focusing on the scientific process in all its details. In a script laden with scientific jargon, one will return to a college biology course sprinkled with a genetics topping. But the natural science pales to Morgan's primary focus of the ethics involved with creating life and trying to control it. Much of the film revolves around the small band of scientists arguing about Morgan's role in life and what the future holds for their creation. It's another black and white debate between parties, with some slight character development thrown in to add some depth. As mentioned the film centers on scientists trying to rationalize the ethics of their creations. So it's probably important to have a good cast to bring the roles to life right? In my opinion, the team did okay, but it wasn't the most earth shattering performances to grace the screen. Kate Mara led the team playing a monotone role that while flat, held some mystery to it. While she certainly was able to look mean and perform stage combat, I wanted to see more of her character to round things out. Anya-Taylor Joy as Morgan certainly has the sociopathic role down and could easily play the next serial villain in a crime drama show. The other assembled casts did a smashing job on their part, both looking and playing the part of obsessive scientists to quite impressive levels. But perhaps the biggest like of the movie was the twist in the end. In terms of the plot, there is more than meets the eye to some of the characters and the mystery begins to unravel as things heat up. You'll have to get to the end of the film before the pieces fall together, but those with open eyes may pick up hints if they watch carefully. In addition, the movie actually gets a twist in genre at the end, turning into a part action movie with surprisingly violent stunts. While certainly cheesy this change of pace makes for a semi-exciting climax that relieves the movie of its drab pace. DISLIKES:  Boring, slow pace  Not a horror movie or suspenseful  Graphic Torture Morgan's message about the mistakes made when playing God are beaten over the head, but the package it's delivered in was so dull at times. Sure scientific minds may get caught up in the jargon and scientific ideas, but the team focused too much on the scholastic and not enough on the entertainment. Surely the mystery element could make up for it, but I found little mystery in this movie other than when Morgan would go nuts, what would happen to her, and of course the twist I don't want to ruin. If you're into the moral dilemmas and high grade vocabulary this won't bother you, but you might want to bring a pillow in case science wasn't your cup of tea. When the monotonous discussion eventually stops and the system begins to fail, I thought the suspense would pour in. Wrong again. Despite the dark hallways painted in red, there wasn't much outside of Morgan's creepy close ups that one would find unsettling. I apologize for sounding like a broken record, but this movie lacks in thrills or suspense until the final fifteen to twenty minutes. When it finally rears its head, the suspense comes in the form graphic torture, that involves brutal mauling, mindless shooting, and a little kung fu to sweeten the wet meat deal. I'll admit some of these moments are fitting, however it also felt hastily wrapped up into an anticlimactic ending (like the ending to American Horror Story Season 4). The VERDICTMorgan held a lot of potential, but this reviewer felt much of it was lost in the direction it took. While I appreciate the attempts at being a true science fiction movie and preaching the importance of morals in discovery, it certainly failed to deliver the promised thrills. Such a shame considering they had a decent cast and setting to bring those horrors to life, but you can't hit a home run all the time right? I can't recommend this film for the theater, but you might give this one a shot at home when it hits Redbox in a few months.

It would be nice if a movie about ""science gone wrong"" actually had the scientists be scientists, rather than bumbling buffoons meddling with things they do not understand.Well, sadly, Morgan is not that movie. The scientists here all get overly attached to their work, leading to predictable mayhem and destruction.Overall, Morgan is not a bad film. Dumb scientists apart, it is a reasonable thriller that, although utterly predictable, entertains for the most part.Whilst we all crave a movie that surprises us and makes us mutter ""Didn't see that coming!"", it is sometimes nice to watch a movie and know what is to come well in advance of the characters in the story.Morgan is that latter type of film. Even the ""twist"" at the end is utterly predictable and, if I'm honest, rather ham-fistedly telegraphed at points earlier on in the movie. That doesn't mean the film is bad, except in its lack of originality. It is just rather formulaic.The cast do their best. I doubt any of them were challenged by their ""overly attached ex-girlfriend"" characterisations and the movie builds quite nicely over its run time. A couple of the cast, like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Brian Cox, are woefully under-utilised and only Paul Giamatti really gets to go nuts in his brief cameo.Overall, I found it more engaging than Ex-Machina, which it is often compared to, and less preachy. What it does well, is make you change your opinion of the main character, Morgan herself, several times during the film. You feel by turns, pity, then fear, of the character and this cycle happens more than once.However, overall, it isn't anything special or worth going out of your way for and finds its best moments in the first half of the film.SUMMARY: Rejoice as dumb scientists return! Science bad, violence good. Science will kill us all etc etc. Woefully obvious twist ending. Okay, but nothing you'll discuss around the water-cooler the following day.",Morgan
42,vengeance20,Seemed promising but failed at the last minute,5,3 September 2016,"From the same gloomy, dull, isolated setting which was the premise of 2015's Ex_Machina, comes Morgan. A film with a similar premise only with a dose of horror & a few slight differences added in.Morgan is about young girl or ""android"" should I say who has been created as part of an experiment in an underground facility. But something goes wrong & she or ""it"" starts viciously attacking people out of the blue in very gruesome ways for F*ck all reason pretty much.The story was alright when it started (pardon the pun). But when it came to the ending part it sort of went down hill a bit & you eventually began to find the predictable ending quite shite & not what you thought, though it got me, I wasn't impressed, I was actually a bit disappointed by the ending to be honest.It could've been better as a straight forward film without the twist as it had at least 3 plot holes in it as far as I saw.Overall a 5/10 is pretty much fitting for this film as I would've gave it a higher rating of 7, 8 or even 9 at the VERY max had it been any better without the pathetic twist that was clearly unneeded & a cliché in on itself.",Morgan
43,bkrauser-81-311064,Passable But Nothing New,7,10 September 2016,"It has been near thirty-five years since director Ridley Scott blew people's minds with Blade Runner (1982). Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, the story of intrepid ""Replicant"" hunter Rick Deckard caught the imaginations of film fans for decades; seamlessly blending deep philosophical themes into a tech noir, sci-fi aesthetic that felt both out of time and completely 80's. Now in 2016, Scott's son director Luke Scott seems to want to create a variant of the same idea. A film that once again delves into what it means to be human, while entertaining its audience through the latest popular sci-fi milieu: sustainable futurism.Similar films in themes and aesthetic like Ex Machina (2015) and Under the Skin (2013) merely stumble a bit on wanting slasher clichés. Morgan on the other hand practically impales itself on cheap, low-level pulp, bad characterization and scattershot story progression like a witchcraft scapegoat on a Judas Cradle. It tries so hard to be above it all, and any film fan can admire its ambition. Yet when the plot skips second gear and goes right to third, you can't help but feel you're watching an homage to Hollow Man (2000) bombast instead of Blade Runner subtlety.Morgan (Taylor-Joy) isn't so much a she but an ""it"". A genetically modified humanoid created by a team of closely knit scientists working for a seemingly omnipresent company. After a very violent outburst threatens the future of the five-year Morgan Program, the company brings in a corporate risk-management consultant to evaluate whether or not to terminate the project.It's quite a challenge to try to make the case for or against Morgan when the film's trailer tries so hard to keep the film's inner workings obscure. Walking in, audience members might find themselves looking forward to anything from a modern vampire blood-bath to an understated Frankenstein-type horror film. Without ruining too much, it's possible the film can be considered both and neither. It's essentially two films rolled up into a double-helix and spliced, guaranteeing no one will be happy with the result.As our business-like heroine, risk-manager Lee Weathers (Mara) is varying degrees of believable depending on the scene. Juicy moments between her and researchers Dr. Ziegler (Jones) and Brenner (Yare) percolate with layers of power struggle, while moments with Boyd Holbrook's nutritionist Skip (because aren't they all called Skip) are guardedly fun. Yet when put up against Taylor-Joy's Morgan, Mara and the screenplay let on a lot more than they really need to.Anya Taylor-Joy as the callow and calculated Morgan does alright though her Jekyl feels far more effective than her Hyde. Despite grey skin, carefully syncopated speech and a hoodie out of Eminem's 8 Mile (2002), you do feel for Morgan, who is essentially a five- year-old with the addled brain of a confused teenager. Yet seemingly with the flick of a switch or the pull of a trigger, Morgan goes full Commando (1985) with the nonplussed expressions of an actor playing a psychopath. This is as opposed to either fully committing to the role or making the more appropriate choice of acting like a caged animal in flight or fight mode.Yet for every major performance that underwhelms and feels patently false (Rose Leslie you are hereby on notice), there are a few that really shine. Paul Giamatti appears for a brief spill. He plays a patently prickly psychologist who despite the character's boorishness creates one of the best interrogation scenes so far this year. Michelle Yeoh as the project's head researcher does exactly what she needs to while one-day shoot players Jennifer Jason Leigh and Brian Cox maximize their effectiveness.Morgan attempts to be a moody psychological thriller, a philosophical think-piece and a conspiratorial cautionary tale but uses all the wrong tools to accomplish its goal. It's blunt when it should be contemplative and frenetic when it should be calm. It calls attention to itself and angrily glares at you like a huffy six-year-old who just found out they're not getting dessert. The next time a film comes out that tries to pose questions about the ethics and nature of humanity, make sure to check for characters that resemble humans.",Morgan
44,Richie-67-485852,More Morgan,7,2 March 2018,"I like sci-fi for its ability to get us to thinking as we are being entertained. This movie does that pretty well. The premise of a new life form is always a good story to tell and if you add mystery, intrigue and drama you get this movie. My only criticism is that it was too short and under-developed but nothing a sequel couldn't cure if handled properly. There are twists along the way which keep you glued to the screen and one wonders about the full premises of this story if it was truly unleashed. the movie goes there too! Here's to....",Morgan

46,phanthinga,a good dark sci-fi horror movie,8,18 January 2017,"So Morgan directed by Luke Scott is a sci-fi horror movie with the plot involving a team of scientist tried to raise a girl made from a lab that go horribly wrong .Basic concept that has been made million time before but this time it actually tried to tell a different story.Much like his dad Sir Riddley Scott the man who brought us many great sci-fi movie like Blade Runner,Alien and Prometheus he really know how to shoot a movie with great cinematography and beautiful isolation location.The acting in this movie is great,everybody is giving their best work throughout the movie with two spot on performance by Kate Mara and Anya Taylor-Joy play the main character Morgan who keep proving herself is one of the best young actress working day.In the end this is a damn fine sci-fi horror movie with many intense scene,good action movie set pieces and a very shocking third part which make me feel very disturbed.If you a hardcore sci-fi movie fan definitely check this movie out",Morgan
47,RforFilm,Morgan is a bad cliff notes version of Ex Machina and Splice.,3,5 September 2016,"One sub genre of science fiction we don't see enough of is the mad scientist-story. This is where people attempt to play God and bring something into the world that nature had never intended to. While sometimes the experiments are done with dark intentions, many of the stories feature such scientists as naïve and only trying to improve life. The ones with the beakers and electricity often get lost within their goal and loose their morals in favor of success. The prime example of this has to be Frankenstein. Mary Shelly's novel of a man trying to give life to a body has captivated and spooked people for decades. So where are the rest of these mad scientist stories?The majority of them have been found in film format with other examples including The Fly, Re- Animator, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and the one that pushed it the furthest, The Human Centipede. Today's film seems to be a combination of two movies, Ex Machina and Splice. This movie also happens to be directed by Luke Scott, son of the acclaimed Ridley Scott. Now if his father can change science fiction with Alien, can the son do so again with Morgan?Lee Weathers (played by Kate Mara) is a risk assessment specialist who is sent to Northern Ireland to examine a company's top-secret project about a child that has been created by artificial DNA inserted into a test tube egg. It may be only five years old, but Morgan (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) is already a young woman who is intelligent and seems human enough that her behavior specialist treats her as such. Morgan recently has a tantrum that caused her to lash out a one of the scientists. As such, she lost her privilege to go outside and is the reason why Lee is there; to determine if she is worth keeping alive.Lee immediately senses that Morgan might be too dangerous and unpredictable to keep going with. Despite the pleas of other scientists that see Morgan as a daughter, Lee only sees her as an inferior company product that needs to be stopped. Things reach a breaking point when a psychologist (played by Paul Giamatti) pushes her feelings enough to murder him and to try and make an escape. It becomes a cat and mouse chase when Lee follows Morgan into the woods to eliminate her.You can tell that Luke Scott had a lot of influence from his father as there are a lot of elements of Alien towards the end. I'll say that Morgan is a nice looking movie, but not only is it telling stories we've seen before, but creates more problems. Ex Machina is one of the best artificial intelligent movies I've seen in a while, but this is similar, but without the intelligent ideas nor the script to pull it off. I'll say that the transition from a scientist movie to a horror movie has to be one of the sloppiest transitions I've seen in a while.While a lot of critics seemed to have enjoyed the performance of Kate Mara, I found it surprisingly stilted and plain. While the movie explains it in the story's twist (you can figure it out very early on), it came off as emotionless, as if the actress put herself on autopilot. An insurance seminar would have been more interesting then Kate Mara's performance. The movie happens to be pretty short, barley making in at an hour and a half. I'll bet that several pages of the script were torn out in favor of speeding up the action.I'll give this three bits of artificial DNA out of ten. Morgan simply doesn't offer anything new, nor tells it's own story in an entertaining way. If you want a good movie about tampering with human genetics, just watch Splice. Morgan is one word movie title I doubt I'll remember come next year. Stop this experiment.",Morgan
48,bankofmarquis,A swing and a miss,5,4 September 2016,"The advertisements MORGAN ended with the question ""What is Morgan""?After seeing this film, my answer is ""I don't care""!MORGAN is the story of what happens when man tries to create artificial life. Much like the superior EX MACHINA, it grapples with issues of whether Morgan is a person, or a thing and should man do this. Unfortunately, it grapples with these issues much like I grapple with getting the top off a jar of pickles - clumsily.Director Luke Scott (son of Ridley) assembles a strong cast that is, quite frankly, wasted. Kate Mara stars as ""Corporate Risk Management Consultant"" Lee Weathers who has come to assess the Morgan ""project"" at a remote research facility (are there any other kind?) - is mysterious and quiet, too much so in fact. I was immediately aware of the telegraphing of ""something's up with her"" from the get go. Mara (and/or the director) could have benefited from being more subtle with her character.The usually reliable Toby Jones plays one note as the lead Scientist on the project and the great Michelle Yeoh continues her screen comeback in mediocre films (see my review of MECHANIC RESURRECTION) as another scientist who is there to, I think, mumble the line ""We're not going to repeat the mistakes of Helsinki"" over and over again. Only Rose Leslie's behavioral psychologist gets to play some range, but her character, who is supposed to be an expert in her field, does some really dumb things.Add to that 2 actors who, I am assuming, got paid VERY WELL for being in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh follows up her Oscar- nominated turn in THE HATEFUL EIGHT with this role that she - quite literally - sleeps through for most of the film. Perhaps, she had a juicy scene left on the cutting room floor or perhaps she owed Luke's dad a favor, but this was a NOTHING role that, quite frankly, she brought nothing to.And then there is our old pal, Paul Giamatti. Mr. Giamatti can be a very fine, nuanced actor. He can also chew the scenery with the best of them - and chew scenery he does. He is in only one scene in this film (though the previews make him look like a major player) and I think director Scott kept saying to him ""Bigger...BIGGER!"" and bigger he went. To be honest, I was getting a little bored of this movie before Giamatti showed up, so, at least, he pumped some life and energy in this film.Finally, there is the performance of Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan. Taylor-Joy is being hailed as an ""up and coming"" actress for her performances in last springs THE VVITCH and this film. I saw them both and if your definition of ""up and coming actress"" is playing blank stares and not saying much, then she's your gal. I gotta see more from her before I declare her ""the next big thing"".Truly disappointed in this one. If you want to see a film grappling with the issues of man creating Artificial Life, then see EX MACHINA, if you want to see a brand new filmmaker taking a swing and a miss and wasting some good talent, see MORGAN.5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Morgan
49,PsychoBeard666,Hmmmmmmm,7,15 March 2021,"I remember not thinking much of this film the first time I saw it, but I've just watched it again and it was much better than I recalled.Maybe I've come to appreciate certain members of the cast a bit more, or maybe my expectations were very low?Either way I recommend it.",Morgan
50,jrarichards,"Adequate thriller, but far from original",6,6 February 2017,"Given the existence of two other moderately comparable films with titles consisting of a female first name (i.e. ""Lucy"" and ""Hanna"" - both of which I've reviewed), there seems little doubt what niche ""Morgan"" is aiming at. That begs a question as to whether this British-American piece from Ridley Scott's son Luke Scott is not afraid of the competition because it's confident of its own quality and merits, or whether it's simply too ignorant to care. Those are two quite different possibilities and in fact it's a fairly close call between them! Ultimately, I QUITE enjoyed ""Morgan"" (which is also a bit similar to ""Ex Machina""), but would have enjoyed it a great deal more had it cost me less to see it (yes, I'm afraid it's that kind of trade-off). There is some OK acting here, especially from Anya Taylor-Joy in the title role (when she is not ""in action"" at least), from Kate Mara as the person pitted against her, and - as ever - from Paul Giamatti. Michelle Yeoh has great screen presence without trying too hard, though Rose Leslie (of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Game of Thrones"" fame) takes no step forward of any kind here.I'm not normally cagey about giving away plot details, as I know a good film can stand that - hence the ever-present spoiler warning. But here it would be pointless to write much, as it would CERTAINLY ruin the film. This is therefore its own kind of warning about this piece being a bit content-free (and it also includes the occasional dialogue clanger like ""biological organism"" - though this is nowhere near as bad as in ""Lucy"", by the way). However, ""Morgan"" is reasonably atmospheric, reasonably well-located, and it does - at moments - achieve the intended mix of emotions that (if taken further and handled with a lighter touch) would have raised ""Morgan"" up several notches. For brief periods, our heroine (if such be Morgan herself) engenders tender feelings - not least sympathy for her predicament - from the viewer, but these periods are somewhat too brief, and the story overall slightly too predictable, to allow those feelings to flower as they otherwise might. 50% less ""action"" and 50% more of the aforementioned sensitivity, and we really might have been on to something, but as ever it's a question of pleasing different audiences. Personally speaking, I could have been more pleased than I was, but do not regard ""Morgan"" as entirely a waste of time. And - overall - it's probably not much worse than ""Hanna"", so take your pick...",Morgan
51,Seth_Rogue_One,Not anything groundbreaking but I enjoyed it,7,9 December 2016,"Sure it's not the most original piece of sci fi films of all time or anything but it's still a fairly well-made film.If I was to compare it with something I guess I would say something like 'Ex Machina (2015)' meets 'Splice (2009)' meets 'The Guest (2014)' kinda.The cast are good all over the map, Kate Mara shines the most IMO. Fans of Brian Cox and Paul Giamatti might want to know that they aren't in it all that much though.A bit flawed perhaps and might not offer as much food for thought as some other sci-fi's but overall a good way to spend 90 minutes.",Morgan

It's was at this point my wife turned to me and whispered ""do you think that agent character is one of them"" (meaning artificial) – so she saw that coming probably well ahead of when she should of. Of course, Kate Mara is another experimental, earlier prototype thingy and I'm sure you're not supposed to realise before the final showdown during Morgan's attempted escape.If you want to see a terminator style film, then see 'Terminator' If you want to see a film about artificial human enhancement, then see 'Lucy' If you want to see a film that discusses what it takes to be human, then see 'X-Machina'.I'd hesitate to recommend, as all these themes are done much better in the other respective films.",Morgan

54,Bababooe,"Garbage in = Garbage out! Ridley Scott? Luke Scott? We owe this mess to the legacy of Alien, an amateur cult film!",1,27 October 2017,"I saw the last 30 minutes of this movie on cable. I've read some of the reviews. So, I didn't see the beginning or the first 1 hour setup. But I saw the mess. Here's the problem folks: Garbage story, garbage cinematography and quick editing, garbage acting (bunch of nonsense stares), I cannot remember the music so it must have sucked too.Kate Mara, sorry to say it, she just sucks as an actress. I have not seen anything good from her. The fight scenes with her were ridiculous. OK, she turns out to be an engineered human or something. But when she fell off the balcony and kept moving, and the big reveal didn't happen yet, that's when we need to call this what it is, garbage story telling. PLEASE FIND SOME WRITERS WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE! She crashes the car, no problem, gets in another car and continues the chase. She fights Morgan, has her body slammed to the rocks, No problem. She gets impaled, and ends up drowning Morgan. By the way that was just a very stupid scene, boring and down right sleep inducing. Like what the hell is that? Then she kills the girl on the pier and the guy on the road. OK, now the BIG REVEAL. She's an artificial human soldier something. Then we get the scene with the corporate types discussing Kate Mara, that she's the perfect actress and that they will be able to follow this up with a few more movies, because Kate is great, and we can see that Kate is great, because they show Kate being great, not great acting, but just posing. Kate is not an actress. At best she is a fashion model.Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan was great if you think, blank stares are great. I've read reviews where people are raving about her being the next big actress. Maybe they are the same people who propped Jennifer Lawrence, I don't know. Well, from this performance I don't know how Anya can be anything more than a fashion model.Rose Leslie as Dr. Amy Menser at least showed some fear in her performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dr. Kathy Grieff was completely underused. I only saw the scenes with her eyepatch and her getting killed. Completely underused. Michelle Yeoh as Dr. Lui Cheng looked like a sad joke of acting and character. Paul Giamatti as Dr. Alan Shapiro, I didn't see his scenes, but from reading other reviews he was a psychiatrist who provoked Morgan. This tells me, it's unreal, not professional. And that the Producer/Director = Father/Son = Scott/Scott need to PLEASE FIND SOME WRITERS WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE! I can't comment on the other actors here, they might as well got some people off the street, at least they would have come up with better dialogue than what the writer Seth Owen came up with.So, what we have here is another pile of garbage. While watching it, it can be entertaining. But if you stop to think, the story is garbage. Better to watch the original, Frankenstein 1932. Do not see Bride of Frankenstein. Just the original, Frankenstein.This movie is another representation of our current society. It represents that if you build it they will come. Well, we've come and we've seen what you can produce. Nothing. Back in 1932 if you wanted to make a film, you better be sure to have a story or the studios will not even let you submit another story or even sweep the floors. What we have with Morgan is Mr. Ridley Scott, who hit a payload with the garbage film Alien, yes I said it. Alien is garbage. I am not fooled by nostalgia, or props, and I am not a part of cult. I don't believe in witches or extraterrestrials. Alien is an amateur film with crappy dialogue, characters, plot, scenes, cinematography. The acting is garbage all around. The best part of Alien is the props, and that's not even great. Frankenstein beats Alien on all fronts. Take a look at the prop in Frankenstein, in the form of Boris Karloff and tell me the prop alien in Alien is better. I don't think so. Scott got luck with Alien. Although Blade Runner is a much better movie, he got luck with that as well. At least Blade Runner had a story, and much superior actors. Please read my review of Alien for full evaluation of the garbage that it is.Until film makers start with GREAT and ORIGINAL Stories they will continue to produce films like this. What did we get with the over-hyped Force Awakens? Garbage, copy paste, superwoman! Force is in the name, but it's in the movie for a few seconds. Rogue One we get another superwoman in the middle of a bunch of tough warrior guys and she says, wait for it ""THE TIME TO FIGHT IS NOW!"" No S***!, why do you think we're all here assembled with all the artillery on our backs? It all starts with the writers.As Tiny Tim famously stated, God Help Us, Everyone!",Morgan
55,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,15 February 2019,"The stage curtains open ...A nice sci-fi thriller - kind of a ""Splice"" meets ""Terminator"" action film with some horror elements to it. Very engaging, very entertaining.When a genetic experiment named Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy) attacks one of the attending resident doctors at a hidden facility, a risk management expert, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara), is sent in to begin assessing the situation. Weathers is very calculating, professional and prompt with her job - not exactly making any friends while she is there. Morgan is technically only 5 years old, but has the vocabulary, body and reasoning ability of someone far older. And, as we see later on in the film, some rather excellent fighting skills as well. Morgan is pushed into a corner by another visiting doctor causing her to escape from the facility with Weathers hot on her trail.I had a lot of fun watching this movie. They give you a little twist at the end, but to be honest, I had already figured it out and wasn't really surprised with it. The acting was above average with convincing performances. The action sequences were awesome with some straight up fighting scenes, Jason Bourne style - and the cinematography was very well done. The story was good and the dialogue intelligent.

58,SquigglyCrunch,A Fantastically Paced Thriller,7,7 December 2016,"Morgan follows a risk consultant who goes to a lab where an artificial human has been made to assist in performing a psychiatric evaluation and decide whether or not the artificial life is dangerous or not. For starters the actors are all pretty good in their roles, specifically Kate Mara and Rose Leslie. Mara pulls off a reasonably flat but regardless intriguing character, and Leslie is a much more emotionally driven character, which she also manages to pull off pretty well. The pacing is fantastic in this movie. I didn't expect this at all, but the movie keeps itself going without skipping a beat. It never wastes time on too much development, but it develops the characters enough to get the audience relatively invested. It knows exactly how to handle itself and thus ceases to bore. When the action started it was often pretty fast-paced. While it wasn't great, the choreography was clearly better than most movies, it just could have done with less quick camera cuts. Otherwise the director clearly knew how to do action, and did it fairly well as a result. The end of the movie is exactly what I didn't expect. It's pretty intense, and it's completely unpredictable. It hints at it with subtle foreshadowing throughout the movie that you'd actually have to be looking for to find, and I really appreciated that. And yet the ending didn't just blatantly explain what happened. It treated the audience like a bunch of adults watching an R rated movie who can figure things out on their own. It has a level of respect for the audience, which was quite a nice break from a lot of other movies I've seen as of late. The movie does suffer in terms of writing from time to time. More often than not when characters curse it was like they were doing it for the sake of getting an R rating, not because it actually worked with the movie or flowed naturally into the dialogue. Characters would cuss in really calm tones of voice while something bad was about to happen/happening, and it just never really fit. It ended up being way too forced. Some other writing choices didn't work either, but most of them are easy to brush off or at least somewhat understandable.Overall Morgan is definitely a competently made movie. The pacing is excellent, the action is good, the acting is mostly good, but the writing suffers a little from time to time. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",Morgan
59,PyroSikTh,"Uncharacteristically Shallow, but Still an Entertaining Watch",7,3 September 2016,"Morgan is a genetically engineered human being, of sorts. It could be argued she is artificial intelligence as her development is augmented by a little nano cell that works it's way in and changes her genetic make-up. She is the third experiment, and the first to grow to full term, and as such her scientists and handlers have grown attached to her like parents. Unfortunately there's an incident that leaves one of her handlers without an eye, so the business that funds the research and development send in their ""Risk Management Consultant"" to evaluate the situation and ensure any necessary measures are enacted.The film spends a little time developing it's characters and the situation, but the second and third acts are almost indistinguishable as it cascades at break-neck speed to it's conclusion, giving the film a feeling of being rushed along. The development we do get is a little lacklustre as well, maybe in large part due to not being given enough time. Once everything kicks off, it becomes a display of smart people being stupid, meaningless deaths, and a cat and mouse chase between Lee and Morgan. There's no deeper subtext or message here either, which makes this low-key sci-fi feel a bit empty. All the ingredients are there for a deep and engaging commentary on artificial intelligence or corporate interference or familial relationships, but all of these things are just lightly touched upon and never developed.Despite this, what it does touch upon does enough to make you empathise with the scientists, particularly Amy, the behaviourist, and Dr. Ziegler, who have grown most attached to their subject. There's also mention of romantic relationships developing between doctors Darren and Brenda Finch, and them considering Morgan their child, although Darren is the only one of the two who really shows much of an attachment at all. In a way, all the stupid decisions of these scientists could be explained as being blinded by love for their creation. No-one wants to harm their children, and being cruel to be kind is tough, but this doesn't really excuse the lack of common sense displayed.The film's biggest sin was showing far too much in the trailers. Almost all the development is succinctly summarised in those two minutes, and most of the action is spoiled as well. For instance, Morgan goes into the house and says she has to say goodbye to Mother, referring to Dr. Cheng, but we already know the outcome of that from the trailer. Similarly, Lee and Morgan are chasing each other in cars down a country lane and bashing into each other, but we already saw Lee's Mercedes crash into a tree in the trailer, so again we already know the result of that conflict. I don't want to start avoiding trailers for movies, because I still think they're the best judge of a movie's potential, and I tend to treat them with a grain of salt anyway due to how they can be misrepresented, but Morgan makes me rethink that stance.That said, there are still a number of surprises in store, not least the big twist at the end. Yes, there's a twist at the end that encourages you to rethink the whole ninety minutes previously. Unfortunately it ultimately falls flat. First and foremost, it's not exactly a hidden twist. It's not spelled out throughout the movie, but what subtle hints we did get were enough to put the puzzle pieces together. I pegged it somewhere around the second act. Secondly, it just leaves the ending open to more questions while ignoring that this might be a problem. 'Here's a twist, Oh yeah! Wow! Credits...Wait, how does that work exactly?' I don't want to spoil it, but you'll know what I mean when you see it for yourself.Acting is actually pretty great though. The obvious star of the movie is Anya Taylor-Joy who manages to balance the emotional innocence of Morgan with her somewhat artificial nature without over-doing one or the other. She's obviously not human, even when exhibiting human emotions, but she doesn't appear to force it or look awkward doing it either. Kate Mara is quite good as the cold and somewhat emotionless Risk Management Consultant, Lee. But for me, it was Toby Jones as Dr. Ziegler and Rose Leslie as Amy who really shone and acted as great supports for Anya. It's the acting performances of Jones and Leslie that gives these characters so much development and eeks sympathy from the audience. Brian Cox, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the cast all do really well as well, but aren't really given much opportunity to dig into their characters and show us who they are. Cox and Giamatti in particular are just glorified cameos.Don't get me wrong, you could do worse than Morgan when picking a movie to watch, and I am definitely glad I watched it. It's teeming with potential that is just never fully realised. On it's own terms, as a tight thriller of a genetically engineered human seeing red, it is quite entertaining, and it's lack of depth allows the audience to just sit back and enjoy the ride. I enjoyed it, but it's far from anything special. I give it a good 7/10.",Morgan

Having similarities to ""Splice"" and, to an extent, ""Lucy,"" Morgan is (more or less) a test tube baby without a father or mother. She is literally made in the laboratory.However, as in most movies of this genre, things go awry and a corporate assessor is sent to determine whether or not Morgan is worth saving, or if everything needs to be shelved. I believe her decision should have been an easy one given Morgan's outbursts of aggression.There are many named actors in this movie: the divine Rose Leslie (of ""Game of Thrones"" fame), Paul Giamatti, Michelle Yeoh, Toby Jones, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Kate Mara, yet the movie comes across as robotic as its main character. All of the characters are as stiff as cardboard, and if you'll pay close attention, you should be able to figure where all this is headed long before the end credits.Rated ""R"" for violence and language.

63,Ramascreen,"If you liked ""Cube"" or ""Event Horizon,"" you'll like MORGAN",7,31 August 2016,"The film MORGAN is one that you'd file under decent attempt. Directed by Ridley's son, Luke Scott, you wonder if the apple doesn't fall far from the tree or the talent gets passed down trough genes, well, don't expect MORGAN to be on the same level as Ridley's ""Alien,"" that's for sure, but again, a decent attempt is what it is, the closest to a compliment I can give the film at this point.Kate Mara plays a corporate risk management officer, a troubleshooter, and she's sent to a top secret location to investigate and evaluate a recent accident, she's supposed to be there to find out what went wrong and judge the asset in terms of the overall profit. At this top secret location, scientists have successfully created what is perceived to be the perfect human (Anya Taylor-Joy) but turns out, she comes with her own set of unpredictable threats.What I can appreciate about MORGAN is that it takes familiar concepts from the world of science fiction and makes it its own. Creating life out of nothing or creating a life that's flawless has always been a fascination for ages. The film has its own way of addressing that. It's not perfect but the build up, the intensity, and the way things escalate as soon as situations go sideways, they're all well-paced and shot quite nicely. Definitely the one that stands out the most is young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, she already impressed me in ""The Witch"" earlier this year, and so her cold, calculating, fearsome performance in MORGAN only solidifies her reputation as the latest incredible force to be reckoned with. Better watch out for that one, she's going to go places. With its ensemble cast and its emphasis on keeping you guessing till the very end while wowing you with fight sequences and a big reveal, MORGAN is just the right dose of horror/sci-fi/thriller for us fans of such films as 1997's ""Cube"" or ""Event Horizon"" -- Rama's Screen --",Morgan
64,Rendanlovell,Conventional and boring.,4,16 September 2016,"As I watched 'Morgan' something became fairly obvious to me. This movie wanted to be 'Ex Machina' really bad. It's set in a remote location with a small cast. All of which are attempting to study a new form of human. Unlike 'Ex Machina' this film doesn't have any social or political commentary. Instead, this film has a twist ending that anyone could see coming from a mile away. Mainly, the film is about a young girl named Morgan that is a kind of superhuman. She has muddled powers and ages far more rapidly than any other human being. But, after an accident, a corporate consultant comes in to determine if the project can continue. The plot picks up as Kate Mara, the consultant, comes into the compound. She meets the workers and learns more about the situation. The one thing that worked really well for me was Kate Mara. Her performance was spot on for the character that she played. She may not have been the most involving protagonist, but what was odd is that she was meant to be that way.She was meant to play this odd, stone cold person and she did a great job. Other than her there were only one or two other good performances. Boyd Holbrook was the only other actor in the film that was great. Unfortunately, his character, Skip, doesn't get the screen that he deserved. Yet, he made the most of the time that he got.The only other thing that I can say impressed me was the camera work. Most of the interior shots were more or less close ups and that got a bit tiresome but everything else looked fantastic. The outdoor shots, the flashbacks, almost everything looked excellent. It was shot and colored to help you get more into the scene. And, even better, the camera was used a few times to give neat foreshadowing. Which was subtly used to help allude to things to come. All of that worked very well. Where this film falls apart is basically everywhere else. The story especially suffers. This mainly stems from the lack of compelling main characters. The film tries very hard to create sympathy for both the humans and the super girl. But it doesn't let you learn much about them or them motivations.Instead, they act completely irrationally for the entirety of the film. Like, this super girl stabbed a ladies eye out and murdered another guy and the scientists still try to protect her. I mean, the lady that lost her eye was one of them. Do they all seriously think that she won't kill them too? It's this irrational behavior that stops the film from being anything remotely interesting.You are constantly pounding your face against the wall. It also doesn't help that this type of story has been done thousands of times over. An alien of some kind is grown in a lab and it escapes and wreaks havoc. There's nothing new about his story and the film doesn't really do much to subvert that same story. Aside from it's ""twist"" there isn't anything new.Putting aside the dull, exposition-heavy story line, the most obnoxious thing about this film is the music. It's sometimes this strange electronic pop, techno sounding garbage and other times it's the old cut and paste stuff you hear in every movie. You get the ""scary"" violin stuff and the loud action music but these are both overshadowed by the sympathy music that plays almost every time Morgan is on screen. Instead of giving her a relatable persona, they just play this cheesy dumb song over the top.Outside of the excellent cinematography and solid performances, this film is nothing new. Its soundtrack is obnoxious, the characters two dimensional, and the story is the same thing you see with every film like this. It's a lazy excuse for a movie. If you've seen anything that remotely sounds like this then you've already seen this movie. So, instead of seeing this, just go watch that other thing you saw.​",Morgan

It contains the likes of Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh & Paul Giamatti (whose wee section is the most interesting part of the whole film). Nevertheless, they are let down by the writing.The Film looks good, very sharp, but as with all things in life, looks alone mean nothing.I suppose the only positive I can think of is that Rose Leslie does make a good villain.

68,rlaine,"Confusing movie, doesn't really work, but kept me watching",4,4 September 2018,"Morgan is a hybrid movie as much as the title character is a hybrid. Morgan isn't quite sure what it is and neither does this movie.The plot starts of as a ""sci-fi thinker"", there is a scene early on in the movie where Morgan - the humanoid - attacks one of it's creators and a corporate risk-management consultant is called in to evaluate Morgan. The attack scene is seen through a surveillance camera and not very graphic. Kate Mara plays the consultant very stereotypically cold corporate style and we are introduced to rest of the similarily stereotypical cast. A Jamie Oliver style cook, ""hippie"" behaviorist, nerdy scientist etc, bearded and bear like ""good guy"", super stereotypical in an annoying way, like every 90s scifi horror movie. We are also introduced to a psych analyst played by Paul Giamatti and shortly after the movie takes a somewhat unexpected turn into a gorish ""creature horror"".There are so many problems with this movie, but the biggest problem is that you are never sure whether you should like Morgan or not. It's kind of the point of the movie also, will you be fooled by the innocent looks and cute ""childhood"" videos of Morgan or put off by it's horrific actions. But the concept doesn't work, partly because rest of the movie is played as a sci-fi action ""horror"", very stylized all the way to some driving synth soundtrack over martial arts fight scenes. After a slow, but promising first half the movie turns into a super boring Alien style ""horror"" where most of the cast is killed one by one, all the way into a semi surprise ending, which doesn't save the movie tho.The movie and scenery look pretty good, cinematography is quite gorgeous. I was a bit put off by the ""filters"" used quite extensively, like they didn't believe the movie wouldn't look good enough without putting some scenes through an ""instagram filter"".I didn't know this was directed by Ridley Scott's son while watching, but it explains a few things about this movie. First, it has relatively big name cast for a ""small"" movie and also the fact that this has a lot of Ridley legacy to it, borrowing from Alien saga, Bladerunner etc. I guess Luke even went for a similar look his dad has used in many of his movies too.Certainly a missed opportunity. Big names cast, very uneven direction, confusing plot. Kind of an interesting watch, but not really a good or rewarding movie.",Morgan
69,FelipeCarrillo,Will Ridley Scott Be Proud of The Directional Debut of His Son?,3,24 September 2016,"Science fiction, a genre that stops working and self-destructs over time, it is buried into a deadline as hesitant and battered as any other genre that Hollywood exploits until the total exacerbation of it. For some time, the dearth of purely new ideas has been a cinematic pandemic that has potentially harmed the big and powerful global film studios, such alarming lack is responsible for the weekly remakes and reboots of already released movies or films with attractive outward appearance, which contain aspects and developments technically copied. This is the regrettable event of Luke Scott. Carrying upon his shoulders the 'Scott' surname must not be easy, in view that his father, the selfsame Ridley S. is responsible for some cult classic movies and one of the film directors more relevant and influential of the recent years; It may be that this pressure caused that the last film of the novice director, ""Morgan"", to deliver a film with existential and philosophical discourses, which did not fulfill what it asserted. It is a shame that Ridley would give his consent to one imitation less sophisticated and profound from ""Ex Machina"", perhaps, it was a family thing or just one explicit 'artificial intelligence'.The story by Seth W. Owen takes us into a world set in the future, in which the possibility of being a creator of life is openly feasible. Around the reused premise, a group of scientists, geographically isolated, create stable human hybrids with scientific and technological aspirations. The crux of the plot is that said perfect human being, conceived by genetic manipulation, starts to develop a more complicated thought phase, one in which humanized emotions and feelings can be unexpectedly dangerous. There is no problem in telling a story that's been told before in this kind of films, provided that they institute it a dissimilar style and a different use that aim to offer a solid and powerful contribution to the general idea. The previous rule did not regulate the film of Luke Scott, considering that besides not give an inherently intelligent response to well-known story, living in the shadow of several classics of science fiction - among them, some of his father - and tries to innovate becoming the little it had been achieved in an incoherent horror-thriller filled with unjustified violence.""Ex Machina"", the Sci-Fi surprise of 2015 is its illustrious mentor. The acclaimed work of the English novelist, screenwriter, film producer and director; Alex Garland, has a connection with most of its ambitions and motivations with ""Morgan"", even so, despite the fact that its director, Luke Scott, affirmed that was not aware of the fantastic film of Alicia Vikander until after the post- production of the film, ""Morgan"" feels like a lighter version of it, with a budget much smaller, with a completely distant approach and with wholly disconcerting results. In addition to that movie, the film seems to be based on the mythical ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley, another nightmare that has been treated in a thousand ways - thousand and one with this - in where the creation of artificial life is limited by the own human foibles. In a nutshell, ""Morgan"" does not possess the same paced of those movies, since it lacks of reflective questions that forge science fiction, questions such as: in what will a machine affect to humanity, why does it deserve to stay, will they perish someday.The infinite flaws of the movie focuses on the performances of its squandered cast. Despite having actors and actresses as prestigious as for getting some nominations in the Academy Awards, the spectrum around the film manages to diminish the potential of the cast to zero. We have an unrecognizable Kate Mara - and not precisely by her physical appearance -, who plays the main role, Lee Weathers, a cold and dry professional that takes care of finding the answer to problems with secret investigations, who from the beginning showed herself indifferent and inert. You will be taken aback with the performance of Mara, which although it is justifiable in the final stretch, exceeds the insipidness and lividity required for the character. Similarly happens with Anya Taylor-Joy, the little gem with a wonderful and blessed future of ""The VVitch"", she is hidden in almost the entire length of the film under the depth and darkness of her grey sweatshirt, giving a performance somewhat blundering and very regular in the designated role, so , comparisons with Vikander are unnecessary. Concerning what is referred the supporting cast, they verge on the ridiculous and only a few manage to explore the small potential of their characters with tenacity and peculiarities characteristic of the own actors (Rose Leslie and Michelle Yeoh). Thus, the appropriate definition for the debut of Scott would be a wasted opportunity, a poorly developed opportunity, an opportunity that should never have happened. Slow paced, formulaic and boring, ""Morgan"" takes refuge in the luxuries of ""Ex Machina"" and fatefully becomes in a thriller film that prioritizes action more than its motivations. This is the only movie with an unexpected ending that I wasn't surprised, and sadly is destined to succumb in the lugubrious and painful area of the worst films of the year. Luke, I'm sorry, perhaps next time.",Morgan

73,SpoilerAlertReviews,Not quite the horror I was expecting but still good,7,6 September 2016,"Luke Scott, Son of Ridley Scott, give us his feature debut, a sci-fi thriller that has similar elements to Ex Machina, Splice and even Blade Runner. The story is central to genetically created Morgan who is only five years old but displays immense intelligence and emotions beyond teenagers, which comes with violence. Morgan, superbly played by Anya Taylor-Joy is housed in a confined facility in the middle of nowhere where she's raised by a group of scientists responsible for differences areas of her development like Behavioural Analyst, Amy played by GoT's Rose Leslie and an unrecognisable Boyd Holbrook who's the nutritionist or chef. I couldn't place his face at first but remembered him from Run All Night after looking him up. The team also includes Michelle Yeoh, Toby Jones, Michael Yare, Chris Sullivan, Vinette Robinson and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who all give convincing performances even if only brief. Something goes wrong and Lee Weathers, played by Kate Mara, a corporate risk assessment manager is sent to do more than just investigate. Taking telephones orders from a Brian Cox who seems to have similar authority as his character in the Bourne saga. There's an eerie sense of conflict amongst everyone and there's even a hint of jealously from Mara's character. Things go from bad to worse when Paul Giamatti comes to evaluate Morgan's behaviour and the film steps up a gear. Not that it's slow, it's paced very well, introducing each of the characters and then snowballing to the finale before you figure out what's happening. However, I figured it pretty early on, being suspicious of certain characters. If there was meant to be clever twist, it didn't work for me though still a good story and reminded me of Bourne. There's a moral point here about genetics and human rights though not entirely thought provoking as the film's displays why compassion for Morgan is threw out the window. The finale is great with both Mara and Morgan showing their true colours. I might be missing something, but could there be a hint at the film Hanna, as there's mention about the Helsinki incident. But there's nothing else to indicate that this is fact. It's very similar indeed, and the end gives away a larger picture. There's a good score from Max Richter adding to the sinister backdrop of the movie, however I wouldn't as far to say this film is a horror. Eerie, and maybe a little suspenseful perhaps but not scary. It's quite cold, emotionless in parts, but that's possibly deliberate. It's a worthy watch and a great job by Luke Scott but it's not unfamiliar territory and nothing entirely original.

The trailer made it seem like this was going to be some sort of supernatural thriller with Morgan using telekinesis and so what. In reality this movie is nothing more than an action martial arts movie. You read that right, THIS IS AN ACTION MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE!I actually don't might seeing Kate and Anya engaging in fights during the second half of this movie (This movie is barely 85 minutes, not including credits) because they do a good job with the 2 - 3 fights that they have. The problem is that the fights are so chopped up and quick edited that you end up getting a headache from all the cuts in the fight. The story is interesting at the beginning but loses itself during the second half when it becomes a martial arts action movie. There is really no horror in this movie, and you can't be scared of Morgan because Anya (Actress playing Morgan) is just too good looking of a girl to be scary. Morgan isn't really a force to be afraid of since all she does is threaten people with a handgun, bite people like a dog, and perform martial arts. The characters have ZERO development besides Morgan. Kate Mara has zero character development until the final shot of the movie. The rest of the characters, you know absolutely nothing about. Yeoh is a legendary martial arts actress yet she doesn't even get to showcase her skills in this movie at all. This movie tries to bring in this philosophical element of ""even if Morgan is not human, she feels human emotion so maybe she IS human,"" but it completely abandoned all of that during the second act.Seriously, I am so happy Anya found success in Split because this movie is extremely silly and forgettable. Anya Taylor Joy (Along with the cast) deserves to be in a better film. This is one of the shortest films I have ever seen released on the big screen. It just shows that they had a cool premise but had no idea what to do with it, thus ending it as soon as possible, and with one of the worst death scenes ever for a ""villain.""There is a cool twist with Kate's character during the final shot of the film, but besides that, this movie doesn't need to be seen unless you have 85 minutes to spend.

Lee Weathers must decide whether or not to terminate an artificially created humanoid being. There some other problems happened in this story but this is the theme of this movie. this is a science fiction movie and there are lots of experiments happened in this and lots of explanation of them. But the main thing is do a humanoid creature and the creature is very intelligent and this is a threat for humanities and you have shut down this.this is not as common story line but the theme is very common and the central character is very similar to any other science fiction movie. But the main problem is it's slow paced build up and the plot development. The first half of the movie is very slow and the director takes unnecessary time to build up the story and take the audience to the center. There are lots of information and explanation about the experiment but these are took so much time. The plot is a science fiction but the director had to maintain the pace of the movie. The first half is totally made of poor direction. The second half is little bit faster but another problem is the story contained too many subplot and effects in the second half which are very difficult to digest in small time. Plot development is totally missing in the whole movie. The character development is another problem in this movie. Any of these characters has no clarification or connection to the others and I literally found no explanation why the scientist get wrong and what is the main reason for creating Morgan. Kate Mara and Paul Giamatti were trying but the script give them nothing to execute any acting glance.

They take a great twelve minute plot and stretch it into an incredibly long movie. You will find yourself checking your watch about halfway into the movie.There is also no clear idea of who the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are in this film.

Given an exceptionally talented group of actors they were able to produce the worst movie of the year.From top to bottom, this is an A list of talent but I'm sure all of them would love to erase this off their resume forever.I thought this would be an intense Sci-Fi thriller. It started out that way but then the cracks started to appear. Little things like a doctor that had been attacked played by Jennifer Jason Leigh having a bandage on her face that was all dirty and bloody. They spend millions on a secret lab but they can't afford some clean bandages? Then there are the video feeds that always have these weird glitches. Again, they spend millions on creating an A.I. being but they can't produce smooth video?This goes on and on and gets ten times worse as the movie progresses. The most idiotic scene does deserve special mention though. There is a room that they keep Morgan in that is like a prison cell of sorts that Morgan can't escape from. However, later on in the movie the Kate Mara character gets imprisoned in the same room, but wait, there happens to be a huge vent that can easily be climbed up and then a window smashed and climbed out of. So stupid.There are dozens and dozens of these serious irregularities throughout. To the point where I was just amazed at the incompetence.I have to ask the same question I ask of many terrible movies, did anybody watch this thing before it was released? Did they screen it for a focus group and get good feedback? The movie clearly had a significant budget given the scenes and quality actors. I suppose thought that they blew their load on those items and hired a 4th grader to do the rest.",Morgan
85,cmovies-99674,MORGAN was a great film with many outstanding actors to carry out difficult roles.,8,11 August 2017,"PROS: This movie had a lot going for it. To start off, there were many iconic horror actors like, Anya Taylor-Joy from SPLIT, Rose Leslie from HONEYMOON, and Toby Jones from WAYWARD PINES. The acting in MORGAN was ridiculously good as well. The actors were tasked with such a challenge, they had to really develop their characters to show the bonds that the workers in the facility would have created. A benefit from this was how believable every action was from the characters. There was little to no places in the film that could've been added or subtracted, every scene had a purpose and was done impressively. And to top it all off, the end of the movie was also well crafted. It left the viewer wondering and speculating about the film as a whole, which there again brings you back to how well all the characters were established throughout MORGAN.CONS: There was one con that I felt hurt the movie greatly. The rising action in the film was lost, it felt like it had dragged on, which is unfortunate to say the least. I felt that it fell victim to poor sound effects. I really wished that the sounds in the movie had more tension to them, in this way it could make the scenes more high strung and it would have had a greater purpose.www.chorror.com",Morgan

Given the pretense, ground breaking scientific research we should be seeing a group of highly intelligent and educated characters with exceptional communication skills - we don't. I am sure that the actors might have had some ideas on how to play these roles.

87,arturmachado-29588,GMO goes psycho,3,26 August 2017,"First feature film by Luke Scott (son of Ridley Scott), addresses a theme already explored by his father (and way better). Morgan is an artificially-created girl who, at the age of five, is already as physically developed as a teenager and with intelligence well above average. The movie attempts to exploit the conflict between her super-intelligence and her emotional control, but falls flat, because we easily realize that this premise quickly gives way to yet another movie about an ""uncontrollable killer machine"".Held at a facility in the middle of nowhere far from civilization, Morgan is monitored by the group of scientists who created her, but during one of the sessions she becomes violent and attacks one of her handlers. So, a corporate risk-management consultant arrives with a psychologist who conducts an unreliable interview: he first says he wants to conduct a face-to-face interview with Morgan and not through a glass, in order to establish a trustworthy relationship with the patient, but during that same interview he does everything to antagonize Morgan... So, what was made of the trust and professionalism expected of such a reputed psychologist? It is clear that the thing goes sour and he finishes dead.Being more than proved that Morgan does not control her murderous impulses and has to be exterminated (and even given an executive order to that end), they restrain her, but the ""brilliant"" scientists make the stupid decision to not exterminate her anymore, but instead to take her to another location to continue their work. Now, I accept that scientists may develop an emotional connection with their projects, but I do not accept that they are so stupid to the point of not realizing that said project will not hesitate to kill each one of them, and throughout the film all these scientists had ample opportunities to do so but never do it, and this is totally unrealistic: do they not have any basic survival instinct?!? It is then that finally the business consultant comes into play that predictably (although this is only revealed at the end of the movie) is another genetically modified creature that was sent to evaluate and if necessary exterminate Morgan, and from here on out the rest of the film is a game of cat vs mouse without anything special or deep about the theme of the premise. Disappointing. I give it 3/10 because the performances have much merit, but unfortunately, however good that they may be, they can never save a bad script.",Morgan
88,Oberrated,Ex Machina but more violent,6,12 September 2016,"Ah, I wanted to love this one, I really did, but there is one major thing that a friend of mine said that is as true as it could possibly get. My buddy Grant said, ""If 'Ex Machina' didn't exist, this would have been a great movie."" Bold it, italicize it, put it up on the header, scream it off the U.S. Steel tower dahntahn. In my opinion, 'Morgan' was simply 'Ex Machina' but altered around with minor plot changes and way more brutal. So what does this mean? Well, I LOVED 'Ex Machina'. It still goes down as one of my favorite movies, ever. 'Morgan', by the end of the movie, was way too much like 'Ex Machina'. Resulting in me feeling as if it was too much of a cop out to creating something original and working off of something that was done well, yet add brutality and action to it. Now with that being the second time of me bringing up the brutality aspect of the film up, 'Morgan' was a hell of a brutal movie. I did enjoy that within this film. But again, too much like 'Ex Machina'. I have seen this before and done better, might I add. Aside from the 'Ex Machina' comparison again, the acting was done quite well for what was given. I especially enjoyed Anya Taylor-Joy in 'The Witch' and she was especially cold and unforgiving as Morgan. The rest of the cast were great as well.It is not a jump scare horror, it is not a hold your breath thriller. It is an in-your-face, sub-par Sci-Fi flick.

In the movie, Morgan is referred to as a humanoid but the term is actually used for mechanical robots that look like human. In this case, Morgan is a flesh and bone character with some synthetic genes infused to her DNA and we're expected to consider her a ""thing."" This is outright silly in today's norms where we discuss the human rights of an embryo. We also understand that the first thing all ""humanoids"" excel is martial arts. Despite its pretentious philosophical dressing, the movie is all about Morgan biting off ears and noses, mauling all those crossing her path with the usual blood and gore fest.

90,makleen2,A confusing mess that doesn't raise any interesting questions about AI,5,16 September 2017,"Morgan (2016) was billed as a promising new sci-fi horror/mystery movie, but quickly falls flat. It stars Kate Mara as Lee Weathers, a ""corporate consultant,"" Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan, and Rose Leslie as a behavior specialist. Paul Giamatti makes a notable appearance as the only character with emotional depth. Going into the film, I thought it was going to explore the ethical issue of genetic manipulation and cybernetic enhancement. I thought it would pose an interesting dilemma to the audience about whether research of this nature should be pursued, like Ex Machina (2015) did for artificial intelligence. Boy, was I disappointed.First, the film was deceptively marketed. It's not a mystery and it barely passes for horror. Its IMDb summery is, ""A corporate risk-management consultant must decide whether or not to terminate an artificially created humanoid being,"" but that's not actually the plot. Spoiler alert: the end of the film reveals that the corporate consultant was actually a genetically-enhanced assassin, and the whole exercise was an excuse to see whether her version could defeat the newer version, Morgan. So, in the end, there's never a question about whether Morgan should be terminated, and the protagonist never solves a mystery–she knew what Morgan was the whole time. The result was a boilerplate chase/assassin thriller.In one of the best scenes, Paul Giamatti's character, Dr. Alan Shapiro, attempts to evaluate Morgan's emotional development and ends up inciting her to violence, kicking off the second half of the film. In the context of the first half of the film, this scene makes no sense. Morgan had already demonstrated a propensity for violence. Why did Dr. Shapiro insist on entering the room with her? Why did he provoke her when he knew she was likely to assault him? Also, when they first met she demonstrated the ability to read his mind–why did he still believe he could manipulate her? It only makes sense as a plot device to set up a battle between Morgan and Lee Weathers.Of course, this raises a huge question. If Morgan was a genetically engineered assassin, why was the corporation and her project supervisor, Dr. Lui Cheng, so concerned when she exhibited violent behavior? Why did they consider more emotional assassins to be worthy of development in the first place? Lee Weathers' cold, impersonal demeanor didn't seem to inhibit her in any way. She still accomplished her mission. If you were a multinational corporation spending billions of dollars on genetic research, would investing all those resources into making a more emotional assassin make any sense? And, would it make sense to terminate her at the first sign your research had succeeded? There were little things that bothered me too. In one scene, Lee Weathers was locked in Morgan's enclosure and escaped by climbing up a shaft and breaking out the skylight. Why couldn't Morgan have figured that out and made a similar escape? Later, she is shown effortlessly driving and executing maneuvers in a high speed chase and besting Lee Weathers in hand to hand combat. Where did she learn these skills? If the research team was kept in the dark about her ultimate purpose, I doubt they were teaching her martial arts on the side. I also find it hard to believe Morgan could quickly pick up these skills, but then not be able to figure out how to escape through the skylight.Morgan was a promising concept with a decent cast. I actually like the actors and actresses in this movie, especially Kate Mara and Rose Leslie. It's almost worth seeing just for Paul Giamatti's performance. The movie as a whole, however, was poorly executed. The entire assassin angle seemed contrived and unbelievable.If Morgan was actually as advertised–a dilemma over the fate of a genetically enhanced child who displays violent tendencies–it would have been an interesting film. Instead, that plot is undermined by boring car chases and a prolonged duel between two sociopathic, superhuman characters. Finally, the revelation at the end made everything that came before it completely meaningless. It's unfortunate the writers took it in that direction.",Morgan
91,NDbportmanfan,"An Entertaining Movie, Though It Feels Very Familiar",7,4 September 2016,"Morgan is about a risk management consultant having to decide whether or not the current artificial intelligence project should continue or be terminated. Lee Weathers shadows the scientists to see how they work with Morgan and her responses in preparation for the real psychic-evaluation the next day.I felt the story to be compelling with some minor plot holes that I chose to ignore as the overall experience was worth it. I enjoyed all of the characters and their personal relationships with Morgan as they really presented the family vibe. The pacing was good as it had plenty of time to introduce the characters and make them relatable to the audience. The movie is set at a slower pace so don't expect a lot of action or real horror elements which were kind of advertised.The movie features Anya Taylor-Joy as Morgan who really owns the role. I really believe the way she is going she will become a house hold name before too long. She reminds me of a younger Jennifer Lawrence but with better range as an actress. Kate Mara also shines as the lead character which is nice to see after the fail of a movie that was the Fantastic Four.I would rate this a little higher if it were more original but sadly it is too much of a reminder of Blade Runner, and more recently Ex Machina. The latter two created an environment so unique to the sub genre while Morgan just feels like a rehash. Morgan is still a good movie and worth a watch, but don't expect them to rewrite the book.

first of all: avoid to watch a trailer and any spoilers of the story, to have the best film experience. this review contains no spoilers.Morgan is a brilliant science fiction movie with a lot of realism in it and great acting. though the following text seems to be very theoretical, it is an intense thriller. to me there was not a single boring minute.the movie shows, how complicated it is, to create artificial human like consciousness. it shows the problems which come along with it, when a learning AI is allowed, to make decisions. And if an AI is aware of the fact, their decisions have consequences for themselves and others, then it's one step closer to the point of being conscious.creating human like consciousness is not a challenge of creating intelligence. not at all. human technology already has reached the point of better AI than human intelligence. And it will increase exponentially in the near future. in fact, intelligence has little effect on creating human like consciousness. there is a lot more what it takes. actually it's all of the things beside intelligence, which make the difference. which create consciousness and personality. our personality is the thing that tells us, what decision is the right one. to be conscious means, being aware of the fact, that our decisions have consequences for our existence, and for others. but what creates our personality? it is the result of real life experiences and how to handle them. It gets extremely complicated when we try to compute that. And it's incredibly hard when it comes to compassion, empathy, morality and conscience, how to handle our feelings and the feelings of others. experience of social interaction creates an ego which is also needed to build up a personality. all of these things make the difference between a conscious human being and a machine of pure intelligence. intelligence is the easy part. this is, what the movie is about. go and watch it, if you are interested in these things. you won't be disappointed.",Morgan

The EVIL company is just a shadow in the background, and play no part in the happenings. No character evolves at all, only the events do. The one possible good scene utilizing the tricky psychiatrist who tries and succeeds in getting Morgan to show her cards is poorly written and poorly directed.

She even says something to the effect of, ""This is what I do!""...just before getting her butt kicked. How was she able to escape the locked room so easily, but Morgan didn't think of doing the same thing? The way that Mara's character got the upper hand on Morgan was laughable. The reveal at the end was very predictable early on.Toby Jones' character was annoying just to look at. I don't know why. Maybe that was intentional.Michelle Yeoh's character could have been played by nearly anyone with the same impact. There was definitely wasted talent with this casting.Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was nearly worthless. You didn't really find out why she was attacked early on.

Without spoiling the movie, the screenplay is terrible. And you know it early on because characters act in ways that don't make sense at all. If you want to antagonize someone, just treat them badly, threaten them, and don't act surprised. But the characters do, of course, as if out of the worst dumb horror films. And the stupidity and contrived nature of the characters is done because the film must move to the next part of the script.This derivative junk doesn't know what it wants to be. It pulls pieces of various hit movies without putting it together in any coherent way. And the predictable ending itself doesn't even make sense. I don't know how Luke Scott would not see how poor this script was going, when his father created Bladerunner and numerous other classics. In my opinion the good reviews from critics are a result of lineage, not this crappy film.Sadly the actors are A list.

98,lhunt-9,Anya Taylor-Joy stakes out new territory in the dramatic portrayal of an evolved human: Her development of the character is the reason to watch this otherwise flawed film,8,31 December 2016,"Morgan (the film) was my New Year's treat. Honestly, the plot was weak, as it really felt like a short story, with more pieces missing than filled in (in fact, leaving too many issues unexplored for a full-length feature film). However, the film plays with the question of what is and is not human in the circumstance where we have the option of redesigning ourselves at the genetic template level (which we now actually do). As Hollywood basically always does, it makes our technological capacities out to be scary, so this film borders on the horror and thriller genres. And, as always, throw an evil corporation into the mix. This is all frankly stereotyped, and a little on the dumb side.... None of these sketchy plot ideas are what I found interesting, however. Rather, and similarly to Ex Machina (or even Hannah), I liked how the actors filled out their characters, especially when they had to play ""something"" that was other than human, but not non-human. The challenging dramatizations had to be handled by Kate Mara, who definitely succeeded, and Anya Taylor-Joy, a 20-year-old newcomer, who absolutely excelled. Her characterization was as successful as that of Alicia Vikander in Ex Machina, and may have even moved a step or two beyond Ms. Vikander's achievement. So... story/plot/concept: D+ / dramatic representation of a technologically evolved human by Anya Taylor-Joy: A+. For the post-human character development alone (and not really for that much else), this film marks a milestone, as state of the art. I can't think of any other film that has taken it this far.

It only barely made its $8 million budget back, and it took the international haul to tip it over the edge. Paul Giamatti was great in his small part and Anya Taylor-Joy impressed. In reality, the whole cast, side characters included, were very solid. There were a few moments of unnecessary exposition, but nothing overt. It has a dark tone and keeps the pressure up throughout.

102,paulmcuomo,I cannot recall a movie to go downhill as badly as this.,2,3 September 2016,"OK, there are very heavy spoilers in this, because to talk about the film properly, that's what has to happen.I was really excited for this movie because of both the premise sounding like there could be a load of cool concepts within it, and the cast. Ridley Scott's involvement did have me concerned - I unfortunately have only really had bad experiences with Ridley Scott bar The Martian - but I still saw it.The majority of the first part of the film, where it takes its time to explore the facilities and who everyone is and what their role is in Morgan's wellbeing is nice, with there being many characters that the actors do so well in adapting. The overall design of the film is strong, with the Scott's showing a clear expertise in how to make a film look pretty and have high production quality in terms of sets and style.This is where my positive outlook REALLY goes out the window, and from now on it's all rage. The film does away with a cool concept of the scientists being emotionally attached to this thing they've made, and then makes it into the film of smart people doing dumb things i.e. not increasing any security after the incident in which Morgan brutally stabbed out a anothers eye, allowing a deliberately provoking psychologist to go in unprepared and unprotected (spoilers, that character dies), immediately taking the restraints off her when the last thing she remembers was them agreeing to kill her and telling her she's worthless, or not teaching her anything that would be worthy to know for functioning in the real world (which is the 'explained' purpose of the program). Addition is the fact that certain characters are killed for almost no reason; I mentioned the lady who got her eye stabbed out played by a wasted Jennifer Jason Leigh...we never, EVER find out what provoked her to do this, or kill her as she does later, which is bad writing. Others I'm thinking, ""yes that person deserved that""/""Wait, why that guy?""/""Why's this person killing this person?"", which all builds up to a twist that is so bad that I saw it in the first 5 minutes but just didn't want to believe. I'll talk about it at the end.This film is mess; a hot mess that wastes so much of its cast. The best things in the film are the Cinematography, the visual style and that Anya Taylor-Joy, Toby Jones and Rose Leslie were really trying to add so much more than had, and succeeded because they are majorly talented. However, if you are going to watch this, wait for it to be on TV.OK, twist: The only performance I had a real issue with in the film was Kate Mara, as whilst she is a very quirky, fun actress, the part is completely standoff-ish and emotionless. She's less emotional than Morgan, and at this point I could see she wasn't a risk assessment analyst but likely another experiment. At the end of the film, they reveal that the L3 (lee) is superior to the M4, and she was ""perfect"" meaning she was indeed another experiment. The problem with this is that entire movie I was on the side of the scientists, and even Morgan, because of the personality they exhibited and that they weren't a blank slate, and also...they were in the right so often and things were made worse by the actions of the company. It also makes me ask a bunch of questions, such as: If the L3 was perfect, why bother making Morgan? What was the fault that needed correcting or whatever? If that was the sole purpose of the visit, why did so many other characters HAVE to die? Lee murders two people, including a cook that had no role to play in the main story; so much for ""perfect"". What purpose does Lee have to the company? Weapon? Extra help? Profit? If it's any of those, how and why? How does NO ONE pick up on any of the obvious hints of what's going on? She speaks fluent Chinese to the Chinese doctor on the project despite being there ""not long"", and knows so much info the doctors don't, has the ability to survive a long fight with Morgan and clumsily proclaims her job's to kill Morgan.The whole film I didn't want Lee to win. I'm serious, I totally sided with the 'villain', and that flip at the end put a really sour taste in not just my mouth, the audience I saw it with. And...I end there.",Morgan

The acting is believable and even though this movie will not blow your mind, it is very enjoyable. The first half drags a bit, but as things get going, the movie shows its stronger side. I found myself not being bored of it at all and Luke Scott, the son of Ridley Scott, directed this one very well. The movie looks great, the sound is top notch and Morgan is the ideal movie to just lean back, relax and open a pack of chips.",Morgan
104,bbv-69237,Good movie - worth watching,7,24 December 2016,"After reading many of the reviews (good and bad), I have decided that until IMDb offers the service to select favourite reviewers, that this will be the last review I write. I do this because there are reviewers who wouldn't know a phone was up their rear end, even if it rang. But I retire mainly because there are reviewers who just don't have my tastes in movies, and there are those that do. I only want to read the reviews of those that like most of the films I like. Then if the majority of them say a movie is OK, it is likely I will agree. And vica versa. Therefore I am wasting my time writing reviews for people who don't have my tastes in movies.This is a very good film - period. By all and any measures. The direction is exactly what needed to be done for this movie - the acting is very good - and the sound is also right. This is not a movie for a star to grace the stage with their brilliance (or several) - it is a solid example of the craft of 'old school' suspense/action movies.It is clear from watching this movie after reading many reviews, that this is far too 'intelligent' a movie for many reviewers. There is a level of understanding that requires the viewer to think. I guess too many Marvel action movies have dumbed them down, and made them demand clear and concise sequencing and plot development. Over and out - until I can read the reviews of my favourite reviewers.",Morgan
105,gemandeye1,Thinking man's Sci Fi Thriller with Horror Elements,8,9 March 2017,"While I can see why people compare this to Ex-Machina and it does have some characteristics similar to other movies, I truly think this one can stand on it's own and does so very well. Very few movies one views, especially movie buffs, can honestly say that they don't see similarities or something that reminds them of another movie. I for one often am looking for a movie that fits a certain criteria. With that you will get the similarities. Plus this was a smart movie meaning not just some action sci-fi for a dumbed down audience. There was some intellect put into this film. The acting in this movie was A-Grade and many familiar faces playing supporting roles. The story successfully blended sci-fi (yes, along the lines of Ex-Machina, Westworld, and even Terminator), with psychological horror (think Legend of Hell House and The Other Ones). Not saying all will but I did predict the ending early on but I'm thinking the makers of this film wanted people to have that thought as a possibility (no spoiler given). The violence, while I wouldn't call it gory, was realistic and very well placed throughout the movie.",Morgan
106,makka-00955,Better than Ex-Machina,5,6 December 2016,"I've seen comparisons with Ex Machina and whilst they are similar in plot, this one stands up better. The acting is good and there are, at least, a few more cast members. Kate Mara's character was a little obvious, so the ending was no real surprise, but it' a nice twist if you don't guess the outcome. It's definitely watchable if you don't take it too seriously. I'm not sure it belongs in the 'horror' category and it's not really 'sci-fi' in feel either, so I've no idea what genre it falls into. The movie is enjoyable enough and I wouldn't put anyone off watching it. There is no real explanation as to why 'Morgan' suddenly turns from a lovable little girl into a psycho bitch and that could have been further explored, instead of it becoming a bloodbath - so the movie's message, or purpose, is lost from the moment the doctor becomes history. Toby Jones pops up in yet another movie and he manages a reasonable American accent. I'm sure there is much better to come from Luke Scott in the future.",Morgan
107,HorrorFreak1997,a pleasant surprise,8,3 September 2016,"Morgan directed by Luke Scott is a sci-fi horror film about a group of scientists who have artificially created a humanoid being. after a grisly event a corporate risk management consultant is sent to deal with the situation by determining whether or not this being which goes by the name of Morgan should be terminated.this film was a pleasant surprise. Luke Scott crafts a genuinely masterful sci-fi horror film here with some depth and excellent pacing. the film starts of with a gruesome and shocking scene that really sets the tone. directly after this scene we move into some expository sequences that deliver some good characterization and a great sense of what each characters motivations are. we understand how most if not all of the scientists feel about Morgan and the project/goal that they are working towards. although many of the characters are not very complex they each have clear motivations and emotions towards Morgan and their task as scientists and this makes the film have emotional impact and adds to the horror of the story. after we are given enough information to propel the plot forward and set the foundation for what's to come the film picks up speed and doesn't hold back. the story is told at a smooth and brisk pace, simply escalating more and more out of control. I will not spoil anything but I will say there is a scene involving an interrogation that is so masterfully directed and acted, that it really creates some overwhelming tension and suspense. this scene allows us to delve into the mind of the mystery that is Morgan and see how she deals with certain emotions and how these emotions affect her actions. or how she may use certain emotions to evoke a certain response from others. the beauty of this scene though is that while it does give enough depth to the character of Morgan by showing us she isn't just a mindless killer without emotions, it also adds to the suspense and tension of the film by not fully diving into these ideas and leaving us questioning sometimes what Morgan will do. another smart decision because the pacing of the film wouldn't have been as good as it was if we got anymore characterization. the pace would've slowed and the film would have dragged a bit. with the release of Ex Machina just a year earlier I believe this was a smart move for the director. both films have a similar plot and that makes it very important for this film to be able to stand on it's own as a horror rather than a drama like Ex Machina. I will say this movie does just that. while it does have dramatic elements in terms of its narrative, it only has just just enough to ensure the story has enough depth to be a solid horror film with emotional impact. this is how it differentiates itself from Ex Machina. it knows it's a horror film and embraces that. after the interrogation scene the story picks up the pace yet again and speeds its way towards its climax. which I will say without spoiling anything is excellent and I did not see the twist coming until a moment before it was revealed. I have a feeling many viewers will leave the theatre with smiles on their faces. for the most part each character that was of any importance to the plot has his or her scene of closure. their stories add to both the horror and the drama. the acting in this film is superb. everyone involved did an excellent job. this film would not have been as effective as it was if the acting wasn't as effective as it was. the editing was excellent throughout with the exception of the fight sequences. I don't exactly know what happened there but the fight scenes were terribly directed as well as edited to pieces. this was very underwhelming and annoying. far to many cuts and instances of shaky cam. the pacing was brisk and effortless. the script was carefully crafted, it produced scenes of horror, drama, suspense and an overall cohesive and emotional sci-fi horror story that I will remember for years to come.the verdict: 8.5/10",Morgan

The son of a rich,talented, successful director needed to cut his teeth on his first directing job. Pick a popular genre, horror. No point in making a movie in a small market, say an Eskimo Sword and Sandal. Pick a script that doesn't need a big budget, no special effects, just a few run of the mill stunts. No big studio sets, film it in the wilderness. Have a small cast, save on payroll. But spend a generous portion of the budget on a good professional cast, but on the other hand you don't need A listers. This is a savvy way you cut your teeth in the movie business.But... the ball was dropped on one crucial guideline, though.

110,sherripadgitt-55536,Good Movie on Human AI,6,18 June 2017,"Morgan is an AI developed from synthetic dna and human cells. She was the 3rd such version as the first two tries had failed with mutations. The idea with Morgan is that they want the AI to feel emotions. Morgan grows incredibly fast. Is able to walk, talk, smile, and enjoy herself outside with her caretakers at just 1y/o when she appears to be around 6 or 7. Most of the movie though occurs with Morgan appearing in her teen years.Morgan feels both good and bad emotions, with her negative emotions affecting her in a dangerous way. In fact she had just assaulted one of her caregivers because she was kept from going outside, which she loved. Due to those circumstances, the corporation sends in a risk management specialist to interview all employees there at the facility as well as Morgan. The specialist lacks emotion and is pretty straight forward; and calls Morgan an ""it"" instead of a ""her"".The movie had an interesting concept which was similarly done in another movie I watched a couple of years back. I'm giving this 6 stars due to a few things. I felt the acting was done well for the most part and the plot was good. The movie did leave out a lot of details and the character of Morgan doesn't grow much on the audience. More time should have been spent developing Morgan's personality...let the audience feel more what she feels. I think more time should have been given to detail more how the process of developing Morgan came about.I recommend watching this movie....some may love it, others may feel as I do about it.

The bonding between the research team and Morgan is weak, what is the meaning of special? Why Morgan is special? How special she could be? No. We don't know, so we the audience cannot feel resonate.The story development in first 30 minutes is good, subtle and fine, but the following hour is going south, directionless and clueless, too much fight scene too little proper interaction.

You could almost guess what motivated Lee Weathers to do her job so very well and a few times she gave the viewer a small clue. Overall it was great, a nice quiet yet mysterious start, a secluded place with a bit of mystery, the killing of Paul Giamatti was satisfying because we did not like his character (harsh, mean, condescending, etc.). Michelle Yeoh was very good, thank heavens for that she has had some crappy roles and deserves more. Did I mention Kate Mara mad the movie? I would watch her floss her teeth for 90 minutes. As to the story, it is timely in this day of genetic experimentation and the love of Moragn, the creation by the lab staff was a good human emotion to include so we could all climb on board, just like when Paul G became a hated character so we could all enjoy his demise.

Fortunately they would be incapable of it. A robot such as a self-driving car must obey rules. In the case of self-driving cars, the rules are the same as for humans that drive cars. This story ignores many of the fundamental concepts that real AI designers would be familiar with and consider critical. Even up to the very end, the scientist's techniques are totally inconsistent with the reality that real robot scientists would do.Have you heard the story of Microsoft using Twitter to teach their AI chatbot (called ""Tay"")? The result of that was that Tay quickly (within a day) learned to swear and behave in other immature ways. It is a true story. The point is that it was not the programming that was the problem, it was just how the program was taught.This movie treats Morgan the robot as a complete, inseparable whole whereas in fact man-made intelligence would be a combination of many pieces (technologies) and success or failure of one would not necessarily mean the other would succeed or fail.",Morgan

117,atmobilemail,A very good movie!,8,25 January 2017,"This movie is in line with The Machine, Ex-Machina, and Humans (TV series). Similar to those three, it has a certain subdued ''British'' feel to it without it being an actual British movie, and not quite being on the same level. However, it is - in my opinion - an extremely good movie in spite of what some reviewers mentioned. First of all, the ''electronic'' music is sparse, and only adds to the coldness and spookiness of certain moods when it is there. One reviewer raised a list of questions that were apparently unanswered in the movie. I answered all of them. I won't list every single one, as this is not a ''reply '' to his post. Suffice it to say that, yes, the movie does explain why one of the people in Morgan's entourage got stabbed in the eye. Kate Mara is excellent in every way, as is Anya Taylor-Joy. The rest of the cast - except for the Chinese doctor perhaps - alas, pale in comparison. Some people criticized the ending. If you ''expect'' a typical Hollywood ending, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you're accustomed to the European, Asian, or Philip K. Dick type of endings, you'll be rewarded. 8/10 for me.",Morgan

Now if Mara's character is cut from the same cloth...I the film was super predictable. I suppose if viewers hadn't concluded that Mara was the same type of being then the movie holds water but after the fall out of the window, who wouldn't have figured out what she was.

Also some decent setting-projectiles & story through-lines are apparent despite oversights such as the kitchen or the majority of the enormous house, which is left unexplored an perfunctory. What lacks most is character development for the supporting cast (Jennifer Jason Leigh is wasted, plus Paul Giamatti is under-utilized, especially when his character is murdered and then nothing is said or cleaned up despite his busy schedule!) Also be wary of noticeable plot- holes, such as a lack of reinforcements for Kate Mara's character. Most ultra-violent action scenes do deliver if you like that sort of thing.

The location setting as well was pretty in and around some isolated laboratory in the woods. I cannot think of any special outstanding camera work or editing that stuck within my mind after watching the film, but when the programme became more fast-paced and tense, the cuts of the shots and the film score were tight and gripping.I didn't find the characters very deep or well thought out, such as the psychiatrist Dr. Alan Shapiro who seemed to be dropped into the film only to develop Morgan's story and character as well as the rest of the characters. However, Morgan and the protagonist Lee Weathers were very intriguing characters who both had interesting traits and wanted to know where their fates were taking them, with Lee you can see she is a very assertive professional detective of some sort who comes across mysterious, confident and real tough. She has been introduced to the organisation to assess Morgan and potentially terminate her. Morgan other than being some artificial genetic experiment seems to be emotionally tangled and mentally unstable which is initially driving the plot. But it runs deeper than that, this mental and emotionally instability attribute although not completely original as it has happened many times before; one would think primarily thanks to Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' it is done in what I felt was a unique way, right from the start we see Morgan cold bloodedly murder an innocent person so we feel shocked and intimidated by her presence and her being. But as the story develops her character does and she is very complicated as is her existence in our reality, which is somewhat soaked up in flashbacks of her bonding with 'Amy' and her previous and current conflicts with moral judgement, justification and understanding and that to me was the most interesting part of this film.I liked the conflict because it is the part I can understand and relate to, constantly questioning and being questioned by my own and other's morality in judgement, justification and understanding, who are we to judge? What is right and what is wrong, the line of morality in which some cross and others don't is invisibly mirrored metaphorically in this film in the form of a transparent glass wall separating us from Morgan, which inevitably fails its purpose.I give this experimental dark sci-fi horror a 6.5 out of 10.",Morgan

140,Izzy_Z,Too many idiots for one room,3,2 December 2016,"Aside from being contrived and predictable from the get go, this movie is just statistically unrealistic. You can't possibly expect so many people in any given group or setting to be so haphazardly idiotic and lacking any character one could sympathize with. Even the ""good"" characters always seem to choose the most difficult and retarded way of action as opposed to the simplest and most obvious.But then, ""contrived"" is flavor of the month, alas. There seem to be too many of these movies lately as if preparing us for... oh, I don't know, some sort of robot invasion for the lack of a better word? What's worth, the viewer is somehow expected to empathize with these contrived emotions.If it was supposed to be a revelation of sort, it failed just as miserably as Ex Machina. Perhaps, there's just no good way to convey a story of this kind given its inherent conundrum.",Morgan

142,donuts_69,"Underwhelming, predictable debut from Luke Scott",4,6 September 2016,"Heading into the cinema for the screening of Morgan, my expectations were fairly modest. I knew little about the movie itself other than the basic premise put forward in the trailer.In the opening 5 mins, I was immediately reminded of recent Sci-Fi sleeper, ""Ex Machina"". Set in a remote forest research facility, our protagonist ""Lee Weathers"" (Mara) is sent in with a brief to assess a recent incident involving a secret biological experiment and the viability of the project continuing. Isolated at the facility for the duration of the project (7 years) she is also given details that the team may be further involved in the incident than first glance would have her believe. Weathers is warned that ""another Helsinki"" would be harmful to the company and she should act to prevent any further incidents.We are introduced to the research team, Toby Jones as senior lead doctor and Michelle Yeoh as the overseer, and survivor of the Helsinki incident are familiar faces. Rose Leslie and Jen Jason Leigh are also involved, though only Leslie is given enough material to be anything more than a sketched out character. The rest of the group are cutouts, involved in someway but entirely unremarkable or memorable in any way.Anya Taylor-Joy, who broke out earlier this year with her performance in ""The Witch"", is ""Morgan"" - the biologically engineered experiment whose DNA was synthesized in the lab in a way that would also allow Nano-bots to be introduced in order to expedite her development and heighten her abilities/intelligence.With the stage set and me having bought into the premise, ""Morgan"" then failed to deliver anything surprising, suspenseful or dramatic. I did enjoy seeing Paul Giamatti roll in (just in time) to liven things up a bit by interrogating ""Morgan"" to assess her on a psychological level and the scene does stand out as the best in the movie. Taylor-Joy more than holds her own as she bubbles to life under Giamatti's needling approach and the climax sees the movie into its second act. Still, I had to question why a known violent biological experiment, whose psychological state was unknown, would be completely unrestrained during a face to face with Giamatti's character.The second act of the movie involves the team, supposedly intelligent and reliable individuals, making dumb decisions in order to ""protect their work"" which just grates and sees the film descend into a last man standing affair.Toby Jones hangs himself when he thinks Morgan has been euthanised, but as an audience we cant feel any loss because he is never afforded any depth or decent screen time.Jen Jason Leigh sleeps the entire movie then shows up in order to add to the body count.Michelle Yeoh mumbles her way through her role before trying to deliver some kind of poignant video log farewell during which Morgan interrupts and kills her.Token African American characters, who are given so little to work with I cant even remember their names or why they were in the film, are killed off without a second glance.After the fodder has been dealt with, the third act has Weathers (Mara) and the facilities hunky chef, Skip (Boyd Holbrook) chasing Morgan (Taylor-Joy) and Dr. Amy (Leslie) through the forest. Fortunately, Skip ""knows where they're headed"" and the chase doesn't last long.The final scenes of the film, where the ""big twist"" is revealed comes far too late and without any emotional punch or ""whoa"" factor. The lack of subtlety throughout the film gives the game away which is why the rest of the film falls flat, we know what's coming so just hurry up and get there.The ending plays out far too safely and I was left wondering what the movie actually wanted to be defined as. It only scratched the surface of any moral issues surrounding the concepts within the film (Biological engineering the obvious one). It was also unable to deliver on being any one of Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller/Horror purely through a lack of any major elements that contribute to owning those genres.The main thing for me was Mara's character, I never once bought into her role and I think she really struggled with the complexities of her character and bringing what was required to the screen.Given the meagre budget of the film and being the directorial debut for Son of a Gun, Luke Scott, I guess it is unsurprising that not every note was hit (or even played) in Morgan.I do however, believe that Anya Taylor-Joy's star is rising and we should see more of her in future.Oh, special mention - Brian Cox is such a great actor, I love most of his on screen roles, but I will never understand why he is continually under utilized. Great talent (Jones and Giamatti too for that matter) but wasted here for this.Better luck next time - 4/10",Morgan
143,dandhyoon,A fine cast derailed yet again by stupid and lazy writing.,3,17 December 2017,"I don't write reviews, but the acting talent wasted by the crap script and inept directing has compelled me to write.The biggest problem was that it's never made apparent to the viewers why the staff protects Morgan even though they had just viewed the mayhem she's caused.
The moronic and nonsensical actions of the highly educated staff makes me think the writer believes all of us are this stupid except that the last presidential election has shown otherwise; only half of us are willing to protect someone in the face of certain death and destruction.The moment Lee shoots Amy dead was the highlight of the third act for me.
While everyone apparently followed the ""How to do nothing while a coworker gets mauled to death"" company handbook, Amy was the worst offender of them all.
She had about 4-5 chances to stop Morgan or at least warn others of their impending doom.
Then there's Skip, the useless cook, who had a rifle pointed at Morgan and thought the only reason she was acting this way was because no one had asked her not to.I watched to the end purely out of hope the fine cast would turn this around.
Alas, I was disappointed yet again.",Morgan
144,marcwiechmann,No 'Ex Machina' - still worth a watch,5,20 January 2017,"There are not many movies out from the ""science fiction"" genre out there, that are well done and worth a watch - ""Morgan"" tries very hard to be one of those. Although it does not entirely succeed, you can watch this one without being bored.The acting is well done besides Kata Mara's performance. This might be subjective view, since I never liked Kata Mara at all. I think she is a very one dimensional actress, but well, that might be just my opinion. In this movie her performance is underwhelming, and also she gives away the ""big twist"" pretty early in the game by the way she acts. I don't wanna lie, I figured it out basically after 5 minutes, and I guess, so will you. This is what did cost ""Morgan"" 3 to 4 stars from the start.It is filmed very well, I liked the cinematography, and I liked the soundtrack. What I did not understand was why so many big names were wasted. Jennifer Jason Leigh was in it, Paul Giamatti was in it, Rose Leslie was there, Michelle Yeoh was in it. And they all get like two minutes of screen time and had no opportunity to shine. Well, Giamatti a bit maybe, if you like overacting a lot.The movie, as other reviewers already stated, is very obviously a try to be ""Ex Machina"", but heavily lacking the smart charm and very good and thought through script of this exceptional movie. Still...I liked the idea of the movie, and I immediately routed for Morgan as a ""person"". So, as probably many of you guys will, I hoped all the time she will ""win"" and overcome the situation, but here we go again, it is no ""Ex Machina"". I hated Kata Mara's character, and the end was...meh. Not because of the idea, but because of the explanations, that you get in the end - they are the direct opposite of what you see on screen and make you questions the basic decisions of the company even more. But go and find out, maybe you will like it.Also important: this is NOT a horror movie. This is an absolutely standard science fiction flick. It had it's flaws but kept me fairly entertained for the entire runtime, so my vote is 5 out of 10.",Morgan
145,jyuktirat,Missing Something,5,2 July 2018,"Hardly a thriller. I think maybe 10 minutes could be counted as being a thriller. Aside from that, the concept is good. The followthrough not so much. How they had the subject act and respond was lackluster. The rest of the acting is fine. I think the story's details and background were missing. They did give some back story. But as far as beyond the immediate sigular character it doesn't give you much reason to care about any character in the movie.",Morgan
146,desertbear34,Better than Ex Machina and Splice,9,1 February 2017,"Going into this I was very much convinced it would be a copy of Ex Machina or Splice, neither of which I thought was spectacular, just OK. However, I think I preferred this over either of the aforementioned movies.It is closer in plot and ideas to Splice, but does have some traits from Ex Machina but only in that it addresses the moral dilemma of where ""human"" begins or is defined. Morgan went beyond the two previous movies in that it was looking at multiple people's view of the subject instead of just two persons views like Ex Machina. It shows a dynamic of a team of individuals and how they view Morgan as opposed to how ""The Company"" views it.Where this movie kicks into overdrive is the last 20 minutes. The truth about the company rep, Kate Mara, comes to life as well as the truth about Morgan. All and all, this is better than Ex Machina, which was good but bordered on boring, and Splice which was too stiff and poorly executed as a whole. Reviewers are saying it is a take off of those, which it is, but it succeeds where those two failed. Also, on a personal note, those folks comparing it to the movies that came before it, are the same ones that will tell you all remakes stink, instead of looking at a film as its own piece of work and NOT comparing it to others.",Morgan
147,speakers,"Sets the scene well, but then fades away",6,15 June 2017,"The story is simple; scientific experiment goes wrong, see ""Splice"", ""Ex Machina"", ""Frankenstein"" et al.The acting is as good as the script allows, but Kate Mara is particularly badly served. At one point she even says, ""Let me do my job!"", and then proceeds to do it very badly indeed. Hunting in a forest with hundreds of hiding places and a scoped rifle, she stands behind a tree and is immediately spotted by her prey.Not sure why Michelle Yeoh turned up, the script seemed to want a mother figure for Morgan and Toby Jones (wasted) was not it. I think she gets about five lines of dialogue, but several paragraphs of exposition.Everyone else is a bit pathetic; the story tries to set up the family vibe that Morgan was brought up into, but there are too many characters to give them all an adequate back-story and it ends up being confused.The one light is Ana Taylor-Joy as Morgan. Her otherworldly beauty fits the part well, her expressive face conveys every emotion and she sells the role perfectly.The direction is quite flat, there are no surprises in shot composition (apart from a weird SteadyCam shot in the forest, which wasn't quite sure where it was pointing). From not enough cuts in the slow sections, there are too many in the fight scenes; longer takes would make them feel more brutal and real.And why does this film have so many famous people playing minor roles: Brian Cox, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Paul Giamatti(brief appearance, but effective)? Did the director call in a huge bunch of favours? Give unknowns a chance, might have been cheaper too.""Ex Machina"" shows what you can do in a closed environment, but this just feels like a wasted opportunity, with many plot-holes. If she is being bred as a weapon, who is giving her the training she will need; her ""family"" is far too insipid for that. If she has telepathic skills and can mind-read names and biographical details, that would help her massively in a fight, but she doesn't use them.The ending is nice and tidy, but would have benefited from being more obtuse and less pat.Ultimately this film doesn't know what it wants to be, horror or SF, and ends up being neither, which is a shame.",Morgan
148,knight_ca,Decent but nothing new,6,3 September 2016,"A corporate risk assessor is called in to determine whether to terminate an artificial being after an incident. This tag-line may make you think of an intelligent movie that perhaps delves into the nature of emotion and whether they can be simulated by an AI. And, this is what Morgan deliversin its first half anyway.Kate Mara takes the lead in Morgan as the aforementioned assessor through whose eyes we see the experiment into artificial life gone wrong. A remote estate in the middle of nowhere provides the setting with a team of scientists shut off from the outside world as they attempt to develop synthetic life. Mara's Lee Weathers probes into the pseudo-family who seem a little overprotective of their creation and it isn't long before the cracks begin to show.The first half of the movie presents an intriguing analysis of emotion and whether they can be truly emulated by an AI. Paul Giamatti enters as a psychoanalyst who is tasked to determine Morgan's viability. In this interview scene, Morgan asks if artificial life can only perceive emotions as a preconditioned response to a given event and cannot truly simulate the complexity experienced by humans. There is talk of the 'correct' emotional response from the AI that hints at programming rather than feeling and this is a fascinating exploration. However, Morgan quickly runs out of steam with this and shifts tack rather abruptly to a formulaic action movie. That isn't all bad as the action is quite suspenseful but it's disappointing if you wanted something deeper.The second half of the movie is consumed with the scientists' protection of their prodigy and it all seems so familiar that it's like watching Ex Machina again. The parallels with this earlier movie are stark but perhaps improved upon somewhat. The woodland setting makes for some good location shots and the cast as a whole do a good job. Boyd Holbrook, the team's chef, stands out as the human element of the movie but is underused and doesn't quite add the contrast to the artificial that he could have.Returning to the comparison with Ex Machina, Morgan takes the formula and improves upon it by twisting the ending so we're given a more satisfying conclusion. Although the final revelation may dawn on you a short time before it happens, it's interesting nonetheless, and much better than Ex Machina's limp finale.Morgan isn't quite a thinking movie and it isn't quite a fully- fledged action movie. It's a little of both and doesn't quite make the successful merger that it could. It's a good 90-minutes' entertainment but it's all been done before so there is little new here. Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it but will probably forget about it by tomorrow.",Morgan

Because this movie has it all: good cinematography, a stellar cast (you could make a complete Marvel movie with these actors) and an interesting story.And yes, it is not a perfect movie, but at least it is entertaining, the actors are good (except.

151,tqrecords,"Lazy writing, but not a horrible waste of time",5,17 January 2021,"Morgan is film that failed because it didn't know what it wanted to be. It doesn't have the boldness to justify as a R-rated horror thriller, nor does it have an intelligent screenplay to accompany its themes of an AI psych thriller - both of which it was trying to go for.In the film, Lee Weathers (Kate Mara), a ""risk-management specialist"", is called to evaluate whether or not the company she works for, SynSect, is to terminate a humanoid being hosted at a rural site. The project refers to the humanoid as Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). And from the trailer, we see that Morgan shows concerning behavioral traits - including an incident wherein she stabs one of her doctors in the eye - which is why ""corporate"" has to step in. The doctors all seem to love Morgan, referring to her violent actions as honest mistakes. However, Lee Weathers is only there to do a job and doesn't seem to have any interest in humanizing Morgan. She is just there to weigh the risk of keeping the project afloat.This film is not intelligent, especially considering others films in the same genre such as Ex Machina and the brilliant HBO series Westworld which released around the same time. The characters who all take care of Morgan seem to have developed a love for her, but the direction of the film doesn't lead the viewer to contemplate the relationships between genetically created organisms and humans. This is really just about a kick-ass robot (they don't explain why it can kick ass either). It had a great cast, good action sequences, and a satisfying ending which may have been obvious and predictable to some. Also, Paul Giamatti shows up halfway through the film to do a straight up ask-questions shoot-later psych evaluation. He has an excellent performance, although given the circumstance, his character made some questionable decisions.I admit one of the primary reasons I watched till the end was Kate Mara (yeah, I have a bit of celeb crush on her not gonna lie). She is great in the film throughout. And Anya Taylor-Joy is excellent in her role as well. She does a fascinating portrayal of a machine displaying human emotions and human misunderstanding of them. I'm thrilled to see her continue on to great lead roles. Kate Mara needs to be in more films. I especially liked her in American Horror Story: Murder House as the crazed ex-lover and homewrecking patient, Hayden.I like to see that Ridley Scott's kids are doing their thing. I suggest they keep experimenting with the artform. That said, Morgan is an experiment that could have succeeded, but underwhelmingly failed.",Morgan
152,PopSpective_net,Good movie but misses out on potential,7,2 September 2016,"Morgan starts with a simple premise of the moral and ethical implications of genetically crafting a biological being from scratch. Even if such a being looks and acts human, is it? Is the being a ""she"" or an ""it""–and does the being have rights or autonomy, or can it be owned like a pet, or an iPhone? Based on nothing more than the trailers, the movie struck me as a sort of biological / genetic mirror of Ex Machina. That turns out to be true to an extent, but Morgan doesn't do as good a job of exploring the philosophical question or examining the humanity of the being. The question is sort of posed, and then quickly falls aside as Morgan turns into more of a blood and guts action flick.There is a twist at the end that I actually didn't see coming. My son says it was obvious early on, but the first hint I got was only moments before the truth of the twist was revealed.I enjoyed the movie–and I recommend you go see it. I just feel like there was much more potential there to really dig into the philosophical issues and ethical debates of creating a genetic hybrid.I had a chance to speak to director Luke Scott after seeing Morgan, and we dove into those issues a bit further. Scott told me that in his opinion the basic premise of Morgan is entirely plausible. ""A lot of the background science–of course it's a fantasy that we made–but a lot of the background science is rooted in truth."" We talked some about the similarities and differences between the premise of Ex Machina and the premise of Morgan–a cybernetic android being versus a genetic hybrid biological being. Scott shared his belief that the technical possibility of creating something as advanced as the android in Ex Machina is far beyond our abilities, but Morgan, and the ability to create a biological being, is within our reach.""The science is there,"" explained Scott. ""The only thing holding us back is a moral question."" It is a valid and important moral question, too. If a company like Monsanto can create genetically modified seeds to produce healthier or more bountiful crops and own a patent on that seed, would we allow a genetic engineering company to craft healthier or more capable gene pools and own a patent on those genes? Could we create a society where those with the financial resources are able to purchase superior genetics–thereby artificially widening the gap and creating a population of genetic ""Haves"" and ""Have Nots""? Or, would we deem a genetically modified or engineered being to be less than human–a thing or creature that can be owned, rather than a sentient being with rights? Those are all great questions to explore, but Morgan really just scratches the surface of them.I asked Luke Scott what's next on his horizon, and he let me know he's working on a project that also comes with a moral and ethical dilemma, but this one is based on a true story. Scott told me he is working on a script based on a book describing the story of the Donner Party–a group of homesteading pioneers that got caught in bad weather and stranded on a glacier and had to resort to cannibalism to survive.",Morgan

Even the ending which reveals that Lee Weathers is also artificially created, is not adding anything to the plot as it is quite obvious from the very beginning.

In fact, that alone makes me want to re-watch the movie to pick up on clues that were sprinkled throughout the movie.Anya Taylor-Joy is well cast as Morgan and she does a good job expressing the conflicting and confusing emotions of an AI human who is only five years old and still learning. After watching this and The Witch, I look forward to future Taylor-Joy movies.However, Morgan would have been improved with better character development in the supporting cast. Or maybe just pare down the size so we could feel sympathy for them. Paul Giamatti's character for instance, wasn't much more than an extended cameo and could have been eliminated. I would have loved to have seen more of the day-to-day life that Morgan lived at the institute, how she was treated, and how she related to the staff. As it is, we only see Morgan as she is presently with just a few video clips of her as a ""child"". More insight into her five years of life would have been fascinating.

160,matthew-male,A film of two halves. Your emotions got you killed!,7,13 March 2021,"'Morgan' starts really well with an interesting premise, a secret AI program being visited by a corporate investigator called in after the AI in question (Morgan, an artificially created but biological human) starts to go a bit crazy, and things aren't quite right with the way the scientists are running the program. The first third of the film is a good analysis of what is and isn't human, the science of the project, and started to remind me a bit of Bladerunner, especially the psych evaluation (which also goes badly wrong). The only thing that is problematic in the first half is that the scientists are all very annoying and pretty stupid (what is it with the Scott's for writing idiot characters?) but oddly enough that actually works out well later on as you will see...Suddenly though the film breaks into an fight/action movie, with faux martial arts fights and several vicious slaughters as Morgan breaks out. To be honest though at that point I had had enough of the overly liberal and overly emotional scientists and their desire to protect Morgan at any cost (even after she's killed someone) and I wanted them all dead. The most satisfying thing is... that's exactly what happens, she kills them all! Their stupid emotional attachment to Morgan is their downfall, and I was pretty much cheering Morgan on at this point as she butchered them in various interesting ways. Inevitably there is the final boss fight at the end, and a couple of unexpected executions and one extremely satisfying one. Never in a film have I ever wanted to see a character die so badly as Amy, the 'behaviorist'. That felt good.There is a slight 'twist' at the end, although it's easy to guess what that is nearer the start and certainly easy to spot once the fighting starts.I'm giving it 7/10 rather than 5/10 because I'm glad Luke Scott killed off all the annoying characters (his dad should take a leaf out of his book here).The two lead women were brilliant. With Anya Taylor Joy bringing the same other-worldy presence she displayed in Split and The Witch, and Kate Mara was superb as Lee Weathers, and that character should get a film sequel in my opinion.",Morgan

It's listed as a Horror movie. It is not a horror movie. 3. I guess some of the acting could be better. Overall, it's really not that bad. 4. It has elements that Ex Machina lacked. It's fast-paced and there are actual action scenes. It's not as drawn out either. 5. I am disappointed that Paul Giamatti only appears in one scene. Also, Taylor-Joy was an interesting choice for Morgan. I look forward to seeing her in the upcoming Split.",Morgan
163,mwrinkle1,Scott the lesser,3,18 September 2016,"I don't expect the Scott's son will no more make a name for himself than Fraser Heston did. The movie is a poor update of a Frankenstein's tale which it can't quite pull off. Which it seems to realize and to make up for it with turning it into a half ass martial arts action flick. The characters and plot have no real development. It doesn't even try to be a science fiction film in the sense of trying to explain the experimentation in any detail. The protagonist is a Risk Management Officer of all things and inexplicably has weapons and martial arts training. Furthermore the antagonist is a bioengineered weapon who easily defeats anyone who come sup against her except of course the protagonist who she has trouble dispatching. I really had trouble sitting through this. If you want much better want a much better acted, scripted and directed file with a science made monster theme then see Nearer to God.",Morgan

Until the very last minute I was neither disappointed nor satisfied with the movie, but when I figured out what Lee Weathers really was, I was stunned. Seconds ago I had considered her unnatural actions (like killing Skip Vronsky) a negative point, and I am a little surprised that I did not see that twist about Lee's nature coming. It makes sense though, and explains many aspects of the movie that might have been debatable until then, for example Dr. Lui Cheng asking Lee whether they met before which Lee denies.I have to admit that I still was utterly surprised discovering the fact that Lee herself (or itself, considering her resistance against assigning a gender to Morgan) was not entirely human. I did not see it coming and it was presented very well. The timing of Lee turning her hands and the dialogue of the executives of the company was excellent.Morgan is not one of the best movies I have seen (not even close), but it managed to surprise me in an unexpected moment.",Morgan
168,coryjayw,Good enough to watch for free,4,3 December 2016,"It's rare that a movie is written and directed and unfolds in a completely satisfying and fulfilling way - this is definitely not one of them. I understand an occasional twist that is slightly annoying, HOWEVER it's extremely frustrating to have to sit through a scene (or 2 or 3) that simply defies all logic. I also understand that things have to go a certain direction in order to set up and connect scenes - but with just a little creativity the same outcome could be produced in a more believable and satisfying way.Spoiler alert.Morgan had definitely already displayed the behavior of a ruthless, non-stopping, unfeeling, cold blooded killer and one of the characters had a perfect opportunity to shoot her with a high powered rifle at close range but instead he points it at the ground, holds up his hand and says ""stop, just stop"", continues to walk towards her and waits to aim when he's close enough for her to deflect the barrel.That scene alone was enough to ruin the whole movie for me (and there's another one equally as bad a few minutes later). Again, I understand that she could obviously not be killed off at that moment but the writer, director...hell the KEY GRIP could have come up with a better way to make that scene more congruent and believable.The movie really did have potential but when it starts crossing the line into completely cliché' moves and causes the audience to scream at the characters in disbelief and anger then it's lost most of its credibility and impact.Another character tries to shoot her in the forest with the same rifle but misses. She sees the direction Morgan heads in yet she continues to stare off into the opposite direction and casually flips her hair out of her face and slowly moves the bolt action to load another shell.I literally said out loud ""She'll be behind you in 30 seconds""...sure enough there she was.For the MOST part I found the movie bearable, somewhat satisfying and not completely predictable but those two scenes knocked about 3 stars off of it for me.",Morgan
169,mpcoscino,Soulless,5,26 June 2017,"One of more than a few recent femme-fatale movies in recent years, including Hanna, Columbiana, and the soon to be released Atomic Blonde; however, Morgan fails to make us care about its characters and in particular its namesake character Morgan. One reviewer leaves IMDb because he claims others do not like the movies he likes and that those who disagree with him must be less intelligent. And yet, we are the childish ones.Well, Mr. BB, let me give you and others a hint of what makes a good movie. A good story makes for interest. Morgan fails at this as we see no redeeming values in her character. When she is on the table and about to be euthanized there is no wanting to see her get up or fight back. I found myself wanting Kate Mara's character to end her in their fight scenes. Even the doctors who 'raised' Morgan have no empathy for her victims. They don't seem to see how dangerous she is even when she mauls her first victim.Only until she rips the throat out of the second doctor do they realize that she might not be stable. Really? It took two victims and a deer before they realized this? And what's with the hoodie? Perhaps if we saw Morgan growing up in her environment as we saw in the beginning of other femme-fatale movies then we would care for her plight. However, her coldness and lack of character makes for two hours we'll never get back.",Morgan
170,talcomx,Things wrong with this film:,4,6 May 2020,"Ill just write out everything that is wrong with the film. If you see these as non-issues then by all means enjoy the movie~Actual Plot: SynTech sends out a fixer from risk management to evaluate and clean up when an android attacks one of the scientist care-takers.(the name is only said in the film, never written out for you. I spelled it this way for Synthetic and Technology though it could be SinTech because they are 'playing god' if you will by trying to create synthetic life) ...Issues i found with the film:1) the scientists: theyre not very scientisty. theyre in love with the android. they arent shown becoming attached to the synthetic as it grows other than ONE of them and shes a behaviorist so that would be the obvious pick. this is their 'first success' but they for whatever reason treat this droid like the golden child when according to their science they figured it out and should be able to reproduce this outcome infinitely, making the droid even less significant and important i.e. no reason to not be detached enough to not get murdered.2) the risk management / clean up detail: she doesnt fit the part. her dialogue is fine, but her actions dont really reflect her objective. the film tries to hide the truth from you but does it in a way that seems obvious and as a result pretty much screams out what is going to happen far too early. Why does she need a gun if all she is there to do is evaluate and make a recommendation?? Yes there was an incident but the incident didnt in any way imply a lack of security and safety.. which was compounded by the fact that the synth was contained in an enclosure and had not tried to escape.3) the synthetic. why is she always wearing that stupid hood. why did they make her look fake when she was actually more human / organic than not. they just tricked an egg into thinking it was fertilized which still would have meant real skin etc. why was she so lame in combat despite being 'weaponized'? the film only tells you she has 'weaponized protocol' after she starts killing people. they try to focus on the droids humanity but its a weapon but they dress and treat her like she is not human. there is a conflict here with 'it has a soul' and 'its obviously being treated as not having a soul, which you can see in how they treat it'. had she wore normal clothes and had a more normal looking living quarters the attachment to her by the scientists might have been more believable rather than the drab 5 year old wool hoodie and concrete everything-else. also, shes killing everyone for keeping her like a 'thing' despite her having free access to roam about prior to the incident. meaning, the people she is killing never really did anything wrong to her, she didnt hate them, and when they did confine her she had already hurt someone. the one person she didnt try to kill didnt do anything more or less bad or good to her than anyone else. and in fact, you dont even see the affection from that character to that degree, while you do see it from others who she is quick to exterminate. very contradictory.4) objective. did the film want to be a deep thought scifi or an action film? it couldnt decide and fails at being either. it tries to ask a few deep questions, or present ideas in a complex and thought provoking way but then tramples all over that with bad choices by characters, lack of motive of key players.tldr:in closing, it felt like someone who doesnt watch or read a lot of sci-fi had an idea and tried dipping their toes in, but the water was colder than they thought so despite going knee deep never actually jumped in fully. the action sequences are kinda wack. the android goes from loved child to murder droid without any semblance of motive, and it makes even less sense because youre given a scene that heavily implies mercy and compassion yet just feeds the confusion later when the droid kills those that do obviously care about her and see her as more than a science project. and then, to finish it off, a cliche ending plot twist when the incompetent fixer decides to man up and take action.too predictable, not fleshed out well, and poor character design.",Morgan

As if that was the point of this movie, only about AI. Well, it was and it wasn't. I also see a lot of people stating how bland Kate Mara was in this movie, as if she cannot act. I think you need to watch this title again, because her acting is based of the character she was playing. The writers and the directors showed their hands, more than once, on what Lee Weathers is (played by Kate Mara). So, if you do not want to watch the entire movie again, I get it, just watch the last 5 minutes of it again. Especially the part where she (Lee Weathers), is sitting in the dinner all by herself and corporate is discussing her. So, yes it is about AI, but the twist of who or what Lee Weathers REALLY is, that is what you did not see. I liked this movie, I found it to have many layers to it. The writer did not want to make another Ex-Machina, and I actually like both of them.

It shows that when there is anything more pure than a human, all the human can do is murder it, and turn it into a murderer themselves. If possible I would wash my hands completely of all humans because being forced to participate with them is frankly just exhausting.

Which doesn't mean, that everything was worth those stars. I will try to break it down a bit, so stay with me.Directing: Luke does a good job on this end of the movie. Everything is good. Not outstanding, but good. Picture, light, cut. Everything is how it should be. Easily 7 stars, but not more.Score: A score is very important to me in a movie and it's OK on this one. Exception is the final song of the movie ""Very cruel"" by Polica, which is hitting the nail on the head. Should have been IN the movie and not at the end.Effects: As far as effects are included, they are good.Acting: I think, Anya Taylor-Joy did a great job on this one. I could connect very well to the character she presented. All other actors did a good job as well, but nothing special. Only Rose Leslie was shining a bit brighter.Story: So, here is the problem of the movie. Everything is good and maybe even very good aside from the story. The idea is OK and all in all watchable and entertaining, but the plot holes and logical mistakes... damn! At various points, the characters say or do thinks, that confuses you, because they are ""professionals"" and Morgan is supposed to be so above average,that I kept waiting for anything, that would prove that. Nothing. But it got worse and worse toward the end of the movie. As entertaining and very good the choreography is and as good as it was filmed, the logic died in the final fight scene. TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE! I was shocked, but HEY! That's me. See for yourself.Overall: I REALLY enjoyed Morgan. The actors, the atmosphere, the pictures, fight scenes. All very good. Just the God damned plot holes, unanswered questions and totally stupid behaviors at some points.... really sucked.

183,mbutin-1,Good God this movie made me depressed (Spoiler Alert),3,10 September 2016,"Warning I will be talking about spoilers so feel free to skip if you don't want to know.I really enjoyed this movie despite it being 2nd rated compare to Ex-Machina. The story they were developing for the Character Morgan really touched me. I was very into how she was shown in the movie. It was depressing, I never had a smile on my face, but I felt for her especially when they went to the Lake and she felt at peace from all the hate and rage and killing she unfortunately commuted. I knew something was going to happen to her and she wasn't going to live at the end, but the way they chose to do it was by far the worse thing they could've done.Kate Mara, I swear I try to like her, but just like in Transcendence, I couldn't tolerate her. I wanted her to die in this movie (her character of course lol) And the way she was being man-handled by Morgan most of the time in this movie, from falling off 2nd story mansion, from getting into a car wreck, from getting pierced by a tree branch. She still all of a sudden has the strength to continue? When Morgan is suppose to be an advance version of her? And Morgan can't even fight out of being drowned by her? I'm making too big a deal about this but I can't stand the fact that after all that build up for Morgan, all that time she escaped death, and that's how Luke Scott thought was the best idea to kill her? By being drowned by a damaged Li? I know Morgan is suppose to be the antagonist, but Luke screwed the pooch and only made Mara look like the evil woman in this film. If Morgan was going to die in this movie, she deserved better.Never in my life would I ever think after ""The Counselor"" I would walk out of a movie theater and feel completely depressed about a character in the movie. Well Luke Scott proved me wrong on that part. I pray in my own selfish desire that a sequel can be made one day where Morgan wakes up from her death and seeks revenge against Li, because Morgan character was way too built up to end like that.

It has everything to do with the subject, but has its own merit...to the end. Yes some concessions have to be made (don't they always), but none too hard for me. For instance, character development. Little existed because little was needed. Each character was either a known actor (needing less introduction) or stereotypically unique to the cast; letting them stand alone and be quickly evaluated.This does have the ecosystem qualities, female leads, and similar allure as Ex-Machina, but it's distinctly different. As many more of these films continue to surface in the coming months and years, we all will continue to grapple with the ethics and potential consequences.

The actors are never called on to perform anything beyond the barest notes of orchestrated emotion. It's sad given the caliber of talent brought to this project.The saddest moment is the reveal.

Just vague ones. Main complain is this is a government sponsored experiment to create a perfect killing machine to use as a weapon and then we and the people in the movie are supposed to be surprised when it starts to kill people. That and nothing much really happens in the move. Girl kills, they decide to kill it, its friends help it escape, it kills them while escaping just because, it gets hunted down and killed.

I appreciated the small amount of cast members, they all brought a lot to the movie, but nothing about the movie was confusing. It made it easy to find someone to relate to. The movie started with action, and then immediately slows down and allows the audience to relate to the characters on a emotional level. Then picks back up towards the middle/end and it was just fabulous, and loved how it slowly brought out the truths in the movie. The actor who plays Morgan is simply beautiful & did a fabulous job making the audience believe she was just an innocent science experiment.

However, this is just my personal take when I saw this film.Without going into too much detail about what this film entails, I felt as though there were a few moments in the film which could have been better.1/ The ending was slightly disappointing... and for those who do not understand why then I am sure it will become clear in the end. I just expected more.2/ I felt as though more connection was needed between Morgan and the audience. I found the clips of her as a child sweet and warming. I even felt sympathy towards her after she had attacked her first and second victims. However, in the end I felt as though I lacked sympathy for her character, after she became more and more out of hand. This also ties into the first point to do with the ending. I was expecting to be moved, riveted. But instead I felt a mixture of ""Really... after all that, that's how it ended?"", along with a sense of the lack of what I felt was emotion. 3/ I wanted to understand more about why and how the members of staff loved her so much. OK, she was special - but why did they love her the way they did, even after it became clear that she was starting to become dangerous? Why didn't one of them even question themselves over how out of hand things were getting?Just a couple of points.

I think the subject matter can be easily dismissed by a general audience because of the biological focus in this movie. By that I mean the nurturing aspect that was displayed by some of the employees towards Morgan.

She's basically good at every role I've ever seen her in regardless of whether she in a supporting role or lead.While I was able to figure out pretty much from the beginning how the plot would go, this was by no means a detraction from seeing how the plot played out. The acting was excellent from all cast members.As previously stated in other reviews, the movie does require some active thought on behalf of the viewer, an intelligent movie as it were. It's been a while since I enjoyed a movie like I enjoyed this one!",Morgan
198,tamiacraft,What a Sweet Birthday Gift,7,23 June 2017,"My sister and I watched this movie after it premiered on Max, and we were both mildly entertained. My sister mentioned this reminded her of ""Splice,"" and I agreed, but to me this is a little better with no sex scenes. On the other hand, if you're interested in action packed, guns blazing, fast paced sci-fi with a bit of romance and lots of anus kicking, then do not watch this.This movie is a slow burn. Although, I adore slow burns in indie films because it allows the viewers to connect with the characters, analyze the story. But, ""Morgan,"" moves at an unnecessary snail's pace. There is a twist though, the ending is vague and abrupt, but once the unknown mystery is solved you'll probably be shocked. However, throughout the film, I found myself waiting for Morgan to escape or do something spectacular with her genetically engineered superpowers. And it never happened.Listen if you are digging the sci-fi genre, and are itching to watch a movie with an invisible genetically modified five-year-old like me then be my guest. Buy it, rent it, watch it. But if you want to see a thrilling sci-fi flick that leaves you dangling off the edge of your coach then go find another movie because this isn't for you.For me it was good. What is it predictable? Yes, but a round of applause goes to the actors for making the scenes believable.",Morgan
199,facebook_responses,Only one mention of the source for this story?,5,28 July 2017,"Why is there only one mention, in the first three pages of these MORGAN reviews, of Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, the obvious source for this retelling of her classic story? Are these reviewers all so ingenuous that they are completely ignorant of the original story, or of the earlier films based on the story; all they can allude to are other recent films with similar story lines. This story has an old, old pedigree.MORGAN is just another take on Frankenstein's monster, without any of the substance or density of Mary Shelley, but with some well-paced direction and engaging performances, if cold is your dish. That Lee was an android of some sort was clear all too soon - Scott must have not given Mara any wriggle-room at all. When Morgan flies off her leash, the plot's derivation becomes obvious and we pass the rest of the film vainly waiting for intelligent parallels. The music was effective.",Morgan
