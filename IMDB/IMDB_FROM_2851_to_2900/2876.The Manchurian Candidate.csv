0,TheLittleSongbird,Stylishly shot and decently acted but dull and convoluted,5,31 December 2010,"In brief comparison, I adore the 1962 film and consider it one of the best of the 60s. This remake is far from the worst remake in existence(the remake to Psycho should never have been made) plus it does have its good points. The film is well made with stylish cinematography and striking locations. The acting is above decent, Denzel Washington does well filling Frank Sinatra's shoes, Liev Schreiber literally sinks his teeth into his role and Meryl Streep does make an impression as Schreiber's unscrupulous mother. The film does also try hard to evoke a chilling atmosphere and does succeed at times. However, Jonathan Demme's direction lacks subtlety and control. Also the script is pretty weak coming across as hackneyed, the story is extremely complex and too convoluted and the film drags making the (just over) 2 hour film rather dull. All in all, not bad but disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox",The Manchurian Candidate
1,Leofwine_draca,"Effective, compelling conspiracy story",7,22 June 2012,"Although I've not seen the '60s original on which this remake is based, I respect and trust Denzel Washington as an actor, which was enough for me to check it out when it showed up on TV late one night. I'm glad I did: THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a surprisingly thoughtful conspiracy thriller that gets most things right.Washington headlines a superior cast, playing a retired army captain who suspects that something strange happened to both him and his squad of soldiers when they were fighting in Iraq back in the day. Much of his uneasiness is forced around presidential candidate Liev Schreiber (who underplays to strong effect). As he finds himself besought by headaches and unnerving flashbacks, Washington commits himself on a path to finding out the truth.For the most part, Jonathan Demme's movie sidesteps cliché and instead focuses on strong and effective storytelling. He elicits some decent performances from his cast, too; Washington is unsurprisingly strong, but it's especially refreshing to see Meryl Streep not playing the usual character she plays in movies. Jeffrey Wright contributes a neat, twitchy cameo, and watch out for DOWNFALL's Bruno Ganz as Washington's aide.The film moves along at a good pace and offers plenty of drama along the way. It genuinely surprised me with twists that I never saw coming, and half the fun was trying to work out how they'd end things. Let's just say that the finish doesn't disappoint. This thriller delivers the goods and is well worth checking out.",The Manchurian Candidate
2,SnoopyStyle,great actors in effective remake,7,2 April 2016,"Captain Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) leads an unit during Desert Storm that gets ambushed. Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) is not particularly liked by the men but he becomes the hero who saves the unit. Corp. Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) comes to Marco with disturbing dreams. Marco also has the same dream and starts to investigate what really happened during the incident. The hero Shaw is pushed by his overbearing Senator mother Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep) to become the VP nominee over rival Senator Tom Jordan (Jon Voight).I like this a little bit more than the original. I like the premise in this one but it's still outlandish. The acting is superior. Schreiber has a creepiness and Washington is a pure leading man. Meryl Streep is amazing as a stage-mom monster. I still have a problem with the premise. Also there is no surprise since it's a remake. Nevertheless, this is an effective remake.",The Manchurian Candidate
3,Hitchcoc,Doesn't Make It,5,13 October 2010,"With all the extra bells and whistles and all the possibilities, it's kind of sad that this just doesn't work very well. Once we go off into science fiction mode, an implanted device that allows the bad guys to control brains, instead of a calculated brainwashing effort by a foreign power, it all shuts down. Denzel Washington has been victimized along with his fellow soldiers. The cold-fish hero of a fiery battle, returns to civilian life, and with the aid of his overzealous mother, becomes a prim presidential candidate. It just doesn't wash. There are so many questionable events. Washington's character becomes a thorn in the side of everyone, but they seem intent on letting him live while others are gotten rid of. I suppose we shouldn't compare films, but the pacing and intensity of the original is missing here. I won't spoil the ending, but I found it utterly ludicrous. Thanks to John Frankenheimer for doing it right.",The Manchurian Candidate
4,claudio_carvalho,Prefer the Classic  Jonathan Demme Prefers to Follow the Easiest Way Trying to Reach Success,6,12 October 2005,"John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is certainly among the best movies of the cinema history, inclusive is rated in IMDb top 250 as #75. This remake is not totally bad, but why remakes such a classic? It seems that former great director Jonathan Demme presently prefers to follow the easiest way trying to reach success instead of risking, but with terrible results. In 2002, he made an awful and ridiculous version of ""Charade"" with the mediocre ""The Truth About Charlie"". In 2004, he decided to insult John Frankenheimer with this complicated and totally absurd and unbelievable version of the classic. My vote is six just because I am a great fan of Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep.Title (Brazil): ""Sob o Domínio do Mal"" (""Under the Domination of the Evil"")",The Manchurian Candidate
5,classicsoncall,"""I believe democracy is not negotiable.""",8,13 August 2021,"This remake of the 1962 original diverges more from that picture's story line than it does to emulate it. In keeping with the tenor of the times, it's no longer a foreign power that engages in brainwashing techniques, but a multi-national corporation with the unlikely name of Manchurian Global. Personally, I'd be wary of doing business with a company with a name like that, it just smacks of foreign intervention and manipulation. It's also not clear what Manchurian Global's end game was with the hypnosis techniques and the implants. In Frank Sinatra's version, it was the Chinese who utilized sophisticated brainwashing methods to get inside the heads of their targets, and it didn't take much of a stretch to understand that a foreign enemy intended to exert their influence in American politics. But what would a multi-national gain in the scenario developed here? The main thrust of pushing Raymond Shaw
(Liev Schreiber) for a spot on the Presidential ticket appeared to be a concession to Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep), who's ambitions for the Presidency failed when her Senator husband died twenty years prior. In that regard, the character of Eleanor Shaw was every bit as manipulative as that of Angela Lansbury in the same role in the earlier version, right down to that borderline incestuous kiss given her son. That creeped me out both then and now.It's been a long time since I watched and reviewed ""The Manchurian Candidate"" of the Sixties, but it seems to me that the tension and suspense was greater in the original picture. It was certainly more of a political thriller than it's successor for reasons mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, the performances of the principals was outstanding, even if the motivations of Manchurian Global were suspect. I found it interesting that this film was co-produced by Tina Sinatra who inherited the production rights from her father. What Frank would have thought about the movie is anybody's guess.",The Manchurian Candidate
6,gavin6942,A Big Remake,7,23 May 2017,"In the midst of the Gulf War, soldiers are kidnapped and brainwashed for sinister purposes.As with any remake, it is more or less impossible to live up to the original. Even here, with plenty of major stars, a bigger budget and an Oscar-winning director, it would be wrong to say this is better than the original. Maybe as good, though that is doubtful. Certainly not better.Updating the plot from Korea to Iraq makes sense and is a wise move. I am not as thrilled about the science fiction aspects. My memory (though it may be faulty) recalls the original being mostly brainwashing and triggers. It does not recall any actual removal of brains and wildly futuristic surgery. This, to me, takes away from the film, and especially because it is revealed so early on (within ten minutes).",The Manchurian Candidate
7,lee_eisenberg,"At one point, we're all the bad guys...",6,8 July 2005,"When the ""Manchurian Candidate"" remake came out, it got mixed reviews; most people were wondering why anyone would remake a movie like ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Well, the result actually wasn't all that bad. Naturally, they had to change a few things to update it. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) led a platoon in the Gulf War, which included Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), the son of Sen. Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep). Then, Marco learns that something sordid happened while he was commanding the platoon, and of course, no one believes him.Why did they remake ""The Manchurian Candidate""? Well, the original was a product of the Cold War, and this one is a product of...no, not the War on Terrorism, but rather the suspicion of corporate power. Granted, most corporations have done little or nothing to merit our trust, but how many movies can there be where some bizarre corporation is the bad guy? No matter, the movie does make us question our common assumptions about whom we can trust. Meryl Streep's senator is pretty much as ruthless as we might expect any politician to be (not that hers is the only unpleasant politico; Jon Voight's Tom Jordan isn't particularly desirable himself).Overall, this version isn't as suspenseful as the original, maybe because we already know what happens. Assuming that anyone reading this has already seen the original, I don't have to tell you what happens. But the movie does remind us of something: in this day and age, we unfortunately can't be as independent as we would like to imagine.",The Manchurian Candidate
8,jboothmillard,The Manchurian Candidate,7,23 September 2007,"From director Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs), this remake of the Frank Sinatra classic is pretty good, they have only changed the time period. Basically, during the Gulf war and an ambush, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Scream's Liev Schreiber) saved his fellow soldiers, just like commanding officer, Bennett ""Ben"" Marco (Denzel Washington), who was then knocked unconscious. Telling this story to the press, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, and eventually, with insistence from his demanding mother Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is made vice-presidential nominee. Marco meanwhile is being haunted by dreams of what probably happened when he was unconscious in Kuwait. As (now Major) Marco investigates, he searches for the truth, he gets to the point where he wonders if it happened at all. He thinks that the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed with special microchips of some kind to believe Shaw did all those things he claims as a war hero, as part of a plot to seize the White House. The people behind it, in the Manchurian Global corporation, including Atticus Noyle (Simon McBurney) appear desperate to stop him finding out and ruining their plan. Also starring Jon Voight as Senator Thomas Jordan, Kimberly Elise as Rosie, Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Al Melvin, Ted Levine as Colonel Howard, Downfall's Bruno Ganz as Richard Delp, Miguel Ferrer as Colonel Garret, Dean Stockwell as Mark Whiting, Vera Farmiga as Jocelyne Jordan, Zeljko Ivanek as Vaughn Utly, Roger Corman as Mr. Secretary, Charles Napier as General Sloan and Bill Irwin as Scoutmaster. There are some great moments of confrontation (especially using point of view shots), and Streep is a perfect bitch woman you probably wouldn't think was part of the scheme. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Denzel Washington number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Washington was number 40, and Streep number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",The Manchurian Candidate
9,rmax304823,Politics as Usual.,6,6 December 2005,"Richard Condon's novel has its infelicities. The author can suddenly lapse into baby talk. (""Raymond was his mamma's widdle boy."") But he packed his novel with jokes too and was in many ways pretty funny.The 1962 version followed the novel rather closely and kept its plot clear and no more cluttered than necessary to its comprehension.This version is longer than the original and is a considerable departure from Condon's story. Gone is the Cold War background, which is too bad because it contained a neat twist. The Commies are going to take over the country by posing as super-patriotic Right Wingers. Well, that's out now. The title no longer refers to a place but to a corporation -- ""Manchurian Global"" -- and the corporation is all evil and lacks cleverness. The values they espouse sound like they came out of Reader's Digest. ""A grandmother shouldn't have to choose between paying for her medicine and paying for her dinner."" Platitudes float around during interviews like neon-blue balloons at a political convention. They could have come directly from recent speeches by one of our leading politicians who once announced: ""This is a nation that loves its freedom. Loves its country."" I kind of miss the irony of the original story.Something else too. I followed the novel easily. I also followed the 1962 version with no problem. A squad of American troops are led astray by their Korean interpreter, are captured by the Chinese, and taken to Manchuria where for three days their brains are not merely washed but dry cleaned. Especially Raymond Shaw (Lawrence Harvey in 1962) who is given the treatment full blast and planted as an assassin mole in the U. S. The other men in the unit are a bit less warped and the brain washing memory is not quite obliterated. It expresses itself in nightmares. Finally, Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) figures out what's going on and foils the Commies' plot by undoing the rewired brain of Raymond Shaw.In this version, the brainwashing is done away with and replaced by high-tech devices that we cannot understand. And instead of getting the deluxe brainwashing treatment, Raymond Shaw (Schreiber) has a chip implanted in his brain, along with another in his shoulder. Evidently the other surviving members of his squad also have chips in their shoulders but not in their heads. Or so I thought.Throughout, Raymond is the only one who seems programmed to respond to commands after hearing a verbal trigger which puts him into a compliant trance state. But somewhere along the way Major Marco (Washington) may have acquired one too because near the end he too responds to the trigger phrase. I missed the first few minutes and that may account for my confusion.Still, this version, while enjoyable on its own, isn't up to the original. It's in color and it's louder and it's bloodier but it lacks the cohesiveness of the 1962 version. I don't want to give too many examples, but take the relationship between Raymond and Jocie, the girl friend he is forced to murder. In the original, he is an arrogant skunk, but she is the love of his life -- the only love he is capable of because he's been warped by smotherly love -- and Jocie adores Raymond. She humanizes him. They are married and shortly he shoots her.In this version -- and I have no idea why this change was made -- Raymond once dated Jocie and still has a crush on her 15 years later but she is dismissive of their earlier relationship and more or less tells him to get it behind him. So when he is forced to murder her, it is not a tragedy, not the death of the only thing he has ever loved enough to be human with, but rather an unfortunate accident. You know -- ""too bad"".Likewise this version compares unfavorably to the original with respect to the character of Major Marco -- Sinatra there, Washington here. Sinatra was never a bravura actor but he does a good job of conveying Marco's steady decline into neurological shambles because of his recurring nightmares. He drinks, he sweats, he shakes, he reads -- he reads everything. He has a friend in San Francisco who ships him books by the pound, picked at random. Everything from ""Diseases of Horses"" through ""Principles of Modern Banking"" to ""Ethnic Choices of the Arabs."" The scene on the train in which Sinatra meets Janet Leigh while he disintegrates under her intense and curious stare (he fumbles a cigarette and it plops into his drink) is memorable, as is the elliptical conversation which follows.In this version, Washington is seated on a train and a young woman across from him strikes up a perfectly normal conversation. In the middle of it, he excuses himself, gets up and goes to the men's room and vomits. That's it. It's bland and unimaginative. Washington is a fine actor but he does not ""do"" an anxiety attack very well, possibly because the script gives him no chance.The script leaves out other incidents that are hardly unimportant ones. In the original (1962, mind you) the incestuous relationship between Raymond and his mother is made explicit. Angela Lansbury as the mother (who was in reality about Harvey's own age) plants a big smooch on him before the fade. Here, the corresponding scene ends with Meryl Streep staring with what appears to be an expression of concern up at Liev Schreiber's hypnotized face. It's an added dramatic thread in the story that the new version more or less ignores.I won't go on about it. This version is pretty good, but it does lack the irony, humor, and utter quirkiness of the novel and the 1962 movie.",The Manchurian Candidate

11,dbdumonteil,puppeteer 2,7,6 June 2006,"1962. That year, John Frankenheimer arrives without warning in the landscape of American cinema and makes a name of himself with two magnum opus: ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" and especially ""the Mandchurian Candidate"". The latter, perhaps one of the momentous works in the history of American cinema related a plot commanded from abroad which targeted to kill a candidate for the USA presidency and replace him with a puppet candidate wholly manipulated by his mother. Raymond Shaw, a hero (?) of the Corean war was the instrument of the plot. This was a ground-breaking classic which heralded the genre of the political thriller. It had its decade glory in the seventies with works like ""the Parallax View"" (1974) by Alan J. Pakula (the ending is clearly inspired by the end of ""the Mandchurian Candidate""). So, to contemplate a remake of such a film which was not evident to make in the first place and was also a zeitgeist of the common fears of its time was almost an unthinkable thing. Moreover, these last years, the Hollywood industry seems to go through a block and opts for overbid to compensate it by multiplying adaptations of comic strips, TV series turned into films and the inevitable remakes. Here, against all odds, Jonathan Demme turned this product which smelled the commission at his own advantage.Okay, this remake is a few notches below Frankenheimer's masterpiece which encompassed admirable sequences like Raymond Shaw's murder of his father-in-law and his fiancée. In these sequences, Frankenheimer's camera work (rightly lauded) worked wonders. So, Demme could with difficulty reproduce the brilliance of these sequences. The one mentioned above takes a lake as a backdrop instead of a house and is at best well shot. In another extent, the hypnotist power exercised on Shaw was suggested in a more subtle way in the original film since, the puppet just had to see a precise playing card to lead him to commit his wrongdoings. Here, it's a little hard to swallow that Shaw just has to hear his name on a solemn tone to be guided. Also, a little negative is this little reductive, minimalist side of the story: Denzel Washington is alone against everybody and has trouble to find someone and to convince him that Shaw is entirely manipulated by his surroundings at the American elections for the vice-presidency.But what remains shouldn't be dismissed at all and is thoroughly gratifying. Obviously, the die-hard fans of the original film (I rank among them) will be tempted to make comparisons and to enumerate changes. They don't act in the detriment of Demme's work. On the contrary, the authors shrewdly transposed the extravagant story in our era with necessary changes which prove to be neat. Hence, a modernized version. So, the first Iraq war superseded the Korean war, good idea indeed. Then, the fear of communism which reigned among the majority of the American electorate left the ground for rather the fear of political bribery. Moreover, the innovations and novelties as regards technology could only lend themselves to the extravagance and the updating of the topic and serve it. Bennet Marco searches on the Internet the members of the Mandchurian Global and unearths their shameful pasts. The firm implanted chips in the skins of the brainwashed soldiers and more telling, just see the scene in which Shaw is operated for his head. Besides, one of the most crucial changes in the recycling of the plot is its origin. More precisely, the one responsible who pull the strings and seem to act only for their peculiar interests. Demme, also probably for the respect for the audience's sake simplified the story. In Frankenheimer's film, it was Angela Lansbury's husband who was the candidate. Here, why not Raymond Shaw himself? Clarifying it was also among the filmmakers' concerns and it is eloquent to mention again Marco's research on the Internet. The amount? These alterations help to fuel better the paranoid aura which shrouds the film and Demme treats his directing and his scenario with enough insistence so that the audience won't lose the thread of a convoluted and meandering story.The director also had flair for the cast which adds to the little success of this remake. Meryl Streep, one of the biggest American actresses resumes Lansbury's part with as much monstrosity as her model and perhaps more (in one scene, she hugs her son). Denzel Washington is Frank Sinatra's worthy heir and bestows to Marco's persona more fragility and vulnerability than the singer. Liev Treiber is as mind-boggling as Laurence Harvey and the rest of the cast isn't sacrificed at all.The purists of the 1962 film will maybe complain about this updated and clarified as much as possible rereading. This remake is as far-fetched as its father which was also so but is eminently watchable because the authors had the intelligence to adapt the bulk of its story and its components to the customs, mentalities and major concerns in the outset of the twentieth-first century. Like forty years ago, the film has echoes with some current events and makes us ask the same questions, including this one: could it happen in the real life? Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction. And it is Demme's best effort since the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991).",The Manchurian Candidate
12,Quinoa1984,a remake that works,7,24 May 2006,"Jonathan Demme is a smarter director than some might credit him for. Many would just place him as the Silence of the Lambs guy, forgetting his career making satires and other dark comedies or on-the-edge films in the 1980's. The Manchurian Candidate is Demme's second remake after Charade's the Truth About Charlie, and this time he gets it a bit more right. Instead of an outright homage, here Demme is careful with his casting choices so that there isn't a slip-up, and even the points that aren't strong still have moments where one invests in the characters because of the people playing them. It's further interesting that the storyline- of a corporation (Manchurian global) can take the place of what the Manchurian Candidate of 1962 stood for without too much compromise. If there is anything more commendable about a film that takes a minor leap off of the original its when there is a style that works to suit the more modernized material. This is simply one of those cases where the remake isn't a throwaway, but works on its own as a timely thriller-cum-satire where the themes of brainwashing, political control, and plight of the usually solid military and government holds strong in this 21st century where everything's controlled by 5 or 6 corporations.Denzel Washington- who apparently did not watch the original film- is splendid in the Frank Sinatra role as an ex-officer who should have more of a memory than he does of Desert Storm, but his old Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, good in the Laurence Harvey role) may not even know everything too, even as he gets groomed for a high political positing by his mother (Meryl Streep, very close to the greatness of the Lansbury role), and possibly other elements. There is a sub-lot with Washington and a possible romance, but anything for his character is in trouble in the realm of memories of what may or may not have occurred, and how this draws him into secrets of the Manchurian corporation so deep that it will lead him into something very dark. To say much more about the story would be moot; Demme is in a way more interested by the characters here, particularly those of Shaw and Ben Marco, how they both have these dark suspicions, with one growing and one qualm ed by a certain word spoken by Mrs. Shaw. And these brainwashing scenes are some of the best I've seen in any Demme film, as the screws are turned sharp on Demme's style and what is very dangerous and just outright deranged is shown with a certain bravura that had me captivated.The perks of the film don't make it great, though, there is a certain lack of involvement in Washington's sub-plot with the woman, even as it is still good storytelling wise. And the climax and how it is reached is a let-down when compared to the virtuoso sequence in Frankenheimer's original. But if you are going into this having not seen the original it's not a case of feeling left out of what you might be missing from the original. On its own legs its an intelligent kind of political thriller that has some barbs to poke at the current media and certain possible political figures. (strong) B+",The Manchurian Candidate
13,wes-connors,This Is What Is Known as a Stacked Deck,5,8 August 2010,"This re-make, or updating of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962) is much different than the original. The change in setting is most obvious, as here we have the more modern war in Iraq replacing the 1950s Korean War. Also, the classic qualities in the earlier film - best represented by John Frankenheimer's marvelously directed dream sequences, the quirky conversational dialogue, and the surreal ""solitaire"" card-playing - is all gone. And, oddly enough, this is a good thing because filmmakers are not attempting to re-do what made the original an accidental masterpiece; so, in that respect, this is an honest endeavor.Unfortunately, this film removes much of the original works' (book and movie) political bite; they may have been subtle, but were not shy. Despite being accused of anti-Republicanism, this film identifies no party by name. Apparently, the suits were hoping to straddle, lest offending anyone. Moreover, manipulative Meryl Streep (as Eleanor Prentiss Shaw) seems to be channeling Hillary Rodham Clinton (she has unconvincingly denied this, citing more Conservative reference points). The new story holds back, and is more obvious than oblique. The production, performances, and change in villainy are okay.***** The Manchurian Candidate (7/22/04) Jonathan Demme ~ Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, Meryl Streep, Kimberly Elise",The Manchurian Candidate

Shaw, the son of powerful congresswoman Eleanor Shaw, has used his reputation as a war hero to quickly scale the ladder of American politics, and with the help of his mother earns the Vice Presidential nomination. Marco, on the other hand, has been troubled with mental illness, and is convinced that something strange happened to him and his compatriots during the war. As Marco struggles to find the truth behind his nightmares and emotional torment, he unearths some disturbing facts about how his mind and body have been reworked by shadowy forces, as well as those of his fellow soldiers that includes Shaw.While it is not the classic its predecessor is, this remake is well- acted and conjures a chilling resonance.This humorless and nonsensical version is never quite engages, devolving the original's camp and satire into self-serious melodrama and it never approaches that level of intensity, intelligence, or audacity unlike the original.But nevertheless,it remains watchable due to great performances of the talented cast.",The Manchurian Candidate
16,jotix100,Momma's boy,7,10 April 2005,"Ted Demme took a big chance in the remaking of this version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"". The 2004 take on the Richard Condon's novel feels so different from the original that it pales in comparison. Mr. Demme seems to have gone for more action than we had in the 1962 John Frankenheimer version. In trying to get away from George Axelrod's screen play, Mr. Demme has imbued the film with paranoia.The best excuse to watch this 2004 version is the acting. Liev Schreiber is magnificent in his portrayal of Raymond Shaw. Mr. Schreiber proves, as though he needed to do so, that he is one of the best actors working on stage and films these days. He runs away with the film.The other notable appearance is by Meryl Streep as the cunning Eleonor Shaw, Raymond's mother. Unfortunately she is not seen enough in the film. This is the role that Angela Lansbury created. Ms. Streep's interpretation of Eleanor is completely different from Ms. Lanbury's own Mrs. Iselin.Denzel Washington, as Ben Marco, is excellent. He shows an intensity and a resolution that Frank Sinatra didn't show. Of course, these are two actors that are as different as day and night. Mr. Washington gives another good performance.The multi talented cast is amazing. There are too many to single out anyone in particular as they all made an invaluable contribution to the finished product. Unfortunately, since the original film is a classic by itself, it didn't need a remake because that 1962 film was the definite version.",The Manchurian Candidate
17,preppy-3,Pointless remake,1,31 July 2004,"Yet another sad example of Hollywood remaking a classic film for no good reason.Something happened during the Gulf War in 1991--a squadron of men were ambushed--two died but the others were saved by Shaw (Leiv Schreiber).  Fast forward to 2004--Shaw along with his incredibly cruel, domineering mother (Meryl Streep) is about the become vice-president.  But his former army buddies are having harrowing nightmares about something that may have happened during the ambush and that Shaw may be very, very dangerous...There was no reason to remake the 1962 classic at all.  I wasn't going to see it but critics have been falling all over themselves praising this movie and saying it is NOT a remake.  I don't know what movie they saw, but the one I did WAS an updating of the original with the same basic plot.  There are a few changes of characters and such but, all in all, it was just a rehash.I was totally bored because I knew the plot already--none of the twists and turns surprised me.  Also it was loud and kept hammering the audience over the head with the parinoa angle.  Acting doesn't really help.  Schreiber is OK (but won't make you forget Laurence Harvey).  Denzel Washington gives a rare bad performance reprising the Frank Sinatra role.  Meryl Streep tries but is nowhere near as good as Angela Landsbury was.  The only improvement was Kimberly Elise who was given something to do with Janet Leigh's pointless role in the original.Boring, needless, a total waste of time.  I hope this movie bombs!  The only good thing it might do is convince people to see the superior original.  I give it a 1.",The Manchurian Candidate
18,LeonLouisRicci,Creepy Modern UpdateRelevant and Slightly Underrated,7,13 April 2016,"Tweaked and Tailored for Moderns, this is a Remake/Update from Director Jonathan Demme of the John Frankenheimer Original (1962), that is mostly considered a Masterpiece. Communism is Replaced with Corporatism and Brain and Body Implants are Added to the Mind Control Element.This one has a Great Cast and the Director's Flourishes are Viscerally Creepy. The Original got Inside Your Head and the Remake gets Inside Your Head and Body. Denzel Washington comes almost Unglued but manages to straddle the line between Dream and Reality and keep hold of the Character's Disabilities that keeps the Audience Centered and Attached to the Story.It was a Topical Political Thriller in 2004 and Viewed Today may seem Even More Insightful. It didn't go Deep Enough for some at the Time and went so Deep as to be Lost in the Abyss for others. You Decide, because it is a Divisive Film but Entertaining nonetheless. The Ending is a bit Confusing and Weak, but Overall the Movie is Worth a Watch for its Watchful Eye focusing on a Modern Political Landscape and a Thesis that has become even More Relevant in 2016.",The Manchurian Candidate
19,Boba_Fett1138,Highly unbelievable thriller.,6,14 February 2006,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" is one of those movies that had lots of potential but in the ending it all falls flat. Of course it can't hold a candle to the original version from 1962 but also on its own this movie is a disappointing one that is highly unbelievable to watch.Problem with the movie is that it never does succeed in creating the right mood and setting the correct atmosphere and tone. The thriller and supernatural-thriller elements of the movie don't blend in with each other. The movie is meant to be realistic but the supernatural-thriller elements of the movie are weird and not very well constructed in the story. That makes the movie an highly unlikely and unbelievable one, perhaps even a silly one at times. Also the confusing plot contributes to this. Lot's of subplot-lines are abandoned halfway through the movie and the movie in the long run provides more questions than answers. It makes the movie a very unsatisfying one to watch. Also the movie is dragging at points when the movie and story don't really seem to go anywhere. There are lots of characters in the movie but quite a few could had been left out to avoid confusion. The movie never really becomes tense or mysterious and could had really used a paranoid sort of atmosphere to add some more to the tension and atmosphere of the movie.The movie is simply not very well constructed and the style is severely lacking. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fine but it really is the bleak directing by Jonathan Demme that kills the movie. Guess he just wasn't the right man for the job because we all know that Demme is capable of making some good movies like he showed previous to this movie with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Philadelphia"". I'm convinced that another director like Brian De Palma or Neil Jordan, who were also both considered for directing this movie, would had done more good with the movie its story and concept. The movie is still slightly better than a passable thriller thanks to it's cast. Denzel Washington is a great main lead but really magnificent was Meryl Streep. Wow, that woman can act. Another solid role is being portrayed by Bruno Ganz.It of course still is a watchable movie but overall it's still a slightly disappointing one, due to its lacking atmosphere and tension, plus the fact that the movie leaves more questions than answers.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Manchurian Candidate
20,view_and_review,When Phillip Morris & R.J. Reynolds get serious,7,26 February 2007,"I know that ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was a remake, but I didn't see the original, so the movie is brand new to me. I thought the movie was satisfyingly good. I mean, the concept of governmental conspiracies is nothing new, it's all a matter of what conspiracy you are detailing, and how you present it. This was a conspiracy that wasn't too far from the realm of believability. A big business wants a man in office with their interests in mind. Their presidential candidate is a war hero as testified to by other military men... or so you're lead to believe. This presidential candidate and other military men have gone through psychological torture so that the Manchurian company can totally control their minds.This movie represents the next step in progression from big business lobbyists to full out controlling the decision maker(s). It is no mystery that some big biz lobbyists are greasing the palms of law makers as it is, but how can you absolutely ensure that you will get the vote or decision you desire?",The Manchurian Candidate
21,evanston_dad,A Limp Remake of a Movie That Didn't Need Remaking,4,6 November 2006,"This earnest bore of a remake gets wrong everything that the 1962 original got right.No one bothered to ask why a remake of a virtually perfect movie was necessary in the first place, but if you're going to remake this film, why make such a pale imitation. Jonathan Demme and company plainly didn't understand that the black humour John Frankenheimer used so liberally in the 1962 version made that film unique, and that the stark, documentary-style film-making techniques gave it an immediacy that keeps it relevant today. Demme instead turns the story into another righteous and dull vehicle for Denzel Washington to go with all of the other righteous and dull vehicles he's starred in, and he manages to do nothing but drain all of the life out of material I didn't think could possibly become lifeless.Meryl Streep chokes on the Angela Lansbury role, through no fault of her own. The script gives her no opportunity to chomp away with a scenery-chewing part, so she fades into the background, like most of this pallid film.Just rent the original and use your copy of this as a bookend.Grade: C",The Manchurian Candidate
22,HotToastyRag,Fantastic remake with great acting,8,30 April 2020,"In the remake of the 1964 thriller, Denzel Washington takes on Frank Sinatra's role as a war veteran drawn into a political web of destruction. The setting is moved to the current time, so instead of being a Korean war veteran, Denzel fought in the Gulf War. His fellow soldier, Liev Schreiber, comes from a political background and is seen as a front-runner for the upcoming election, thanks to his pushy and powerful mother Meryl Streep. While in the original, Angela Lansbury controlled her son, Laurence Harvey, to help her husband's political career, the remake gets another modern touch: Meryl herself is a senator, rather than a housewife.Meryl's performance in this movie is so chilling, it'll throw you for a greater loop than the story to find out she wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. Taking obvious inspiration from a certain powerful, ruthless female politician of the 1990s, Meryl embodies the bloodsucking, calculating, viscous character in her most realistic performance since The Bridges of Madison County.The wonderful thing about this story is it's obviously timeless. It was just as relevant and engrossing in 1964 as it was in 2004, and if another remake would be made in 2024, it would be just as well-received. Political power struggle is an unending game, and if you combine a mystery in the movie plot and cast a bundle of powerhouse actors, you've got a guaranteed box office smash. If you've never seen either version, look at the cast list and decide which one you want to start with. They're both very good, suspenseful, and well-acted, but you can only watch it for the first time once. Choose wisely-or Meryl Streep will yell at you.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During Denzel Washington's dreams, there are some zooms, swirls, and handheld camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",The Manchurian Candidate
23,Sylviastel,Not as Good as the Original!!,8,3 June 2007,"Kudos for Meryl Streep taking on the role that made Angela Lansbury unforgettable on screen. Anyway that's the main reason to see this film is because of Meryl Streep's take on Senator Prentiss Shaw, the mother of a congressman and hopeful vice presidential candidate. His mother always wanted to be president but never made it far enough and only on her husband's death, did she become a United States Senator. While female senators are not unheard of like Hillary Clinton, Barbara Mikulski, Elizabeth Dole, Olympia Snowe, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Fienstein, and others that I may have omitted. The film has Mother Shaw pushing for her disturbed son to be made Vice Presidential candidate. Of course, Denzel Washington is the Frank Sinatra role who tries to stop a disaster. The film has a lot of flaws in it and I won't reveal anymore. I think it should have been more faithful to the original. Jon Voight plays a rival to Streep as well.",The Manchurian Candidate

I wouldn't waste my money, save it for video.  Then at least you can forward through some of the boring movie.  I should of known better than to go see a Denzel Washington movie.  I do not like any of his films.  A lot of the scenes did not make any sense and seemed to be out of place.  I do not know if this was the director's intension, but some scenes ended so abruptly.

And this isn't a bad movie, but it suffers from that comparison. The good thing about this movie is that it updates the war setting and branches out into its own thing. I think the dialogue scenes are where the film is most effective. Jonathan Demme has his cast address the audience head-on and it's a deeply unsettling effect. But he also uses this sparingly, so the rest of the movie (aside from the vicious scenes in the operating room) is rather saggy.

Sporting a good cast and a somewhat cluttered screenplay, the film tells of the plight of a Desert Storm vet (Washington) whose dreams tell a story of what happened to his platoon in Kuwait quite different from the historical account of record with ramifications reaching deep into a U.S. presidential election. A little bulky at two hours, this suspense/drama flick waxes in convolutions and intrigues all the while dangling the ""dreams or reality?"" question before the audience. With par murmurs from critical corners and mixed commentary from the public in general, this three star flick is probably worth a look for fans of the players or anyone into political thrillers, etc. (B)",The Manchurian Candidate

28,Buddy-51,contemporary spin on a classic,8,18 October 2005,"Jonathan Demme's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a superb and timely 21st Century remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 classic of Cold War terror and paranoia. For this new version, the Cold War has been replaced by the War on Terror as the menacing background against which the story unfolds, but, apart from that, the major plot points in both films are virtually the same. Both involve a group of soldiers who are brainwashed into believing that one of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, is a hero whose unquestioning bravery and quick thinking on the battlefield saved the lives of most of the men in that squadron. (The original's Korean War setting has been updated to the Gulf War's Desert Storm). In fact, upon his return, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, a tribute he eventually parlays into a career as a United States congressman. After several of the men in the squadron begin having the same recurring nightmare in which they are being subjected to murderous hypnotic suggestions, one of them, Captain/Major Bennett Marco, comes to suspect that they may all be the victims of some nefarious scheme to implant them with microchips to get them to believe something that is not true. One of the few key differences between the new version and the old version is that the ""Manchurian"" of the title no longer refers to the Communists who do the brainwashing but rather to a mega-corporation (called Manchurian Global) that has positioned itself as the master puppeteer pulling the strings of government behind the scenes. And in its scathing vision of modern day politics, the film asks just how much of our freedom and civil liberties we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for ""security"" and ""safety."" No theme could be more timely.It would be a disservice to ""The Manchurian Candidate"" to reveal too much about its ingeniously contrived plot, which is chock full of intrigue, suspense and larger-than-life events and people. The dominating figure in the nightmare scenario is Eleanor Shaw, an uber-powerful senator and the ultimate Machiavellian matriarch, whose unrelenting and nefarious effort to get her craven, mediocre Congressman son elected Vice President, serves as the engine that pulls the story forward. Thus, while Marco spends his time trying to piece together some semblance of the truth out of the fabricated memories and distorted half-truths spinning around in his jumbled memory and mind, Eleanor works her way to the ultimate position of power.This new ""Candidate"" gleans its topicality and its contemporary significance by zeroing in on the nexus that exists between politics and the corrupt military-industrial complex - a connection made even more frightening when the latter, working in a moral vacuum, is able to employ the latest in technological advancements to further its cause.Although the surrealistic elements are probably less shocking today than they were in 1962, the film still does an amazing job replicating the dislocation and fragmentation of Marco's mind, establishing a beautiful balance between the world of ""real"" reality and the world of virtual reality, a concept that seems far less incredible in this day and age of ubiquitous computer technology.Denzel Washington takes over the role of Marco, originally played by Frank Sinatra, and Live Schreiber replaces Laurence Harvey as the mother-dominated Shaw. Both actors are superb. But it is Meryl Streep, stepping in for Angela Lansbury as the Big Bad Mama Supreme, who walks off with the film. Her portrayal of a ruthless and icy Lady MacBeth who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is bone-chilling and unforgettable.In an age in which most thrillers are formulaic, empty exercises in high-tech wizardry and flash, perhaps it was necessary to reach back 42 years to find a work of power and substance to remind us of just how dangerous it is to allow modern technology to fall into the hands of the power-hungry and the ruthless. Indeed, what this gripping tale of an attempted coup against the United States government manages to do is to remind us that, even in this age of international terrorism, the greatest threat to our unity as a nation and our safety as a people may actually come from within.",The Manchurian Candidate
29,sol-kay,Stick To The Original,6,30 July 2004,"****SPOILERS**** Uneven and confusing remake of the 1962 spine tingling political thriller that goes all over the place trying to connect a Haliburton-like corporate giant, Manchurian Global,in it's sub rosa efforts to try to take over the US government via mind control by controlling the brain of it's future head of state. Unlike the original ""Manchurian Candidate"" with Frank Sinatra Laurence Harvey Angela Lansbury and Janet Leigh which was riveting and built up to an almost unbearable tension packed ending that floored you. The new version is as limp and soggy as the instant oriental noodles that Denzel Washington, Maj. Ben Marco, was eating throughout the film. Replacing the Soviet Union and their Communist Chinese allies in the 1962 classic by Big Business as the villains in this version made the movie far less believable. Since we all know that Big Business can easily, as if it doesn't already, control practically any US politician that it wants from the President of the United States on down. With batches of lettuce and green stuff, you know moolah, or better yet United States Treasury notes. The idea of having to plant a micro-chip in the brain or back of a future President of the United States in order to control him is really quite brainless in this movie. Raymond Shaw, Liev Schreiber, a two term congressman from New York who's running for Vice President with the challenger for president of the US Governor Robert Arthur, Tom Stechsculte, is all wrong in the part of a brainwashed GI who earned the Congressional Medal of Honor during the fighting in Kuwait in the Gulf War of January-February 1991. Schreiber blows every scene that he's in by overacting in the part of a man under the influence of outside forces beyond his control and is so obviously strange and weird every time that you see him you wonder why those on the screen, besides Maj. Ben Marco, don't see that too? Raymond's Mother Eleanor Shaw, Meryl Streep, who made a deal with Manchurian Global to put an implant in her son Raymond's head that will get him to ascend to the presidency is so off-the-wall, even more then Raymond, that you expected at almost any time in the movie to see a number of men in white suits charge at her with butterfly nets to hand-cuff and restrain her and put her into a padded cell. Denzel Washington who I thought was playing the Frank Sinatra part in this version of the ""Manchurian Candidate"" changes unexpectedly to the part played by Laurence Harvey in the original movie as the mind-controlled assassin that should have been played by Liev Schreiber? Kimberly Elise who I thought was playing the part of Janet Leigh, Rosie, changes also unexpectedly to play the part that Frank Sinatra played in the original movie right at the end just before the shooting started? Thats just how confusing the new version of the ""Manchurian Candidate"" is to those, like myself, who saw the original version of the movie.Unlike the powerhouse conclusion of the original the new version of the ""Manchurian Candidate"" was so slow and drawn out that it almost puts you to sleep watching it with both Raymond and his mother in some bizarre dance of death finish. The ending didn't have the shock and jolts that the original had and even the actors on the screen didn't seem that frightened or paralyzed with fear and in many cases didn't even notice what was happening. The makers of the new ""Manchurian Candidate"" couldn't just leave well enough alone and have it end right there and then. They had to add on to the film a new ""Surprise Ending"" which made no sense at all and just prolonged both the grief and suffering to those in the movie as well those watching it. The only surprise that I got from the movie is why on earth it was ever made in the first place?",The Manchurian Candidate
30,Lejink,Doesn't get my vote,3,11 June 2018,"I made the big mistake of watching the black and white original 1962 movie, starring Sinatra, Lawrence Harvey and Angela Lansbury not long before watching this latter-day remake. That John Frankenheimer - directed film is comfortably in my top 10 all-time movies, while it's fair to say that this Jonathon Demme version isn't.I allowed all the licence I could to the new film while watching it, from the awkward way they got the original title, so naturally important and relevant to the original, into the plot here, to the other changes in the narrative and roles of the main players, but the fact of the matter is that this feature has nothing like the original's sense of pace, drama, suspense or excitement. Even the scene-setting first shot, of Denzel Washington's Captain Ben Marco's character's troop of carousing young Desert Storm soldiers takes an age to move on to a shot of Liev Schreiber's Raymond Shaw sitting apart from them, both shots however hardly demonstrating the former's disdain or loathing for him or his alienation from them. The effect of this is to undermine their later pre-ordained litany of admiration for him after he's awarded the Congressional Medal Of Honour for his miraculously rescuing them (or did he?) when they're all ambushed.It doesn't improve from there. For me the most memorable scene from the earlier movie was the masterly way the brainwashing scene and its attendant slaughters of the innocents was chillingly but imaginatively realised. Here it's done in a much more confusing and slapdash way, incorporating images of the faces of tribal females for reasons I couldn't decipher. Shaw's romance with Jocelyn Jordan is played down so much that it significantly reduces the impact of her and her father's later demises, again unlike the shocking double-sequence in the original.Listen, I could go on and on, detrimentally comparing and contrasting the new against the old, but even if the later film had appeared as an original work, I'd still have struggled to work up enthusiasm for it. The casting here is uninspired too, Washington appears suitably confused throughout, Meryl Streep phones in her trademark unsurprising ""Iron Lady"" performance, the casting obviously forgetting about the devastating impact of Angela Lansbury's casting against type previously, while Schreiber seems content to just copy Lawrence Harvey's playing as if he's over-studied the part.The climax at the party convention, like so many others in this film, was so played out it lost any prospect of achieving a nail biting finish. One of the binding factors in the earlier movie was its topicality, especially as the Kennedy assassination followed so soon after its release, whereas here the events played out seem too fantastic and contrived to in any way convince the viewer that something like this could have happened now.Really, this is a very poor remake of a very good film and I urge anyone who watched this movie, whether they liked it or not to look out that original. I promise you that you won't be disappointed.",The Manchurian Candidate

32,MOscarbradley,One of the best of all remakes,8,14 October 2007,"At least Jonathan Demme had the wherewithal not to make a straightforward remake, changing major details in the plot and updating the action to the Gulf War and the present. In fact, had the Frankenhimer movie not existed I might have rated this very highly indeed and in some respects it outstrips the original, (it's much better on the paranoia theme). Now, of course, it's all about oil and not communism and builds on the kind of conspiracy theories that Michael Moore has been pushing for a while; (alright, the details are sufficiently far-fetched but the ideas are genuinely scary).It's also brilliantly made. It's got a cracker of a script by Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris that builds on Axelrod's adaptation of Richard Condon's novel and both Denzel Washington and Liev Schreiber are excellent. Meryl, (in the Angela Lansbury role as Raymond's mother), is, of course, superb but she goes so far out of her way to reinterpret the role she never seems to nail the character in the way Lansbury did. You can believe in Streep as a hard-nosed politico whereas Lansbury was a loony tune but she was a loony tune you believed in and that made her really, really scary. Nevertheless, this still might be one of the best remakes ever made.",The Manchurian Candidate
33,dromasca,bad script - still a political thriller above the average,6,28 January 2005,"This film is quite amazing - in a different manner. I have seldom seen a movie based on such a bad script recently. The story is a story of mind manipulation, trying to play the crowd in the electoral year 2004 and collect some blockbuster coupons based on it. Still, a political thriller is supposed to be credible, its quality demands that we can believe that the story can happen today or tomorrow and here. I neither read the book, or seen the original film, but the story in this one has enormous holes, and despite the present or close future tense context is so exaggerated and so improbable that it gets close to ridicule. Characters supposed to be quite smart act in a ridiculous manner, endangering their own purposes. To make things worse, the end is so unclear - meaning not the facts, but the motivation of the characters, that I had to read some IMDb comments to understand what it was supposed to be about.And still, it is not a bad movie. It does succeed in a different then expected context, and it is probably the merit of director Jonathan Demme ('Silence of the lambs', 'Philadelphia') to have saved the day. What is credible - unfortunately - is the terrifying vision of the USA in a near future, with the war on terror having gone wrong, with armed soldiers patrolling the streets and news flashes bringing on TV screens home items from war fronts from what are still nowadays peaceful places on the globe. This seems today - unfortunately - so probable.Acting is superb, and the director skill keeps the interest in the movie high despite the really unbelievable basic plot lines. That's how at the end of the day 'The Manchurean Candidate' is not a bad film, despite the script. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Manchurian Candidate

It uses an interesting idea of a power hungry company using mind control to maneuver their ""candidate"" into the the presidency of the USA.And Streep makes a great evil senator.

The assumed choice, Senator Jordan (Jon Voight) is upset. So is his daughter, Jocelyn (Vera Farmiga) a former love interest of Raymond's. Sensing his dreams are important, Ben begins to search into the history of Ray Shaw and others who were in their company. What he discovers is frightening. The soldiers may have been brainwashed, including candidate Shaw. As folks begin to die mysteriously, will anyone believe Marco's version of the truth, making for a dangerous man about to become an important leader? This is a spellbinding update of a classic. Now, instead of the Korean War, we have the Persian Gulf and a large corporation named Manchurian replaces a region in China. Nevertheless, the themes of mind control, brain washing and puppet leaders is very scary. The cast is superb, with special merit extended to Schreiber for a truly understated and sensitive character. Sets, costumes, script and direction are of the finest. Why not make it a viewing marathon and watch both versions back to back? Now, that's a candidate for an interesting evening!",The Manchurian Candidate
37,tabuno,A Tense Filled Espionage Thriller,8,25 January 2019,"2 August 2004. In the classic mold of The Ipcress File, The Spy Who Came From the Cold, The Three Days of Condor, this remake also holds the audience with its tension-filled, mystery thriller. The characters including Meryl Streep and Liev Schriebner are rounded, more three-dimensional characters than most movies nowadays. The well-paced movie offers a decent thrill ride of psychological, one man fighting for the Country's freedom. The ending a little syrupy, still offers the traditional twist and probes the question of the nature of the human spirit and its ability to triumph over evil. Perhaps might criticize this movie for its superficial replication of past espionage movies like ""Enemy of the State"" (1998) where Jon Voight also had a co-starring role, yet the connection between Denzel Washington and Liev Schriebner and between Meryl Streep and Liev Schriebner are poignant and powerful.

38,The-Sarkologist,A rather dry conspiracy film,5,12 September 2013,"I guess in a new age of hysteria and paranoia where people believe that terrorists could be hiding next door, or plotting the next attack on American soil, that a remake of this movie needed to come out. However the problem is that the premise of this movie changes somewhat from the communist conspiracy that planned on placing a hypnotised vice president into the White House to control at will to a shadowy equity fund doing the same thing, but also setting up a presidential assassination on election night to drive the American people into such fear that they would pretty much give up all of their freedom for security.This seems to be one of those things with the American society, the conflict between freedom and security – we want to be secure from our enemies but we do not want to give up our freedoms to gain that security. Obviously there is also that argument that if you are not doing anything wrong then there is nothing to worry about, and that is all well and good until you suddenly discover that the things that you do have suddenly been made illegal, or you are arrested on trumped up charges.This film, like the book, is about fear, paranoia, and control. It is interesting that they never actually say which political party the candidate represents, and there is no actual mention of the War on Terror, or the War in Iraq, but I guess it is a warning as to how things can move. Granted America has enemies – everybody has enemies – it is a natural part of life, but the question comes down to how does one respond to those enemies, and is one doing things that is creating more of those enemies.Some have suggested that this film is just some paranoid left-wing conspiracy, but to be honest with you, I have seen some videos produced by some conspiracy theorists on the far right that are just as out there as this film. I consider myself somewhat left leaning (though not extreme as some are, though I suspect compared to the average American I probably am quite extreme) but generally ignore theories such as the American Government blew up the twin towers to start the war on terror, though I have watched some of those documentaries and it is scary the amount of research that they seem to put into them, and they are quite convincing. However, most of these videos usually come down to one argument, and that the American nationalism, which is not left wing, but right wing to the extreme.",The Manchurian Candidate

41,jzappa,An Acute Reflection of Our Political State of Affairs,9,13 July 2011,"Though the original is far and away superior, this ""remake,"" if you view it that way, is one of a small handful of narrative films that have proposed the profound reality of our political era: Corporations, not Commies, are the threatening power behind Demme's The Manchurian Candidate, in which suffering Raymond Shaw is told by a progressive senator, played by Jon Voight of all people, ""You are about to become the first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States."" There's a degree of suspicion here that's more infuriating and frightening than the Red Chinese rogues in Frankenheimer's 1962 masterpiece. It's suspension of disbelief to conceive of a communist regime change in America, but the indication that corporations may be undermining the democratic process is as credible as ever in the time of Rupert Murdoch's propaganda empire and Bush's endorsement of a bill written by his top campaign contributor making it much harder for middle-class Americans to get a second chance when paying off their debts. Demme's re-imagining of this brilliant story was released in 2004, a year during which more of us went bankrupt than graduated college. And since this film, we've taken lying down unlimited campaign finance, Deepwater Horizon, the GOP's forced elimination of union collective bargaining, billionaires funding climate change skeptic groups to support their fossil fuel industries, and no accountability for any of it.Demme is not timid about signifying congruences with contemporary politics, and he sponges a clever trace of trickiness from the '62 version, wherein communists were indeed the McCarthyites exploiting panic to undermine American freedoms. In this rendering, right-wingers profess to be liberals to gain office while sterilizing the left. Meryl Streep plays Sen. Eleanor Shaw, who has bargained herself ball and chain to Manchurian Global Corp. A sublimation of both matriarch and succubus with balls, as Streep was born to play, she presses her son Raymond into the vice presidency. An opportune act of terror will make him president. Raymond has a chip entrenched in his skull which will let Manchurian manipulate him.This strategy is on course and will work, unless two men can decipher their realities. Marco and Melvin both served a Gulf patrol that was rescued by the gallantry of Sgt. Shaw, whose Medal of Honor instigated his political career. But did Shaw actually save them? Marco and Melvin have disjointed nightmares of a disparate certainty. Marco notices that all the patrol members use verbatim identical words to explain the event. ""I remember that it happened,"" Shaw admits to Marco, ""but I don't remember it happening."" Audiences of the earlier film will know what happens during the patrol's omitted days before Marco does. So, those obligations are concentrated further toward the beginning in this adaptation. It's unraveled quite soon, possibly since Demme and scripters Pyne and Georgaris saw no benefit in being bashful about a surprise that most of the audience already sees. Rather, Demme shrewdly obscures other mysteries, culminating in a wicked reversal of the original, right when you feel you know everything that'll take place.Washington plays Marco with the facade of a decorated officer and the internalized distress of a troubled man. After he finds a chip in his own flesh, he frantically struggles to reach Shaw to confer the incident from their past. Once, Marco actually seizes the eponymous candidate and forcefully attempts to gnaw a chip out from the same place. Secret Service secures him, but Shaw refuses to seek allegations, leaving us to speculate on how round-the-clock commercial media covers the extraordinary exhibition of a decorated veteran mauling a valiant candidate, but only for a second or so.Schreiber plays Shaw, the real victim at the heart of the story. Streep has the task of playing the disturbing and psychologically abusive role for which Angela Lansbury was deservedly nominated. Streep shrewdly settles on sideways humor instead of headlong evil, making the character her own and also equally vile. Rumors had murmured for months that she is shaped after Hillary Clinton, but that would be too cartoonish. Streep has claimed to evoke Peggy Noonan, Condi Rice and Dick Cheney. Demme also leaks clever modern allusions into the movie via several characters.It was printed at the time that the film is more politically biased than Fahrenheit 9/11, though that necessitates a less demanding, more exchangeable narrative than the one I experienced. Demme stabs everywhere, insinuating that the entire democratic system has been bargained by the unlimited sway of corporations. It's just that people who vote Democrat seem to have less issue with the reality that corporatism and oligarchy are the encroaching muscle in the information age, not petty generalizations of socialism.What makes the original Manchurian Candidate such a transcendent act of filmmaking is that we ourselves are subliminally tantalized by the odds that there may be another, deeper-rooted plane of conspiracy that we're meant to intuit without totally grasping. While keeping its plot consistently different and distinctive, this version too has characters occur unexpectedly, sometimes saying or doing enigmatic things. To accept Kimberly Elise's character as a run-of-the-cliché romantic prospect is too superficial.What ultimately makes Demme's version of Richard Condon's brilliant political allegory is that to evaluate it against Frankenheimer's is sort of irrelevant. The story truly is timeless. That was the Cold War, this is the digital age. Sinatra and Washington are both comprehensive and independent and cannot be importantly contrasted. What we can say is that Demme has taken a story we thought we knew and, while making its framework generally familiar, evolved it into another position of conspiracy. Are corporations truly a menace to America's wellbeing? In a time when poor Americans pay taxes while most wealthy ones pay no income taxes at all, and corporate tax breaks kill more of the former's jobs, I'd say Demme's got a point. Democrats needed at least one Republican to support a bill to limit corporate influence on campaign finance. Not one.",The Manchurian Candidate

It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",The Manchurian Candidate
43,dfranzen70,Excellent rethinking of original,7,12 March 2005,"Wow, excellent movie. Jonathan Demme basically updated the 1962 political thriller so that the soldiers were in the Gulf War (the first one), and added a few other twists, too.Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is the former captain of a patrol that was ambushed in the middle of the desert. After Marco was knocked out, Pvt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schrieber) saved the entire patrol singlehandedly.Or did he? Another former soldier from the platoon reports having a long series of bad dreams, dreams that seems to indicate a different chain of events that that remembered by Marco and the other soldiers. By this time, Shaw has successfully run for Senate under the ""war hero"" banner and is now angling for a spot on the presidential ticket. Orchestrating Shaw's political moves is his mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep), a senator with more brass than most of the males in her profession.Marco's ability to discern real from fake blurs instantly and frequently; is it possible Shaw is not the hero all have made him out to be? In this slight rethinking of the classic, Demme hasn't made the update any less creepy or less involving. Even those who saw the original won't know which way to turn. Only debit, perhaps, is Streep (surprisingly!), who's a bit one-note and hammy.",The Manchurian Candidate
44,ackstasis,"""There's always casualties in war, sir.""",7,11 June 2007,"Recent Hollywood remakes do not have a particularly promising track record. Nine times out of ten they are poorly-made, uninspired and completely unnecessary. Imagine my surprise, then, to discover that Jonathan Demme's 'The Manchurian Candidate' is actually quite a solid political thriller, with excellent performances and a subtext that is worryingly relevant in today's society. Whilst I wouldn't say that it comes close to touching John Frankenheimer's 1962 Cold War masterpiece, it is certainly a very worthy effort. During the first Gulf War, a platoon of American soldiers, headed by Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington), is captured by an unknown enemy and unknowingly brainwashed. One soldier, a quiet loner named Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), has since been declared a hero, and, helped along by his ambitious domineering mother, Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), has become the next vice-presidential candidate. Troubled by an endless string of disturbing dreams, Marco begins to suspect that there is something amiss about his haunting war-time encounter, and he approaches Raymond Shaw to try and learn the truth.It's very easy to get caught up in comparisons when reviewing a remake, but I'd just like to take a few moments to reflect on what makes the original 'Manchurian Candidate' such a great film. At the height of the Cold War, brainwashing by Communists must have seemed a very real threat. The very idea that Communists could be controlling respected American citizens  war heroes and politicians, no less  would have seemed extremely shocking and terrifying. With his film, Demme is not really able to play on such paranoia, but, in a good attempt, he draws on the War on Terror, which was one of the primary issues of the 2004 Presidential campaign.Rather than targeting Middle-Eastern terrorists to replace the original's Communists (as I would have expected), the film singles out a large fictional American corporation, Manchurian Global, as the perpetrator. Perhaps this could be seen as a cop-out to avoid controversy, but, then again, it probably would have just stood in the way of a good thriller. I was disappointed, however, to find that my favourite scene from the original film  the bizarre, sterile brainwashing demonstration hidden amongst an innocent-seeming gardening class  had been omitted in favour of a more frenetic, fast-paced dream sequence. Like I said, though, it's easy to become obsessed with comparisons, and it's good to see than Demme has chosen his own path.The acting in the film is very solid, with both Washington and Schreiber turning in good, paranoid performances. Meryl Streep threatens to steal the limelight as the cold, ruthless and authoritative Senator Shaw, delivering her lines with a sort of twisted amusement. Jon Voight is adequate but unremarkable as Raymond Shaw's political opponent Senator Thomas Jordan. I wasn't a fan of actress Kimberly Elise, who played Marco's sudden love interest (the equivalent of Janet Leigh's role in the 1962 version). I found her character a bit annoying at times, and her true identity, when it is revealed, was a bit unlikely for me to accept.The ending of the film was just a tiny bit of a letdown. In terms of the identity of the assassin, it deviates a bit from the original (which is perfectly fine), but I would have rathered a more downbeat ending. The climax would have been much more powerful if Marco had died after the assassination. Nevertheless, I am pleased to report that Jonathan Demme's 'The Manchurian Candidate' is an engrossing political thriller, and, in my mind at least, a worthy remake of the classic original.",The Manchurian Candidate
45,MBunge,Are we sure this wasn't directed by some other Jonathan Demme? One who does porn or something?,3,11 January 2011,"A lot of movies rely on the suspension of disbelief in order to make their stories work. The only way this film could have worked is if someone had taken a meat cleaver and cut out my disbelief without using anesthetic. I have seen some stupid ass motion pictures in my time, pitiful excuses for entertainment that were so desolately dumb they would make you question the existence of a kind and loving God. The remake of The Manchurian Candidate might just top them all.That's because this colossally cretinous disaster wasn't pounded out by some talentless dreamers who scrounged together a few thousand dollars and rounded up a few desperately out-of-work actors to try and make their filmmaking delusions come true. Jonathan Demme made this thing. Trying to put this alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia is like trying to imagine Leonardo Da Vinci taking a break between masterpieces to smear his own feces all over his bedroom walls. The sheer throw weight of idiocy at work here is that shocking.The remake of The Manchurian Candidate tosses plausibility into a wood chipper, has all the subtlety of stapling your testicles to someone else's leg and shows as much attention to detail as an Alzheimer's patient. This is the kind of movie where it honestly looks like the cast and crew forgot what the film was about while they were making it, changed their approach to the story at least 4 or 5 times and then somebody got hired to try and edit the resulting incoherent bits into something resembling a single story.I'm pretty much going to give away the story, butA. If you haven't already seen the original, you really should. AndB. This film is not only devoid of any mystery and tells you everything that's going to happen within the first 10 minutes, it then repeats itself over and over to be sure that even single-celled organisms that might be in the audience know what's going on.Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) is a Gulf War hero whose viciously political mother (Meryl Streep) has maneuvered into being a heartbeat away from the Presidency. The only thing standing in his way is his old commanding officer Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and his conviction that both he and Shaw were the subject of brainwashing experiments by an evil investment firm that wants to take over the government. In fact, they were brainwashed as part of an dementedly convoluted plan that would have made Rube Goldberg blanch. The same basic stuff is gone over again and again until the movie wraps up by leaping from suggested incest to utterly contradicting it's most fundamental premise.If I tried to recap all the imbecilic nonsense in the remake of The Manchurian Candidate, this review would be longer than the unabridged edition of Stephen King's The Stand. So, let me give you only one example that sums it all up. After Raymond Shaw is named his party's Vice-Presidential candidate, he goes back to his hotel suite. Well, it turns out the people who brainwashed him over a decade ago have set up a sophisticated operating theater in the room next door. They cut a hole in the wall between the two rooms, bring Shaw over and perform some brain surgery on him. And that all happens without anyone in the Secret Service, with the media or on the hotel staff noticing anything. John Edwards can't have a baby momma without the whole world knowing, but Raymond Shaw can get a hole bored into his skull in the midst of the campaign without anyone being the wiser.There's sooooooo much more to criticize about this movie, but I'm afraid if I go on I'll give myself an ulcer. Watch the original Manchurian Candidate. All copies of the remake should be set on fire.",The Manchurian Candidate
46,Chris_Docker,Overlong,5,20 November 2004,"Overlong remake  some good acting by veteran Meryl Streep but the attempts at sci-fi tension seem outdated. Would it work better for American audiences? The site of a group of US soldiers bonding raucously over a game of cards (opening intro) during the Gulf War doesn't create automatic empathy these days outside of the USA. When we discover that one of them is a brainwashed spy for a big corporation it doesn't really seem to matter very much  the good guys and bad guys are so similar, both giving lipservice to words like 'democracy' in a way that everyone outside of the USA is now pretty familiar with and frankly bored by. The election fever provides more yankee navel-gazing  the picture goes full circle of an inward looking nation that tries to run the rest of the world by remote control without ever understanding it.",The Manchurian Candidate
47,jimbo-53-186511,"Stylistically it is a bit 'showy' at times, but the narrative and performances are superb",8,8 April 2017,"Gulf war veterans Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and Raymond Shaw (Live Schreiber) are comrades in Kuwait in 1991, but when their platoon is attacked under mysterious circumstances the two men end up separated with little recollection of what happened after their platoon was attacked. Fast forward 13 years and the two men meet again under very different circumstances and both men soon learn that they were part of a terrible experiment.First of all I would like to say that I have not seen the original film so anyone who wants a blow-by-blow analysis between the two films is best off looking elsewhere, but for what it's worth this is my take on this version of The Manchurian Candidate...I believe that this is categorised as a Conspiracy thriller and in that respect it works very well; it's easy to become swept up in the paranoia of the whole thing and the fact that Washington's character is always just about on the right side of sanity helps to keep things interesting and help give the film a sense of urgency. Although some elements of the narrative are slightly predictable (clearly there is a government conspiracy of some kind involved), but in these type of films knowing what is involved is only half the battle and knowing why said party is involved and how this aspect of the story is going to be resolved is the other half of the puzzle and that's where The Manchurian Candidate does come good. Live Schreiber is the other strong link in the film and is on the other side of the fence in the early stages - in comparison to Washington's character he is apathetic and content in his elevated position in society and although he thinks Washington is crazy at first he slowly starts to believe that his old commander is perhaps more sane than anyone else. These two characters are what drive this picture forward and they manage to steal the limelight from veterans such as Streep and Voight - the former to me shows off a bit and the latter isn't given much to do.What I liked about this film though is that it is a clever film with a strong narrative, but it's never a film that goes overboard by trying to be too clever - in other words it doesn't tie itself in several plot twist knots. The ending is clever, but it's clever in a way that gets you thinking rather than being a silly curve ball style ending.My only real criticism with this film (and it is minor) is that Demme does get carried away stylistically at times - some of the dream sequences are overdone and a tad silly, but that's about as far as my criticism goes with this film. As I mentioned earlier, I haven't seen the original film so cannot comment on what that film is like, but for fans of conspiracy thrillers this version is definitely worth a look.",The Manchurian Candidate

Angela Lansbury was just too nice to be the mother in the original; what a shame that Meryl Streep wasnt around to do it better; because she is the best actress of at least two generations. That being said, the film stands up very well on its own and Washington always gives a texured performance. Schreiber kept reminding me of the bazinga guy on the comedy TV series, so I had trouble taking him seriously.

50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Sizzling political thriller,8,17 August 2015,"Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate is a perfect mesh of political and psychological thriller, and does a bang up job in both departments. Now I haven't seen the original film, but I loved this one based on its own merit. It's a sickeningly suspenseful nightmare, and shows a dark, corrupted path that we can only hope isn't as far gone as the States have become. Denzel Washington plays Bennett Marco, an ex military loner and war hero who's laying low, when a distraught army buddy (Jeffrey Wright, excellently portraying a fraying, fractured mind) reaches out to him, asking him to consider if the heroics they participated in that day in the gulf were actually real, some constructed memory implant, or something worse. He shows Bennett eerie drawings from his pervasive nightmares, and has trouble not breaking down when speaking of this. This encounter triggers unsettling memories in Marco himself, and as he begins to hallucinate and question the validity of his own recollections, he turns his attention to Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), another member of their unit who is now on the brink of unprecedented political power. Marco tries to confront him on what really happened, and what their nightmares mean, and initially looks like a sputtering lunatic. Gradually Shaw begins to wonder as well. Schreiber gives a forlorn, withdrawn take on him, mentally scarred by the past and pressured by his domineering, manipulative demon of a mommy (Meryl Streep, a deceptive, sociopathic spider in the best work of the film). They uncover secrets stemming back to their time in the Gulf, secrets that altered the pattern of events to come, and forever decimated any hope of sanity they have. As usual the conspiracy comes from within, and the more we learn about the intentions behind it, the more terrified and reminded of our world today we become. For 2004 it sure had a few uncanny predictions up its sleeve. The last thirty minutes are comprised of sharp, measured storytelling that most thrillers only dream of attaining. Denzel is great as always, playing Marco with a sceptical uncertainty, and eventually full out terror. Kimberly Elise rocks it as a mysterious woman who enters his life. Ratlike Simon Mcburney excels as a shady Doctor who enters their waking nightmares, only to lay a huge part in the atrocities committed against them later on. Jon Voight, Vera Farmiga, Bruno Ganz, Miguel Ferrer and Ted Levine all show up to round out the roster as well. Political thrillers don't get more pointed or disconcerting than this nausea inducing thrill ride, and it has the added benefit of the surreal mind games and stark, mentally disturbing imagery that will give you shivers.",The Manchurian Candidate
51,rooprect,My list of remakes that are superior to the original,8,24 September 2006,"In the history of remakes (or at least the few dozens I've seen), this is a rare one that is superior to the original.

Three's Company (1977 remake of the British sitcom ""Man About the House"")Every other remake I've ever seen has stunk. I watched this film expecting it to stink as well, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of loose ends, present in the original, were wrapped up neatly in this version. A lot of the plot made more logical sense. The modern context is much more digestible than the standard ""faceless Russian commie threat"" of the original. The acting of Denzel Washington is superior to that of Frank Sinatra. And although Meryl Streep's portrayal is not quite as chilling as Angela Lansbury's, it's much more believable and practical.Unless you enter into this movie with a total fanatical prejudice against remakes (which we all have to a certain degree), you will enjoy this film.",The Manchurian Candidate

This is a movie you definitely have to be in the right mood for but for what it is, It was done very well. The constant edge of your seat suspense was great as was the overall performances. The political undertones were pretty obvious and more then a bit disturbing.This movie was not really scary as much as it is creepy. It gets under your skin. The movie is confusing in some parts and there is a sort of waiting for all the many loose ends to tie up that can get a little frustrating but they do tie up in the end and that's a Good thing. Of coarse, there are negatives as well.

56,onepotato2,junk,1,2 April 2005,"Even though I am a huge fan of the original I expected to like this movie based on it's critical reception. Instead I was surprised to see that this movie was completely undeserving of it's good reviews. Forget about this movies problems as a remake, it's absolutely inept on it's own terms. It can barely get out of it's own way to tell a much less complicated version of the story. It's a sloppy, poorly edited, cluttered movie made from a very bad script, which heaps meaninglessness upon meaninglessness.It features trite and stupid developments, editing, acting, etc. stupid p.o.v. shots of actors looking into the camera; screwy character links and the delivery of weird pointless information to improbable recipients. It's full of stupid ancillary details (a rescued Bulgarian tech guy, senator Jordan kayaking, an elvis impersonator) It's ordinary where it should be special and special where it should be ordinary. It's been a while since I've seen such a mess.Denzel Washingtons is an emphatically crappy actor. His leaden work here is an exploration of blinking and stammering. His asinine teeth baring scene will leave you scratching your head.This dreck thinks its complex when it's just hopelessly naive and obvious. The final ""in-studio"" shot of Denzel on a beach is just one more confirmation that this thing hasn't got a clue artistically, technically or narratively.My mind is reeling from this piece of excretion. A stupid, stupid movie.",The Manchurian Candidate
57,Seraphion,Nice twists at the unpredictable spots,7,30 January 2015,"I haven't seen the original Sinatra movie, but for me this movie presents quite a solid story with quite a few unpredictable surprises along the way at some of the most unpredictable spots. A political thriller at most, this movie walks on one of the most classic assassin plot lines; an able man being brain-washed into being an effective assassin and another who tries to rid him from the brain-wash grasp. What I like is the twists and turns particularly the ones near the movie's ending where the seemingly protagonist and the puppet switch places for a moment. The overall acting is quite nice. Denzel Washington is as always able to live up the mystery driven character of Bennett Marco. Liev Schreiber also did well enough in portraying the steadfast man that's yet confused about his past. Having Jon Voight and Meryl Streep really help in putting the seriousness into the story.",The Manchurian Candidate
58,rosscinema,Film works well on it's own level,7,20 August 2004,"Despite the fact that this is a supposed remake of a great film this still works and it's because they have updated the conspiracy to something that is a real threat in this day and age. Story is about Capt. Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) who was on patrol in the Gulf War and was saved by Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) when their unit was ambushed. Ben runs into Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright) who was with him and he mentions that he remembers what happened but doesn't remember it happening! Ben starts having nightmares about being brainwashed but nobody believes him and he wants to talk to Raymond but he is being primed to run for the Vice Presidency. Ben also finds a microbe placed under the skin in his shoulder and now he must talk to Raymond and try to find out if he has the same problems with nightmares and remembering what exactly happened to them.*****SPOILER ALERT*****While talking to Raymond in private Ben notices a scar on him and bites him on the shoulder ripping out a microbe and now everyone thinks that he's a paranoid nut but Ben keeps investigating and finds a link to a company called The Manchurian Global Corp. that is funding the election and Raymond's mother Eleanor (Meryl Streep) is deeply involved. Eventually Ben comes to discover that he has been used right from the beginning and it has nothing to do with Muslim terrorists.This film is directed by Jonathan Demme who hasn't made very many films since ""The Silence of the Lambs"" but he's directed a pretty good movie here and he does it without tarnishing the image of either the original film or the book. While it would have been very easy to make Middle Eastern terrorists the main culprit Demme makes the evil force even more relevant to our society and he uses corporate America planning to take over the election by using a war hero to do it. There are many twists and turns and you never really know what's going on until the very end and that's part of the fun of watching this film. Characters pop up out of nowhere and your not sure if they're behind everything and there is also stretches where your guessing if the main characters are just imagining things. Many Demme regulars pop up such as Dean Stockwell, Charles Napier, Tracey Walter, and director Roger Corman all have roles. While this doesn't possess the overwhelming immediacy of the 1962 film this is still a solid thriller that has many pertinent issues at hand and it's a remake that works very well on it's own.",The Manchurian Candidate
59,nycritic,Evil Corporations Behind the Gears of Power.,9,16 March 2005,"It's very tricky to do a remake of a well-known movie which has gone into the history of film as one of the greatest political satires of all time because the film maker runs the risk of having it compared to the original. Which means measuring up. In the 30s and 40s remakes were even more common given the fact that technology was advancing and if a B film could be remade into a much better version of itself, then why not. Such were the cases of the second film versions of THE MALTESE FALCON and A STAR IS BORN, whose first versions are good, but dated, and whose remakes have become the stuff of cinema legend. But when remaking those much better known versions in the 70s for a third time, one can see just how inferior the resulting movie turned out to be.In the case of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, when it became picked as Jonathan Demme's next follow-up to THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE (itself an updated version of CHARADE) there was much speculation among those who know the story as to who would play Mrs. Iselin, Raymond Shaw, and Ben Marco. Once Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep were announced as principal actors, speculations became even stronger: Denzel could be seen as the tortured Marco, but would Streep, for all her perfectionism in acting, be able to convince as Mrs. Iselin (now dubbed Mrs. Shaw)? No one had ever seen her play a character that evil and I could only assume it was the challenge to prove that she could. She would be up against a role Angela Lansbury had made her own.On viewing this version, less a remake than a reworking (it is its own film), I was surprised in a good way. All of the actors measured up and the film is definitely stylized in Demme's lush, sometimes surreal style. Out was the pitch-black humor present in the first version, in was the heightened paranoia that at times seemed to want to bleed right off the screen. A conspiracy stemmed from Communism gave way to corrupt corporations -- something which is more in touch with today's current events. Out, too, were the playing cards from the first, in were dermal microchips used to manipulate the mind. Where both films become joined is in the depiction of the inhuman violence that soldiers were forced to inflict on each other in order to assure they would turn into killing machines, and at times, some of Demme's sequences had a SILENCE OF THE LAMBS quality to them.Demme does take his own liberty in changing plot elements in his version. Rosie in the first movie only suggested as much about her enigmatic character; Kimberly Elise's role, in obeyance of these more feminist times, gets to do more than just suggest: she does, first in a submissive way, but progressively dominant. Her role determines that every conspiracy has its own counter-conspiracy.Speaking of Mrs. Shaw, if I had any doubts about Streep with all her accolades I was proved wrong: having her play less of an overt monster and more of what we see every day -- a tough female politician with a soft voice -- makes her equally terrifying: Streep models her from a variety of sources ranging from Condoleeza Rice to Hillary Clinton, and in her short yet powerful performance she makes you know who she is and what she is capable of (she is on screen for less time than Lansbury was in the first version but you never forget her).The men are no less forgettable: Liev Schreiber has the difficult role of the puppet able to do horrible things and being propelled to the spotlight and in many ways is similar to Lawrence Harvey. Washington's Ben Marco has a helplessness that lacked in Sinatra's portrayal; his broken man is a far cry from Sinatra's cocky Italian who recovers too fast. Washington makes us know that such things always haunt the person -- seeing his home in disarray, his life in shambles, looking like a man who is about to lose it at any moment as he sees another soldier (Jeffrey Wright) who suspects he was also a guinea-pig die (or be terminated) and loses Shaw's friendship. It's here that the emotional weight of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE becomes his story: he is alone in a world of nightmares, trying to make a dim sense of things, having to do the ultimate act of violence.",The Manchurian Candidate
60,Luigi Di Pilla,Too long but excellent performance of Liev Schreiber,6,7 May 2005,"I don't remember having seen the original version so I don't know what to say about; perhaps that the end was a little bit disappointing and confusing. The story is too long, at the beginning slow paced and some dialogs or scenes could have been cut. I don't find very good the idea of the implantation because they could have shown it in another way. Liev Schreiber impressed me very much with his strong performance as the Manchurian Candidate. I never saw or remarked him in his last films. I would give him the next Oscar for the best actor. I have to add only one favor to all the directors: Please cut in future the running time under two hours because we want to see fast paced movies but not too quick. My wife was also not very happy at the end and so that's why we gave 5.75/10. Too overrated on IMDb with actually votes of 6.7.

Shaw later becomes a vice-presidential candidate, using his hero status as political capital, while his commanding officer, Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is having nightmares about the incident in Kuwait. When he begins to investigate the validity of Shaws heroism, it seems that the top people at Manchurian Global corporation want to keep him quiet.Excellent performances from Washington, Schreiber and Streep help to update this story, but some of the plot did get lost in this re-worked edition of the Manchurian Candidate. While the film is still suspenseful and intriguing, it does ultimately reach an anti-climax, making it into a decent film, instead of the masterpiece that it had the potential to become.7/10",The Manchurian Candidate
63,dglink,Competent Remake Won't Eclipse the Original,7,2 August 2004,"Jonathan Demme is no John Frankenheimer, and the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" will be become cable fodder while the 1962 original is still showing in film schools. However, to be fair, few remakes equal or surpass the original films. Hitchcock's remake of his own ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and the George Cukor/Judy Garland version of ""A Star is Born"" both were better than the originals. A few like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" were technically superior to the earlier versions, if somewhat lacking elsewhere. But most remakes leave the viewer longing to see the originals again: ""Psycho,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""High Noon,"" ""Wuthering Heights,"" ""Lost Horizon."" A great deal of hubris is required to remake a film that was made perfectly the first time around. While I have some reservations about the original ""Manchurian Candidate,"" the film nevertheless did not warrant being refilmed. However, if it had to be remade, the Demme version is at least competent, has enough changes in the plot to keep the interest of viewers who are familiar with the original, and in a couple of instances equals or exceeds the 1962 movie. The performances are the strongest aspect of the 2004 filming and the one area that challenges the Frankenheimer version. While Angela Lansbury as the mother cannot be topped, Meryl Streep creates a contemporary version of the character that is every bit as ruthless and cold as Lansbury's original take. Liev Schreiber's Raymond Shaw is also on a par with Laurence Harvey's interpretation of the war-hero son. While many may disagree, my major reservation with the Frankenheimer version was Frank Sinatra, who was never my favorite actor, and I welcomed Denzel Washington, who seemed more intense and driven than did Sinatra in the same part. The other major improvement in the 2004 version is the justification of the Rosie character, who actually has a role this time around. In the original, I never could understand the Janet Leigh character who seemed to have wandered in from somewhere just to have a female name above the title. A good cast and a few plot changes make the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" worth viewing, but if you want to study how to film a taut, suspenseful, politically paranoid thriller see Frankenheimer's original. Better yet, have a triple bill and watch the original ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" and ""Seconds."" The talent of the young John Frankenheimer was nothing short of astounding.",The Manchurian Candidate
64,jon.h.ochiai,Manchurian Update,8,6 September 2004,"I have not seen the original John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"", which is considered one of the best political thrillers ever made. So it was curious that Jonathan Demme (a great director whose previous work included ""The Silence of the Lambs"") chose to remake the ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Still basing the story on the novel by Richard Condon, and the 1962 screenplay by George Axelrod, screen writers Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris have updated the Cold War political thriller to the global nuclear terrorism threat on our homeland, and introducing the clandestine presence of a ubiquitous corporation like Manchurian Global. Demme along with reinventing a contemporary storyline, assembled a powerful cast, Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber. Streep as Senator Eleanor Shaw, the mother of Vice Presidential candidate, Raymond Shaw (Schreiber), is absolutely powerful and compelling. She is playing against type-- her Eleanor Shaw is a Machiavellian Lady MacBeth. She is ruthless and smart. Streep's performance is awesome. During the Gulf War Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Schreiber) saved his fellow soldiers when his CO, Maj. Ben Marco (Washington) is knocked unconscious. Shaw receives the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery. Back to the present day, Eleanor Shaw (Streep) imposes her sheer will and brokers the Vice Presidential slot for her son, the War Hero, on her Party's ticket. Eleanor has political ties with the very powerful Manchurian Global corporation. Meanwhile, Maj. Marco is plagued by incoherent memories of what happened in Iraq. Were his memories actually manufactured? His investigation seems to point to brainwashing and a conspiracy. And what is the ultimate goal? Demme is a good storyteller. He keeps the story taut and paced. He also enlists effective performances from his talented cast. Denzel Washington is good as Marco. He is also playing somewhat against type. His Major Marco is a broken man regaining some of his honor, and he plays it very close to the vest. Marco is a not a charismatic character, but Washington imposes his own force on the character. Schreiber is amazing as Raymond Shaw. Outwardly, he might have played a puppet in an elaborate power play; however, he gives Shaw a strength of character that is riveting with internal conflict. Meryl Streep really steals the movie as Eleanor Shaw. Her performance is so commanding. Even in her ruthlessness and singularity, she can not be dismissed as plain evil, because ultimately her intentions are noble. That conflict embodied in her character makes ""The Manchurian Candidate"" worth watching.",The Manchurian Candidate
65,Rogue-32,"Remakes, schremakes",4,3 August 2004,"I really like The Manchurian Candidate - the original, with those incredibly great performances from Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra and of course Angela Lansbury, and I was curious to see what Jonathan Demme and his team would do with the material. They've done a lot. In fact, as is generally the case with commercial remakes, they've done too much - they changed all the best stuff that made the original so powerful (most specifically, the solitaire trigger), and they managed to turn every single plot point into a cliche, throwing all subtlety out the door in the process.In the original (which I saw again just last night, thanks to the release of the Special Edition dvd), a lot of the film's power comes from what is implied but not stated. In the remake, everything is stated, and stated. ..and stated. I think the only reason the remake is compelling at all is because Demme was smart enough to cast Liev Schreiber as Raymond Shaw - born just a few days apart from the great Laurence Harvey (different years, of course), Schreiber does bear an uncanny resemblance to him, from the back especially.  And his best move was casting the always-compelling Denzel Washington in the Marco role - if you were in a room with Denzel, you would find SOMETHING to do with him, no question about it.  And here, in this mind-bogglingly over-played scenario, he's still compelling, and you do get sucked in, or at least I did, even against my will (must have been that Queen of Diamonds in the lobby).  After leaving the theatre feeling oddly tarnished from my possible brain-washing experience, I decided that Hollywood should go all out and do some more sordid remakes.  Here are some of my suggestions in that department: The Ten Commandments (with Ryan Phillippe as Moses), Gone With The Wind (starring Ashton Kutcher as Rhett and Ashley Judd as Scarlett), and of course One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (with Anthony Michael Hall in the Nicholson part and Ally Sheedy as Nurse Ratched).  And while we're at it, how about True Grit remade as a Jackie Chan vehicle? There's no question Chan would look supremely dashing with the eye patch.",The Manchurian Candidate

The first half an hour may result a little bit confusing, but it's OK.Brainwashing inside the army of the USA, corruption in the arms industry... that's a nice plot. And since we can't bring out the originality of the story (because it's a remake), we can talk about the actors, they're just great: Denzel Washington is just perfect, as usual; Liev Schrieber is one of the best actor of his generation; and the biggest, the best...

67,TheNorthernMonkee,"decent, intense remake with one or two plot errors",8,25 November 2004,"SPOILERSOne thing which always combines to annoy countless film fans is the Hollywood obsession with remakes. Over the years, countless decent films (often staring Michael Caine) have been repeated in pathetic re-workings. Whether a ""reimagination"" (Tim Burton's atrocious 2001 version of ""Planet Of The Apes) or a complete word for word copy (Gus Van Sant's 1998 version of ""Psycho""), these remakes are often hopeless and leave fans of the originals seething with anger.On rare occasions, and these are very rare, a decent remake is actually achieved. 2004's reworking of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is an example of this.Relocated to modern America, this version of the story tells of Gulf War veteran Ben Marco (Denzel Washington playing the Frank Sinatra role). Experiencing nightmares from a major event during the war, Marco slowly begins to question his past memories and eventually encounters a corporation with eyes on Government.Removed from a time when America was terrified of a Russian invasion, this tale of corrupt politics is instead placed at a time when America is instead terrified of terrorism. With politicians and businesses exploiting this fear aspect to their own advantage, this film hits the right notes by tapping into very real fears and presenting us with a tale which feels possible.As Marco, the man who finds himself being questioned at every turn, Washington is superb. Looking intensely at the camera for moments at a time, Washington's performance displays a true sense of inner fear and confusion. On an opposing end of the scale, Meryl Streep as the obsessive mother of vice-president candidate Raymond Shaw (Liev Shreiber) manages to terrify with her apparent lack of fear and pure ruthless determination. A senator for years now, Streep's character Eleanor Shaw, is the perfect incarnation of any mother who went too far in trying to do what was best for her children.There are problems with ""The Manchurian Candidate"" however. Whilst it possesses two superb performances in the main roles, and for tension it is powerful stuff, it does contain one or two plot holes which never really are explained. These don't hold the film back really, but they do resurface an hour after viewing when the viewer thinks about the events of the film.All in all, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a powerful film. Whilst full of the occasional plot hole, it entertains and terrifies simultaneously. Often a huge mistake, this film has produced that by relocating a classic to a modern setting can be done very well. Definitely one to see, but be warned, you might come out of the cinema fearing for the world.",The Manchurian Candidate
68,FilmOtaku,"A pale comparison to the original, but an okay film",6,1 August 2004,"`The Manchurian Candidate', the story of paranoia, brainwashing and corruption in the United States government is certainly not entirely fresh. Nowadays, political thrillers are a dime a dozen, and it takes a truly great film to rise above the others.  Unfortunately, Jonathan Demme's remake of John Frankenheimer's 1962 original is okay, but falls short of greatness.Denzel Washington plays Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran who has been having the same horrifying dreams repeatedly since returning from overseas.  When he runs into a former member of his unit who tells him that he is having the same dreams, he begins to investigate.  Making his way through an intricate maze of deceit and intrigue, all signs point to the brainwashing of his unit in order to rewrite history in favor of Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a disliked member of their unit who is now a congressman and potential vice-presidential candidate whose mother (Meryl Streep) is so powerful and evil she makes Norman Bates' mom look like Donna Reed.  Marco has to uncover the mystery behind the dreams, connect all of the conspirators and stop an assassination attempt before it becomes too late.I have been told by several people that I cannot compare the remake to the original, but I have to disagree with that statement.  When a film is remade from an original, there are always going to be comparisons, and that is something that is to be expected; especially when remaking such an unmitigated classic as the 1962 original.  Demme's remake is a pale comparison to the original, hands down.  While updates were obviously needed, (the original dealt with Cold War paranoia) and there was actually one improvement from the original, (the enhancement of Rosie's character), other than some comparably good acting jobs, (Washington and Schreiber are great) the original film is a far superior film.  One major difference that I found between the two was the treatment of the dream sequence.  While watching the original, my blood turned cold as I sat watching Sinatra's (the original Marco) dream.  In the remake, Demme makes it look all slick, but the snippets that we do see are not remotely shocking.  Probably the most glaring difference, and most surprising one, are the endings.  I certainly didn't expect that a 42 year old film would have taken more risks than a modern one, but apparently Demme isn't immune to the Hollywood machine.  I was shocked at the end of the original, but first stifled a yawn, then was indignant at the end of the remake. An interesting story, yes.  And I don't have a lot to complain about Demme's stylistic offerings  he sticks to his point of view shots, extreme close-ups, and slick cinematography.  If you want to see the better of the two, or simply a phenomenal film, go to Frankenheimer's original.  As a stand-alone film, `The Manchurian Candidate' is average; not horrible, but not all that good either.  --Shelly",The Manchurian Candidate
69,EijnarAmadeus,Another very good movie from Denzel Washington,5,7 June 2005,"Though it doesn't have the coolness of Training Day or the spit-in-your-face attitude of Man On Fire, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a political thriller that holds very high standard all threw it's running time. Denzel Washington starring as a former soldier from the Desert Storm gets second thoughts about what happened to his crew back then.The movie do play on several classical thriller levels, that makes it all a bit easy to foresee, but again it's so professionally made, has got great acting, well made script and a good directing part. The storytelling works so good that it often tops itself, and especially the first 30 minutes are topnotch thriller. Though it looses a bit focus in it's way of excitement, it always keeps pressure on the right spots. The intensity is always there, and so THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE never misses what it aims after. Meryl Streep is very convincing in her character and together with Washington they make the movie a lot more interesting than time after time it actually is.It's not a typical everyday thriller, though it lights the matches that might seem like it is. Though these war - thrillers are often very cheesy and the un-necessarily violent, this one keeps it marks and what it promises. It may not be as good as the original from the 60ties, the movie delivers good stuff all the way. Denzel Washington himself being a fabulous actor does a great performance and there by this is another success from the actor.",The Manchurian Candidate
70,Son_of_Mansfield,"A flawed film, this Manchurian Candidate is still worth a meeting.",7,8 February 2007,"Top shelf cast and director are let down by a weak script that trades topicality for drama. The idea is a sound one. While the original was about the threat of other countries such as the Soviet Union and China, this new Candidate is about enemies from within with deep pockets who are trying to make money off of the deaths of Americans. A worthy topic and this is a great story to mold around it, but the writers should have layed off The X-files type twists that don't fit in a straight drama. The electronics in the film are never explained, they are just there as an ominous evil.Another problem is the simplicity of the script. It works, but the gravitas that the original has is missing as is the satire. The one scene that stands out is the scene where Meryl Streep explains why she killed Jordan in a calm manner. She is the weapon, programmed by manipulated patriotism and rampant capitalism. The rest of the time, the script resorts to cheap theatrics. This leaves Streep with the task of lending believability to one of the most ridiculous monologues, ""When men were forged in the desert, in the dark,"" she growls as she shakes her fist. It comes across as silly rather than satirical.The direction is partially to blame, it is lazy. There are none of the angled shots or full scenes like the original. About the only flourish is the white out that is used when Shaw is put into killing mode. Again, it is effective if unimpressive. The cast and crew survive this easily, but it isn't a high mark for any of them.",The Manchurian Candidate

They only good part was the performances. There really were no weak ones, Schreiber (the older one), Streep, Washington, everyone was very good but besides that, there is nothing about this film I liked.It feels very rushed and all over the place. The film is not short but still feels like a good hour of it was left on the cutting room floor since there are lots of elements in this that are set up and never followed up on later. Some characters are shown to be important but they have no screen time, it really feels like there is a good deep story down there somewhere, but the directing and editing is so messed up it's as good as buried. The resolution feels weak and not nearly dramatic enough.Tons of weird hard and soft cuts, plot inconsistencies and overall confusion.

72,bopdog,Brilliant entertainment. Terrifying cautionary tale. A must see for every citizen of the world today,10,23 November 2004,"Excellent movie! Oftentimes, high profile movies with big-name stars and 'serious' themes can be a bit pretentious. Dreary, even. But this movie is so good that it leaves all of that 'arty' and serious clumsiness behind.Denzel Washington once again shows his brilliance. He is truly one of the greatest actors of our time. Here he portrays an emotionally and spiritually wounded career Army officer with just the right note of humanity, confusion, and terror. He reacts and navigates through a (frighteningly) plausible scenario where the wheels have come off his world. The leaders and structure he had grown up trusting and serving have revealed themselves to be the real evil, the enemy we should all fear. Meryl Streep, another great actor, was spookily terrifying as 'Mother', the devil incarnate.The movie entertained, enthralled, and thrilled me at every turn. Further, the object lesson and cautionary tale it delivers makes this required viewing for everyone in the UK, the US, and the world. It is not a strict roman a clef, but it also wasn't hard to see many of our current leaders' actions and behaviors mirrored in the villainous plots. Go see it today--- enjoy yourself, but be prepared to be truly and deeply scared, especially as you read your morning newspapers and watch your nightly news on the telly!

73,Dan1863Sickles,"The Worst Remake I Have Ever Seen -- Dumber, Slower, Uglier than The Original",1,7 August 2004,"This movie is a truly vile, hateful and unnecessary dumbing down of a revered classic. With the exception of Liev Schrieber, who is a creditable Raymond Shaw, the entire cast is a disgrace. The direction is ugly, the film reeks of pointless blood, and at no time is it possible to either believe the plot or care about the characters. The most ghastly thing is that the movie is literal minded and actually copies from the original quite shamelessly. Too stupid or perhaps just too lazy to come up with anything new, shockmeister Jonathan Demme uses all the same killings, only he makes them into slasher movie gross outs instead of legitimate suspensful twists. Sometimes the results are just ugly, like when the test strangulations are replayed with lots of extra gagging and vomiting by the helpless victims. But sometimes the results are simply hilarious, as when Raymond Shaw's murder of Senator Jordan and his daughter is changed -- for absolutely no reason at all -- from a plausible scenario (handgun with a silencer, two fast shots) to a laughably impossible one (capsizing the kayak.) How exactly do you capsize a man's kayak and hold him under water? I suspect that the Senator would have whacked Raymond good with his paddle before he could ever tip the boat. Moreover, the frantic efforts of the daughter to reach her father are laughably stupid. If you see a guy holding your father's head under water for two minutes, you don't run down to the water unarmed yelling ""Raymond! Raymond!"" No, you either call the cops or pick up a baseball bat before you go anywhere near the guy. But this girl just walks right up to Raymond so he can drown her with no trouble at all.
Personally, I would have reshot the scene as a tribute to the end of RESERVOIR DOGS. Josie Jordan should just have done a very cool, controlled speech in the manner of Chris Penn's Nice Guy Eddie. ""Well, Raymond, it's been quite a long time. Yes, a lot of jobs. And you respect us and we respect you, but I guarantee I will shoot you right now if you don't stop HOLDING MY DADDY'S HEAD UNDER THE WATER!!!!""But what am I talking about?

Demme's films are usually thought-provoking as well as provocative, and some may not like that but i give him credit in directing 2 perfect films in Philadelphia and The Silence of the Lambs. As for this film, Manchurian candidate is the story of a vice presidential candidate (Schrieber) and the scandal in which he supposively saved his squadron from an Iraqi ambush, that might not have been what it seemed. A captain (Washington), questions the incident when an old major from that operation (Wright) approaches him and tells him of nightmares he has about what really happened in Kuwait. The film is directed well, although a bit long at times, and had some cliché dialogues, it is written and directed well for the most part. The acting is also quite good, especially Denzel and Meryl Streep who both give great Oscar-caliber performances. Only disappointment for me was Liev Schrieber who i found a little bit wooden and thought that character could have been acted better, also Jon Voigt was a bit wasted, although Jeffrey Wright was great for his little screen-time. All-in-all, not a terribly a original thriller, but is a good one, the writing had some glitches, however i assume the 1962 original was written better, anyhow, my rating is 8/10. #164 on my list of all time favorite films",The Manchurian Candidate
75,sashank_kini-1,MC is more of MS- Meryl Streep in a malevolent role but a stupendous performance,9,16 February 2011,"Its quite common for sequels and remakes to be unfairly trashed. Even though the film may not have the 'Best Picture' charm, its quite a chiller for a thriller. MC garments its revelatory scenes in quite a disturbing, spine-chilling fashion, using pauses and muteness to grab the audience's mind. Liev handles the quite complex character well, a brainwashed, beguiled character who climbs the political ladder because of his mother's influences and complicity with various organizations and the Army. Though the idea here (I haven't managed to watch the original) seems broadly far-fetched (all this to reach the pinnacle of the political ladder) and I have heard that some portion related to terrorism was skimmed off which does somewhat mitigate the impact of the movie, the film is bricked with fine, intelligent performances, and a sense of anticipation. Meryl Streep is quite a gem of an actress. I cannot understand the hate towards her performance by some of the reviewers here. She's probably the only actress the only actress who, if given a chance to play a man, would portray it so naturally that she'll snag the Oscar for Best Actor! She's as hilarious as NIcki Minaj when she impersonates another person derisively. For example, in the beginning when she enters her son's office, she makes a passing reference of the secretary. In a split of a second, she changes her voice to sound like the teller and she's spot on. Another scene where she says, about her father, ""My father, Tyler Prentiss, never asked, ""Is this okay? Is this okay?"" she again makes it sound distinctive. What I mean is short is that I am overwhelmed by the effort put by her to make her character impeccably immaculate. I don't think any other actresses recently would have made the character so vivid and enriching and not succumbing to clichés, like some other actressy ones would. Meryl brings to us the face we would get on the television news channels, a character who appearance and behavior in public is quite different (and her different by light-years) from her candid one. She sounds like one of her male counterparts (e.g. Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando) when she speaks a monologue, something that's quite miraculous for a lady especially because in many movies, even strong actresses fail to make the impact that a character should when portraying a strong, forthright one (when I compare Julia's performance in Erin to this, this simply outweighs Erin because of sheer experience and a better understanding of the character) The tone with which she speaks is something that holds your attention, some others have got screechy or mundane when doing the same. Every dialogue is carefully appraised but she still manages to get as natural as possible. The virility, greed, manipulation, command, self-centeredness that she breathes through her character is the work of a very strong veteran. And I'm saying all this because I'm quite flabbergasted by the lack of recognition she received for this performance. For me, it's the best element in the movie. Denzel's character is quite sober yet persistent, but his acting towards the end is overdone to the tee (when his character flips out). But the continuous confusion and disillusionment is finely done. Every scene, his character evolves as the truth slowly surfaces. That's perhaps the reason why he sounds so manic himself but the acting could've toned down a bit. (I'm talking about the scene with Thomas Jordan's character). Another under-rated performance is crisply done by Kimberly, who seems quite talented herself. The movie is more about the depredation of human mind in a quest for fame and glory. Eleanor uses her own son as pawn to kill a leader, quite a egregious and malevolent thing to do as the consequences of being caught would've been very critical. She pulls quite a couple of strings and is very ambitious, to the extent of being a psychotic monomaniac. Again , the film is uplifted by Meryl and I can't but repeat myself time and again how fabulous she is. The plot is quite complex and is transcended to screen without losing much sheen. 8.5 on 10.",The Manchurian Candidate
76,lawprof,"The New and Unimproved ""Manchurian Candidate"": A Stealth ""Fahrenheit 9/11?""",6,30 July 2004,"The just released techno-polemic (a new genre), ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" isn't a remake in the sense that recent movies such as ""The Italian Job,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" or ""Oceans Eleven"" largely copy their predecessors (for better or worse). Loosely following Richard Condon's novel, on which the first movie was based, this version sacrifices the former flick's chilling story development to today's audience-demanded bizarre science experiments with a gloating mad doctor and the usual contemporary thriller's fast and frequent action scenes.The original Manchurian Candidate came out when the Cold War threatened to become very hot, fear of the U.S.S.R. and its satellites was great and Americans still hadn't digested the reality of Korean War G.I. turncoats who had been brainwashed, a new, fearful threat in a rapidly changing human landscape.The cast in the first film was superb and those who only know Angela Lansbury as a slightly dotty mystery-author sleuth on TV should become acquainted with her performance as a mom with a mission - to make her little boy President of the United States: by hook, crook or a sniper's rifle.In the earlier film there is much evil but it emanates from warped souls supported by foreign enemies very familiar to that day's moviegoer. Like ""Seven Days in May,"" a near contemporary of ""The Manchurian Cndidate,"" some might evilly forsake the Constitution's strictures but in the end the system stands strong because it's inherently good.In the pseudo-remake the American political system and its dependence on money from a vast industrial conglomerate clearly putting profit before patriotism is hoisted to the forefront and relentlessly indicted. The villainous octopus here is ""Manchurian Global,"" an outfit having no small resemblance to...what's the name of the outfit where the current Veep made his millions? Halitosis, Halli...something.Anyway we have a patriotic, tough but psychically wounded vet of the first Gulf War, Army MAJ Ben Marks who seems to have been off his meds for a while. A captain during the conflict, he's only one grade higher a dozen years later, sure proof that's he isn't a highly rated officer. He survived an attack on his unit which disappeared for three days before being found sans two men presumed KIA. An enlisted man with an impressive family pedigree, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber, very effective here) supposedly saved the unit from utter destruction for which Marks submitted a Medal of Honor recommendation. Backed up by the surviving soldiers' stories, he gets the nation's highest heroism award.Fast forward to the present when he's a New York congressman with a hell of a Mommy Dearest, Meryl Streep as Senator Eleanor Shaw. She's determined to see him as her party's vice-presidential candidate and she succeeds. Always a fine actress, in this role she's largely wasted, at least when compared to Angela Lansbury. Where Lansbury showed an incandescently cold determination, this Senator Shaw seems on the verge of offering her beloved son chicken soup or access to her bed or both.Marks begins to vaguely remember things and as his recollection returns those helping him start disappearing while he becomes the object of, first, investigation and then attempted neutralization. Fortunately he has a Gal Friday, Rosie, played by the not especially talented Kimberly Elise. Anyone who can't figure out early how HER part is going to develop should be barred from movie theater concession stands for a year.The ending isn't so different from the first movie but what is presented here is a continuing, raw indictment of the American political process. Marks never stops being angry once he suspects that the system isn't on the up and up and he tries to get the audience to share his simmering and, eventually, boiling over rage. Instead of a foreign enemy using an unrealistic model of an existing and rarely effective mind control approach, we have all kinds of diabolical inventions with, of course, an evil mastermind for audiences that need something less subtle than that found in the wonderful initial filmization of the novel.Overall, Washington's strong performance notwithstanding, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is a Message-Film Mess. Partisans of Bush, Kerry and even Nader will leave the theater...unchanged.If you haven't seen the original (which was pulled from distribution following JFK's assassination), please rent or buy it. 6/10",The Manchurian Candidate
77,movieguy1021,The Manchurian Candidate: 7/10,7,31 July 2004,"Unlike what most people say, remakes are not always unwelcome. Although some of them are completely uncalled for (like Jonathan Demme's remake of Charade called The Truth About Charlie), some are unnecessary but worthy (like Demme's The Manchurian Candidate). The 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate starred Frank Sinatra as a veteran of the Korean war who believes that he and his squadron have been brainwashed for political purposes. This 2004 update stars Denzel Washington as Sinatra's character, but inserting the Gulf War in instead of the Korean. Instead of communists brainwashing them, it's a corporation (cinema's favorite whipping boy) set out to control the USA. Playing Angela Lansbury's chilling role is Meryl Streep, who (despite many people believing it to be a parody of Hilary Clinton) doesn't have as much screen time as Lansbury did, and ends up not having enough time to make the impact that the character had in the first.I'm going to try to keep comparisions to the original to a bare minimum here. I'll just this one solely on itself. Although it doesn't have the dramatic impact of the first (can't even get through a sentence without a comparision!), the new one still was entertaining, although it wasn't chilling at all. The classic scene (which most people know about) in the first (there I go again!) is nowhere represented here. Instead, it's just briefly shown in flashbacks, and with nowhere near the impact and the awe. But that doesn't mean that the movie wasn't entertaining. It's a bit slow, but I wanted to see how much it would change. It's changed all right, but to fit in with the modern times of today. It's not a travesty like most other remakes. It's pretty faithful (and even keeps in the throwaway character of Rosie) and works throughout.It wasn't a heartpounding movie like the ads would have you say (or the original would have you believe), but it's an interesting movie to watch nonetheless. Demme redeems himself with an interesting directing style and not ruining a classic movie, like he did previously. Washington also redeems himself from Man on Fire with a different role, one that an actor of such caliber can do. He does his role subtlely yet brilliantly. Liev Schreiber, as the title character, does a great job, although I think Lawrence Harvey did a better job in the first. Same with Streep and Lansbury. Although Streep said she didn't watch the other film until she was done shooting, it's evident that she's basing her role off of Lansbury's.So what did i just say in three long, incomprehensible paragraphs? Basically, I said that the original was better. I would recommend this remake of The Manchurian Candidate if you wish. It certainly is no classic, but it's entertaining and engaging, and what's wrong with that?My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence and some language.",The Manchurian Candidate
78,museumofdave,Meryl vs. Angela: A Hands-Down Toss-Up in Riveting Conspiracy Thriller,7,18 May 2013,"One can watch Hitchcock's Psycho again and again even knowing the plot, as the seemingly simple style combine with surprising and brilliantly quirky performances to create a memorable experience. Because I know and admire the original and unsettling Manchurian Candidate, the plot surprises in the competent remake are telegraphed, and even though the theme of an American president controlled by corporate forces is more than timely, it was hard for me to get personally involved in the convoluted story.That said, Meryl Streep has a grand time essaying The Mother From Hell, and Liev Schreiber plays her zombie-like spawn with more conviction than boring Laurence Harvey did in the original. who merely seemed to be type-cast. My recommendation: if you haven't seen the original, this can be an excellent conspiracy thriller, as the craftsmanship is exceptional, and it is tightly pulled together; if you are an old fan of the original, the disorienting shivers won't be there, but it's still interesting as a comparison, and it's a well-made construct.",The Manchurian Candidate

What I mean is that the films that really wowed you as a kid, well, kids get wowed by anything. Go back and look at Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest, it's sort of a stale black and white humdrum action flick now that 40 years have passed.The only criticism I might make of the Manchurian Candidate is that the reasons behind the conspiracy are not made clear. Who should see this film:-- Everyone, except art snobs, but stop voting on IMDb, you're screwing it up for the regular people like me.I'll give The Manchurian Candidate a near-perfect 9 out of 10, vastly underrated as is The Siege by the way.",The Manchurian Candidate

81,MichaelMargetis,Surprisingly Better Than the Original!,8,2 April 2005,"It would be more likely for me to get hit by a bolt of lightning on my way to the grocery store, than it would be for a remake to supersedes it's original film. That said, let me start off this review on a positive note. The 2004 version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is better than the 1962 original, directed by the late great John Frankenheimer. Although some will not agree (this is a bold statement), I will stick strongly by this theory. Moving on...The film very smoothly adapts from 1962 to 2004. Instead of the Korean war, it's Desert Storm. The story of both versions centrals around a squad stationed in a war, and one guy saving everybody. However, he does not. The government brainwashes him (along with everyone else in the squad), makes him look good for the tabloids and cameras, and gets him to run for vice president, so they can get a ""sleeper"" into the white house. All this is advised by the guy's mother (once played by Murder She Wrote's Angela Lansbury), a harsh senator with ruthless ambition who bares a striking resemblance to that witch Hilary Clinton. However ,the general of the squad starts having nightmares about what really went on that night in battle, and threatens the future presidency of the ""brainwashed"" and mind-controlled mamma's boy.One of Manchurian Candidate's strong points is the crisp adapted script. It drags a little in the middle (I half yawned), but those last fifteen minutes of the film will have you admiring every letter the screenwriters typed onto paper. I won't give away the ending to you, but it will definitely surprise you. There is a lot of thrilling moments in Manchurian Candidate, which lacked in the original 1962 version. The dialogue flows exceptionally well, and the direction provided by Jonathon Demme (director of Silence of the Lambs, and brother to the late Ted Demme) is simply marvelous.The strongest aspect of Manchurian Candidate is the astounding acting. Meryl Streep definitely gives the performance of the film. She does such an admirable job as a cut throat politician, she makes Academy Award Nominee Martin Sheen's performance int he West Wing look like Keanu Reeves' performance in Little Buhda. Streep will definitely receive her eighth Academy Award Nomination for her work in this (books closed). It's utterly amazing how much better she tackles the role of Eleanor Shaw than Angela Lansbury (although she was very good too), it's INCREDIBLE. Denzel Washington gives a better performance than Frank Sinatra in the original by far, and I have to say I was beyond impressed with Liev Shrieber's career groundbreaking performance as vice president nominee Raymond Prentiss Shaw. Only up until three hours ago did I acknowledge him as one of the best 20-something-year-old actors today. Even though Shrieber isn't as excellent as Laurence Harvey (who originally had the role in the 1962 version), he creates this wonderful in depth character, that only truly talented performers can pull off. If Liev Schrieber plays his cards right he may get his first ever Oscar nomination, along with the (in my opinion) most talented actress of all time, Meryl Streep. Denzel Washington will be skipped for a nomination this year, because his work in this is the least impressive out of the three main players.The supporting cast is mostly strong, with bit parts played by actors like the Midnight Cowboy himself, Jon Voight, and Dean Stockwell as the president of Manchurian Global, the company funding the mind control of Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Live Shrieber's character). The Golden Globe winning Jeffrey Wright from HBO's acclaimed miniseries Angels in America, does a pitch perfect job as a emotionally distressed soldier dealing with the terrors of war. Miguel Ferrer has a tiny part as a anal retentive a-hole (big surprise there) and Vera Farminga is very creepy as the British scientist behind the ghastly plans of Manchurian Global. The only disappointment of the cast is Kimberly Elise (playing the role of Psycho's Janet Leigh in the 1962 original film). She isn't just not good, she's terrible. She is absolutely awful, and almost every scene she is featured in she ruins the dramatic mood, by her dreadful acting skills. Tom Cruise must have taught her to act. They really could of cast any other twenty-something-year old African-American female to do a better job. Hell, even my dog Prudence could have given a better performance that Kimberly Elise. Even though she is surrounded by enormous amounts of talent, she really shits on the movie whenever she can.So in closing, I highly recommend The Manchurian Candidate, despite it's minimal flaws.

83,majikstl,Running out of time...,4,9 September 2004,"Let's start with the title. Had the film been called A MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, rather than THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, it might have made some sense. After all, the term ""Manchurian candidate"" has something of a generic quality to it now, thanks to the classic status of the original 1962 film by John Frankenheimer. As is, the name Manchurian is justified in Jonathan Demme's slick, shallow remake only by the invention of the name ""Manchurian Global,"" chosen for the film's evil corporation. Which should make you wonder what kind of multinational capitalistic behemoth would name itself after an impoverished region of the largest existing Communist nation in the world.It may be a small matter, but contriving the name Manchurian Global is symptomatic of the way the whole film is conceived. The original film had a certain sense of urgency, even if that urgency was built on paranoia. The film's paranoia had a double edge: It recognized the real and/or imagined threat of Communism, but it also was a challenge to the powers of the anti-Communist forces of the McCarthy era and, in its boldest conceit, theorized that they were virtually one in the same. Two extremist views feeding off the same fear. In the new film, the villainous force isn't Communism, but capitalism, or more specifically, a vaguely defined corporate entity that hopes to rule the world. As such, in giving us a generic corporate villain, the film has all the gravity of a James Bond adventure. The change is revealing in that it shows the political correctness of Hollywood thinking (in not wishing to slur any ethnic group, or for that matter any specific political party), plus it shows the lack of creative thinking in Hollywood (by playing it safe and trite with the usual stereotypical band of rich, white, male Western capitalists as the baddies). If nothing else, the change of the focus of the film only serves to reveal just why the remake is so unnecessary. If the only logical villain is a contrived, generic one, then really, there is no logical villain at all. Plus, the whole plot is rendered silly. Both films are built around a far-fetched plot involving kidnapping, brainwashing and assassination as part of a scheme to place a sleeper in the White House; a covert, controllable puppet of the bad guys. If the president were to be a closet communist, the implications, though implausible, at least offer possibilities. But in the Demme version, we are expected to believe in an elaborate plot designed to get a pro-business candidate elected to the presidency. Huh? As if, most Republican weren't already pro-business and a good deal of the Democrats weren't just as easily swayed by a few fat campaign donations. There are already more than enough possible candidates that it is silly to think that a conglomerate would have to manufacture one against his will to do their bidding. I mean, why build what you can already buy off the rack? Frankenheimer's film was satirical, surrealistic and sometimes down right wacky. Its daring attitude and occasional flirtations with being absurd, found the 1962 version constantly running the risk of being just plain silly. But its grimly playful sense of humor instead made it seem alive as well as providing a commentary on the nature of political warfare. The new version is as serious as it is soulless. Much like he did with THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE, Demme's pointless remake of CHARADE, he has managed to drain the humor out of the material and thus misses the point entirely. Where the original saw serious matters with a gleeful eye just shy of DR. STRANGELOVE, the remake treats the trivial with solemn intensity. For instance, the film belabors the explanation of what constitutes brainwashing (via implanted microchips), obviously thinking the idea is too complex for its simple-minded audience -- despite the fact that brainwashing has been part of popular mythology for over half a century. Demme works to cross the T's and dot the I's, even though many of the T's and I's aren't all that necessary in the first place. Arguably, the actors in this remake are better than the actors in the original, or at least Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber give more nuanced and complex performances. Yet, better isn't necessarily better. Frank Sinatra's Capt. Marco was a troubled man, who still was in control, he grounded the film; Washington's Marco is progressively more unstable and somehow less satisfying as a-man-no-one-will-believe cliché. Schreiber, who even looks a little like a baby-faced Laurence Harvey, plays Raymond with a gentle vulnerability, which would make him appealing as the would-be candidate, but it was Harvey's unrelenting nastiness that made it so ironic in the original that he ultimately became both heroic and sympathetic. This film begs you to like Raymond Shaw; the previous one dared you to. Even Kimberly Elise, whose Rosie is now an intricate part of the story, lacks that cool charm and dry humor of Janet Leigh's mysterious and ultimately irrelevant character in the first film. The characters have been rewritten, but not reenergized. Streep, with the thankless job of trying to fill the iconic shoes of Angela Lansbury, gives her character a controlled ruthlessness that is perfectly believable; but lacking that mix of cold-blooded ruthlessness and cheerfully vicious opportunism that made Lansbury's performance a classic. Streep gives a fine performance; Lansbury gave a unique performance. Plus, by making Streep an actual Senator -- logical, given the times -- her power is made obvious and the character is the weaker for it. Lansbury, on the other hand, was playing Lady Macbeth, a power behind the throne whose dominance was all the more frightening because it was unexpected, inexplicable, yet unquestioned. To their credit, the filmmakers have tried to follow the blueprint of the original film, while still adding twists and clever surprises to make the story different, if not fresh. Unfortunately, many, if not all, of the changes don't work or don't improve anything. Despite a reasonable effective start the film begins a downward arc, right up to a twist-upon-a-twist ending that makes the unlikely plot seem simply stupid. It says something when you end a film with a political assassination and still can't generate suspense. And it doesn't help that the convention and rally sequences all look totally fake. Some films are simply products of their times; they don't translate to different eras. Frankenheimer's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one; it plays as fresh and exciting today as it did them, but it is nonetheless an artifact of the Cold War era. It tells us something about America, circa 1950-1965. All Demme's CANDIDATE tells us about 21st century America is that Hollywood has gotten lazy.",The Manchurian Candidate
84,hokeybutt,Here's An Idea... Start Re-making BAD Movies... Then You Won't Suffer By Comparison,4,7 August 2004,"THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (2 outta 5 stars)Not a terrible movie... but ultimately you have to come to realize that it's just another pointless remake. Denzel Washington inherits the earlier Frank Sinatra role as an ex-military man who comes to realize that the bad dreams he and his fellow vets are having may in fact be something horrific that really happened to them during the war. He realizes that something really big may be up involving an old friend who is poised to become the next Vice President of the United States. There is a kind of interesting plot twist that wasn't in the original film... but it hardly justifies the remake's existence. In every way (casting, dialogue, plot, suspense) this movie falls way behind its 1964 predecessor. Denzel's character is never clearly defined... sometimes he seems to be rational and in control of his actions (even though the conclusions he comes to might seem crazy to outsiders) and other times he's acting like a psycho. Meryl Streep has a lot of fun with her role as the tough, ambitious mother who might love her son a little TOO much... I really wanted to see more of her relishing the role of villainess.Liev Schreiber is adequate but unspectacular as the pawn in a game too big for him to even conceive. Sloppy direction by Jonathan Demme... lots of flashy, quick-cutting... but no real style or cohesion. After this and ""The Truth About Charlie"" I think it's time he got out of the re-make business.

Seventeen years after the Gulf War, Captain Ben Marco {Denzel Washington} is haunted by dreams revolving his platoon mate Raymond Shaw {Schreiber}, a war hero that is being groomed as the Vice Presidential candidate by his mother, Senator Eleanor Shaw {Meryl Streep}. As he tries to get answers, Marco learns of a political conspiracy that involves the Manchurian Global corporation and their devious plans for Shaw if he wins the election. The plot of the film is very intriguing and the execution is done very well. I have never seen the original but after watching this movie I definitely want to check it out as I have been told that the original is a classic. But I don't really see why there was a point in remaking it but they did a very good job. The actors all do a terrific job with Meryl Streep stealing the movie as Eleanor Shaw. Denzel Washington plays the captain well and Liev Schreiber does a very good job as Raymond Shaw and he is a very underrated actor. The direction is good as Jonathon Demme has now redeemed himself for remaking Charade. I can't believe the rating for this film is only a 6.7 as this film deserves much higher. There are some chilling moments in this film and some twists that I didn't see coming. The script has some holes in it as it leaves some unanswered questions but other then that the movie is pretty good. With a top notch director and cast this movie is very good and while it may not be the best movie of the year its still worth watching.

This one stars Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, has some minor and some major differences, but is still about a group of marines captured in battle (this time Guelph) and supposedly brainwashed.Everyone thinks that Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) fought off the enemy and saved the troops, leading them after three days to safety, but Bennet Marco (Denzel Washington) suspects brainwashing because he has strange nightmares about something different that happened those three days, nightmares that some of the other troops are having. The dreams involve Shaw taking orders from some strange villains and killing the two troops that supposedly died in the battle. But Shaw is now a vice presidential candidate, and Marco has quite a challenge trying to convince anyone of this.Thrown in are Senator Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep), Raymond's mother, who obviously is more than she seems, Senator Thomas Jordan (Jon Voight) a pretty good man whose been bumped out of the vice presidential race by Shaw and Rosie (Kimberly Elise), a nice young woman who Marco meets on a train. As Marco investigates further he becomes more and more shaky and paranoid, as conspiracy theorists always do in movies.The movie is basically the same as the original, up until the last twenty minutes or so, which is still basically the climax of the original film with some of the characters reversed. I knew most of what was gonna happen, which I guess took away from it for me, so I may have been more excited and involved if I hadn't seen the '62 version, instead of just waiting for it to end. Of course, between the two movies, I'm still glad I took the first.The '62 version was a masterpiece; it was one of the most exciting, fun, dramatic thrillers I've ever seen; one of the best. It had flair, energy, humor, and was elevated by the powerhouse performances of Sinatra, Lansbury and Lawrence Harvey. It was intriguing, we leaned forward at every twist, but it also had style. The original film had one of the first martial arts fight scenes seen in history (and one of the best). In the original, Shaw would snap into a trance whenever someone said 'How 'bout you past the time by playing a little solitaire', and he'd follow orders whenever he saw a red queen.Both these elements are absent from this version, there's no time for solitaire and style when you have to shock the audience. That's more what this version is trying, for instance, the Al Melvin character in this film is insane, he draws disturbing drawings and shakes and stutters, whereas the Melvin character in the first was just a regular guy. There are so many scenes in this film trying to shock you or creep you out: a man gets drilled in the head, a man is shot in the head, Marco has some strange visions, he cuts a chip out of his shoulder, lots of blood and heavy breathing.The first film was shocking too, but in a more subtler, quieter way. There were some really frightening and creepy scenes, but it didn't take itself too seriously, in a way it was satire. This version takes itself way to serious, it's not fun, and it's arduous.The writing is pretty poor too. The first film was shorter than this one, but still had enough time to establish its characters and deal with the conspiracy. The characters here, with the exception of maybe Streep's, are all one-dimensional and just work as tools for the plot. It tries to create characters, but it fails. We cared deeply for Harvey because we knew him, but we hardly get to know Schreiber, so we kind of welcome his dilemma because we want to see the plot progress (and the movie to end).Washington, Schreiber and Voight are all magnificent actors, and their performances aren't bad, but they don't have enough material for us to care about them. Streep's character is written the best, and her performance is well executed. There's a scene where she is in a room with a bunch of campaign workers, ordering them around as they all stare in wonder, and we wonder if its is Streep or Shaw that they are admiring (or both?). Because of Streep's endless qualities as an actress she is completely believable as a domineering, powerful, confident politician (and mother).And there were some other parts I liked, the cinematography was pretty good, Streep was fantastic, the climax was exciting, and Washington's character has some good moments (like when he punches a federal agent whose taunting him). But it still lacks everything that made the original exciting. The original was fun to watch, this film is more of a task.But, if you haven't seen the original you may enjoy it, 6.5/10.",The Manchurian Candidate
88,kgprophet,Not as Good as the Original,5,14 August 2004,"Whenever you endeavour to remake a classic film,  you have to put something new and interesting into it.  I was excited at seeing Jonathan Demme's take on this political thriller. Such as  ""Silence of the Lambs"", he has the ability to tell an exciting suspense story.  Denzel Washington is adept at playing the part of the investigator like he did in ""Pelican Brief"" and ""Courage Under Fire"".  Liev Schreiber was also an appropriate choice as the candidate.  His face reveals the character's inner complexities. This felt like a stage play,  with no real attempt to adapt the original screenplay,  except to emphasise some aspects and de-emphasise others.  The subplot where Shaw has a summer fling with his opponent's daughter is only alluded to.  The villain has been updated but the audio and visual cues are a little over the top.  After the third mention of Manchurian Global being the code-word for Halliburton, we get the point.  And the frequent TV news graphics do more than get the point across that we are being brainwashed with slogans. Streep is fine as the over bearing mother,  but no better than Lansbury did in the original.  The twist at the end is only nuanced a little differently than the original.  The only stand out difference with Demme's production is the love interest played by Kimberly Elise.  Her character keeps you guessing at what is going on behindWashington's back.  Otherwise, it seems like we've been through the political thriller genre cliches.  Men in shadows,  evil looking bad guys,  fake smiles, nobody is who they seem.  Kudos to Demme for casting Robyn Hitchcock as one of the weirdos. Biggest letdown is the brainwashing scenes.  The great detail and care Frankenheimer put into those scenes are treated more coarsely in this one.  A dimension of implants this time around seems to only confuse.  **MINOR SPOILER**     Washington removes an implant,  but it makes no difference when the bad guys trigger his programming later.  Shaw gets an implant update,  why?  Everybody else got there's when they were abducted.  **END SPOILER**It thought it would be a nice angle to get to know the other members of the company that were abducted,  see how the other members were affected.  Demme chooses to concentrate quite squarely on Washington.  Although his performance is terrific,  we lose some dimension into the story as the greater aspects unfold.  I think Demme did not improve the formula for this film,  and felt it could have been better.I give it a 6 out of 10.",The Manchurian Candidate
89,CelluloidRehab,Remake Remake Remake !!!,5,31 July 2004,"There is nothing wrong with a remake, so long as it enhances or retells the story adequately. In this case, this movie tries some new things (considering things have changed since 1962). To put it simply, where the original was a psychological, political thriller this movie is an action movie posing as a psychological thriller. It stands as a decent movie in its own right, just not a very good one. This movie is there to remind us just how well done the original was. Denzel Washington does a pretty good job of pulling off Major Marco, except that Marco is now a full blown conspiracy nut. Denzel is now in the same league as William Shatner. Where Shatner seemed to include, in his contract, that he must have at least one shirtless scene, so it would seem that Denzel has done the same. Other than Denzel, the rest of the cast is almost non-existent. Liev Shrieber (Raymond Shaw) is as stiff and flat as any high school performer. His relationship with his mother (Meryl Streep), with Marco and with the Jordans' is non-existent. There is no character development for them. We are just suppose to take for granted that something is there. Brainwashing. That is underlying story of both the movies. The original did not hide that fact. It was evident in the first 10 minutes of the movie. This movie does not. At the beginning of the movie, we are not aware that anything has happened. Marco could actually be a complete nutcase, based on the way the brainwashing is revealed. One has to wait almost to end to get an idea of what really happened. The focus of the movie is not on the circumstances and reasons behind the brainwashing, but rather the brainwashing itself. It becomes the center piece, especially with all the graphic scenes. Even the doctor who performs the brainwashing gives out a dull, flat performance. Is he maniacal, is he enjoying what he's doing ?? Hard to tell. Even the way the brainwasher is activated is lame. They simply call him, and repeat to him his own full name. How boring is that ? There are some interesting parts to the movie, but for the most part is seems incomplete or rushed. If you're going to do a remake, try to do a better job than this attempt. Better yet, take Roger Corman out of the cast and place him behind the camera. It might actually have helped. Stick to the original, it was a much better effort than this. Wait for this movie to hit the video store or cable to watch it.",The Manchurian Candidate

What if the leaders of today are just mere puppets, used for private agendas by corporate companies..or is it already happening??Tonight's movie is the psychological political thriller remake The Manchurian Candidate (2004) starring my man Denzel Washington as Ben Marco who served as a Captain during the Gulf War in Kuwait is now back in civilian life and is retelling his story about the war to a local boy scouts about how the heroics of Sergeant Raymond Shaw who apparently saved him the majority of the unit. It is later known that Shaw receives the Medal of Honour due to his heroic act and is a likely candidate as Vice-President.Marco gets a surprise visit from a member of his platoon. This triggers something into Marco mind. And soon more problems occur for Marco, he has recurring nightmares that it was Shaw who killed the men and that all of the men in the platoon were kidnapped and experimented. Marco investigates this and confronts Shaw about what really happened and finds out that Shaw too has recurring dreams of that incident. Before he can find out more Marco is arrested by the orders of Shaw's ruthless ice queen mother Senator Eleanor Shaw played by Meryl Streep. Relentlessly driven to find the truth and rebuffed by Shaw and the Army about what really happened and why he is having the same dream. Marco starts investigating the puzzles missing. He soon finds out that his unit was brainwashed by a multi-national corporation with mind-control implants and are to design who the new world leader is to be.Great performances by the main cast, where Meryl Streep channels through an ambitious Lady Macbeth style and dangerous mother who will stop at nothing for her son to be the future leader, even if it means to brainwash him and her brilliant turn to make psychotic decisions that are instructed to her son. Denzel gives a great interpretation of a man who feel like he is controlled yet doesn't know who and what is controlling him and feels like the more he digs up the pieces, the more he will understand why he was brain washed and what's his real purpose in the charade. Is he himself a sleeper agent?The movie is a clever take on paranoia for conspiracy theorists. What lacks in the film however is the script and the length of the film..it should have been wayyy shorter. Yes it does have thrills about how a multi-national corporation is to place their own sleeper in the White House however its the script and the direction that fails the film. The acting is great by everyone, however, there are major plot holes which kinda sucks since the movie was long as and would have been ideal if it was covered rather than filming scenes which really could have been filmed shorter. What lacks is the answers for audience including some of the dreams and the pictures brought in the film that are never addressed including the covered Muslim women, the Doctor Noyle issue and who was brainwashed by whom? The ending was wayyy to flat and felt rushed which was a letdown since it was a lengthy film. Overall 7.2/10.",The Manchurian Candidate
91,The_Core,What has happened to Hollywood?,5,22 January 2005,"Given the first 15 or so minutes, I was expecting an excellent film. Unfortunately, it turned out to be completely lacking in suspense and at times even boring. The story was a complete rehash of a dozen other films, and there was never any real sense of tension or danger lurking. The only redeeming factor was Denzel Washington's acting (always excellent) and Meryl Streep's utterly creepy performance as Eleanor Shaw. She seemed to be channeling the worst of Hillary Clinton's public persona.Where have all the good screenwriters gone? In the past five years (since the DVD format became the rage), Hollywood has degenerated into purely a moneymaking machine. Apparently there's little money to be made at the box office compared to the proceeds that the DVDs bring in later, and the quality of movies has suffered greatly as a result. Sadly, The Manchurian Candidate 2004 is yet another example of the empty-headed Hollywood marketing machine.5/10",The Manchurian Candidate
92,anhedonia,"Better than most remakes, but not as compelling as the original",6,2 August 2004,"Here's something I never thought I'd say: I enjoyed parts of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" remake; it isn't as bad as I expected it to be.
And much of the credit goes to the three main players - Denzel Washington as the paranoid veteran, Liev Schreiber as the titular character and Meryl Streep as the power-hungry, Oedipally motivated Senator Eleanor Shaw.
Screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris reinvent and contemporize Richard Condon's novel and the 1962 film. While John Frankenheimer's film, written by George Axelrod, was the apotheosis of the Cold War thriller and a scathing indictment of McCarthyism, Jonathan Demme's remake is less subtle in its approach and paranoia, but takes barbed jabs at current politics, the corruptibility of our elected leaders and paranoia disguised as patriotism in a post-9/11 America.The remake also owes a debt of gratitude to Alan J. Pakula's brilliant 1974 paranoia-conspiracy thriller, ""The Parallax View.""Although it isn't clear whether Raymond Shaw is a Republican or Democrat - his mother certainly seems more Republican in her outlook and politics - Demme and his writers' point is that all American politicians are bought and paid for by big business. As we all know, we never heeded President Eisenhower's prescient caution about the military industrial complex.The villainous Manchurian Global clearly was inspired by Halliburton - there's even mention of the company getting no-bid contracts. Pay close attention and you'll hear pointed references about the use of private contractors by the military, malfunctioning touch-screen voting machines and our government's ""compassionate vigilance."" Also, look fast and you'll see a news crawl about a Wal-Mart-type chain and a newspaper story about our treatment of Muslims.Washington's awfully convincing as a man fraying at the edges, whose grip on reality seems to be slowly slipping, and there were a few moments where Schreiber almost reminded me of Laurence Harvey. Streep, on the other hand, proves why she is undoubtedly the best actress this nation has ever produced. Her Eleanor spits venom. We're utterly convinced why Raymond's such a cuckold. We can only imagine what his poor father must have endured. Streep occasionally comes close to being campy, but so completely dominates the screen that she scares us even when she chews ice.But several other talented actors, including Jon Voight, Vera Farmiga, Dean Stockwell and Ted Levine, are used to little or no effect.
Some crucial plot elements make no sense. The Dr. Noyle scenario, for instance, proves to be illogical, especially when we learn more about him. Neither Pyne nor Georgaris attempted to rectify this deficiency. Also, the mysterious Muslim women are superfluous. I wonder if their bit wound up on the cutting-room floor.The film contains an unmistakable cynical tone. As much as it's clearly an indictment of big business' control of politics, it also denounces our leaders' insistence on keeping the public on edge with terror alerts. And as Senator Shaw points out, ""The assassin always dies. It's necessary for the national healing.""But after maintaining its cynicism for much of the film, it comes apart completely at the end. Demme and his writers cop out with a pointless and weak denouement. That gunshot you hear is Demme shooting himself in the foot.It's almost as if they gave in to appease some mindless preview audience or dimwitted studio hack. Or, maybe they envisioned it just like this. Given my admiration of Demme, I'd like to think otherwise. Hope I'm right.",The Manchurian Candidate
93,oshram-3,Effective updating of an excellent film,7,31 July 2004,"I've both seen the original version of this film and read the novel, so I'm fairly familiar with the story. This new remake twists it on its ear, however, so it's really more of an inspired by' than a remake per se. That being said, this new Manchurian is a pretty tight piece of filmmaking.Denzel Washington stars as Bennett Marco, an army captain who was involved in an incident in the Gulf War in which his sergeant, one Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) rescued the entire platoon during a firefight. Flash forward a dozen years later, and most of the rest of the squadron is having bizarre dreams about what might have really happened in the desert. Marco's only choice is to track down Shaw and confront him about it; but that's not as easy as it would seem.The original story was creepy and tense, and this version lives up to that, putting Marco and by extension us in an increasingly paranoid place as we begin to see just what is going on. This is a story that could have fallen flat with an update, but thanks to some deft writing and acting, translates superbly to a modern day setting. There are also some barbs thrown at network news (very subtle but very effective), as well as the Democratic party (though it is not named as such) and Halliburton (in here, Manchurian Global).Washington is excellent as the always off-kilter Marco, and he has a few scenes where he simply shines. Denzel always has a certain intensity but here he seems to wholly mesh with the character in a few scenes, resulting in some very natural acting (which I like a lot). Schreiber isn't quite as good, but he gives overall a solid performance as Shaw. Meryl Streep is wonderfully effective, scary, and creepy as Shaw's mother, a senator in her own right; Streep seems to be channeling Hilary Clinton a little in her performance, but she's dead-on effective in a fairly demanding role (Angela Lansbury nailed it the first time; it may be the key role in the film).
Director Jonathan Demme uses the camera well to heighten the feeling of paranoia and suspicion, giving us close-ups that are just a little too close and an almost palpable feeling of things closing in on us. I also felt the quick cuts at the end of some scenes help kept us moving and kept the story flowing nicely. Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris throw in more than a few lucidly topical comments about what's going on in our own country today as regards the war on terror,' and as a result the film feels especially topical. Between that and the fine acting, Manchurian is definitely a winner. Though it probably won't capitalize on current fears the way the well-timed Sum of All Fears did, Manchurian is nonetheless a well-crafted and well-acted film that certainly deserves a look in theaters.",The Manchurian Candidate
94,extravaluejotter,The Manchurian Disappointing Remake,1,3 September 2006,"In this film there's a scene where Denzel Washington's character is doing research in a public library. Sitting to his left is a man who looks a little like Elvis Presley. There are those who believe that Presley faked his own death to get away from the celebrity treadmill.There are also, I expect, people who believe that a multinational corporation will employ hundreds of people and spend millions of dollars to brainwash an American army patrol and create a war hero.There may even be some who believe that the war hero's mother will then groom him for political office and get him nominated as the USA's Vice President Elect. There may be a few who believe that the only surviving member of the war hero's unit, having tried to expose the conspiracy, will then be programmed to kill the new President, leaving the VP (effectively a pawn of the multinational corporation) to rule America.Quite frankly, the plot of ""The Manchurian Candidate"", uprooted from the original Cold War setting, has more holes than a sieve. Let's be honest, the USA already has a president who's no more than a corporate puppet. I'm pretty sure that the big oil corporations didn't have to drill holes in George W Bush's skull to get what they wanted from him. I bet they didn't have to employ any rogue South African geneticist, or pay all the people who would have been required to kidnap him, administer his treatment and monitor him on his way to the White House. Oh yes, and let's not forget all the manpower and resources required to make an ex-Soviet Bloc behavioural research scientist and his lab full of animals with probes in their heads completely disappear overnight. This is Bond Movie territory, and trying to play it straight and earnest takes all the fun out of the wacko high concept of the new ""Manchurian Candidate"". Despite some solid performances (no-one does ""deranged"" quite like Meryl Streep, for example) ""The Manchurian Candidate"" remake foundered as soon as I heard a background soundbite about Manchurian Global. Manchurian. Candidate.Be honest. You don't have to be a dedicated conspiracy theorist to start joining the dots after a giveaway like that, do you? We don't really need a predictable, heavy-handed 2.5 hour-long sledgehammer film lecture from director Jonathan Demme to tell us that our politicians are corrupt and that some areas of Big Business are run by some very unpleasant people, do we?

95,Pavel-8,Where the heck is Manchuria?,7,2 September 2004,"**Warning! Major spoilers in the clearly marked paragraph!**
""The Manchurian Candidate"", an update of the 1962 movie of the same name, is a rarity among recent American cinema, not only in its genre, but in how that genre is approached. First of all, the film is a political drama, which is sparse enough a category. Secondly and more impressively, the film refuses to take a political side. As opposed to recent cinema such as ""The Contender"" or television like ""The West Wing"", the political parties here aren't even delineated, let alone attacked or defended. This refreshing individuality peaks the film's mountain of mastery, which quivers due to shakiness at a key moment. While the original (which I haven't seen) dealt with the Korean War and its communist influences, this version focuses on a post-Gulf War chain reaction that includes a presidential race and a mysterious mega-corporation. Denzel Washington, in a role often eerily similar to his ""Courage Under Fire"" turn, is Ben Marco, an Army major and the commander of Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) during the Gulf War. Shaw earned a Medal of Honor in saving his unit from an ambush, and has since parlayed his heroism into a potential run at the vice presidency, thanks also to the efforts of his mother, Senator Eleanor Show (Meryl Streep). Marco, meanwhile, is floundering as a military desk jockey, plagued by puzzle pieces of dreams and flashbacks that don't quite fit together. While Shaw's star ascends, Marco's confusion and investigation accelerate, as he attempts to determine precisely what happened back in the Gulf and what is happening in the now.
Marco's dilemma is similar to the audience's dilemma, except that the viewers are even more oblivious than he, a circumstance that propels the entire film. In many movies, you may not know precisely what is going on, but you at least grasp the concept. For most of ""Candidate"", you have zero clue, as though the entire plot were blurred. The story treats you like Hansel & Gretel, dropping a bread crumb of information every few minutes, tasty enough to maintain interest, even though you don't know the road.
***SPOILER WARNING!*** Unfortunately, at the film's conclusion, you don't know what happened either, but in a different way. You know the events, but the calculations behind them don't add up. Why does Shaw prevent the assassination? Why does Marco shoot anyway? Who's been brainwashed by whom? I and everyone I know who has seen this cannot devise a plausible scenario in which the final events would occur. Can I get some help here? Anyone? Bueller?
***END OF SPOILERS!*** The flaw in the finale isn't overly disturbing though, because it sates general expectations, and because ""Candidate"" is done well enough to gloss over (but not black out) such a mistake. Washington and Streep are (yawn) once again excellent, Denzel in a typical semi-heroic role, Meryl in one icily dissimilar from her usual part. Schreiber and everyone else easily hold their own to form a film that feels more like an ensemble cast than a Denzel or Streep vehicle. Director Jonathan Demme proved with ""Silence of the Lambs"" that he possesses a modern sense of suspense rarely seen outside of Shyamalan. Despite the difference in genres, that talent is on display again in ""Candidate"". Using slow zooms and numerous first person shots, Demme permeates the film with paranoia and suspense. He keeps you continually off-balance, but also keeps you intrigued as the film steadily presses to its conclusion.  In this regard, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is probably actually better if you haven't seen the original, because any foreknowledge will deprive the film of its stimulating tension. Bottom Line: An inexplicable closing act is the only thing keeping this film from greatness. 7 of 10.",The Manchurian Candidate

Liev Schreiber plays her son and he is convincing as the brainwashed soldier from the war in Kuwait.  The times have changed since the cold war.

Although everyone in its great cast does yeoman service, Liev Schrieber as Raymond Shaw is particularly impressive.  He is simultaneously creepy and sympathetic.  As always, Meryl Streep as Schrieber's mother, New York Senator Eleanor Shaw, is a hoot  funny and scary.  (If you squint you can see Hillary.)
Jonathan Demme leaves no political position unskewered here.  Best of all, though, this is a genuinely frightening film, which maintains its dramatic tension from beginning to end.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that this version of `The Manchurian Candidate' is very similar to the original, starring Frank Sinatra, et al.  It is not. Many important plot points are changed.  Most importantly, instead of being apsychological thriller, as the 1962 film was, this version is a science fiction film.  This is good stuff; see it.  9 out of 10.",The Manchurian Candidate
99,Chromium_5,"Oh my God, this was bad.",5,1 August 2004,"***Spoilers ahead***I must say I was quite disappointed with this movie. It's a shame to see such great actors in something like this.The main problem is the way the whole story is laid out. It would have been much better if the movie was about Denzel Washington gradually figuring out he was brainwashed. Instead, the brainwashing flashbacks are revealed right away, and the movie is about Denzel Washington trying to convince people he has been brainwashed. This is rather stupid, and, in my opinion, a lot less thrilling.I guess I kind of assumed the brainwashing scenes would be quick and subtle, and the movie would be about the reasons behind it. But no, the brainwashing IS the movie. We get to see a full-fledged secret laboratory out in the desert, with tubes and wires everywhere, and chanting ladies dressed in black cult robes (what the hell?). Lots of blood and gore, too. It's not thrilling, just gross.And about this secret laboratory--it's under the control of a CORPORATION!!? And no military or intelligence agency knows it's there??It would make a lot more sense for this lab to be run by terrorists or something, but I suppose this wouldn't be politically correct, so instead we have to believe the villain is Acme, Inc. Whatever.Liev Schreiber gets stuck with some of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie. First he gets an ""Invaders From Mars"" type of operation in his hotel room, and then, as if that's not embarrassing enough, he gets to stand there naked with a goofy grin while his mother caresses him. This was actually more difficult to watch than the torture scenes, in my opinion.All in all, we get a movie that is alternately gross, weird, corny, and unbelievable.

100,FilmSnobby,Talk about stating the obvious!,1,8 September 2004,"I won't waste many words on this update of what was already an overheated, absurd melodrama . . . er, ""classic"" from 1962. In 2004, with the impetus for the original plot line long gone, Jonathan Demme has to come up with SOMETHING . . . so he throws Iraq (the 1991 version) into the mix. But seething Sunnis are, let's face it, no comparison to the good old Commies of yore, in terms of global reach and inducement to paranoia. So, again, Demme has to come up with SOMETHING . . . so he has Halliburton -- er, ""Manchurian Global"" -- kidnap a platoon on the sandy battlefield, haul them off to an Undisclosed Location, and turn the most prominent member of said platoon -- the rebellious son of a Hillary-esque senator -- into a brainwashed, privately-owned candidate. Hence the strained title of the 2004 version. (In Frankenheimer's original, Sinatra's boys were actually in Manchuria, fighting those dirty North Koreans. Or something.) Meanwhile, a spaced-out Denzel Washington, who was a member of the patrol, fumbles around, trying to figure out what happened 13 years after the fact.I understand that right-wingers are put off by this movie. Hmmph. If anybody ought to be put off (besides discerning movie buffs, of course), it should be LEFT-wingers. This idiot movie posits the notion that powerful, moneyed interests could actually own and operate a Vice Presidential candidate. What an insult to the intelligence of those of us who have long ago figured out that the current Vice President is ALREADY owned and operated by a powerful, moneyed interest. And without brainwashing or computer chips drilled into his skull! Hey, here's an idea: why not tell the story of a lugubrious Vice President who WILLINGLY serves the evil, greedy aims of a global conglomerate, and by doing so, profits obscenely?

Both discover that someone put a microchip in themselves, which makes them act under strange orders...Many things has changed from the first film. In 2004 the main America enemy and source of paranoias is terrorism, in 1962 it was communism. Today ""Manchurian Global"" is a multinational company -because the world is ruled also by these entities-, in the Sixties Manchuria means a place where communism grows.Actors are good, but the movie lacks the original soul. The Sixties film was very inventive and more satirical towards dominant power; the remake is softer instead and the story is spoiled by a certain idea of heroism. The sense of Gulf War is not criticised and at a certain moment Schreiber gives Washington his own medal (""I don't deserve it!"").In an era where terrorism threat and idea of preventive war are so strong in US administration, 2004 version of ""Manchurian candidate"" could be more critical.Jonathan Demme is a good director, who hasn't produced something really hot since ""The silence of lambs"" (1991). Until that film he was more creative, afterward he became very mainstream.It's a pity, because from a technical point of view the film is good and visual solutions are still great. But there's more form than real substance.",The Manchurian Candidate
103,eastbergholt2002,Thriller with Ambitions,8,30 December 2006,"Manchurian Candidate is an engrossing thriller, with an implausible plot. It is based on an 1959 Richard Condon novel about a Communist conspiracy to kill the president. The story has been updated and a private equity firm called Manchurian Global are the evil plotters. Manchurian seems to be loosely modeled on the Carlyle Group. Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) while serving with the U.S. army during the Gulf War leads a team of soldiers. One of his men Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) saves them from an ambush. Shaw receives the Congressional Medal of Honor and this recognition enables him to get elected to Congress. Shaw becomes a contender for the vice-presidential candidacy. He receives able support from his senator mother Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep) who persuades the party to put him on the ticket. Jon Voight plays his rival. Returning to the U.S., Marco an ex-Delta Force special forces type is diagnosed with Gulf War syndrome and spends his time giving talks to scout troops about Shaw's heroism. The critics regarded the original film as a satire on American political life. This movie didn't have any laughs and if anything its message seemed to warn about the dangers of pushy mothers and the evil ambitions of private equity firms. The actors are all excellent and make you believe in what is a preposterous story. Streep is so charismatic, smart and ruthless you start wondering whether she rather than dull Raymond might not be a better bet for high office. Demme has made an enjoyable, slick and far-fetched entertainment.",The Manchurian Candidate
104,colonel_green,A superb thriller.,7,8 August 2004,"Quite possibly the summer's best movie, against stiff competition from the likes of ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", Jonathon Demme's brilliant update of John Frankenheimer's original deserves great critical and audience recognition. Demme (best known for directing ""The Silence of the Lambs"") has great source material, an excellent cast, and a mountain of expectations to overcome. While some film remakes are good, most are bad movies that exist solely to make money off the success of the original.  Not so with this film.  Demme (like Frankenheimer before him) has found an ideological target, and he goes after it.  His target is the current Administration of President George W. Bush, the American military-industrial complex, and the power of large corporations; all worthy targets, to be sure.  Dubya-bashing is always welcome. Performancewise, Denzel Washington does his usual quality work as the troubled lead character, Major Bennett Marco; Liev Schreiber is equally impressive as brainwashed Raymond Shaw, indeed, more convincing than Laurence Harvey; finally, we have Meryl Streep as Eleanor Shaw, who steals the show with her sometimes campy, sometimes chilling performance.  Jon Voight appears in a supporting role, also doing good work.  Smaller parts are played by notable character actors like Zeljko Ivanek, Jude Ciccolella, Dean Stockwell, and Jeffrey Wright. After reading so much about the original film, I was somewhat disappointed when I watched it for the first time.  To me, it was overrated, a view I know few other film buffs share.  I actually consider Demme's remake to be the better film, probably because it is made to appeal to my generation, not the generation that came before.",The Manchurian Candidate

I had expected something routine, formulaic, Denzel Washington plays hero to political villains entertainment, yet I wasn't anticipating something worthwhile, engaging, and suspenseful as the film turned out to be. This ""Candidate"" has plenty of edge-of-your seat suspense thrills, whodunnits, and murder-by-numbers, and succeeds in many respects, if in some instances flawed, particularly in its logic. The leading actors shine: Denzel Washington is captivating as an afflicted, brainwashed Gulf War veteran trying to sort the pieces of his potential involvement in a political ""sleeper"" scheme. Meryl Streep is conniving and antipathetic in a role where you love to hate her. Liev Shreiber is exceptional in his second-rate role, doing what he can to supply understanding to his character's subjective role in the plot. This film contains some of the most chilling sequences I've seen in a while, particularly when the chips are being installed in the subjects' brains. Creepy! Overall, an engaging, gripping thriller, open to plenty of speculation and offering plenty of edge-of-your seat thrills. Sometimes too complex and illogical, yet overall very satisfying escapist fare, with an equally pleasing, eerie climax. ***1/2 OUT OF ****",The Manchurian Candidate

The film is simply covering old ground, the story of a paranoid vet running around causing trouble and trying to expose a huge conspiracy has been done in a lot of other films before this and this one adds nothing new to the genre, perhaps the original was good for it's time but this one certainly isn't.The performances are good with Washington, Schreiber and Streep all delivering the sort of quality acting you would expect but they can't save the film.The script is dull and unimaginative and the directing is an exercise in cliché.The ending is good if you can be bothered watching it to the end, I'd recommend using fast forward for large chunks since skipping the dialogue doesn't lose much.A terrible waste of a good cast.",The Manchurian Candidate

Director Jonathan Demme altered the original version to significant extent and thanks to that the movie looks up-to-date and the plot is dramatized. Although the film tells the story we all know well, it attracts our attention as it's very stylish and well-made. The flick depends mainly on the acting which is sensational. Meryl Streep (Oscar nominee) as a possessives mother and senator is a stand-out. Rob Shreider plays convincingly a man being controlled and confused. Only Denzel Washington seems a bit off-colour. The film retains a claustrophobic atmosphere of the original and the themes of overpowered companies and gaining control over people are still present. Nevertheless, it doesn't maintain its momentum. The beginning is too slow and on the whole longueurs occur, whilst the ending is a highlight. To conclude, The Manchurian Candidate is a good remake which despite an uneven pace is worth your while even if you know this story.",The Manchurian Candidate

On IMDB 1962 is rated as a 7.9 and 2004 as a 6.6. If you watch them back to back it is easy to see that these are not good ratings. I gave 1962 a 4 and 2004 an 8.1962 is slow and ponderous. Sinatra is always interesting to watch but he can't drag the whole film by himself. The plot is tough to believe. Hard to understand why the 1962 version got such high ratings.2004 is a bit more sci-fi and the technical parts of the plot make the whole movie more believable (if you accept sci-fi magic). Streep, who I generally abhor, reminded me SO much of HRC. Denzel and Liev gave great performances. The current featured review of the 2004 version calls the ""1964 (sic) version a near perfect masterpiece"" Huh??If you're a student of film give the back-to-back exercise a try ...",The Manchurian Candidate

Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington were fine together but the plot itself got caught in its own web and fell on its face. I will probably need to watch another time to see if it all makes sense but there is brain washing for crying out loud. Highly realistic and perfect for a political thriller of course.

I was pleasantly surprised.It's high tech, state of the art and kept my interesting going for the entire film. I am a big fan of Mr. Washington - he's one of our great great actors and he does a wonderful job in this film. Meryl Streep is superb. She handles the role with great professionalism. The entire cast, including director Roger Corman is solid and fine.The story line keeps to the original concept of the original film, however there are enough changes and intrigues that keep your attention and not really knowing how the film will evolve and I appreciate that. J. Demme is a good director, from his ground breaking Philadelphia (again with a huge performance by Denzel W) to this film - congratulations!

This film plays on your emotion' s and your thoughts sort of like someone sticking a wire into your ear and poking your brain over and over again. It's like a monkey you've got on your back that you just can't shake. It's diabolical as it is malicious and it moves along like a evil little spider across the screen. Trying to draw you in and take you to a realm of chaos, paranoia, madness and depravity.Denzel Washington turns in a fine performance as Major Ben Marco and Liev Schreiber does just as well If not better as Raymond Prentiss Shaw, Meryl Streep is a little lacking in the conviction and emotion department and her performance was sort of annoying as the overly patriotic and narcissistic mother of Ray Shaw. Jon Voight does relatively well in the few scenes he's in, but it's nothing Oscar worthy or amazing, but he is good none the less. All in all the cast holds up very well and makes this a very watchable and exceedingly good movie.The Manchurian Candidate is something of a revelation in movies, It's like your conscious warning you that not everything in life is what it seems. And that people, people you trust with your life or people you know can be manipulated into mind puppets and use for a corrupt and evil system. The moral undertones of this movie were astounding and eye opening, It brings to light whether or not who can be trusted? Or for that matter if where you are right now is even safe? It's a very good political thriller that moves along at a relatively good pace , it's story flows off the screen and embeds itself into your mind like a micro processor that keeps feeding you your worst nightmares over and over and over again until it drives you mad. The Manchurian Candidate is that film, and though it is not the original it does live up to it's reputation well. And on some levels even surpasses it.

113,Critical Eye UK,Brain dead,1,16 May 2005,"One of the finest political satires ever written, Richard Condon's 'The Manchurian Candidate' is a Trojan Horse of a novel, its purpose hidden within the artifice of a meticulously constructed thriller.Condon chronicles the odyssey of Major Marco, a Korean War veteran who believes that his life, and the lives of his comrades, were saved by Sergeant Shaw in an act of bravery that has, quite properly, made Shaw an All American Hero.But because bizarre nightmares increasingly suggest that Marco's memory plays him false, he sets out to discover the truth, contending with the fact that Shaw is the step-son of a political puppet whose strings are controlled by Shaw's power-crazed mother.Shaw, it eventually transpires, has been brainwashed by the Chinese Communists in Manchuria. So have the rest of the unit. The brainwashing was carried out to equip the Communists with a means to one day take over America. Shaw, the ultimate sleeper-assassin, will gun down a presidential candidate. His step-father, the vice-presidential nominee, will make an emotional speech blaming Communism. The speech will fuel a Rightwing backlash that will sweep him and Shaw's mother into The White House.Fortunately, Major Marco unravels the Manchurian plot. And poor tortured Shaw finally understands that he has been manipulated, hypnotised, and conditioned to such extent that he no longer has the capacity to exercise freedom of choice. Condon's message is clear. Politicians will sacrifice any principle in the pursuit of success. But being fundamentally stupid, politicians are ignorant of the dangers their stupidity invites. So those dangers are instead perceived  but shrugged aside -- by shadowy figures who exist behind the politicians, puppet-masters to whom any ideology is worthy of cosmetic embrace so long as it enables them to satisfy their own monstrous vanity.Thus, the idiot that is Shaw's step-father. Thus, the monster that is Shaw's mother. Thus, Shaw himself, not The All American Hero, but the heroic All American Electorate, sleep-walking its way towards the destruction of everything it once held dear.An America that could produce a writer like Condon and a book like 'The Manchurian Candidate' is America at its best, for such a novelist, and such a novel, could only have sprung from a society with the wit to think, the vision to see, and the ability to reason. An America that could render Condon's masterpiece so beautifully on screen is also America at its best, for in the hands of director John Frankenheimer and legendary screenwriter George Axelrod, and with powerhouse performances by Frank Sinatra as Marco, Laurence Harvey as Shaw, Angela Lansbury as Shaw's mother and James Gregory as the deranged politician, 'The Manchurian Candidate' of 1962 was, and so remains, movie-making at its finest.And now we have ""The Manchurian Candidate"" version two.And director Jonathan Demme and screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris.And it is not merely that this is very possibly the worst American film of living memory, a cheap conceit so utterly defeated by the consequences of its own larceny that the incoherence of its narrative is matched only by the ineptitude of its writing and direction.No. What's worse is that we have something that actually got made. In America. And seems actually to have been liked by a large section of the audience. In America.Gone from Manchurian 2 is the politician made to dance by a master behind the scenes. Gone, therefore, is the puppet master, leaving Shaw's mother with no rational explanation for her actions. Gone, too, is Shaw the tortured Everyman, and with him the entire point of the original fable. Instead, and in so complete a misapprehension of character and purpose that it's no wonder Denzil Washington looks confused throughout, Marco assumes the assassin's role.Finally, gone is Manchuria, and Communism, the devices  which is all they were: 'The Manchurian Candidate' is no more about the Cold War and Communism than 'Gulliver's Travels' is about foreign holidays  the devices via which Condon warned of the dangers to liberty that await when individuals are so manipulated that they bring upon themselves the very fate they've been most anxious to avoid.But because the purpose of Manchurian 2 is to profit from Manchurian 1 the makers can't actually junk that, so produce in its stead The Manchurian Something or Other Corporation, run by The Most Powerful People In The World, employing A Mad Scientist from South Africa. . .Manchurian 2 isn't the first case of moronic movie-making. And it certainly won't be the last. But it certainly ranks high amongst the most dishonest, and disturbingly so because it begs the question: if rubbish like this can be made in America today, what's next? ""Catch 22"" as a cop thriller about baseball? How about ""MASH"" then, the tale of a potato grower taken over by aliens? ""Nashville""? A private eye who composes country music in between solving murders.Never mind the talent that conceived and the intellect that drove those originals. And never mind the stories, either: those plots, they're all much, much too deep for today's movie-goers.Let's just take the title instead. Pretend it's a remake. Then sit back and let the money roll in from an audience whose collective brain has been so conditioned by the mind-numbing pap of so much in contemporary culture that it can no longer tell the difference between what's good and what's bad, what's valuable and what's worthless.In which respect then, maybe Demme, Pyne and Georgaris have bettered the stellar combination of Condon, Frankenheimer and Axelrod. They've shown that Raymond Shaw is no longer a fictional character way out in a mythical Communist China, but a real live brain-dead human being now being serially replicated to the point that it's sitting in a movie theatre near you. . .",The Manchurian Candidate
114,imxo,"A Good Movie, But The Carlyle Group Won't Like It.",7,1 August 2004,"The Manchurian Candidate is a darn good movie, whether or not you've seen the original 1962 version. In this 2004 version, though, Manchuria refers not to the name of the Chinese province, but to the name of a nefarious American corporation with global interests. Some folks want to equate it to Dick Chaney's Halliburton, but I prefer to believe it's more descriptive of The Carlyle Group, a private company that has had on its payroll people with surnames such as Bush, Bin-Laden, Carlucci, among others. If there's ever a place where money, power, and government intersect it's at The Carlyle Group. Consider this item which The Carlyle Group has conveniently omitted from Chairman Emeritus Frank Carlucci's company biography: This former ""Foreign Service Officer from 1956 to 1980"" was carried on the books as the Political Officer in the U.S. Embassy in the Congo when America's Congo nemesis, Patrice Lumumba, was assassinated there by the Belgian secret service. Probably just a coincidence. And it's probably another amazing coincidence that Carlucci could rise from humble State Department Officer to Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the strengths of the current Manchurian Candidate movie is that the power struggles and levels of technology presented in the movie are absolutely applicable to the same quest for power and level of technology that we see all around us today. I think we ignore this intersection of power, money, high technology and government at our peril. It's a good movie for reminding us of that fact.",The Manchurian Candidate

You don't need to see the Frankenheimer original (which was pretty good, if not the classic it's sometimes made out to be) to see that this movie is garbage. Most obscenely, The Manchurian Candidate is routinely praised as ""smart,"" when in fact it is a 129-minute nonstop insult to the viewer's intellect, as well as to whatever artistic sensibilities he or she has.The story follows Denzel Washington's Bennett Marco, who is kidnapped along with his entire squad of U.S. infantrymen during the first Gulf War, a remarkable trick somehow pulled off single-handedly by his unarmed guide, who is evil because he works for a private contractor called Manchurian Global. Manchurian Global then uses Advanced Technology to brainwash them all, including the squad leader Sgt. Raymond Shaw, into machines who will kill their own comrades  or consent to be killed by them  without hesitation. Seventeen years later, Shaw's mother maneuvers him into running for Vice-President of the United States, his sole qualification being his fictitious war heroism, which is based on false memories implanted in him and his squad during the brainwashing. Manchurian Global leaves Marco alive, apparently because they want their evil plot foiled, which Marco proceeds to do.The idiocies that ensue are mind-boggling. I almost tore out my hair screaming WHY? 1. WHY does Senator Jordan advertise his knowledge of the coup plot to the plotters, while doing nothing to protect himself?2. WHY does Raymond Shaw drown the Senator with his bare hands in broad daylight (had Jordan been so much as carrying a pocket pistol, he could have defended himself)? 3. WHY does Jocelyne wade up to her father's murderer so he can drown her too, instead of calling 911 for help? 4. WHY does Manchurian bother implanting chips in Marco's and Shaw's shoulders, when it can control them equally well without the chips? 5. WHY doesn't Marco pull out the drainpipe trap to recover the chip he's dropped? 6. WHY isn't Marco arrested and imprisoned when he slugs his interrogator? 7. WHY doesn't Shaw press charges against Marco when Marco bites him? 8. WHY am I watching this movie? The ninth ""why"" is, ""why does anyone consider this movie intelligent?"" Doubtless, because it is transparently aimed at the crew of nitwits and fanatics that have run most of the U.S. government since 2001. For supporters of the American right wing, movies like this are a minor irritant at most. But for its opponents (and I am certainly one), this film is an infuriating example of the intellectual feebleness of the art world's resistance against the sectarian, paranoid, and authoritarian currents sweeping America.Rating: A million trillion zeros!

Why they had to try to remake a classic and a great movie as the Manchurian Candidate is beyond me.  First of all, to those people who approved the making of this movie---should be fired!  Second, if you are going to remake a classic, at least change the title if it is not going to be relevant in the movie.  For instance, the title of the movie is ""Manchurian"" in the original movie because a group of US soldiers were captured by the North Koreans during the Korean War.  In this remake, they are in the Gulf War in Kuwait.  They should have changed the title to the Kuwaiti Candidate instead.  Third, the enemy in the original was the ""evil empire,"" the communist countries of the world.  The enemy in this remake is a multinational corporation.  A corporation?!  If you were a story writer and you had to create a villain, and your choice is the Soviet Union or a corporation, which would you choose?  Soviet Union of course!  Fourth, the late Katherine Hepburn did not like Meryl Streep's acting and I certainly concur.  She is too melodramatic and overacts her scenes.  Maybe it is her theater background that is causing it but she is clearly annoying in this picture.  Fifth, the story is just plain boring.  The original movie drew you into the story and made you care about the characters.  In this movie, I felt absolutely no connection to the story or the characters.  Lastly, compare to the overall performance of the actors and actresses in the remake as oppose to the original---the original without a doubt has the better overall performance.
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD VIDEO OR DVD STORE AND RENT THE ORIGINAL.  You will not regret it.

117,98nurdinm-1,"Next Candidate, please...",6,2 October 2005,"The remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is an interesting affair. It has some good characters and performances, and an excellent music score as well, but somehow it just doesn't work as an original film.The film starts well, with an attack on a group of American soldiers near Kuwait in the first Gulf War. One of the soldiers, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schrieber) rescues most of his fellow soldiers in a daring escape, and is awarded the Medal of Honour as a consequence. But when Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is visited by one of his former soldiers, who claims that his dreams reveal the truth as to what really happened, he begins a frantic search for the truth as Shaw's campaign to become the next candidate for Vice-President starts...Having not seen the original, I cannot claim whether or not this is as good a film as the Frank Sinatra 1962 version. Obviously the story is different: the enemy here is not Communists, but rather a large international company with rather sinister ideas.Denzel Washington gives a good performance as the obviously confused and bewildered Marco, and betrays the sense of Gulf War syndrome that the character suffers from well. His anger is quiet, smouldering - except for when he punches the FBi agent in the nose. That's a pretty good moment in the film, I have to admit.Meryl Streep - who seems to have been around forever - gives a powerhouse performance as the senator mother of Shaw, striving to get into the White House after the (suspicious?) death of her husband failed her to do so last time. But I do feel that perhaps she could have been more sinister throughout. There were times in the film where I felt a sort of Norman Bates connection to her ""Mother"" character and her relationship with her son that could have been played on better.This is partly the fault of Liev Schrieber - someone whom I've not seen before - who is okay as Shaw, but I feel that perhaps he needs a bit more emotion when he isn't acting like a robot, again when he is acting with Streep. When he discovers the truth, he becomes more of a simpering little child - again something that could be developed in the film, but is ignored except for the rather infamous scene in the bathroom between Shaw and his mother.The film could survive with Washington and Streep, but the story just doesn't have the same ring to it any more. It would have been better for the enemies to have been Al-Queda or some terrorist group - perhaps even Sadamm Hussain? The whole concept of it being a large corporation just seems rather like a James Bond film, which this shouldn't be. The use of the media to tell a lot of the story helps in a way, but there are times when it goes a little OTT, even for American standards - no offence intended.""The Manchurian Candidate"" is an okay film, but if director Jonathan Demme is trying to make some sort of political statement, then he's going the wrong way about it. The film would work better as a sci-fi thriller than a political thriller.6/10",The Manchurian Candidate

Really and truly, I do absolutely love dream-like movies, and don't need everything explained to me, but these useless, lazy plot tangents are just plain dumb. I get the feeling that Demme and crew took some puffs on the stupid pipe to make this movie and thought what they were doing was really cool. Seriously, this is the only explanation that makes sense. On the plus side, somebody needs to put Denzel Washington in a decent movie where he can play crazy. He really was amazing. It's just too bad he was in this movie doing it.

119,nomorefog,Invigorating and interesting,8,7 July 2011,"Denzel Washington lives in a walking (and waking) nightmare after coming home from the war in Kuwait, as he carries around with him some nasty experiences that he cannot prove actually happened. This is a sly but effective reworking of the 1962 version, and it didn't really connect with a large audience, which I interpreted as wrong headedness. The film is a scathing indictment of racial profiling and discrimination as well as the manipulation and mistreatment of soldiers who are giving their lives for their country but have little to show for it in recompense. Especially when they return home. I happen to like 'The Manchurian Candidate' and think that Jonathan Demme is at his best when tackling serious subjects such as this. It has a wonderful energy to it and is exciting to watch despite the sombre subject matter. Denzel is exemplary as is Liev Schreiber as the candidate (he's normally too bizarre for my taste.) Meryl Streep is delightfully daffy playing the Angela Lansbury part and the casting of Jon Voight in the John McGiver role adds prestige and support although it is a senior citizen role. The James Gregory part is cut out altogether and the communists are transmogrified into Manchurian Global, a multi-national corporation doing all kinds of awful things that we never actually see, except for one and it's a doozy. Kimberly Elise makes more sense of the Janet Leigh character than Leigh herself was allowed to in the original, and Washington is very touching as a man whose mind has been tampered with in a way that is brutal and humiliating beyond belief.The empty raucousness of Streep's political rhetoric and all the pointless political noise in the background is in contrast to the deathly silences of Al Melvin, the senator and the senator's daughter. The Manchurian Candidate is an angry film made at a time when public support for the war in Iraq was turning against the Republicans, and Demme makes the most of it so that the audience knows and is aware of what side of the fence his film is sitting on.",The Manchurian Candidate

121,jhs39,"Good, not great",7,30 July 2004,"The remake of The Manchurian Candidate lacks the intensity or spikey weirdness of the original version but it's a pretty solid thriller on it's own merits, with very good direction and strong performances.I found the script interesting--the writers actually managed to take a forty year old red scare paranoia thriller that should be hopelessly out of date and to completely refit the material so it's every bit as topical today as it was back then.  In fact, in spite of the fact that the candidate is a Democrat, in this remake the Bush and Haliburton bashing are so obvious that at times the movie feels like Farenheit 911 reimagined as a politican thriller.The biggest fault with this new version is that, in spite of its undeniable cleverness, it's never really all that exciting.  The most obvious difference between the two movies is evident in the nightmare brainwashing sequences in each film.  The original sequence, in which a flower show is transformed into a horrifying and bizarre mind-control session, is not only the undisputed high point of the earlier film, it's easily the best sequence that John Frankenheimer ever filmed.  Demme's comparable sequence in this remake is perfunctory at best, like he was afraid to even try and top the original.  The new sequence is efficient and it advances the story, but it isn't creepy enough and you barely remember it by the time the movie ends.Still, the new Candidate is pretty entertaining and it completely blows away Demme's last remake of a classic film, The Truth About Charlie.",The Manchurian Candidate
122,changingshades,"good, but not as good as the original",8,10 August 2004,"The new Manchurian Candidate is not as good as the old one, despite the fact that Denzel Washington is a better actor than Frank Sinatra. I think the problem is the same as Manhunter and Red Dragon. The lead in the update was infinitely better, but the supporting cast paled in comparison to the orginal and the direction was fairly solid and the writing was good, if a little more convuluted than the other. The choices of changing the characteristics of a lot of the principle characters was a little off putting, and the love story between Liev Schrieber and the senator's daughter. It was nice that all the women looked like actual people, not movie star pretty, but pretty none the less. The woman for Denzel, in particular, had a big booty and mediocre face. Anyway,  I think one of my main probles with the writing was that the first one just said they were brainwashed, whereas this one tried to show how it happened and went way overboard with the technology for it. Still it was really good, and I gave it an 8 out of 10 on IMDB, because I can't give it an 8.5.",The Manchurian Candidate

So i was trapped into buying the M.C. new version, but felt rather confused and not really happy with it. Another visit to another shop, 15 minutes of search and whoop, you get the real one (same price). And it is awful, how much the movie lost of 40 years, where it actually should have gained. Sinatra, Lansbury, Harvey : Shoout out over Washington,Streep and that guy (i can't even recall this name) in the title roles. Powerful black and white versus extended colors without much to show. Tension wonderfully built up vs. complicated plotting. I instantly loved this ""dated"" movie where i came up flat and basically indifferent about the new one. And who is to believe, that Private Equity firms would go that distance, where everything they need is offered to them on a silver tablet by an incumbent ?",The Manchurian Candidate
124,Scorching,Good enough,7,20 January 2005,"One of the greatest films ever made was the Manchurian Candidate which starred Frank Sinatra. Almost half a century later comes a remake this time starring Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schriber. Instead of Korea the action shifts the sands of the Middle East. The basic premise however still remains as a war veteran aspires for political success.Well all remakes will always be compared to it'd predecessor and since only good films get remade you can expect that the newer version would have a built in disadvantage. Well I thought of doing a review purely on it's merits and not how it stacks up to the older movie.I thought generally that the performance by the actors was nothing extraordinary. I was really expecting a good performance from Denzel but I have seen him act better in his other movies. However If I were forced to choose one performance that stood out it would definitely be that of Streep. The highlight of which was an empassionate speech in behalf of his son to her fellow politicians. Every thought was set out very clearly and was very effective. Unfortunately she only had a limited screen time in this movie.In terms of the story it was a roller-coaster ride. At the start it seemed very interesting. As the first few scenes played out I could feel the tension building up. Unfortunately it was never sustained in the middle. Much so that it got pretty dull. It did pick up once again in the latter part only to once again go down in the end as I though that it was predictable.",The Manchurian Candidate
125,bobzmcishl,Never remake a classic,5,21 July 2018,"Even Denzel and Meryl could not save this remake of a classic cold war thriller. Meryl was no match for Angela Lansbury, and Denzel did not ring true in his role, originally played by Frank Sinatra. Lawrence Harvey was outstanding in the original and Schrieber while looking like Harvey was not equal to him. The major flaw though was changing who the bad guys were. In 1962, the Cold War was in full swing and brainwashing by the Chinese Communists was very real. The story does not translate well by updating the time frame.",The Manchurian Candidate
126,tvspace,"clumsy, loud and pointless",3,3 August 2004,"Jonathan Demme's remake of The Manchurian Candidate is a grotesque pilfering of John Frankenheimer's 1962 thriller.  Demme begins the film with what is possibly the worst opening sequence in the history of movies, a poker game between GI's that is frantically shot and edited without any seeming motivation, with jump-cut time ellipses that seem to serve no other purpose than to allow the film to squeeze a few more pop songs onto the inevitable soundtrack.  The opening is so clumsy, loud, and pointless that you almost immediately know you're in for a bad time, and Demme proceeds to deliver on that promise for the next 129 minutes.From both a storytelling and stylistic perspective, this movie stands as a convincing demonstration of the deteriorated craftsmanship that pervades Hollywood filmmaking in this era.  Demme shows little ability to manage either the mood of his film or the suspense (ironic from a director who did both quite effectively in Silence of the Lambs), giving away far too much of the game early in the movie, while failing to either establish coherent characters or even a cohesive milieu in which the action takes place.In place of quality storytelling, Demme provides an excess of ""edgy"" style in every facet -- art direction, cinematography, editing and sound effects. The effect is  at first chaotic and ugly, then, worse: dull.  It's the sort of mess you'd expect a young director managing his first big budget picture to leave on the screen.  Why Demme, who is experienced, if nothing else, couldn't exercise a modicum of restraint with the medium is a mystery not really worth solving.  Finally, and perhaps worst of all, Demme has completely reversed the theme of the first film.  Whereas Frankenheimer's movie creates a foreboding sense of a world run by shadowy forces who cannot be stopped, only temporarily thwarted, Demme's movie takes pains to show that the bad guys can be destroyed... by the U.S. Government.  What in 1962 was a subversive, paranoid thriller about the dangers of modern governments and other nefarious forces has been turned into a self-satisfied morality tale about the Feds riding in to save the day.  Shameful.",The Manchurian Candidate
127,hillary1,Tepid,5,13 February 2005,"I just saw this last night. It was OK, didn't have the shock value of the first one, and there were 'way too many plot holes and story lines that went nowhere for me to think this was a really good movie (it's hard for me to imagine a presidential candidate could drown a man and woman in three feet of water and nobody-no Secret Service agent, no journalist-is around to witness it, or that you would suddenly ""notice"" an implant under your skin 15 years after it was originally put there. What, did he never shower before? That's only two-there are many more examples!)Denzel Washington was as good as he could be, Meryl Streep was tedious and melodramatic from Scene 1, and Liev Schreiber was reduced to playing an essentially dead man. Not offensive, but not really that good, either.",The Manchurian Candidate
128,segratz,A Not So Smart Horror Film,5,26 August 2004,"I knew this movie was going to be troubled and long - and I was right. I went with my Grandmother and my little sister and about twenty minutes through my sis leans over and states ""snooze-fest.""Right about that time the mind-control techniques start being shown, and things did disturbingly pick up. The film attempts to be a smart horror film. It sort of works, but the characters are so over-the-top - especially Meryl Streep. She really got on my nerves. I knew what her character she was going for but all I ended up was seeing Streep acting crazy and controlling to the point her she is a caricature.Washington is the best part of the film and his performance is subtle and calculated, which really makes up for the movies' lack of clarity. The ending is a bit confusing, and things wrap up too neatly without really answering a lot of questions. I'd say this movie is forgettable. The mind control stuff is always interesting, but I've seen it done better in other films.",The Manchurian Candidate
129,yespat,Surprisingly Wonderful,9,22 May 2006,"I saw the first Manchurian Candidate a number of years ago and though I thought it was pretty good, it did not leave much of an impression. So when I heard this one was coming out, I did not rush to see it (as remakes are usually even less impressive than the original).What a surprise! They updated it just enough to make it nearly believable which made it very scary. Close to the end there were some plot holes but for the most part it held up throughout.Two little curiosities about the film: The first is that fans of Al Franken will hear his voice early on in the film (as if he were on the radio or TV) as Denzel is walking into his apartment. Later on he makes a very brief cameo too, acting as a reporter. And the other is the 2 small cameos Gail King (Oprah's best friend) makes, acting as a news reporter. Funny and interesting touches.The movie was really good. Don't miss it.",The Manchurian Candidate
130,fred3f,How does it compare to the original?,5,1 January 2005,"The obvious question is how does this compare to the original. I give Demme a lot of credit for even attempting the remake of a classic of this magnitude. More so because he is a skilled director with a reputation that a could suffer greatly from a bad remake of a classic. Overall he pulls it off with credibility although probably not well enough to replace the original.The movie is exciting and holds the your interest even if you have seen the original. It is not a slavish copy, which is good, but more on the script later. If you ignore the fact that improved technology has allowed production values to be better today, the visuals and the editing are a close match to the original. The new film is highly suspenseful and taut, and is the strongest part of the film.In terms of acting the original does come off better. Washington gives the best performance of anyone of the cast. I would say he matches Sinatra in the original, in terms of acting ability. However, Sinatra had a better script, so overall his performance is more convincing. Streep overacts even more than she usually does, and by comparison, Janet Leigh is much better. Liev Schreiber seems stupid, rather than ""under the spell,"" and Lawrence Harvey is far better. The acting is a major flaw in the new film; the director did not control his cast.The real problem with the new film is the script. (slight spoilers coming) The original film was released during the cold war and the brainwashing it portrayed was known to be factual at the time. It had a reality and a immediacy that electrified audiences and even today is chilling. The modern film translates it to a big corporation brainwashing someone to become President. This is very trendy idea, but to my knowledge, has no proved factual legitimacy. Regardless of if corporations MIGHT do such things, the point is that it does not have the reality of the original, and so is that much less real and immediate. The script also seems to have been the victim of story conferences, where typically everyone sticks in things that they think will make the movie sell or will give more time to one of the stars. This made the film drag a bit in some places. The beauty of the original was that the script was tight and to the point. In the original, everything worked for the effect of the film. There were no one liners, no digs at political parties just before an election, no expansion of a star's role just to give him or her more screen time and add nothing to the film.Final evaluation: Very watchable, and exciting. Better than I would have thought, but not up to the original. With better acting, and a better script, the film might have equaled or surpassed the original. Both films are enjoyable and watching one does not spoil the watching of the other.",The Manchurian Candidate
131,georgevader,A solid remake,8,31 July 2005,"The original Manchurian Candidate was released in 1962 and not only had I not seen it, I hadn't even heard of it. So, unlike recent releases such as Dawn Of The Dead, The Italian Job and Assault On Precinct 13 I had very little idea what to expect on viewing this film. What you do get is a fine blend of Jacobs Ladder style paranoia, conspiracy and US Government post 9/11 anti-terrorist propaganda.The assembled cast is second to none, Denzil Washington, Jon Voight, Liev Shreiber are all superb but the star of the show is Meryl Streep as the power crazy, control freak mother/Senator Eleanor Shaw: ""Make no mistake, the American people are terrified, they know something's coming, they can feel it"" Remind you of anyone?A top quality cast, fine performance's and a fairly riveting plot make The Manchurian Candidate highly recommended viewing.",The Manchurian Candidate
132,Patriotlad@aol.com,Double Meanings Abound In The Manchurian Candidate,9,4 August 2004,"Granted, the use of the same title for this movie as was used in the original ""Manchurian Candidate,"" causes some rather serious confusion.  This is not unusual for Hollywood, however, as the filmed versions of works by Rafael Sabatini illustrate very precisely.For example, Sabatini's novel ""Scaramouche"" was first adapted for the silent screen in 1923.  The story was then remade in 1956 as a television series. The same single-word name was used.Sabatini's novel ""Captain Blood"" was first adapted for the silent screen in 1924.  David Smith was the director and Jay Pilcher was the screenwriter with the credits.  Hardly anything is known about this film, now, as it is not available on DVD or VHS.  There must be prints of the original remaining but they may be damaged or incomplete.  The imdb.com listing does not even provide an accurate running time.Nine years later, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland brought ""Captain Blood"" to life in an extraordinary way under the direction of Michael Curtiz.  Casey Robinson did the screenplay for Curtiz and the movie was a huge success.  Naturally, having sound on film helped enormously, as did having Basil Rathbone and Guy Kibbee in supporting roles.
The modern remake of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" was an excellent retelling of the Fennimore Cooper novel, and substantially different from the version filmed in the 1930s.  The credits for the remake include a reference to the 1936 screenplay.  The same goes for the new version of ""The Manchurian Candidate.""In both instances the movies have many of the same characters but different things happen.  Yet both versions of the Manchurian Candidate are explicitly about betrayal on multiple levels.And double meanings abound !!  Hardly anything is what it seems to be in the first movie:  Frank Sinatra plays a tough-as-nails combat veteran who learns that other men he served with are having the same terrible dreams. Initially he has a difficult time being heard, but soon enough he's got enough information to persuade ""the Army brass"" to take him seriously.  In the remake, Washington's Bennett Marco character is controlled until the very end and is a character who is immersed in the 'pathos' of his own condition.In both versions of Condon's story, the man picked to do the shooting is mentally unbalanced by the mind-control and brainwashing techniques which are illustrated in the development of the plot.  Yet in the original, it is Shaw who is to shoot the Presidential candidate at the party convention, so that his mother's lout of a husband, Senator Johnny Iselin, can move up and become the presidential nominee.  She will then control him, and the clear implication in the statements she makes, is that she expects her son to survive and make a clean get-away ....  Marco in this scenario is the Knight-errant, the American hero type, who perserves and succeeds.  Although it may be stretching things a bit to assume that Shaw will survive, even for Hollywood in the early 1960s, it is also possible that the cold-blooded mother ( played beautifully by Angela Lansbury ), is willing to sacrifice her own son to get power.In the remake, Marco is tasked to be the shooter and this will make the chip-implanted Raymond Shaw the President-elect ( probably ), and the clear implication in this version is that his widowed mother has a most un-natural relationship with him !!  Marco in this scenario is wholly disposable.In the original, Shaw and Marco and the others are conditioned in a special facility in Manchuria.  In the remade version, the bad guys are called Manchurian Global and are not communists but rather, financial oligarchs who profiteer on war, war-fighting preparations and the economic turmoil it all creates.It is worth noting, as well, that Manchuria during the Second World War was where the Imperial Japanese Army conducted some of the most vile and disgusting experiments in biological and chemical warfare ever known to mankind.  They had control of mineral-rich Manchuria for many years, and the warlords of their Army used something called Unit 731 for their special experiments.An unknown number of Chinese prisoners of war were slaughtered in some of these vicious experiments, using gas weapons.  Also, it is now known that both British and U.S. soldiers captured by the Japanese were sent to Manchuria, many held at Unit 731, and some of these were subjected to biological experiments.Other prisoners were also used in studies to determine just how long a healthy soldier could last in the utmost kinds of deprivation -- including sleep deprivation ( an important component of mind control or brainwashing ), exposure to severe cold, severe electrical shocks, and severe thirst. Unit 731 became infamous for using Chinese children in some of these brutal experiments.  Charlton Heston narrated a fine documentary on this story about POWs in Japanese-controlled Manchuria.What isn't known widely, now, is that there are still elements of certain ""cults"" in Japan who have kept alive the ""Legends"" of Unit 731 and who read and study the commentaries and philosophical writings of the military leaders who ran this irregular warfare unit during World War II.Now that's really scary.",The Manchurian Candidate

135,Cube_TX,"Not bad, but not great either",6,31 July 2004,"Since I have never seen the original Manchurian Candidate I was able to view this film without the bias of comparing it to the original.  Good acting jobs by Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep highlight the film, but many other characters are left bland.  Jon Voight was horribly underused and his character was so obscure that I was unable to feel any sympathy for him. The same can be said for his character's daughter.  We never are told what happened in the past with her.*****SOME SPOILERS*****One of the key plotholes was the climactic scene at the end.  Marco is about to shoot President-elect Arthur, but Shaw somehow is able to fight off the brainwashing enough to prevent the assassination.  How did Shaw manage to keep from falling back into the brainwashing?  This is never explained.  He knows where the assassin is and purposely prevents the shooting.  Was his mental will more powerful than anyone else who was in the same brainwashing?Why did Marco shoot Shaw instead?  He was brainwashed to kill Arthur, so did the brainwashing have a contingency plan to kill Shaw?  We know he didn't fight off the brainwashing because he still was going to shoot himself afterward.What was the deal with the voodoo-looking ladies with the symbols all over their faces?  The brainwashing was done with electronic implants, so why the black magic?Was there any reason for implying an incestuous attraction Shaw's mother had for him?This movie was not at all bad and worth checking out, but don't expect it to be as thrilling as it could have been.  The last half hour was hyped to be so intense, but left me disappointed.  It wasn't a total letdown, but not so shocking and fast-paced that it excited me.",The Manchurian Candidate
136,giomanombre,Interesting movie - but I would not want to see it twice.,7,12 June 2005,"I like movies that encourage the viewer to think, speculate and see the world differently. I think the deepest themes of the movie is that human beings contain an element - a spirit - that can not be manipulated. I have not seen the original Mancurian candidate - however, this review is for the remake - so I do not rate it in contrast to another movie - but on its own merits. I think the reason this movie is underrated here is people are comparing it to the original.Is there mad scientists going around trying to create mind control. Is insertions into the brain, or certain psychological phenomenon, such as hypnosis, suggestion, possible to manipulate people to do your bidding. However, as the DVD Special Features - 'The Enemy Within' suggests - the CIA did such experiments on subjects in the 50's and 60's, and discovered that the human 'spirit' or that element within each of us can not be controlled. It is an excellent testament - that essentially, we can not be transformed to machines or mindless robots - and our spirits transcend any form of oppression that may seek to undermine it. That is why evil regimes do not stay in power indefinitely.Another theme in this movie is that is there a real democracy? President Bush, for example, could be a puppet of a secret society, or some organization that is pulling his strings. In effect, this movie presents a brilliant political satire. There are many books written that suggests 'Bush' is part of the Scull and Bones secret society, and allot more, and is pushing their agenda in world politics. So, this movie, where the President is mind controlled - is satirical to real politics. The government is run by special interest groups, corporate lobbyists, and secret societies, no matter who is voted in. No matter who is elected as President, some secret organization somewhere is pulling their strings and you have a Mancurian candidate.Again, this is a film that makes you think. The characters played their rolls well, and the story of the movie was there. I was wide awake the whole time to see what would happen next. However - other than these strong themes and thoughts, it is not a movie that I would like to see over and over again - although it was a good ride to view it. To me it may be a blockbuster worthy film, but it is not a cult classic in my books.",The Manchurian Candidate
137,Degree7,"Impressive first half, limp conclusion",6,30 January 2019,"Why Jonathan Demme's style worked so well was his convincing portrayals of alternate hyper-realities, just slightly tweaked so it's recognizable as a warped mirror of our world. Silence of the Lambs achieved this, and Demme replicates this into a slightly dystopian version of contemporary USA. The public is beset by constant terror threats, news of overseas conflicts omnipresent, this is a much more paranoid society with Orwellian overtones. The first half of the movie is superb in a Alan J Pakuka sort of way as Marco is confronted and slowly uncovers evidence of brainwashing and mind control; the atmosphere gradually grows more and more intense and twisted in a Hitchcock-ian ratcheting of suspense; it almost makes the viewer begin questioning reality along with him, as hallucinations and perceptions become twisted into a guessing game of what is real and what is implanted. The discoveries grow more and more disturbing, but this is where finale becomes predictable. The use of a monolithic corporation pulling the strings is well-worn trope territory as has been said countless times, but that doesn't diminish the fantastic psychological thriller rollercoaster of the first 75 minutes. In particular, Jeffrey Wright gives a wonderful performance as the sadly underused, unhinged plot device that pulls Marco into a nightmarish realm of brainwashing - the sequence in Melvin's apartment is exceptional in its depiction of deranged neurosis. This is where the influence of Silence or the Lambs comes in handy, as it's a convincing portrait of a dark underworld lurking beneath mainstream society's veneer. Washington too gives a superb performance as an anti-hero whose world quickly unravels. What doesn't really develop convincingly is the tragic aspects of the story involving Liev Schreiber's character, and the ending is far too pat even for my unaffected tastes. Streep is given a one-dimensional to work with, but still adds some ham to the proceedings with a Oedipus Rex caricature. But the vision of a corrupted future is nice for fans of science fiction thrillers, and the overall uneasiness of the film gives it some zest despite a lukewarm conclusion.",The Manchurian Candidate

Placed in a real background, do they really expect us to believe that this way of controlling people and career planning is possible? Because they give away what happened early in the film, it all depends on the actors if they keep the story convincing en believable. Streep, (the always excellent) Washington and Schreiber give away fine performances so this film survives. Note: The dreams some of the soldiers have are something to question about. Some of the things they see are never explained in the film. Conclusion: A nice film but nothing to be too excited about.",The Manchurian Candidate
139,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,"Forget this dud, the original is much better",2,20 February 2005,"Slight spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen both films.I have the Special Edition DVD release of the original...fantastic film. I sure won't be buying the remake.I rented and watched the remake last night (2004), and here's what I have to say about it: If you haven't seen the original, it's not too bad, but it's bad enough...but to compare the two makes the remake look even more ridiculous.For instance, the first five minutes of the remake look like a VH1 ad, of course. Viacom = Paramount = VH1.The characters aren't developed enough to make me care about any of them, especially Shreiber's character (Shaw). In the original, there was a lot of background on Shaw's summer with Jocelyn etc, and you actually had a lot of sympathy for him...plus Harvey was a far superior, outstanding actor. All that stuff about him saying ""I was lovable"" etc, over and over...it was so sad. The relationship between Raymond and Jocelyn was expanded upon much more, AND the relationship Shaw had with her father, Senator Jordan, and so the girl's and her father's deaths in the original was much much sadder.Receiving a phone call with the caller suggesting ""Why don't you pass the time by playing a little Solitaire?"" is a lot creepier and more ominous (especially as it would come at inopportune times, such as when Shaw would be sitting in a bar) than the person's name just being repeated, in full, to incite the brainwashing. Also, in the remake, they saw fit to have some kind of silly pale ""aura"" every time one of the vets went under the influence of the brainwashing. In the original, Harvey, as Shaw, would get a really peaceful expression on his face, and that was enough, and it was much creepier. Uhm, you know, as in acting to create the effect? Remember acting, instead of special effects? Sinatra's performance was much better, and much more sympathetic, than Washington's. Denzel Washington mostly just went around clenching his jaw. And I usually like his performances. He was very ""one-note"" in this.Liev Shreiber tries his best to emulate Laurence Harvey in the original; it's obvious he studied the 1962 film. But trying to copy another actor's performance doesn't usually work well, and this is no exception. Where Harvey was able to be sympathetic and expressive, in addition to being cold, Shreiber's performance is just plain cold and stilted. His characterization makes Shaw completely uninteresting, and a lot of what made the original film work so well is the sympathy the audience cannot help but have for Shaw.In the original, it seems more believable that Rosie would let a strange man into her apartment, in those days. Sinatra's character comes across as actually ill, and in need of sympathy, instead of just crazy. In the remake, Rosie basically just comes on to Denzel when he's on the train. Yeah, invite him over, girl! It was obvious right then and there that she was in on it somehow, in the remake.Computer chips, in the remake, for the brainwashing, oh puh-leeze.Meryl Streep was okay, but frankly all she seemed to be doing was use the same exact mannerisms and characterizations from her role in ""Death Becomes Her"". She was acting just about the same way, slightly toned down. So to me she was basically walking through her part. She drew on her own past performance in another movie, albeit a comedy, for this.In the scene where she gets ready to kiss Shaw on the mouth, my husband and I said to each other ""In the original, she kissed him, what's she gonna do in this one?"" Well, she just kisses him, thank god, but it's not really shown. In the original, Lansbury's character kisses Shaw full on the mouth, although she has her hand over their lips, it's obvious she is kissing him in a very sexual manner, which of course makes your skin crawl, even in black and white. Especially in black and white. In the remake they brushed over it and really avoided the intensity that scene had in the original, which I found strange.And what can I say about Angela Lansbury in the original? She was only a couple of years older than Harvey was, in real life, and she pulled off playing his mother very believably. The level of evil and menace Lansbury brought to the role isn't even touched by Streep's over-the-top performance.Skip this and watch the original. Why did they try to fix something that wasn't broken?",The Manchurian Candidate
140,bestactor,Very clever and successful adaptation of 60's classic,10,3 August 2004,"Most remakes of good or great movies tend to be significantly inferior to the original and usually leave me wondering who thought it would be a good idea to make another piece of crap that might make money simply because of its built-in title recognition. The new Manchurian Candidate proves that there are a few exceptions to this rule. This adaptation dares to be different in many imaginative ways, yet equally dares to be true to the spirit of its source. The differences prevent any side by side comparison to the original. I was never compelled during the viewing to recall scenes from the original film that I know very well from multiple viewings. What I did notice was the differences of the actors and characters, but at no time did I feel this new version was any less worthy. What was most pleasantly surprising was that the ending still held enough surprise to be effective. This success is quite an achievement and demonstrates the intelligence and imagination of the creative team.",The Manchurian Candidate
141,roark183,Big Disappointment - Stick to the first one,4,26 September 2004,"***Spoiler?*** The first version is vastly superior to this one. The latest version sticks to what is politically correct, ie don't bash the Chinese (as the first one did). Manchurian Candidate (1962) had the Chinese doing the brainwashing, much more credible than some private corporation doing it on some desert island as in Manchurian candidate (2004). This latest version really had to stretch it's story. It just didn't come across as credible as the earlier version. In this new version, the story was stretched in several places to try to make things follow and to try to have the whole thing make sense logically, but it just didn't come across. Should have stuck to the Chinese (or maybe Muslim terrorists) doing the brainwashing. But it appears the film makers are just too sensitive politically to make it credible",The Manchurian Candidate
142,jack_malvern,Wonderful if you haven't been brainwashed by the 1962 version,9,30 May 2005,"How you react to this film depends largely on whether you have seen and liked the original 1962 version. To anyone who holds John Frankenheimer's Cold War movie dear this will seem a sacrilegious and unnecessary remake. To fans of political thrillers who come to it unburdened it will probably make your day.It is difficult for me to judge clearly, as I thought the 1962 version was a dated, erratically acted and shoddily plotted film that deserves its place as a historical piece but not as a thriller.Jonathan Demme's version was, for me, excellent by contrast. The acting is consistently very fine, the plot has been updated and rewritten to make sense and the tension crackles up until the climax.Meryl Streep brings the film to life in the opening reel with a grandstanding performance as the Hilary Clinton-ish politico who transforms a room of sceptics into flag wavers for her son.Liev Schreiber plays the titular candidate, a war hero turned vice-presidential nominee whose squeaky-clean integrity is called into question by his former commanding officer, played with a tenacious intensity by Denzel Washington. Washington's character encounters evidence that they have been brainwashed, and must unravel to what extent either of them are in control of their actions? Fans of the original say that this version's brainwashing villain, a global corporation, is a pale substitute for the Frankenheimer's evil Communist conspiracy. To an extent they are right. Communism, at its height, was a much more intimidating foe.But the loss of the potent symbol at the heart of the conspiracy is more than made up for by the credibility of that conspiracy. Demme's film might lack the 1962 version's iconic brainwashing lecture scene, but it does at least make sense.Unlike Demme's befuddling remake of Charade as The Truth About Charlie, this is a Hollywood revision that stands up in its own right and outclasses its predecessor. Hurrah for Demme. Hurrah for Denzel Washington. Hurrah for Meryl Streep, Liev Schreiber and even hurrah for Dean Stockwell, who appears briefly but wonderfully as an evil corporate type.",The Manchurian Candidate
143,hokiemo,Good Premise but too long and not fully developed,6,8 February 2005,"This movie has an interesting plot, but the movie focuses far too much on some parts and not enough in others. The movie also doesn't depict how having Raymond Shaw being run by the Manchurian Corporation is a bad thing. It's not that I want a robot running the USA, but the movie doesn't demonstrate enough how Raymond is a threat. Surely the corporation's purpose isn't just to have Raymond kill off people who discover his secret. The DVD box called the movie a thriller and I disagree. A true thriller to me is ""Terminator"" or ""Jurassic Park"" where you're on the edge of your seat the entire movie. I was a little bored during the movie and since we were renting, we took a few short breaks.Denzel Washington and Merryl Streep do their best with the script, but it falls short in my opinion. It would be far more interesting if we learned in detail how the Manchurian Corporation was going to harm the USA through Raymond Shaw. Changing memories and corruption is scary, but it would be far more disconcerting to see how the safety of American citizens was hanging in the balance. I give the move 1.5 stars out of 4.",The Manchurian Candidate
144,E-un,Very Disappointing!,1,2 August 2004,"Having seen the original many years ago, I was looking forward to this movie. The acting was done well, and the movie was very believable. However, I have to say that this movie is a complete stinker. The story is completely one-dimensional, and linear to the point of tedium. I actually found myself nodding off at one point, as I didn't feel there was anything new in the movie that wasn't already laid out in the preview. There wasn't one plot twist at all. Denzel's character was weak and had almost no clue of what was going on throughout the whole movie. While this is very realistic, it doesn't make for a good story.The analogy to the current political climate in the US, the idea that corporations are really in charge (or very nearly), was very obvious except that the key villain was a South African, and not from Saudi Arabia!The line, ""Maybe this is all a dream"", was a cheesy reference to Jacob's Ladder (a far superior movie by the way).This movie was given such high praise by the likes of Ebert and Roeper, but it really is a bad movie (and I won't be paying much attention to those two from this point forth). This was the first movie I've seen in a long time after which I felt cheated and would have liked very much to regain both the time I wasted and the money!My recommendation: watch the original and go see something else instead.",The Manchurian Candidate
145,Fenrir-5,If It Ain't Broke ...,1,8 January 2005,"Although the marketers insist that it isn't a straight remake of the original, it obviously is  all they key elements are the same. The new twist is supposed to be a post-modern take on America, because every liberal with a camera loves to point at the United States and laugh. Yet somehow it just feels simple and lazy. All the observations are obvious; the supposedly sly political commentary is about as elevated as Al Franken pulling a funny face, or Michael Moore ingratiating himself to Canadians by assuring them how stupid Americans are.Denzel Washington is the epitome of cool. I don't think he can give a bad performance. He gives this movie all his effort, and I would say that his performance and the brief one by Jeffrey Wright as Al Melvin are the best parts of the film. But even Washington can't overcome a scenery-chewing, cringe-inducing overacting seminar given by Meryl Streep, the exercise in blandness that is Liev Schreiber, and a generally inconsistent, heavy-handed, and patently ridiculous storyline.The movie starts off on the wrong foot with a jarring and poorly-constructed opening. We are subjected to about five minutes of soldiers playing cards in the back of an armored vehicle, while different loud rock tracks cut in every few seconds. This is the credit sequence, and it is not crucial to the movie. But it completely fails to draw the viewer into the atmosphere the filmmakers are trying to set (Wyclef Jean destroying John Fogerty's ""Fortunate Son"" doesn't help).Then we have brief action in Kuwait and a sudden jump cut to the present day. Raymond Shaw is running for the Vice President position, and everyone believes he heroically rescued his entire squad in Kuwait. Marco is on the lecture circuit, speaking to Boy Scout troops about his time in action. He is confronted by former squad mate Melvin, who tells him that he is having bad dreams and who shows Marco a journal of drawings and notes. Marco reacts strangely to this  rather than admitting that he has these bad dreams himself, he holds Melvin at arms' length. We all know at this point that Melvin will turn up dead later in the movie, so it's best to say your goodbyes now.This is where the first plot hole of the movie shows up. Suddenly Marco is completely involved in this conspiracy theory, merely by seeing Melvin's journal and having some more bad dreams. Are we expected to believe that in the years following the incident in Kuwait, the men of the unit never got together to discuss what happened? That none of their superiors found it odd that they gave the same word-for-word description of what supposedly happened, or had the same nightmares? Marco tries to speak with Shaw, who is busy with his campaign and incredibly controlled and domineered by his mother. On the way to speak to Shaw, Marco is approached by a woman named Rosie (the required love interest) who mysteriously invites him to her New York apartment. Here we have another plot hole, as Marco discovers an implant in his shoulder while showering (so he never touched his shoulder for over ten years before this?) but loses it down the sink. Marco then arranges a meeting with Shaw and in a curiously homo-erotic scene bends him over a table and bites his back. This allows him to steal Shaw's implant, which he then gives to crazy scientist friend Delp (another plot line that goes nowhere) who for some reason gives Marco a massive electric shock to the head. I'm sure he explained why he did this, but his accent was so damn thick I couldn't understand a word, and in the end it makes no difference whatsoever.More of the conspiracy is revealed as the presidential election draws near. Marco continues investigating, clicking a Google link as dramatic music plays. Turns out that Rosie may be a federal agent. Shaw himself waffles (he's a flip-flopper!) between robotic guilt and robotic ambition. Meryl Streep eats a couch. Shaw wades into a river in a full suit and kills a man with a kayak, then drowns his one true love. Nobody finds this suspicious. Then suddenly the federal agents who didn't believe a word of Shaw's story completely trust him and escort him to a private room with the man, on the eve of the election; both men are triggered and start the assassination plot  which has a bizarre twist at the end.There is one aspect of the storyline  a dropped plot line  that particularly frustrated me. In the original movie, it was killing his childhood sweetheart that caused Shaw to rebel. In this version we are subjected to a few torturous scenes of Shaw insisting that Jocelyne was his one true love, despite the fact that the two actors have absolutely zero chemistry (to be fair, what woman could love a robot). Then Shaw offs her in a river with her dad and the entire plot line is dropped. This just makes no sense. In fact, the entire scene where Shaw kills the Jordan family is ridiculous  killing a man in the open in his kayak? This screams screenwriter phobia.Why go to all this trouble just to get a guy elected president? It doesn't appear to be very hard to do, particularly if you have the right last name. But at this point in time the demonizing of Americans has become a cottage industry, and everyone wants a piece of the pie. It doesn't seem to matter to the people who buy this stuff whether or not the story is believable, coherent, or even entertaining. As long as it's critical of the United States it's in. If that's your mindset, I suggest you cozy up with this tepid remake and lather up your back for a good patting. Otherwise it's just more grist for the cable TV mill.",The Manchurian Candidate
146,jij98111,The worst remake in Tinseltown history and why,1,1 May 2018,"Everyone who knows this was a remake of one of the best spy thrillers ever made ... a movie that was in tune with the reality of the times. Where there were headline real threats almost daily and our nation's citizens felt on the edge of a possible new world war. That was the real deal. 
Tinseltown has always had a far left bias in its movies so it should not be a complete shock that the villains were completely reversed in this film. 
Ironically Putin was in power when this 'remake' was made. You can or can not draw your own conclusions if you saw the original. 
This remake was completely morphed into a right-wing conspiracy movie from its original communist/cold war very real roots. 
The remake was mediocre at best but the complete betrayal of its context from the original is unforgivable.",The Manchurian Candidate
147,buzzerbill,Why is this a movie?,2,27 September 2005,"First of all, let me go on record that the original version is one of my favorite films, and that Angela Lansbury's performance is one of the all time great screen performances. However, that did not prevent me from approaching this film with an open mind--after all, Jonathan Demme made some of the most original films of the 70s and 80s (not including ""Silence of the Lambs"", which to my mind didn't look like a Jonathan Demme movie, for all the adulation it has received.) After all, Meryl Streep is generally wonderful. After all, Denzel Washington, although not a personal favorite, is a highly skilled performer, and Liev Schreiber looked generally right for the part of Raymond.And yet....And yet....Why was this movie made at all? The original was deeply embedded into the cold war consciousness of the 1950s and 1960s and was weirdly plausible within that context. Furthermore, it's a paranoid thriller which at the same time is one of the great black comedies (along with another, underrated film based on another Richard Condon book, ""Winter Kills""). It's a sleek, elegant and elegantly directed film.In fact, it's one of those films so much a part of its place and time--like ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Casablanca"" or ""Pillow Talk""--that the degree of transformation it would require to be ""relevant"" (what a loathsome word) to a modern audience would destroy what made it great in the first place. A rare exception to this would be a film like ""Down With Love"" which takes the milieu of the early 60s sex comedy and completely and seriously recreates it with a pleasing amount of resonant irony.That is not the case with this film.The first, and most fatal, error is to substitute Big Corporation for The Communists. Manchurian Global, the villain of the piece, is a cross between Halliburton and a hedge fund. Speaking as a long time observer of corporate America, it would be hard to imagine any corporation sticking to a plan to plant a brainwashed operative in the White House over 15 years. Most companies can't look out more than one quarter.The second fatal error is to change the geometry among the characters. Now Major Marco is brainwashed, along with Shaw, and all of a sudden Rosie (played by Kimberly Elise in this version; played by Janet Leigh in the original) is a Federal agent, allowing for a generic ""I am the Feds!"" moment with Denzel Washington. Raymond is the VP candidate; the culmination is the election, not the convention; Marco is the assassin. Last minute rescue of Marco and protracted conclusion follow.Confused yet? Add in several types of sinister implant, never really explained, merely presented as creepy; a friend of Marco's, Delp, played by Bruno Ganz, whom Marco rescued from Albania, experiments with monkeys, knows that a sinister implant ""shouldn't exist"", is a dab hand at electroshock, and vanishes.There are a few good things about this film. Meryl Streep is amusing as Raymond's mother, here positioned as an obvious Hillary Clinton type. Making Raymond a Democrat but a tool of the Big Corporation is a somewhat amusing idea. The direction is full of creepy moments and psychotic images. Cinematography is good.And yet....far less than the sum of its parts. First and perhaps most important, the dark humor (the garden club, the Queen of Hearts)of the original is here replaced with a running soundtrack and images of media sound bites. It is to Demme's credit that it's more annoying in retrospect than while watching the film--and yet however well executed it is generic. Generally good cast, except of Kimberly Elise, who is competent, no more, and certainly no competition for Janet Leigh, who was the emotional center of the original. (Parenthetically, this is the second film by Jonathan Demme that is a remake of an iconic film of the 1960s with less than impressive female leads--Thandie Newton instead of Audrey Hepburn, Kimberly Elise instead of Janet Leigh. What is he thinking??) The plot structure, of course, is violently distorted. And the whole thing comes back to credibility. When you watched the original, bizarre as it is, it was credible. This looks like a rant from the DNC or Al Franklen blown out to a movie script. Why bother? Not unwatchable, but for most, don't waste your time. Go back to the original instead, or watch ""Winter Kills"".",The Manchurian Candidate
148,LG72387,"Corporations, not Communism",6,14 August 2004,"A massive global corporation is now the latest threat to American National Security. Or at least, that's what Jonathan Demme wants us to believe in his remake of John Frankenheimer's classic adaptation of George Axlerod's novel The Manchurian Candidate. Demme's version is more edgier than Frankenheimer's in so many ways. Maybe I shouldn't say edgier but rather more darker. He makes the film seem more in touch with a post-9/11 world and thus is able to consumate it with a vision of reality. It all begins with Ben Marco, a Gulf War veteran, leading his men into a mission. They are ambushed and are apparently saved by Sgt. Raymond Shaw. Shaw is made to look like the hero, everybody goes home happy, Shaw receives the Medal of Honor, and everything is all peaches and cream. Or is it? You see, the problem is Marco keeps having this recurring nightmare in which Shaw doesn't actually save his unit but rather the unit ends up being captured and brought to some secret location, where they are brainwashed into believing that Shaw saved their unit. The film thus begins to toy with the concept of illusion vs. reality. Which is the illusion and which is the reality? All the while, Shaw is being pushed by his egotistical mother, Sen. Eleanor Prentice Shaw, to run for Vice President of the United States. It seems to make sense, after all, he did win the Medal of Honor and all of his unit seems to believe so. But is this all a fantasy? Is it only a dream where Shaw is but a pawn trapped in his own self-conscience? The film is a mysterious, dark, twisted thriller that keeps you engaged just like the original did. We spend the entire film following Marco, trying to search for the answers. What he finds is a shocking revelation of a global conspiracy between the government and the corporation to assume the throne of power. It all leads up to a thrilling conclusion that keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, Demme's picture will never compare to the original version even though it is a taut, well-crafted political thriller. And I am sad to say that not even the decent performances of Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep or Liev Schreiber can compare to Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury or Laurence Harvey.

However I haven't seen the original (although I'm probably going to after reading all the reviews), so my comments are of the movie itself.Now, there was a great cast with a lot of stars, but also quality co-actors like Liev Schreiber and Jeffrey Wright. Denzel has never disappointed me (except for possibly agreeing to do movies like Virtuosity and Ricochet)and although you can't deny the acting talent that Meryl Steep possess - in this one she falters.In the beginning, before we learn she is evil beyond politics, she gives a solid performance as a senator used to the political games. It is as we learn she is in fact a full out bad guy (girl?) that the facade starts to crack. Just like it was hard to shake of Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan as Harrison Ford tries to kill Michelle Pfeiffer in ""What lies beneath"" - I had a hard to see Meryl as a cold hearted, reality lost mother.Another downside is that it doesn't really seem to take off emotionally. Although there are solid performances, the movie fizzles somewhere along the line. The suspense and the emotional charging never seems to break through.

With its clichéd plot, it has been directed and acted well. Especially by Washington who essays a Major in US Army who led a squad in Kuwait. The plot revolves around faded memories in the war and the celebrated medal of honour awarded to Leiv Schreiber who essays a candidate in the presidential race rising up from his ranks as a celebrated war hero. But all is not clean in this urge for power. THe focal point of this power is then epitomised by Meryl Streep who plays the ambitious mother of Leiv trying to help him create an image of change for USA.What drives the plot is then the connection between the squad in Kuwait, all members having faded memories. What really happened? Was the congressional medal for honour mis directed to brew one of the infamous candidates for the post of president. How did the faded parts of the jigsaw piece together.How do they connect Washington and Schreiber?

153,vivesi-1,"Subtlety not lost, but willfully disregarded",3,4 August 2004,"Unraveling the mystery of the positive critical response to this piece of offensive nonsense has been exponentially more intriguing than the torture of actually watching the film. But I think I've got the answer, or at least part of it. Every once in a while a film comes along that critics would normally pan, but they don't do so because they think, on some level, that Americans are too stupid to figure out what's going on in this country politically. I just can't come up with any other reasonable answer because this is one of the worst films I've ever seen given everything it had going for it before filming. Others here have articulated the travesty far better than I can, so I'll just mention a couple of the gargantuan mistakes in order to vent a little. The Cold War threat was a fear that had some merit and people were truly uneasy about it. The threat of corporations running the American government is not a threat, but a widely accepted reality. Dear Demme: do you even know who George Bush and Dick Cheney are??? It's hard to invoke the eerie paranoia of the original film when our fears have been replaced with deep resignation. Oooo--scare me with rich, greedy capitalists controlling elections. I am not being cynical when I say that this is the reality, and everybody knows it. To make a film announcing that fact is ludicrous (and offensive). But that is only one of many reasons why the movie is so incredibly boring. Underlying the original film was a sense of bizarre humor, (remember the ladies tea party?) a sense of things going just a bit awry. This type of subtlety is far more intriguing (and frightening)than a director beating you on the head with blood and gore, pointless extreme close-ups, scenery-chewing, predictable dialogue, inept jump cuts, foolish star-packing (why have Miguel Ferrer if he's just going to stand around and look bewildered--do we NEED a recognizable actor for that role?)a blaring soundtrack, unclear exposition, zero regard for even minimal character development, and an ending that is far too long and far too pat.Now that I think about it, I'm glad this movie was made.

154,ecarle,A Mediocre Remake for Our Mediocre Political Times (SPOILERS),2,1 August 2004,"(SPOILERS for both the original and the remake) This was not a bad movie on its own terms. Good cast, stylish direction by Jonathan Demme (though now in his trademark style: huge close-ups of people looking right at the camera), some nice suspense. But everything  and I mean everything  that made the original 'Manchurian Candidate' an unforgettable classic has been forcibly removed or revamped into dumbed-down mediocrity for our sped-up, sound-bite-ridden, politicized times. Part of the problem, indeed , is that we can't make a 1962 movie today. We're way in the future now, and the quiet, rather straightforward simplicity of the original could not be put on the screen today (Van Sant tried it with his shot-by-shot 'Psycho' and it didn't work.)So instead of beginning (after a brief prologue) with a brilliant credit-sequence and David Amram's deeply sad and aching score, the new one begins with a herky-jerky burst of loud rock music and a helter-skelter barrage of images of war. It's 2004, kids, enough of that quiet emotional crap.  From the start, the original had emotional resonance via its music and credit portraits of the pensive lead players alone. From the start, the new movie has no emotional resonance at all. The biggest shock is how the emotion has been sucked out of the story, entirely. In the original, when Raymond killed the Senator and his daughter, the daughter was Raymond's new wife, the woman he deeply loved, the only person in the world who might possibly save Raymond from the pre-programmed horror of his life. Raymond's killing of those two people was the turning point of the entire film  and filmed by John Frankenheimer as a dazzling Wellesian cinema sequence with the symbolic wit of the film's dark comedy (the milquetoast liberal Senator dies shot through a carton of milk, his bleeding heart bleeding the milk of human kindness.) All gone now in the remake's bizarre attempt to merge the murder scene with Raymond's great 'jump in the lake' scene from the original. The Senator's daughter (who looks oddly like Marilyn Manson) barely cares about Raymond anymore. His killing her is of little emotional pain. The karate fight is gone, which means the new film is action-free, but something else important is missing: In the original, Raymond sees his 'houseboy,' and doesn't recognize him as the man who betrayed and tortured him. Marco sees the same 'houseboy,' recognizes him on sight, and launches his furious payback attack.There was a POINT to that. Raymond was weak, controllable. Marco was tough; his brainwashing didn't take. The contrast of tough Marco and sneering, weak Raymond, and their bonding as fellow brainwashees, was emotional and meaningful. The new Marco and Raymond prove, near the end, essentially interchangeable. The simply magnificent 'garden party' dream sequences of the original have been removed and replaced with generic herky-jerky mind-bend sequences (we saw just last week in 'The Bourne Supremacy.') The wonderfully symbolic playing cards/Queen of Diamonds theme has been replaced by the old microchips-planted-in-my-brain canard (we saw just last month in 'The Stepford Wives.') There is no longer a visual linkage between the Queen of Diamonds and Raymond's mother. The wonderful trigger line: 'Why don't you pass the time by playing a nice game of solitare?' has been replaced with a banal 'Sergeant Shaw. Sergeant Raymond Prentice Shaw'  so that when Streep utters the words, she had to bark them like some sort of nutcase drill sergeant (Lansbury simply offered the chilling invitation to her son.) Classic movies bring the right actors together in the right combination. As good as they are, none of the four leads here  Washington, Streep, Schreiber, Elise  make the emotional connection that their four forbears made. Streep is the worst, indulging her usual tics and self-referential mannerisms to make Mrs. Shaw a one-dimensional political ogre rather than the grand monster that Angela Lansbury was (here,the Manchurian Global baddies look at Steep near the end as if thinking 'We hired this idiot politician to front us?') Times being what they are, Streep will get an Oscar and mumble speeches like ""For little old me? I don't deserve this."" She doesn't. Washington is a highly skilled actor who captures this version of Marco well  but Sinatra's Marco was a tougher character (that karate fight) rendered far more sad and soulful in Sinatra's best performance. Sinatra was always a great singer of lost loves and causes  he carried that emotion forward to his work as Marco. Washington can play tough, but doesn't really get to, here. Washington's fierce intelligence also neutralizes his emotional connection to the story. It's not whether Sinatra or Washington is the better actor (both won Oscars), its Sinatra's fitting the tale better.Liev Schreiber has it in him to match Laurence Harvey's singular performance in the original (so unlovable  and yet so sad; a killer beyond his ability to control it), but the new script doesn't give Schreiber a chance.And yes, Rosie is explained in this movie  as a character we've seen in 100 movies and 1,000 TV shows. The mystery is gone. Kimberly Elise is given nothing new to play. And she is not the star -- yet -- that Janet Leigh was when she played the role. Identification with Leigh (right after ""Psycho"") was more intense. The ending of the new film mangles the meaning of the original. The switch of assassins requires the elimination of the tragedy of the original, and forces a expository epilogue in the modern 'gotta explain it all"" tradition.And the loss of Joe McCarthy, World Communism, the Chinese, the Russians, and the Koreans in favor of gutless Hollywood PC villainy (an evil corporation, white guys smoking cigars, and a South African white scientist) is standard issue. We've seen this movie before  and it wasn't 'The Manchurian Candidate.' That the new 'Manchurian Candidate' is worth seeing at all is because the source material is so good they can't totally wreck it, and because the star actors are interesting enough even if they never soar where the original took its characters. It's a three-star movie of four-star plus material, and in destroying virtually everything that made the original such a special film and great classic, the new 'Manchurian Candidate' deserves a drop of at least another star.",The Manchurian Candidate

I haven't seen the original one, nor have I read the book, but this is a fine film. The story follows a bit of a cliché--innocent soldiers caught in the web of maneuvering politicians and corporations--but it manages to create its moments of surprise and thrill.

158,nti-547-765973,A touching movie experience,9,9 May 2020,"Not having seen the original, not knowing this is a remake, judging it on its merits alone I found it an extraordinary achievement in cinema. In terms of acting Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep knocked out of the park. They were all superb in their own right. The theme of bioengineering is so present nowadays, as we are pretty much on the verge of brain implants, that it shudders one to think this was in the books even 16 years ago. It makes the movie a cautionary tale of sorts, as it is not so removed from reality now as it might have seemed when it was launched. They deal beautifully with the theme of free will and the capacity humans have for overriding and overcoming their own brain chemistry. If the theme were different maybe it would have been just a good political thriller but seeing how we might soon all have a choice to make on receiving this kind of outside interference into our body, its relevance amplifies the movies quality as a whole making it a touching movie experience.",The Manchurian Candidate
159,Moonhawk1975,"Anti-war film or tense, paranoid thriller? Demme fails to achieve either.",6,8 April 2005,"If ever there was a time for an anti-war film, it is now. Jonathan Demme seized the opportunity (or had the misfortune of bad timing) and remade the classic story of brainwashed soldiers (which I have not seen); a compelling idea, uninterestingly executed.The flashback sequences are not very involving and are so brief and sketchily shot that the viewer is unable to experience the terror that is intended. Denzel Washington (excellent as always as one of the soldiers) is reduced to running around trying to convince a presidential candidate (Liev Schreiber, another soldier) of the truth. It's a part that needed to have more conviction; as written he seems like a kook.The movie only succeeds when Meryl Streep is on the screen. Brilliant as always, she tears apart every scene she is in as the mother of Schreiber's character. Her scheming and manipulation are the highlights of the movie. Had it centered around her character, it would have been far better.",The Manchurian Candidate

161,surenm,This was a TERRIBLE film. Read why did I and others rated it a 1!,1,31 July 2004,"*READ AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM, CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS*For anyone who believes this movie was an excellent suspense thriller and a superb film...you have been brainwashed worse than Raymond Shaw.This film, or more importantly, this screenplay is only the latest entry exemplifying a very alarming trend in major Hollywood suspense thrillers. Most notably, the film `Godsend' came to mind almost immediately after seeing `The Manchurian Candidate' as a prime example of the same flaw, as well as to a lesser extent the films `Training Day' the cryptic Mamet thriller `Heist' and the `Indy' non-Hollywood but equally flawed (and for the same reason) `Cabin Fever.'What these films have in common is the single major problem with dramatic screenwriting today; the lack of a well-planned, well-executed, well-developed, payoff laden or at all logical third act.  For those who may not know what I'm talking about, if you were enjoying `Candidate' quite a bit as I did in the beginning, then felt it slowed down a little and got less scary and weird in the middle, but was still very entertaining, and then at the end took one of the biggest *dumps* (for lack of an expletive) that a bad script can, you've identified the problem too.  Think of the terrible plot holes and enormous flaws in the logic of the plot starting about half way through and getting worse and worse till the out-of-nowhere ending.  For instance, if these people, Manchurian Global, were able to do this kind of mind control effectively, why would they even have let Ben Marco go back to his normal life, why wouldn't he be as under control as Raymond Shaw all the time?  The answer, because then the movie would suck and the story would cease to exist.  Much more importantly, at the end, why or rather HOW could Marco fail in his objective to assassinate the president when in every other instance a mind controlled character does what they are told to do?  The answer, because then the movie would have ended on a logical, but unfortunate unhappy ending.  Is it an accident Marco killed the wrong people, did Manchurian Global give him another order AFTER `Mother' did?  If you start thinking about a number of things like this that happened as the film progressed and try and apply logic to them, you'll find yourself quite muddled and confused.  You'll be left with snippets of information and jumbled footage and scenes that paint a clear picture that some critical screen elements and scenes you needed to see are in fact completely missing. In addition to the horrendous third act, the general editing of the film was poor, even the opening credits sequence featured unhinged jump cuts and strangely juxtaposed sequences that were jarring at best.  This is what happens when an edited film is edited AGAIN, for the wrong reasons, and by the wrong people.  It's dumb Harvard MBA Studio Execs using bad box office science to make a BAD movie which tests extremely well with monkeys.The problem is that what was a good screenplay with several very interesting ideas and great political intrigue was either abruptly finished the way studio executives thought it should be without any concern for logic, story development, or the plot, or it was a major hack job on the third and most important act of the screenplay.  The film `Godsend' has this same problem, great first act, okay second act which starts to go bad half way through, and then a TERRIBLE third act and ending which ruined the whole film. `Heist' has a very similar problem, mainly third act related, and the list goes on, including `Cabin Fever' for example, same exact problem: cool idea, starts off great, then the third act comes and SUCKS.  `Training Day,' ironically another Denzel Washington film, also has this same problem, a BAD third act where everything starts unraveling the wrong way for no reason at all.  On that film I can at least say after hearing from the writers' own mouths at a Q&A that I know they were not to blame, as they had a much different ending in mind originally, then they were told what to change and how to change it.I urge you, please, DO NOT tolerate this kind of banality or we will as the `mindless' audience will continue to get films marketed on excellent, highly proficient and well-edited trailers as `Candidate' had, high levels of supposed intrigue, and great performances that fall apart like a house of cards the minute a single gust of `logic' is blown by way of the story.If you left the theatre entertained but unsatisfied, demystified, and feeling unfulfilled by this film and you don't know why, I've had the same dream too, it's not you, and it's not something you missed.  Other people seem to think there isn't a problem and that `everything is under perfect control' with this film, but it is not, there are major things wrong here that should have been fixed by any writer or studio executive with half a brain, but instead they were left blatantly exposed, like another huge logic plot hole concerning `Dr.' Noyle and why there were press clippings of him doing things for Manchurian Global and then AT THE SAME TIME press clippings and research saying that he's a known illegal, banned in Western countries certified `mad scientist.'  Keep thinking about that one for awhile, or just take some more of your medicine or turn on FOX to hear what MOTHER has to say.",The Manchurian Candidate
162,MB_West_Lafayette,Eerie,8,15 July 2017,"The resemblance of the far-fetched thesis to the current political climate made me feel uneasy. Take out the implants and the movie is no weirder than the present events. The plot is very clever. Denzel Washington is excellent and manages to pull together a difficult story line. Other actors are very good too. But the movie itself is uneven. I didn't like the over stimulus or the music score, but they are the fad. There are a couple of detail flaws too. Doesn't Marco know that bathroom sinks have removable traps? The oedipal relationship wasn't necessary either. In spite of these it is well worth watching.",The Manchurian Candidate
163,filmquestint,Senator Streep,1,24 March 2005,"The one and only reason to see this new and much weaker Manchurian Candidate is Meryl Streep. The little space allocated to her character makes the film rise to undeserving levels. True, I would pay to see Meryl Streep do the weather but that's quite besides the point. Even so, the memory of Angela Lansbury's performance in the role towers over Meryl Streep's, mostly because the original Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidte towers over Demme's. What a silly idea, really. To update the story doesn't contribute a thing to the results. No matter how many monitor screens and details about the experiment we're let into. We, quite simply, don't care. We care about the drama of that mother and son. Of the soldier's and their nightmares. But those elements are treated in a sketchy, sluggish way. Frank Sinatra gave a sterling performance in the original and we believed in his torment. Here Denzel Washington floats throughout the film without giving us the chance to connect the dots of his journey. Liev Schriver is a credible Raymond Shaw but the script doesn't help him to go where Laurence Harvey had ventured. After ""The Truth About Charlie"" I was fearful of what Jonathan Demme (the great man behind ""Silence of the Lambs"") would do with this classic black comedy but I went to see it anyway, because Meryl Streep was in it and because it was Demme again working with Dean Stockwell after that lovely romp they did together ""Married to the Mob"" but Stockell's work in Manchurian Candidate, how can I put it? If you blink you miss it. How strange. How disappointing. However, the scenes with Senator Meryl Streep are worth the price of admission.",The Manchurian Candidate
164,toddinvestor,Disturbing content,2,19 August 2004,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" may have had strong acting and a measure of suspense throughout. I thought Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and even Liev Schreiber all provided convincing roles. The movie also maintained an ongoing creepy air adding to its 'thriller' status. But unlike ""The Sixth Sense"", for example, which emphasized story and characters over blood and gore, ""The Manchurian Candidate"" relies too heavily on disturbing visuals for impact. In addition to the entire story being based on a brainwashing, violence in this film includes drownings, asphyxiations, torture and point blank shootings. Such material could have been implied rather than vividly shown. It becomes the focal point of the film detracting from everything else. That is not what I go to the movies for. 2/10",The Manchurian Candidate
165,gcatelli,the usual suspects {spoilers},9,19 August 2004,"if you're utterly clueless, you probably imagine that off-and-on for the past 2500 years there has been a life-or-death struggle between western notions of the primacy of individual choice and a variety of communitarian polities from the east determined to stamp out individualism. if you're particularly dull, you might think that since 1940 or so, America has been, in the words of Polish-born writer Ted Morgan, the ""world's last best hope"" against economic totalitarianism (communism), racial totalitarianism (fascism), and now religious totalitarianism (Islamic fundamentalism).but, as everyone who's anyone in the world of the arts or the life of the mind knows, the real ""enemy"" {sic} is ""rich people"" {sic}, global capitalism, an assertive American patriotism, and, though it dare not be said aloud, the type of Christian who raises her hand and says, ""I'm a believer"". in a word, Republicans. fortunately, those of us who were still in the dark now have a remake of The Manchurian Candidate to clue us in as to who the ""enemy"" really is, and how this enemy goes about trying to steal away our democracy (such as it is). it seems that a multinational corporation indistinguishable from Haliburton has hired a mad scientist (naturally, he's from South Africa) who uses the knowledge he gained making genetically modified tomatoes to implant microchips just beneath the skin of those whom the enemy would control. how do these microchips do this? no one knows -- except the mad scientist. oh, and there's something about belly dancers with faces covered with tattoos who carry around red, white, and blue models of the human brain accompanied by weird music. is that clear? if it's not, you're obviously some kind of Republican.but, the reason for going to see this movie is not for its coherence on the subjects of politics and science. rather, it's to see how the supreme diva of all Hollywood, Meryl Streep (still drop-dead gorgeous at age 55), measures up to Angela Lansbury as the most over-the-top emotionally controlling mother in the history of cinema. let's just say: if *that's* your reason for seeing this film, you won't be disappointed.it's also a pleasure to watch Denzel Washington as Major Marco (doing his best Colin Powell imitation), Kimberly Elise as a very believable heroine whose role is much juicier than in the original version, and Liev Schreiber as a much more likable Raymond Shaw than the effete impudent snob that Laurence Harvey portrayed. along with Ms. Streep, they should cop nominations for best actor and actress and best supporting actor and actress. but, from the point of view of pure acting, no one deserves an Oscar more than Jeffrey Wright, as one of the hapless members of Marco's and Shaw's unit in Kuwait. bottom line: like the original, a couple of hours of silly but enjoyably star-powered Hollywood escapism.",The Manchurian Candidate
166,tghoneyc,"Elevated by performances, hampered by source material",6,28 August 2005,"I will start out by saying that based on the source material - a brilliant satire taking swings alternately at Joe McCarthy and the Korean War with alternate hilarity and shock - this movie failed miserably. We live in a time when the new communism is Islam and terrorism. We are in the middle of a war many believe is only hurting us at this point, where the cause does not justify the means.One could see a gold mine of opportunity for resurrecting the satirical spirit of Richard Condon's novel, and John Frankenheimer's classic. When the black-list has been replaced by detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Jonathan Demme strives to walk a tight-rope between Left and Right, making a film that could have spoken volumes about our current climate, and done as Condon and Frankenheimer did, by dissing both extremes. (When the original film first opened, Condon was pleased to see Communists picketing the film in Paris, and American Legion picketing in Orange County, CA) ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was not meant to cater to all markets. It doesn't still, because certain individuals claim it's hitting out at the Bush camp. And why is that? Because they think everyone's contracted Michael Moore syndrome or something? Or is it just because Al Franken makes an appearance as a news reporter? In truth, Demme's version, while creating a fairly believable alternate world where the same modern situations are occurring in countries with different names than, say, Iraq.Now to my other point. Sure, the movie could use some of the black humor Axelrod's original script offered up. But it doesn't. Instead, we are treated to a vaguely similar script where events have been reshaped to better fit an unbiased modern America. This would hardly be worth our time if not for some excellent acting.Denzel Washington has had roles as good as this before, but I've never seen him in such a wildly ambiguous role as our default hero who becomes so completely obsessed and paranoid with the world around him that he even tries to murder his girlfriend! We know he's the good guy, because we know what's going on isn't just in his head, but how far is he willing to go to find out the truth? Admittedly, Sinatra never strived for this kind of psychosis.Equally good is Meryl Streep as a bitch you just love to hate. She's not the quietly manipulative matriarch Angela Lansbury introduced us to, nor the ambitious seductress of Condon's original book. She is a first-class predator, looking to have her cake and eat it to.Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, and Jeffrey Wright also give fine portrayals. But Liev Schreiber, as the title character (or is he?) is woefully underused. What ever happened to the love-hate relationship between Raymond and his mother? What about his close bond to Ben Marco, that here goes as far as Marco biting his shoulder, shrugged off as a man gone mad. Laurence Harvey's Raymond was hard to like, and even harder to dislike. Schreiber, who is usually surprisingly good, is an absolute bore.In the end the changes to the story don't disappoint for people expecting the same old thing, but there are uneven plot holes to this conclusion, and it leaves one desiring more of an explanation.I strongly recommend you read Condon's absolutely scathing novel. Or at least give the 1962 version a try.",The Manchurian Candidate
167,Nefi,"so many talking heads, so much boredom",1,22 December 2004,"I'm really angry at the makers of this film. They took one of the greatest films of all time and made a total mess out of it. Generally I'm in favor of remakes if they are done effectively and any update of an older film has my interest automatically before seeing a single frame. That's why I was so disappointed with the new ""Manchurian Candidate"". Actually they shouldn't have bothered to call it that way, there are that few things in common between the two films. Only the basic idea is there and the rest is changed entirely. I cannot remember the last time I was this much bored in a movie. There is zero energy throughout the proceedings and it doesn't help that all the actors deliver their lines in hushed tones without any reason. The sound mix is horrible, one of the worst I've heard in any Hollywood movie. The dialogue track is inconsistent resulting in different levels of speaking tones for all the actors. The cinematography is unexciting and unnecessarily hazy. There are many extreme closeups just for the sake of visual dressing which only serve to draw unnecessary attention towards the huge nostrils of Liev Schreiber (a huge disappointment of a performance by the way, I think this may halt any further hopes of him emerging as a leading man. He's simply not sufficient as an actor). Denzel Washington is yet another example for the curse of the Academy Award as he continues his downfall both in respect of the quality of his films and the monotonousness of his performances. Nothing exciting here about him either. Which leaves Meryl Streep and even she is only so-so. (The viciousness of Angela Lansbury's performance is very much missed.) It's as if director Demme intentionally sucked the life out of his performers to put the viewer into a deliberate state of hypnosis so that it would suit the theme of the film! As another reviewer noticed, the rally sequences are glaringly fake and it was so apparent that Liev Schreiber was delivering his so-called motivating speeches in front of a camera by himself. It is unforgivable to remake the original only to omit everything, I repeat, everything that gave it its charm: no Queen of Hearts, no kung-fu sequence, no jumping at the lake, no strange and to-date-still-undecipherable dialogue sequence at the train, no brainwashing sequence, no idyllic summer by the river for Shaw with his beloved and her father... The list goes saddeningly on and on. By the 90-minute mark I was so turned off by the whole thing that I walked off it without any single trace of regret. (Something which I never do during such high profile movies.) Besides director Demme I think this whole fiasco was due to the part of producer Scott Rudin whose films have always promised but never quite delivered (as exemplified previously by the First Wives Club and the Stepford Wives). For a change he tried drama but here his failure is more in your face since there is no wild histrionics of a comedy to save the day. Definitely not recommended....",The Manchurian Candidate
168,atlant,"Ahh, another movie with a bi-modal rating distribution!",9,31 July 2004,"Let's get one thing out of the way early: This is *NOT* a direct re-make of the 1962 movie. While many characters, pieces of the plot, and even lines in the screenplay come directly from  the '62 movie, a few critical plot elements have been substantially altered. It's rather fun to see one movie and then the other, just to spot the similarities and the differences. (Rather than post them as spoilers, I'll leave finding these difference and similarities as an exercise for the viewer.)More importantly, both are fine movies. In this new version, Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Shreiber all give strong performances. The new movie is probably more accessible to modern audiences, following modern movie sensibilities whereas the '62 version is clearly of that period. The new movie is grittier and harder hitting, and I was spell- bound from the first frame to the last. This movie doesn't pull emotions out of the viewer with artificial tricks; instead, you will deeply care about the characters as the plot unfolds.Finally, it's also interesting to note how deeply this movie apparently offends a certain subset of the IMDB readership. Like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", a large number of reviewers are giving this movie a rating of ""1"" simply because it strikes a bit too close to where they live. I think you can safely disregard all of the ""1"" ratings.I'm not applying any political spin to my review but rather, simply reviewing it as a movie: 9 out of 10.",The Manchurian Candidate

However, Marco begins to have realistic and frightening dreams that make him question what really happened and question his sanity.Perhaps my enjoyment of this movie is low because I have read the novel, and the movie is different (and diminished) in several aspects. By changing the storyline and omitting two characters, the ending of the movie is weaker than the novel and the movie looses its 'spy' feel. Both Washington and Schreiber perform well and the supporting cast does a good job also. But it's just not a top movie take the time to read the book instead.

170,ennyman,Better than expected,8,17 July 2007,"Just finished watching this remake starring Denzel Washington, who is always superb. Before watching this film, I watched the original Manchurian Candidate which received such high marks that it seemed difficult for this movie to compete at any level. Well, happily I found out different. This is a high quality film, well conceived, well produced. All of the actors/actresses are giving it their best and the modernized storyline ""works"" -- which is the true measure of any creative endeavor in film.I do not relate to the complainers who say this is an awful and unnecessary remake. The original is well done, but probably overrated. And the cold war context has no equivalent modern relevance. So, a re-make is complete acceptable.One criticism leveled at this film is the casting of a Big Corporation as the bad guy, as opposed to communist North Korean mind-benders. As an entertainment, this is an acceptable ""bad guy"", even if such portrayals of Big Business have almost become a Hollywood cliché. I did not have a huge problem with this storyline since to some extent future history remains unwritten and the overt influence of Business on Politics is no secret.A more problematic aspect of the film is that its first half hour may be too complicated and confusing for someone who has not seen the original Manchurian Candidate. The story line is original in the Original version, and though re-packaged this time around and not utterly ""new"" it has enough variance that you do not know what will happen next, and you care enough about Denzel's character that you do want to know what will happen next. This is the essence of story: you care and do not know what will happen. This is what keeps people turning the pages in a good book. And here in this movie, if you could predict the ending it would not keep you watching. Too faithful to the original and it would have been a letdown.A very good film, and well worth the time and rental fees.",The Manchurian Candidate

For those of us old enough to have seen the original in its first release, in a theatre, the experience cannot be relived. This is a very bad movie, without an original thought to place it in any kind of meaningful context. It is not black comedy and not really a political thriller. If you think corporations control politics, then what makes you think they need to go to all this trouble to have their own president? Just write a check. The performances are ones that the prinicipal players will learn to live down. Washington, Streep and Schreiber are all wasted, as though they know this material is far beneath them but they are working hard anyway. Any discussion of ""how it compares to the original"" are, in my opinion, a complete waste of time. As a remake it is not even close, so I look at it on its own merits: on this scale it is an utter flop.

Al Franken's appearance in the opening of the movie is the director's way of letting us know that this is actually a subtle anti-Republican flick. This time, instead of the Chinese being the ones who brainwash the soldiers, we have a US Corporation (Manchurian Global) which goes beyond simple brainwashing to implants to carry out their evil ways. Meryl Streep does a poor job of pulling off Shaw's mother - Angela Lansbury was much better in the original. This movie is like a jigsaw puzzle, with lots of pieces missing.

Suddenly, a patrol brainwashed as Korean PoWs becomes a patrol brainwashed by an American company  surely hard for even die-hard conspiracy theorists to swallow. Just looking at the cast list tells you who the hero is, as Denzel Washington is so averse to playing bad guys (though he usually does a good job of doing so when he dares to try). Similarly, the bad guy, in line with well-accepted Hollywood tradition, has to be a foreigner, in this case a South African scientist  with no trace of South African accent. Similarly, why does a large American private equity company choose to name itself after a Chinese region  Manchuria?

This could have easily been a X-Files-episode-gone-bad, had it not been for its 2 hour(!!) playtime.2) IT IS YET ANOTHER REMAKE! If the original is as good as some people say (I haven't seen it) then why was this movie made? The reason remakes are all the rage now, is because the original script has already proved itself, which reduces the risks of creating a flop. Just add a few changes and updates and presto: another box office hit. Another cheap, unoriginal and pointless movie that generates millions in ticket and DVD sales.

The politicians are portrayed as fools, and in this respect, so is the audience. There's only one man who suspects that all is not as it seems.

It seems that the problem in this film was in the editing...the directing...some studio hack job on the directors cut? Perhaps they wanted it to feel documentaryish?

180,JonWatches,Hollywoodization rather than cinema...but with some moments,4,19 August 2006,"**TOTAL SPOILER**The Manchurian Candidate (2004) is to the genre what I, Robot is to science fiction...not really bad, not good, rehashed, leaky in plot and structure, but entertaining enough not to feel like the film was a complete waste of money.In other words, the adage about remakes stands. I paid $4 for the DVD and think I wasted about $1.50 of that. Just like the (did he leave or was he offed?) Albanian brain-meister said, the plot could have centered on good drugs and sleep deprivation (and some gene therapy?) rather than IMPLANTS that take years to surface, but can be bit out of any given shoulder. Imagine the kind of hole you'd have to make, really... Oh, and if I had just pulled out something someone had implanted under my skin I would 1)take off the drain trap to retrieve it and 2)not remove the next one from my mouth over another sink! The $2.50 I didn't feel I'd wasted was seeing the close coverage of Meryl Streep playing a heavy, the fact that Ray Shaw was a pawn not a bad-guy per se, and the idea that the male bonding between Shaw and Marco was enough to foil the Manchurian scheme...in fact, I think the idea that these two men had shared something (and thus Shaw swerved from the star) was the only screen-play-worthy part of the film, the only real MEANING in the picture. Oh, the line from Rosie that she'd ""made a decision"" when she first met Marco was, if a little corny, worthy...don't we, in fact, later make big decisions that are really based on snap choices in our past?

The few times he smiles or snickers (okay, scoffs with a smile) in the movie are a ray of sunshine just for its variety.The movie IS intense, a taunt thriller that, at times, delivers a creepier sensation that most horror movies. Yet, in the end, I found it rather predictable. Though the filmmakers to do get maximum mileage out of the two major plot twists. (Spoiler ahead!) Of course the check-out girl was part of the government. Small twist, she was on Denzel's side. Plot twist two (another spoiler): Denzel is still under control of the Manchurians. Hm, okay.

All for the benefit of the CEO's and shareholders.This power has been at least curtailed for now with a new house and senate in power.Streep does a very fine job in her role; grasping, disgustingly ambitious to the point of murdering people, she epitomizes just about Everything wrong with the USA in the early 21st century.Denzel Washington plays the micro chipped brainwashed burned out veteran with much pain and emotional dissonance.

Here he prevents the viewer from being distracted into keeping active count of the differences between his film and the original; the viewer can relax and watch an ""original"" film from the beginning. Demme immediately establishes his own distinctive approach: Bring characterization to the foreground. The original was compelling mainly due to its novel and intricate plot, but the acting was no-frills. Demme and his actors -- Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, Liev Schreiber (and even minor players like Jeffrey Wright) -- create characters that are fleshed-out and human. They are far from the chess pieces of the original and thus better draw us into the film, offering the viewer an emotional entry point and a rooting human interest from beginning to end. While not superior to the original -- conspiracies in of themselves simply have lost their ability to shock these days -- the new ""Candidate"" achieves its own success by being a rare thriller: one that is emotionally moving.",The Manchurian Candidate

What a disappointment!  I loved the original.  This version was indeed a ""remake"" with changes to update the story: it's not communism that's the villain anymore but a global corporation that wants to control the American government (why not other governments, too?) and that captures a unit during Desert Storm, brainwashes them, etc.  Screwing with the ending was a huge mistake and didn't make much sense.  I like my paranoid nightmares straightforward and scary, not all messed up and unintelligible. (smile) Having said that, Meryl Streep provides work yet again that shows why she's one of the best actors around, and Liev Schrieber nails Raymond.  Denzel is always enjoyable but I don't think this is his best work.  I can't even say this was a nice try, although I admire Jonathan Demme's direction and his efforts with this script.

But good God, how could you take such treasure and waste it so utterly?The original, although dressed as a political thriller (and thrilling it is, and smart, startling) is, at it's heart, a love story. The relationship between Raymond & Josie is developed delicately, reflecting its fragile nature and Raymond's inability to give himself to it fully. It finally comes to fruition and then it is then destroyed, wantonly, in one of cinema's most harrowing moments.Demme and his writers negate this completely; there is no love story here. There is no tragedy in Raymond Shaw and because of this, no sympathy for him from the viewer. There is no heart here, at all.",The Manchurian Candidate
186,fudanchu-725-268123,Great political thriller that matches its predecessor,10,27 January 2018,"I am a huge fan of the original film, and when I first saw the remake I disliked it. It is impossible for me to go back to my thoughts at the time, because now I believe that if anything the Jonathan Demme version is better. But it does not have to be better to be superb. Denzel Washington gives the performance of a lifetime (except of course he has given many performances of a lifetime) as a lonely Gulf War veteran suffering from some very troubling dreams. He simply lives the character of a once strong man reduced to a humiliating marginal life, not comprehending how he has come to this point or why. He slowly gets purpose back in his life as he investigates the basis for his dreams. Meryl Streep similarly embodies the role of the senator and mother who uses her son for political advantage. The scene where she persuades her colleagues to support her son as the VP candidate is perfect. Similarly, Liev Schreiber is awesome as Raymond Shaw the son whose values are so different from his mother's, and who is one of the main victims of the Manchurian conspiracy. Two reasons for preferring the remake. First, the performances are overall stronger, or perhaps its just that the characters are more believable. In particular, Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise outshine Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh. This does not apply to Angela Lansbury of course. Second, the plot of the original has been changed to make it more credible. In the original one puzzle is why Raymond Shaw, the son of a prominent politician, is being used as an assassin. George Axelrod, the original scriptwriter, explained this with some great dialogue, but this question is resolved differently and more sensibly (and more frighteningly) in the remake. Finally, the ending of the remake is much richer. Its hard to say much more but I have found that with each viewing I have come to appreciate the new ending more and more. I love the final lines from the original of course, but the final moments of the remake reflect the fact that Jonathan Demme was perhaps a more human-centred director than John Frankenheimer. Interestingly, the Frankenheimer film that is closest to this Manchurian candidate in tone is perhaps Seconds, and it is clear from that comparison that what Demme does effortlessly comes with effort to Frankenheimer. (Although I would not have suggested Demme for The Train, or French Connection 2 or Grand Prix). The only things I absolutely prefer in the original are the trigger words ""why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire"" (which are kind of silly but unforgettable and chilling) and the scene between Raymond and his mother Eleanor when she gives him his instructions and justifies her choices.",The Manchurian Candidate

188,telltime,"Watch the original, not this remake.",4,7 January 2021,"Mr. Washington and Mr. Schreiber are fantastic in their roles. Unfortunately, that is not enough to make this anything close to the drama built up in the original. This version is too predictable and takes some deviant turns (the implied nature of the ""relationship"" between the VP and Manchurian candidate and his mother, the senator). And it was completely unnecessary as the all-controlling, domineering personality was more than enough.I don't want to go into details for those of you that have seen the original and my want to still see this one. But... I was disappointed in some of the switches they made in roles. An example that won't spoil anything is where the name Manchuria came from. It had to be done because of geographic differences between Korea (the original) and Kuwait (this version), so that one I can live with. But moving around who does what, and removal of a very important love interest story essential in the first movie made this version much more predictable and the ending much less shocking. It erased that feeling one realizes when something is overcome. And changing the ""trigger"" to what altered behaviors also removed any erratic happenings that made the candidate suspect something was off, which was used very effectively in the original movie.It's not the worse movie I ever say, but if you want to see a good story about deep-state political ambition and conspiracy, watch the original version with Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury.",The Manchurian Candidate

191,kareem-1,1962 v. 2004,6,2 October 2005,"I must say that over the years I've grown to think of the Manchurian Candidate (1962) as one of the finest movies made . Nevertheless, I was seriously concerned about the merits of re-making such an amazing movie. Unfortunately; we live in a time when the re-makes often end up destroying every good intention that was weaved into the art of the original.With that being said, I sat here and watched the 2004 version and I must say, Demme tried way too hard to make the past come alive in this, Washington in to Sinatra, Scheiber into Harvey, Streep into Lansbury, and the worst example of this comes in the form of Elise into Leigh. Elise pulls off one of the worst performances I've seen on film in a long time (HomeGirl lives in NY, but works in DC at a Supermarket and pays rent on what looks to be the quintessential 3500 per month, 3rd floor walk-up). Keeping 1960's phone numbers (Eldorado 6599 or whatever it was) in a 10 digit setting is pretty ridiculous in itself. OKay, maybe I'm a little-more critical of the new, trying to take over the from the classics of American cinema. But this movie (possibly) shouldn't have been made (at least not in the manner in which it was). Come on, everybody knows kids don't go to school on Election Day. And... they got Alabama to go blue - what's up with that. Sorry, Demme (nevertheless, I did love Bruce Springsteen: The Complete Video Anthology) but this is a bit more serious than a New Order Video. The Inclusion of Al Franken and Beau Sia was nice though. That side of the movie gets a 4.On the other hand, and hour and a half into the movie Streep, Voight, Schreiber and Elise all of a sudden come alive and start delivering relatively good performances. Although Elise as a ""fed"" still kinda sucks. Streep still ends up being somewhat a shadow to Lansbury. However still a scary character, she lacks the nasty GOP scowl that Angela brought to the fray. She does pull out the sort of performance that a crazed Condeleeza would in reality, if she wasn't a spinster, and was in Streep/ Lansbury's shoes. She would certainly give her kid ""every opportunity"" to rule the world. Schreiber on the other hand sacrificing himself rather than the Prez. was rather interesting. This side of the movie gets an 8. Strange, how much a movie can change in 45 minutes. So then the question is, is the whole of the movie worth more than the majority.

Revealing what happened so early both detracts from the detective story (""what can be happening here?"") and the thriller (""maybe he's really delusional?"").How the story is finally resolved is a complete mystery, and breaks the fundamental rules the plot is build on.That said, there's nothing wrong with the performances, one plot twist was unexpected, and a few scenes are creepy in the right way.",The Manchurian Candidate

In some part of Raymond's life, he be alone from his mother and at these times he could work against her, at least after she demand's that Raymond kill's the father of his one-and-only love, who he actually also kills, without fighting his mother.

198,baenos,Better than the original,8,21 August 2004,"I know, I know, I'm committing sacrilege here, but remember that this is all opinion anyway, so who really cares?  I'll just give a few reasons why I think this is the better film.First, the direction is better.  I personally find John Frankenheimer's (director of the original) directorial style very ordinary; it's very understated and doesn't really distinguish itself.  Jonathan Demme directs the remake with a certain substantive flair, augmenting cuts and scenes with appropriate sound or color/lighting touches that support the feeling of the enveloping, oblique conspiracy that the story presents.The acting is superior here as well, at least in some instances.  Frank Sinatra's character is handled by Denzel Washington, who brings the skill that is needed for that particular role.  Sinatra's Marco responded to his stifling predicament by looking drained and impassive all the time.  I think the character needed a more kinetic aspect to his reactions, and Washington supplies that without going overboard.  His transition from normal to desperate may seem a little baffling as you try to pinpoint exactly when his change in attitude towards the situation takes place, but that personally didn't bother me-- I consider it a triviality in the face of his overall accomplishment because he effectively gives us a man trying to break free from constrictive circumstances.  Meryl Streep is certainly competent as Eleanor Shaw, of course more than just competent, but her depiction is a little more aggressive where Angela Lansbury's was staid and aloof, which I liked better.  No one turns in a truly weak performance, though.And I have to say, to my own observations, the overt ""cheese factor"" was turned down quite a bit.  In particular, I thought the kung fu fight in the original was completely stupid.  Just because one guy is Chinese and the other fought in Korea, they're both supposed to know kung fu?  Come on.  And the trigger of the brainwashing technique required Raymond Shaw to reach the queen of hearts (I think) in a game of solitaire before he was at their command.  I know the reason they give for that, but it still seemed an unnecessarily convoluted way to ""activate"" him.  These perceptions, though, could all be attributable to my age and the times I've grown up in; perhaps these elements didn't seem as overblown then as they do now.  And I'm sure plenty of folks will consider many elements in the remake to be cheesy; it's all a matter of personal taste.  I liked this film quite a bit: I thought it was well-executed and relatively believable as far as these things go.  Well worth watching.",The Manchurian Candidate
199,Videofilm,Lacking (more than) something!,5,1 August 2004,"I have not seen the original Manchurian Candidate so I really did not have particular expectations of this movie other than good acting from some very notable performers. But even these actors could not save it for me. The movie has moments but it left me unsatisfied.  The setup is intriguing but then the story gets bogged down and jumbled. In the end I could not really make sense of what had just happened. It seems that they tried to pass fiction as stranger than truth, which is probably why I missed it. The logic of what I had witnessed did not flow for me.  I think the movie totally botches the portrayal of technology.  It's a shame. They had chances.  And Jon Voit was wasted in this movie, apparently added for more box office star power as if they really needed it with Streep and Washington.

The acting is excellent, it is well directed, and its subject has been made timely.However, I do have a problem with the film. My problem is with the title. I believe the only reason it is titled ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was to benefit from the aura and popularity of the original 1962 film. In the new film it is a different war, a different era, a different manipulative international force, a different method of control, and more than one assassin. The way they managed to include the name ""Manchurian"" in this movie was a real stretch.

I left unsatisfied. Only the night before one of the TV channels was showing the original 1962 movie starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury. I could not focus on it for long because it could not grab my full attention. So I decided to skip it and watch the new one.The new one with Denzel Washington seemed to have an ""updated"" story line than what Richard Gordon had written in 1959. There was no such thing as the Korean War, or China ""programming"" soldiers, or Angela Lansbury playing the KGB agent in this movie.Just like Eric Bana seemed to have out performed Brad Pitt in Troy, Liev Schreiber seemed to have done the same over Denzel Washington.

I am for one someone who likes newer made movies mostly cause special effects and props are better for the eye besides b/w vs color. Further lots of old movies have good actors, but mainly actors playing themselves other than living into the moviepersonage, nowadays top actors like meryl streep and denzell washington can be someone else every time they play a new role, accent, appearance and so on, whereas Gregory peck, John Wayne and others just are themselves.I enjoyed this movie sitting upright(instead of laying down what I mostly do), top rank thriller, superb acting, who cares about a movie of some 30 odd years ago with some dinosaurs..... I prefer to see remakes(with top actors that is) over originals of 30 years and longer ago anytime, OK maybe there are exceptions of this rule there always are.....I yet have to see the first movie with streep and washington which was not good!",The Manchurian Candidate
204,alex_imdb,Enjoyable if you can come to terms with how phony it is.,6,8 January 2005,"A fairly watchable movie. The story is pretty tense, as it is common for the ""I lost my memories"" stories, besides, the idea of soldiers having strange memories and contradicting dreams about the wartime is a gold mine, and it fits just about right in the current political situation. So what do we do? We dig the gold. Right? Nevertheless, after about 15 minutes you can figure out what's happening, and 5 minutes after that you hear it all said in plain English, so there's no much intrigue about it. But between director, cameraman and editor, with some help from the actors, they managed to keep the movie watchable till its end.The acting is very good, Denzel Washington is amazing depicting a paranoidal soldier, but Meryl Streep's character is so much one-sided that I see nothing to talk about there: good performance, but it would fit better in a comic book adaptation. It's a shame they didn't use Meryl's dramatic talent more, they could have. I think it's about the script and directing.One thing I'd like to mention: there's a strange theatrical feeling about this movie, kind of similar to Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"". Something grotesque and out of place. Like the director was consciously but subtly trying to convert this somewhat serious script into a farce.Probably it's because this is a remake of something pretty much old, and here and there you can see the old dusty skeleton under the new flashy clothing. Bizarre. The ""secret laboratory"" scenes looked like a stylistic tribute to the 60ies' James Bond movies, or probably to the original ""...Candidate"".All in all, the movie is pretty solid for a remake, though the farce notes make it look not as serious as it could have been.

According to his dreams, what really happened is they were all captured by the enemy, who put these electrodes into their bodies and now has the power to control them.When he realizes that the candidate for Vice-President of the United States also must have the same electrodes planted throughout his body and even in his brain, the plot becomes evident. The Candidate has become a robot controlled by Manchurian Global to take over the Government of the United States and then the world. When Denzel tries to tell the authorities about this, they decide that he too is a victim of the Gulf War Syndrome.The candidate's manipulative and controlling mother, who is in on the plot, is brilliantly played by Meryl Streep. I remember Meryl Streep as a young ingénue. I never realized what a great actress she was until I saw this movie.This is essentially a remake of a 1962 movie by the same name. In the original, they were all captured during the Korean War and sent across the border to Manchuria in China for brainwashing, hence the name.I am sure that this movie did not help the candidacy of John Kerry when he ran for President. It will certainly be devastating to the candidacy of John McCain should he ever get the nomination, since McCain really was captured by the enemy.

206,duluman,might be the best remake i've seen,10,23 November 2004,"I must first say I am a huge fan of the original Frankenheimer film so I was very worried about this film but it finally it might be the best remake I've seen. Completes and updates the original and transforms it into something else. It also perfectly works in color (unlike the wasted Psycho). The actors are fantastic and the film is very Today. Very paranoid, a dark view on America as a fascist state. The plot works even better than on the original, with the global corporations and the fact that now we know so much about brainwashing.This and The last Embrace are the most De Palma / Hitchcock Demme films. Would have been totally unbelievable if De Palma would have directed it (as he was for a moment attached)and add his updated riffs on Phantom, Blow Out and Snake Eyes. Two more filmic clues I contemplate, The Parallax View and Jacob's Ladder and a guilty pleasure, Nick of Time (that came out of The Man Who Knew Too Much). Not many people from the mass audience saw the original, that was an uncanny infamous premonition on JFK's assassination, and a film ahead its time but more a sensationalist thriller than a major political statement. The Demme version is a film of our time and a subversive piece in an age in which, as a paradox, it's harder to do this kind of film than it was 40 years ago. 10/10",The Manchurian Candidate
207,DerrickLyle2004,"Great update, and the film stands on its own",10,8 May 2006,"I won't give anything away, but if you are a fan of the original 1962 motion picture, the 2004 incarnation of The Manchurian Candidate won't disappoint. Because it's a thriller, I'm going to be short and sweet...but the film does succeed in standing on its own. The cast, the characters, the plot and pacing come together to create an updated classic. It's ironic that this incarnation may indeed become a cult classic in its own right. I think this version, Red Dragon, and Batman Begins are three of the best updates/remakes I've seen lately.Whether you watch this film on cable, or get the DVD, you'll be pleased at what is truly a modern day classic. Like all good thrillers, be patient, and another thing: I know it's tempting, but try to view the film in its own context, and not beside the 1962 motion picture.

210,stush,Only One Reason to See this Movie: Meryl Streep...,4,2 August 2004,"...too bad there's about 110 more minutes that don't include her character.It's bad when a thriller is ho-hum and this is one of those. The cast is solid but the screenplay lacks any suspense. It also lacks a backbone. Which party do the different politicians represent? What is the main reason for paranoia? After the 2000 election are we supposed to be shocked that money not the voters select the president?Denzel Washington is, as always, affecting as the main character. I was distracted by his character because he brought to mind his character in another Gulf War themed movie, ""Courage Under Fire"" and the similarities of the character's motive: finding out the truth about what happened. Meryl Streep's performance is the only thing with which to recommend anyone see this film. However, her performance doesn't hold a candle to the comparable role in the original movie played by Angela Lansbury. Jonathan Demme should stick to original screenplays instead of lackluster remakes of classic movies that are in no need of being remade, ie. this one and ""The Truth About Charlie"" (""Charade"").",The Manchurian Candidate
211,brewsterlewster,HOLD YOUR REVIEWS UNTIL YOU SEE A FILM!,6,28 July 2004,Why be prejudgmental and look like a knee-jerk jerk.  See the film first!  I just saw it in a sneak preview in Maine.  It is nothing special but deserves a 6 or 7 for being somewhat creative in its cinematography and excellent acting.  Overall it is very a predictable Hollywood movie with large holes and uninteresting dialogue.  Even the Oedipal theme was obvious from the beginning.  The references to current political events is pretty funny.  But come on folks!  We don't need such sci-fi schemes to put corporate megalomania in the white house. AHEM...WHO IS IN THAT HOUSE RIGHT NOW?????????!!!!!! BOTTOM LINE:  It's worth viewing if you have nothing else to do.,The Manchurian Candidate
212,sandpuppy,Corporations R Us,9,2 August 2004,"You know, it's been so long since a political thriller has hit the theaters, I'd almost forgotten that they even existed at one time. This one is of course a remake - I mean, how else are you going to get anyone interested in this sort of material nowadays without having some CGI or a hero prancing about in tights and a cape? - but I will try to review it on its own terms.The story opens with a group of marines doing some recon work in Kuwait in the days before The first Gulf War. They get ambushed, mayhem ensues, and the next thing everyone knows, it's several years later, and the troop's leader, Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is addressing some boy scouts about the Congressional Medal of Honor which was awarded not to him, but one of his men. That guy's name is Raymond Shaw, and he's a politician these days, and one being groomed for the vice-presidency in the upcoming presidential election. Apparently the only thing on his resume that warrants qualification is the medal he won for fighting off the ambush and saving most of his squad. No mention is made of his purple hearts, though. Shaw's mom (Meryl Streep) is a high ranking senator and she's pushing real hard to get her boy into the White House. At the party's convention, she brow-beats an entire room of Democrat bigwigs into changing their minds from selecting Jon Voight as their veep candidate to choosing her son. After all, Raymond won the Medal of Honor defending US soldiers from an Iraqi ambush, while Voight couldn't even save Ned Beatty from those two hillbillies down by the river.Marco begins suspecting something isn't right about all this. He has dreams about that night in Kuwait. Maybe Shaw didn't deserve do anything to deserve that Medal. Maybe Shaw didn't do anything at all. Maybe some Cup-O-Noodles would really hit the spot. He then begins to piece together the strong possibility that his entire squad was really only brainwashed into thinking Shaw had saved them and that they were coerced into working together to help him get his Medal, which would in turn, get him into the White House. Because as we know, it's all about the medals and connections when it comes to choosing our next leader. Ideas and administrative accomplishments mean zip. Anyway, all this appears to be orchestrated by an outfit called Manchurian Global, a big time defense contractor that gets no-bid military contracts and seems to enjoy other wartime pursuits.This is probably the biggest obstacle in the movie. You might say to yourself ""Whoa! A mega-corporation engineering what goes on in the White House?! No way!"" and then you might wonder why Manchurian Global is going through so much trouble to achieve this end. Good heavens, they stick tracking devices in your shoulder, drill holes into your noggin and stick things there, talk you into practicing your killing techniques on your buddies, and worst of all, they make you eat those damn Cup-O-Noodles. All that sure seems like a lot of effort. Halliburton just used money, political shell-games, and plain old-fashioned voter ignorance when they did it. But godblessit, there's something that just appeals to me about watching a doctor take a Black & Decker to poor old Raymond Shaw's skull while he sits there, blissfully unaware of what's happening and smiling like he just found the Thorazine cookies. It reminds me a bit of the X-Files series, before they tied that show up into a huge knot.The rest of the film shows Marco trying to uncover the mystery without losing his own mind. He's already reading cheap paperback romance novels, so he'd better hurry. The acting in this picture is pretty good across the board, but Meryl Streep as the senatorial harpy/mom deserves special mention. You don't get to see her chew scenery often, but she does it here, in what would best be described as a riff on a certain former first lady named Clinton. Streep has gone on record as denying this connection, but come on - who is she kidding? This is clearly the Hilary we all like to believe exists when the cameras aren't rolling. The film has lots of tertiary information provided by sound bites and TV ticker scrawls. You may miss a few background things if you're not paying attention. There's also plenty of references to the silliness of today's politics. One image shows the presidential and VP candidate's faces tacked up on a doctored picture of Mt. Rushmore. Another scene has them dragging cops and firefighters out onto the stage with them. The targets here aren't so much the left or the right as much as the whole political process. That's another thing I liked about this movie. At least I'm not the only one wondering how the pundits can sit there on TV with straight faces and tell us how a VP candidate's main strength is the number of delegates he'll help carry on election day, like some late-season free agent acquisition in baseball - The guy who'll get you to the playoffs, but you don't want to build the franchise around him. As far as comparing Demme's Manchurian Candidate to the original, it lacks the eerie out-of-left-field wackiness from Frankenheimer's version. Like the garden party/brainwashing scene, or Janet Leigh calling herself a Chinese railworker. That kind of stuff kept you on your toes and made you wonder if you weren't hallucinating along with the characters. On the other hand, it also doesn't deflate itself with something like that hilariously awful fight scene in the original between Sinatra and Henry Silva. Sinatra's Kung-Fu was so bad, even Elvis laughed at it. Without his meds. There's also no Queen-of-Diamonds costume whopper that made you wonder just what the heck Frankenheimer was trying to pull. In other words, the remake is a little more consistent and a little less daring. Take that for what it's worth.Personally, I enjoyed the Demme version quite a bit. It stands up well along with the original, as it uses the basic storyline to address things relevant to our current situation and so avoids being the typical pointless Hollywood remake. A few minor plot holes keep it from being a great film, but it's a nice little venture into a sub-genre of movie that hasn't been getting any attention lately.",The Manchurian Candidate

His assistant director should have stood behind him with a riding crop to whip his flanks every time he let the pace drag so horribly or refused to make so many needed edits. Not even Ms. Streep can save this movie, which should give an idea of how flat it is. She doesn't have enough screen time to do so. It would be pointless to compare this with the original, they are so completely different, with the original shining brightly as a work of genius while this one should never have been released. I am not a fan of Sinatra movies (he was a great singer, a lousy actor), but he was acceptable in the original Manchurian Candidate. Here, Denzel Washington is simply painful to watch - not on his game as he is normally a fine actor. If you simply must watch it, skip it all until the last fifteen minutes, then congratulate yourself you didn't waste any more time than that on this dreadful waste of film stock.",The Manchurian Candidate
214,tjk1986,A less than spectacular remake with a greater than average cast,6,6 January 2005,"In a world of red alerts, yellow alerts, Fahrenheit 9/11, and a highly politicized corporate structure, a film with the content of The Manchurian Candidate should either snare its viewers with it crazy antics, or make them really ponder upon its ""could-be realistic"" thought process. This viewer did not fall into either category, but not for a lack of trying and not without giving ample credit to things I believed worked.An intricate story with an absorbing plot line should ensnare us the audience with a certain level of delicate script-work and careful direction, which in my mind, this film has neither. This story almost as if for no other reason than a phony set-up, begins with a quickly paced war sequence which ends all too abruptly and leaves us with confusion about characters, what we saw, and instead of a confusion where we want to know more, it leaves us non-caring and already irritated.Denzel Washington in an uncharacteristically subdued performance stars as a captain whose troops in 1991 Kuwait were on a mission scouting and were suddenly attacked. Jump forward in time to the present, where Denzel is visited by one of his troop (Jeffrey Wright, in a chilling and sympathetic performance) prodding him about his memories of this mission.Meanwhile, the underestimated Liev Schreiber plays another of Denzel's troop. Liev's character, miraculously led this troop to safety, fought solo, protected them, and was thus awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Now the son of a highly opinionated and powerful senator (Meryl Streep, in a spectacularly leveled performance up to the same caliber of Angela Lansbury's original) and despite his lack of passion and desire for the job, winds up on the vice presidential ticket.Denzel begins breaking down and thinks he remembers fragments of contrary stories through his dreams? What truly happened in Kuwait? And if something different than the record truly happened, then why does everyone believe the record? This would be enough plot but throw in corporate greed, judicial greed, a love story, a quasi-incestuous love story, changing stories, ridiculously tedious dreams, and we are left with one mess of a script.This remake fully utilizes great Hollywood talent of today, and in an ingenious way, makes the co-stars look better than the headliner. Worth renting for Meryl Streep, Liev Schreiber, and Jeffrey Wright's performances.6/10",The Manchurian Candidate

What is brainwashing you ask? It's making you believe something that you normally wouldn't through repetitive, subversive methods. Kinda like the people in Hollywood that keep inserting their political propaganda into our entertainment.Seriously, I know rich Hollywood types are self hating, but you really don't have to try and make us all just like you. We're good.The original was about Communist brainwashing which has been documented and exposed by Edward Hunter, Yuri Bezmenov and many others from the real world, although the clueless now would have you believe that that never happened...again...kinda sounds like brainwashing! Unfortunately, the idiots in the fantasy world of Hollywood seem to love Marxism so they can't very well say something negative about Communists. So who can the evil brainwashers be??? Surprise! It's a corporation! How original Hollywood.See the thing is that Communists like in North Korea, Cuba, old E. Germany and other Communist hot spots locked their citizens in. You know you have a great political theory when everyone wants to leave. :) Meanwhile, if a corporation doesn't make my burger right, I buy my burger elsewhere.I could go on and on and rip this movie and it's plot up, but the movie really isn't even worth the effort.

217,Arctic_fox,War politics spoiled with unbelievable science fiction,4,17 April 2005,"The film was an absolute failure. I haven't seen the original one, but I hope it's better than this film. The reason why I didn't like the film is that the plot was entirely unbelievable. The plot tries to tie a connection to a phenomenon known as the Gulf War Syndrome. A bunch of soldiers are brainwashed into believing that one of the soldiers saves the lives of the others on a mission during the Gulf War. Implants have been placed into the brains of the soldiers who were on that mission and they can be manipulated into e.g. killing people. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) is made a war hero.The film could have been believable, but the way in which the soldiers were supposed to be brainwashed is science fiction at its worst. The director could have used more subtle moves. He could have portrayed that Raymond Shaw was made to be a war hero in the same way that in the real life Jessica Lynch, a victim, was made a war hero. It could have also been said the soldiers were forced into playing along with the war hero thing. Frankly, I don't know why the critics say that the film is good.",The Manchurian Candidate

The story is slow and inconsistent and the directing is just plain heavy handed - focusing more on mood and music rather than story and plot. At one point about 15 minutes from the end credits all of the implications crystallize and the viewer can finally care - if they haven't given up completely.

227,samsan_lee,A Mirror of our times?,7,10 August 2005,"The odyssey of Jonathan Demme continues with another remake following The Truth about Charlie. The Manchurian Candidate remake trades the Cold War for the Kuwait Gulf War, and Major Ben Marco is played with tragic suffering by Denzel Washington. A preoccupied Liev Schrieber offers his troops a subdued portrait of Raymond Shaw. As usual Jeffrey Wright delivers a solid performance as Al Melvin, one of the mind controlled troops.Following a return from Kuwait, 13 years after, the patrol members begin to suffer from dreams. All may not be well, as Marco notices one of his members, Al Melvin warns him about dreams he's been having about the lost 3 days following an ambush in Kuwait. As the film moves on, I notice that the more disheveled Ben Marco becomes, the more aware of the conspiracy and the scope of it begins to become apparent. He looks as if he's on the fringes as he begins questioning the apparatus of the secret state and the,corporate totalitarianism that is ""Manchurian Global"".Demme adequately captures the paranoia and rampant patriotism of post 9/11. It seems as if it's a mirror of our current times, except in our world ""Manchurian Global"" is a sobering reality (insert Enron,Carlyle Group here)(minus the mind-controlled assassins, right?)The brainwashing scenario fades in and out seamlessly amid ""co-conspirators"" that appear briefly and seem to vanish. Meryl Streep emulated the original role of Eleanor Prentiss Shaw with vigor and gleeful accuracy. The near oedipal relationship between her and Raymond becoming evident as the film builds to an exciting end. Look for cameos by Roger Corman(a Demme mentor), Al Franken, and a nice role by Bruno Ganz. Denzel Washington gives us a broken, but courageous Ben Marco. A courageous soldier fighting against unbelievable odds to get his story across.The Manchurian Candidate succeeded where most remakes failed.

First, its characters... the movie sets up rules that govern the way the characters are supposed to behave, and then arbitrarily violates them.  It's hard to explain this without getting into specifics, but when you're dealing with ""brainwashing,"" and characters who can partially resist their brainwashing, i think you'd have to develop the characters enough so that you'd understand how they come to the points where they can or can't resist their programming.  Without that (or characters who're developed AT ALL), the only real reason anyone does anything in the second half of this movie is out of dramatic necessity (bad reason). The obvious reason for its popularity must be a superficially anti- corporate tone and lukewarm media commentary.  And don't get me wrong, I'm a raving lefty.  I hate the corporate vultures picking our political candidates a lot more than the next guy, probably.  But there's nothing really insightful or clever about The Manchurian Candidate's treatment of the media or the motives of corporate political influence... it's just set dressing.  And despite the solid performances and a lot of nice elements, it never comes together as a whole, in terms of resolving its characters' conflicts or in terms of developing any off its halfhearted social commentaries... so in the end, it meets its dramatic obligations by throwing a comforter over the bunched up mess of sheets and telling its parents that it made the bed.

229,larrymadill,"Very Good Remake, Possibility Better than the Original",8,19 February 2005,"I finally got to watch Jonathan Demme's re-make of 'The Manchurian Candidate"" I grabbed off Netflix, and as much as it makes me sound like heretic for saying it I think the 2004 re-make is better than the 1962 Frankenheimmer / Sinatra classic. Before you burner my Film-lover's membership card the 1962 version of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" is still one of the best movies from the Sixties. However, Demme just found a way to do it better in my mind.Mainly the plot and the style are both way ahead of the original. Demme's version looks and feels like a political version of ""Jacob's Ladder"". Trippy, paranoid, delusional, and almost alien. I guess that is the way the original felt back in 1962 . Now, however, Frankenheimmer's ""Manchurian Candidate"" feels campy. The stiff over the top, Studio System style of acting, the rigid slightly formulaic plotting, Henry Silva playing a Chinese Spy. And what exactly was Janet Leigh there for? Everything is deadly serious in Demme's version. (Perhaps almost too serious.) And the plot is more convoluted and yet makes a tad more sense. Gone are the artificial Hollywood conventions that sort of lorded over the original. The good guys can be crazy the bad guys are ambiguous. After a while you begin to question your own sanity.Not exactly flawless though. Ironically the title seems to be shoe-horned into the plot to an uncomfortable degree; would any multinational corporation really call themselves Manchuria Global? Why not Maosist Revolutionary Front, Inc.? Jon Voight's Senator Jordan has even less to do in this version, and Vera Farmiga's Jocelyn Jordan (hell at least make her dress up in a skimpy poker card outfit) has nothing to do. Liev Schrieber seems to be doing his best Laurence Harvey impersonation except in a couple of scenes were he seems to be acting across from Denzel.And a lot of the humor and cleverness of the original just got chipped away by the harsh blowing wind of modern reality. Gone is the Communist turned Lady's Garden party, gone is the 'How About a Game of Solitaire', gone is the red queens, gone is that hilarious costume party, and gone is Jodie just flagrantly bouncing around in a bikini like Gidget.But all in all Jonathan Demme's ""The Manchurian Candidate"" succeeds on nearly ever level, and brings a modern update to a classic.One of the best of 2004.",The Manchurian Candidate

232,wcpag7,Better than the original,10,25 November 2004,"One of the best remakes ever made because they took the original mindless red scare campy story of playing cards and focusing on the loopy Queen and made it more thought provoking, entirely creative and boundless. The story takes a detour from the original classic with implant technology, plot twists and a more credible involvement of an undercover FBI agent. The black and white original had more of a focus on Shaw and his love interest, shot dead with the poor cap guns and lounging on the beach after a deadly snake bite. The remake or should I say ""rework"" departs from this dead end role and intsted focuses on the Major's D. Washington's love interest with the woman on the train.Its a toss up to say that Merell or Angela played a better Senator, but there was one scene in the new movie which soars above the rest as she claws and fights for the nomination. Certainly they did a great job at casting Shaw this time around and he played the park with great respect of the original film. I'd say this is by far the best remake i've ever seen, and i'm generally against remakes. Like I said to fans of the original Battlestar Galactica, if you hated the remake.. watch it a few more times and forget about the original. And i'll say the same to those who can't get their eyes out of an old deck of cards.",The Manchurian Candidate
233,ZaWolven,Fine acting saves a dodgy script,7,22 December 2004,"Just how close this is to the original I couldn't say as I haven't seen the 1962 Frank Sinatra original, but as a stand alone political conspiracy thriller it definitely exceeded my expectations.The first thing that you notice about this film is the acting - superb from all participants. Denzel Washington gives a typically solid performance in the lead role and Liev Schrieber impresses as Raymond Shaw, but most credit must go to Meryl Streep for her highly chilling turn as the mother of a vice-presidential candidate. Her brilliantly psychotic performance is surely worthy of yet another Oscar nomination, and with good reason.But the acting has to be up to scratch as the script isn't. There are several moments in the film in which you really will have to suspend disbelief as the film climbs to new heights of implausibility, and the film's central premise - that an army unit has been brainwashed and that Raymond Shaw is being controlled by a global corporation - would surely not have got through the first production meeting had this been an original idea.But since when has a dodgy script stopped a film from being any good? If you're prepared to forget the real world for a couple of hours and forgive the weak ending, which suggests that the scriptwriters missed their deadline and were given an hour to think of an ending, you should find this an engrossing political thriller.7/10",The Manchurian Candidate
234,Kshalene,Bland-churian Candidate,5,4 April 2005,"If you have never seen the Sinatra version of this film, you will have a mediocre experience in this new version with Denzel Washington. The essential story is the same, albeit updated with the appropriate wars, misguided patriotism and politics suitable for the Bush 2 administration. If you have seen the Sinatra movie, do not bother, for this cultural road-bump is definitely not worth soiling the memories of the original classic. Streep is wonderful, of course, but not on screen enough. Denzel is asleep. And the rest of the cast is just okay. The cine-photography and editing are ordinary. Nothing to get excited about here, except for the hints at incest between Shaw and his mother, which, while oddly inappropriate and generally gross, does cast a new shadow on the characters, one that I found to be very interesting albeit a tad over-reaching. Yet this odd addition to the original script does not lift you out of the blasé monotony of the rest of the film.",The Manchurian Candidate
235,SandyZ7,Save Your Money and Rent the Original,1,13 November 2004,"After reading good reviews I was expecting something other than this totally awful movie. The dark menacing atmosphere of the 1962 film with Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury remainsone of the best political thrillers reinforced by superb acting and the use of black and white photography. The remake has lifeless muddled performances. Streep did not come across as believable and lacked the delightful viciousness portrayed by Lansbury. Washington provides a weak DeMarco versus one of Sinatra's best roles.The so-called plot is completely unbelievable - Did they think they were doing a ""Matrix"" or a ""Zombie"" Film? There are so many holes it looked like Swiss Cheese. Save your money and rent a DVD of the original.",The Manchurian Candidate
236,RamiNour101,was it supposed to a joke? Cause it wasn't funny!,4,10 April 2006,"'God Grief' was the first thought which ran through my head after this two hour Hollywood disaster finished, this movie is living proof, that most remakes always seize to fail miserably. If there was an award ceremony handing out awards for a movie which featured the most flaws, this film would swipe that award show clean. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" makes Britney Spears' 'crossroads' look like a intriguing classic.The cinematography is literally in your face, and it seems as though Tak Fujimoto has used up all his talent in 'the sixth sense' and 'the silence of the lambs'. Tak Fujimoto, seems to have glued his finger to the ""close up"" button for the entirety of the film, and with Denzel Washington's face covered up with more pimples than an 16 year old boys, it is not quite appealing to view. He has failed to capture, the little authenticity in this movie and because of his very poor effort, this movie becomes a greater disaster which should be remembered by the Razzie academy as the 'worst cinematography' is a film ever.The adaptation written by Richard Condom, is absurd and melodramatic, it makes Ruby's productions look sain and Shakespeare look naturalistic. Furthermore, the plot has so many wholes, one can hurt their ankles watching this film, no wonder it is rated MA15+, children do not deserve to hurt their precious limbs nor hurt their minds.There is not one scene where a naturalistic mannerism is pulled off in 'the Manchurian candidate', and when attempted to act them out by Denzel Washington, along with the rest of the cast (excluding Meryl Streep) make Ms. Dekota Fanning look like she out to take Mr. Washington's two Oscars, which the academy should demand back after this performance.This movie is a movie which is made for those, who would like to present themselves as apart of an intellectual audience whom have some sort of decent taste. Those who state this movie is there favorite movie of all time truly must reconsider. This film is made for those try hard democrats who wish to show they have some sort of knowledge of American politics. I laugh when I watch this movie, I cry and I get angry, because it is that bad. This film should be in a genre of it's own, the only thing holding this trashy cinema is Meryl Streeps- fantastic performance. How can one actress can be so fantastic in a film, which is surrounded with faults, and not spread onto her like a mad disease is stunning. Congrats Meryl.",The Manchurian Candidate
237,SnoopyvsRedBaron,Hollywood remakes-seems the trend continues... :-^,5,15 December 2006,"I do not like bringing politics into these movie discussions but seems some movies just beg for it to happen. One of those films is this remake of the 1962 movie, so if your politics are left of center, a believer of events in the Syriana movie, or hate anything that has Halliburton in it, then this is your movie.As its own and not seeing the original prior to watching this, the film is not bad. My only complaint is why keep the same title as the original movie? Yes the bad guys run a company called MANCHURIAN GLOBAL but these dunder heads that wrote this script seems not to know the real meaning for the word MANCHURIAN (hint:has to do with the country of China). Seems writers of today can not just come up with their own original ideas and have go and re-invent ones that have already been created. These ""remakes"" reminds me of the infamous sampling incident years ago with QUEEN/David BOWIE and VANILLA ICE from the song ""Under Pressure"". Just sample something of the original material and then add new or change the material/storyline and claim its an original all on its own. This movie has its thrills, and if you like conspiracies this is one to get your mouth wet. IF the maker of this movie would have just changed the title into something, I think this movie would have stood on its own. Again if you think Oliver Stone's JFK is ""actual history"", believe man has not landed on the moon, or believe alien technology is at work at Area 51, then you'll really get the tin foil hats to melt from watching this movie.",The Manchurian Candidate
238,juliojuarez10,Stop looking at the camera.,6,7 April 2016,"On the look out for a cerebral thriller, I came across this ten year old re-heat of the 1962 Frankenheimer film. Jonathan Demme is someone who you want to believe is a genius (Silence of the Lambs). Unfortunately watching this you can't help but feel that the screenplay for the afore mentioned must have laid things on a plate for him. Whilst there are some of his trademarks, notably the trade mark tight to camera eye-lines...there's nothing really here about the filmmaking that indicates any form of expression beyond just doing it by the numbers. Yes, there are a few tiny skin crawly moments (the tattoo face lady montage) where you think things might just get a bit Jacob's Ladder on you but the film never really hits any frights, down mostly due to its slavishly naturalistic aesthetic choices which is surprising given Demme was collaborating with very hot (at the time) DP Tak Fujimoto who shot dark classics including The Sixth Sense. Denzel is watchable as always and that's something worth the 5 dollars. It's probably also the best Liev Shrieber has been, perfectly cast as a golden boy political hopeful.

It cleverly incorporates current events in a way the original did not. Even if you've seen the original, the movie cleverly puts in a few new and significant twists that make it fresh and relevant.Some of the other comments suggested that this film didn't have a point. The plot is complicated, and it requires that you pay attention; which frankly a lot of folks simply aren't accustomed to in this era of Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters.What is the point of this movie? The point is that it actually makes you think; which is certainly a more meaningful point than some of the other summer movies.",The Manchurian Candidate

What does he think he can add to those great movies? There might be an answer to that question if he had chosen to ask it. With Manchurian Candidate, there was a great opportunity to draw parallels between the cold war and the war on terror by updating this masterpiece. Did he try to do this? Sort of. Did he succeed? Not really. This movie lacks the cleverness and heart of the first one, and it doesn't open my eyes to anything new. Save your ten buck, and rent the first one. Twice.",The Manchurian Candidate
241,sinuous,"Solid, Topical and Worthy of the Original",9,1 August 2004,"Manchurian Candidate is far closer to the original than you've probably heard, and even though it's not the exact movie, it hardly could have been. That the original is truly relevant would count little for modern audiences, who seem to have a hard time drawing parallels from anything out of their memory. One glimpse of black and white, and funky old clothes, and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty are out the door. Since they would only sit through a first run update, it's truly fine that they have one. The wonder is, the update stands up to the original. It even solves some of the problems of the first. Gone are the vaguely foreign looking actors standing in for Russians and Chinese agents. Gone are the poorly choreographed ju-jitsu moves. And the new film retains the strengths of the original. Every performance is fine. Liev Schrieber is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original gut kicking performance (though it's Harvey by an edge). Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work. (One of the wonders of the first is realizing that Sinatra -could- act, that he did things with rhythm and cadence because those were his only tools, and it worked. He was no method actor, but damn.) Streep's scenery chewing is frankly, perfect, because unfortunately, really disgusting people actually do exist, and the real ones are impervious to the critique that their behavior is over-the-top. Seen or heard any Fox commentators recently? Streep's Senator may be over-the-top, but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is - surprise - she's only acting.Make no mistake, both these films are paranoid thrillers, and the overly literal would say of either, ""preposterous"". But then, the overly literal don't usually get much out of anything that isn't underlined in Business Week with a magic marker. So if you fit in that category, go rent something less threatening.On the other hand, if you are the nervous type...The film's style is less dialog laden, it runs more on mood. But it really does kick in all the same places, the same incredible cynicism offset by the thinnest sliver of a wild, earnest Patriotism.",The Manchurian Candidate

I found many of the scenes greatly shocking, which was certainly a directing success, and the way the story unfolds kept a constant chill running up my spine from one moment to the next.I know that the movie succeeded in winning an audience through, and its dense and twisting plot will certainly leave one pondering on how the whole situation evolved, without leaving any serious gaps during the movie.Very thought-provoking, but also very good, and not over-complex to the point where you have to watch it two or three times to realize what happened.So, I found direction and script flawless.Although I did not expect any great acting highlights, the actors added into the overall realistic feel of the film, with very good performance for all three major roles.Overall, a perfect film in its own genre that I couldn't detect any serious flaws.8/10 because the introduction could've been better IMO, and some scenes from the brainwash imagery, were unnecessary, and could not be explained.",The Manchurian Candidate

But the biggest howler has to be election day, where a pivotal scene takes place in an elementary school. With students. Hello, it's ELECTION DAY. Schools are closed. To me this is a fire-able offense. And then there is the awful soundtrack, the silliness of the plot- how does Denzel get constant access to a VP candidate anyway who is always in NY or DC, and tacky direction. Kimberly Elise is a disaster, all scowls and Denzel just tries to hard. Streep should've chewed more scenery. And how is she in the same political party as her son & his running mate since she's basically a right-wing Republican while they are bleeding heart Dems? Besides the election day howler, there's this: the election apparently takes place days after the convention, not months as it does in real life.

Liev Schreiber finally got a long overdue opportunity to show what he can do in a leading role and he really shines. There is no doubt in my mind that he will be nominated for all the major awards and likely win Best Supporting Actor as he was so convincing. As for Denzel he did a standup, convincing job that we have come to expect of this great actor.

I was shaken by the unexpected turns of the plot and by the masterful performances of everyone involved. I will never look at Meryl Streep in the same way again! She was fantastic!

Unfortunately, the user rating on IMDb for this film seems to be plagued with fans of the original film that hated this film before they saw it (and die-hard Bush supporters). This film had received well deserved critical acclaim - its not hard to see why. Jonathan Demme has updated the original 1962 classic with such intelligence and creativity that it basically is as good if not better than the original. The entire cast is wonderful and Liev Schreiber does a surprisingly good job...Meryl Streep...ah, dear Meryl...this film just proves that she is THE BEST actress on the planet. She gives an absolutely terrifying performance as Elenor Shaw (watch out for the immensely disturbing bathroom scene with Schreiber). This film is an absolute masterpiece, which, in my opinion, is a lot better the the original 1962 film.

Demme is the one who is responsible for this atrocity that defecates upon the original masterpiece.Other than Meryl Streep's spot on personification of Hilary Clinton there is no reason to watch this. What will really anger you if you are aware of what's going on is how Demme lets you know that he is aware as well, but unlike Oliver Stone before he became a dope smoking dilettante, Jonathan Demme has no balls.Oh if you are sharp eyed and think about this movie later after watching it you will notice that the altered surveillance footage of the assassin Marco resembles the surveillance footage released of Mohamed Atta, but Demme makes no effort to punch this through to the mind of the viewer the way Stone made his points in ""JFK"". Demme doesn't do his job here because he doesn't want to deal with the heat which would have come from doing so.Gutless.Kimberley Elise plays a character which should have been an intriguing personification of Condoleezza Rice, but ultimately will leave most viewers confused. Indeed, the end of the movie does not seem clear at all. I think that Elise's character is working for the Manchurian Corporation and they hit the Shaws because Streep's character is out of control and thus threatening to them. Thus Denzel's Marco character is still under the corporation's control at the movies end.But will most people view it that way? I think not, and that is Demme's fault.The original film made the dramatic point that it was quite likely that Raymond Shaw's step father (absent from this production) -who was based upon Joe McCarthy- could very well have been what he was so loudly claiming to fight. That is indeed what we are dealing with in the Bush administration which is populated by Trotskyites (Perle Wolfowitz, Feith etc.) who are willing to destroy America in defense of the terroristic state of Israel (never mentioned in this movie).Watch the original again as it is more relevant to what is going on today then this patchwork bit of tripe, and more historically relevant in the likely hypnotically programmed assassins of Robert F. Kennedy and George Wallace, who came along many years after the film was made and then removed from circulation before Sirhan Sirhan and Arthur Bremer could perform in public for their hypnotist masters.",The Manchurian Candidate

I had seen both in other movies and as of always, they followed through, proving their superior acting with each second of the show. I was intrigued with the plot of the show and impressed with how it kept you wondering what was going to happen next. As I was watching the movie I was thinking to myself ""I don't think it's physically possible to ruin this show within the last twenty minutes of the show."" To my unfortunate surprise I spoke too soon. Everything came to a crashing halt when Raymond Shaw failed to step on the red star and that's when I knew that it was all going to end wrong. My brain was screaming out warning signals. ""He's going to die!!!!"" But instead I ignored what my brain was thinking and continued watching in denial thinking to myself ""It's going to be like all movies, where they have the dramatic scene where the main character snaps out of it and stops doing what he's about to do. Quit worrying."" Obviously I was wrong. No sooner had I thought this and Raymond was shot and killed. For me that was the reason I rated this show one star. Simply brilliant through and through, but when it came down to it, they massacred the ending and brought all brilliance to a dead (quite literally) stop. If you're a guy, this probably won't affect you(I say probably because there might be some guy who doesn't like it).

The film followed the original decently, except that it was moved from Korea to the Gulf War. Liev Schreiber, who plays Raymond Shaw, formerly played by Laurence Harvey, is running for vice president, while in the first one, Raymond Shaw's stepfather is running for the position. Meryl Streep did impressively portray Angela Lansbury's maniacally motherly way as Schreiber's conniving mother. Denzel Washington impressively played Major Ben Marco, but not to the avail that was portrayed on-screen by Frank Sinatra. But you really can not compare the two, for the difference in character was separated by the difference in time and setting of the films. Kimberley Elise, who played opposite Washington in John Q, meshed well with this cast that includes Jon Voight as Senator Jordan and Vera Farmiga who plays Shaw's love interest. Elise's part in the film was much larger then her forerunner's, played by Janet Leigh.

The movie was trite, utterly predictable, not a bit suspenseful (tell me you didn't know that Meryl Streep was evil from about one minute into the movie and that her son was nothing but an automaton).But worse than this, the movie made no sense at all. For one thing, why would a conservative senator work so hard to put her liberal son in the White House? And why would she plot to do so by staging a fake rescue years before he had any political career (as we all know heroes don't necessarily become presidents - in fact, part time reservists and draft evaders have a lot better track record these days)? And if you could brainwash the entire squad, what's the point of murdering any of them? And if you have to murder some of them, why have your son do it? And if you go through all of this, why set him up for the vice-presidency? Why not the #1 post? And who did they plan to have shoot the president if Denzel hadn't shown up? And when Jon Voigt got wise to the scheme, why send your son, the president-to-be to off them rather than some other henchman (Denzel would have made a good choice there, wouldn't he)? And did that FBI chick really have a crisis of conscience before saying ""I believe you, Denzel (or whatever his name was)? And, as my 19 year old son pointed out, even if they could brainwash the good, honest, and true blue Denzel to assassinate the president, once he shook off the spell (how did he do that, anyway?), why wouldn't he have just dropped the gun and exposed Meryl and her son instead of killing them instead? Is that how he acts when he regains free will? And finally, what was with that would be erotic sequence when mom is drying junior off? I mean, really, this is moronic. And it gets an average rating of 6.7? Maybe that is the real message of this political horror/nightmare script -- if a big studio hires big name actors and budgets a lot of money for advertising, not only will the American public go to see the movie, they'll actually like it, no matter how bad it really is! Maybe it is a parable of the 2004 election after all.",The Manchurian Candidate
262,info-3657,"Nice seen the original, but this one is just another great movie of Denzel",8,14 December 2004,"Again on short time a movie where Denzel takes control. I never saw the original, so i cant judge if it is better or not....but this one is going to be another masterpiece to the collection of mister Washington. During the movie the plot gets clear very soon, Meryl Streep is playing the loving but not caring senator-mother of a Medal of Honor-soldier, fighting to win the campaign for vice president of the United States once back from the Gulf War. No soldier of the same squad that came back from Desert Storm remembers exactly what happened over there and why Shaw got the medal, but Denzel is dying to find out and of course he will. Good entertaining film that has to be seen if you like Denzel Washington. Maybe bit more action scenes from Gulf War had to be in there, but not a minus because of that.",The Manchurian Candidate
263,sunkilmoontipton,This movie is a candidate for the trash bin.,3,3 April 2005,"This movie is another classic example of what is wrong with so many Hollywood movies lately. They are all about flash and forget the substance. I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film (delayed release because of the Robert Kennedy assignation). I wanted badly to like it but the new, updated plot had more holes in it than I could excuse.Don't get me wrong, I am not one of those movie viewers who demands absolute reality. I am willing to suspend my belief when the movie starts, but this one simply has too many gaps or weaknesses in its plot to allow anyone to do so. I mean, a vice-presidential candidate's hotel room with a fake closet and a brain surgery operating room on the other side to implant miniaturized computer chips commanded by his mother! Who okay-ed that little bit of silliness? I felt sorry for the cast, including Meryl Streep, who tried their best to rescue this film but in the end it deserves to be lost and forgotten.",The Manchurian Candidate

I thoroughly enjoyed the original masterpiece, but found this 'up-dated' version sadly disappointing. It desperately tries to tell a story of intrigue & deception, but the nefarious foe, this time ""Manchurion Global"" is only misunderstood at best. Although the premise is the same, the plot deviates too far from the original story, which had far more serious implications. The only bright spots are Meryl Streep's fine performance, which ranks along with Angela Landsbury's sinister portrayal of the protagonist's mother, & Denzel Washington's solid job as Major Marco, though lost in an utterly hopeless script. Serves as a bad example of re-make marketing.",The Manchurian Candidate

266,schj98,A truly terrible film.,1,4 August 2004,While somewhat interesting in parts the plot of this film is all over the place and rather full of holes. I was sad to see this movie that had great potential was done so poorly. At the showing I attended at least 10 people out of the 20 or so that were in attendance got up and left and to be honest I just about got up and left myself. In short don't waste your hard earned money on this film it simply wasn't worth seeing. At least not at the price movie tickets cost these days. If you are a die-hard fan of Denzel Washington then you might enjoy renting it but if not don't waste your time. Just my.02 cents for you.* out of **** stars a dismal attempt at film-making.,The Manchurian Candidate
267,Thrilla_night,Disappointing...considering the cast and director,6,13 January 2005,"This was on my ""must-see"" list because I love the work of Jonathan Demme, Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep. I loved the original 1962 movie. This new version wasn't awful, and I understand what the movie was trying to do...but it left a lot to be desired in the end. Although it was not boring, it didn't have the excitement, the edge-of-your-seat suspense that the original '62 picture had. And Denzel Washington is always good, his acting is always above the material he is given. Meryl Streep was OK. I mean she is always an excellent actress, but I guess I had a problem with her doing this role because Angela Lansbury was so awesome in the original film. I personally think Meryl could have done more...just an opinion. Also, I was kind of nit-picky about plot elements and some characters, particularly the relationship between Denzel's and Kimberly Elise's characters. Maybe it is the way it was written into the screenplay and the way it was executed. It just didn't work for me, it was either too far-fetched or over-the-top (for instance the scene when she persistently asks him if he is all right while he is in the bathroom was kind of overdone) Anyway, I could go on, but that would make this too long...but I'd like to add that I might have enjoyed this better if I hadn't seen the 1962 version. This one really pales in comparison. I would like to see a moratorium on remakes of movie classics. I doubt that will happen, but it would be nice to see original movies that were made in their own time stand on their own. Most remakes are entirely unnecessary. I hate to say that this is one of those cases.",The Manchurian Candidate

This movie keeps you thinking every step of the way,trying to figure out who did what and why. I kept pausing the movie and solving everything that was going on. Its a very entertaining movie. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat,especially at the end scene with the sniper rifle(I wont say anything more). I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good mystery. The only thing i wished they would have done was get those dirty bastards at Manchurian Global. I also felt like something was missing at the end, it just needed something else to make it complete. In the end it was a very good movie.",The Manchurian Candidate
269,teresaleej,A brilliant update of a brilliant movie,10,1 August 2004,"Set against the Cold War and our fear of Communist infiltration, the original Manchurian Candidate(1963) revealed a significant universal theme: the misuse of power through the exploitation of paranoia and allegiance. The same theme, unfortunately, rings just as true today. Yes, the Berlin Wall has crumbled, but now we are a nation frozen with the fear of terrorist infiltration, vulnerable to the misuse of corporate and governmental powers.The writers made believable, relevant changes to every aspect of the original story that would seem dated today, including the role of women. Rather than Janet Leigh's thankless role of arbitrary girlfriend, her counterpart in this movie is an FBI agent, as strong and significant as any of the men in the film. In the original, Raymond's mother (Angela Lansbury) worked through her husband, (how else could a woman have access to power in 1963?) Meryl Streep's Mother Shaw doesn't need to work through her man; she has direct power as a vicious, Machiavelian senator. Viewers who remember the original may pine for the chill they felt watching Lansbury's portrayal; the concept of a woman who seeks and controls power is just not shocking today. However, Streep is amazing, and I guarantee one scene between her and Shaw will raise the hairs on the back of your neck.Mind control is made more relevant in the newer version as it is linked to ""bad science,"" a current fear in an age of cloning, and genetic engineering.However, the movie is still a psychological thriller and the manipulation of good men through fear and misplaced allegiance (especially to dear old mom) is as chilling as in the original.Both movies are a cry to each of us to take control of our lives, our decisions, our futures. The hero as independent thinker runs true in both movies, spelled out in no uncertain terms in Marco (Denzel Washington's) last inner monologue about the Congressional Medal of Honor. The audience realizes as does Marco, the legitimacy of the medal in question, and exactly what it means to be a hero.",The Manchurian Candidate
270,aerdensrw,Remake is inferior to the original film. (spoilers),2,7 August 2004,"When I first saw The Manchurian Candidate 15 years ago, I cried for a good half-hour afterward. The 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate completely lacks the stunning emotional impact of the original film. Lawrence Harvey brought to the original film an anger, passion, and desperation that Liev Schreiber does not deliver. Schreiber's version of Raymond Shaw has given in to his mother, with only token moments of rebellion. He looks to Denzel Washington's Maj. Marco to get him out of the situation, whereas Harvey's Shaw takes matters into his own hands.Senator Eleanor Prentiss-Shaw, played by Meryl Streep, carries the remake. She is everything Angela Lansbury was, and more. My only quibble is that she is so obnoxious, albeit charismatic, that I don't understand why everyone fawns all over her.The major flaw of this film is the almost total excision of the Josie plot. Raymond's love for Josie and his happiness with her is what allows viewers of the original film to make a deep emotional connection with Shaw, which is what makes the original ending so very powerful and tragic. The emotional impact simply is not there in the remake, and the remake suffers for its lack.I also believe the remake suffers from the shifting of protagonist from Shaw to Marco. Marco is Everyman, a good pair of eyes through which to see events unfold. But the power of this story has to come from Shaw. This story succeeds best when the audience can come to love a man who is 'impossible to like.'Two stars. Go rent the original film, not this remake.",The Manchurian Candidate
271,arthur-imdb,Weak Remake w/ Extra Strength Propaganda,2,24 December 2004,"Like so many remakes this ""hack"" director can't seem to keep true to the original story. If your going to almost totally rewrite the story don't remake the film, make your own or at the very minimum don't steal the title of a classic.As for the merits of the movie as an original offering, in a word weak. There was a no real suspense... Plot holes, incompetent characters and ineffective attempts to steer the viewer away from figuring out the ending. But on the plus side I thought the acting was very good.I am not sure what the message of movie was... It changed drastically and was incoherent. To even explore this would take thousands of words, so I will not..There is one particularly creepy scene with Meryl Streep that seemed to have been edited short. It would have made me much happier if they would have shaved a few more seconds off.You will be hard pressed to find more than a few minutes of propaganda free film. I can understand if it helps the story but it does not. I am not sure if the director even believes the movie going public will notice it. It was blatant, but I felt like the arrogant director thought he could pull a fast one on me. It was like seeing the product placements for Pepsi on an episode of Friends. Am I supposed to be too stupid to notice or should I just allow myself to be subliminally influenced? This movie was not Catwoman so I had to give it at least a 2!!!",The Manchurian Candidate
272,danzwales,A Thinkers Film,7,29 November 2004,"I talked about 6 of my friends into seeing this film...they gave me grief while i smiled on. I liked it! I think Denzel Washington is brilliant and i can't think of one of his films that I've disliked.-Back to the film.- I enjoyed it. I thought the storyline was different from recent films which made it appeal to me. The idea of soldiers from the Gulf being kidnapped and experimented on then released and everything covered up. During the film you learn what happened to them a bit at a time which kept you guessing, giving you clues then leaving it for a while, brill!However, i didn't give it 10, and thats for a reason. The storyline was intelligent and interesting but did lack excitement at times. I felt that some bits were quiet, not enough happening and just a bit boring to be honest. I think thats where my friends lost interest and where i tried to keep with it. Also the end was a little confusing, i didn't fully understand if the ""bad guys"" were caught/brought to justice etc.If you were to see this i would recommend you be into thinking films and not all action. And don't bring someone who will get bored and distract you through it as you will miss things!!

273,jmcgrellis,Why?,5,21 October 2005,"I'll be brief here. The 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate is, in my opinion, an absolute travesty. While I am generally antipathetic toward ""remakes"", I am offended by this one. To take a classic like the 1962 version with Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, and Angela Lansbury and ""update"" it with equally talented actors like Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep should be regarded as the artistic equivalent of capital crime.Let me be clear about one thing. Washington, Schreiber and Streep (a cast to kill for) are just fine in this movie. What upsets me so much is that these three (not to mention the rest of the very talented cast of the 2004 film) are absolutely wasted in this ill-conceived project.All of the intricacies of the original version have been ""dumbed down"" and ""teched-up"" in this ""remake"". The really clever conceit of the Queen of Diamonds and, especially, the ladies gardening club of the original are nowhere to be found. The ironies of the cold war implications of the original were, apparently, regarded as irrelevant for our times.Notwithstanding the above, if you must view the 2004 version, I will say that, on its own, it is a mildly passable diversion - worth watching only for its first-rate cast.However, if you have never seen the original, I earnestly recommend that you run (not walk) to the nearest video store and rent or buy the original ASAP. You'll thank me later.",The Manchurian Candidate

The original one was not that great; it was ALRIGHT for ITS TIME; but thats about it. Just because a movie came out 40 years ago doesn't make it a classic. This film had an interesting plot that kept me watching and was very suspenseful. Everything was great from the acting to the direction or from the cinematography to the score. From Jonathan Demme, the same man who brought you The Silence of the Lambs. Enough said. An overall excellent movie.",The Manchurian Candidate
276,sr_tiago,Manchurian,7,1 March 2005,"This movie was decent, and this is coming from a very hard movie critic. These days, it's hard to come up with something new. There were a lot of things about this movie that were predictable, but then there were some things that were surprising, even chilling. Even though some aspects of the film were obviously far-fetched, the effective element in this movie is that in the back of the viewers mind, they know there's a good possibility that something like this could indeed happen in real life. Brainwashing soldiers with miniature implants - very possible in today's heavily technological age.I loved the acting in this movie. Liev Schreiber was more than convincing in his role, and I was very surprised at how well he played his part. The images of torture and brainwashing were strikingly real, but overall, the movie could have been a lot better if some of the screws had been tightened up a little better. I mean, hey, they did one thing right by casting some great actors and actresses. Jon Voight, Denzel Washington, and Meryl Streep - what a great combo. But to think a high tech brainwashing lab could be concealed in the closest of a junior Senator's hotel suite (with a complete set of mad scientists included) is ridiculous. Even more odd is the scene in which Schreiber's character kills Voight's character. The whole thing was like something out of the twilight zone. I mean Raymond (Schreiber) just walks through the water like Moses, only in a fine tailored suit and trench coat, and drowns another Senator in broad daylight? Come on  Jordan (Voight) just paddles his little kayak right into the trap. I would think it very odd if a man came to my house, that I just threatened, and starts walking towards my little canoe for no good reason in the world. And why didn't his daughter just call the police? Honestly, I didn't know if I was dreaming or Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) was. I kept waiting for somebody, me, him, to wake up. And what's with the brazen speech by Eleanor Shaw (Streep) that turns the Vice President nomination around in an instant? I didn't know politics could be so exciting.

278,wigwam86,"Good, but not good enough to carry its title.",7,6 August 2004,"This remake, standing alone, deserves to be considered an above average movie. It is gripping, exciting, and (at times) smart. However, it shames the title it bears. Not only has the plot been manipulated (albeit the general plot of the movie still holds to its 1962 counterpart) but the significance of each character has too. While Capt. Bennett Marco was significant in the original version, he now is more significant than Raymond Shaw (the protagonist of the original). Furthermore, the creators decided to muck up the movie by using mind control devices instead of just brainwashing. Not only was it unnecessary to add the extra change, but it made the movie more far-fetched than needed. It would have been so much easier to just have said, ""The soldiers were brainwashed"" than going through the technical mumbo-jumbo that the 2004 version decided to add. In my opinion, the only aspect they nailed dead-on from the first one was Meryl Streep's performance as she lived up to the performance of Angela Lansbury Basically, they went and messed with a perfectly good plot (possibly one of the best plots ever created) for no good reason (obviously they had to remove the communist aspect and the war, but other changes were excessive). Despite my complaints, I'd still consider the movie worth watching.

I saw the original Manchurian Candidate this past spring in a film class, and thought the whole premise was rather far-fetched. I was hoping the new version offered a little more in the reality department -- it doesn't. With terrorism being one of our biggest fear these days, the premise of a mother turning her son over to someone to reprogam his mind, just so he can become president, seems a tad bit ridiculous. Maybe, if the army unit had been taken hostage by a group of terrorists and their minds reprogrammed -- it might have made a better movie.",The Manchurian Candidate
280,liveabovehell,Two Films - Two Eras,8,20 April 2005,"I think a lot of emphasis has been placed on the roles of Meryl Streep and Angela Lansbury in both versions of Condon's 'The Manchurian Candidate', but I think ultimately this is only detrimental to both versions. What Angela Lansbury does, in her own right, in the 1962 version stands alone, along with the piece itself. This is also true of Streep's interpretation of 'Mother' in the 2004 version. Director Jonathan Demme has noticeably updated the newer piece in accordance to a newer era and, clearly, if compared with the original, this will seem to cause friction. However, I think the new film ultimately deserves to be considered in its own light. This film will scare you, it will surprise you and, fundamentally, it will make you think. Unlike many other films with similar specification, the cast of Demme's 'The Manchurian Candidate' quite literally does speak volumes about the power and quality of the film itself - Meryl Streep, Jon Voight, Denzel Washington and Liev Schreiber all provide emotional and accurate performances which tenaciously hit home with all viewers and strike chords that, once provoked, will resonate long after the credits have risen.Whether you've seen the original or not, and providing you can modernise with the plot, 'The Manchurian Candidate' is a must see.",The Manchurian Candidate
281,wshuber,Answer to a Question Nobody Asked,2,28 May 2012,"There is nothing worse in Hollywood than a remake which was created in spite of the fact that the world has changed since the original and there's no longer any need or justification for the plot at all. They absolutely would have been better off just setting this movie in the early 60's and remaking the original that way. Or, better yet, they could have abstained from making a second Manchurian Candidate at all. The premise of this movie is so pathetic it doesn't even rise to the level of laughable. Let me explain, and this part contains lots of spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading now. In this movie, the title character was kidnapped from a war zone during the Gulf War in 1991 and brainwashed by a corporation so he could go home an eventually become President, and then, and here's the really sinister part, he could serve as a tool of this corporation as President. Let me say that again, some company hatched a nefarious scheme to make the person in the Oval Office do their bidding. Now maybe I'm going crazy here, but couldn't they have saved themselves a ton of time and money and just supported a Republican getting elected President?! Republicans suck up to all major corporations, whether they're making profits or begging for a billion dollar bailout, whether they are undertaking a green imitative or spilling a million barrels of oil into the gulf. If you want a brainwashed corporate tool, just get Republican elected. So the plot of this movie is completely kaput. And btw, it was really stupid and transparent the way the filmmakers thought if they made Meryl Streep's character a right-winger, but then just tried like hell to make her look exactly like Hilary Clinton, that everybody would see it as fair and balanced or something. The original Manchurian Candidate was an amazing classic. Go see it, and don't waste your time with this completely needless and pathetic remake.

My only complaints were that some of the facial closeups were a little TOO upclose! I'm recommending all my friends see this movie. This is one that in a country already encased by fear, the U.S. will become even more paranoid. The story is that our hero, Major Ben Marco (played by Denzel) starts to realize that what he remembers of 3 missing days in Kuwait back in 1991 may not be the truth and Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev), his former Sgt. is now running for the Vice President of the United States.

Throughout all of this I felt that there would be some surprising twist ending where Dorothy finds herself not in Oz, but such is not the case with this movie.All the convolution is real.

Shame on the director and cinematographer for this OFFENSIVE and clichéd contrivance - presumably to draw the viewer into tortured mental-scape theme. If you haven't left in the first fifteen minutes (I walked out, but my son retrieved me), the rest of the film is fair, although direction and cinematography remain aggravating in the extreme. Meryl is marvelously evil and I love almost everything Denzel does. Story is good enough to survive (but just barely) the directorial butchery. The release is moderately entertaining overall.

286,CosmicMessenger,"Pretty good job, for a remake",8,1 August 2004,"They did a pretty good job of this. They changed the plot a bit from the original but they kept to the same story line. They added to the ending a little, where I felt the original left you hanging. All in all, they didn't destroy the original concept which is a good thing in this case. One thing to note, for those who haven't seen it: they go quite a bit further with the violence in this movie (compared to the original), leaving nothing inferred.The graphic portrayal of the mind-controlled murders was shocking and sickening in a very realistic way, which was no doubt intended. It served to successfully grasp the audience's attention. I don't think that there has been a film showing with such realism the effects of a bullet when shot into a man's head, nor forced the audience to watch with grueling and realistic brutality the choking of another man's life. The only other possible downside to the movie is for the attention deficit: there are at least two scenes where the dialog is the main focus and it stays that way for several minutes. It serves quite adequately to orient us with the characters, and it is not boring enough to keep either the seasoned critic or the action-junkie viewers from continuing to watch this excellent film. In my opinion, this is another success for Denzel Washington.",The Manchurian Candidate

If nothing else, it's worth seeing for Meryl Streep's wonderful performance.If you have seen the original, wait until this one comes out on DVD. Somewhere along the line, Demme (director) decided to short cut so many scenes, that the film lost its flow. It also lacked the genuine terror of the original. What terror it did evoke should have been done in a more subtle way. Frank Sinatra (Denzel Washington's role) was much more believable in his portrayal, as was Laurence Harvey.

Jonathan Demme and company have managed to erase every ounce of suspense from the story, and give away way too much, way too soon. More than that, the creators of this film have obviously bought into the standard Hollywood political stance that big business is inherently evil. (Have they looked in the mirror lately?) Rather than update the script with a more modern and believable enemy than communism, they would have the audience buy into a story where a global defense logistics corporation (read: Halliburton) has an easier time capturing and brainwashing soldiers and running them for office than they would say, oh... buying political favor from the Beltway Blowhards. John Frankenheimer's tense and sweaty classic had so much more going for it, AND it has a plausible plot.

289,richard_dowell,The Illuminati Candidate.,6,8 January 2005,"I enjoyed this modernization of the 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate which was from a Richard Condon book of the same name though I was a bit frustrated. This version was very well thought out and technically brilliant with fine performances and fun sequences like the first time Raymond Shaw is called in for a check up. The main character played by Denzel Washington was well paced as he slowly progressed into uncontrollability except when wearing his Army uniform as the story called for it. There were a handful of differences from the 1962 version in order to not step on the toes of the original to give originality as well as surprise techniques to those who have seen the original such as the major differences of the characters of Rosie (Kimberly Elise) and Jocelyne (Vera Farmiga) from the 1962 version of the incredibly beautiful Janet Leigh (Eugenie Rose) and the lovely Leslie Parrish (Jocelyn). (Notice even an inconsequential spelling difference and even pronunciation differences to both names.) Sadly there was also a missed opportunity to cash in on real life by not sticking to the real puppet masters  the Chinese or Korean or Russian Communists which could easily have been done since the real life Eleanor Shaw (Meryl Streep)  Hillary Rodham Clinton  has had an ongoing relationship with the Chinese since the late 1970's when Bill Clinton first became Arkansas Governor. One item that was conspicuously changed from this remake was that the trigger code for Liev Schreiber's character (Raymond Shaw) was not only simplified  one phone call instead of two - but didn't have the strong maternal implication - the queen of diamonds. This was actually fine because the movie could now be more focused on the modernization of the brainwashing which was more technical and more sinister. Both versions also only hinted at an incestuous relationship that was crystal clear in the book. The Raymond Shaw character was much more of an assassin in the book and in fact his mother was out of control as she used him as her personal weapon. Instead this updated version had something possibly even more powerful - a real live art imitates life evil, power-hungry Senator. In real life the Senator from New York may not have assassins (though many conspiracy theorists believe she does.) at her beck and call she does and did indeed use the IRS, the FBI and the CIA as her weapons of choice on her enemies. According to a person who was very close to her  Dick Morris  she is a paranoid just as the movie portrays her. It was obvious that Charles Foster Kane (Citizen Kane) was William Randolph Hearst and now Eleanor Shaw was without question Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sadly even though Meryl Streep denied it she had the same hair style and color, mannerisms, voice and job as Senator Clinton and was every bit as aggressive, power-hungry and as evil as Senator Clinton's detractors believe. The two scenes of Eleanor Shaw with first the committee to decide the Vice Presidential candidate and then the clandestine meeting with the Manchurian Global executives displayed her aggression quite clearly. The sad thing is that even though it was obvious that it was to mirror Senator Clinton who was indeed the Manchurian Candidate in 1996 along with her husband by taking $65M from the Red Chinese in exchange for missile making secrets, hardware and computers Jonathan Demme decided to ignore that and create a fictitious company called Manchurian Global. This was similar to the movie The Sum of All Fears changing the villain from Islamofascists as Tom Clancy had correctly predicted to the Russians. It's obviously okay to offend the Russians but not Islamofascists. This villainous company could have easily been called Umptyscratch Global for all it meant though many liberals will insert Halliburton. But The Umptyscratch Candidate would sound silly I guess. So they put in some catch phrases that pointed to the Illuminati or the Bilderbergs or the Tri Lateral Group or The Council on Foreign Relations or Skull and Bones that include the highest ranking leaders in the world. This was actually a fairly interesting conspiracy theory because except for Ronald Reagan all of the United States Presidents since 1976 have been in the Tri Lateral Group and even in 1981 President Ronald Reagan was almost assassinated and if the assassination was successful a Tri Lateral would have been President much earlier than 1988. Even if John Kerry had won in 2004 it would have been an unbroken chain because like both Presidents Bush Senator Kerry is also a Skull and Bonesman! Liev Schreiber was boring compared to Lawrence Harvey. Denzel Washington was entertaining though not in the same class with Frank Sinatra's performance (superb karate fight with Henry Silva), however it is interesting to see the world's greatest actress - Meryl Streep - make you believe that she is the world's most dangerous woman though still not as sinister as Angela Lansbury's 1962 performance.rd.""Well that's what you get for attacking the President"". --I.R.S. auditor to Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch when he was illegally audited.(Hillary Clinton is the) ""most dangerous woman in America"". --Bill O'Reilly who has been illegally audited three times via the Clintons.""I can tell you that the decisions we (along with Hillary) made, we made them because we thought they were in the interests of the American people.""--BillClinton in 1998, on BEING ASKED WHY HE SIGNED WAIVERS, AGAINST THE PENTAGON'S PROTEST, TO SELL LORAL MISSILE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNIST CHINA, ENABLING CHINA FOR THE FIRST TIME TO LAUNCH THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH ENHANCED PRECISION.""Well they would've gotten it anyway."" --Hillary Clinton flippantly said knowing she was immune to any prosecution ever when confronted about selling missile making secrets, missile making hardware and computers for fire control for missiles to the red Chinese for $65M for her reelection campaign in 1996.",The Manchurian Candidate

292,scottydownes,Highly disappointing,1,2 December 2004,"When I saw The Manchurian Candidate with my AS Level film studies class, I was one of many students who left the cinema feeling generally dissatisfied with what i had spent the last 2 and a half hours watching.There a couple of things I can say impressed me some what in the film.Firstly, the performance of the actors, especially Meryl Streep. I enjoyed the way that her performance as a strong female in politics went against the norm of a male dominated society. Secondly the soundtrack to the film i thought accompanied what was going on on screen very effectively and helped add excitement to what we see.I must say that until i saw The Manchurian Candidate i had never been bored in a cinema but it was the lack of depth to the characters, the very slow release of information (especially in the first 20 minutes where there is little to none) and the somewhat obvious ending. Had I been watching this film at home, i do not think i would have endured it all.Having not seen the original I must say i would be interested to see how it has been changed in the remake and see where the remake has gone wrong. I would hope for more subtlety in the revelation of information and facts. Also i would hope to see far more exploration in the characters past and see relationships between them built upon them a great deal more.I personally feel that had more time been spent on plot development and the character relationships the film would have been more interesting and consequently more enjoyable. My final criticism would be the length of it. Had 30 - 40 minutes been cut out of the film, the story would be pacier and more captivating.",The Manchurian Candidate
293,jerome1382,Good movie!!! Even loved the ending,8,27 December 2004,This movie has some of the best actors in the world today. They give great performances and make the movie believable. Denzel does his thing in this movie. Not his best but still enjoyable to watch. Most people take this movie to serious. Just enjoy it for what it is. I loved it!! Many reviewers complain about the ending. They say it is not very clear. Does Denzel's character die in the end?Is the last scene is just a dream? I think Denzel's character does not die and goes back to the place where it all happened (The brainwashing). The FBI has put him on witness protection and all the implants have been removed. That is why his head is shaved in the last scene. I think this movie is too hard for most reviewers to understand. This is a movie for smart people.,The Manchurian Candidate
294,w1rc,"Not Very Impressed, I'm Afraid..............",1,17 December 2004,"You know, sometimes it's better to not try to improve on a good thing. In this case I refer to the 2004 remake of Richard Condon's classic Cold War tale THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I have always thought the original was one of the best-made thrillers of all time and so I was curious to see the remake when it was released. I am afraid I was very disappointed. Not only did they change the story in an attempt to update it and add modern technology to the mix but they totally destroyed the original characterizations of the pro principal characters, Raymond Shaw and Bennett Marco. Another poor attempt was to improve on Angela Lansbury's outstanding performance in the original film of Eleanor Shaw. That performance was so powerful to me that every time I ever saw Ms Lansbury I kept seeing Raymond's mother. The penultimate bitch! In any event I consider the 2004 version to be a poor attempt at retelling this classic tale and would advise others who have some familiarity with the original film to avoid it. However if you have not seen the original it's not too bad and maybe worth your time. If you are in this category I would strongly advise you to see the original and let's hear what you think.",The Manchurian Candidate

I found myself thoroughly engaged and not once did my attention waver. Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep are all excellently cast. Their acting is flawless.The title, The Manchurian Candidate, is puzzling for much of the movie then begins to become clearer as the story unfolds. The setting is 2004 and the plot involves not only consequences of the 1991 Gulf War but the political arena as well. It is especially interesting in the post 9-11 era in which we live.

Denzel, Meryl, Jon, etc... were amazing in this movie together. I don't know why it only has a 6.7 rating.Also, it was a very appropriate movie for a US Election year.

297,spencer422,One of the best movies of 2004,8,4 January 2005,"""A comic romp?"" Hardly...Not always taut, but almost always engrossing, The Manchurian Candidate is a creepy, solid political chiller. The Great Triumverate: I knew when I was watching the movie that that's how I'd refer to Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Shrieber in this review. Their performances were masterful. I don't think I've ever seen Denzel be anything less than excellent, so I won't dwell on the fact that he gives a fantastic performance. Yawn. We all know he rocks. Liev Shrieber has grown into one hell of a commanding presence on screen. His portrayal of the tortured and smothered Raymond Shaw is riveting. And Meryl Streep, as usual, makes it so you cannot take your eyes off her when she's on screen. Mere words cannot describe how wonderful and powerful an actress this woman is. She's one of those rare entertainers who lives up to the hype. She blows me away. This movie is creepy, creepy. It's great at creating a claustrophobic, slightly surreal atmosphere of paranoia. Halfway through the movie you may find yourself wondering if there are cameras hidden in your heating vents, filming your every move. There is some wonderful scary--almost bordering on horror-like--imagery in the film. I dug it. This is why I referred to the film as a political chiller, as opposed to political thriller. It really is a chilling film. And that ""chill factor"" is one of its strongest aspects. Eleanor Prentiss (Meryl Streep) has to be one of the most disgusting mother figures ever portrayed on screen. Not only is she calculating and domineering (understatement of the year you'll find if you watch this movie), her feelings for her son border on incestuous. And in one daring scene that border is crossed. It is repugnant. It is powerful. It's scenes like that, scenes that push the envelope (I mean, I was really disturbed...felt I needed a shower after watching it) that make me excited about watching movies. Meanwhile, Liev Shrieber and Denzel Washington play characters almost ridiculously anathema to Eleanor: tortured, honorable men who, at all times, and against great odds, struggle to do the right thing. Both men give heart-wrenching performances, imbuing their characters with incredible integrity and (unlikely, considering their predicament) warmth. You know the drill. Now's the part where I bitch. I thought the film's pacing was a little off in some spots. Some scenes seemed to drag, while others didn't last long enough for me (probably any scene with Meryl Streep, 'cuz I could watch that woman read a phone book and be riveted.) I felt the movie could have shaved 10 or 15 minutes off its length. I was a bit--and remain--confused about the end of the film. I won't get into much detail because I don't want to give away spoilers, but I didn't understand a.) if the federal agents were aware that Bennett was going to attempt an assassination b.) that he was under mind control c.) if Shaw was purposely trying to get shot. The end left me feeling a bit befuddled. In fact, if any of you reading this review have seen the film, I'd appreciate some clarification. The Manchurian Candidate is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Yes, I watched it in 2005, but you know what I mean. Great performances and an extradordinarily effective creepy atmosphere combine to make one hell of a solid, quality film. I highly recommend you give this a watch. I was so intrigued by the film, I've decided to watch the original to compare and contrast.",The Manchurian Candidate
298,carl6855,Washington is not enough,2,28 January 2005,If you are able to suspend logic and disbelief and you have a passion for conspiracy theories you might rate this movie a six out of ten. I'm not one of those people. The flow of the story is choppy and fragmented. The cinematography was actually quite good. It's the telling of the story itself that lacks so much. A story should unfold opening new perspectives and ideas as it pulls the viewer through this temporary world. This movie did none of that; it slapped the reader with new twists but at such an agonizingly slow and predictable pace that I was constantly tempted to hit the fast forward button. The only reason I kept watching to the end was the strong performance of Denzel Washington. Washington is such a fine actor; he's head and shoulders above this sort of cheap flick but even his talent is not enough to make this movie worthwhile.,The Manchurian Candidate

300,italianirish1352,Really quite terrible,1,12 April 2007,"Honestly, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. It's plot was terrible, and not at all cohesive. It was about a man who had dreams, and these dreams were about a vice presidential candidate. This man's life is almost totally run by his mother, a senator played by Meryl Streep, and a company called Manchurian Global. Manchurian Global is never explained, just that it is a company dealing with private equities. Meryl Streep works with this company, and this is a very confusing part. She is more famous than her son, yet she herself didn't run for vice president. There is no background whatsoever on any of the characters. The filming was terrible, because every time there was a conversation, the actor looked into the camera. This didn't appeal to me whatsoever. The best part of the entire movie was Jon Voight, who wasn't in it enough, which was disappointing. I only saw it on TV, so hopefully they explain more in the unedited version. Terrible, and I would never recommend it to anyone, unless I wanted to see them suffer. There is no 0 out of 10, so I give it a 1.",The Manchurian Candidate

The story-writer leaves some gaps in between the movie, giving you some room for thinking, makes the audience think... what actually happened in Kuwait. The bad part of the movie is the characters inside, don't have much chance to build up their personal characteristics. But, its OK, cos its a thriller, everything in the movie goes like the jet plane. You sit down and follow where the characters go, what the character do.Anothing thing, the things that you thought to be might not be the way you think they are. the movie actually got me hooked to my chair, seems that you might just 5 min of an important plot, you are missing A lot of bread in the bread trail.

But the film, very well made and very well acted, shows an absolute lack of realism and credibility from beginning to end. That is his flaw and is a very heavy flaw. His apparently political criticism is shadowed by this fact. And is a very hard fact that moves all the movie to the field of a near-sci-fi film. Added to that, we have that the bad people are so bad and diabolical -and do things so terrible-, the good people are so patriotic and flawless. There is no gray tones in this film, only very black and very white ones. The actor's work, the director's work and the mis en scene are the positive side of the film, but cannot balance his negative side: the plot. The plot absolutely sinks this film, to the very bottom. A very well made film with a very bad plot. The result is very disappointing.",The Manchurian Candidate
303,s-j-kretschman,Manchurian Candidate,8,28 November 2005,"In the last decade or so, remaking classic movies has been on the incline. Though older generations criticize remaking these films, the newer generations are happy to see them with the latest theatrical technology. The remake I am going to be reviewing is called ""The Manchurian Candidate"". In my opinion, the remake is superior to the original. Though the acting was great in the original, I am more of a fan of Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep.The synopsis of the movie is this: Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) and Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) were part of a platoon of soldiers kidnapped and brainwashed in Desert Storm. Ten years later, Shaw, a ""war hero"", runs for vice president while Marco, label paranoid by the government, eventually remembers being kidnapped and discovers that Shaw's mother (Meryl Streep) played a big part in the brainwashing. Bennett must now convince Shaw that the brainwashing really happened. Washington does a superb job as the hero; he isn't the flashy, perfect hero that we usually see in movies these days. Schreiber also does an excellent job in this movie as well. His character is the innocent victim. He is a good person but is under the control of his evil, power-hungry mother. Streep steals the show though. Her character is so manipulative and evil that is was just great to watch. The director, Jonathan Demme, does an excellent job guiding this movie along. The camera work that he utilizes really adds to the suspense of the film.Overall, I think that any fan of suspense movies should go out to see this film. It is very creepy in the beginning and then gets better as you figure out what is going on. The actors all give an excellent performance and are lead by a great director.",The Manchurian Candidate

I must say that the background pictures on the disk where not so inviting. I started to watch it and I thought it didn't look that bad. My little brother was also watching the movie so didn't want him to go cry all night if he saw something. Another problem was that I rented the movie from a cheep corner store that used their own DVD cases so you couldn't even read the back info. Well, better than nothing. When I first saw the guy talking about the nightmares he had been having was when I started to have second thoughts. Although I continued to watch the movie and I turned out to be a very well done movie. It has a very strong storyline and Washington gave a very strong performance.

The psychological drama involved gives us the certainty that nothing is the way it appears.there's always something more, a something little extra. We do have a trick mind.We do have people to control that.Nothing supernatural.It's all about the way intelligence and knowledge are used.
