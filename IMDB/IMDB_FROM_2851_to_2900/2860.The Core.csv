0,bkoganbing,Swank Jumpstarts The Planet,8,18 October 2009,"In between her two Oscar winning roles in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby, Hilary Swank got to save the Earth in The Core. The film is a big budget maximum special effects science fiction disaster thriller which was so common in the Seventies. The only thing it lacked was a bunch old time movie names being put in harm's way of the disaster. Of course between then and now those who might have rated guest star roles have either gone to the great beyond or are in nursing homes.I don't understand the trashing this film has gotten in certain quarters. Hilary Swank is always good even if the films she appears aren't always of the quality of her two Oscar winners. She gets to work with hunky Aaron Eckhardt in saving the planet whose magma core has stopped its own rotation, causing all kinds of strange disasters all over the globe.Swank is the pilot, Eckhardt a scientist and Delroy Lindo the designer of a prototype machine for exploring the inner reaches of the earth and the high temperatures it has. It's getting pressed into service fast so that Swank and the group can deposit nuclear bombs in strategic places and set them off. That's the plan, but there's a lot going both within her crew and up top at the command center where people have some conflicting agendas.I liked the special effect very much and the film keeps the tension going throughout. On the top the efforts of DJ Qualls should be noted as he keeps something nasty from happening with some creative work that his hacker character is capable of. The Core is a very well made science fiction thriller with the attention on the action and at a tense pace that never lets up until the very end. I wouldn't miss it.",The Core
1,Leofwine_draca,Modern-day version of a 1950s B-movie,6,14 May 2016,"THE CORE is a '50s B-movie writ large. It may not be a brilliant film, but it successfully taps the 'anything goes' mentality of a schlocky black-and-white sci fi epic and updates the formula to modern times. In essence the movie itself is about a crew drilling down into the core of the earth; if you're looking for more depth (hah) than that, then look elsewhere. However, the decision was then made to add some familiar 'disaster' scenes to the mix, thus increasing the running time to over two hours in the process and making this movie way too long. With half an hour cut out, the tension and story would have been tighter and it wouldn't have that bloated Hollywood blockbuster feel to it.Of course, the 1959 epic JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH with James Mason is THE drilling-into-the-Earth movie and THE CORE doesn't come close. Ironically, the special effects are worse than in that film; despite replacing tacky dinosaurs with CGI effects of molten rock and running lava, all of the 'outside' scenes of the craft heading underground are poor-looking in the extreme. However, I did like the 'global disaster' set pieces which are thrown in to keep the film exciting. Highlights include: falling pigeons in Trafalgar Square; super-storms in Rome; people dropping down dead in a US city and my favourite moment, when a hole in the Earth's atmosphere sends down a heat ray that melts the Golden Gate bridge – a wonderful and surprisingly sadistic moment.Speaking of sadism, THE CORE sets about offing crew members with relish, imaginatively inventing the most horrific deaths in existence for these poor saps. One guy is slowly crushed to death; another is blown to pieces; a third literally melts in the lava and a fourth burns alive. It would be pretty disturbing, had the film more realism. I didn't mind the script, which has some authentic-sounding dialogue in places, and you can't fault a movie that name-checks one of my favourite magazines. There's also some good humour, like the 'yes, yes, and the core is made of cheese!' quip that Stanley Tucci's scientist character utters. There's not as much annoying flag-waving as in Armageddon, although the pay-off (using a bomb to save the world) is virtually the same.The casting ain't bad either. Aaron Eckhart (THE DARK NIGHT) excels as the rugged lead; Hilary Swank is the tough-cookie pilot forced to make some drastic decisions. I didn't care for Stanley Tucci's acting, but I did appreciate the presence of Tcheky Karyo (KISS OF THE DRAGON) in a good-guy role for once – in fact, he's my favourite character in the film.",The Core
2,SnoopyStyle,Poor science but better fun,5,12 October 2013,"The core of the earth has stopped spinning, and its protective magnetic field is disappearing. The world starts to suffer from unusual disasters. The only people that could stop it is a disparate group of individuals who must travel to the center of the earth and set off some nuclear warheads.It's a good excuse to blow up all the world's best places. The science is passable as these doomsday scenario goes. It's not the worst sci-fi idea. This has some fun moments. They had fun blowing stuff up. The story moves along nicely. It's fun even with DJ Qualls 'hacking' the earth. The CG is top notch. There isn't anything wrong with that part. It's a big budget treatment of a sci-fi B-movie concept.",The Core
3,Prismark10,Deep impact,6,24 July 2018,"The Core is the flipside of movies such as Deep Impact and Armageddon. It really is a straightlaced version of Journey to the Centre of the Earth with all the cheesy fantasy bits ripped out and replaced with bad science and singing whales.The Earth's magnetic field has gone to pot. People die because their pacemakers have suddenly switched off. Birds fly into buildings in London. Even the Space Shuttle misses its landing spot.Dr Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) a brilliant Geophysicist professor has a theory that the core of the planet has stopped revolving and it is causing havoc with the magnetic field. The American government has an audacious plan to kickstart the planet's core by devising a special ship to drill down the earth's core and causing a massive nuclear explosion.Piloted by two Nasa astronauts, Beck Childs (Hilary Swank) and Bob Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and a motley crew of brilliant scientists. The team begins its mission with time running short. However a crew member perishes one by one due to the adverse conditions and bad luck.The film is too long, the special effects are poor but the movie is fun even if the script is just nonsense.",The Core
4,claudio_carvalho,"A Reasonable Adventure, With Non-Charismatic Characters and Total Lack of Humor",6,7 May 2004,"After some mysterious events with some pigeons, Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) concludes that the core of planet Earth stopped revolving, affecting the magnetic fields of the planet. The American government gathers a group of scientists with different specializations, and two experienced NASA pilots, to travel to the center of the Earth to rotate its core again using explosives. Although having a good cast, with Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Tchéky Karyo, Delroy Lindo, Bruce Greenwood, Aaron Eckhart among others, something does not work in this movie. The story is full of clichés, like most of the films of this genre, and this theme was awfully presented in `Deep Core' (2000). But I believe that the greatest problem of this film is the lack of humor and charisma of the characters, which are not well developed, making the plot `too serious'. Only Josh Keyes has these characteristics, but he has no chemistry with Hilary Swank. The effects are reasonable and in the end, this film is only a reasonable and forgettable adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `O Núcleo'  (`The Core')",The Core
5,kosmasp,Digging away,7,26 December 2020,"Maybe this movie came a bit too late ... this seems fairly at home with the 90s catastrophe movies. And if you consider it that way and maybe even watch it with or rather through that lens, you may be able to enjoy this quite a bit. It's not a bad movie you see.It is rather predictable of course and checks certain boxes and has quite a lot of cliches and (mis)conceptions of certain individuals or groups (like hackers and others). Still you can see how much fun the cast is having and that does translate on screen. It's (not) the end of the world as we know it ...",The Core
6,gavin6942,Not Terrible,6,10 October 2017,"The only way to save Earth from catastrophe is to drill down to the core and set it spinning again.Strangely enough, the worst part of this film is the part about them drilling into the core. Or, in other words, the entire second half. The practicality of it is so nonsensical that it makes ""Armageddon"" look plausible.However, the first half is quite good. Aaron Eckhart is wonderful and a convincing scientist. The discussions of theoretical matters is quite interesting. I did not realize, for example, that the core of the earth is as big as Mars! (Yes, it's true.) The problem only really starts when these theories get tested in a silly way.",The Core
7,jboothmillard,The Core,5,18 December 2006,"Of all the disaster movie ideas they've had, this is a good new approach to natural disaster, but the film is just not that realistic enough, even with many special effects. Basically the Earth's core of mantle stops rotating which if not sorted will cause catastrophic consequences, and it starts with birds accidentally attacking people, lightning storms and dramatic heat waves. Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) located the problem in the centre of the planet, Maj. Rebecca Childs (Insomnia's Hilary Swank) can pilot a ship, Dr. Ed 'Braz' Brazzleton (Ransom's Delroy Lindo) has the technology to build the ship equipped to resist high heat, and use it for power, Dr. Conrad Zimsky (The Terminal's Stanley Tucci) knows just as much as Josh about the core activity, and Theodore Donald 'Rat' Finch (Road Trip's DJ Qualls) can stop people from finding out any big news with his huge computer hacking intelligence. Along the way to the Earth's core to set off explosions to restart the rotation people die, but they would, even with a ridiculous story with a realistic incident. Also starring Richard Jenkins as Gen. Thomas Purcell, Tchéky Karyo as Dr. Serge Leveque, Bruce Greenwood as Cmdr. Robert Iverson and Alfre Woodard as Dr. Talma Stickley. Worth watching!",The Core
8,Tweekums,A far-fetched but rather fun sci-fi/disaster movie,7,20 September 2015,"Strange things start happening around the Earth; everybody with a heart pacemaker in one area drops dead at the same time, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square start attacking people then the navigation systems for a space shuttle almost cause it to crash; only some quick thinking by the copilot, Major Rebecca Childs, prevent a tragedy. Government agencies summon Dr. Josh Keyes, a geologist to ask if it could be caused by an enemy weapon; he reassures them that it couldn't but further research gives a far more worrying reason it would appear that the Earth's core has stopped rotating and if it can't be restarted in three months the planet is doomed! He believes this is impossible but a scientist, Dr. Edward Brazzelton, who has been working on a project by himself may have the answer; a craft that can travel through solid rock and molten magma to deliver a nuclear payload to the Earth's inner core! A team of six, which includes Keyes, Childs and Brazzelton, will take the craft, known as Virgil, into the centre of the Earth dealing with an assortment of problems on the way; inevitably not all of them would make it.The problem with most disaster movies it that they take themselves far too seriously after seeing a shuttle being landed in the LA river I knew that wasn't going to be a problem here. The science on show is so far-fetched it is quite funny one certainly has to be willing to put your brain in neutral to enjoy this but if you can it is rather fun. Once the more serious effects of the problem become apparent we gets some typical disaster movie scenes; Rome is destroyed in an electrical storm and the Golden Gate Bridge is microwaved to destruction These sort of things may be disaster movie clichés but at least we avoid the worst cliché of the genre seeing ordinary people as main characters as they try to escape the problem the only people dwelt on are those solving the problem. The cast do a decent enough job so we care enough about the characters. Overall this may not be a great movie but it is worth watching on TV or picking up if the DVD is in the bargain bin.",The Core
9,BA_Harrison,Down Down Deeper and Down.,5,13 March 2011,"As end-of-the-world movie scenarios go, the core of the earth ceasing to spin as the result of top-secret seismic weapon testing is pretty unbelievable, but the solution devised to rectify this problem proves to be even more preposterous: a team of scientists are assembled to construct and pilot a craft capable of 'drilling' to the centre of the Earth, where a nuclear bomb can be detonated to set the core spinning again. Fortunately for the future of mankind, the technology required for such a machine already exists and a desperate mission is soon underway.Although this is one seriously idiotic movie, I have a sneaking admiration for its creators: you need some serious chutzpah to even pitch such a dumb idea, let alone actually get it made! What's even more amazing than the fact that The Core got a green light at all is that, for a while, the audacious, logic-free nature of the script even seems to work in its favour, delivering cheesy thrills and spills during some fun indicators of the impending apocalypse (the space shuttle landing in LA's storm drains; people dropping dead when their pacemakers quit; pigeons going crazy in London; a destructive lightning storm in Rome).Sadly, once the action finally heads underground, matters become far less interesting. The sight of nondescript blobs of CGI swirling around the craft soon becomes seriously monotonous, and there's a limit to the variety of obstacles that can be introduced miles beneath the planet's surface; one by one, the crew do the predictable 'heroic sacrifice' thing, strictly by-the-numbers disaster movie nonsense that is extremely repetitive and pretty dull. By the time the team (or what's left of them) have reached their target to carry out the final part of their explosive plan, you'll be yearning for them to just ditch their nuclear payload, get the hell out, and for the film to end (whether the mission is a success or not!).That would be too easy though... instead, we discover more about the government cover-up of 'Project Destini' (yawn), are subject to even more corny (or should that be 'core-ny'?) displays of heroism, suffer mind numbing plot contrivances (the craft generates energy from heat and sounds like a whale—very convenient, as it happens), and see waaay too much of bloody D.J. Qualls, who plays the irritating super-hacker helping our team from the surface.",The Core
10,moonspinner55,"""You're not really a leader until you've lost...""",7,12 January 2008,"Thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure. Earth is in trouble yet again, but this time--instead of intergalactic woes--it appears the liquid which rotates around the planet's inner-core is no longer spinning, causing havoc for the globe (and an eventual breakdown of the shield which protects us from boiling to death). The Pentagon (apparently headed up by the most obstinate Armed Forces General in recent memory) recruits a wily, brilliant desert hermit to design a ship that will drill down to the Earth's inner core, taking him on the journey, as well as two Air Force pilots from NASA, two professors and the foremost authority of Geomagnetics. Perhaps Geophysicists would be the best audience to test the movie's scientific b.s. factor--but, if it's far-fetched, so what? It's a lot of fun just the way it is, and the camaraderie which develops between our heroes is not only surprising, but genuinely affecting. The special effects are quite admirable (with the possible exception of the destruction sequence in Rome, which feels hasty and plugged in). I'm not sure exactly where Space Station control-room engineer Alfre Woodard fits in here (she looks uncertain, too), and DJ Qualls is given far too much screen-time as a delinquent whiz-kid from M.I.T. addicted to Hot Pockets (ha ha), but the interaction on-board ship is bracing and orchestrated with a great deal of heart and humanity. *** from ****",The Core

12,Theo Robertson,Better Than Many People Claim,6,28 February 2005,"I remember the critics really laid into THE CORE on its initial release . Granted the central premise of Planet Earth stopping on its axis is ridiculous but the script structure compensates for the bizarre scientific impossilbilities . Look at the opening scene with people dropping dead in Boston , it does its job of drawing the audience into the story . It doesn't stop there because a few moments later we cut to London and see a remake of THE BIRDS . Not not good enough for you ? Well wait around because they'll hopefully be a disaster around the corner that will appeal to you It's never explained in any convincing detail how the Earth's core stopping spinning can cause these effects but we're talking about a Hollywood movie not some theory put forward by Stephen Hawking . Unlikely events do happen in Hollywood movies as if you hadn't noticed so when people criticise this movie as being "" Dumb "" they're perhaps taking life a little too seriously For what it is - A dumb movie with special effects and an action adventure concept - THE CORE certainly succeeds . We're shown a ballsy heroine played by Hilary Swank who can actually act and unlike say the very similar Armageddon we don't have to put up with macho American flag waving at every opportunity .If you're looking for an entertaining pop corn movie THE CORE should do the trick",The Core

14,Boba_Fett1138,It's already a forgotten movie.,4,11 January 2006,"It's three years later and who still remembers or talks about this movie? It says something about the quality of the movie that's just plain poor. The story is implausible and filled with unlikely and yet at the same time also predictable events. ""The Core"" is a formulaic disaster flick with all the stereotypical and predictable events and characters in it you could expect. Yes, they even managed to put a love-story into the movie!I don't know what it is with Jon Amiel movies. I thought that his movie ""Copycat"" was great and is a bit of an underrated thriller but that movie also already was filled with unoriginal moments and 'borrowed' heavily from other movies. ""The Core"" does the same and its a terribly predictable and because of that also not so fun movie to watch. No, Mr. Amiel is not the most talented person in the business at the moment.The concept of the movie was already ridicules and the execution of it makes the story even more implausible. The movie is filled with unlikely and unoriginal events. Of course during the 'disasters', the national monuments of the countries are the first things to be destroyed. How original. And seriously, did every character had to die in a heroic sacrificing way?Another problem with the movie is that it doesn't have likable characters. We never really get to care about any of them and because of that also the emotional moments in the movie are flawed. Perhaps this is also due to the dialog that is just plain horrible at times. It's a waste of a great cast. Hilary Swank, Tchéky Karyo, Delroy Lindo, DJ Qualls, those are some good actors but their talent is wasted in the movie.From a movie like this you could at least expect some great special effects but also with that the movie disappoints. The special effects are below average and they never know to convince the viewer.I can think of no reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. Granted that it does have some entertainment value but the cheesy story and characters make this movie far from a must see.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Core
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"If you can turn your brain off, it's harmless entertainment",6,19 November 2012,"The core of the Earth has stopped spinning, and will have to be started back up, by getting a team down to it. That's essentially all you need to know about the story, to know if it's your kind of flick, to know what it's about. The crew(composed of scientists, because who better to brutally violate the laws thereof?) contain the ultrasmart(on a ship of geniuses) astronaut Beck(Swank, possibly the only in the main cast, all kidnapped from some indie picture, who doesn't take this as camp(...to be fair, the film-makers have made the same mistake, this takes itself too seriously)), geophysicist Keyes(Eckhart, clearly having a hoot, given many intentionally bad jokes to tell) and the arrogant Zimsky(Tucci, especially over the top). DJ Qualls, the comic relief(the humor, by the way, is hit and miss), albeit having a role that suits him as an eccentric hacker, does not get that much screen time, sadly. Can they techno-babble their way through the various problems that arise? This has many of the same elements as Armageddon, in fact, there are those that would say it's almost an exact copy... I'd add that this is, y'know, tolerable. We don't have to suffer Bay's offensive stereotypes(admittedly, he hadn't delivered his worst when this came out), this isn't obnoxious or overstimulating, it keeps moving throughout(no long, supposedly, not actually, dramatic sequences that stop its pace dead... in fact, the 121 minutes sans credits, or 129 with, swim along quite nicely, and this is genuinely engaging) and the characters aren't too bad, if they are fairly thin. I doubt I'll remember this for long after my viewing, and it definitely seemed to have fewer(not no) flaws(you get carried away, what can I say) while watching it than thinking back to it, but it's exciting, dumb fun for the duration. The cinematography can be pretty nice, the FX(and we of course get destruction of various landmarks) are quite solid and while the CGI is great, they do not rely purely on it, realizing that mixing in practical(models, etc.) stuff is more convincing. Dialog can get fairly questionable. Christopher Young gives this an evocative score. There is a bit of disturbing content and violence, a little blood and brief strong language in this. The DVD comes with an interesting, informational director's commentary, a 19 minute deconstruction of the visual effects, 14 and a half minutes of good deleted/extended scenes(with the option of hearing Jon Amiel talk about them; it's compelling), and the 11 minute featurette To The Core and Back: The Making of The Core which I will review on its own page here on the site.

16,view_and_review,Why save a town when you can save the world?,4,11 May 2007,"It's Armageddon all over again. Except this time we have to go to the core of the Earth instead of the core of an asteroid. I am a fan of action adventure movies that involve last ditch self-sacrificing efforts in order to save the day. Now... usually saving the day means saving a life, saving a building, saving a town, maybe even saving an entire country, but rarely ever does it mean saving planet Earth. It looks as if the writers and producers want to go beyond the minor mere tasks of saving a few lives, they now have to go to the ultimate level of saving every human life. This was good in science fictions like ""Independance Day"", or others like that because the foes were aliens and it fit. In ""The Core"", the foe is the planet Earth itself. This is a whole new level of stretching the imagination, and I, for one see it as a little too egotistical.A small elite band of scientists and such journey to the core of the earth to set off some well timed explosives to disrupt the cataclysmic activity of the Earth's center. Of course there are the heroic martyrdoms along the way while leaving just the obvious two characters alive. Two characters that should have died as well except for some insignificant statement muttered by one of them days earlier. That one insignificant statement that someone happened to listen to and remember and correlate to saving the last two survivors. *Ahem cliché ahem* All in all the movie was slightly entertaining, but in the end just a planet sized cliché.",The Core

Saving the world still requires the self sacrifice of some or all of a motley crew of a specialist vessel engaged on a suicide mission, though.The problem is that the earth's heart has stopped, so to speak, and a kind of mole train which can swim through molten rock moles off down through the crust to apply defibrillation to the core by setting off atom bombs.The science here is, I think, absolute nonsense, but a good cast plays it straight faced, and decent effects help to ensure that there is a degree of panache in the execution of the mission and, indeed, the film.This is big, daft nonsense.

The Pacemaker scene reminded me of The Happening and the other disasters just consisted of really bad special effects and bad music.Eckhart and Swank look bemused by the whole thing, and once they are all on board, the cast may as well have numbers on there back so they can spell it out for the audience who dies first, who sacrifices themselves, who lives, and who has the most surprising death.It's devoid of tension, or urgency, and you know it's going to be fine at the end.

19,Wuchakk,"Wannabe ""Armageddon""",5,31 December 2016,"Released in early 2003 and directed by Jon Amiel, ""The Core"" is a sci-fi disaster flick starring Hilary Swank as a hotshot pilot who ""flies"" a giant drill into the core of the earth with a team of experts (Aaron Eckhart, Tchéky Karyo, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo & Bruce Greenwood). Why? The earth's magnetic fields have gone wild and the only answer is to journey to the center of the planet, plant a series of nuclear charges and get out, thereby restoring the proper magnetic fields. DJ Qualls and Alfre Woodard offer assistance topside. The plot is a meshing of 1959's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and 1998's ""Armageddon,"" but it's not as entertaining as either. One problem is that it lacks star power for such a blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, the main cast members are stalwart in their roles, but none of them were top-drawer actors at the time; and only Swank went on to a fairly stellar film career, although Greenwood has done pretty well and Eckhart has done okay. I'm just saying that they're a far cry from Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan (all from ""Armageddon"").Despite the incredible disaster scenario and the dubious science (I guess that's why they call it science-FICTION, huh?), the story's fairly engaging, occasionally thrilling and sometimes even wondrous in the manner of 1966's ""Fantastic Voyage"" and 1979's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" The main characters being stuck in and around an earth-burrowing ship also bring to mind movies like 1979's ""Alien"" and 1989's ""The Abyss."" Yet ""The Core"" somehow comes across as second-rate to these hallmark films(not that I'm a big fan of ""The Abyss,"" but it's better than this). Jon Amiel directed 1993's underrated ""Sommersby"" and 1999's ""Entrapment,"" but when ""The Core"" flopped at the box office (not majorly, but it still failed to make a profit) he left behind feature films for TV directing, which he didn't even do until two years after ""The Core."" Still, it's worth checking out if you like the cast and are in the mode for an earth-threatening disaster flick. The film runs 135 minutes and was shot mainly in British Columbia, but with scenes from around the US and world (e.g. the Golden Gate Bridge, Rome, Paris and Trafalgar Square, England).GRADE: C",The Core

21,sddavis63,A Mess!,2,6 March 2004,"I saw the description of this movie's plot and thought that it sounded rather good. Then, I made a tragic mistake: I actually watched it! This movie is a mess from start to finish.The plot is rather silly. A problem with the earth's outer core causes a breakdown in the electromagnetic field that basically means that we all have just a few months until we're fried by the sun's radiation. The movie never really explains what has caused this problem (except that it has something to do with a government experiment called ""Destiny""). However, a rather unusual team of a young scientist (Aaron Echardt), his French friend (Tcheky Karyo), an arrogant older scientist who helped cause the problem in the first place (Stanley Tucci) an eccentric scientist/inventor (Delroy Lindo) and a hot-shot space shuttle pilot (Hilary Swank - I know, that piece of casting is worth a giggle) are called upon to save us all from destruction.Frankly, this movie is boring. I mercifully passed out for about a half an hour and awoke to discover that it hadn't become any more interesting in the interim. It is an absolute waste of time to watch this.
I will in the end give it a rating of 2/10. It would have been 1, but it did teach me a little bit. Not being a scientist, I didn't know that the earth's outer core of molten lead rotated. So, for that bit of knowledge gained, it gets bumped up by a point. But it's still a mess.",The Core

23,MLDinTN,one of the most unbelievable plots ever...,6,20 January 2005,"but I thought it was pretty good, much better than another sci-fi film in this genre, Armaggadon, which was terrible. At least, in the Core, there is suspense and thrills and explanations are given, even though it sounds like things like that could never happen. And certainly there would never be some ship that could travel through lava that is thousands degrees hot and not melt and have everyone survive. And it really got ridiculous when they crash land on this spiky looking piece of ground and they get out of the ship and survive. I mean, wouldn't it have either been unbearablely hot or cold right there. And then they had to come up with another ridiculous idea to have a happy ending. And they had to have the usual snotty guy that you don't want to make it, but in this film, they even had all the good guys die except the 2 you knew would survive.Also, I wonder why Hillary Swank took this role. She has an Oscar and generally takes the dramatic roles. Maybe her career isn't going so great although she's getting acclaim for her recent movie directed by Clint Eastwood.FINAL VERDICT: I found the plot to be beyond absurd, but I didn't let that ruin the film. I thought it was fun and had some thrills, and certainly better than other natural disaster films like Armaggaden and Twister.",The Core

Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, and Hilary Swank all turned in very fine performances.I also must commend the special effects.

Nevertheless, the first half of the movie is pretty specular in its various depictions of the visual production of various world disasters occurring while the earth's core has stop spinning and thus supposedly allowing the magnetic bubble that protects earth from deadly radiation crumbles. Some of the subsequent scenes, especially in 9,000-degree temperature is pretty impressive and intense. And the impending demise of our protagonists follows a predictable course which in this instance is actually a plus considering what the audience has to experience as less than a superior special effects effort for the unknown images of inner earth.

29,Rodrigo_Amaro,Resurrected the Fun in Me,10,18 April 2010,"In simple and boring words ""The Core"" is another movie like ""Armageddon"" and ""Independence Day"" where our planet is going to be destroyed and a bunch of people is called to save the Earth. In more complex and interesting words ""The Core"" is a very highly entertaining movie where you're going to be taken to a different place where Hollywood almost haven't appeared before: to the center of Earth.Strange and bizarre happenings are starting to damage our planet (birds shocking against statues, people fainting in the middle of business meeting or in the middle of the street, burning bridges). This happens all across the world. An American General (Richard Jenkins from ""The Visitor"" and ""Burn After Reading"") convene a fantastic team of experts to see what's going on, if it is a terrorist attack or something similar. This team discovered that Earth's core has stopped for unknown reasons and what they need to do is the enter in the core and make it run again. Another group joins the first group and they start to develop a subterranean machine (something like a space shuttle) that can cross the depth of Earth.The crew is formed by scientists (played by Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, Tcheky Karyo) and two astronauts (Hilary Swank and Bruce Greenwood). They count with the help of a hacker (DJ Qualls) and a commander of the Space Program (Alfre Woodard). Like any movies of the genre they have their differences, something funny always happens when they are summoned but they stay together until the end of the mission. And of course the tragic happenings.""The Core"" is filled with many scientific references (I don't know if they are accurate). In many films these references are boring and dominates the story. This isn't the case here. Aaron Eckhart's character made many of the scientific things looks simple here, showing examples (the apple scene representing the Earth). Everything was made to be fun, to entertain and it's very easy to follow what happens. The story is pure cliché, the visual effects sometimes works sometimes not, the cast is fantastic (Tucci and Karyo were the most funniest, in a good way), a real good work from Jon Amiel (""Sommersby""). I was really impressed by the quality of ""The Core"". It really made get stuck in my seat, enjoy everything and resurrected the fun in me on watching a disaster movie after watching many movies that didn't work quite well to me like ""The Happening"".

It has enough non-logic for a dozen films. If you are the type who challenges everything, then move on. However, Stanley Tucci fans will like everything about his eccentric character. Unfortunately his is the only character that is somewhat developed, or remotely interesting. This is a typical everyone shows up at once and is immediately hurled into solving the crisis type movie. Who lives and who dies is really not important since we hardly know anyone to begin with. The special effects are pretty good, except the view out the front window of the ship is relentlessly redundant. Average at best. - MERK",The Core

32,Dr_Coulardeau,One more trip to the center of the earth,8,21 September 2008,"The subject is interesting. The topic is fascinating. The treatment is quite reassuring. But the ideology is hateful. Imagine some natural, geological or cosmic catastrophe meaning the end of the earth, hence of humanity. The loss of the magnetic field of the earth is one possibility since it has been going down for a few decades and no one can explain. If such a phenomenon were truly happening, the normal reaction would be to bring all scientists around the world together to find a solution. There cannot be any moral and acceptable salvation for humanity, or even a little part of humanity if it does not mobilize everyone, every country, every nation. The film is unluckily hijacked by the military that imposes the vision of some aggressive attack from an enemy. They seem to listen to the scientists and politicians for a while, but at the same time they have their own Plan B ready which is purely military. That is why the military should have no power whatsoever and their finances should be scrutinized constantly, for them not to be able to have their own plans. That's why the finances of the military are supposed to be voted by Congress, but is what Congress votes always clear? Certainly not and that is true in every country. There are some blind or invisible lines hidden in some other budgets. That is revealing about a lack of democracy in our countries: the armed forces are not 100% open to public scrutiny and they do things they have never been allowed to do. The film though takes a clear stand against this and manages to defeat Plan B, thanks to a hacker in the place. We could of course wonder why they brought that hacker into the sanctuary. But for the film he was needed and was able to fulfill his promise. I must say I did not like his nose. Too visible, too outstanding. A hacker is supposed to be absolutely invisible, hence just plain normal, average, banal, in no way conspicuous. Then the treatment of the volunteers in that last chance mission is quite flat after all. A little bit of rage but a lot of positive tension. A situation in which one must sacrifice after the other should create a real tension that could be and become negative, including the absolute loss of all reactivity in an individual who knows there is no way out. But It was a pleasant film after all.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The Core
33,johnnyboyz,Journey to the centre of the mirth.,5,10 December 2007,"The Core is a film that would have us quaking in our boots had it actually had something to say; it is also a film that would have us entertained if it weren't for the ludicrous scenes of mindless action and brainless logic. Yes, The Core is the filmic definition of brainless, disposable entertainment; the epitome of all things wrong with blockbusters these days and the reason you're going to get a child aged fourteen or below into a cinema in order to give them the feeling that they're seeing something 'epic'.Rather than be a 'disaster movie' of sorts, The Core more resembles a 'movie disaster' since we're not even given a political slant on the reasons the action in this film have to take place. People will be quick to point in the direction of The Day After Tomorrow, a film that came a year after this one and a film about global warming directed by a man who is something of an expert at portraying cataclysmic events that destroy the Western world (see Independence Day and Godzilla). So, with a magnetic field hovering around the Earth that one day decides to go all cock-eyed; it's up to a team of people to try and kick start the Earth's core that has stopped working due to this field not working all of a sudden. Let me just say that this film probably has about a million and two things wrong with it; something I am not going to do is merely list them all here but the most glaring will certainly get the nod.Firstly, character portrayal and characterisation: The experts of the subject matter visit Dr. Ed Brazzleton (Lindo); an African-American who lives on his own in the desert, in the middle of nowhere and yet has been spending the bulk of his life creating a drill of sorts that creates a perfect circle when activated at a rocky wall. It seems too perfect that this sort of technology is around and within days of becoming active thanks to a government loan  the drill is also something the American government (or anyone else, naturally) couldn't come up with themselves in order to deal with the problem. My attention is drawn to Alien vs. Predator; a film released two years later: one such scene before they go down into the icy Antarctic pyramid has someone remark at the entrance: ""It's a prefect circle; no one could've made this entrance with tools or drills on this planet."" Well, give Ed Brazzleton a call next time.Then comes the horrific stereotyping of a computer nerd named 'Rat' Finch (Qualls) who himself contributes to one of the film's more unbelievable scenes when he gives one man a free service on his phone by blowing into a chewing gum wrapper up against the phone's mechanics  a pitiful and accidentally humorous scene trying to get across the 'genius' of the character; again, do the American's (or any other country) not have anyone else? This brings me onto the actual portrayal of the Americans  the American government seem to be in charge of everything with no mention of any other country; indeed when we do get to see abroad America the scenes consist of Rome getting obliterated and London coming in with its fair share of punishment  credit here to the poster on the message boards who noticed that the Coliseum is made out of stone and thus; wouldn't have been struck by lightening. The scenes of America in peril seem added to create a counter balance so that no one would notice but it's all tongue in cheek since the shots of Rome and London are not required: if it is going to be America saving the world (with some very brief references to France in the form of Dr. Leveque (Karyo); but don't worry, he isn't around too long) then keep America in peril so that the whole war with the weather stays 'USA vs. the elements' and don't drag anyone else into it. It seems strange that director Jon Amiel, born in England, would agree to include such a thing in his film and portray every other nation as 'weak' and 'one that needs saving'.What especially reminded me that this was a brainless, dumb film was its attention to consistency. The team of absolute no-brainers, supported by their hacker cliché nerd on the surface, go down into the depths in a machine that is designed to detach its parts if one of them becomes breached so that nobody fries. My question is: what if one of the middle hulls becomes breached? Would it disconnect itself because if it did, any other hull behind it would also have to become detached. It just seems so sloppy that they would assume this wouldn't happen  as it is; only the back hull at any particular moment in time ever gets breached. After the usual suspects have had their moment of glory, it's left to the hero and the herald to 'save the day' so to speak but wait a minute: it seems ground level have an ace: something called 'DESTINI' (It actually changes later on to 'Destiny' when Finch attempts to hack in) which will achieve what they're down there for anyway  that was handy, why did they even go? Yes, The Core will infuriate and confuse simultaneously as it weaves in and out of un-believability; leaving a nasty taste in the mouth. Ironic how most of the more complicated things in this film are explained at a very basic level to highly ranked experts; now the screenwriter must explain to me exactly what he was thinking when he came up with this nonsense; and I won't accept an explanation with a peach and an aerosol can.",The Core

Directed by Jon Amiel, the film has screenplay by Cooper Layne and John Rogers. The cast attended, among others, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Bruce Greenwood and Stanley Tucci.This short presentation I wrote seems to suggest that this movie was somehow inspired by the Verne's novel ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". I don't know if it was indeed but chances are yes, as the central idea of ​​the plot is the journey to the core, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the idea is good and would have given an excellent movie if production had sought best scientific advisers to assist them. Yes, because the biggest problem with this film is the complete and utter lack of logic and plausibility.All right, when a scientific film is done there is always some mistakes but the production seems to think that the audience is totally stupid. In the past, the Earth's magnetic field has undergone changes that never led to mass extinctions, and the idea of ​​""killers holes"" in atmosphere, melting bridges thanks to solar radiation, is so absurd that fancy ask the writers if they think that we didn't go to school. There are other situations and stupid ideas in the film, which is an affront to the intelligence of those who perceive science or, at least, attended high school.In addition to these important details concerning credibility, its necessary to say that the cast didn't shine. Most actors complied well with its function but there was any notable interpretation or worthy of some spotlight.

Some people may like this claustrophobic terror, not me. When the movie is set outside, the special effects are ridiculous, particularly Rome destroyed by a magnetic storm that makes strangely explode the Coliseum.

36,Anonymous_Maxine,The biggest disaster of the year! And I don't mean that the earth's core stopped spinning!,4,9 February 2004,"The fact that The Core is a disaster movie is a little too descriptive of itself. My initial interest in seeing the movie stemmed from a piece of the preview in which the Golden Gate Bridge is destroyed, and for some reason I'm always interested in seeing movies in which major monuments are destroyed. Not that I'm interested in death and destruction, of course. Anyway, the means by which the Golden Gate ends up burning and crashing to the water below is the result of one of a great long line of massive fallacies of geologic and astronomical logic. I think that by this point, we've all heard about the fact that our air pollution is eroding the ozone layer, and that if it is completely worn away we will have no protection from the brutal direct rays of the sun. Basically you would be able to get a suntan in seconds, and if you weren't able to get out of the sun within seconds, your skin would be burning away because the ultraviolet light on your skin would have something of a similar effect as putting your arm in the microwave. Anyway, when I first heard about that years and years ago, I was maybe 9 or 10 years old and one of the majority of people who heard the story and immediately pictured a `hole in the ozone,' maybe the size of a dinner table or a small house or, in the worst case scenario, a parking lot or even a city block. As it turns out, this rumor had to be dispelled by the revelation that the `hole' was actually about the size of, you know, Arizona or something. Evidently those people involved in making The Core missed that last memo, as their ozone hole, granted one with slightly different causes, was about the size of a small parking lot, moving along nice and smoothly, roasting everything in its path. But then again, The Core is a movie about drilling to the Earth's core, in a MANNED ship, in order to plant a lot of nuclear bombs to reactivate the spin of the molten outer core and thereby save the entire planet. So logic is obviously not very high on the priority list here. That being said, let me just get to the drill bit really quick. This is one of the things that also originally inspired me to watch the movie, just because I wanted to see if they really expected us to believe that there is any drill bit on earth that can withstand the massive heat and pressure of the inside of the earth, but luckily they didn't (although they DO expect you to believe that it's possible to believe that they can build a SHIP to do that). Here's where it's important to acknowledge the suspension of disbelief in the movies, because this particular film is a test of the audience's capacity for the suspension of disbelief. Personally, I was struggling a little bit. So the `drill bit' turns out to be a lot of lasers set up on some machine that looks like the gat that Arnold used to shoot the police cars and helicopters out of the Cyberdine building in Terminator 2. Just a lot bigger. And apparently it has the ability not to drill through solid rock and turn it immediately to dust, as you might think, but it is actually able to turn it to NOTHING. For the first time in earth history, a means has been created to actually destroy matter, which is clear from the fact that they are able to drill instantly through solid rock (or, for most of the trip, MOLTEN rock and metal) and then travel through the space created. And since the matter that they drill has nowhere to go (it can hardly blow away in the wind), it follows then that it is rendered nonexistent.
I had little expectation of the movie as far as logic. I've heard that some pretty bad things would happen if, for some reason, any amount of oxygen ever found it's way to the superheated core of the earth, I guess I was more curious as to how far they would go, what things they would expect the audience to buy. It turns out that they went pretty far. Particularly odd were the scenes where the ship is flying through molten rock at high speeds, zooming back and forth, avoiding collision with diamonds that must have been 500 or 600 yards across and, even better, the scene where they accidentally drill into the top of a geode (you know, one of those rocks that appear to be shells, hollow in the center, with all the crystals formed on the inside), fall for maybe a mile or so to the bottom of it, and then find themselves broken down and pulling manually at the crystal shards that are holding them there while molten rock drips in the hole they made at the top, threatening to bury them all if they don't get out soon enough.The movie actually does create a bit of suspense in such scenes as the badly botched space shuttle landing at the beginning of the film, the scene where one of the astronauts gets crushed near the end of the film, and the scene where Delroy Lindo finds himself in a space suit trying to save the rest of the cast by braving heat that is twice what the suit is designed to sustain (meaning he was in a suit with an interior temperature that, if I remember correctly, would have been something like 9,000 degrees). The problem is that these scenes create suspense because, I like to think, we have a natural dislike of seeing someone killed or in extreme pain, and rather than fear for their logical deaths, we fear for them more at the hands of the writers than reality. Lindo's character, for example, in the above-mentioned scene, finds himself struggling against heat so intense that it shatters his glasses on his face, but doesn't affect his body until his mission is accomplished. Thus the rest of the movie works, creating a whole different world and a whole different set of human limits and natural laws under which the characters operate and live. Interesting, but I really think that the movie would have been a lot more thrilling and much better received had the audience not had to learn the laws of a completely separate world before understanding the real plight of the cast, which was the survive the onslaught of the writers' ideas, a daunting task in itself, as anyone who has seen this movie can tell you since they've also experienced it,  rather than survive and save the real world.",The Core

38,dfranzen70,"Core has chewy center, cheesy surface",5,23 September 2003,"Hollywood's gone to the outer reaches of our galaxy (not to mention others), it's plumbed the depths of the ocean, mapped dank swamps and arid deserts, but one place it hasn't gone to with any sort of regularity is the inner core itself.The Core is certainly one of those movies for which one must suspend disbelief. It's a science-fiction movie that emphasizes fiction over all; that is, the physics of the film don't hold up to snuff. If you're an engineer or physicist, you should be smart enough not to watch it - you'll just spend most of your time second-guessing the inane psuedoscience.
It seems the inner core of the Earth has stopped spinning, for some reason, and this has caused the electromagnetic  field that surrounds and protects the planet to begin to decompose. This is evidenced by, among other things, pigeons in Tralfagar Square in London suddenly veering at plate-glass windows and sundry people who wish they were extras in a less-violent movie, like Daddy Daycare or maybe Finding Nemo. At any rate, the world's leading scientists, commissioned by the military (it wouldn't be a Save the Planet from Imminent Destruction without our pals in the movie military), figure out that the core's stopped rotating, and that Something Must Be Done to get it going again.Ah, but what? We've only drilled down about 8 miles, and according to my calculations the distance from the surface to the core is .... a bit further. We must drill down, sayeth the sage scientists, and lo and behold, through the magic of movies, there's this guy in the desert who's been working on a laser rocket thingy that'll help them blast all the way down. This handy little thing is just the cure, so a crew is hastily assembled: Commander Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), Major Beck Childs (Hilary Swank), Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart), Dr. Serge Leveque (Tcheky Karyo), Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), and Dr. Ed Brazzelton.Like such doomsday movies as Armageddon, what The Core has going for it are likeable characters and a lot of nifty FX. It also has the unknown working for it; we don't know what lies beneath the thin crust of the Earth, because we haven't drilled beyond it. That allows filmmakers a lot of free reign to depict whatever the heck they want in terms of What's Down There.What The Core has going against it, however, is a predictable plot and some howlingly awful dialog. Now, it's not giving anything away to mention that at least one person doesn't make it back from this mission. It's also not giving anything away to note that there's at least one knockdown, drag-out hissy fit of a scene in which Keyes admonishes Childs for something she didn't do. It's hysterical to watch, although I suspect the emotion the director was attempting to convey was more like empathy, not euphoria. Or ennui, which is unfortunately how some of the movie felt.The Core is cheesy. No, not the actual inner core - although, come to think of it, maybe it is, since we don't know for sure what it's made of. And wouldn't that be fitting? A cheesy core for a cheesy film made by cheesy people in a cheesy society? Who's up for some Muenster?",The Core

This is a curious one, because despite such a ruthlessly stupid premise, The Core does an awful lot right.It's stacked with a surprisingly well-equipped cast, for one, with Aaron Eckhart channeling his best bottled blonde beefcake as the project lead and Hilary Swank (just a year prior to winning an Oscar) sliding into an effortless role as a fiery astronaut-turned-pilot. Character actors Bruce Greenwood and Stanley Tucci fill out the roster with equally over-achieving support roles. It's a showy, pseudo-scientific team adventure, not unlike Jules Verne's journeys a century-plus prior, and there's plenty of harmless fun to be had with that type of premise. The big set pieces are imaginative and well-realized, if completely unbelievable and convenient. The plot takes risks and makes real sacrifices, even if most of those seem misguided, happenstance, superfluous and/or preventable.The Core's biggest problem is its urge to spell everything out in a wave of absurd, hand-wavey scientific jargon that draws attention to its own fundamental shortcomings. Rather than leaving the particulars of the ship's breakneck development and construction to a mere montage, for example, it makes a point of telling us the government threw a whole lot of money at it. As if funding were the only real hurdle, the glistening key to immediate, unlimited scientific progress. It does this constantly, spelling things out where no explanation was really necessary and then flubbing all the answers. There's a feeling of insecurity behind all that, like it's apologizing for its own identity, which makes it extra-ripe for criticism. Beneath all the existential anxiety and self-loathing, tucked away in shame, is a surprisingly well-made film. Fluffy and silly, sure, but also tight and effective. In the end, though, it's a case of one step forward for every two steps back.",The Core

The 'world's' (i.e America's) top scientists come together on a journey to the centre of the earth to kick-start the it's molten core - after a failed cold war experiment has knocked it off kilter and so threatened the world. All the roles are fairly two-dimensional - it has about as much depth as a long episode of Startrek but without the cult enjoyment. Hilary Swank is quite good, if only to see her in a totally different character to her Oscar-winning performance in Boys Don't Cry (in Core she is a top NASA pilot, near genius, a capable captain, and also voluptuous, sensitive, feminine) but the part hardly stretches her abilities except to give her more experience is mainstream fare as a Ripley-with-sex-appeal.",The Core

They are just fine when they are in the core and the audience is seeing lava and humongous crystals, and the ship flying looks fine too. There were however a few parts where the effects just didn't look all that good, even for 2003. So the effects are like a 70/30, so it leans in the right direction. The issue I take with The Core is that whenever an action packed/effects driven scene isn't going on, there just isn't any good dialogue or engaging characters. The actors really do give it their all, but the source material just is not that good or deep at all. The characters really do seem like cardboard cut outs, not much depth to them, some good cool depth behind the different characters would've been great to see! 6/10 for The Core. Not quite :/",The Core
43,jaybob,I got what I expected,7,28 March 2003,"THE CORE is somewhat similiar to other disaster type films of the past. What this has & many of the others did not, is a sense of humour.None of the talented cast take there roles too seriously & thusly the improbable fantasy is quite watchable. The cast is mostly  from Independant films, so some of the faces are not overly familiar, Aaron Eckhart & Hillary Swank are the 2 lead players ably assisted by the others.  Stanley Tucci`s role is a gem as well as DJ Qualls as the computer whiz called Rat. All the production credits are first rate, & the special effects at times are awesome.

The whole thing's just annoying in a way that isn't quite overcome by it's odd bits of charm.If you're in the mood for a trashy, end of the world movie, this sorta fits that and it probably makes for decent background fodder to just glance at sparingly, but this thing is a mess that's not really worth anyone's time.",The Core

46,rosscinema,"Implausible ""Core""",4,25 October 2003,"You can't hate a film that throws out all sense of logic and plausibility and just tries to be entertaining. But how entertained can anyone be when a skinny nerd called Rat can infiltrate a government security system and demand Hot Pockets from a General? Story is about the Earths core that has stopped rotating and this causes the magnetic field around Earth to slowly start disappearing which will result in the Sun burning the planet very soon if we don't somehow get it spinning again. The government has put General Purcell (Richard Jenkins) in charge of finding the right minds to come up with a solution and he starts by recruiting a college teacher named Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and a physicist called Serge (Tcheky Karyo). Also in the group is the author Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) who knows a former colleague Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) who has created a giant laser that can cut through rock like butter. Brazzelton suggests a missile like ship that will bore through the Earth and into the core where a series of nuclear bombs will create a big enough ripple effect to get the core spinning again. They need someone to steer it and they get Beck (Hilary Swank) and Commander Richard Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) who are both shuttle pilots. The government also needs the best computer nerd to hack into and overtake the Internet for various reasons (!) and they get Rat (DJ Qualls). The crew boards the ship and they head for the Earth's core through the ocean bottom and they start their journey.*****SPOILER ALERT*****They continue to bore to the core but they get stuck at one point by crystals and have to hurry because of underground lava but Commander Iverson is killed just before they take off. Now Beck is steering the ship but when they refigure their data it appears that they don't have the right amount of nuclear bombs for the effect they need so mission control decides to go to plan ""B"" which means they have to turn around. But the crew votes and then decide to continue on! This film was directed by Jon Amiel who is a good director and he does keep the action flowing at a good pace although this film does take about 2 hours and 15 minutes to view. The premise is just like those science fiction films of the fifties like ""The Day The Earth Caught Fire"" and ""When Worlds Collide"" but while those actually tried to tell an interesting sci-fi story this film is more concerned with entertainment and it reminds one of ""Armageddon"" to a great degree. Everything about the script is silly like the government needing a nerd like Rat. They don't have a computer expert at NASA that can help out? Or that Unobtainium metal they use for the ship. They need this indestructible metal to build the ship but what is the windshield made out of? How convenient to have a window to see through while you bore the Earths crust and it's 9000 degree's! And when a compartment is shutting someone has to run back and try and save something which will lock them in. It happens in every one of these films! I think the film goes the right path with just ignoring logic and just allowing the audience to come along for a fun ride. But why does Hollywood spend so much time and money on something so silly and illogical? How many interesting and story driven films could have been made with this budget? I can only speak for myself and say that I'm not entertained by a big budget mess like this.

It ain't about the 'science', it's about whether the director, the actors, the cinematographers and the SFX guys can put enough energy and polish into what they do to keep things entertaining and interesting. I'd say that the effort and polish that went into this movie lift make it a better movie than any brief description of the plot can cover.""The Core"" has been compared to ""Armageddeon"" with good reason, although one other reviewer was very astute in that it actually is much closer in feel to ""Fantastic Voyage"". But for my money, ""The Core"" is actually a superior effort and a more enjoyable movie. Let's face it, for all its success as a huge hit, ""Armageddeon"" was a hammy, overblown, overcooked Bruckheimer cliché-fest - every single scene, every shot, every bar of music, every line of dialog was delivered with the volume turned up to ""11"" and SCREAMED TO THE BACK ROW like Hamlet on crystal meth. In contrast, there are peaks and valleys to the script structure in ""The Core"" - there are quiet moments, contemplative moments, funny moments, and people actually talk like people instead of Olympic demigods. (Not counting Steve Buscemi's contributions to ""Armageddeon"").Don't get me wrong - Bruckheimer blockbusters have their place in the scheme of things, but so do more modest efforts like this one. I like the understated, relatively restrained performances here. I like Delroy Lindo playing against type as a engineering genius and recluse who is quite defensive about his ship. I like that Tucci's character is a pretty sly dig at/tribute to the late Carl Sagan. I like the little jokes and asides (such as calling the new metal composing the ship hull ""unobtainium""). I like the portrayals of the group dynamics inside the ship, especially as Lindo and Tucci get on each other's nerves, and as Swank's commander tries to warn her about her inability to make the hard choices. I like that Karyo's character can't deal with the enormity of saving billions, but hopes that he can be strong enough and smart enough to save three people (his wife and daughters). I like that in the last seconds before the nuke goes off in his face, Tucci's character realizes how silly he is being (reflexively dictating pompous, pretentious notes for his new ""Cosmos"" style science popularization seconds before his death) and roars with laughter at himself. Anyway, not a terribly original movie, or a perfect movie, but an enjoyable one, good for a 'sci fi themed' movie night in front of the TV, or a pleasant way to kill a few hours any other time.",The Core

In fact, it was quite enjoyable.Sure, there are plenty of dumb moments in it and the science is questionable, at best. But it is moderately entertaining and fun. There are some spoilers ahead.The silly, but amusing stuff:Journeying to the centre of the Earth is bad enough - but did they have to do it in something that reminded me of my Hornby train set from when I was a kid?Just how does a penniless scientist living in the desert make (let alone invent) a substance that would revolutionise modern life?Why did that scientist not immediately patent and sell his substance and make a fortune from it, which he could then use to fund his Earth ship?I'm sorry, but the ""Project Destiny stopped the Core spinning but it can't start it again"" line doesn't wash with me.The computer hacker. Yawn.No kissing at the end, despite the obvious attraction of the two characters for each other.However, despite the above, I enjoyed the film and was able to overlook the silliness. There was one thing, though, which had me gritting my teeth and shaking my head.The manual release mechanism for the pod separation. Nobody would design it that way, even if they were under a deadline to complete the project. It's the equivalent of designing a plane with the landing gear release lever on the outside! Or a car with the gear lever in the boot/trunk! Stupid, just plain stupid.Up until that point I was enjoying the movie.

51,screenman,Extremely Dull,4,5 October 2008,"Latterday 'science-fiction' fantasies like this make you realise just how good - especially for their time - similar movies were of 30, 40 or even 50 years ago. I hate to bang on about it, but a publisher did it to me. What ultimately matters - the core, if you will - of any scenario is STORY. And STORY is something that happens to people you care about. All the special-effects, CGI and pyrotechnics in the world won't help one jot if the characters fail to elicit your empathy.Just compare this twaddle with an oldie from 1959. 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth' contained the same preposterous hokum. In fact, it contained more. A great ocean, and carnivorous prehistoric animals (with nothing to eat) at the centre of the Earth! Utterly ridiculous. But it worked as an adventure because we cared about the characters. Non of them had to demonstrate their worth by sacrificing themselves in implausibly contrived heroics. They didn't need to; we knew they would if called upon. They just got on with the job of drawing us into their dilemma with them. And we happily went. Their budget was limited. Special effects were primitive. CGI hadn't even been dreamt of. Yet the imaginative use of location, mirror painting, lighting and lizard prosthetics kept their respective generation enthralled. I know; I was there.'The Core' had nothing new to offer. Despite some 45 years of technical wizardry to draw upon, effects were cheap as cheap could be. The CGI was paralysingly obvious. Its academic 'expert' was about as believable and authoritative as a second-rate primary school teacher. The militarists and politicians just so many faces for their parts. Any science came out of 'Screwball Weekly'. A piece of incinerated fruit as the clincher? Go to the back of the class. And so many new ideas all at once - just when they were needed; A crush-proof substance, a sonic/laser/bonkers boring device, a heatproof (and thermally shockproof) material, and a cooling system that defied understanding. No wonder the cast have permanent expressions of confusion and doubt. They probably wondered if their pay-cheques were equally fantastic.I think I saw just about every disaster/fantasy adventure movie ripped-off somewhere or other here. We heard a script that was hardly worth listening to, delivered with the sort of transparent disbelief that would hardly have stretched the expressive strings of the Tracy family. I think I saw Hilary Swank as the now-obligatory smart-ass female. One or two other faces seemed familiar. Nothing heavy enough to sink below the mantle. Most of them got killed-off in ways that were suitably clichéd.And that's it. Don't waste your time here. Watch an oldie like '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea', or 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth'.

Like it hurt me.But first, I need to hurt the puerile-minded fans of this schlock: Any ratiocinating fools who entreat those of us with a modicum of intelligence to ""sit back, relax and enjoy this entertainment"" do not realize that we who rail against bogus ""science"" in movies of this ilk, do so NOT because of bogus science per se, but because of the INCONSISTENT bogus science. We may not boast Geophysics degrees, nor do we aspire to atom-splitting scientific accuracy  we just want CONSISTENCY! Example 1: If your movie maintains that pigeons use the earth's electromagnetic field for ""long-distance navigation"", why show pigeons disoriented whilst tooling around the few hundred feet of Trafalgar Square? Example 2: If your movie cites Real Science to explain the impossibility of generating enough energy to start the planet's core re-spinning, why not establish that it takes that same impossible amount of energy to STOP the core in the first place? More on this later.This movie has less ""science"" in it than Star Wars  and Star Wars has NO science in it.Furthermore, note that ""implausible"" = fiction; ""impossible"" = fantasy. A laser disintegrating rock to nothingness: implausible. Humans sustaining diamond-crushing pressure in the earth's mantle - no matter WHAT they're wearing, let alone wafer-thin spacesuits: impossible. Throughout the film, Impossibility outweighing Implausibility means this is Science FANTASY, not Science ""Fiction"", so cease associating it with a once-legitimate term. When physics knowledge was at a groundling stage, scientifically-inept tales like ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" were acceptable, but these days, even the common rabble are well-versed in general physics, so it is INEXCUSABLE that knowledge be so denigrated, ignored and subjugated to the inadequacies of feeble-minded technicians with big budgets, who promulgate ANTI-knowledge with their idiotic product Movie opens with a guy who looks like Peter Gallagher sans Eyebrows dropping dead at a board meeting  so begins a series of events that establish that the earth's core has inexplicably stopped spinning, causing electromagnetic anomalies. So scientists must drill down and re-start the spin with The Universal Solvent  nukes.But the spin begins long before they take the plunge At a militia symposium, geophysicist Aaron Eckhart (your average ""biscuit-thrower"" college professor: disheveled hair, attire and lifestyle; upon arriving home, throws biscuit to dog which has no name  Hollywood stereotype created by Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon""), cites Physics 101, yet none of the generals seem to have even a sixth-grade education, as they stare dismayed at his demo of burning a peach with a spray-can, to illustrate  get this!  how the Sun would burn the earth were it to lose its electromagnetic covering. The stupidity meter could go no lower at that point. Movies of this ilk are constructed around one or two thrilling sequences upon which the burden of the storyline is draped uncomfortably  such a scene was the introduction to grotesquely gorgeous Hilary Swank, as her crew emergency-land Shuttle Endeavour in the LA Aqueduct. The movie's pitch was ALL ABOUT sonic-booming over Dodger Stadium and navigating through overpass bridges like technofied T-Birds from Grease. Magnificently-staged, the thrill meter hit climax  consequently, it was all downhill from there. Stanley Tucci's suavely turtle-necked character is simply to insult Carl Sagan. Ironic that we meet Tucci exiting his Einstein seminars, even whilst this movie flings caca in the face of Einstein's most rigorous theorem (E=mc squared).Tchéky Karyo, as Frenchman Serge, is the only likable character. Of the admittedly talented cast, his performance alone is so poignant that we're truly saddened to see him die. (His end was pre-ordained; he was, after all, French.)Let's play Meet The Stereotype: gorgeously grotesque D.J. Qualls as computer-hacker, Rat. Isn't his ""unlikely hero"" character one of those rootless, amoral beings who make our modern online lives unbearable with viruses and identity theft and their wholly unnecessary existence? The sooner they are eradicated, rather than pedestalled, the better.There's the Square-Jawed American Pilot (least-known of the principals  ergo, first to die); Delroy Lindo, Token Black Dude; That Guy from Six Feet Under and Alfre Woodward as the preposterously miscast Flight Director. One keeps expecting F. Murray Abraham in a movie this bad. (The actors did their best, but the blathering catastrophe of the script gave them no quarter.) Lindo constructs their drilling craft with a substance called Unobtainium (stop that laughing in back!), which, he tells us, converts heat and pressure to energy, so the deeper it gets, the stronger it gets.er, I think the misinformed ""scientist"" MEANT to say that energy in the form of heat and pressure is converted to MASS by the Unobtainium. (Remember that ""E=mc2"" thingy?) Was the ""science consultant"" a G.E.D.?  and more importantly, may I book some time to slap him uncontrollably?The SCRIPT was made of Unobtainium. The deeper it got, the more energy it expended in keeping us from frying in outrage.In an Act II sequence, where everyone takes turns saying something scientifically illiterate, Tucci reveals that a man-made device, ""Destiny"", is responsible for the stalled core. I'll say this once: NOTHING MAN-MADE can output the amount of energy needed to stall a PLANET'S core. What part of ""NOTHING MAN-MADE"" don't the film-makers understand? Arrogant, anthropocentric, bacterial mites! Conceited humans refuse to acknowledge One True Fact: THE PLANET will be fine  whether or not the core spins at all; *whether or not humans EXIST at all*.

By the second half, the government has put together a crack team of scientists and others to travel to the earth's core and jump-start it with a nuclear device. You may safely skip the second half.

So watching THE CORE, without noise level at 11 or without epileptic editing, was quite a chore to sit through. Boring. Badly shot. A slew of good actors totally wasted. Really bad special effects.

Totally unbelievable, it still succeeds in boggling the mind with its sheer audacity of a fantastic journey to the molten center of the Earth.Scientifically, there are *so* many things wrong with this. The climatic effects of a lost planetary magnetic field would be nowhere near as dramatic as they claim here (they torch a peach to demonstrate what will happen to the Earth!). There would be a rise in UV radiation and a few other hazards, but it wouldn't wipe out all life, not even close, nor make the oceans boil.And the way they steer a vessel into the molten core is also just ridiculous. They might as well have gone into the sun. And the way they restore the rotation of the Earth's core is equally suspect. And then they suddenly discover that the vessel's ""unobtainium"" hull can be used to power it - well, if that were the case, why did it ever need a nuclear reactor to fuel it?! And the Destiny Project; how the hell did *that* work?! There are so many gaping plot holes. Yet, despite this it is still a fun movie.I grade it a 7 out of 10, because it IS an entertaining romp, but it could easily have been much more so. It's too bad they tried to play it straight, as if the science was anywhere near halfway acceptable. Many of the actors - esp. Hilary Swank - were far too serious for the material. Instead, there should have been swaggering, cussing, cardboard heroes with plenty of self-irony. This could have been a great, modern-day Flash Gordon style romp. Stanley Tucci's devious, self-centered Dr. Zimsky was right on target; the rest of the movie-making crew and cast would have done well to take some cues from him.Or, they should have set the movie 50 or 100 years in the future.

Supposedly the 'other side' made one of these, so we made a better one.

THE CORE once again aids the most brilliant minds of the planet to save the world from an untimely doom: The core of the Earth has (apparently) stopped turning, and everything from the very silliest of ideas that the writers of the movie can think about. THE CORE comes from the same kind as the movie Armageddon, which was about the world's collision with a deadly meteor. THE CORE is just about as silly, if not sillier, but its also amusing if seen in the ""so-bad-it's-good"" factor. Instead of the crew of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, the crew in this movie is composed of a brilliant science professor (Aaron Eckhart), ""terranauts"" Maj. ""Beck"" Childs (Hillary Swank) and Commander Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), a brilliant scientist (Stanley Tucci) and a crafty one (Delroy Lindo, surprisingly wacky). Their mission is to dig, via giant ""Mole"", and try to ""restart"" the core (somehow they have to!), while the world above goes up in flames (a lightning storm destroys the Roman Colosseum, a flock of pigeons go berserk and there's something about a couple of guys collapsing suddenly).The plot of the film, although is filled with modern technology and gadgetry, is simply a retread or rehash of those B-grade sci-fi abominations usually produced by Roger Corman. THE CORE will give Corman a run for his money with this film. It's a silly sci-fi adventure, with science that only could happen inside a mind of a crackpot. I'm not much of a scientist myself, but could you believe this! This film has so many crazy ideas, you'd wish they made this into a comedy. But it is what it is; an outrageous (both intentionally and unintentionally), and for most of the time, it doesn't really take itself seriously. The effects are uneven, ranging from good to occasionally terrible. The dialog, of course, is silly as is the whole crackpot story. Suspend your disbelief to the fullest and THE CORE is a real hoot, to be sure.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",The Core

Basically, it's Armageddon under the Earth. And, I didn't care for Armageddon either(see review). The plot concerns the deteriorating electromagnetic field of Earth. The special effects are not that special, and very little of the effects indicated that we were inside the Earth instead of on a computer drawing board for CGI. The best effects were in the beginning when we saw echos of The Birds. The script was one dimensional in that it focused entirely on the problem solving at hand, but almost never the characters' lives or relationships. Why not have cardboard cutouts of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck along for the ride? There were some bits of humor, but not enough. Other than one brief disagreement between the characters, there weren't any conflicts either. The obligatory one by one heroic deaths of characters for the good of mankind is a little too much at times also, sinking to acknowledged movie cliché level instead of being more humanly realistic.

A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road. You have your 4 standard horseman of the earth disaster; nuclear war, space invaders, plagues (esp. those that create zombies), and meteors. Lately earth killing movies have gotten creative and lets face it stupid, global warming (The Day after Tomorrow), President George W Bush (Fahrenheit 911) and now The Core with it's well I'm still not sure what broke. The core of the earth stopped spinning (not the earth itself mind you) which is causing the electromagnetic field to dissipate. Okay, that sounds serious. So that would cause what exactly? Apparently the movie wasn't all that sure so we get scenes of some the lamest and implausible disasters ever. Lets put two under the scientific microphone shall we.One involves birds going all Hitchcock in London due to their inability to navigate using the magnetic field. Okay that may effect the birds ability to fly south (Oh my god the pigeons they're going east!), but even the Mr. Magoo of the avian world wouldn't start flying into statues and buses.In another all too short montage a lightning storm destroys the Roman Coliseum. I'm not sure what is more unlikely, lighting striking relatively short rock structures, or the granite exploding when it does. Lightning, last time I checked, was attracted to metal. But what would you expect from a movie that puts a giant windshield in a rock-drilling machine (Made with that magic metal Unobtainium). Keep in mind I've only scratched the surface of the silliness. Acting wise Stanley Tucci is a joy, Hillary Swank still kind of looks like a guy, and everyone else is forgettable. The Core is enjoyable in that bad 50's sci-fi kind of way.

First an EMP wave sweeps through Boston, then birds go nuts in London, and soon entire cities are leveled. Of course, the only solution is to confide in a group of experts with assorted talents to jump start the Earth.Naturally in a science fiction adventure like this the first thing that gets annihilated is the city of Logicopolis. The Earth is so massive and has so many processes that even the most brilliant scientists can't predict 100% so a disaster that ""shuts down"" the whole Earth just cannot be logical. However, that doesn't make the movie any less fun. This is just a dose of classic Verne-style science fiction. There's action, there's adventure, there's a certain sense of wonder, though the by the end plot (as in many movies) brings up the idea of super-weapons, even a trailer hinted at this. While this ""explanation"" is not wholly bad, the whole ""super-weapons"" idea seems like too much of a cop out. This is science fiction, it doesn't need a total explanation.

'The Core' has, well, none of the above really. I didn't find the two main heroes as sympathetic as they should be (especially Swank, who can do better), the effects are so-so but what really bugs me is the ending. After watching almost 2 hours (man this movie is too long) we see some unclear explosions on a computer screen, the controll-room-happy-and-cheering crap, and then the completely useless ocean bit (with the whales, - nature - saving them... yuk!).

Overall a very good cast to go with the movie too with Eckhart, Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, Richard Jenkins, DJ Qualls and Bruce Greenwood.It's not a movie that's going to win a Best Picture by any means but at the same time it isn't a movie that's going to be nominated for a Razzie either, like most of Michael Bay's filmography has been.",The Core

It may not have great development in characters and plot, and it may not be the easiest to understand, but if fun is what you look for in movies, fun is what you'll get from this movie.Aaron Eckhart is Josh Keyes, a science teacher who is teaching his college students some of the same stuff we're talking about in eighth grade earth science. He gets called in to investigate odd deaths that occurred. Meanwhile, Rebecca `Beck' Childs (Hilary Swank) safely lands the space shuttle Endeavor after going more than 150 miles off target. They are both to help restart the earth's core spinning, since that is what caused the deaths and the shuttle to go off target, since it's destroying technology.Along with Josh and Beck, Dr. Brazleton (Delroy Lindo), who created the device that they are going into the earth with, and Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), a famous scientist, are going into the earth to trigger a nuclear device that will get the core to spin. Believe me, if you think this immediate plot is inconceivable, than you're in for two hours plus of things that don't make sense.To make a successful movie, you need many elements, but the major one is to keep the audience enthralled with whatever is on screen, whether it be a comedy, drama, horror, or an action movie. I was enjoying myself during the overlong runtime of The Core. I was entertained, which I feel is more important than convincing acting, a great script or plot, or perfect music cues.

And, during while the crew was in the crust, you could see the studio where it was being shot out of the window, not to mention other continuity errors, like the spelling of the secret project.

I'm glad to see he's still acting but he should be utilized more in prominent films.The first part of the movie is rushed and the second part is just a series of one ridiculous near miss after the next. The CGI isn't great. There just isn't anything to get interested in because the plot is so ridiculous. They are asking us to get invested in the stupidest storyline.Sometimes films like this have potential to be fun rides but this one is just an eye roller.

In this movie the disaster is the Earth's magnetic field that destables after the Earth's core stops spinning, and the heroes are the ones that travel to the Earth's core to kick start it. All the rest is various local disasters happening (some of them shown very nicely), people sweating to get the job done, and nothing more.In short, it's scientifically wrong.

If the laugh-along script and story don't amuse then trying to answer questions such as: why exactly did the U.S. government hire an obviously disturbed hacker and give him control over the internet, if the mission depends on the actions of the weapons specialist, why send just 1 of those but 2 geology professors, and why can't you smoke on a common commercial aircraft but smoking on a highly experimental nuclear-powered craft on which the fate of the world lies is OK?

Your just supposed to sit back and relax. I did try doing that and it still wasn't very enjoyable for me. The film starts off nice but by the middle it starts getting too stupid even by my low standards. The cast is talented, too bad they don't show it in this film. Hilary Swank is a great actress yet she couldn't even save this film. DJ Qualls, Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood and Glenn Morshower are all good actors yet they all together could not save The Core. The worst actor in the film is Aaron Eckhart and I find it odd that he gets work in Hollywood. Jon Amiel directs and he does a poor job of doing so. The only thing this film had that was above average was the special effects. Everything else about this film was pretty bad. The acting was bad and the dialog was pretty lame as well. The direction was bad and there was very little character development. Some of these things don't really matter in this type of film but it becomes more noticeable when you don't find the movie entertaining. The science isn't realistic though that's a given. The Core runs for a very long 135 minutes and it feels longer then that. Sometimes the film is unintentionally funny and that's always a bad sign. Some of the destruction scenes were okay but they were no where as good as The Day After Tomorrow and other disaster films. In the end, The Core is a pretty bad film and it fails to entertain.

92,Quicksand,Worth a Dollar if You Have Two Hours to Kill,6,15 January 2005,"How can you tell when a director is bad? I mean, assuming the director is given $50 million or so, competent actors, and a halfway-decent script, what would the film look like if he/she REALLY didn't know what he/she was doing? I think that film would look a lot like ""The Core.""From the preview stage, this movie was on my ""might see it but not pay for it"" list, so I just now caught it on cable. Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart will definitely have Oscars someday, and most of the other actors who make it on the ship are of similar caliber. The comic relief generally works (""I'm going to need Xena tapes and lots of Hot Pockets""), and the plot is no more ridiculous than, say, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (though it is slightly LESS ridiculous-- at least this movie attempts to offer a cause for the problem, however unlikely).I remember watching ""Entrapment,"" another John Amiel film, and thinking it was, in a word, awful. The editing was off, the plot lumbered ahead only through the will of Sean Connery's accent and Catherine Zeta-Jones spandex-clad anatomy. Watching ""The Core,"" Amiel has decided his mistake was pacing, and turns up the volume to eleven and full speed ahead, hoping the charisma of his actors covers his butt. In the second half of the film, this works fine. In the first half, it just shows his limitations as a director... poor special effects during the space shuttle landing that could easily have been fixed with model work or different camera angles; birds going crazy and smacking into buildings look exactly like someone tossed a dummy against a building, then the editor cut it as close as possible. Truly, this is a man at the helm who doesn't know what a good film is supposed to look like. I wonder what an Ed Wood movie would have looked like, if someone had given THAT guy $50 million?Characters die with clockwork predictability, and my only problem with the resolution was the actors were TOO good. They play geniuses, the absolute best in their fields, so when the movie ends I wanted to spend more time with them, see what incredible problems, discoveries, adventures they had next. The movie itself is barely a D+, thanks to the actors, occasionally adequate special effects (which we will call simply ""effects""), and a really great score to hold it all together. I'd buy the score (not the pop songs over the credits) before I'd watch the movie again, but it's a thumbs up effort for everyone who isn't Amiel.

It starts off with a Hitchcockian excursion of the camera, pulling in ""The Birds"" and extractions from the ""X Files"". However, among its many problems, the farther into the narrative we go, the more constrained the vision becomes -- constrained by unimaginative techno-geekery and special effects units. What they should have done is kept a tight visual focus a la ""Das Boot""; some good old-fashioned rivet-popping would have leveraged a feeling...this has no center, so they can only try to make us gasp at the twists and turns.And the evident hypocrisy: the subject matter of the story involves great risk; the way the movie is made and the choice of predecessors it derives from involve no risk at all.

It's a geophysicist's wet dream that only a fine ensemble cast could rescue from absurdity, and director Jon Amiel (Entrapment, Copycat) draws excellent work (and plenty of humorous interplay) from Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, and a host of memorable supporting players, especially The New Guy's D.J.

98,ilovedolby,A likable film that actually had me cracking up more than shivering with fear.,7,29 March 2003,"Hollywood has always had an infatuation with films that deal with natural disasters. However, the portrayal of such disasters is usually far over-blown for the sake of dramatic effect. But these films can't be taken seriously, as their purpose is nothing more than to give their audience an exciting, wild ride. This was the case in `The Core,' the new film from director Jon Amiel whose last film was 1999s `Entrapment,' which starred Sean Connery and Catherin Zeta-Jones. At first glance, `The Core' appears to be a science fiction/disaster flick about the end of the world. However, after analyzing the film, it's safe to say that this film is about 25% science fiction, and about 75% absurdity. But don't let that stop you from seeing it. Despite its silly story, `The Core' is a likable film that actually had me cracking up more than shivering with fear.The film opens with various minor catastrophes occurring worldwide, from 32 sudden deaths in a major American city to flocks of birds flying into crowds of people and buildings (an apparent rip-off of Hitchcock's, `The Birds'). Scientists are brought in to examine these occurances and they hypothesize that the core of the earth has stopped spinning. They now need to find a way to get the core rotating once again in order to stop the cataclismic events from taking place. With the help of world's best scientists, they create a ship, properly titled as `Virgil,' designed to travel to the center of the earth, dump off a nuclear payload of about four bombs, and then as Aaron Eckhart's character, Josh says, `then we outrun the biggest shock wave in history.' `The Core' has some great talent. Eckhart (`Erin Brockovich') and Tcheky Karyo (`The Patriot') portray professors brought on to study the devastation of the super storms and strange deaths that are happening. Stanley Tucci (`Road To Perdition') plays a famed scientist with a severe ego problem. Hilary Swank, the Oscar winning actress of `Boys Don't Cry' plays a NASA astronaut sent to maneuver the ship through the earth's interior, along with Bruce Greenwood of `Double Jeopardy.' Richard Jenkins, who has appeared in several Farrelly brother's films including `There's Something About Mary,' and `Me, Myself, and Irene' appears as a general in charge of the mission.Perhaps the film's most humorous points transpire when DJ Qualls (`The New Guy') enters the film has a hacker recruited to keep the media out of the public's eye by hacking the Internet and rooting out those who know of this secret mission to save the planet. If word of the events did get out, naturally as in any disaster flick, the fear of rioting and social unrest could take place. `The Core' is filled with clichés. It's easy to sit there and point out scenes that have taken place in other films, especially `Deep Impact,' and `Armageddon.' However, I found it to be forgivable. I liked `The Core' and found it to be fun escapism, not to be taken to heart. Disaster films have always been ridiculous, especially the greatest disaster schlock film of all, `Earthquake,' which starred Charlton Heston and George Kennedy. In recent years though, the idea of Earth's destruction from a force that mankind has no hold over has grabbed both the film industry and the public's attention, most notably with `Armageddon.' Quite frankly, I don't see why so many people loved `Armageddon' what with its stupidity, exaggerated direction from Michael Bay (`Pearl Harbor') and its dumbfounded performances from Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis. `Deep Impact' was a far superior film that was a box-office success in its time, but wasn't remembered because of mass appeal of `Armageddon.' Nonetheless, `The Core' is a decent flick that the average person can check his or her brain at the door of the theater with and veg-out to. ***",The Core

According to some, the lack of scientific accuracy could have been even worse, and what little there is had to be fought for... IMHO they should have played it for laughs, or set it in a parallel dimension (where different rules apply) or something. As it is, they appear to take it (and themselves) all too seriously.

It actually made me laugh and think about how these people are Hollywood actors who don't know any more about the earth's geology than any guy you might meet at a bar on a Saturday night.What really, REALLY ruins this movie is the fact that one of the scientists is the most obnoxious a**hole I've ever seen portrayed on the screen. He goes into an absolute rant that the female scientist shut off a section of the ship after it was damaged (in order to save the crew and the rest of the ship), meaning that they couldn't save a guy who was trapped back there. He thrusts a picture of the guy's wife and kids in front of the woman's face, and generally acts like he's going to pee himself. Not one minute later, this same self-righteous prick is going on another pants-wetting rant about how some other scientist is even worse than the woman, accompanied by a bunch of technical gibberish that would make a high school dropout chuckle at the stupidity of it. I'm sorry, I just had to change the channel at that point. I've seen more level-headed people on the Jerry Springer show.The special effects were fairly good and there were some entertaining situations, but this central character was absolutely unbearable.

The destructive scenes are minimal, with most of the lengthy action subsurface sequences featuring a multitude of overused and dull CGI. Aaron Eckhart sports one of the worst hairstyles (or toupees) ever, a fake, bleached, out-of-date, floppy crown. His blossoming romance with a cosmonaut (Hilary Swank) is predictable. In fact, out of the 6, guess which two make it back alive? Hilary is ill-suited to this role, more like a college sorority student, then experienced engineer - rank Swank.

All in all I find it a well made and entertaining film. Special effects are indeed somewhat pedestrian but it is not a high budget major film. Hillary Swank does a good job as tomboy action heroine and one cannot help but feeling pleasantly reminded of The Fantastic Voyage or other classics. The Core will most certainly not be Jon Amiel's lasting legacy in film but if you want an entertaining 90 minutes of pure popcorn cinema this will do very nicely.

Nothing really stands out in the film, not even the special effects, which you would expect from a movie like this. So, if you have to kill time, then by all means see this film, but if you are looking for a disaster flick, this should be nowhere near your first choice.

The script tries to anchor itself in some kind of real science, which of course ends up being the same old fantasy as always. It's also fun to identify who's going to make it and who's not. Although, if you've ever seen a film before it's not that hard.Plotwise, it relies on the all too familiar setup: ""We have to _____ in order to _____. But that's impossible. Wait, what if we ______? Yeah, that could work!"" The core repeats this conversation several times and isn't afraid to go all the distance with it either. Like when they need a means of transportation to drill down to the earth's core, and they just happen to know a guy (alone in the middle of the desert) who happen to have developed a way of drilling and a material (logically called ""unobtainium"") that's virtually indestructible.The actors are of the well respected (and presumably rather cheap) kind.

115,bcolquho,A Journey To The Center Of The Earth was never like this,10,7 January 2005,"What do you get when you cross two classic science fiction movies? The question's no joke. What do you get when cross The Day The Earth Stood Still, (1951), with A Journey To The Center Of The Earth, (1959)? Answer: The Core. A Journey To The Center Of The Earth was never like this. In that 1959 classic, James Mason led a group of explorers into the center of the Earth. The popular theory back in the 1800s was one in which Earth was hollow. Now for the other comparison. In 1951's The Day The Earth Stood Still, Michael Rennie was an alien from a peaceful planet, who'd come to Earth to warn us about our nuclear testing. Since this was during the darkest hours of the Cold War, the Army freaked out and shot him. Killing him temporarily. He was revived by his robot. Makes you wonder where Andromeda got the idea to revive Trance after she was ""killed."" Doesn't it? Back on point. To prove he's an alien, and convince the people of Earth to give up war, he makes Earth stand still for a day. What does this have to do with The Core? You ask? EVERYTHING! The movie begins with Earth standing still. People die unexpectedly, birds die unexpectedly, the space shuttle is forced to crash land in the Los Angeles River. Coincidently, this movie came out the same week as the Columbia explosion. The same thing happened in 1986 with the movie Space Camp. Hilary Swank is the pilot of the Endeavor which is in orbit when it happens. When the Endeavor begins its re-entry, it goes wildly off course. She has to compensate, or in this case, overcompensate, for it. She's brought before a review board and grounded. At the University of Chicago, a professor geophysics is in classroom, teaching his students, when the FBI comes for him. He's brought to Washington where he meets Serge, a French physicist who's an expert in atomic bombs, and an Air Force general. The Air Force general tells them what happened, and about the unexplained deaths. The geophysics professor and his students had modeled the entire planet. There's a scene reminiscent of the 1963 movie The Birds, in which the pigeons of Trafalgar Square attack the London tourists. Armed with his information, he tries to convince TPTB that ""The end of the world is nigh!"" Nobody, not even the President's science adviser, played by Bruce Greenwood, wants to listen to him. When he finally convinces Bruce Greenwood to listen to him, it's almost too late. They go to see Delroy Lindo, who's invented a high-tech earth borer. Delroy Lindo and Bruce Greenwood have serious issues. Delroy Lindo accuses Bruce Greenwood of stealing his idea for the machine. Bruce Greenwood gives Delroy Lindo a deadline. What is it? You ask? Three months. Says I! It's built in the required amount of time. The ship, christened Virgil, is prepared for launch. Rebecca, (Hilar Swank,) is told by her commander, Bob Iverson, that she doesn't know how to lead because she wants to win. It's only when she has to lose that she'll be a commander. Things start to go awry right from the get-go. Right after Virgil's launch, they meet up with whales, and they're singing to them. Then their speed increases. On the surface, the Air Force general and the capcom, maintain contact. The CapCom, call sign Stick, tells them that they're going too fast and to slow down. Rebecca says that it's too late. They're already committed. When they hit the mantle, and punch through it with their lasers, they're inside an enormous geode. They didn't know that, So what happens? Virgil gets stuck. To continue on their mission to Earth's core, they have to get unstuck and back on their way. Which they do, with the loss of Bob Iverson. They then run into diamonds. As they prepare to arm the bombs and jettison them, a diamond hits the compartment they're in. To prevent a damaged compartment from compromising the integrity of the ship, the damaged compartments were designed to be jettisoned. Serge dies collecting diamonds. The physics professor and the President's scientific adviser are among the survivors. So are Rebecca and the builder of Virgil. Then just as they reach the core, they find it to be bigger than they'd expected and their supply of bombs too limited to do the job. The physics professor has an idea. He proposes that they take the remaining bombs and put them in the undamaged compartments. Unfortunately, someone has to manually jettison the compartments. Virgil's builder volunteers for the suicide mission. The physics professor and the scientific adviser go to the last undamaged compartment with the remaining bombs. The ship lurches and the bomb traps them. It lurches again and frees the physics professor. The Air Force general had ordered them home because he wanted to use DESTINY to restart the core. He was overruled. As the last compartment's jettisoned, the physics professor and Rebecca are the only ones left. Rat, the computer hacker, had hacked into DESTINY and shut it down. Before Earth's rotation's restarted, microwaves destroy both the Coliseum and the Golden Bridge. Meanwhile, Virgil's lying dead at the Earth's core. The physics professor has another bright idea. He asks Rebecca if she has enough power to get them out before the bombs explode. They ride the pressure waves back to the surface. Are they rescued? What's the physics professor's next bright idea?

Nothing else is good in this movie, except the end credits, finally letting me know that my suffering has come to an end. I won't recommend this movie to anyone, although I know there are people out there that like this movie. So there you have it, that is my verdict of this movie. It sucks, plain and simple. The story is so full of plot holes that it should be a cheese, and the ""actors"" doesn't do anything to help make this movie suck any less. I rate this movie 1/10",The Core
118,Vincent_B,The Core is the Size of Mars!,4,9 January 2014,"This movie is about many impossible things. Things like building a bullet train to Hell. Hacking the internet with a virus or whistling in a cell phone with a gum wrapper to give you unlimited minutes. Successfully landing the space shuttle in a LA reservoir qualifies your team to pilot the bullet train to Hell. It should have been named ""Mission Impossible"" but that was taken.The story really is least of this movie bad points. The acting degrades as the story progresses. Bad sciences, poor acting, lousy character development, makes the movie stink on many levels. I will be kind and generous giving the movie a 4 out of 10.

The movie, however, was ok to watch. (I've seen worse, much, much worse.)

One would figure that this would make it far superior since they could learn from the priors' mistakes but no, it just made it that much worse. The worst part of this film is that it was riddled with every cliché known to our civilization today. I don't want to get started on plot holes because that'd take forever and I wouldn't even know where to begin...however most of them were obvious anyway. The acting was decent, I'll give it that. I was actually thinking along the way that my hat goes off to these people since I wouldn't be able to concentrate like they did with such a bad script. I'd honestly burst out laughing if I had to say some of the crappy dialog; but they did it. The death sequences were terrible, not only in how they happened but how the other crew members reacted afterward. The whole concept of the story is a little far-fetched to begin with but the hacker character, members of the military, and a few of the scientists only exacerbate matters!Final Drill:Movies: This had to have bombed!DVD Purchase: Not one copy should've sold!Rental: Don't waste your time.",The Core

It wasn't all that bad of a film.The premise was interesting however, albeit not entirely original, it did have it's own spin. The characters were a motley crew if nothing else. Like going to a family reunion where all the people in the world who would not normally get together, and normally shouldn't get together do.Really the simplest review would be to say that it is a disaster movie. Man must survive, while over coming impossible odds, and spouting off philosophical warm fuzzies.Everything goes swimmingly, until the unforeseen variable changes the plan, and man must not quit but instead sacrifice himself in order for the species to survive.In the end, it really is hard to find something bad about this movie.

124,Jordan_Haelend,Okay for a comedy.,3,2 December 2003,"This is a pretty good comedy, chiefly because the ""hard science"" in this flick contains so many mistakes that you can't help but laugh at it. Can lasers work underwater? They can't even work through rain! Can people in flimsy suits walk around in superheat, at 800,000 PSI? Can communications signals actually work through MILES of rock? Would it really be possible for a hacker to have done the stunts Rat does? Would air in a tank actually escape with a hissing noise when the exterior pressure is so high as to make such a thing physically impossible?As to the characters, they consist of every stereotype from such movies that you can imagine. Hunky scientist, brilliant female pilot, egotistical mad scientist, scrawny computer hacker (although I think the filmmakers did us a favor by NOT giving us a stereotyped preppy nerd- we get a physically hideous grunger instead.) And so on and so on.The only actor I really liked was Stanley Tucci. He's been one of my favorites since I saw him in the HBO film ""Conspiracy."" He turns up the acting full blast in an attempt to inject some excitement into the proceedings. Thank you, Mr. Tucci- at least YOU were looking out for us.The others were bland or pointless, while Rat is one of the ugliest, most unlikeable characters I've ever seen in a film.One of the writers, John Rogers, complained about someone attacking his film after the individual saw it at a pre-release screening; Rogers claims that it took him three years to get it made, which would certainly explain the fact that by the time of its release the market for this kind of disaster film had already dried up.",The Core
125,mrskywalker,Good Movie,10,6 April 2003,This is a good action science fiction film.  Of course who would expect so called realism in a film like this or Time Machine or Planet of the Apes. If you are looking for slow motion vomiting or anything like that which people now call realism it is not really here. The film calls for some imagination by the audience and dimwits who have no imagination might laugh or not like this film.  The only part I did not like is the kind attitude it had toward anything government or army which is disconcerting when the army seems like such a positive thing right now on the war coverage. Also criticism of army etc. is so old and tired in movies and common.But the film is still good although pretty grim at moments.  It reminds me of Dantes Peak movie a few years ago.  I also saw this film the same day as Tears in the Sun which is one of the great films of all time so that made this one seem not as good.  But it is still worth a look.,The Core
126,mickdansforth,One of My All-Time Favorites,10,13 July 2004,"Upon the third time watching this movie, it has now become one of my all time favorites. I love the characters. I love the disaster effects. I love the trout bouncing off the window.When I first saw the movie in the theater on my birthday, I wasn't very excited. How good could a Journey to the Center of the Earth movie be with out monsters. But I was quite impressed with it. And it only gets better every time I watch it. The characters really drive this story. Delroy Lindo's Braz is great and seems so different from other Lindo characters. Tucci's Zimsky hits the mark well. Maniacal and devious yet worlds away from his character in Murder One. I can never get enough Tchéky Karyo, and here he plays another great character. I've been a big Bruce Greenwood fan ever since Nowhere Man, and it great to see him playing a heroic character. Having seen this, I now have to check out more Aaron Eckhart movies. Hilary Swank seems like a very odd choice for a leading lady in a summer popcorn movie, but after the movie my girlfriend complained about Swank being a skinny pretty girl like all Hollywood movies, so apparently she can pull this kind of role off too.The disaster effects above ground are spot on. The underground ones were different than I imagined but work well, and better than the 70's/80's psychedelic light tunnels used on just about every movie for those decades where travel happened else-wise. The DVD has great extras, but I'm hoping for another release. 10th Anniversary. Something. I just want to spend more money and get more stuff. Maybe some cheap direct to video sequels or a cartoon.

128,matlefebvre20,"When the Earth stood still, they made ""The Core""",5,26 April 2006,"If the starting idea was to sent somebody inside the Earth's core, why did nobody think about making a movie based on the famed book ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" from Jules Verne? The only movie that has been released about this novel was a Disney family-oriented film with too many changes to the original story to be considered as valuable material.Instead, it has been decided that the concept of traveling to the core should be turned into a disaster movie. There's nothing wrong so far... But as professor Joshua Keyes says in that same movie: ""After that it gets bad"".""The Core"" is one of the cheesiest disaster movies ever released, and that for many reasons. There are interesting moments in the movie, but the final result could be compared as a recipe involving both caviar and Kraft dinner.The most striking (and pitiful) aspect of the movie is the patchwork and corny dialog, which turn potential-full actors into walking parodies. You can easily see that lines are artificial and insane, which can only lead the viewer to laugh of the characters. There are countless examples of this, but some are unforgettable. The best (it means the worst) of the lot is the following one. General Percell (Richard Jenkins) asks Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo) how much would it cost to build his massive ship within three months. Brazzleton laughs and says it would cost fifty billion dollars. Percell answers by saying: ""Will you take a check?"" Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) replies by uttering: ""Why don't you use a credit card? You get miles.""It's only a single example of what forms ""The Core"". I could give you a full list of this kind of quotes but I don't have time.Characters are very different. They're either entertaining or simply ridiculous. For the latter, just take General Percell. You could see that he's involved in the dialog that I put above. So when you watch and listen to such an important military man, it doesn't take Einstein's brain to find out that he's a clown.For the entertaining part, something attracted me in Rat (DJ Qualls). He is an ultra-weird, bizarre and slightly paranoid computer genius who's assigned to the information exchange for the mission. But his situation is special because he's like the fish-out-of-water. He's a geek living in his small, computer-laden apartment, and he's almost addicted to Xena videotapes and Hot Pockets. And he's put with some of the world's leading scientists in order to save the Earth. That's pretty funny. And Rat also delivers some of the most interesting quotes of the movie, such as: ""Your Kung-Fu is not strong"", and the following one with professor Conrad Zimsky. Rat asks Zimsky: ""How many languages do you speak?"" Zimsky answers: ""Five, actually."" Rat adds: ""I speak one. 1-0-1-0-0. With that I could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life.""Enough about the characters. Let's talk about the disasters themselves, because they're the core (allow me that wordplay) of the story. Because of the unique character of this movie, the catastrophes are unique, as well. We successively see 32 people instantly dying in Boston, which leads to a great mess. The most thrilling disaster is next. Massive hordes of birds go wild in London and create a chaos which reminisces ""The Birds"" from Hitchcock. There is also a static thunderstorm in Roma, with special effects which quality goes from low to high, and intense micro-wave radiation in San Francisco, another great moment.Generally, the disaster scenes are what makes this movie interesting in a sense. They're all thrilling in their own way and we must admit that it's a great deal of imagination. The only one that doesn't work is the Space Shuttle malfunction in Los Angeles.Actually, this movie is a very mixed bag. This is very hard to tell if it should be recommended. The disaster scenes definitely enthrall, but the screenplay and the lines are worth of a B-picture. So it's your choice. But you must accept the fact that watching this movie is turning your eyes on and your brain off and that it's a disaster movie at the same time that it's a self-parody.",The Core
129,xavrush89,"Way better than ""Armageddon"" -- a drama in sci-fi clothing.",9,1 January 2004,"I don't know what people who saw this were expecting, but I thought it delivered, and I just watched it along with someone else, didn't even select it myself.First of all, look at the cast list.  These are not people who normally appear in sci-fi films (although Alfre Woodard has), so you know it is not going to be your typical sci-fi fare.  It is character driven.  People who spend every scene overanaylzing what would actually possible and what would not are going to ruin it for themselves.  These are great characters. Hilary Swank does not disappoint, although she is very subtle in her acting, which I like.  (Stanley Tucci is not subtle.  I normally LOVE him, but he does to this movie what Billy Zane did to ""Titanic."")  But the really great characters are Delroy Lindo's workaholic scientist and D.J. Qualls' computer hacker.  Some of their comical moments that were cut from the film should have been left in.  Also, Woodard and qualls should have had more screen time together, because they exhibit an odd sort of untapped chemistry (no, not that kind).Anyway, enough about the cast.  The special effects are high quality and the inventions the filmmakers have, well, invented seem pretty real to me. This works as a sci-fi/fantasy as well as, if not better, than, many other possible-end-of-the-world themed films.  (It's more like ""Deep Impact"" than ""Armageddon"", thank goodness.)But here is what stayed with me:  the decisions faced by the crew members in this film.  That is what resonates, life-or-death situations played out. Most of the best of the genre (like ""Alien"") touch on this, this film brings it to the forefront.  It may be uncomfortable to watch, in fact, but so it should be.  That is what I feel elevates this film and makes it A LOT better than many critics said it was.

The entire crew piles into the ship and pilots this never-before-seen technology like they'd been doing it all their lives.Still, the whole mess somehow is kind of watchable and entertaining for some intentional and unintentional laughs.

The characters were obnoxiously superficial and cliché-loaded, i could perfectly understand the actors to not be interested in bringing their characters to life.But nothing can beat these ridiculous ideas! Stupid actions of the protagonists take turns with the movie presenting hilarious effects of mother earth going bonkers (mostly by ignoring all laws of physics).

135,mfisher452,This film is made of pure unobtainium,4,6 January 2005,"I don't know much about geology, but what little I do know suggests that the nature of the Earth's core is such as to be impervious to any merely human intervention, and that traveling to it is something human beings probably never will be able to do. Hence, any SF flick about humans doing one to rectify the other is likely to be as fanciful as The Wizard of Oz, so a big ""caveat emptor"" is attached to this movie. I figured that anyone audacious enough to cook up an eco-fable like this would have checked his science so as to make the movie more believable, but apparently I was wrong according to the legion of IMDb reviewers who have savaged this film.This film reminded me a bit of the 1966 film ""Fantastic Voyage,"" in which a group of scientists and their craft are shrunk to the size of a microbe and injected into the body of a scientist (or was it a diplomat?) who has been wounded in an assassination attempt, in a race against time to save his life. ""The Core"" resembles ""Fantastic Voyage"" in several ways: First, the technological premise that makes possible travel to this inaccessible realm is so far-fetched as to be more magical than scientific. Second, in all but a few places, the inside of the body is naturally quite dark, and so, one would think, is the interior of the Earth; but in both movies, these unseen realms are aglow with light. Third, the sex ratio is similar: Four men, one woman, who of course is played by Raquel Welch. Fourth, none of the characters rises much above stereotype, since the story is driven by situation, not characters. Fifth, come to think of it, Hilary Swank, while not as voluptuous as the young Raquel Welch (who could be?), does slightly resemble her. Sixth, the events of the film are kept secret from the public, and Edmund O'Brien's General Carter is very similar to General Purcell, who is played by that excellent and serviceable character actor Richard Jenkins. (Unfortunately, every time I saw Jenkins, I was distracted by memories of his hilarious performance as Walter Wingfield in ""Say It Isn't So."")

136,amiranda-39274,We Killed the Planet,7,23 August 2020,"The core is one of my childhood favorites, I remember watching this movie with my family in our Rv all the time when we would go on camping trips. As nostalgic as this movie is to me, i wont let that affect my critique of it. This movie is a dumb action/disaster movie but its fun movie none the less.The story: The world is ending (you know the usual) and the only way to save it is to somehow travel to the center of the earth and fix the core. The only way to do this is to use an experimental spaceship to travel through all the layers of the earth, and launch a couple of nukes to get the core running again, all within a urgent time frame. The beginning of the movie is very off-putting as we watch all sorts of bizarre occurrences, but as the movie gets to the voyage to the core, the movie gets better. If your looking for scientific realism here, your watching the wrong movie, this is pure science fiction. But the science fiction aspects of it are truly enjoyable. The montage of the construction of ""Virgil"" is very fascinating, especially the ultrasonic lasers that will allow the ship to tunnel to the core, and watching how a united worlds efforts could do to build such a ship in less than 3 months is also fascinating. We get to see the characters training and preparing for the voyage which does add some level of believability. And the voyage itself is truly compelling, as the crew travel through different layers, encountering all sort of dangers along the way. There are indeed a lot of contrived mistakes made to create drama, but I personally think that the reason why the crew made so many mistakes, was because of ill preparation, i mean they built the ship in less than 3 months, and they highlight with more time they could have been better prepared, so it makes sense that so many things could go wrong.The Effects: The special effects and CGI look horrendous, anytime there is a superstorm, or swarm of birds crashing into things, it looks awful, even seeing the ship travel to the core can look off-putting at times. But all of the practical effects look amazing, from the inside of Virgil which is just full of atmosphere to the chasm full of crystals, you feel that the crew has indeed travelled to the center of the earth, and not Jules Verne version. To be honest this is not much of a disaster film, instead it more of a Sci-Fi adventure, that entertains you more with the journey to the core then lets say seeing the world be destroyed, I mean you can just turn on your tv to see that in real life.The Characters: Despite the story being weak, and the special effects not helping, it is the characters that make this movie something special. The crew of the Virgil consist of 6 members, pilots Bob Iverson and Rebecca Childs, scientists Zimsky and Josh Keyes, weapons expert Serge, and the creator of the ship, Branz. All make a fantastic cast, that make you care about their goal to save the planet, and make you worry for their safety, not to mention feel sad when some of them die. And the side characters can also be enjoyable, such as Rat the hacker.This movie is not a masterpiece, but personally for me its shines with the cool sci fi aspect, the characters, and the shortage of time and dangers the crew face, its these things that make this movie very engaging. There will be a few moments that might take you out of the film or make you at least cringe, but then there will be another scene that brings you right back in to it. No this movie is not scientifically accurate, but i guarantee it is completely fun. For me this core posses heart.",The Core

This will ultimately cause the end of the world in about a year. This coming disaster needs to be stopped, so the government enlists the help of a college professor (Aaron Eckhart), a NASA pilot (Hilary Swank) a cocky scientist (Stanley Tucci) and finally a nutty scientist (Delroy Lindo) who has developed a metal that can withstand the intense pressure of the Earth's core, and he has the plans to build a ship out of it all he needs is $15 billion (or maybe it's $50 billion, I couldn't really tell), which the government gladly pays and thus the construction begins. Now I'm not much of a science wiz, but it seems pretty unlikely any type of scientist would be able to develop a metal that could withstand the intense pressure of the Earth's mantle and especially the core itself. But then again any disaster film has plenty of sizeable leaps in logic, which can provide some good, if somewhat cheap fun, (""Armageddon"" comes to mind).However, ""The Core""  is such an obvious and badly acted movie that any possible fun is washed away in the first 30 minutes, then the movie goes on for about another 2 hours, which just becomes a major exercise in patience after the first hour. Now onto the acting, Eckhart is laughable as Dr. Keyes, however it's not his fault, Swank is just stone-faced as Major Rebecca 'Beck' Childs, Lindo is just there as Dr. Edward Brazleton and Tucci chews up the scenery (if you want to call it that) as Dr. Conrad Zimsky. Of and there's also Tcheky Karyo (the French soldier from ""The Patriot"") and DJ Qualls (""The New Guy""). The special effects are pretty lousy, especially during the shuttle landing sequence in the first 20 minutes of the movie and the whole movie seems way overdone, while not accomplishing much at the same time.

It is extremely well made, well directed, edited, and acted. And the special effects are superb. If you like sci-fi, this movie will greatly satisfy, and the plot --with events fortunately not likely to occur--is filled with valid scientific bases. You can learn a bit about geo-physics and enjoy a ride to the center of the earth. The characters are drawn fairly well, with a lot of realism. I was very impressed with the entire production.",The Core

143,mpofarrell,"Dare I Say It? ""Rotten To The...",4,17 April 2003,"THE CORE is one of those big budget Science Fiction extravaganzas that is so bereft of excitement and imagination that it becomes an endurance test for the audience to sit through. No doubt the filmmakers had every intention of making this into a taut, edge-of-your -seat thriller ; the film's promising first half hour consists of two spectacular set pieces guaranteed to whet the viewer's appetite. The opening segment in Boston is a spectacular display of instant chaos, where the camera pans from an executive dropping dead in a skyscraper boardroom to the outside street where over a score of drivers and pedestrians are simultaneously stricken by some unknown phenomena. An even more impressive segment follows with what seems like thousands of pigeons haphazardly flying into buildings and windows or dropping dead in mid flight in downtown London. The cause? Apparently the earth's core has stopped spinning, which results in turbulent conditions on the planet's surface (earthquakes, tidal waves and intense electrical storms.) To the rescue come an eclectic assortment of scholarly and scientific types to save the world from imminent disaster. These characters are played by A-list actors in roles more suited for a cast in a B Movie. My only guess is that the likes of Hilary Swank (pretty, quick-thinking Astronaut) , Aaron Eckhart (hunky, disheveled Geophysicist professor) and Stanley Tucci (obnoxious , attention-seeking scientist) had time on their hands before their next big projects. Along with veteran players Alfre Woodard, Bruce Greenwood and Delroy Lindo, the entire cast gives it a game try but can't overcome the kind of pedestrian dialog that induces voluble wisecracks from theater audiences. Jules Verne did it much more effectively with his novel JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH (and the old Pat Boone movie is far more entertaining!) The actual journey to the earth's core in this new film is strictly standard stuff, punctuated by scenes of the crew being pinned under heavy equipment at the worst possible moments, a sure sign that the director and scenarist are desperate for ideas.Nondescript visual effects become visually monotonous very quickly ; granted, no one knows exactly what a journey like this would actually look like if it were even remotely possible, but a more fanciful imagination would have helped. Ironically, the only terror the movie produces in the audience is eerily unintentional.The film opens with a space shuttle in crisis just before landing. A later scene involving The Golden Gate Bridge invokes an unsettling feeling that has nothing to do with the suspense on screen. THE CORE is a product of miscalculation on several levels.",The Core

Also, if you can get past the plot flaws, the movie doesn't disrespect your intelligence like others of this type do. Also, no lame Hollywood romance plot (despite teases)!

152,c_p_c,ARMAGEDDON in Reverse!!! (minor spoilers),6,30 March 2003,"What would happen if the earth's core just one day decided to stop spinning? Well, THE CORE answers that questions.  Appeareantly people would die unexplainable deaths in synchronized unison, birds would lose all sense of direction, and gigantic waves of electric lightening would hover in the sky. Basically, everything as we know it would stop working.THE CORE is a B movie plot, not to mention the exact opposite of ARMAGEDDON. This time instead of flying out into space to land on an asteroid hurtling towards earth at 400,000mph, a crew of unlikely people travel to the center of the earth to jump start the core and save the world.  Ok, I can go with that!Of course this is not a a movie trying to scientifically explain what a trip like this would be like, but the movie is so far fetched that you would think they just took advantage of every possible extreme they could. Earth's core has just stopped spinning and what is the likelihood that someone has been working on a machine to travel at depths that deep.  Not likely, but ok they managed to do it in ARMAGEDDON, I will go with it!The real problem of this movie arises when the obvious does not play out. Characters come face to face with hot lava that in reality would sizzle through anything.  The team is comprised of a smart but simple college prof, a hoakey and greedy scientist who would not last a minute in a venture of this matter, and a Russian dude.  The only qualified person on this mission is the driver of the ship.  Come on NASA, would you really send this sort of crew to save the world.  Yet ARMAGEDDON's crew were not exactly astronauts of the year.Finally, the special effects are interesting but not all that great.  At least ARMAGEDDON had stimulating visual effects and that is what made the movie.  THE CORE does have some vivid city destruction scenes; however, they only take up about 10 minutes of this 2+hr movie.  I think we can all realize how this movie stole from ARMAGEDDON and if your still not convinced, you should know that all the characters draw straws to see who will stay behind and sacrifice their life for all the others; sound familiar?!?!To wrap up, THE CORE is nothing new, but if you can get past all the falibility and just watch the movie for what it is, it is a good experience and fun never the less.While it does not reach the quality of ARMAGEDDON, THE CORE is still a ride and thus rates 6/10.",The Core
153,DesertDogMedia,The Core,6,2 July 2014,"Title: The CoreDirected by: Jon Amiel Storyline: We see a guy in an office collapse along with tons more people outside, this whole reason is due to their pacemakers stopping. But I find it a coincidence that so many people have pacemakers in such a smaller area such as a fun fair. Or possibly there are just that many American's with pacemakers, I do not know. Also only older versions of pacemakers are effected by microwaves, modern versions are not. We're then introduced to Dr. Josh Keyes, who is teaching student about sound and how is travels through rock. He is interrupted by two FBI agents who want to talk to him but you don't find out straight away. We're then introduced to Serge who is friends with Dr Keyes, they are talking as they walk into the compound room with all of the bodies the military has collected. They are given some clues to what killed them by the military officer, Dr Keyes (Ok, I'm tired of writing out his formal name), Josh figures out that they all had pacemakers because Serge works in weapons and Josh works in electromagnetism. Josh hears about this and thinks of the worse so he gets his students to map out electromagnetic anomalies and also gives them a free pass go for their doctorate if they do so. Josh takes his notes to a famous scientist called Zimsky. He looks over the notes and realizes that he is right, but first passes his work off as wrong because his own work doesn't match it, but they find the northern light in LA and that is when the world realizes that something isn't right. Josh gets escorted to the pentagon by the FBI guys from before and has to explain along with Zimsky what is going on, so he does so by explaining the EM field and how the Earth's molten iron core works, they also find out that the EM field has stopped, so this is going to expose everyone to the sun's harsh radiation as the EM field normally filters this out.Josh gives details on why they can't get to the core, but Zimsky knows someone who has a machine which can by using laser technology. You will notice that later in the movie they use lasers to get down and dodge all the diamonds, but on the way back up they seemed to have displayed no further hazard. But they start working on plans to build this machine which can drill into the earth it is made of unobtainium and is an impossible feat of engineering. They plan to detonate 5 200 megaton nuclear bombs to get he core spinning again. They do not have enough bombs, just saying. They have to go out to cut the crystal out of the laser port, but they have let lava in which is slowly melting everything while they are trying to work. Serge incorrectly calls it lava, but it is actually magma as it is more thick and gooey. Lava is free running and liquid like whereas magma is thicker and more viscous. They are able to get the bombs in place while mot of the crew die. But the ship is still in the blast zone, but thankfully unobtainium can convert heat into energy so they are able to re-route the power and get out. But they are trapped at the bottom of the ocean, but they are then rescued by the navy as the whale song gives away their position.Acting: Dr Keyes is played by Aaron Eckhart, this man is a good actor and he continues to show that throughout this movie. The others are expendable characters, but they are well fleshed out expendable characters though. You can tell who is going to die and who will live. Noticeable Camera work: To show you the damage that is caused by people with pacemakers crashing the camera is one long panning crane shot, this is nice and creatively used to a good extent. Similar to the dolly shot for inside the office while following the business men. The camera angles for the shuttle landing are simple yet effective in getting the tense point across with their great framing. There are some instances of shaky cam, they don't last very long so I'll give them that. We also get a POV shot when they are trying to do the manual ejection. Graphics: We are thrown into the opening credits from the get go, these are actually not half bad for opening credits with nice CG to accompany it. The CGI of the birds was great, mainly as I couldn't tell it was CGI based on the quality of the pigeons. But sadly the space shuttle and Earth did look CGI, that is until the shuttle gets into the actual earth seen, it looks semi-realistic there. The CGI whales are the same as the CGI pigeons, very nicely done. CGI Magma nicely done too. Overall Feel: The science and engineering is bad, enough said. I have talked about it enough in the story. If you do not know a lot about science then this'll be just another action movie for you and it'll be a damn good action movie at that. everything else in this movie is great apart from the science of the story. Doesn't feel like two hours, mainly because the movie is good with how it paces itself. The CGI is good boarding on visually stunning for the time, mainly due to the artistic design of the core, for the most part that is. Along with the decent acting. The movie is predicable, but fun.

""Well, it's kind of like Armageddon, except it occurs at the middle of the earth, and it's also kind of like..."" Basically it borrows scenes from every disaster/action movie you'll ever see.I don't blame the actors. The cast is filled with decent talent for the most part. They didn't have much to work with given the cartoon-like script and paint-by-numbers storyline. This movie also completely misses the point of the ""science"" in sci-fi. In order for a sci-fi story to work, the science aspect has to at least seem somewhat plausible. Anyone who has ever studied anything about computers, physics, chemistry, or geology will find themselves laughing hysterically during this nonsense.Even the special effects are rather weak. It seems no one was really sure how to depict a journey to the center of the earth in a space-ship like vehicle. So we end up with a lot of shots where the ship seems to be traveling through a vague, nebulous electrical cloud. I won't even discuss the laughably bad destruction of Rome, Italy sequence.I know some will defend this as a mindless popcorn flick. But how many times can we watch the same old story unfold?

Armageddon, for one is better than this film, and to be honest that's not saying much. This film, like the one just mentioned is humorous at points and also has a fair amount of tension as the crew encounter various obstacles along the way. The acting is fine, but some of the special effects a pretty lame and by the end of the movie the importance of starting the earth's core again takes a back seat to all of the problems that seem to arise along the way. Therefore, the movie begins to lose focus and subsequently I began to lose interest. So to conclude, the plot is highly improbable and it's an altogether unoriginal film but with some interesting dialogue and fairly charming characters it just about holds your interest through to the denouement. 4/10 (2*)",The Core

Next, we have to figure out what the problem is.  Then we have to determine if the problem can be resolved and if it can, how?  Who is so good as to determine the earth's core has stopped spinning because of an unexplained electrical storm in California and an attack of birds gone wild in Rome. Who would just happen to have a vessel, named Vergil, that can actually surf through the earth's core of over 9000 degrees without disintegrating.  What team of the worlds far most scientific, master minds would volunteer to journey to the center of the earth to jump start the core and what computer geek could stop a top military project dead in it's tracks within minutes of a request?  Someone has an overactive imagination and was able to put it in writing and tastefully present it on the big screen.I must say, Jon Amiel did an excellent job of directing this movie into a suspenseful, action packed, science fiction thriller.  I was entertained every step of this fantasy of a movie.  A lot of research went into this story - it's almost believable as numbers are calculated, meetings are held by top brass, and billions are spent to turn a 10 year project into a 3 month project.  Their plan to restart the earth's core even has a contingency plan called Destiny, which could turn out to be the death of the planet or our hero.The success of The core depends more on God than on science as we don't have the know how, equipment or power to deliver the resolution outlined in this movie.

What would you get if you crossed Armageddon with Independence Day?  The obvious answer would be, Hell.  Hollywood's answer turns out to be, ""big opening weekend grosses and a successful run on video.""  So, we're given The Core, quite possibly the worst disaster flick to hit the multiplexes to date. The Core would be laughably bad, if it didn't happen to be so bad that it was impossible to laugh at.  The film starts so-so enough as to lead the unsuspecting viewer to believe that the movie will only, ""kinda suck."" Weird things are happening around the globe.  Flocks of pigeons forget how to navigate, swooping down into crowds of unsuspecting citizens, as though they were auditioning for the next made-for-TV sequel to The Birds.  A bunch of people's pacemakers stop working simultaneously, causing the poor folk to instantaneously drop dead.  And then there's the whopper; a space shuttle has a heck of a time making its re-entry to earth. At this point, geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and this French dude (or should I say ""Freedom dude?""), with a strong knowledge of weapons, are called in to Washington D.C., to find out what's going on.  It turns out that the U.S. Government has created a device that would make Dr. Evil green with envy. What has been created is a weapon of mass destruction that works underground, in hopes of causing earthquakes in enemy territories.  When the device of doom ends up not working, and instead causes the earth's core to stop spinning, a bunch of scientists and astronauts need to find a way down into the core, to start things spinning properly by detonating a nuclear weapon in the center of the planet (huh?!?). The select group is collectively known as ""terranauts.""  The people playing the terranauts are a fairly large bunch of talented actors and actresses doing really bad work.  With the screenplay they were given, it's no wonder actors of Academy caliber come off as being no more gifted than those child actors on that old The Land of the Lost television show, did.I'm actually going to give most of these actors their dignity, and refrain from using their names.  There is no way any of them did this film to expand their artistic horizons.  The stock characters, clichéd dialogue and predictable behavior found in the script could, in no way, appeal to them. Therefore, I'm assuming that they signed on for nothing more than a paycheck.  As they will desperately be trying to do within a few months, let's forget their minor artistic discretions, and hope that they select better roles next time.  For now, I will simply continue to call them, ""terranauts."" Going back to the preposterous plot at the center of The Core, the problem these, uh, ""terranauts"" have, is that they need some super fakey device to take them on their journey to the center of the earth.  Thank god for those reclusive, but genius, scientists living out in the desert. Utah desert dweller, Dr. Ed ""Braz"" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) has, presumably for lack of something better to do, been creating a craft for that special time when the earth's core stops rotating due to a doomsday weapon meant to cause earthquakes under ""naughty"" countries.  His problem? He has another five or ten years before he could possibly get a working model of the submersible device built. In only a year's time, the entire earth will be destroyed, due to the fact that its electromagnetic field is falling apart.  To add insult to injury, big storms of electricity and microwaves, will demolish buildings in much the same way that those alien ship thingies demolished them in Independence Day. Dr. Brazzelton gets cable out there in the desert, right?  He must be aware of the kind of damage those alien blasts did in 1996's sci-fi destruction film. After being offered a ton of money from the Government, ""Braz"" decides he can have the whole ten year project completed in a few weeks (or was it months?  Does anyone really care?).  Brazzelton succeeds in building his earth submersible, and, before you know it, the terranauts are digging their way toward the planet's core at about 100 miles per hour. Numerous things get in their way, such as the earth, but they do eventually make it to their goal, but only after losing almost all of their fellow terranauts.  But things aren't over yet (although, closing in on the two hour point, you sure wish they would be). Lots of last minute stuff goes wrong, and it looks like the terranauts may not be able to save the planet, after-all.  GASP!  I won't give away the ending, but I'll gladly tell you, right from the beginning, that this film is such a waste of your time, you'd be better off watching Armageddon again, and as much as I hated that movie, this is as far from a ringing endorsement that I could ever give.",The Core

Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood, etc. I will go over the plot.It's about these group of scientists learning about the earth's center core led by Aaron Eckhart (from The Dark Knight as Harvey Dent/Two-Face.) They soon realize that the earth's core has suddenly stopped rotating, and then Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby, Freedom Writers) starts investigating the mysterious change. They built this massive, narrow underground machine to reactivate the core back up and running, otherwise, it's the end of mankind.Even though this is a science fiction movie, there are a few disaster elements that happen in the movie, like the city of Rome, Italy gets destroyed by a lightning storm, intense heat melts the Golden Gate Bridge, and birds go crazy in Trafalgar Square, London.I don't want to get into more detail on this movie, but I thought it was one of the ""best science fiction films ever created"", it was intense, suspenseful, and awesome.

Movie like this is more about the expedition and the sense of discovery and exploration. The characters in this movie are teamsters not creatures.

I understand making things up to make the concept work like unobtainium, but it's like they read a 7th grade science book and said that's good enough, we'll just make up the rest and/or change it for effect. Hillary Swank's expressionless face during her emotional scenes was reminiscent of her part in The New Karate Kid. I said ""oh my god"" in disbelief so many times in this movie I couldn't even begin to count. Especially when the nuke fell over on on Keyes and Zimski tries and fails to pull it off of him, so Keyes tells him to save himself and he goes to leave, just to have it fall off of him when the ""ship"" makes a quick maneuver. Only then to roll onto Zimski rigyt after and we see the exact scenario repeat in reverse...Keyes tries and fails to move it and Zimski tells him to save himself, but Keyes gets out and the door shuts and locks...only to have the nuke roll off of him immediately after. I kid you not, this was the dumbest ""self-sacrifice"" scene ever. At least he could have done after was shout ""oh come on!"" but, alas, humor was not a concept this movie wanted to utilize.

But if you put your brain in 'low-power mode' as you should, this movie is quite entertaining. The assumption that this movie should stay in touch with reality is just plain wrong. For starters, it revolves around the feat of humans traveling to the earth's core. That should ring a bell already, and give you an idea of the implausibilities introduced.At one point one of the characters says ""what if"", and that is exactly the premise of this film. Of course it is impossible to 'see' anything down there, and of course nothing hollow could survive amidst a sea of high-pressure magma. But the movie starts out from the question ""what if all these things *would* be possible after all?"" This opens the doors to an alternative world, and within this alternative world this movie just works. The problem is most likely that the movie may seem to pretend that its science is real, while in other movies it's more obvious that pseudo-science or magic is involved. Just remember that this movie *is* based on pseudo-science and you'll have much less trouble enjoying it.The story is a pretty average disaster movie scenario, but not too predictable to become boring. Action is well spread over the movie so one neither gets exhausted nor waiting for the next big thing to happen. Acting is pretty average, with some good and some so-so performances. Add some quite nice special effects, and what you get is not the greatest cinema ever, but still a nice piece of popcorn entertainment to spend the evening in your favorite couch after a hard day's work.

174,FilmWiz,Excellent Sci-Fi. 'Armageddon' going downward.,8,6 April 2003,"As the Earth's electromagnetic field begins to deteriorate in such a manner, the next best thing that humankind can do is to save itself from total destruction. When the core stopped spinning, the only way to save the Earth from being a microwave is to dive into hellish temperatures to start it again. 'Earth has a deadline' 'The only way out is in.' and this is true for the entirety of the filmWe learn that the government has implanted DESTINY, a nuclear weapon, into the center of the Earth. It therefore caused the earth to stop spinning, which in turn, is disintegrating the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field is which gives the poles a magnetic force, and allows a compass to work the way it does. It, most importantly shields us from solar radiation.In any case, these fields are disintegrating by the moment and mankind must find a way to replace them, and destroying a nuclear weapon with a nuclear weapon is their only hope. An eye for an eye; a nuke for a nuke. Since electricity was becoming more and more scarce, and radiation was becoming more powerful. Everyone in certain areas with a pacemaker was killed by radiation. The radiation caused the pacemaker to stop working and the fields was allowing it. The birds no longer had the ability to navigate properly. Thunderstorms with on hundred bolts per square foot. People are dying instantly from intense radiation. There is nowhere on Earth to hide from it.So we must build a ship with 100 tons of warheads. How about we call it Virgil? Sound good? It better. Anyhow, we find the most diverse 'terranauts' (These don't exist. yet.) we can find: a Physics professor (Aaron Eckhart), an arrogant scientist (Stanley Tucci), a real NASA astronaut (Hilary Swank), a rocket scientist (Delroy Lindo), as well as other, less important characters. They all have on purpose. DESTINY must be blown up into little pieces.As the seemingly natural phenomenon's become deemed unnatural, the crew has only three months to build and deliver to the crust what they deem necessary. They will have to go inside the crust to destroy DESTINY. How to do it? Well, there is a new unobtanium, created by Braz (Delroy Lindo), which can withstand any temperature or heat. So they build Virgil, a massive ship that can sustain any amounts of pressure or heat. They will go underneath the crust of the Earth, and into the core, where they must destroy the nuke.But things, as always do go wrong. The density of the core was miscalculated, therefore needing more nukes to destroy Density, and they do not have enough. If they are not able to destroy DESTINY, DESTINY will destroy the world, and there will be no one to stop him.The special effects are awesome as they most often are in pictures such as these. Although, can you say 'Armageddon retread'? I liked this film a bit better then Armageddon, however, the plot is, at times a bit shaky, where Armageddon is strictly science. Besides, Armageddon drags at times. This seems to move quicker than your average sci-fi film.This film was excellently paced, and they use widescreen techniques to the grandest scale possible. The film uses science as a key element, and, unlike other film, does not often have 'personal' scenes. (I.E. a man saying bye to his wife, on satellite.Eckhart and Tucci are a great team and should most definitely be in another picture together. Tucci claims Zimsky as his own, and portrays him in a great way. I would like to see them reprise their characters in this film, also. They were the strongest character and it shows. Although many in the cast are unknowns at the moment, it is Eckhart and Tucci who will make it big within the next few years. (Eckhart already has some major projects scheduled for next year.)The only point that kills this film from getting a 8 is what happens to Keyes, and the NASA astronaut in the end.

It's a fantastic comedy. Those twirling pigeons on Trafalgar Square alone were a riot! High precision was involved in those pigeons aiming for all the available windows. Wave after wave of aimlessly attacking (...) birds. Notice how all the cars and buses were going at full speed just so they could spectacularly crash in flames. Exploding things, crying kids, this scene has it all. The pigeon intermezzo was almost as funny as Mel Brooks' spoof of Hitchcocks Birds in his own ""High Anxiety"".That ""rocket train"" shooting through the ocean, through the Earth's crust and heck even to the Earth's core is phantasmagorically incredulous. It takes guts to come up with stuff like this (or lack of coherent thinking). My personal favourites were all the lighting down there which makes everything so beautifully visible (phew - we'd have a dark movie otherwise) and those mountain-sized diamonds...Awww...and those whales escorting the ship and finally saving everybody...too sweet.I loved the coincidence that this American ship just happened to shoot out of bottom of the Ocean next to Hawaii.

When i watch a movie like ""Armageddon"", ""Die Hard"", ""Reign of Fire"" or, in this case, ""The Core"", i expect only to be entertained. So a lot of plot-holes in movies likes this did not really disturbing for me. When i detect a plot hole, i say to myself a short ""Come on, it is only a Hollywood entertaining movie"" and it goes on. The same at ""The Core"". It starts with a lot of plot holes. A new matter, that withstands all temperatures, a new machine, that can reach the earth's core, a new laser-drill and so on... developed by one man living in an old hangar (perhaps is is a good idea to take a look in the garage of my old neighbor, perhaps he is working on a hyper drive-modul??). OK, i thought, this are probably the biggest plot holes in the movie, but it goes on, and on, and on. The holes got bigger and bigger, and in the last 30 min. runtime they got so big, that you can drive the whole earth through it without any problems, i.e. tuning A-bomb with the plutonium from the ships reactor! Come on, a A-bomb is not like some firecrackers, that you can tie together to get a bigger bang!The most disturbing for me was, that not only the title, but the entire main-plot of the movie was stolen from ""Deep Core"". OK, ""Deep Core"" was only a very cheap B-Movie (made in 2000), but the idea with the A-Bombs (in ""Deep Core"" there was only two of them) and the separation of the Modules (in ""Deep Core"" it was only one module) from the ship (including the one crew-member that remaining in the separated module) was without a doubt a rip off of ""Deep Core""!

Well, I DID review it, but i got taken down because i forgot to answer whether it contained spoilers or not. I think the same went to A Series Of Unfortunate Events.So consider this my re-review.All around the world, strange things have been happening: people with pacemakers have been dropping dead, flocks of birds in london have gone Hitchcock, and a strange-looking cloud has appeared. Boring old college professor Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) has attributed them to one thing: the core of the earth has literally stopped spinning. And if we don't do something fast, within a year our planet will burn to death by the sun's rays. The best solution is to build a ship to- and this is no joke- drill to the earth's core and hopefully kickstart it with nuclear weapons. Yeah, because it worked in Deep Impact. The team assigned to the task is Keyes, egotistical scientist Dr. Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), the ship's creator and frenemy to Zimsky, ""Brazz"" Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo), French arms expert and friend of Josh's Serge Levesque (Tcheky Karyo), Army lady Rebecca ""Beck"" Childs (2-TIME OSCAR WINNER Hilary Swank) and her supervisor, Bob Iverson (Bruce Greenwood). Assisting them on the surface is expert hacker Rat (D.J Qualls).There's something in there about what really happened to stop the core but this summary's getting too long.So many bad things about this movie: Nothing makes any scientific sense; They literally call the ship's material ""Unobtanium"", which isn't even a real term; The acting was pretty mediocre; They tried to imbue some drama, but didn't work, they kill off 80% of the main cast, INCLUDING the African-American; and they gave Alfre Woodard a non-significant role.It's almost as if they made this movie just for me.Yes, at the end of the day, even with all those flaws, i still enjoyed The Core.

It seems like almost a reverse of the movie ""Armageddon"". A group of scientists discover that the earth's core is about to stop spinning, thereby causing disasters around the world. Dr Josh Keyes realize that there is something very wrong when a bunch of people with pacemakers suddenly die, and flocks of birds suddenly start dropping out of the sky. Keyes realizes that it has something to do with the earth's magnetic fields. Keyes meets up with another scientist, Dr. Conrad Zmiky, and together they begin to understand what is happening. At the same time, the space shuttle is entering the atmosphere, and on its way to landing, when the crew suddenly see that they are about 100 miles off course, and about to crash in Los Angeses. One of the pilots, (Hillary Swank) makes a daring landing in a drainage channel, and is chosen along with her fellow pilot for a mission to save the earth. Another scientist Braz (Delroy Lindo) has the concept for a craft able to make the journey to the center of the earth. The mission: the crew must deposit several Multi-megaton warheads at the center of the earth, and hope that the resulting explosion will be enough to start the core spinning again. I would have to say that all the actors in this movie gave a powerful performance. Most especially Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, and Delroy Lindo. Their broad knowledge of physics adds to the intensity of the film, and ultimately has them at each others throats. This is evident when Dr. Zmisky is knocked out after he goes on a rampage. During this mission, another disaster occurs when deadly microwave radiation is allowed to penetrate the atmosphere, causing the Golden Gate Bride to be destroyed. Eventually it is a race against time, as the crew realizes that the nukes they have onboard may not be enough to do the job. Add also another situation brewing on the earth's surface concerning a secret project that the U.S., whereby they have the capability to  unleash earthquakes on other countries at will.

It was somewhat formulaic with the disasters that befall the crew and the sacrifices they make, but I was entertained. It would have been helpful to know more of the backstory.  Let's face it Star Wars has PLENTY of story.  The visual effects were awesome and the surround sound in my theater even had the floor vibrating so that helped, but I still never felt like I was actually there.

196,selenedm999,craptacular! **contains possible spoilers,5,26 March 2007,"Well...The Big Dumb Action movie sub-genre known as the Disaster Movie certainly has its share of expensive, implausible examples: The Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, etc. The Core sits right alongside these movies and outdoes them in dumbness. While it wasn't horrible, and had moments of being a fun ride, The Core was far from great.The plot is just about as ridiculous as it gets: the earth's core has stopped turning, and a crack team of ""experts"" has to (what else?) set off a nuclear warhead to start it up again. These include the Aryan (blond, built, square-jawed) academic played by Aaron Eckhardt, the SuperWoman navigator played by Hilary Swank (i.e. White American Alpha male and female), plus a French guy, an old guy, and a black guy. Who do you think is going to kick it? The team inside the Rocket to the Centre of the Earth plays out its inner tensions against the team on the surface, which includes the always awesome Alfre Woodard as a sort of Lt Uhura whose responsibility seems to be to talk to the team, Richard Jenkins as a by-the-books-need-to-know Military Overlord, and DJ Qualls as comic relief-cum-hacker. Even though the cast choices are great, unfortunately the characters have barely even enough character to be stereotypes, and their real purpose is to move around the movie magic of a planet falling in on itself.So a giant penis, I mean rocket drill, hurtles in a large vagina, I mean tunnel, into the earth's core, which calls up all kinds of images about returning to the womb. They've made it out of some magical substance that gets better the more pressure you put onto it, cooled it with liquid nitrogen so it'll withstand the nine THOUSAND degree heat, and made its occupants into superheroes that can casually lift a series of warheads and move them into separate compartments for detonation. Not to mention the super-laser beam that will blow holes through rocks, allow the ship to glide through, and have the holes effortlessly close behind it. All of that is taken care of in the whole ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that's necessary to watch a movie like this, so I'll forgive it, because of the sheer joy of any disaster-movie. You watch it to watch the heroes get stressed out, and overcome it through the overwhelming force of their American spirit.And boy, is this movie American. Not only do you have the clean-cut stone-chiseled action heroes win, but for some reason, the entire PLANET is screwed, and the Americans seem to be the only ones with the brains or powers of observation to even notice, let alone try to fix it! Never mind the other hundred or so ""First World"" countries that might possibly have scientific researchers or be looking at electromagnetic activity.If you want depth or character or a believable plot, this isn't the movie for you. If you want a fun ride, good actors who must be doing this for money, and a vast imagination that compensates for its implausibility, enjoy. Myself, I couldn't help thinking of DJ Qualls' comment in the commentary for Hustle and Flow--he was proud they'd made H&F for less than $1 million, because he'd watch other movies and think ""You spent $XXM on this?""

My main problem is that nowadays, a B Movie seems to be one that cost millions and makes no money. They are trying to pass B movie material off as an A-movie release. Hilary Swank obviously wanted a mega-crowd pleaser on her resume to bolster her price after winning an Oscar. Why else would she chose this. Why did she chose this one though...

The Core asks us not only to suspend our disbelief, but to leave it in the car. My mind boggles at the amount of bad science...from a single scientist that invents the amazing laser drill and(!) a totally new material that is impervious to temperature, pressure and converts those elements into energy (but not used for an energy source until...later). A series of PRECISION blasts must be made, and in the end a lump of plutonium is 'duct taped' to the bomb, this will produce a bigger bang?? I seriously doubt it. A hole that allows raw microwave energy appears...not at the poles, where the field is naturally weak, not over the 7/10ths of the earth that is ocean, but right on top of a major city. And these suits! wow! fabric that is capable of zillions of pounds of pressure? and they pop in and out of them so easily! Too bad they didn't have them later, just swim up in your supersuit...(heck, ida never took it off!). The crew! NASA pilots?? why not deep oceanographers? closer to the environment involved. I could go on and on, and who knows maybe a list will be started on the sheer number of bad science events in this steaming heap.

199,schaefer.oliver,The better Armageddon,6,13 April 2003,"Amid all those bad reviews and given the fact that Michael Bay´s Armageddon is one of the worst movies of all time, I didn´t expected very much from this one. I had some hope for this movie, because Jon Amiel also directed the wonderful ""Sommersby"" and the great but underrated ""Copycat"". The cast was as good as it can be in this kind of disaster movie, especially Stanley Tucci as Zimsky, who clearly had lots of fun with his role. The rest was ok. The camerawork was excellent, the film has some fine FX, especially the space shuttle sequence, and it unfolded at a good pace. To me it didn´t seem to run 135 minutes. Obviously logic isn´t something you should look for in this one, but most of the scientific and technical details can be swallowed, except for the material the ""Virgil"" is made of. Do I have to say ""Unobtanium""? I laughed out loud, the moment Delroy Lindo took this word in his mouth (Watching this film in Germany, most of the other people in the cinema didn´t get it, because in the dubbed version they didn´t translated this word into german). All in all I really enjoyed this movie and can recommend it to everyone who likes this kind of popcorn flicks.",The Core
200,driffma,Straight to the core of awful,4,28 May 2003,"The Core.Constant Reader, I must make a confession.  It may damage my credibility with you, but I hope not.  I liked this movie.  There it is.  I said it. Some of you will no doubt use this confession as the final proof that I have absolutely no taste in movies.  Some of you may find yourselves saying something like the following: `Why is he seeing crap like The Core when far better films, The Hours for instance, are at the local multiplex? This just shows that he knows nothing, not one goddamn thing, about film!'   Maybe you are right.  And if my hushed confession concerning The Core helps you to drop one more bit of reading from an already overstuffed schedule, great, good for you.The Core, I must say, is not what anyone might mistake for good film.  It has an incredible amount going against it.  For starters, the premise, well..it kind of sucks.  The core of the earth has stopped spinning, but lets give it that.  This is a disaster movie after all and something had to happen.  The dialogue is sometimes as bad as the tagline that was on the movie's poster:  The earth has a deadline.   I am not kidding that is what it said.  Go look at the poster if you don't believe me.  The science is awful, no real surprise there eh?  (Geologists may walk away happy, mildly anyway.  The movie gets a few basics right.  The earth is not flat, or hollow, and does not wobble erratically on its axis to the chagrin of lost advanced civilizations.  The earth has a core, and mantle and crust. It has a magnetic field.  Hooray for Geology! The rest of the sciences have absolutely nothing what so ever to be happy about.)  The film is also peopled with all the usual character types that you find in disaster films. There is the cocky pilot (or firefighter or climber or whatever), the wise captain, the heroic scientist who discovers the Problem, his colleagues, and the eccentric (there maybe two of these in this film).  So yeah, it has problems.  However these points are problems only if you go in expecting something like a good, original film.  And if you go into The Core expecting that, you deserve every miserable minute of the film you are able to endure.
Now most disaster films are crap.  No question about it.  Deep impact? Volcano?  Utter crap.  But the good ones play like some sci-fi flick out the late 40s and 50s.  They are high on energy, and excitement, and they work the clichés well, not so high other things.  In the ones that work the actors are obviously having fun, giving the characters their full attention and skill.The Core is a tongue in cheek disaster film.  It never takes itself too seriously (and with this material that is a good thing).  While the disaster film is often not too concerned, even remotely, with say, the laws of physics, it does seem to hold sacred two truths about humans.  The two holy truths in disaster films, good and bad, are:  ingenuity and sacrifice. Disaster films are fascinated with the way we often can pull off the impossible, even when time is short and the stakes are quite high.   The other truth, involves that willingness, almost thoughtless, to sacrifice oneself to save lives.Director Jon Amiel has pulled together an amazing cast for what amounts to a big-budget B movie.  There is in fact not a bad actor in the bunch. Hillary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Delroy Lindo, Tchecky Kayro, and Stanley Tucci, have all been great films.  In this film they bring a lot of energy, and enthusiasm to their parts, and are fun to watch.  I got the feeling that everyone involved kind of knew they were making a big B movie.  I hope that is the case.  But even if it is not the result is still the same.  The special effects are pretty good, and the script deliciously bad.  So no it is not a great film, not even a good film. If however you are willing to check your brain at the door, it is a fun movie to watch.  And sometimes that is better than enduring `great' cinema. Honesty requires that I give the film a 4/10.   That is a pleasant and enjoyable 4.",The Core

I won't mention any here because of spoilers. The plot was weak and overused to say the least. The scientific part of this movie was just insulting, im 17 and I could see through their obvious bullshit. The special effects were pretty nice, which was one bonus.

I pretty much agree with that assessment.  As such, it is a very entertaining movie to watch.  There were several minor problems with the story and/or how it was presented; but the show was entertaining enough that I could overlook them (i.e. too much camera time on disasters (e.g. wacko birds), untested craft works first time, unpowered ascent at the end).The major problem with the movie was the whales.  Yes, whales.  Why do whales have to come and save the day for the protagonists at the end???

211,monolith94,mining for unobtainium,8,27 January 2006,"The characters are broadly sketched, of course. The science is ludicrous, but no one asks you to buy into it. Perhaps the film does seem to take itself a bit too seriously at times. However, in a film where the rules of the day are constructing phallic, earth-penetrating ships from a material known as ""unobtanium"" perhaps some of the common expectations we hold for films should be thrown aside.The easy comparison for the film is, of course, the lamentable Armageddon. One only has to look at how the characters are portrayed in the two films to realize that the makers of the Core see themselves as working on a higher level. The assembly of a squad of technicians almost always stands in for the squad of film-making technicians: whereas the heroes of Armageddon are working-class, unsophisticated, and rather haphazard, here we have scientists, engineer-dorks, a scientist who steals other peoples ideas and a tremendous NASA over-achiever.However, The Core reaches beyond even self-conscious winking at the audience, and works as actual poetic metaphor. The story itself, when they enter the magma, has sacrificial and cthonic connotations that are reminiscent of Ancient Greek tales of descent into the underworld. Indeed, at nearly every stage of the journey, a sacrifice is made, culminating with our scientist-heroes actually arguing over who gets to die for the cause.The first time I saw this film, I found the concept amusing - Hollywood guilt transformed into the wholesale slaughter of their screen surrogates. On returning to the film, I find that I can pick up on the subtleties of emotion. I deny the very idea that the film is bad then: the actors have absolute conviction. Aaron Eckhart, coming from a long-line of scumbag characters, makes for an authentically plebeian hero. When Stanley Tucci begins to crack under the high-pressure ending, one cannot help but wince and empathize. As Delroy Lindo becomes overwhelmed by the destructive light of magma,the effect is more than simply profoundly sad for this man who wishes to shed his own blood for his ship, but reaches the near-transcendental.Everyone (in movies, that is) has been to space. Space is easy. The Core takes us into a subterranean journey which, although occasionally wallowing in clichés, manages to be something quite a bit more. The use of rich purples and blacks as Eckhart carries fuel rods into a compartment near the end of the film carries striking emotional effect. The director more than winks at his audience, but plays a fair game of narrative.",The Core

The cast of The Core is great, almost brilliant in compare with Armageddon and the story is almost more believable. (almost!). I think it's far less ""stars and stripes""-propaganda, trying to take a much wider aspect on what ""saving the earth"" would mean (within the realms of an pop-corn-cinema adventure like this). There is really nice done CGI's and nice set-design and the overall look of the movie is well done, sexy and tasteful (and maybe a little bit too clean if you are not into that kind of neat CGI stuff).

On the other hand, if you like adventure, drama, great production values, a great script, a lush score, and some of the best actors on the planet, AND if you allow for suspension of disbelief and the right amount of cheesiness, you are going to like this film a lot. All the bad reviews must come from people that can't deal with any of the above-mentioned.To get it out of the way: technology- and physics-wise there is some serious felgercarp going on in this movie, and I mean across the board. I won't go into details - read the goofs section here or all the one star reviews if you need to know. And the CGI VFX are really not really up to the standards of their time (as a matter of fact, I saw the film for the first time in 1080P the other day and was taken aback how much worse the VFX look in comparison to the slightly more forgiving SD version).But what really stands out in a positive way are two things: At first a brillant script with near perfect pacing. The way the story develops, characters are ... eh, characterised, who dies when and for what, drama versus thrill versus fun - I can't think of any better way of doing it, at least when it comes to the adventure genre in general. The script is even suitable for studying pacing when you're in film school.And at second a brillant cast. Stanley Tucci is one of my all-time favourite actors anyway, but he is only one of many shining stars here. Reading in other reviews about bad acting in this film is slightly disturbing, to be honest. Go and watch for yourself. If any of the actors here is one of your favorites: None of them is going to disappoint you.Add to that great set design, great production values (the CGI stuff aside) and some scenes that are real nail-biters, and you have a great sci fi adventure. I really don't get why it gets lambasted so much. Maybe it's because the film doesn't even take itself all too serious and that's not obvious for everybody. The clue is in naming the metal the 'Virgil' is made of 'Unobtainium'. Can anyone be more meta than this?If there was a genre called 'science fiction action adventure disaster drama', then if would fit this film. To find a comparison: I personally think it's by far a better film then 'Armageddon', although there are similarities in premise, drama and pacing.

I can get into a far-fetched idea, but this pushes the limit. With some decent execution, I might have forgiven the stupidity of sending a craft of people to the center of the earth. Maybe it could have been saved with some cool effects, but they were simply awful. Maybe it would have worked if Eckhart and Swank would have played up the camp factor of such a ridiculous project, but instead the went for soap opera-level overacting.

223,zabelardo,Super Dildo Saves Earth,4,13 July 2007,"I'd say half of the movie is Hollywood fiction, and the other half could be a remote possibility- only because I believe that the Earth's magnetic poles have shifted, in the distant past. However, I don't think jump-starting Earth's nickel-iron core, will resume proper rotation, preventing gravity failure from sucking every known object out into space.I was fascinated by the visual renderings of what may lie beneath the Earth's crust...especially the hot, hostile environment inside the Mantle. Can you imagine? I still laugh at the deep-burrowing craft developed for the mission itself....which is the mechanical equivalent of a Diamond/Carbide-toothed sea Lamprey(species of Leech).I agree the filmmakers opting for such a lofty objective, were obviously gunning for huge box-office receipts just like Deep Impact, and Armageddon.

228,scifiguy-2,Stinkburger with Limburger Cheese,2,30 March 2003,"This is the worst science fiction film ever produced. The laws of physics have been rewritten to the extent that this can't even be classified as sci-fi, but instead is pure fantasy. The story's basic premise is that the Earth's magnetic core has stopped rotating, and it'll take nuclear bombs to restart it. First of all, the earth's core does rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet. It takes about 120 years for the liquid portion of the core to make a complete rotation independent of the Earth's 24-hour spin. The magnetic field is produced by convection and circulation of the molten metals. So the basic premise of the film is seriously flawed from the beginning, but that's nothing compared with the liberties the script takes with natural science. Lets go over a few of the worst examples, shall we? If the earth's crust could be penetrated down to the liquid core, it would result in the creation of the world's largest volcano, and the ship would be ejected in the eruption. The ship is shown dodging mountain sized diamonds in the earth's core. I did my homework and discovered the melting point of diamonds is 6,900 degrees Fahrenheit, and the temperatures in the core reach near 10,000 degrees. This leaves a slew of plot holes open. First of all, the ship would have to be much stronger than diamond, which is the hardest known substance. Even if this could be achieved, the transfer of heat would vaporize the crew and the electronic instruments inside the craft, not to mention the atomic weapons. Speaking of nukes, if a 200-megaton bomb were detonated in the core, the shock waves would destroy the ship and the Earth would be decimated by catastrophic quakes. Even more absurd, the script has the craft travel the circumference of the core (minimum 4,700 miles) within a matter of hours, releasing and detonating several nukes. In order to enhance an atomic blast, a crewmember removes the atomic power source for the ship, which leaves them without the magic ray to bore through solid rock, but they are able to return to the surface anyway. Exposure to the radioactive fuel rods would have killed him and they could not have simply been added to an existing warhead. Here are just a few more ludicrous plot elements. An x-ray machine powerful enough to penetrate three feet of lead is operating continuously in the same room with two scientists, who would be killed instantly by the amount of radiation produced. The interior of the earth is not transparent as it is depicted, nor would there be a light source to see by. The crew has radio communications with the surface, which is impossible. The Golden Gate Bridge is destroyed by solar radiation, but the cars falling from the bridge are undamaged. Lightning causes the Coliseum in Rome to explode. The later two locations were used in Ray Harryhausen's films, and I'm almost willing to give them a nod for an inside joke. An early scene in `The Core', is an obvious homage to Hitchcock's `The Birds', and is very well done. The introduction of characters and the investigation into bizarre events is far more interesting than the actual mission. There's a three-month deadline to launch a manned craft to the core, and leap 300 years ahead in science. It starts out with a crash landing of a space shuttle in present day, but we've got particle beams that can melt through mountains in seconds. In one of the rare moments of deliberate humor, it's announced the indestructible ship is to be built from a substance called `unobtainium.' More humor would've helped, but it's all played rather straight and grim. It takes itself far too seriously, considering the ridiculous premise. Like many movies, the build-up is greater than the pay-off, and in this case it was like waiting to see people flap their arms and fly away. After you've seen it, you still don't believe it.",The Core

232,kevjohn,The Bore,3,29 March 2003,"This movie is all setup and no payoff. You know it's bad when an ""action"" movie stretches the final five minutes worth of action into 30 minutes worth of screen time. But why start at the end? This film has cheese in it from the get-go.*Spoilers aplenty*It starts off wobbly, but in a way that looked to be perhaps as promising as Stargate. Drs. Aaron Eckhart and Tchéky Karyo are brought in by the government to offer up their expert opinions on a series of unusual phenomena. After being dismissed by the feds, Eckhart does some research of his own and, based on bird and whale migration patterns, determines that the earth's core has stopped spinning and the world is doomed.  After going on a bender, the good doctors alert the feds of the earth's impending destruction. The feds pull out all the stops and assemble a team and plan a mission to tunnel to the center of the earth and restart the core's rotation.This is all well and good. The problem I had with the film is not the plot, but the execution. About 30 minutes into the movie, the audience has a choice to make: either walk out mid-film, or stay seated and watch as cliché after cliché are thrown at us by the oh-so-inventive writers. (I am currently unemployed, but there are people making 6 and 7 figures to write crap like this??) First, the science is lousy! I'm no good at the science a mission like this would entail, but even I know without a doubt that the science featured in The Core is crap. Next, the characters had about as much depth and substance as the giant Core cutout that dominated my local megaplex's lobby. The characters were so flimsy that, I swear to you, I not only knew who would and wouldn't survive, I knew the exact order in which they would die. That's a first for me. The standard confrontation between the bullish Army brass and the ship's crew was right on cue. The climax is fairly tedious, just a series of small special effects explosions that were less exciting than whether the lady at the concession stand would overfill my medium fruit punch and spill it all over the counter. To make matters worse, the climax takes place a good 20 minutes before the end of the film. What follows is the ludicrous escape from the center of the earth. The ship, having shed a few sections in the execution of the mission, is now as agile as a Porsche, dodging mountain-sized obstructions with ease. Then the Navy sends what looks like half the Pacific fleet out to look for them in a very tight search pattern, but they give up after 10 minutes. ""We'll never find them. Let's call it off.""

I first watched it as a naughty internet download and then bought it on DVD as I liked it so much. I've now watched that DVD three times and have always enjoyed it. A few of the effects are a bit weak, one or two lines could be better but I see nothing to hate here.

235,octomancer,"Utterly preposterous plot, terrible script slightly redeemed by good performances and occasional humour",4,18 December 2006,"People often defend wildly impossible sci-fi by pointing out that the bounds of reality and scientific fact are stretched in most films. Fair enough. But there is a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Consistency is the key point. Get all your impossibilities out of the way quickly and then don't break the rules that you have set for yourself. The best sci-fi works because it extends or transforms a small amount of modern science and then explores the consequences. It entertains and carries us along because it reveals the details of it's assumptions in a way which makes us think we could have figured it out if we'd had more time, or were cleverer. Inherent in this process is that the revelations make sense within the parameters of the fictional world. That's the right way to do sci-fi.In ""The Core"", we have a pretty much perfect exposition of the wrong way to do it. Not much of what happens is connected to anything else, from a scientific point of view. There is just an interleaved sequence of shoddy science and hackneyed plot devices. There is no coherence or consistency to any of it. That's why it's a bad film. That the writing and editing are terrible too just adds to the misery. As I've read elsewhere, it's not a disaster movie, it's just a disaster!So why the 4 rating? It has a good cast, who play it completely straight. That helps. Hilary Swank adds a touch of class, Delroy Lindo is good, Alfre Woodward is never less than great. Stanley Tucci is a bit over the top, but is funny.

237,clay_thompson,Better than often given credit for,7,16 August 2006,"I am watching ""The Core"" after having read several other comments about the movie. The sentiments expressed go from being ""Fine Movie"" to ""Worst Movie ever,"" the last obviously coming from someone who rated ""Starship Troopers"" as the ""greatest Sci Fi movie ever made."" There are parts of this movie that are actually very good. The first thing to give credit for was the cast that they had. It is a very good cast. Let me repeat, a very good cast. Alfrie Woodard has never given a bad performance, and although her role was relatively small, she brought moral gravity to the role that the movie needed. Delroy Lindo showed a range that I have never seen him do. Obviously better recognized as a man in control, he was nigh on perfect as the forgotten but brilliant scientist who still stings over Stanley Tucci's Conrad Zimsky having stole his discoveries from a generation earlier. Tucci, a fine actor, did take it over the top a bit too much. DJ Qualls gives an underrated performance. He is 6'2"" but makes us believe he is a 5'7"" geek. He gave a touching performance as he tried to slow down the big bad that caused the problem in the first place. Aaron Eckhart, normally a baddie, did a believable performance, with Hillary Swank, a two time Oscar winner bringing her easily recognized skills to the screen. I originally wanted to blame Director Jon Amiel for the faults of the movie, but when I went back and considered individual roles and scenes, I realized that he did the job he was paid to do. The visual effects were more than adequate, constrained by the need, not for realism, but by the need to show things that would further the story.So where did it go wrong? First, the problem, I believe, was with the writing. The script was very uneven. Part of it came from what appears to be last minute changes in the story line. Early trailers suggest a very different story -- and rumors from Hollywood at the time indicated this was true.Too much of the story telling was quick and dirty, trying to just get it done. Had they not been locked in to a predetermined release date, they could have gotten the script right. Second, it seems there was a problem with editing. There were times when the film just went clunk. Was it poor editing in and of itself? Or was it editing that had to serve the problems with the script.

Oh sure, its not going to dethrone The Godfather or anything, but as a popcorn-muncher it is admirable.  The science is murky and questionable, sure, but I didn't even find myself thinking about that until after the film was over.  The effects are pretty good, though the model work is far superior to the CGI.  Acting is nothing special, but workable enough considering the material and the film's focus. The overall feeling I got was just one of fun -- I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and now eagerly await its release on DVD.

This is one of the very best bad movies ever. High production values, generally skillful, first-rate, acting. It's an adventure movie about saving the world from a preposterous cataclysm. I'ts as if a really smart teenager had listened to my friends and my playing when were seven or eight and made a movie about it.

With The Core however the imagination is stretched beyond acceptable limits as it is obviously so much rubbish that even a non technically minded person would twig it was twaddle. It's not as if the acting was well done, for it isn't, neither the script which is poor and even the effects are second rate. It must be difficult coming up with good ideas for new movies, but The Core scrapes the bottom of the barrel.

Maybe not.This is truly Bottom 500 material. The DVD cases should be labeled: ""WARNING: Core is a noun and a verb. Exposure to this movie may result in the sensation of having your skull cored out.""

Frankly, how anyone (even the ""just turn off your brain and have fun!"" apologists) can justify giving it anything above a 4 is beyond me... yet a significant number of voters must have given it 7s and 8s! I turned off my brain, wanted (and tried) to enjoy it and STILL feel my 3 vote is generous. You've heard the phrase ""eye candy"", right? The Core is eye arsenic.My only theory is that most people who actually possess brains have avoided this 'movie' entirely (unlike myself) and have not voted - while those who found it enjoyable are the same people who were unable to detect its stench from a mile away... thus, the above-average ranking.

Sure you can't expect plausibility, science, acting, heck, even the rudimentary basics of writing with mindless popcorn films such as this, but please, if you are going to recycle a movie, try to make it a tad bit unique?The plot is the nearly the same as Armageddon (woefully horrible film itself but technically superior). The only difference now is that we no longer have the wrongfully portrayed dumb Americans trying an implausible method to stop a world destroyer from space, but instead wrongfully portrayed dumb Americans causing the world destroyer themselves and then using implausible method to stop it. I'm pretty sure one of the writers went to visit his kid in grade school one morning and somehow concocted this monstrosity there:
Writer: ""Son, I have absolutely no idea where I'm going in my life."" Son: ""Daddy, lookie what I drew with my crayons!""The characters in the movie are about as stiff and two-dimensional as that piece of paper dear son drew on. Once again, the fate of the entire world rests on a crew comprised of zany cartoon (for crying out loud) characters which also includes Bruce Willis-wannabe, hard-ass military-type person, and your typical computer geek. Why didn't they include a token black guy in the movie as well, or maybe Steve Buscemi?This movie is ridiculous.

268,kliq,"Average Plot, Average Acting, Average Direction...Average Movie",5,30 March 2003,"Yes ""The Core"" looked trashy in its trailers and yes it is a pretty trashy movie. If you are a person that particularly enjoys  the gung-ho 'save the world' genre then you still might be interested in this feature. Hillary Swank has no place in this movie that is teeming with B-grade actors turning in B-grade performances. She is utterly wasted in a role that should have never been hers in the first place. The Special Effects ofcourse were the high point of the film, and lived up to expectation. The direction on the other hand, lagged and dragged, and made it painful to watch the entire movie. The movie isnt paced well, and that as we all know is critical to action flicks, especially of this type.

269,kliq,"Average Acting, Average Direction... Average Movie",5,1 April 2003,"'The Core' is another ""save the world"" movie, attempting to change the genre a bit, by not going into outer space. Instead the concept revolves around the inner core of the earth and how it has stopped spinning. As usual a band of brave human beings are selected to deal and hopefully nuetralize the problem.'The Core' falls very short in the acting department, with Hillary Swank playing a role that never should have been given to her in the first place. Surrounded by B-Grade actors turning in B-Grade performances along with the fact that her role had only B-Grade scope to it anyways, results in an absolutely sub-par showing on her part. Aaron Eckhart played his role to the best of his ability, even though that ability is only so good.Direction is key in movies, as the director is expected to keep people on the edge of their seats, Jon Amiel had me looking around the room to see how many people were sleeping through his Lava explosions. If there is one saving grace to this film, its the special effects, the effects directors definately worked hard to bring the conception of the Core of the earth to life.Nevertheless, this is a weak movie, and I would only recommend it if you had nothing to do, and wanted some eye candy. 5/10",The Core

The newest example is THE CORE, which shows a journey to the earth's outer core, because this core had stopped it's rotation. The consequences were perturbations of the earth's magnetic field what could destroy the earth. I could not imagine that the rotation of the earth's outer core is independent from the rest of the earth's body, that means that it is improbable that the earth has a differential rotation like the planets Jupiter or Saturn have: And when it would be possible, why should the core stop its rotation? And a journey to the core is completely impossible: The pressure and temperature there is much too high for any material. But what about the movie itself? I gave him 5 points. Not boring, good actors, but long before the film ends you know who will survive and who will not. When I saw this film, it seems to me that it was a remake of Richard Fleischer's FANTASTIC VOYAGE (1965) through the human body. What can I finally say? Armageddon was unwillingly funny, THE CORE was not. The effects were good, but in directly comparison with the effects in FANTASTIC VOYAGE, almost 40 years earlier, I ask myself: Where is the progress? Regards, Hans-Dieter",The Core

I don't mind letting some things go but here are a few that erk me.They designed the ship to eject a section of the hull when it has been ""breeched"". WHY did they expect that only the last section of the ship would be breeched. What would they do if the cockpit section was damaged?Why when there is an ""EM tear"" do the microwaves appear just in front of the Golden Gate bridge? On the computer screen it shows that is the only such occurance. Convenient that it just happens to appear in such a famous spot.Would it really be possible to communicate with people at the center of the earth? My cell phone sometimes doesn't work when I am on the surface?? We see no communication with the surface at all for a long section of the film and all of a sudden people are crying about the death of a crew member.The ""space suites"" were designed for HALF the temperature that it actually was down there. Not good planning! but miraculously they still work enough for a man to go out and turn a switch. Seems to me if it is TWICE as hot, you would be incapacitated pretty fast.Havent we seen too much of the super computer hacker who can do anything with his computers? An old bit to say the least.Having said all that I still saw the potential of the premise. The FX of the Golden Gate bridge were very well done. Stanley Tucci was excellent.

272,daveshubcaps,The movie does it's job well.,7,21 April 2003,"For the life of me, I will NEVER understand why some people feel it necessary to judge a spectacle movie such as The Core like it was a character-driven Art House piece!Movies like this are the cinematic equivalent of a fireworks show: It's very pretty to watch, you ""ooooh"" and ""aaaaaah"" the the more spectacular shots, you clap after the big finale, and then you go about the rest of your life. And about all you ever remember is that you enjoyed the show. Movies like these are not meant to be life-changing, they are not meant to be avant-garde (unless you're making The Matrix), they are not meant to be a study in character flaws. They are meant to take your mind off your everyday life for a couple of hours and entertain you. And that is exactly what this movie does.I never judge a movie by how ""original"" it is. After thousands of years of storytelling, you can pretty much bet just about every story theme imaginable has been done. Rather, I judge on how well they tell the story they are telling. And I have to say that they told a pretty good story in this one. Sure, the characters are pretty much generic movie characters, but the roles are well filled with good character actors (except for the hacker kid played by DJ Qualls, that man has GOT to do something about that nose!) and they do their jobs so well that I found I actually cared about them and was saddened when they died.As for the scientific inaccuracies, two things: One, don't forget that it's called Science FICTION! Secondly, I saw this movie with a scientist (she works as a chemist), who granted that the ides of how our electromagnetic field is generated is mostly supposition. But the fact is that we really don't know how the field is generated, so why not a spinning core of liquid metal? She also liked that fact that the movie used science to resolve the problems encountered.The special effects were quite good in this movie, nothing spectacular or groundbreaking though.In the end this is a good popcorn flick, which is what it was meant to be.7 out of 10",The Core

Hilary just looks and sounds painfully uncomfortable. And so she should.A special mention here for the wonderful Stanley Tucci, who combines his usual 'I'm the guy everyone wants to punch' role with a very funny take on Dr Strangelove.But in the end, this film is just too, too stupid for words.

It destroys the idea that when you aren't good enough at something to work in the field, you teach it. Professors are underrated and this makes them shine in a new light.There's this woman in a man's world. Men try to keep females off big ego boosting jobs. But she's good at it, it's her calling. She first get blamed, after all she's so pretty and young so she has to be lame, but they find out that the accident happened way before her decisions, and that they actually saved the day against all odds...There's also this geek, a pure computer genius who can hack a company with a mere piece of gum wrapping, and 2 notes of music with it. Don't mess with geeks. We also see him have a big emotional moment, so the belief that introverts are just distant, cold and calculated gets shattered. There's some deep emotions going on in there.We also have the moral that when your defense army is so full of mistrust, they can end up destroying the world and themselves along with it... and kicking a dead horse with more of the problem isn't going to cut it... even if weapons can be used to save people, you have to aim them properly, not at people, with good intentions, and even so you can die in the process...3 loved ones makes this ugly world worth saving... It doesn't have to be perfect, we don't need the arrogance to care for the whole planet to do something heroic... a simple man wishing to save what his precious to him can do a lot of heartfelt good... If everyone was to do their share, the world would become a better place way faster than superman would be able to make it. (But that's my own interpretation) You have great apocalyptic moments, funny moments, the impact on children... Rivalry and making peace, how people behind the scenes in the dirt can actually be way more productive and clever than people bragging in the spot light... How criminals can actually care much more for the fate of the world than people who think they are in charge of it and only care about their personal control, led by fear far more than reason, and certainly not wisdom.It was a family friendly movie, heart warming... It was magnificent to see deep n the earth, the giant geode and diamonds... ah~!!! And the science, maybe a lot of people hated it because it seemed far fetched... that's what we said about the greatest discoveries before we accepted it centuries after... like the earth being round, and not the center of the universe with god's eye directly staring at it... I think it is possible... I like making theories, and I recently thought about maybe the gravity isn't only done by rotating around the sun, maybe all things have a center of gravity on it's on... even people, we can take pictures of their energy (some weirdos call it auras... apparently it exists, things have one too)... so everything has energy... so I wondered if the earth could have one on it's own... that movie explained it in details! And it made so much sense (well, to me... I was open to the idea...) and how powerful is the magnetic field... enough to repel the energy of the sun so we won't boil... not just from a bas bubble's crust (ozone) but energy too... and this energy is made by centrifuge force (like turning a bucket full of water above your head fast enough, the water stays in, and the planet turning around the sun) so to have someone turning inside the earth... and how small repetitive strikes can disturb and even stop it... (or our moral and health) It's brilliant!!! The earth is alive... changing, moving... and if it's heart stops... we all die...Yeah I bet many hate the idea, because then you can't suck it's blood and do whatever you want to it... you'll poison yourself right back... to the core... how something so far from our eyes could affect us... (like the moon and the tides) and their idea of the consequences... letting the suspense intrigue us before they explain it... like how you can think that you are on top of the world, young, successful... but then in a second, out of the blue, you drop dead... How much it's important to enjoy yourself now while you still can...I felt bad when they hid the information from the population... the masses could have come up with ideas... Like putting lighting rots... that could have been useful... blissful ignorance tend to explode in your face soon or later... enjoy it while it last I guess, but then you are powerless... it wasn't an act of god but an act of human stupidity... but yeah, go ahead... just whine and blame god, way easier than do something about it, no wait you're dead.I guess people really hated to see that... hum...But the truth always come out... you can't hide it from people who want to know... people who want to tell always find a way...Because the least we can do when people die for others, is to know and be grateful.I adored this movie! Full of emotions, science, morale, colorful characters...But no sex, not even sexy clothes... no one farted... man what a flop... don't waste your time... it could make you think.. and that could make your brain create new pathways between your neurones...

Decent if not outstanding spfx. I'm pleased to report the absence of Ben Affleck branded testosterone in this movie. The ARMAGEDDON comparison is certainly not fair either: For example, THE CORE has space vehicles moving like space vehicles as opposed to X-wing fighters, and the production design is much more sober and free of the comic book logic, trite cliches and gratuitous BMW commercial style shots which plagued ARMAGEDDON. The plot is pretty straightforward: The Earth's core has mysteriously stopped rotating, which upsets the planet's magnetic field and threatens to cook all life on the surface in cosmic rays. What to do, what to do. Enter a team of brilliant clever people to build a fantastic vehicle which will take them to the center of the Earth, where they hope to jump start the core with ATOMIC POWER!In the best of sci-fi traditions the rules of the ""universe"" are established at the beginning of the movie (""Unobtainium"", heh!) -- and the neat thing here is that the movie universe is internally consistent, and follows those rules. The planetary geophysics SOUNDS believable, and  sci-fi fans should be happy that the whole thing feels 'true'. The characters in the movie are believable and their actions don't seem contrived. Even the hero is likeable and there's really no annoying bad guys being dicks for no reason. This is pretty rare in sci-fi, particularly the hollywood low-calorie brand.

Some of the classic SciFi movies of the 50s can only be described as B-movies, including some of my favorites, like The Thing (from Another World), Them and Forbidden Planet. The Core is an exciting story, with good actors playing interesting, non-heroic characters thrown in a heroic situation and acquitting themselves well.I almost missed this one because of negative reviews. I don't know what such reviewers expect of a SciFi film.  I've seen complaints that the premise is far-fetched and the technology impossible -- this last while comparing the movie to Armageddon!  Please!  If you are to enjoy science fiction films at all, you have to choke down one or two unknown technologies on faith.  Is the nuclear-powered Core-driller any harder to believe in than the Stargate? Than the notion that aliens allergic to water would invade the only planet in the stellar neighborhood that is covered with the stuff (Signs)? That computers can take over the world, but are dependent on human bodies as a power source (The Matrix)? That you can defeat an seemingly invincible alien race by uploading a computer virus into a single ship (Independence Day)? Why then is it so inconceivable that you could set off nuclear explosives in the Earth's core to counteract a catastrophic failure of the Earth's electro-magnetic field?  Science fiction movies are not required to mimic real science.  They ARE required to stick to their own rules about what is possible an what is not, and here The Core plays fair.  The film establishes its rules early on, and given the premise and the characters, I found every outcome reasonable.
Is the moral center of the story a bit cliched?  Yes.  Is the ending pure Hollywood confection?  Also yes.  But more importantly, I was intrigued by the story's central problem, became invested in a cast of characters I liked and enjoyed cheering for, and left the theater feeling that the human race could probably tackle a real challenge like the one depicted. And that is what science fiction movies are (traditionally) all about -- optimism in the future of the race.",The Core

It has a mini-romance, lots of disasters, tons of good sci-fi and good action. Acting is more than decent form this pretty strong cast. I think i have watched it like 3 times now simply for its entertaining value, Believe me... even if it needs some pretty hard ""suspension of disbelief"" in this one, it so geek fun and entertaining you wont even notice how absurd it sometimes is.

285,timberlax,Did I see the same movie?,8,21 April 2003,"I have to admit it wasn't as lame many people whine it to be. Ok, first off, this movie was not as terrible as Armageddon. The humor was JUST at the right level and I think there was only one or two corny lines throughout the film. I won't explain the plot because I think you can tell from the title that it's kinda obvious it somehow centers around the core. It has to be restarted. The science was pretty inaccurate I have to admit. The acting (I thought) was great by Eckhart (Keyes), Lindo (Braz) and especially Tucci (Zimsky; just look at his outburst towards the end) This guy is such an underrated actor.And for once a NON American is part of a crew to ""save the world"" (a Frenchman to be precise). Now, I AM American but live in France. So I was glad that Jon Amiel included the fact that not ONLY the United States has weapons of mass destruction and smart scientists. And for ONCE a computer screen in a movie doesn't display Windows (as was the case in Independence Day in the alien mothership LOL). Nice hacking moves.Whenever people praise a movie and say it's the best, blah, blah, many walk with great expectations and then most kinda lose that feeling of it being the best. And whenever people criticize a movie like this one, I, as one of many, have basically no intentions to like it when I go to see them. And the zero expectations help to enjoy it and realize it wasn't as bad as many people claim it to be. That has happened to me before. SO THIS MOVIE WASN'T PERFECT. WHAT, YOU WANNA EXPLOSIONS, MORE PEOPLE DYING?! SOME PEOPLE ARE SO USED TO PLOTLESS EYE CANDY THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO VALUE A MOVIE ON OTHER ASPECTS. And this comes from that great line by Tucci: ""WHAT YOU WANNA BE A HERO?! YOU WANA BE A MARTYR?! WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?!"" Sorry for the shouting but the movie made me want to speak out ;-). Definitely worth getting on DVD.8 out of 10",The Core

But between the lines I got the feeling that watching this movie would be the right decision.And I wasn't disappointed.I think most of you know what it is all about and I can omit the summary of the 'story'.Anybody should be aware of the fact that this movie was surely never meant to be serious and sometimes just pretends to be. It's all about a great adventure of venturing to the earth's core - awaking memories of Jules Verne. Certainly nobody had, at that time, seriously expected people thousands of miles under the ocean, walking through caverns to the middle of the earth or to be shot to the moon with big cannons...As in Star Trek they make something up which sounds cool and (at most times) fit into the story but not in our scientific point of view. Especially as a scientist I laughed out loud at various points when they talk scientific nonsense or pretend to be serious. But even including the predictability, all this doesn't diminish the entertaining potential of this film - it is certainly not a comedy but with more self-mockery than Armageddon, which is a good sign.If you know what to expect you won't be disappointed.

It has science with no seaming basis in reality, a cast of recognizable but lesser known actors, and the wanton destruction of recognizable land marks (the Colosium, the golden Gate Bridge, etc.).In the movie the earths core has stopped spinning due to some super secret government earth quake machine with the dubious name of ""Project Destiny"". To fix the problem a group of scientists and astronauts must drill down to the earths core and ""jump start"" it with nuclear bombs. Characters are killed off one by one trying to save the mission and instill some drama.The acting is not great, but then this isn't quite Shakespere. The effects are OK. They spend most of the movie drilling through the earth so there isn't a hole lot to see anyway.If you can take it for what it is (corny sci-fi) then I think you'll find it's a descent way to spend a few hours.

The science blabber takes up 95% of the dialog and you never really get to know the characters. This is how the movie is built upScience talk --> Nice effects --> Problem --> Science talk on how to solve the problem --> Problem solved. Now, you would've though that after the problem was solved, that there be a bit of dialog that fleshes out the character, but nooooooooo. Instead it says ""2 hours later"" or ""24 hours later"". I think I saw a ""35 hours later"" and then it continues in the way I just described. They could've had real good character development, because there is space for it in the movie, during these ""24 hours later"" periods, but they skip it and jump to the next problem.Unfortunately, all the *mildly* interesting characters die (which you knew anyway). This movie also has possibly the greatest *smack-your-head-against-a-brickwall* moment I've ever seen. The hacker Rat (D.J Qualls) who's job is the hack the internet so word won't spread of what happening and people won't panic over it. Of course this is a disaster flick, so there must be some destruction. So there's the little problem Rome being annihilated and the Golden Gate Bridge collapsing and if the media in TV and newspapers were still working (as you see in the movie) what was then the point with this character? Great script writing I tell ya...Disappointing, even for a disaster-flick. Nice effects though, the Crystal Sea being the best part.2/10",The Core

294,tim.state,Check Reality at the Door for 'The Core',5,14 April 2003,"Contains Spoilers With eye candy like Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank in the lead roles, The Core, is surely and easy movie to watch - as long as you've suspended reality at the door.  From beginning to end, The Core follows the Hollywood formula - hook the guys with effects and action, introduce an attractive love interest, kill a few dispensable good guys, make the token black a martyr, raise the music score and send the crowd home weeping.  As a result, we know how each character is going to respond every step of the plot.In fact, the movie is so predictable, we know what they're going to say next.  What keeps you, as the viewer, on the edge of your seat is wondering just exactly how they're going to do it.  Crash-land the space shuttle in a flood canal - brilliant.  Crazed lunatic pigeons in Trafalgar Square terrorizing tourist children - fantastic.  A convicted internet hacker felon breaking in to the Department of Defense computer system, diverting the nation's power supply from Project Destiny in Alaska to Coney Island so the singing whales have time to save our madly in love hero and heroine trapped on the floor of the Pacific Ocean - simply sweet serendipity.Like a good 'Die Hard' thriller, 'The Core' is simply - real.  Eckhart as Dr. Josh Keyes (he holds the key to saving the world) and Swank as Major Rebecca Childs (the youngest woman in space ever, she's just a child whose opinion we discount, because, well, she's just a Child) respond and react to every situation just as you would expect beautiful actors and actresses to react. Swank is appropriately cast for the role of Major Childs, a cutting edge role that literally transforms the greater role of women as heroines in action flicks.  (Not surprising after for an Oscar-winning cross-gender performance in 'Boys Don't Cry'.)As characters go, Childs grows the most in the two hours and twenty minutes, transforming from a mere hotshot child into a responsible hotshot heroine.  What's so groundbreaking about her performance is this is a role normally dedicated to a sweaty, slightly hairy and balding man.  At the core of her transformation is her role model and adversarial mentor, Commander Richard Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), who delivers a father-like lecture to the Childs early in the movie, stamping his forehead for death once he expends his plot purpose.  It's unfortunate Iverson has to fall into a vat of molten lava before Childs really hears his message.  But the setup leaves for a poignant knuckle-biting moment as the entire cast has the opportunity for the tear-jerking 'Pause and Turn' - when a character stares in the face of eminent disaster, and yet, takes a moment to pause, mourn, and remember their fallen comrade right before the music score whisks them back into action.  Oh, what a stronger person I could be if I had an orchestra of violins following me around.Dr. Josh Keyes (Eckhart), as the person who holds the key to saving the world - and thus the movie - delivers a solid performance that stays true to his character.  His global knowledge of science, his understanding of politics, and his dedication to exploration and learning should boost admissions of attractive young males at liberal arts colleges this fall.  As he lies there, in the arms of Childs, exhausted, having just saved the world and yet still uncertain of his own fate, Childs asks, 'So what's next for you?' as if stopping by Starbucks for a latte is foremost on her mind.  `Pizza,' he says.  He's saved the world, and he's going to get a pizza.  What more could this movie accomplish?  Roll the credits.I laughed.  I cried.  It was better than 'Cats'.",The Core

This is one of those films that you just have to take at face value. There was decent action and special effects and the story was fairly interesting. The whole idea of the world being in danger is not a new concept. There are many similarities to movies like ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"".

Look no further than The Core.  It sets the example for what a disaster movie should be. Character development, some smart dialogue, great actors and intense action sequences with truly awesome visual effects make this on top of all the rest.  I was surprised at the amount of character development in this film(not like an art house filmch!], but unstandard in the world of disaster movies). The writers, director and actors all worked well to bring life into the characters and have you care about them, instead of just waiting around hoping one of them will die.  Smart dialogue is also present in this movie. Comebacks, one-liners, solutions, equations and numerous other speech uttered comes through clear and well done.  It also helps that since the movie is serious(which it truly is...more believable than some non-disaster movies), it plays it fun(definitely).  Aaron Eckhart...what can I say? Truly a great actor along with everyone else in this movie.  Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo, DJ Qualls, and Tcheky Karyo all bring their characters life into our eyes before us on the screen, and all so believable.But the main thing about this movie is:  THE VISUAL EFFECTS.  These effects are extremely well done.  I give my highest regards to everyone involved in creating and bringing to the screen some of the best visual effects to be seen yet.  The scenes inside the Earth are definitely of note, as it feels as if we are actually there.  Above ground...the effects are astounding as well.  A sequence in Rome featuring thousands of lightning bolts destroying everything, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge being decimated, The United States Shuttle making a crash landing and other effects so numerous, but so well done, that we should give the Academy Award to the makers of this film NOW.Definitely see this movie.  I would pay full price to see it, and I've seen it twice so far this year.  Truly one of the best movies of 2003, one of my favorite movies of all time, and the best disaster movie of all time. Worth the money I've spent, and I hope to see it again before it leaves theaters.

Do you really think that astronauts would ever find a mysterious planet and later realize it's the EARTH in the FUTURE and it's overtaken by APES?!?

Double ouch!OK, plotwise it seems that some bizarre catastrophic occurrences are happening on earth (i.e., people dropping like flies, pigeons flying amok and committing suicide, etc.) After a few hours of deducing by the powers and minds that be, it seems that the earth's inner core has stopped rotating, which, in effect, is compromising the electromagnetic field, which is causing...blah, blah, blah.The effects look a tad flimsy...their travel excursion and diving about through solid rock and magma pits is one big giant computer ride on a large-scale screen a la Michael Jackson's ""Captain EO.""  No action-packed thrills here.  And, of course, one by one, the crew is predictably picked off as each new unforeseeable disaster comes to the surface.  It's been done before and done better.Eckhardt is always watchable but he and Oscar winner Swank (who looks mighty uncomfortable here) don't click at all as a pair.  Their one clinch after overcoming their final dilemma?...they should have just shook hands and patted each other on the back for a job well done.

The movie is, it itself, a decent movie....as long as you don't know a lot of science. If they would have worked closer with some real scientists they could have fixed a few plot holes and science facts. If you don't want to read any spoilers, stop now and turn away. For the rest of you: 1. Some of the special effects shots for over dramatized without thinking them through, such as a scene where cars are melting but a guy is inside cool as a cucumber, getting a sunburn when he sticks his arm out in the same beam that is melting cables.2. The cobalt cocoon scene. I believe this was originally written to be in the Mantle where the average temp is 1600F give or take....in the movie, they talk about the outside temperature being 5000F which is almost DOUBLE the melting point of cobalt. THAT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE.3. The whole concept of them dropping the bombs without being able to detach the compartments is crazy when they say that's how they were going to do it, but it never designed it that way and died having to engage the gear. I think they started reaching for ways to kill off main characters and had to get creative.4. Also has anyone considered what would happen if one of the upper compartments got damaged? The front is the control room, the only one with the front laser as well, so it would have to not get damaged and if the 2nd got damaged all of the rest would be lost too....and crushed since they would all be compromised still being connected.

It all starts with an awful script--it really seems like someone just recorded a bunch of twelve year olds playing ""rocket ship"" together--""whoah, someone diverted our energy! where's it gone?""(actual line!)--transcribed it, and decided to spend one hundred million dollars on it.No reason to write a spoiler, you've seen it all before a hundred times, mostly on television.Basically, if Ed Wood was given a gigantic budget, this is what he would've made.It just goes to show that in the words of Miles Davis, ""you can't polish a turd.""",The Core
313,sidirezegh,Horrid Beyond Belief,2,15 May 2004,"One would hardly think that, with a cast as good as this one, such an awful film could result; but, sure enough...(***mild spoilers)Basic story: Weird happenings all around the world as people with pacemakers suddenly drop dead, pigeons fly into buildings, and strange atmospheric disturbances abound; come to find out that the Earth's core has mysteriously stopped spinning, which will lead to the loss of the protective electromagnetic field around the planet. The long & short of it is that the Sun will fry the Earth in a year if some way is not found to start the core spinning again.You know you're in for trouble when first introduced to Hillary Swank's character (an astronaut) during a crash-landing of the Space Shuttle in the Los Angeles aqueduct...sheesh...Recipe for this disaster? Steal 3/4 of the content of Armageddon, mix in a dash of Independence Day, and stir it all together with ridiculous storyline and cheesy special effects; bake for two hours, and sit down to a wholly unsatisfying meal. You'll be hungry again in no time.What were Hillary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, Stanley Tucci, Delroy Lindo and Alfre Woodard thinking?

How can actors say yes to doing a movie like this? If Hilary Swank had any respect at all, she won't after this crap. I bet she and everybody else in the cast of ""the Core"" was just very broke. Im not going to list up all the things I found bad about this movie, it would probably take like a week. The only fun about this movie is that it fails so unbelievably to create any exciting scene. You just wish the characters die fast, so that you can go home and watch something with more quality. Like a Steven Seagal-film, or even a porno-flick. (I bet it's not very hard to find a porno-movie with a better screenplay than ""The Core"".)As a norwegian film-rewiewer so wonderfully put it: ""In the last scene I just waited for the camera to zoom out and show us the director with a sign that says ""Just Kidding"". That would have been something, and I'm not sure why they didn't. After all, it seems like a bad, bad parody. Do NOT see this! (The FX aren't even that good)",The Core

With special effects as cheesy as the original Clash of the Titans and characters saying and doing EXACTLY what you'd expect, you still get an enjoyable ride.
If you're looking for science or even logic, swipe left.
If you want a fun ride, with some EPIC scenery chewing, grab some popcorn and tune in.
Also, a few (perhaps accidental) nods to the original Superman.

316,start_skanking,Should have been called Coremageddon,1,28 March 2003,"Back in the days, I saw Armageddon on the big screen and even there it was a really, really bad movie. The Core manage to be even worse. It doesn't even make decent entertainment for the moment, you really just sit there and wonder when this disaster of a movie is going to end. It's the exact same film as Armageddon in every possible way. The only difference is that this time they go in to the core of the earth instead of out in space. They even manage to make the character-descriptions so shallow i wished the ""good-guys"" would die just to get rid of their über-predictable and unskilled performance. The fact that this movie is released on theaters instead of going straight to video is nothing less than humiliating. I warn you, this movie might not be worse than ""Pups"" but it sure is worse than ""The Mangler 2"" which scored 1,5 points here on IMDB.",The Core

And honestly who truly cares about the science talk. If you really want to get into it..in the end the whole this is basically impossible so calm down. And I disagree that this movie is just another bad version of Armageton. Just because it has to do with earth it doesn't mean it's the same movie. I thought there was a bit of humor in this movie as well! The idea/plot is alright but the cast and the movie overall is pretty good. I recommend it. Maybe not to watch in theaters or buy but if you catch it on TV watch it. Renting it is also a good idea.",The Core
318,earthlad,Awful awful awful....,1,2 April 2004,"I wasn't sure I wanted to see this in the theatres. There was something fishy about the trailers -- there were two distinct trailers: one which played on the whole ""journey to the core of the earth"" fiasco; and one which was much more interesting, touting the whole ""government weapon conspiracy which wrecked the world"" angle. I was more partial to the second one, and there wasn't really much of this in the film. It was mostly about putting together enough duct tape logic to get a machine that could travel inside the Earth. Unfortunately, the film played a little rough and tumble with the science, using it only when it suited them, and sweeping it under the carpet in other circumstances, hoping no one would notice.   Case in point: they go through great lengths to explain how this gadget will destroy all rock and metal which gets in its way, then come up with a fantastic new element which resists this laser drilling mechanism. Later, they find out that this drill can't get through diamonds (or for that matter, amethysts). Why not just build a ship out of diamonds? We can mass produce these now -- why not just take the existing science a step further.   Case number two: this miracle metal, ""unobtainium"", has the fantastic capability to absorb heat and convert it into energy (somehow). So later, while swimming in 9000 degree molton nickel, they use a blowtorch (!) to solder copper cables to it. There's obviously two things wrong here. #1, shouldn't this guy get electrocuted by standing so close to the bulkhead? #2, how could a blowtorch make the bulkhead hot enough to take the solder? This thing is holding back 9000 degree metal on the outside. Every calorie of heat from the blowtorch would be converted into ""energy"". I won't even go into the whole idea that heat IS ENERGY! This drove me nuts every time they mentioned it.   There's dozens of these bad science examples running throughout the film. But really, I don't care what kind of science you use, as long as you at least keep it consistent throughout.   What was even funnier about this film was the fact that they took the greatest minds in the world of geophysics, and simply dropped them into the molten mantle of the planet. Why would you do this? I'm surprised none of them dies during training... what if they were all to die instantly? Wouldn't it be a better idea since they had a RADIO UPLINK TO THE SURFACE to have some Navy/Air Force/Space program pilots drive the vessel?   As much as I hate to say it, I liked Armageddon better than this film. And I absolutely hated Armageddon. But at least it had a little star power, a little campy humour, and some personality to the characters.",The Core

Although I haven't seen this movie in years, I do recall that my palms began sweating one minute into the movie.A few scientists and space pilot people team up to do through a large digging machine to dig down to the earth's core to set off explosives that will hopefully get it running again so that the earth won't overheat.I disliked the acting although I must commend Aaron Eckhart for his performance, the plot was just not for me, and the deaths were very sad and disturbing.If you really, really like end-of-the-world disaster movies, then this just might be for you, but it was more than the plot that made me give it a 1/10.

This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen at the cinema. The dialogue is so poor a 10 year old child would have done alot better. The actors must have been picked out from a highschool play. The whole story is so silly and incredible that it makes Independence Day seem like a documentary on 60-minutes. I seriously thought that after movies like Armageddon and Deep Impact that we would have seen the end of judgement day movies with ""USA saves the world""-mentality. Those movies are worth 5 oscars each compared to this one. I cant believe that it's rated above 5 here on imdb. I'm known to my friends as a big fan of B-movies. But this was... CRAP!

Apart from a predictable plot with SGI that looks more at home in a second rate computer game there are some funny moments between the likable doctors, Dr. Keyes (Eckhart), Dr. Brazzleton (Lindo), Dr. Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) and Dr. Leveque (Tchéky Karyo).The musical score by Christopher Young is far too over the top and the end is rushed.Some of the action sequences were so badly done that I had to keep on reminding myself that it was only a disaster movie. It wasn't real. Thank goodness. The scenes just didn't grab you enough and take you along with the ride.A film I'd recommend if you don't take it too seriously.

The cast obviously had lots of fun making it (as director Amiel points out in the DVD commentary, they substituted a trout for a pigeon in one of the sequences.... just for the halibut, I guess). One of the fun parts is that no one takes themselves seriously, the actors all give earnest yet tongue-in-cheek performances, and they a play a super-stupid scientific (?!) idea with absolute deadpan.

It's farfetched fun, in the spirit of 50s sci-fi: Downright silly at times, but I grew fond of the movie's willingness to cast aside plausibility in favor of thrills and action.

Yeah OK, a literal ""journey to the centre of the earth"" seems a bit fanciful (along with cloned dinosaurs, time travel and stargates). In this respect I feel there is no point in trying to justify the movie's scientific assumptions, as do many of the comments which criticise the movie on this point. Given the stated consequences of the Earth's core stalling, a material which can stand unlimited heat and pressure, and a laser system which can bore through 10s of metres of rock in seconds, one has to examine whether the events that follow make reasonable sense. They do (the movie is quite particular on small points of logic and cause/effect, something I always like in a movie) but as always it is the drama of the events, for which the ""science"" is only a backdrop, which makes or breaks the movie.Perhaps its main flaw was relative predictability - the killing of the crew one after the other in regular sequence seemed to add to this. There was little I felt, to create seat gripping tension as our brave terranauts strove to save the earth. Even the revelation of the military's Project Destiny which had created the problem in the first place, seemed to be revealed in a ho-hum fashion.Still, an interesting sci-fi idea, great visuals, generally competently executed. 7/10.",The Core

The Core is not a good film - not by any stretch - and the ""science"" really is aggressively moronic, but it is a film that is a popcorn blockbuster, knows it's a popcorn blockbuster, and doesn't try to be anything other than a popcorn blockbuster. And it takes itself exactly as seriously as it deserves - i.e., not at all - and therefore manages to be mildly (if occasionally unintentionally) entertaining through its two-hour runtime.This sets it appart from a film like Armageddon (which features not only offensively stupid science, but equally offensively stupid story telling and production), or faux-philosophical films like Sunshine (essentially a remake of The Core, with equally idiotic science, but which tries to sell itself as ""deep and meaningful"" by a space setting, ponderous pacing, and superficial psychologising of its characters) or Ad Astra (which again uses ponderousness to try to trick its audience into thinking it is deep and meaningful and forget that the plot is stupid).

Eckhart's character has the subtle cockiness and smarts you'd expect from a lead, Swank's got the resourcefulness and levity to provide balance, and Tucci is the genius with the self serving nature and the dark wit that really let's him ham it up, something a ""serious"" actor doesn't do much these days. Are there cliches and far fetched scientific developments that stab away at the continuity? yes, but the actual saving the world part is just a vehicle for these funny and interesting characters.

The Core is a unbelieveable film that relies to heavily on the special effects to keep it going. The plot, if there is one at all, is yet another ""save the world in a short time"" bit and after seeing this movie, i wish the world would of ended right there. Of course there are the boring problems that arose several times during the film but you can predict that the heroes will pull something out to fix it no matter how crazy it is.

So the story is about the Earth's core stopping from rotating thus eliminating the magnetic field that protects the world. We know this because all of a sudden birds start flying into the buildings and the space shuttle is blown off course. So the brightest minds of the world get together and the solution they come up with is: Setting up a nuclear explosion to start the rotation again ! Never mind how they will go to the core of the Earth where temps are 9000 degrees, but how an explosion would make the liquid core spin again has got to be the dumbest idea conceived during the entire history of humankind.

Sure the science in ""The Core"" is absurd and I have better relationships with my two dogs than the on-screen lack of depth in the characters in this movie. But there was another recent movie just as absurd and lacking in character depth. Yet it was a major blockbuster when released. It was ""Armageddon"" with Bruce Willis.It's all about entertainment and imagination which when nurtured can open amazing opportunities for all of us. Walt Disney built an empire with imagination and they didn't really worry too much about the science of a Ms. Poppins flying around using just an umbrella. Just as the 1960's Star Trek influenced the eventual technology towards flip-cell phones and iPads, imagination is really what we humans do best. Because without it we're back in the middle ages fighting wars over territory in the name of God who really didn't have a lot to do with the selfish personal interests of a few looking for power and conquest at the time.Most think that when humans became self-aware that was the big deal. Well it certainly helped but imagination is how we got to our current level of technology and it will advance us into our future for better or worse. So if you are at M.I.T. or John Hopkins frustrated because you can't finally nail down the solution for cancer then watching ""The Core"" might be upsetting scientifically. But you are missing the point. It's all about imagination and who knows maybe someone watching this silly movie might spark an idea off the wall that will change humanity forever.

348,lilbuffguy,Cast outshines effects in idiotic disaster flick,4,5 April 2003,"Engaging performances by talented actors save this film from being nothing but a moronic excuse for some cool CGI. (Although in our age of war and disaster, making films where people suffer ad nauseum like this seems in poor taste.)  You know you're in trouble when the first sequence involves ten or so people dropping dead because they have pace makers.  Why would that many people with pace makers coincidentally be within the same 300 yard radius?  Was there a pace maker convention?  No...just the first of many preposterous plot elements.Amidst the mess, Eckhart, Swank, and their fellow actors manage gracefully to eke some humanity from their one-note, rather wooden roles--especially Eckhart who believably plays a sensitive college professor.  And the always wonderful Afre Woodard is delightful if utterly wasted.  But the dialogue and plot elements just get dumber and dumber.  My favorite is when our heroes--trapped in a ship with limited oxygen and time running out to save the world--allow one guy to take a cigarette break.  Hello?  Did everyone's brain just fall out?  Oh...right...we were supposed to check them in at the door.The movie, to its credit, does have a few of exciting action sequences. (Although some of them are silly and direct rip-offs of earlier films and one with dive-bombing birds is far too long and too sadistic--not unlike the movie in general.)  And, again, what surrounds these bursts of frenetic energy is so poorly written it's not only amusing when it least intends to be but repeatedly sinks into boring clichés:  whaddya know...on the journey, one by one the heroes die...just like every other Poseidon Adventure rip-off...but without Shelley Winters doing water ballet.Let's hope for better next time.",The Core
349,Marshtacular,Better than its reputation,8,25 January 2005,"The Core is a solid action-adventure/disaster flick with a novel idea and a great cast. True, it is very silly, and some of the effects don't quite come off, but that's true of most films in its genre. I've watched it on DVD a couple of times now, always late at night, always steeped in alcohol, and I have to say it passes a couple of very easy hours. The opening scene in Trafalgar Square with the crazy pigeons is better than anything in The Day After Tomorrow. And who can resist the beautiful, talented, Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank?

351,vishalg_99,A very underrated movie,9,6 April 2003,"I am not a regular voter in this forum but having seen the movie despite the critics recommendations, i thought it important(!) to speak out. If the theme of extinction-level-events (ELE) and our ability to deal with it intrigues you, certainly, you will enjoy this movie. I agree somewhat with the few that have called this movie an Armageddon without the sentimental muck.The movie is well-paced and engaging throughout. The main characters are the best you can hope for in a movie of this genre/scope/ambition. While they have their share of predictable traits they do not come through as trite. Certainly a lot of that has to do with solid, restrained performances by solid actors. Swank, Tucci, Delroy Lindo are good as always. Eckhart is a revelation to me. That the dialogs are crisp and mature, helps. The exigency of the situation is not pressed on us with overwrought dialogues. In-fact, there is a refreshing amount of levity/skepticism to balance out the fancifulness of certain ideas. The characters are revealed to us to an appropriate degree. We are spared an overdose of idiosyncrasies. There are no ghosts of past happenings, hurts and failures and other haunting motivations driving them (as if it always takes something especially bad to make us especially good).The writers/director understand that what the characters seek to do is fairly heroic in itself and for the most part avoid the lure of cheap supplemental devices such as national anthems, fond farewells, distraught family, friends and lovers (how unpalatable are they?). Again, that is not to say that the movie is devoid of predictable plot elements. There's quite a few but that won't bother you unless you are expecting a ground breaking movie.A common criticism that this movie has been subject to is how far-fetched certain ideas are. Indeed, in the quest to save the planet, a lot of things come together and work successfully in a very short of time. But still, i did not find the ideas specially unacceptable/distracting. Though a student of science, i was unable to say that such-and-such thing in the happening/solving of this ELE can't happen or can't work. Besides, one suspects, that if we were faced by such an eventuality it actually might take a few fanciful ideas and a lot of luck/gumption to avoid the fate of the beloved dinosaurs.",The Core

Yet, as far as science goes - it's mostly made up by educated guesses and observations that support them. Hints about this fact is delivered at several stages in the movie... And keeping that in mind I think it all fits together as one (far fetched as it may be) possibility.Bottom line... with an open mind and expectancies of a thrilling ride you're in for a real treat.

Yes, the science is very shaky, but no more so than any other sci-fi movie.The main difficulty I have is of the casting of DJ Qualls, who is just too freaky to be taken seriously, and Stanley Tucci. The latter is a perfectly good actor, but just did not seem to grasp the part, having the appearance of some walk-on part in an amateur theatrical production set in the 1960s.The effects are mostly excellent, particularly the shuttle landing and the imaginative depiction of the ship travelling through the interior of the earth. I rather enjoyed the 'geoid' sequence too. I studied geology, so know its all a little ludicrous, but also know that there are amazing things down there.The music score is excellent, and visually it is a very glossy product. I recommend listening to the director's commentary on the DVD, one of the best I've come across, and really illuminated the film-making process, and his enthusiasm for his own product is infectious.I can't help it!

If you want everything to be scientific and plausible, you'd be better off watching a documentary, but The Core is no less fantastic than the novels of Jules Verne (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Centre of the Earth). Instead, I think expectations have changed.Yes, The Core requires a massive amount of suspension of disbelief. And personally, I'm willing to suspend it. Would the Earth's core stop spinning? Unlikely. Would we be able to restart it if we did? Improbable. Do I care? Not one bit. The Core is a movie I never tire of, and I think it is one of the better natural disaster movies. The performances are solid and the dialog interesting. If your problem is the performance of the script, I can't say anything more, but if you're quibbling about the ""scientific errors"", and I'm sure there are many, I have this to say to you: Relax.

Unlike some Disaster movies, Volcano for an example, the characters shared their personalities. Stanley Tucchi for an example played his part as Zimsky very well.What is more enjoyable are the deleted scenes on the DVD. Like one that as taken out was testing out the heat suits. Braz (Delroy Lindo) Shoots Zimsky (Tucchi) with a flame thrower. An enjoyable deleted scene.The music score wasn't bad in the film, either. The overall film was decent.

365,mike-3406,Jules Verne meets Alfred Rosenberg,1,13 May 2007,"The Core is a boy meets girl journey to the centre of the earth in which the all American couple emerge triumphant from the bowels of the planet to continue the WASP gene pool  Jules Verne meets Alfred Rosenberg. Along the way other male rivals are summarily dispatched which is a common theme in blockbusters but not often as blatantly racist as in The Core. The mad bad and dangerous to know scientist in the form of Stan Tucci at his camp best has stopped the earth's core rotating against the advice of his younger square jawed bumbling acolyte to whom the task of restarting it befalls. Fortunately they discover another scientist who has not only discovered a way of boring through solid rock but created molecules that can withstand even the most immense pressures and temperatures - work that would normally take years, huge teams and mega-budgets but which he has managed in a few years in a remote desert hanger funded by a few credit cards no doubt. His Rotating Rabbit type machine provides the phallic metaphor that will penetrate mother earth so the seduction and the sexual act are combined and interlinked in this film. The mission to save the world from catastrophe and the rivals in the mating game are a motley crew of fractious individuals whose personal agendas keep getting in the way of The Bigger Picture. The subterranean machine is driven by a female Space Shuttle pilot whose qualifications for ""terranaut"" other than being able to fly in outer space is to have crashed the shuttle on the wrong side of the continent and provide a much needed comedy moment as she pulls up short of a worker on some scaffolding who has hitherto been oblivious to the tons of screeching high technology hurtling towards him down the Los Angeles river. She is uber-woman and she drives her own phallus which pretty soon in the film she is guiding unerringly towards the hot molten yet stilled core. The drama, if we can forget the overall narrative of saving the world, which most of the cast have done anyway, involves which suitor will finally mate with Captain Childs  yes, the child-woman. We already know that the square jawed guy is the one, but we first have to enact the symbolic ethnic and oedipal conflict where genius and race are excised from the equation. First to go is the father figure and I did enjoy the poetic way his mind was broken by a shard of crystal and his fall back to eternal rest in a stygian sea of glowing magma saved by his heat suit or a shortfall in the special effects budget from vanishing in a flash of vaporized flesh. The European, the African American and the camp, literate, intellectual would all follow before the final consummation. The climax of the mission is a series of carefully timed orgasms represented in CGI by spreading balls of light that privileges orgasm over impregnation. The diminished phallus rests on the seabed before being recovered.. there is a thesis of subtext in this film that I have barely scratched the surface of  scuse the pun - that doesn't diminish the central prominence of a nasty racist narrative that is the real core - surprising from a filmmaker like Jon Amiel. The producers managed to resist the kind of James Bond moment where he is discovered necking the co-star after saving the world. Did the world move for me? Not a jolt.",The Core

It's a genre film, so you have to accept a certain amount of fantasy and I thought they did it credibly enough to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement with no dull moments or sidebars. I've found so many recent sci-fi, end-of-the-world successes obnoxious or insulting enough in some aspects that they really marred my enjoyment. THE CORE was a hit all the way: the writing, the direction, the characters and performances (including hunky Arron Eckhart making a tough role work well), the cinematography (which was interestingwithout being too self-conscious), and the special effects, which onlyoccasionally were transparent. Given the ludicrous aspects of THE DAY AFTERTOMORROW, the mind-numbing editing of Armageddon, the kindergarten,stupid characters of INDEPENDENCE DAY. et.al. that audiences are willing toaccept, I don't understand why THE CORE wasn't a bigger hit.

Sadly this only happens in movies because if American people had said *beep* you Mr. Bush we won't go to Iraq!"", that would be a really good movie. If the general said ""We have unlimited budget, let's finish with AIDS, HUNGER, WEAPON PRODUCTION and all those disasters, I have orders from the President!"", that would be a really, real blockbuster! In that case I would recognize the talent of playing GOD! Until then... At least, on those films, they could put those bottom to top traveling lines at the end, saying something like: ""And after this ordeal, people on earth, lead by the great American people and their President, understood that it is no point on War, Excessive wealth and World control, and they all lived happily ever after!",The Core

I dared to watch this one again. What a terrible idea. I now know why I could barely watch it until the end the first time. This movie is insulting your brain. It's an insult to science, an insult to pure logic at times. The acting is maybe the best thing here, I feel like they still try to do something (not all of them, not all the time), in spite of the awful story and script. Even the music is terrible. Oh yeah, some people will say (as they always do) ""hey, it's a movie. What about star wars, they have droids, light sabers, spaceships, etc..."". The difference is that star wars is not science fiction, star wars is a space opera. And they could be using technology that we just don't know or don't know yet.

395,dutch_raven,"The Core maybe not thát hot , but it's warming...",7,19 November 2005,"What I liked most about the core were the characters, all of them! I think they made these people more realistic than in most movies I've seen. Conversations seemed real, like everyday conversing and on the level, not over the top, not too understated either. I didn't find the sci-fi part particularly hot. The journey itself was a bit boring. It seemed to be more about the people in the story than the story itself. And that's why I value it. I've heard that this movie totally sucked before I bought it (cheap), but I took the risk for a low price. And I liked it very much in general. I have a weak spot for sympathetic movies, and this is one of them. I loved the day after tomorrow for its grande scenes.. big picture stuff. I wouldn't go see The Core in the Theather, I think it works better in the familiarity of your livingroom. The characters are not underdeveloped in my opinion. It's the kind of information one would get spending time with each other in a confined craft like that. To me it is close enough to realistic character development. You do get to know these guys, and you'll probably all like them... they are very human in comparison to the blown up heroes in Armageddon, and like I said, really, in comparison to most movies. I think the scriptwriter and/or director have a knack for portraying real human beings... but it might strike better in a smaller story. Big things mostly call for Big characters to really leave an impression by the public. This was supposed to be a Big Thing, but the ""boring journey"" and the reallife acting made it come down a bit, so the insinuated Bang Bang , went poof poof with the public. Why it works that way exactly, I dunno, that's I guess why I don't make movies.. ;-) And in the end I liked the movie, so I can only say it's a matter of taste. Mainly I rent a movie to relax, so if a movie suits my purpose well, I guess I'll automatically rate it higher.",The Core

Similarily they should also do so with the clandestine subterranean Human Science facility of Grants Pass, Oregon. But the authorities are concerned about the ramifications of ending GPs for it would, much like the ending of the ""beam"" in the closing scenes of ""They Live"", expose much of ""the lie"". Grants Pass has a secret facility much like ""Project tic-toc"" in the 60's TV series ""The Time Tunnel"". The facility, a pentagon of Satan, controls all property transfers, marriages, employment etc. so as to affect an orderly society for the age-old excuse of ""the betterment of man"". But like most things it has run it's course. Nowadays all they do is cover-up their harsh and brutal psycho-subliminal past. They make sure that lab subjects do not talk and that their reassimulation into normalized society (if there really is such a thing) is controlled and that blowback and fallout is minimized.

399,dean_eilertson,I am proud of the work we did on this film.,8,5 April 2003,"I really feel that Jon Amiel did an amazing job with this film. It takes an extremely talented individual to combine performance and visual effects together. His ideas with regards to casting were brilliant and his story development allowed us to meet each character on their own terms. When tragedy strikes in the story I think we can genuinely sense a characters lose because we are allowed to know the person(s). The tragic irony of the recent shuttle accident and the opening scene in the movie does not go unnoticed. I congratulate Paramount with keeping the scene in the movie. That sequence was so well researched; there is no better visual way to explain a shuttles re-entry. How dangerous it really is and how fragile/vulnerable that spacecraft is in the scale of things. NASA does an amazing job and the men and women who fly those missions are not only very talented they are some of the bravest of the brave. We should watch that sequence knowing that the work they do is done willingly and with the betterment of humanity as their dream. Finally this is a movie and it does entertain. That said people need to learn to not take these stories so seriously. There will always be flaws in any movie you watch. It is really a miracle they ever make it to the theatres. There are so many creative elements that must come together to make a movie. THE CORE had a crew of over three hundred people. I would really love to see one of these critics try to work the hours we as a film crew work in order to put even a minutes worth of film in the can.I will close with, go to see The Core or any other movie for that matter, support our film industry by going to your local theatres.

These films are shot on film not video and as such they are designed to be projected onto a forty-foot screen for your viewing pleasure. Thanks.",The Core
400,davidmay,Logic takes a beating,1,28 April 2006,"This expose is for people who have seen the movie and can't quite put their finger on why they have come away feeling so dirty. Well people, following are a few reasons why The Core poops all over science along with having the worst plot, characters and premise of all time. Firstly, that little speech the physicist gave to the class about sound traveling through rocks? He says something about the wavelength increasing (ding right), and then says the frequency will decrease (bzzz wrong). Frequency stays the same regardless of the medium it is traveling through. It is the wavelength that will in fact decrease.Secondly, what's with the explanation of how the Earth is going to end? Burning a peach with a deodorant can? Come on, I know military people are considered no-brainers, but he was demonstrating this to the people that lead a high tech organization. This patronises any military personnel, as well as the audience. Thirdly, The premise of the film is based around the effects that occur because the core of the Earth stops rotating. Let me just first note that there are geological records to say that the magnetic field has changed direction many times in the past, with evidence to support that each time it has been reduced close to 0. To the best of my knowledge, and that of every history book out there, this happens without any of us combusting like the peach.Fourthly, the scene with the golden gate bridge heating up because of a hole in the magnetic field? I think someone got magnetic field and ozone layer mixed up. The idea of punching a hole in a field is absurd. The field may be weakened, but the atmosphere would still protect our little bridges from cosmic radiation.Fifthly, there is a force field (magnetic) around the Earth, not much of one, but there is one, not an ""electromagnetic energy field"". An energy field would do sweet f*ck all to deflect radiation. The same radiation that is supposed to wipe out humans like the peach... Sixthly, 5 200-megaton nukes? Come on, those would weigh about 250 tons together. Let's try transport that on the dildo shaped 'virgil'. And the computer simulations of how they would be set off? All in 1 spot? That wouldn't create the required rotational force, since there would be no rotational force due to symmetry. He finally gets it right in the end to place them apart from each other. How they initially overlooked this one, I have no idea.Seventhly, the material used to withstand all the pressure and temperature on 'virgil' was called 'unobtainium'. nuff said.Eighthly, assuming we just spent the entirety of the world's budget on developing paradoxically copious amounts of unobtanium, it would take another 10 budgets over to have the resources to ""control"" the internet.Ninthly, when 'virgil' was tunneling downwards, why could the people walk around inside as if it was horizontal? They mentioned the rotating bridge, but didn't mention anything about rotating hallways, or the rip in the space-time continuum needed to walk straight between the bridge and the subsequent hallways. The compartments would need to rotate individually, which would put them out of alignment with each of the other compartments. Logically, they would be aligned parallel for everyone to be walking horizontal, and not fall to the front of the ship, as the front is pointing towards the centre of the Earth. If only they could pretend virgil was round, and the entire inside could rotate as one. A pity every shot shows a long cylindrical ship incapable of this.Tenthly, the giant geode that they crash into? All that pressure, all that temperature? But if that wasn't enough, they get out, and walk around. I know those space suits they had on looked cool, but they couldn't withstand the ~1000 degrees of temperature, and a few thousand kPa of pressure that is needed to keep the geode from collapsing under the weight of the world. Eleventhly, when the ship springs a leak? It would have been like a nuke going off in the ship, but instead, it took a few minutes for the compartment to crush. Twelfthly, the unlucky guy that has to walk through 9000 degrees temperature in a suit only designed to withstand 5000 degrees. He makes it to the duct and switches the lever? 9000 degrees is about 2-3 times the temperature of a nuclear bomb going off. I think the walls and floor of the corridor would have been glowing white with heat. Our man would have been vaporised, but lucky for him, only his converse pumps melted to get to the lever. Thirteenthly, the guy that pulls out the plutonium rods undergoing fission? He didn't even have a helmet on. $10 says his kids will have 5 noses, 3 mouths, and a foot coming out of their heads. I guess it's a good thing though that the DNA of such a twit is wiped from our society in these industrial accidents.Fourteenthly, when the power cut out from the lack of reactor rods, they hook up the power cables to the inner hull. Where do they put the ground? There needs to be a potential drop for power to be gained, and if there was a ground, then anyone that touched the hull would have been electrocuted. Fifteenthly, the arming code for the nukes was the first four prime numbers... 1 2 3 5... Pretty sure 1 is not a prime number. Well, thats about all, and thats not even going into the fact about how the core could stop spinning in the first place. Thanks for your time.",The Core

412,fluxmonkey,A general warning:,1,12 January 2008,"The act of watching a movie and how it is taken by the viewer is very subjective. So, let me phrase this correctly: If you are able to ignore logic and science and the competent development of a premise; if you basically watch movies for explosions and movement on the screen... Well... I'd still only give it a five (of ten). Yet, if you have the pesky habit of listening to the words that people are saying and attempting to understand: You may not want to watch this movie. You may want to put it down and back away slowly. I'm trying my hardest not to completely bad-mouth this, but this is the first movie that I have had to force myself to finish in years. And I mean FORCE. I came beck to it three times. I was not a physics major, but the abuse of every common law of our known reality is evident in this film. The premise itself is skewed, which does not bother me. Many movies have been made with obviously flawed legs to stand on, as plot goes, but there is usually an equally obscure solution and implementation that leaves enough gray-zone of doubt to make it comprehensible. Either that or it is covered up with enough humor to make it light-hearted and watchable... Take the Armageddon example: With the resulting action and dialogue from Steve Buscemi, Bruce Willis, and that crazy Cosmonaut, and I really didn't care that the premise flopped a few times. In 'The Core' there is more room for error, since we are not dealing with the obvious unknowns that may occur on an asteroid; we are looking at the physical rules of this planet alone. On top of that the action was lame and dragging, with very little humor or believability. I'll make one example that peeved me the most: The movie did not even follow the laws of gravity. The cockpit of the 'drill' was a sphere on a swivel that kept it upright, yet when people left the cockpit to travel to other parts of the vehicle they were walking upright in the cabins, even though they should have been drawn 90 degrees downward. Pressure due to depth and gravity also was not uniform, making entire portions laughable at best. I have not had to shut a movie off halfway through this many time in my recollection... It's just that the errors made me grind my jaw to the point of pain. If you think that you could ignore physics, be my guest... But I usually can watch movie like this to laugh at, only this time it was just sad. Man... Oh... One other thing I have to note: If one is to write dialogue for a GENIUS, they must worry about how they sound... Maybe send the script around to the scientific community to see if any real genius would get caught dead saying half these lines. It is a difficult task to take on... don't think that you can do it alone. I should wrap this up, I could whine for an hour on various points, but who wants to read that? I am only trying to warn any watcher of movies that cares for similar things that I do when viewing films. Please put this down and walk away. Rent Event Horizon... Something that will make you happy, at least. Please.

The movie hit rock bottom when the characters got out of their ship into a geode that couldn't possibly exist. The temperature was about 9000 degrees and they're walking around in aluminum foil suits(witch conduct heat and energy). The only good part of the movie is when the guy who made DESTINY dies. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had a conscious thought or has an IQ equivalent to a small stone.

There are several instances of blatant neglect, but overall, the science is good.  And the parts where they jump the gun and shoot off the scientific radar are compensated for by the fact that they invent ways to get around it.The movie is a run of the mill save everyone by killing yourself type flick, but it does keep you interested, and gives a much needed update to the genre of exploring what is beneath us.

For some reason you'd think there would be some quality acting amongst all these well known actors, but something has gone terribly wrong here. The issue itself is probably that this was too much to pack into one short movie. The movie has presents some facts in the early stages that gives indication to some quality but it goes terribly wrong when it jumps between being a comedy and drama when presenting new characters and introducing their personalities. It all goes down the drain when they start their journey into the core of the earth. It feels like there has been no real research in what might happen when you drill into the core. Even if the viewer has no clue as to what that might look like there, you just know it's nothing like what you see in the movie. It seriously depreciates the viewer. Bottom line - no good.",The Core

You also have Aaron Eckhart doing a workman like job. Zimski who is played by Stanley Tucci is a great character. There is a computer geek in the movie that is developed in an very interesting character. Have watched it since on TV, if you like science fiction you will definitely like this film. As you can see there is lots of characters that were fairly well developed. The special effects are excellent also.

Something threatens to destroy the planet so we retaliate and try to stop it, or in this case, fix it. I thought the way the film makers displayed the catastrophic events was well done.

Well I have to say that the story reminded me strongly of that of 'Armageddon': you know the world is in jeopardy and someone has to save it. They put together a bunch of very different personalities that travel into the center of the world to get the core start spinning again. All goes terribly wrong underway, but... :-) Nevertheless I have to say that the characters are played well, there's some good humor in it and the special effects are really great. If you love good disaster movies, go and see it.",The Core
425,ei8htohms,So bad it's good.,6,6 April 2003,"I have a weakness for Hollywood blockbusters. Even more embarrassingly, I have an especially soft spot for special effects films. You know the kind, dominated largely by grandiose special effects with a ridiculously unbelievable ""story"" designed solely to string together the explosions and computer generated graphics.I saw Independence Day on opening weekend, Armageddon in the first week of its opening, etc., etc. I love these films. Every once in awhile they surprise me and are even pretty good. I can't think of an example of that off the top of my head but I'm sure there have been one or two. More often though, they are so bad they're good. The Core might be just such a film.Apocalypse movies are pretty fascinating from a sociological standpoint. In the seven-O's and eight-0's it was enough for us to fantasize about an airliner full of passengers or maybe an entire cruise ship being destroyed but at some point in the nine-0's we decided that just wasn't enough carnage. It became important for all of us to be killed. Whether we be disintegrated by aliens, wiped out by an unstoppable virus or destroyed by an asteroid, nothing short of biblical destruction of the entire human race would satisfy our collective blood/entertainment-lust.
Continuing with this invigorating theme, The Core constructs a wonderfully bizarre morbid-fantasy about the rapidly spinning outer core of the earth stopping because of a doomsday machine made by the bad military men. We're told that the ill-effects of our global heart failure will include some wacky electro-magnetic disturbances and ultimately the failure of our entire electro-magnetic protection blanket that keeps out the nasty microwaves from the sun (or something like that, it's best not to pay too much attention to the scientific details when watching such a film).Well it wouldn't be nearly dramatic enough to just have some slow subtle build-up of these nasty EM problems. More importantly though, it wouldn't be in keeping with the template of these types of films. The formula dictates that we get to see some increasingly brutal scenes of devastation peppered with scenes of puny humans struggling desperately at some hail-mary solution to fend off armageddon.If you're planning to actually see this film and want to be surprised every now and again, stop reading now. I'm about to give away some big gags.
The first failure in the movie is a quartz watch. It was probably about that time that I decided, ""I think I'm gonna like this film."" Next though, the pacemakers fail within a 10 block radius (I never had any idea how many pacemaker wearers there are! they're practically everywhere!). That's bad.After a little bit of plot unfolding (or perhaps it was character development?), the birds start freaking out and killing themselves. Something about their use of magnetic fields to guide their migratory patterns or some such. This was pretty silly and in the context of the rest of the movie that means it was fantastically silly. I mean so silly that it went right through the part of bad where it's actually good and broke through to the side where it's really bad again.Then we get into the plot big-time. Oh yeah, at some point the space shuttle has to land in one of those great big LA drainage ditches. You know, I'm convinced those ditches were just built to show up in movies. Whether they be the backdrop for Arnold jumping a Harley Davidson over a semi-truck, a drag racing duel with Travolta driving Greased Lightning or Kurt Russel surfing a tsunami, these damn ditches have seen it all. I can't really remember when the space shuttle crashed there but it served as the introduction to two of our heroes: a guy and a girl astronaut (don't worry, I won't bog you down with the names of these puny humans).So anyway, we also get introduced to some scientists (this movie has a lot of scientists in it, it must be really smart), some military guys (and girls), another scientist (who has issues with one of the other scientists, ooh the air was thick with drama) and a hacker (did you know that having a hacker hero is a prerequisite for a good effects film these days?). One of the scientists is a messy haired guy who's kinda cute so we instinctively cling to him as our hero of heroes. Oh yeah, the Nasa girl is kinda cute too.I think some other stuff happened at this point involving building a ship to tunnel into the center of the earth and plant some nuclear weapons or some such but more importantly, we get to see some really kick-ass lightning storms. These storms are so bad-ass that they level Rome in fact. No kidding. They blow up the coliseum and a lot of ancient Roman looking buildings. Destroying national, international and/or global symbols is very important in these films. It's a way of convincing our collective psyche that this is REALLY BIG STUFF. Really old and important stuff getting blown up makes it seem all the more, um, important or something.Now the effects are not really so great by modern CGI standards. I mean they were fine in a cartoonish sort of way but don't expect to really be convinced by any of them. When a rogue lightning bolt tears down the middle of a street (in Rome presumably) and throws giant chunks of asphalt everywhere as it goes, well, I dunno, it just didn't move me the way I really wanted it to. Perhaps I was distracted by thinking about our heroes in the laser-ultrasound-nuclear-powered-love-train tunneling to the center of the earth.So our wonder-worm, sole-hope-of-humanity vehicle is really flying through the solid rock and molten lava and crystal gardens and mazes of huge diamonds (not even a wonder worm can cut through diamond my friends!). I mean it is cruising. I don't know how fast a knot is, but it was doing hundreds of 'em, protected from the crushing pressure and tremendous heat only by its Unobtainium shell (how could I make that up?) and some occasional squirts of liquid nitrogen (or perhaps it was a continual mist? they never really showed how that worked).At one point our heroes do have to get out (in the crystal garden) but thankfully their tin-foil suits can take the pressure (whew! I was really worried for a second there!). Nevertheless, they do start getting picked off and wouldn't you know it? The poorly developed (and I mean even in relation to what passes for character development in this film) Nasa guy is the first to go! Of well, the worm must go on.So then some nonsense transpires about the outer core (of molten iron, that the ships cuts through like a hot knife) not being as dense as we thought (iron is tricky stuff apparently) so our heroes don't have enough nukes and the secret of the secret weapon (cleverly named: Destiny) comes out and the hacker has to save the day and another scientist dies, blah, blah, blah, but then we get to see the Golden Gate bridge get destroyed!
Clearly this is what we've all been waiting for. No, we didn't know specifically what was going to get blown up in some grandiose fashion but, by golly, we knew our hard earned cash was going to buy us some destruct-ifaction and the Golden Gate bridge turns out to be the fatted calf at the alter of our morbid pleasure. And it was pretty great I gotta say.You might not know it (being that we all pretty much live in blissful ignorance of how badly the universe wants to squash/pummel/torch or otherwise squeeze the life out of us at every turn), but the EM field around our planet saves us all the time from the aerosol-can-flamethrower that is our sun. When the EM field breaks down, watch out, microwaves of hell (microwaves from the heavens doesn't sound as scary) will boil the water right in the sea, give you a really bad sunburn in seconds flat, melt your car tires and blow up the Golden Gate bridge like nobody's business!
This scene was pretty darn good. My only complaint is that we only get to hear from the newscasters how half of San Francisco got destroyed. I would've gladly paid an extra $3.25 or so to see the Transamerica building blown up or my favorite taquerias go up in flames. I guess they wanted our imaginations to fill in the blanks. Whatever, if I wanted to use my imagination I'd read a damn book!So then our heroes develop some screwball plan to place there nukes in very specific places (accurate to within one inch!) with very specific timing (accurate to within a fraction of a second!) to get the shockwaves to compound itself or something. I dunno. Obviously this wasn't all that important because they forget about the time schedule pretty quickly (ejecting the cars/nukes seemingly at random, and darn close together plot-wise) and set the nukes' timers by hand (computers can't be trusted for such precise timing operations).What is important is that another scientist gets killed by walking into a part of the ship that is 9,000 degrees! His tin-foil suit only protects him long enough to disengage the auto-locking mechanism between the cars on the worm-train before his glasses shatter from the heat and he dies a (very painful) several seconds later. I don't know that he was in that much pain but the rest of us were anyway.The scientists are really dropping like flies now so I'm really appreciating how they stocked the movie up so throughly with them in the first place. Now there's only a couple of them left (and the girl astronaut).So anyway, another scientist gets trapped in one of the cars they have to eject (the only way they can deploy the nukes for some reason, I learned that word ""deploy"" from some other Hollywood gem I'm sure) by the massive nuke laying on top of him (the script writers weren't sure which scientist was going to get it at first so the messy haired scientist has the nuke laying on him for a brief moment too). Just before they eject his car off into the molten iron (which they are still just flying through!), he spits out something about needing more plutonium to make the last nuke go off big enough to fully jump start the earth's core (I'm not a scientist myself so the subleties of wave motion in molten iron went right over my head).
Well, luckily all you have to do to supe-up a nuke is to throw some extra plutonium at it and they happen to have some extra plutonium in the worm-train's engine! Ok, it's not really extra plutonium as pulling it out shuts down the ship (not to mention the fact that it's super hot and they don't have any oven mits, just those damn tin-foil suit gloves) but apparently that's ok.Hmm, wait a second. If they pull out the plutonium and stop the ship so they can add the plutonium to the last bomb, how can they get away from it before it explodes? Maybe they were going fast enough that they could just glide through the lava for awhile after ejecting or something like that. I dunno, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. But anyway, they did it, the bombs all blow up, they don't get killed and guess what? The earth is saved!Some other stuff happens at this point (not the least of which is some groovy waves in the Sahara) to wrap things up and put a nice little bow on the plot, roll credits.This movie is possibly the most successful multi-million dollar B-movie I've seen in at least a few weeks. It was way more enjoyable than Phone Booth and almost as good as the last episode of Third Watch I saw (which wasn't all that great) and I highly recommend it for all fans of mindless science fiction, big-budget effects films which fixate on human carnage on a global scale. It is a flickering flourescent bulb, dimly glowing (periodically) in this venerable genre._john",The Core
426,planetpeck,"The Core lacks a core, but I enjoyed it",6,13 April 2003,"I went to see The Core because I had nothing better to do yesterday evening, I like science fiction and because I had heard that it has a sense of humor about itself.Jon Amiel's `The Core' is a thread spun by the Hollywood Action/Adventure machine that ends up as a quilt of characters and plotlines from other movies.  It's warm, thin, flat and you may find that after the film your toes are cold, even despite the 9000 degree heat on the screen.As this quilt unfolds, you find the arrogant scientist from `Contact' (better developed in that movie by Tom Skerritt) who has, in the end, an epiphany spun from a few puffs on a Camel Light.  You see the kid (and part of the plot) from War Games only updated with a Hot Pocket habit and a scarier neck.  You find the French guy with the heart of gold from...well.France, whose character you think must have been something before the cutting room floor.  To the film's credit, there is a warmer, less generic version of Ben Affleck's character in Armageddon, better played in this move by Aaron Echhart.There are many, ahem, quotations (to put it nicely) of plot and character from such epics as Journey To The Center of the Earth, Fantastic Voyage (although without the onboard treachery), EARTHQUAKE!, and even `The Birds,' along with many other film fragments, all served up on floating lake of hot magma.Now I'm not a scientist, and I'm hopeful that the geology was relatively accurate, but I have a real problem with someone reaching in to an active nuclear reactor, flipping a few circuit breakers, yanking out the control rods and dragging some distance.  Okay, even if I could suspend my disbelief about that, I just can't make the leap when, thereafter, there is a) no melt down, and b) no physical side-effects other than a pair of bandaged hands. It was the nuclear science of Dr. Christmas Jones in `The World Is Not Enough' more attractively played in that film by a jump-suited Denise `If I don't get that plutonium back, somebody's gonna have my butt' Richards.Good news and bad news on the special effects: `The Birds' thing was good, but the exterior shots of the ship running through ocean, crust, mantle, etc., looked like Irwin Allen's 1961 `Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea' - you could almost see the strings!  And a note to Hollywood: please stop destroying San Francisco.  Couldn't you pick some other town to destroy? I know it's an easy target, but c'mon.As the Griffin Mill character says in Altman's stunning 1992 film ""The Player:' ""I was just thinking what an interesting concept it is to eliminate the writer from the artistic process. If we could just get rid of these actors and directors, maybe we've got something here.""

And Gratefully - No Gratuitous Junk! Overall, the movie is definitely worth seeing. For those interested:  While there is debate in the scientific community as to the time and frequency, the earth's magnetic polarity does, in fact, shift periodically.  This is proven in the geological record.  North becomes south and south becomes north.  As to the core being a natural nuclear reactor that could, at any time, suddenly stop working, the only theory here is as to the when.  And given that scenario, life on earth would be a whole different supposition.  Also, for general edification:  In the late 1960's and 70's there was experimentation done on creating and using earthquakes as weapons.  (Human arrogance, greed, and stupidity have no limit.)  I have not (for a variety of reasons) kept up with the literature, so I don't know the current status of such blundering, though I fear the worst.

Pigeon-death anyone? ;-)I had to suspend my disbelief a mere 10 minutes into this film - disbelief not of the outlandish but intriguing plot, but rather of the fact that somebody somewhere pitched this movie to a studio successfully!

This movies few supporters try to say ""relax, and enjoy a mindless disaster flick.""The question is, exactly how mindless are we supposed to be? Should we completely remove our brain first by smashing our head on a rock until it falls out, because if so, I'll do it. It would surely be a hell of a lot less painful than watching this rancid mass of decay again. And I love mindless action flicks. The problem is even for a pure f/x only movie, it sucks. All the ""special"" (as in, short school bus special) effects look like they were done by some failing college students using their pirated and hacked version of 3D studio. During the space shuttle crash sequence, I was half expecting to see little strings attached as it bounced around like it was in a freaking puppet show.The ""acting"" (a very loose term) was below sub par, and everyone seemed like they hated the very movie they were acting in. Hilary Swank's character couldn't be any more plastic, annoying, and clichéd if she tried, and as for the rest of the cast, yuck. Delroy Lindo, was okay as Dr. Ed Brazzleton.

I just wish Dr. Brazzleton didn't have to die. He was my favorite. I could have gone without any of them dying with the exception of the commander. With him gone, Rebecca was able to take over the ship and lead most of them to safety. Serge we really didn't get to know all that much, so it didn't anger me as much when he died as everyone else. Dr. Zimsky was the antagonist of this whole movie. When two were dead and he saw it was almost impossible, he said to just go home. None of the others wanted to and the majority got it. Finally to Dr. Keyes. He was just the intelligent man of the whole trip. There were other roles that I like including the general and the flight director. Just a great movie all around.",The Core
443,dowdalltyler,It's fun,8,9 February 2019,"Turn your brain off, sit back and enjoy a character driven sci if movie. Seriously though the characters are what makes this, the Special effects are not ground breaking but it's still fun. It's ""the mummy"" for me, not a great film but very entertaining! Leave your critic mind behind and just enjoy this movie. I had fun.",The Core
444,qhhsspacelab,You Will Be Entertained,9,20 July 2018,"The science is questionable at best and laughable at worst but its all in pursuit of making a ridiculous and wonderful movie. Script aside, the cinematography and pacing were very good and for '03 the computer graphics were impressive. Its an interesting and original idea executed by taking every single Hollywood trope, throwing them in a hat, shuffling it about, and tossing it into a blank manuscript. This is by no means one of the best movies I've ever seen but I gave it a 9 because I enjoyed every minute of it, albeit not in the way the filmmakers intended.However, don't let that deter you. This movie is absurd but executed as a drama with high production value and you will most certainly be entertained by that juxtaposition.",The Core
445,GOATKEYS,Bad science and acting don't always = bad movie,4,6 November 2007,"Now don't get me wrong, this movie is quite bad! The Insultingly Bad Movie Physics site says it all, and even then there is more bad science. There is no suspension-of-disbelief so great as to possibly believe anything in this movie. And that's where the fun comes in (especially for MST3K fans, who are most assuredly making up amusing quips as they watch this movie.) I've never laughed so hard at unbelievable movie events! And I've never but so frustrated - actually talking back to the movie itself about the crazy crap-science on screen. And then I'll watch it again sometime later when I'm bored and I feel like some CGI disaster fun. And the cycle repeats, except I find more to laugh and be frustrated at!! Do I need help? Possibly. But if I need to make myself feel better about my science knowledge, I've got The Core!",The Core
446,desiguy415,This was a nice movie.......,9,20 September 2005,"I liked this movie because it showed a lot of new technology and showed the earth many different layers as the group of people headed to the blazing hot core of the earth. It was a very good movie if you compare it to the disaster movies that were made before. It showed how one day the world might get destroyed and how mankind is trying it's best to control it. I liked a few parts in this movie, the part when they showed this machine can just cut easily through a big piece of rock, also when they were down inside the earth and they found crystals that looked like very big diamonds to me. . I think this was one of the best movies in than disaster category that was made in 2003 and I think it should have a high rating.",The Core
447,bemby3,Great movie!,9,3 June 2007,"I love action movies, and i watched this one in the movie theater and afterward i just had to buy it on DVD for myself! Of course if you were any good in school you'll know that some stuff isn't possible (but really, nobody knows - a lot of impossible things tend to happen), at least not in this Millennnium, but...WHAT IF? It IS interesting, it IS funny, it GIVES you plausible explanation What, When, Why and What we (they) gotta do to prevent the catastrophe (something some other movies lack). Plus it is all action-filled (starting from the VERY beginning, i absolutely loved first scene, it draws attention, all right!), no abracadabras but something substantial to explain things that were happening, and very creative and funny! I loved everything about this movie, impossibility AND possibility, story line, side plots, dialogues, beautiful shots, inner core and my favorite part - the empty spots! Thank you so much for this great 2-hour-on-the-edge-of-the-seat movie!",The Core
448,ross-winning-1,Sub-Par-mageddon,6,24 July 2008,"Before we start I gave it six just because i have soft spot for crappy action movies, speed 2 springs to mind, i think its great, anyway. (You'd be forgiven for stopping reading now) The core is actually not as bad as it could or indeed is made out to be, the effects are good the acting is good, you've gotta love Delroy Lindo and Aaron Eckhart but Swank is not on form, i think she needs to stay away from action movies and a good director to get the best out of her. The story, yes, is insane but that didn't bother me, we all need to suspend our disbelief more than usual sometimes.But if you've seen Armageddon you've seen pretty much everything in this film except better. And the amount of things in this film that seem to be taken straight from Armageddon I'm surprised Bay doesn't sue. You can tell Jon Amiel has a wee penchant for Michael Bay, he uses the silhouette against the setting sun shot that Bay loves so much.If you like s****y action flicks like myself you give it a watch otherwise... best steer clear.",The Core

451,AlexCardoso1,Voyage to the heart of the Earth,6,29 January 2006,"In recent years,there has been a profusion of catastrophe movies.We have seen it all:tsunamis,volcanoes,tornadoes and hurricanes,asteroids... Some were about the end of the world .some were not. This is one of those movies. I was kind of surprised with this movie,because it's interesting,despite the unrealistic plot(I'm not a scientist,but if it could really happen,we would all be in very big,big trouble). Jon Amiel managed to do something good for us to see until the end and the casting was a very good one. After all,we don't see Hillary Swank or even Stanley Tucci making a ""blockbuster"" every day. The special effects could be more spectacular(although it's obvious that,like no one has never really seen it,we don't have means to compare the inside of the Earth),but I've seen worse. The soundtrack is at the same level that the movie. By this,I want to say that it does not pass the feelings that it should pass when we are watching the movie. It'just music that's playing while images are running. I also liked the fact that it had some ""gags"" throughout the movie.",The Core
452,artcadet,Excellent film of this genre,10,12 March 2006,"This film certainly had me on the edge of my seat. I consider it the best I have seen in a long time in this genre. The acting was superb. Regardless of the accuracy of the scientific data presented here, this movie was fun and exciting. It is, after all Sci-Fi. My husband who expected not to like it, put it on his favorite movies list. I found the screenplay to be excellent. The dialogue was good and the special effects were outstanding. I am rather surprised that this movie and the performers had not received more acclaim. In my opinion, this is a real sleeper. I highly recommend this movie for fun and thrills. I plan on buying it for my video library.",The Core
